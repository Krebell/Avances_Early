 Hahaha this is a good example of what I'm looking for though. I actually didn't see either of the newer Spidermans. Rebooting the Batmans made sense to me (because of years passed and newer technology) but Spiderman just seemed way too soon. I heard they were good though.    What is your favorite movie, its criticism and your defense for said criticism?   Especially their jam session at the end. I agree.   Yeah! I loved Whiplash and it definitely made me want to play percussion again.    And what do you say about music in movies? Or movies about music? You don't think that can be inspirational? Maybe I wasn't clear in my title. I didn't mean "What action scene inspired you to play the trombone?" lol    Are you saying you cannot be inspired by movies?    That Thing You Do inspired me to take up drums (for I am Spartacus) when I was a child. I'm a guitarist now, but always credit that movie as getting me started. What're yours?   He killed David Palmer too, you know. Fuck that guy.    That's what I mean by throw-back. The director was intentionally vague about the timeline. I mean, just the use of cellphones and whatnot, we can deduce it's a modern day movie, but the heavy use of synth music and the old-style movie theater, the cars, the black and white TVs. It was done intentionally to give you wide range of impressions and feelings. I suppose that doesn't work for everyone, but I enjoyed it.    I had the same reaction as you OP. But it was a really cool throw back to 70s/80s horror films with a peculiarly interesting new story. I think I appreciated it more than I liked it, if that makes sense.     One more thing....does she know her daughter is still alive *cue the trumpets   He wasn't a friend to the MC, but he wasn't a villain either. I guess we'd have to establish what we mean by "villain." If you're implying anyone against the MC, then he would qualify. But that's like saying Hank is the villain of Breaking Bad because the main character is Walter White.    Why is he being defined as a villain?   One of the most overused phrases on this sub, dude.    Roger Workman      Okay, that makes sense. Thanks for responding.    Can you please respond to my question below when you get a moment?    Eve was into oranges. Everybody knows that. Duh.    Thank you for this. It helped immensely.    THANKS EVE, YA JERK!   So all who are Christian are elect?   Yeah, I feel like there should be a better word than "election" to describe the situation.    Wouldn't the Cross be pointless if there was unconditional election? I feel like I'm still fuzzy on the particulars here. I thank you for your response.   It all started one day in Eden....   Hi guys! First time poster on this sub. I'm a fairly new believer (little over a year or so) and have a question about this word: Elect. Let me preface my question with saying I don't believe God is ever surprised. Therefore it should come as no shock to Him when someone becomes saved. By this thought, you could say that all who are saved are "elect" because God knew they would come to Christ. But then why make the distinction? Why aren't the "elect" just called Christians? It may just be my misunderstanding of the term, but it stings my ears when I hear people say "elect." Even if I, myself, are "elect," I still hate the title. Can someone please explain to me where my misunderstanding is? It would mean a lot.   You're right, it is not. Reddit is full of idiots. FULL of them.    House of the Devil better than The Conjuring? Are you fucking high?   Chicken Run Ronnie Run Fatboy Runaway Jury  	29
 One of these guys, the 35 year old, was a good friend of mine.  I'm not going to reveal his name, but my thoughts are with his family.         The BlackTron collection was the best.   I would say the female lead, but yes I agree.   So is Michael Bay using Megan Fox as the lead female in all his movies based on favorite toys from my childhood?   I think I can already see the drum circle forming.  If they are not careful if could become a full-fledged music festival.  Call Cartman.   And for those of you who haven't been there...no alcohol  	8
 This past week I went to the new Diagon Alley section of Universal Studios. I was not disappointed. Hogsmeade was amazing, and Diagon Alley only added to that. Going through the park, you can ride the Hogwarts Express and walk through a brick wall. The only problem is that you don't know you're doing it. Other people can see it, but you just see yourself walking through a door way. After riding both ways, my boyfriend and I hadn't found the wall, so we decided to ask about it. We, not thinking, asked on the Muggle London side. When I asked, the worker gave me a very confused look and informed me that there was Platforms 9 and 10 and if I wanted, I could throw quarters at the wall. She also advised I not walk through a wall because it would hurt. I walked away no closer to the wall, and yet I was completely satisfied. Later, my family (me representing Gryffindor and my mom and boyfriend representing Slytherin) were approached by a dark looking witch. Conversation is as follows: Witch (W): "You keep good company, Gryffindor!" Me: "I don't think so" with a grin. Witch: "Where is your wand?!" Me: "It's at home. I forgot it." Witch: "You better be careful especially in Knockturn Alley. It isn't safe for a Gryffindor witch. Better hope your friends protect you."  It was an amazing experience! Delicious Cottage Pie in the Leaky Caldron. Amazing Deathly Hallows show. Wonderful ice cream! Everyone should consider trying to make a trip, but I suggest staying at a resort to get early entry. Escape from Gringotts was a 5 hour wait by the third ride!   I looked at her recent posts, and 4 days ago she posted about feeling like someone is watching her. Then 68 days ago she said she didn't feel safe anymore. That's really scary.   With this scam, I assumed the "scientific code" was the number to a prepay card he had already stolen, so when I would type it in, the money would go on to his card and not the one I rang up. Then I would need to cash it out to be activated.   It's a good thing that I work nightshift, and only have to see her an hour every shift   Sorry about formatting and errors! I'm on mobile! I posted a little while back about my douche manager and did pretty well, so I'm going to do another about the douche daytime supervisor... She's not even my boss  If you missed my first post, I work in a regional grocery store putting up sale signs and hanging price tags on night shift. Of course, my boss was on vacation. Bad things always happen when he leaves. We got a phone call to the store after hours. The person claimed to be the store manager and asked to speak to someone who could run a register. I was the only one there who could, so I go to the phone. He tells me that he's my boss (not the store manager). So, I'm already suspicious, but since they're both named Michael, I thought maybe the man that answered the phone misheard. He proceeds to tell me to grab a pay as you go money card, put money on it, and he would give me a "scientific code" to put into the register, cash it out, and put it and the receipt on his desk. I tell him that he should know I can't cash out a transaction without the customer being there, but he can call back when the front line boss comes in. He then asks when they'll come in. I already know this is clearly not my boss or the store manager because they would know when the morning shift came in. So I tell him at 6:00 am when the store opens. He yells at me and tells me that he's the store manager and knew when the store opened and that he needed the cards done before 6am. I apologize and continue to tell him I can't do said transaction. He hangs up on me.  When the day shift boss comes in, I tell her about the scam. She yells at me for doing the transaction. My mouth drops at first and I stare at her. When she's done yelling, I tell her I didn't do. She then proceeds to tell me I did a good job but never apologizes for yelling even though I told her at the beginning that I didn't do the transaction. Later, when I check my company email, it turns out another store in the area fell for the scam and lost $10,000.  Did she really think I was that dumb?!   Thank you! He was recently promoted to manager, and his head is huge now... He was bad before. He's unbearable now.   Please excuse grammar and formatting! I'm on mobile   I work in a regional grocery store putting up signs and changing price tags. Corporate expects 1089 tags hung in 8 hours. My department manager was on vacation. I'm the only one trained to do my job and his, so I'm doing both of our jobs for only 50 cents more. My company doesn't allow overtime, so I had to ask the store manager to let me leave early because I had 5000 tags to hang in one night. Clearly, I couldn't get it done, so I was gonna go over. When I ask him, he seems confused about why I have so many hours. I inform him that since my boss is on vacation that's I'm working both jobs. He's still confused about why my department gets 40 hours a week. We hang every sale sign and make sure every price is right every day.  Fast forward to later that day, I'm walking around the store making sure all our major sale signs are correct. Up comes the store manager, he asks if I will clean the break room. He didn't seem urgent, and he didn't specify when. I agree assuming he means after I check prices which is more important. Not 5 minutes later, he runs back up to me asking if I cleaned the break room. I reply, "Sorry, Sir. I was going to do it after I checked prices." He proceeds to yell in my face and tell me we have "enough" signs. So I drop what I'm doing to clean the PRIVATE break room.  I'm finally done with the break room and go back to the floor. As I walk past the deli area, I hear douche manager yelling at them for not having a sign up that they had asked me to make, so I walk over, give him my nicest smile, and say "Sir, I was on my way to make that sign when you told me we had enough and that cleaning the break room was more important." He storms away because I didn't do anything to actually get in trouble.  Fast forward not even 20 minutes later, he comes to find me to ask if I'll make a sign for a bread rack. When I go to check prices, I realize they're all different prices, and I don't have room to make a sign for every thing. I tell my manager. He yells in my face again asking why I can't just do my job. I proceed to walk over to the rack and make a sign for the cheapest item on there so if anyone complains about the price of a more expensive item on the rack, they'll get it for the price of the cheapest one. Clearly, my manager hasn't a clue about my job!  Edit: Minor grammar fixes   Oh good! Hopefully it'll help! :)   My gosh! I can't imagine that. I've heard Alzheimer's is horribly hard to watch. Your stories just make me more worried about my parents getting it. I'm so sorry for you family. I'm not sure what else to say.   I'm sorry you went through that!   I'm a Psychology major, and one of the theories involved behavior of older people. We learned that older people who are mean and hateful are unhappy and regretful about their life. While happy, nice older people are generally content and satisfied with the life they've lead. I don't know which is sadder mental illness or being so miserable with your life that your mean to people.  	11

It was bent, in a way it would appear to defy all common laws. He stared at it for weeks. His wife was concerned about him, he just stared at it. Until he realized it was fake, the lamp didn't exist. He woke up shortly after in the hospital bed. He had severe depression and couldn't cope anymore. He had lived 40+ years with a woman he loved, and a child he had, he said he sometimes sees the kid in his phericpheral.    Can you leave the shit face hole you live in?

I can never be a laborer, I'm not willing to fatigue my body for a living, instead I want to heal people mentally and physically. Same for jobs that face violence every day, e.x  police, military excursions. It just depends on the person. Not saying neither of any jobs is bad or great. It's just what you want to do with your life.    I respectfully disagree with you, ask any person studying for endless hours in college and they will tell you other wise. It's a sacrifice trying to remember pointless material you'll only use twice- on the midterm and final. People want a certain job. No one wants to work, but that's not how the world works.    To be fair, no one wants to do anything of those, except the bottom one. No one wants to pick trash up, but people do.    In my experience nothing but time can heal this type of wound. Not everyone can or will recover. Only through therapy I can honestly say he will be better with an external source. Other than that, he might become an addict of some sort to relieve the pain.

Don't give up, OP!    1) You pay the payment on the credit card website. Look at the credit's websites for a "Make payment" button and enter a bank account, whom you will be making the payment from.  2) As far as I know, it's best to use the card each month, so it will be "active" and will show a history of credit. Of course pay in full each month.   Personal advice: Discover Student is the way to go, I got it when I turned 18.   Try using Cricket as your phone provider. It is GSM network (ANnT towers) I pay $35 a month for everything unlimited, including 4gLTE internet, (2.5gs, after it throttles to 4g) (also don't use their cheapy ass, welfare phones) (buy an unlocked phone for GSM and use cricket service) I have a Note 4, and paying the shittest price ever.    social media is a terrible habit if you don't use it as a tool to be productive in life e.x right way to use it: message your friends.

 Freeloader.   Brit here who works in France a lot - I never really worry about it, and just switch sides without difficulty. You just get used to it.  That said, I find driving on the right to be more comfortable. No idea why.   Read: "I didn't like it as the jokes just flew right by me. NURSE! NURSE!"   France loves chips (fries, if you're a Merkin). In Belgium they are more or less the national dish.  Yes, European food tends to be more realistically sized, but chips for every meal does nothing for the waistline!  Source: my fat ass in France.   Actually, much of Clue isn't actually made up on the spot and this line clearly wasn't, but it's very fair to say that those who think quickest do best and that the funniest bits are the off-script parts.

This is on a tiny island (read: rock in the sea) called Staffa near the Isle of Mull which is itself near the west coast of Scotland.  Staffa is a magical place but Mull and Iona (another small island) are two of my favourite places in the world and are certainly amongst the most beautiful places you can visit.  Mull was recently voted into the top 10 best islands in Europe and considering the competition, this should give and indication of how well people regard it.  http://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/TravelersChoice-Islands-cTop-g4  (In fact, Scotland appears no less than three times in the list so why are you sat reading this!

They know when they can challenge us and sometimes, frankly, they're right to do so. I want my kids to be independent and, these days at least, I rarely need to impose my will - they know what's right and wrong.  Exercising this judgement is one of the cool things about parenting.  That said, when needed, my authority is absolute. Rarrr!   Tough one, but:  "Bring them up to understand that: a) wrongdoing (even accidental) deserves an apology and b) Your parents' word is law"  I.e. refusing to apologise simply wouldn't happen.  My kids are awesome and generally wouldn't even need prompting in this regard. As a result, they get to do a lot more things with us as there's pretty much nowhere that we wouldn't take them. I love being a parent (most of the time, anyway!)   Rock Music Rule #1: If your guitar solo isn't immediately preceded by "GEEETAR!" then it's not a real guitar solo.   True, but if you buy an expensive electrical item that fails in, say, 18 months, wouldn't you have a sensible expectation that the product didn't last a reasonable amount of time?  UK returns law is largely rooted in this concept. If you buy something that costs 10 you have a much lower expectation of longevity than if you bought something for 1000. So if that 1k washing machine fails after 18 months on a 12 month warranty, you'd certainly have a good case against the retailer (not: *not* the manufacturer - you're contract is with the person you bought it from)   In the UK, your contract of purchase is with the store you bought it from and it's their responsibility to resolve the issue.  That said, many do back this service off to the manufacturer, which is OK *if* the service is acceptable....   Yes, I've noticed much the same in many (but not all) of the replies on this topic.  Interesting... I wonder how much the somewhat materialistic, US-centric audience affects this?  	33
 Got 1.  But the more I think about the more I feel like ill wait a week before deciding on a trade.  This isn't something I need to do.   I feel the same way but the other person is adamant in involving Allen.    I am currently 8-1 and looking to upgrade at QB and maximize my starting lineup potential for the playoffs. The playoffs are weeks 15-17. The top 2 seeds get a bye, I am the 2nd seed and am facing the top seed this week. My current roster is as follows:  QB: Alex smith, Mike Glennon, Vick (EJ Manuel is on waivers as well)  RB: Eddie Lacy, Staced God, Spiller, Ellington, CJ Anderson, Johnathan Franklin  WR: Antonio Brown, Keenan Allen, Eric Decker, Mike Brown  TE: Jimmy Graham  DST: Titans K: Hartley  Standard Espn scoring  The trade is as follows: I'm giving up Allen, Ellington, Alex Smith, CJ Anderson and either Antonio Brown or Decker (still unsure on which one, any help with that would also be nice!)  I will receive: Andrew Luck, Dez Bryant, Steve Smith, David Wilson, Robert Woods.  I also have a trade offer of Big Ben for Ellington waiting in the wings if this trade doesn't happen.  So what should I do?  Thanks for anyone who bother reading this. And thank you even more for those who would even bother answering!   Hhaha I just responeded to your other comment.  And I complete forgot about the trade thread. Ill just move this over there then.   Fair points.  I do feel like I should wait a week or 2 before deciding on making such a drastic move. EJ manuel is also a FA so I may drop someone for him.  I ended up making another thread to hopefully get some more input on this.  But again thanks!   Also thanks for the help   I could do an Ellington for Big Ben trade. But I think I would still prefer the starting lineup that the previous trade would produce.  I'm in no rush to make a trade.  It's just that I feel the need to maximize my starting lineup.  Having Decker, Spiller, or Elington on my bench seems like a waste.  And also most other teams seem hesitant to let go of their QB1.   I'm pulling off a big trade in a 16 team league.  I'm 8-1 and looking to get and upgrade at QB and maximize my starting lineup for the playoffs.    I have Glennon, Vick and alex smith at QB.  RBs are Stacey, Lacy, Spiller, ellington, cj anderson and johnathan franklin.  WRs are Brown, Decker, and Keenan Allen. TE is graham.   I'll be packaging Allen, Ellington, Alex smith, cj anderson, and either Decker or Brown for Andrew luck, Dez Bryant, Steve Smith, David Wilson and Robert woods.  So I'm stuck deciding who I would rather have for the rest of the year, Brown or Decker   I'm leaning towards Brown at the moment.  He gets more targets plus I feel like the Denver Broncos will slow down.   It depends on the severity of the break.  I do remember Ryan matthews needing 4-6 weeks to recover from it last year.  Either way there is no definitive timetable atm.  That will come later on in the week with more tests scheduled for Rodgers, according to a radio interview he just did.  Here's a link by from Bill Barnwell's twitter: http://www.texnews.com/1998/cowboys/ftwaik0914.html Aikman needed 6 weeks to come back.  But again there still isnt enough info and at this point there is just alot of speculation.    I was tempted to buy low on him earlier on but after hearing the interview I've grown hesitant.  Might just have to settle for Big Ben in a trade.   Why would it be vetoed? I'm not colluding, I'm attempting to buy low on a player who looks to be out for 3 weeks.   Yes you should   Im 8-1, in a 16 team league and setting up for the playoff.  I'm looking to trade for a qb and was targeting Rodgers.  What would a fair offer be? I'm willing to trade Eric Decker, Spiller and Ellington.  Would 2 of the 3 be fine? Also the other team is 3-6 and only has reggie bush as a viable player.   This is the list of ROS ranking for RBs coming into Sunday from FantastPros: http://www.fantasypros.com/nfl/rankings/ros-rb.php   The only RBs I'd rather have (in no particular order) would be AD, charles, McCoy, Lynch, Forte, Bush, Morris, Lacy, Gore, Moreno.  So I would have him at 11.  What do you guys think?   I havae both in a 16 team league and prefer Stacy mainly beacaue we know what his role is and will be going forward. Who knows what Arians plans to do with Ellington.  Also the Rams oline looked fantastic against seahawks front 7.  Meanwhile a week before the Cardinals oline looked absolutely awful against the same seahawks front 7.  	15
 Three point shooting is horrendous for both teams but the Nets are actually getting good looks.   Classic Mushishi bitter-sweetness.  I love the metaphorical use of the cold and snow to express Toki's feeling of numbness after losing his sister. Then use Tae's warmth to express the feeling of caring and comfort that helped Toki to move on. Very simple but well executed.    believe-in-yourself motivational nonsense  Sure it's overplayed in the sports genre (across all mediums) but I wouldn't call it nonsene. Top athletes don't reach the highest level of their craft without self-confidence, self-motivation and being pushed by someone.   In terms of romance:  Cross Game  Nana  Honey and Clover   Chaika could be another case of the lesser hyped Bones' show being the better one. Too bad it doesn't have the Noragami production values.   Sigh. No English subs. I was hoping to add this to my Spring schedule. Oh well, I'll just watch the movie series whenever it comes up in my backlog.   Shedding manly tears has been passed down the Armstrong line for generations.   Oh boy, I started welling up when I read the "God please..." line. The notion that's she's begging in her diary to remember all these memories was just so sad.   This show has an AMAZING soundtrack.   The way this show presents different story elements is so disjointed. There's just too much stuff going and the show is not doing much in a way of making sense of them. It was kind of forgivable after the 1st episode but after the 2nd one it becomes worrisome.  I hope there's some sort of pay-off here that would justify the chaotic storytelling.     Mushishi is so good at building human relationships and drama in just 20 minutes.   I hope this convinces Sunrise to make another season of Gintama.   Better hops than VC but VC throws it down with more authority.   Holy crap that episode must have been expensive. The animation, background and character detail, and the lighting/shadowing were all on point. The slow-mo stuff also looked smooth and that means more frames of animation which of course is expensive.  That flashback was really really well done. Great editing and timely use of good music. That might be one of the best implementation of flashbacks I've seen in anime.   I think he's like a more evil version of Takamura.   That gave me bit of Kiki's Delivery Service vibe. A magical country girl unfamiliar with the city environment.   Too much going on for a first episode and a bit overwhelming.  Laying out a bunch of story elements in the first episode is a neat idea though.   That hand to hand combat looked good. Nice choreography.   Brewers have a really nice ballpark and a very fan friendly atmosphere and amenities. Also people like to go out in the Spring/Summer and baseball can be seen as a leisurely outdoor pastime. Keeping those in mind, with the right marketing you can get people to show up at the ballpark for a mediocre team.   Well, that was quick.   A relaxing episode about sake. A nice way to reintroduce the show before delving into the bitter-sweet stories.  I also liked how this episode adds to the mushi mythos.   /r/anime has been doing seasonal polls since Fall 2012, I think. Here's the [Fall 2013 Poll.](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/1uxekm/ranime_aoty_2013_aots_fall_2013_poll_results/)  Or you can use [ANN's custom search](http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/search/genre). Just type in the start date and end date for the season then it will give you the results in ranking order based on user ratings.    JJ is hitting his peak at the right time. I hope he keeps it up going into the playoffs.  *waits for Hawks fans to mock me*   Sounds like Bargs.   Should have kept the scarf.   She's a Nudist [](/s "in her titan form.")   Not enough material for another season. Mangaka is too busy drawing fanarts.   I saw it coming but still...Ichihime! Noooo!   Read the first post of that thread. Or you can read the article I posted.  Japanese animation sales rose 6.5% to 78.99 billion yen (about US$768.4 million) in 2013 to its highest total in six years. Sales of foreign animation for the general public and children were 6.191 billion yen (US$60.2 million), and foreign and domestic animation sales combined were 85.17 billion yen (US$828.5 million).    Hahahaha, nice joke. Wait, you weren't joking? http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/215aip/anime_business_industry_data_2013/  That's only for movies.        That fight gave me the chills. Amazing arc from the beginning to the end.   [Chihaya Ayase](http://25.media.tumblr.com/ebb21b7d496248fa5678ffb5e5d867b9/tumblr_mh9ws5uy8x1r4xneto4_500.gif) from Chihayafuru   Spring and Summer seasons always get the good stuff.   What a scare. Should've tried harder to deny Monta from getting the ball.   Livingston got away with a lot of grabbing and pulling there.   Damn Caesar is OP.   The manga sales are excellent so the Japanese do like this type of story. It's just not the type of series that garners fandom and get people to buy blurays and merchandise.  Also this is late night anime so ratings don't matter.       I was half expecting to see the Gintama spoof of who wants to be a millionaire.   And it's mostly fairly well known animes. These lists would be more interesting if they're recommending niche shows like Otana Joshi, Flag, Beast Player Erin and etc.   This arc has been amazing.  Ippo and Silver Spoon have been providing some quality writing and character drama for the past few weeks.   Personally I found Courtesan of a Nation to be the best arc.   I love how you left out the fact that prior to the takedown Hendricks was landing consecutive punches and kicks on a gassed out and hurt Lawler.   The intro to the this episode was great. A prime example of how this show can seamlessly transition from serious moments to comedic ones.  The writing, pacing and character progression have been superb. The dialogue and the way characters react are believable and genuinely heartfelt. This is one of the few shows that handle emotional moments in a natural and sincere way, right along with shows like Mushishi, Cross Game, Natsume and a few others.      All of a sudden this show turns into a psychological thriller. I think the second half has handled the transition between tonal shifts a lot better than the first half.      This felt good after the way the Nets lost to Raps in the last game.   Blatche with some horrendous defense.   Lowry is really pushing his luck with the refs. Surprisingly they have been patient with him.   Ugh, I was really hoping it wouldn't do the "beat some sense into him" cliche. That was just bad writing because Ignacio barely exists as a character and all of a sudden he's playing a significant role in the MC's life this late in the season. It also robbed us of a possible good interaction between Kal and Ariel since it really should've been Ariel talking some sense into him. Really, the best thing this anime has going for it is the relationship between Ariel and Kal, and in a very important moment it decided to go away from it.  Pretty disappointed with this show since I really, really liked The Princess and the Pilot.   I find myself sometimes saying "Oy, Oy, Oy" like Gintoki does.   Nobunaga you spectacular bastard. I love the over the top confidence, the hubris and the grandiose. It's such a nice change of pace from other MCs.    This episode made me want a serious period drama anime.   Nets broadcast team can be hilarious at times.   I want to see how an Ian Eagle and JVG duo would work out.   But damn, you can't just end it in the middle of a **well deserved ass whoopin.**  I dunno about that, the guy just found out the girl he loves is partly responsible for his parents' death. His emotional response is completely understandable. If this goes the "beat some sense into him" route then it would be some pretty bad writing.    [Anime equivalent of Jurassic Bark](http://vimeo.com/38013872).   Best battle so far in terms of animation. Plus Caesar got his comeuppance.   Aww at the group hug in the end.   We're the Three Best Friends  That Anyone Could Have   We're the Three Best Friends  That Anyone Could Have      Haha perfect ending with the old man smacking everyone with his cane.   Shiroe: The Playa in Glasses   AMEN!   Nodame delves into music and a musician's life a lot more than Sakamichi no Apollon.   Oh man, I love Nodame. Great Romcom.   I love that little bit of introspection by Hachiken about running away might have been a good thing but it doesn't mean the problem just disappears.  Also for anyone who enjoyed the baseball part, I recommend that you go watch **Cross Game!**   This might be my favorite fight in the series. I really like how it emotionally escalates right along with the intensity of the fight.         This show is making me realize how uncreative I was during my toy playing days.      Even though Yukine is being a little brat, I still feel bad for him. It doesn't exactly help that Yato is as personable and empathetic as a cardboard box, and is not being a good friend/parental figure to Yukine.  After a few episodes that made me want to smack Yukine, this episode actually made me sympathize or at the very least empathize with him. Also you're right about Yato, despite his good intentions of wanting to reform Yukine and not give up on him, he really hasn't handled the situation gracefully.   Yukine seems to have some abandonment issues. Nora showing up and making Yukine think Yato could leave him for her seems to be the catalyst to this whole mess.  Yato knows this and doesn't want to give up on him maybe for atonement, or maybe out of compassion.   I like Eagle. I found myself rooting for him.  That cliff hanger though.   He should hire a PR person.   Space Battleship Yamato 2199 and Garden of Words. Both are excellent.   Space Battleship Yamato 2199. It's an excellent space opera not just for an anime but across other mediums. Also, IMO the far and away best anime in 2013.  Go watch it!   Those are too long to be considered pixie.  Pixie is more like [this](http://i.imgur.com/nSX0FIm.jpg?1).   I'm a fan of bob cuts too.  A few more:  http://i.imgur.com/8RVs2Fc.png  http://i.imgur.com/wlmDHsD.png   Damn, shit just got real serious all of a sudden. I approached this as a "turn my brain off and just enjoy" anime but this episode is making me think otherwise.   Robot Family is hilarious, best episode so far.   That was kind of a lame fight, no tension whatsoever. I understand it's a set up episode but a whole episode about a dominant win is boring.   That Mari and Mizuki argument is really well written and acted. The dialogue genuinely expressed anger and frustration...then we see Moe wearing a paper bag and then yuri. Haha, only this show can troll you like that.      The goofiness of this episode reminded a bit of Gintama, especially the [manboarding bit](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAqo1mNq15A). I didn't mind it at all and thought it was amusing until the exposition dump, which came off as forced and felt like last minute story telling.   There's been too many flashbacks, the show might have just as well started from the very beginning then just do a time skip. I think the pacing would've been better that way but obviously that would eliminate the twist.  Those aerial scenes looked good, pretty obvious that's where a lot of the budget is going.   Caesar is a big believer in ~~love~~ kidnap at first sight.   I've read that the American companies were overpaying for licenses with total disregard for quality but hearing some of those titles really put things in perspective on how crazy the bubble got.   Eleki Battery is so not a common Filipino name lol.   I wonder if the BD is going to have a less censored version of the bath scene just like Monogatari did...you know for science.   The Japanese aren't big time purchasers of DVD/BDs so it makes sense to maximize price in a limited market.   This [ANN article](http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/feature/2012-03-07) explains it better:  The High Prices... Explained!  To a Westerner, the Japanese DVD market seems horribly overpriced. With the average disc running over 7,000 (US$92) and only containing 2-4 episodes of a series, the cost of collecting a single show can easily run several hundred dollars -- more than many American fans spend in a single year.   The prices actually stem from a business practice we used to have in America, too: rental pricing. Basically, back in the dawn of the home video business, the industry was constructed in a way where "niche" releases were only meant to sell a few thousand copies, mostly to video rental shops. Prices were high (typically $89.95 in America), but video shops benefited from having a wide and semi-exclusive selection of movies that normal people would never pay for. At those prices, only a few thousand sales could mean over a million dollars of revenue. Initially, video industry people didn't think there was much of a market in selling to collectors.   But the fans proved them wrong. Otaku of all kinds (not just anime fans) started buying the videotapes and laserdiscs, and they bought them at those high prices that were intended just for video stores. There was no reason to lower it. **In fact, there were a few experiments to drop the price to a more affordable amount, but that usually resulted in a slight increase in sales -- not enough to make up for the drop in revenue.**  When you think about it, that makes sense. Most Japanese people live in much smaller homes, and with many more people than their Western counterparts. In most cases, it simply doesn't make sense for Japanese consumers to build a big home media library. Only the hardcore fans of a particular product will usually want to bother owning a tape or DVD, and everyone else relies on rental shops. Media is a specialty market, not a mass-market one, so prices have stayed astronomically high.   The Japanese Otaku's desire to own anime even at high prices had an unexpected effect: as the rest of the economy tanked and video stores stopped buying every new video release, the otaku kept buying pretty much everything that got released. Before long, the few thousand fans that bought anime DVDs were supporting nearly the entire budget of a show. Even as the rest of the Japanese home video industry lowered their prices to varying degrees, anime stayed at the same high price. It's simply the only way most shows can ever make a profit.   Mr. Justice is a spammer.  This show is INSANE, INSANE, INSANE. The whole From Beyond thing being an elaborate hoax doesn't really explain the PM going all super saiyan.   [](/s "I could never bring myself to say it but...Yuichi, I've always...loved you.")  [](/s "***smashes snow bunny***")      I feel the same.   I'm gonna be avoiding Sportcenter tonight, don't wanna see that ending again.  I wanted this win bad not just for the standings but for more momentum heading into the games against OKC and Indiana.   Fuck. Fuck. That fucking hurt. Fuck.   I wonder how much change the Wind Revolution brought. The class divide still seems to be prevalent and the end result was a transfer of power from one blue blood to another.      All of a sudden romcom love triangle. The absurdity is pretty entertaining.   Dat David Eagle ass.   I know how Ookawa-senpai feels.   It's from the 2nd movie.      Grown up Kagura made a comeback in the latest movie but [](/s "with smaller boobs.")      This was in the front page of /r/pics a couple of weeks ago.  I love the fact that love hotel is real.   ~~SZBFC7KN48Y~~  ~~UWSPTDRLF95~~  ~~5F94XBKYRYP~~    Eh? Nothing that has transpired so far made me think that she should die and that's the only way to end things. There's still so many unanswered questions about her role.   Killing off a characters can be cliche also and if not done properly can be seen as a cheap attempt for a tear jerker.      The enemy has some faulty designed mechas lol.  Betrothed to his sister and now to a loli. Also with a cross dressing love interest on the side. Nobunaga is like Araragi with a mecha.   That's a fabulous pose.         The underwear song is pretty catchy. That Satan skit is pretty amusing, it got me with the "please deliver me from paper" line.    Damn, just reading this speculation hit right in the feels.   This show with its roller coaster ride of tonal shifts is playing with my emotions.      The bomber being linked to the teacher/bullying felt tacked on. This episode didn't do as good of a job as the first episode in terms of intertwining different cases together.   Usagi Drop, Honey Clover and Cross Game are all on Hulu.   [In the OP there's a little girl cuddled up with little Kal-el.](http://i.imgur.com/AOmivlF.jpg) Hmmm, I wonder if that's Claire. If that's true and she's also Nina Viento then this might get interesting.    I hope it avoids the imouto route but I guess it fits in with the insanity. Maybe the term "sister" means something else lol.

Late night anime used to be available on cable TV like Sci-fi Channel and Tech-TV/G4 but those channels are niche. Even in those niche channels anime couldn't draw a decent enough audience to be kept on air.  The only anime that hit mainstream are children's shows like Pokemon, Digimon, DBZ and etc. That's back when children's shows in general were popular, when Kid's WB, Fox Kids and afternoon Toonami existed. Those days are long gone.  Non-sitcom animation for adults in general has always been niche. Archer is on a relevant cable network and in its four seasons has never reached 2 million viewers. If an American made animation of that type can't hit mainstream then anime doesn't have much of a chance        Late night anime has always been niche. Obviously there has been a few exceptions like Eva, AoT, Haruhi, Madoka and a few others but for the most part the audience will always be limited due to the time slot.   Ononoki with that posed look.   Yeah, the slice of life stuff is a nice breather or palette cleanser in between the intense fights.   That's adorable. I'd watch a show about a girl and her pet alpaca.  This makes me wanna rewatch [Bunny Drop](http://www.hulu.com/bunny-drop).

The humor is kind of dull but I see some potential due to the unique premise. Some comedy shows take some time to pick up steam like Gintama which took me about 3-5 episodes to really get into.  I'll give this the 3 episode treatment and if it improves I might keep watching.   Did the show just referenced Cross Game, because I think it did and it put a smile on my face.

The characters have a good dynamic between them which produced some really funny moments. Then of course, there's also the action and the music. Best premiere so far this season, looks like it's going to be a fun show.

It has the romance in the sky vibe that's a bit reminiscent of Laputa: Castle in the Sky.   The anime is [Anohana](http://www.hulu.com/anohana-the-flower-we-saw-that-day). The location is Chichibu.   man that romance was a little rushed with that "grab her as she falls ,stare into each others eyes and embrance" scene.  Yeah, that escalated way too quickly and came off kind of cheesey. A nice dialogue where they share a few laughs would have suffice in establishing the romance.        Those CG mechs didn't look so good. The show's world building seems fairly interesting though.   I guess that was alright. The animation was great towards the end but the humor fell flat with the exception of the circle joke.   Kino's Journey season 2, please.   I was so happy when I noticed it's a double episode. The show sold Sawamura's bait pretty well.  	150
 All valid questions, you clearly make a better detective than I. I've always suspected Charlotte, quite frankly.   As an urban explorer in general, I've subscribed to this. Thanks!   I've looked and it doesn't look like anything's been scanned  and uploaded online.    You know, I actually researched the Watchmen quote and learned that it originated anonymously long before the Watchmen comics and that the writers, in fact, have no idea where it came from. Very odd stuff.    Happy Cake Day!   If you are ever in Arizona and find yourself on the Interstate-17, pay attention when traveling through a town called Black Canyon City. With a population just over 2,000, and nothing to recommend it to highway travelers but a small gas station, most people will blow right by this little community without a second glance. But if you slow down and look to the West of the highway, you may see a dilapidated, crumbling building with the simple words "DOG (C)RACK" written on the side in faded, orange lettering.    You have found the Black Canyon City Dog Track, the site of one of the worst massacres in Arizona history. The property has remained derelict and neglected since the 80's, slowly rotting away on the hilltop where it was once a thriving den of debauchery.    If you were to exit the highway and park on the corner of Maggie Mine Rd and Coldwater Canyon you could walk to the abandoned building and explore the stale, decaying ruins of a once popular greyhound track.   If you approach the side of the building with the fading orange letters you will see a silver gate standing open. If you venture through you will come to an unlocked door into the building.  If, by chance, you are on the north side of the building, you will instead find a smaller doorway, this one with the door torn off the hinges. Graffiti to the left of this door reads "Why didn't you kill yourself today?"     If you then venture inside, you will find yourself in a cavernous, crumbling lobby. You will find a booth for reservations, a wall of betting windows and even a bar. Beyond that, you can explore the kennels, the private offices of the management, and even the overgrown dog track below.   Of course, one of the first things you'll see are the grandstands; rows and rows of red and yellow plastic seats, many of them still attached, while others have been torn up and thrown in an unceremonious pile nearby. This part of the building has an unsettling feeling as thousands of seats, all eerily expectant, face an empty field of weeds and a small mountain range beyond through large, broken panoramic windows. A large, metal sign hanging above tells you that the red seats cost 50 cents while the yellow seats cost 75.   If you continue to wander, you will find more graffiti such as "Who watches the Watchmen?" and "His name was Robert Paulsen". You will no doubt finish your tour feeling unsettled and ill, and with good reason.   The story of this dog track is mysterious and difficult to find, having been all but erased from history. After doing over a years worth of research, I believe I have learned enough to warrant writing this article.   Our story begins with a citrus farmer named David K. Funk. In 1942, tired of his Phoenix farm, Funk opened a successful race track in Tijuana called "Caliente Race Track", which was the first combination horse/dog track in North America.    It was enormously successful and with his new found wealth, Funk moved his wife and four young children - Albert, Charlotte, Richard and David Jr. - back to Arizona and opened several more thriving greyhound tracks.    The Funk children grew and while Albert and David Jr. followed in the family business, Charlotte and Richard showed little interest and went off on their own paths. Charlotte married a young entrepreneur named Monte Kobey and Richard became a university professor.    David Jr. and Albert moved around the country opening tracks in Florida, Oregon and Colorado. David Sr., impressed by his son's excellent work ethic, named David Jr Vice President of the Arizona race tracks, of which there were five.    David Jr., an aggressive but inexperienced businessman, decided in 1965 to open a new greyhound track in central Arizona. He choose a sleepy, rural town called Black Canyon City, less than an hour north of Phoenix.    When his father wouldn't approve the funds to build this track, David Jr. found funding through a Delaware company called Western Racing Inc., a well known mob-run enterprise on the east coast.   With their help, Black Canyon City Dog Track was opened in 1967, much to the chagrin of the locals, a devoutly religious group, who were horrified to find their pious town host to such a sinful sport.    David Jr. brought his sister and her husband to live in Black Canyon City and oversee the track's management. Charlotte's husband Monte was interested in greyhound racing and so Charlotte found herself once again enslaved to the family business. She noted in her diary that year how much she hated dog racing and how much she resented her family for forcing this life on her.    The track was an enormous success despite local protests and harassment by the town's small police force. Gamblers from Phoenix would drive up on the weekends to get out of the heat and spend time drinking and betting at the greyhound track.   In 1973 David Jr left Arizona to open a new property in Las Vegas, leaving Monte and Charlotte behind to run the Black Canyon track. Charlotte strongly objected to being "abandoned in the middle of nowhere" but Monte was excited about the chance to run the business alone.   David Jr. didn't return to Black Canyon City until early in 1982, when Charlotte called him to complain about the increased tensions between locals and track management. In the years he had been gone, the protests had turned to vandalism, death threats and finally violence after a flaming bag weighted with a brick was thrown through his pregnant sister's window.    Monte and Charlotte argued to shut the track down, citing violence and poor profit margins. David Jr. would not agree to it. He was by this time deeply in debt to Western Racing and they were no longer asking nicely for their money. The threats had grown so violent that David Jr. showed up in Arizona with his humerus broken in three places.   When her brother refused to release the Kobey's from their obligations, Charlotte begged David Jr. permission to leave, telling him about a local man who was harassing her named Brad Davidson. She said she didn't know him and had no idea why, but that he followed her when she was alone and came to the track everyday to try and speak with her. He was an alcoholic and a gambler, she said. In April, a man accosted David Jr. in the street claiming to be Brad Davidson, and pleaded with him for help, claiming he was the real father of Charlotte's baby.   In May of 1982, Monte and David Jr. got into a violent fist fight in the management offices when the latter went through the track's accounting.  David Jr. accused Monte of running the track into the ground due to gross financial mismanagement. David Jr. was so angry that he told Monte about his conversation with Brad Davidson. Monte broke the cast off his brother-in-law's arm.   David Jr. was taken to the hospital to have his arm reset but the local ER staff refused to help him because he was the man who had brought the very devil himself" to their town. Police were called and they escorted David Jr. off hospital property, roughing him up a bit. They told him that crime in their community had gone up ten fold since he had "invited all the sinners" down upon them.   The following month, David Jr. received another convincing threat from Western Racing to ruin him and decided on one last ditch effort to revive the track.  Attendance had dwindled to almost nothing due to patrons being harassed and assaulted by locals as they came and left the dog track.    David Jr. bought adspace in Phoenix and Tucson and advertised the "comeback of the century" for the failing business. On July 10th of that year, all patrons of the track would not only receive $10 in betting credit but also drink for free between 11am and 1pm. Much to Charlotte and Monte's disappointment, the response was overwhelming.   When the day arrived, David Jr. and Monte had to open the track early. Though the races weren't scheduled to begin until 10am, hundreds of people showed up at the track just after 8 in the morning. Phoenix locals had organized their own buses to transport them in mass.    At 9am Monte and the general manager shared an opening-day drink down on the track, which David Jr. declined.   The morning of July 10th, 1982 was a scorcher and the decision to allow people to drink for free quickly became an expensive one. Monte opened the bar early, at 10am and by 10:30 the line for the bar wrapped twice around the lobby.   David Jr., Charlotte and another barman opened two more makeshift  bars  - one next to the outside grandstands and one on the other side of the lobby - to deal with the demand.    Every seat in the inside grandstand was taken and people fought for the outside seats as well. Around 150 people stood mingling around the lobby, watching the races from above and sticking close to the bar. They won money, they lost it, they laughed and cried and drank. By noon, the party was in full swing and everyone was in a boisterous and rollicking good mood.   The first sign something was wrong was around 11:45am when the lines for the bathrooms grew as long as the lines for the bar.    At around 12:20pm people in the lobby started to get sick. Only a handful at first. but within an hour people were vomiting where they stood - this quickly spread to the grandstands.    The general manager of the track, who was stuck behind the reservations desk, informed concerned patrons that it was simply a bad batch of liquor and that it would pass. When several people in the lobby began to seizure, David Jr. closed the betting counter to stop people from asking for their money back.   By 1:30pm, the first person was dead.    He was followed in quick succession by others - death spread like wildfire. Some were found to have dropped dead in the bathrooms, others simply never raised themselves out of their seats and died where they sat and yet others keeled over in the lobby, screaming in pain.     Local emergency services, who had finally been called after the first death, were slow to respond and by 4:30pm 618 people were dead and a thousand more were hospitalized. Tents were set up in the dirt parking lot and medical staff were called in from every town within a 200 mile radius. Of those that were hospitalized, another 381 people died just outside the dog track. The 999 deaths were ruled as poisonings.    David Jr., Charlotte and Monte all survived.    David Jr., the first to cast an accusation, wrote a letter to his father the following day which included a timeline of events on the day of the murders and a paragraph detailing why he couldn't help but be suspicious of his sister. Charlotte had appeared unfazed as so many people died violent deaths next to her bar, and had also gone to considerable lengths to ensure that the man called Brad Davidson was served several free drinks.    Charlotte, in turn, openly accused her husband of the murders, after every bottle of liquor in the building tested positive for Arsenic. She stated that on that day she had twice raised a glass of bourbon to her lips, only to have Monte slap it away. Peculiar, she mused, that he had suddenly become so concerned for her pregnancy when he  never had before. Monte disagreed that this ever occurred.   David Jr., a seasoned drinker, was also suspected of the murders due to his refusal of an opening day drink with his manager, a tradition that David Jr. had always taken part in. In fact, no one had ever seen David Jr. turn down a drink in his life.    Monte, for his part,  quietly accused Western Racing Inc., as he had started to receive threats from the east coast company the week before.    David Sr. wrote in correspondence to a business partner later that year that *he* believed the towns religious zealots had organized the poisonings since they were the only ones to gain from it.    The governor of Arizona at the time ordered a hasty investigation and a purging of all mentions of the tragedy from the local media, thereby ensuring it wouldn't get picked up nationally.   Most of the families of the victims (those gamblers who even had families) were purportedly bought off and the FBI closed the investigation on July 16th. The governor was in the throes of his own scandal at the time (accusations of handing out Indian casino licenses in return for campaign donations) and didn't want  more bad press for his state.   In the end, no charges were filed. The track was closed that day and abandoned until the mid-80's when Albert Funk tried to revive the property as a swap meet venue.  He abandoned this venture two years later after it failed to draw vendors.   David Jr. and his brother-in-law Monte gave up race tracks and opened a successful string of portrait studios throughout the southwest. David Jr died in 2005 and Monte in 2007. Charlotte and Richard are the only Funk children still alive today. No one has ever admitted to the murders.    Perhaps one of the more confusing aspects of this case is the fact that Black Canyon City's well water was also found to be contaminated with high levels of arsenic in 1985. Today, residents of the town and local businesses are served by a private water company due to the toxicity of their ground water.   Sadly, the culprit in this case may never be known due both to the local authorities refusal to investigate the massacre and the federal government's disinterest in it. And even if someone did decide to reopen the 30 year old cold case, most of the evidence has probably decayed and been destroyed by time.   Of course, as you know, Black Canyon City Dog Track still stands today and you can even visit the bar where almost 1,000 people met their deaths.  If you do decide to visit, take your time walking the grounds. You may even stumble on betting tickets with the date "July 10th, 1982" printed on them, as I did the last time I was there.   Even the bar still stands, though it is hidden beneath a pile of detritus. If you do manage to dig it out you may even find an unopened bottle of gin.  But I wont tell you not to drink it. Ive always thought 999 was an unsatisfactory number.

Details on The Cards Against Humanity expansion pack are finally here!  Here is the lowdown, straight from the man Himself!  "Max here, one of the co-creators of Cards Against Humanity.  Cards Against Humanity is a party game for horrible people. It's pretty simple to play: Someone asks a question or fill-in-the-blank phrase from a black card, and then everyone answers with the funniest white card in their hand. Then you just do that over and over until someone flips the table over.  We're big fans of Tabletop, and we want to do our part to help make a new season, so we've agreed to work with them on a limited-edition pack of Cards Against Humanity cards, just for the backers of Tabletop Season Three.  Over the next few months, we'll work with Wil to write 15-card pack of Cards Against Humanity cards, and everyone who backs this project for over $20 will get that pack as a free bonus reward. This pack won't be part of a stretch goal or any other nonsense, it's just our way of saying thank you for supporting one of our favorite things on the internet, and helping some of our favorite people make something amazing.  Thanks for your support, we're really excited to make something cool with you!"   It sounds like this is very possible.   The Kardashians.   Back up off that ledge, friend! As of this morning:  [Tweet](http://imgur.com/Mw8O2Tw)   I'm not a fan of trigger warnings, myself. I actually didn't use them until someone (not a mod) strongly suggested one and then I added it to one of my stories. My stories usually have twists and a trigger warning is hard to add without spoiling it.   It would be nice if the flair just said "Trigger Warning" and then, if you wanted to see it, you could hover over the flair and it would tell you what kind of trigger was tagged.      I think this is relevant but I only write horror on /nosleep. I've been working on a sci-fi/fantasy novel for about 10 months and I'm so absorbed that I eat and sleep in it. Sometimes I write a nosleep story just to "cleanse the palette", so to speak. It's surreal.    Have you gone home yet?   True, I've never heard of a Norwegian ship that big.   Update, OP?    ^ the exception to the rule?    For about a week last year, TVs in my house would randomly turn on. And like, not just the TVs, but the surround sound too.   It only happened at night and it happened in all 3 bedrooms in my house and the living room. But never at the same time.  It was seriously unsettling.    Well that is just NOT true. We cruise a lot and I've been on a couple "re-positioning" cruises, the latest one was LA to Sydney, Australia. And that was on Carnival.    Hold my beer.

There's a reason it has the reputation it has.   Blue eyes.   The scene in Titanic when the steerage passengers and their children are trapped by a gate and the crewman wont open it to let them out. And then later one of the steerage passengers, a young mother resigned to her fate, lays her children down in bed and reads them a story as the ship sinks.  Points for sad historical accurateness.    This is extremely relevant to me right now, as I am on the cusp of quitting my job to pursue my passion. Somebody please answer.   I'm almost certain you can.  Shall we try to summon /u/wil?   Yeah, sorry then I don't know, either!   Ok yeah, so going by the 7 months, definitely not an animal.  But I mean if you want to kill thousands of people never to be found, condemning them to the bottom of the ocean is effective.   As for the actual ships, all I can think is like "here's your personal invitation and ticket to the maiden voyage of _____!" which may or may not actually be carnival/princess/Disney ships.    Actually no. I didn't think there was a minimum though. I'll have to look.   I think it was in one of the updates and he also talked about it during his google hangout.   Here are a couple articles referencing it:  http://ogrecave.com/2014/04/29/tabletop-season-3-campaign-is-dressed-to-impress/  http://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1164614/upcoming-cah-item-via-indiegogo-project    Hippo is amazing.

       ##**Science Verified User Program**  /r/science has a a system of verifying accounts for commenting, enabling trained scientists, doctors and engineers to make credible comments in /r/science . The intent of this program is to enable the general public to distinguish between an educated opinion and a random comment without a background related to the topic.    #**What flair is available?**  All of the standard science disciplines would be represented, matching those in the sidebar. However, to better inform the public, the level of education is displayed in the flair too. For example, a Professor of biology is tagged as such (Professor- Biology), while a graduate student of biology is tagged as "Grad Student-Biology." Nurses would be tagged differently than doctors, etc...  The general format is:  Level of education|Field|Speciality or Subfield (optional)  When applying for a flair, please inform us on what you want it to say.  #**How does one obtain flair?**   First, have a college degree or higher in a field that has flair available. Then send proof to the mods of /r/science .  This can be provided several ways:  1) [Message the mods](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fscience) with information that establishes your claim, this can be a photo of your diploma or course registration, a business card, a verifiable email address, or some other identification. All submissions will be kept in confidence and not released to the public under any circumstances. You can submit an imgur link and then delete it after verification.   Remember, that within the proof, you must tie your account name to the information in the picture.   2) if you aren't comfortable messaging the mods with identifying information, you can directly message any individual mod and supply the information to them. Again, your information will be held in confidence.   3) Send an email with your information to sciencereddit@gmail.com after messaging the mods to inform them of this option. Your email will then be deleted after verification, leaving no record.   This is convenient if you want to take a photo of your identification and email from a smart phone, for example.

 Forget fallible, a person can remember exactly what he said but lie and say he didn't say it. If it's in writing, someone's going to make a much bigger effort in order to prove that they didn't write it or agree to it.   emergence   I assume you mean emergen-c, which is just Vitamin C, which has absolutely no effect on cold or flu. Nor does it keep you healthy, assuming you get adequate Vitamin C from your food.   Tell your wife you should stop wasting your money on it.  endemic   Epidemic.   This seems more appropriate to ask in /r/askhistorians.  Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.

So this doesn't get deleted for being too short.   Because she's the one who sings Let It Go.   Wikipedia:  Evidence of dedications is provided back into the Classical antiquity. Besides the wish to express their gratitude towards a certain person, the authors often had also other reasons to dedicate their work to a particular person. Well into the 18th century, it was not usual for publishers to remunerate the authors; authors tended to be paid or remunerated as one element of a patron-client relationship, in which the author-client paid tribute, in the dedication, to his or her patron. A typical writer dedicated their book to a high standing personality -- to Frsts or bishops -- or to a city and tried to gain some money through this practice.[2]  In many cases the petitioner was lucky and received a gift from the patron. In some cases, the writer groveled before the patron and a formal dedication "contained often a very elaborate and submissive affection".[2] In some cases not only the authors tried to get some money, but also the printers tried through dedications to cover a part of their costs.  The dedication is not to be confounded with the handwritten dedication of a single copy: the presentation copy.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dedication_%28publishing%29#History  I don't think it's essential at all. There are plenty of books that don't have dedications these days. If anything, I'd say author thank-you's have become longer and more popular, where it seems like the author thanks pretty much every person they've ever met.    Definitely. After reading Mr. Mercedes I came away with the impression that King has never actually encountered a black person outside of his imagination.    This just can't be confirmation bias  Of course it can. A sample size of three people that you know proves nothing.  My mother has so far lost probably 100 pounds and she's pretty much exactly the same as she ever was.   Also because Robin Williams committed suicide. If he hadn't, there definitely would have been less hysteria.  (TIL that Robin Williams's middle name was McLaurin.)   I read reviews and I definitely let negative ones put me off books. If I didn't, my to-read list would be 1,000 books long. As it is, there are still books on my list from as far back as 2009 that I still haven't read. You have to find some way to winnow things down.   I don't see any problem here; I do this all the time. The first book is usually the best one, so why bother reading any further?    Where did you hear about this? Googling it turns up nothing.   And this is why I don't consider listening to an audio book as "reading." You're not reading, you're listening to a performance.   I thought it was terrific but you have to have a certain frame of mind to enjoy it. If you're subscribed to /r/atheism, it's probably not for you.   Even though I've read a bunch of her books, I haven't actually liked any of them. They're basically all the same so if you didn't like one, you won't like the others. I never got the impression she was anything like Murakami or that she was trying to be like him.   This is what the Save button is for.    Assuming you're a man: When was the last time you shaved or waxed your chest hair?    Ask her who she's coloring her hair for: herself or for you. If she's coloring it for you, tell her you don't need her to do that and bam, $120 in savings. If she's coloring it for you and you do want her to keep doing it, maybe you are on the hook for paying for it. If she's coloring it for herself, then she definitely needs to pay for it herself.  As for the system, it sounds flawed because your girlfriend doesn't sound like she really wants it to be this way. Sooner or later she's going to try to rope you into to paying for something of "hers" again and you're going to resent it and she's going to resent it when you say no. You need to nail this down. And if she's not totally on board with it, you need to chuck it and come up with another system you can both live with.    My favourite is when the pull the "Well, you're not a parent..." card whenever any conversation about children and behaviour comes up...  If they say, "You're not a parent, so you don't know how hard it is," you can say, "I do know how hard it is. That's why I'm not a parent -- so I don't end up like you. I can't help it if you didn't know how hard it was before you made the decision to have kids."   I'm really surprised there are that many Jews in Seattle that they bother giving off.   I feel even worse since that's two mistakes in one. A misspelling and a hypercorrection   Can I expect it to be as gripping as Mr. Martins series?  No you can't. Turn back now.   At first I thought it sounded really interesting but then I read some reviews that said it was very poorly written, so I decided not to bother.   I'm not a student and I read about the same amount. It's about making time for reading. It's also about prioritizing reading. Instead of going on the Internet or watching a movie, read a book. Read during your commute and during your lunch hour.    You actually did something interesting, unlike OP who did next to no analysis. Most of these graphs are largely uninteresting and unhelpful.  I once did a study of the books that I read and found that they fell into three categories: Books of authors I'd read before, books that I added to my to-read list based on information I'd read in magazines or the Internet, and books that I took from the shelf of the library without knowing anything about them in advance.   I found that I tended to like them in just that order, which lead me to taking books off the shelf much less often since it's much less likely that I'll actually end up liking them. Admittedly it means I might miss something great, but I'm willing to risk it considering my to-read list is around 300 books long.   As others have said, you just had a baby, give yourself a break especially since we're talking about a short amount of time.  But unlike what others have said, too much TV in and of itself is definitely a bad thing. There are a lot more insidiously negative messages than you might realize, it tends to lead kids to prefer passive entertainment, and if they're watching regular TV, they're being exposed to countless commercials telling them to consume, consume, consume.   I've seen 8 of these and only liked 2. Anime tends to be have slow pacing and in a longer format of a movie, they often bore me. That's why I generally prefer anime shows. And even then I've given up on some because they were just too dull.  I liked Read or Die. It wasn't the best ever, but it had an interesting premise that you don't see very often. If you haven't seen it, OP, check it out.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read_or_Die_%28OVA%29   There is nothing great about "anime" any more than there's anything great about "movies" or "television" or "books" or "music." They're animated movies and TV shows and they have just as much variety as any other art form.   What can be cool, though, is that for Americans, Japanese culture, mythology, and sensibilities are foreign and often seem odd, so that can be particularly interesting.   Kite was soul-destroying. Not recommended.   It's a religion and an ethnicity, but not a race since Jews can be of any race.   The current list has been extended to 2016 so they won't give the test again until after that.   I think you need to say exactly what you're thinking and not mince words in an effort to spare his feelings.  "Honey, I love you, but these days you're feeling more like a roommate than a boyfriend. I have sexual needs and it's upsetting that you don't reciprocate. But please, be completely honest with me and tell me your feelings on this subject and let's see how we can work this out together."  If he squirms and won't give up an answer, you need to press him. If he still won't answer, then if you're still interested in the relationship, make an appointment for couples counseling. If he won't go, then you either have to accept him for the way he is or break up with him.    I could see a great animated movie made based on this premise.    This really makes no sense. What sort of "lifestyle change" involves something that makes you a "quitter" if you stop doing it aside from smoking (which isn't a bad thing)?  And it's just generally terrible advice. The longer you live a lie, the harder it is to correct it without making yourself look bad.  https://i.imgflip.com/fwyy5.jpg   This is not an ELI5 question.   Except that Tacitus was born 20 years after Jesus died, so regardless of his motivation, he had no first-hand knowledge of Jesus' existence. While Democritus is referenced by people who were alive at the same time, who actually knew him and his extensive body of work. Jesus didn't leave behind any writings.   I don't think it does, it's just our perception. In other words, you face only changes minimally from year to year but the increments eventually build up to where they're finally noticeable.    It's basically a lazy technique to make a movie longer when they don't have enough plot or a good enough idea for a related subplot. But if it's done well, it can be helpful for developing a character by showing other aspects of their personality that aren't revealed in the main plot.   Imagine an avalanche. Can you tell the snow that it's stepping on you? If you yell for help, will the snow help you? Of course not. And a stampede is the exact same way. This mass of people is now behaving more like a mass of inanimate objects than they're acting like a group of individual human beings.    You don't. You usually feel worst at night because that's when your fever rises.       This is so true. On a recent ELI5 a completely wrong answer got like 10 upvotes because nobody around here has heard the real truth about it.  And the Reddit circle jerk loves certain "facts" that have been debunked or at least severely criticized, such as polyphasic sleep. They keep repeating information about it like it's a solid fact and it ain't.  ETA: Downvotes! Thank you all for proving my point.   Actually, they just planted a bunch in my parents' neighborhood in Brooklyn.   In case you're interested, I got a response: If you have your browser set too big or too small, it automatically switches over to the mobile site, so try playing around with the settings to get back to the old version.   Never knew he was so hot.    It's generally supposed to go by your father's side but there are all kinds of exceptions to the rule, particularly if you were brought up with your mother's customs.    WTF. How on earth does something like this happen?   Heh. And ouch.    The best mother that I know went back to work six weeks after giving birth. She's great, her kids are turning out great.   I don't know any good mothers who stayed home.    you might end up skipping one that you could have really liked and never know. Pretty much just chance and risks.  There are so many books in the world -- you have to make choices somehow.    I bolded my main point. In the end, it's not really about WoT but the fact that I'm tired of reading (or watching) a series and then not have it pay off in the end.   Just regarding the writing, Brandon Sanderson didn't have a good handle on the language of WoT. I felt like he used a lot of anachronisms.  As for the story: There were major character deaths that barely merited more than one sentence.   There was a 900-page battle with this group of people that barely had a single mention in the past 13 books and really had nothing to do with anything. Why was book a 900-page battle? How about a story? With a plot?  And worst of all, Rand's final win against the Dark One had really no impact whatsoever. I read it like three times and I was like, that's it? The same with the breaking of the seals. It was the opposite of epic.    What other methods are there? Storyboarding? It would just take too long and be too difficult to storyboard all movies and TV shows. It also wouldn't allow for flexibility; you hear about so many movies being re-written as they're being shot so that would be a problem.   1. So that nothing falls in by accident.  2. So that when you flush, the misted water doesn't spray all over your bathroom.   Even though studies seem to show that sugar does not make kids hyperactive, most parents will swear that it does. It's not specifically soda, but anything with a lot of sugar in it.   That was a really bad last book. Not as bad as the finale of Lost or the last book of Harry Potter or the last few books of the Dark Tower, but definitely one of the worst endings that I've encountered. Lots of other series that I've heard ended badly I've avoided, and this is why even though I read and liked a Game of Thrones, I'm not reading any more books until I find out that the series ends well. **I will not be suckered by a fantasy series ever again.**  The one thing that WoT has left me with is mild PTSD. Every time I see the word "shifted" in any context, I flinch a little.  ETA: Maybe some spoilers below, but trying to avoid it because I don't know how to use the spoiler tag properly.   Huh and now it's back? It seems to depend on what computer I'm using?  I just e-mailed them to complain.    doing it that way makes the tweet your own (with your avatar), rather than the person you're retweeting.  Exactly. It's the Twitter version of karma whoring.    Yes, sleeping for very long periods of time is definitely correlated with poorer health including increased heart disease and diabetes.    which is the pronounciation that is preserved today in English cognates and loan words from Latin like, faeces, paedophile, and daemon.  Also encyclopaedia.    How exactly do they find the statistic of false rape reports?  Here's a Wiki article that talks about various methods: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_accusation_of_rape  The problem here is that you insist on calling someone who was either proven innocent, or where the case was dropped due to insufficient evidence, a rapist.  Well, as I said before, rape is a difficult crime to prosecute in many cases and it is very rare for a person is shown to be factually innocent, so it is safe to say that the vast majority of cases where a man or woman claims to have been raped, it is most likely to be factually true.  As more and more people are educated about the availability of rape kits and dna tests  Except the problem is that more and more rapists are using condoms in order to avoid DNA tests.  Honestly, I don't know what can be done about all this. I don't like anything people are saying these days about rape prevention. None of it seems remotely helpful. But I'll be damned if I can think of anything better.   You can give them your last name as their middle name. All of them. So if your name is Jane Doe you can name your kids Eleanor D. Smith and Robert D. Smith, the D standing for Doe. It is absolutely traditional to do this. Just look at JFK and RFK. Their mother's maiden name was Rose Fitzgerald; their middle name was Fitzgerald.   You can use his last name in social situations without formally changing your last name, if you'd both agree with that as a compromise. This way you can get Mr.   Mrs. Smith invitations but still have Jane Doe on your credit card or passport or work ID or whatever and nobody in your social circle has to know.   I think you're being overly sensitive or even paranoid. Your own description of your relationship sounds very nice, so the next time someone compliments it, say, "Thank you, you're right, I'm a lucky woman," and that should be the end of that. There's not much for someone to say after you've agreed with them.   It's horrible. Half the features aren't there anymore. Is this just the mobile site? Is there any way of getting back to the old version?   I was looking at the bag and wondering how you knew she was carrying baby heads in there.    They're stupid? They're masochists?  I don't know, when I smell something bad, I do everything I can to try to not smell it anymore.   I don't know why you think this. Zero population growth is usually a disaster for the economy because an economy needs to grow in order to be strong. A stable population means the economy wouldn't be growing, it would be stagnating or even shrinking.   It's because society teaches men to have large but fragile egos, and their self-worth largely rests on their ability to get a good job and provide for their families. So when their spouse is richer/smarter/more successful than them it's a blow to their ego and their self-worth.   Maybe bin Laden wasn't the best example, but he's what popped into my head. My point was that if we really had ninjas like Jason Bourne you'd think there would be a lot more dead bad guys.    Is it weird that this made me think of the Thundercats logo?   The check-out woman at the grocery store... No thanks.   Complete fiction. If it weren't, Osama bin Laden wouldn't have been so hard to find and take down.    So, you're telling me that of the 46 that are reported and only 12 are arrested, that the other 34 as well as the 54 that were not reported are definitely rapists?  As I just posted in another thread, the incidence of false rape reports is considered to be from 2-10%. So if you want to say of the 46 reported rapes, 4.6 are false reports, that still leaves 41 reported rapists. And when you include the 56 rapes that aren't reported, which even if you want to reduce that by 10% as well, that's still 3 out of 91 rapists who do jail time.   Rape is a crime that is very hard to prove and it's not helped by the way rape victims are treated by system.   A few things that haven't been mentioned: Kids take their cues from their parents. So in a lot of families, the parents aren't eating healthy, but they try to force their kids to eat healthy. A big thing is to model for your children healthy eating.  Another thing is not to give them unhealthy snacks or meals more than once a week and to reinforce to them that unhealthy foods are a treat that you get on special occasions. I know families that give their kids unhealthy snacks every day or let them have soda with every dinner and then wonder whey their kids don't want to eat their vegetables.  And finally, a lot of parents don't start feeding them normal food when they're very young. But that's when you have to start -- as soon as they are old enough to eat real food. Unfortunately too many parents wait until the kid gets older and by then it's too late -- they're already used to the taste of bland pap.  So to sum: Eat healthy yourself, start the kid young, don't regularly indulge their desire to eat junk.  But if it's already too late and they're already a bad eater, you're basically stuck. There's very little way to undo it short of extravagant bribes, and even that I have found does not work on very picky eaters.   "Seem" is the operative word here. False accusations of rape get a lot of attention, especially on Reddit, but in reality, they are rare, with estimates ranging from 2-10% of all accusations.   Not a thing here contradicts what I said that 97 of 100 rapists don't go to jail. You seem not to understand that just because someone hasn't been convicted of rape doesn't mean he's not a rapist.   the infographic shows that 97% of those convicted never spend a day in jail  No it doesn't. It says that 3 of 5 convicted rapists do jail. What I posted is that 97% of all rapists don't do jail time. That number includes rapists who were not convicted.  The infographic says: of 100 rapes, 54 are not reported. Those rapists don't do jail. Of the 46 that are reported, only 12 rapists are arrested, 9 are prosecuted, 5 are convicted, and 3 do jail. Three of 100 rapists do jail time.   Your link and edit don't contradict that in any way.   You have to be more specific. I'm not looking through four links to try to find what you're referring to.   You've never laughed so hard that you've cried? You're missing out.   Not me.    Microserfs and Jpod, both by Douglas Coupland. They might be a little dated, technology-wise, but they're both excellent.   I read 37 of these, though I know that I tried to read some of them and didn't like them, so didn't finish them, so let's round it off to 45. But come on, Stephen King is 30 years older than me. In 30 years I'll have read more books too.   Only three out of every 100 rapists will ever spend even a single day in prison, according to a new analysis by RAINN of Justice Department data. The other 97 will walk free, facing no consequences for the violent felony they have committed.   While the percentage of rapes reported to police has risen in recent years, a majority  54%  still are not reported, according to the Justice Department. But increasing reporting alone won't solve the problem: only about one out of four reported rapes leads to an arrest, and only about one out of four arrests leads to a felony conviction and incarceration.  https://rainn.org/news-room/97-of-every-100-rapists-receive-no-punishment   No, it never stops until you get really old. You're married, not dead or blind.   It's funny, my married friend has had more crushes since she got married than she ever did before she got married. At least for her, I think it's a stress thing -- a way of diverting her attention away from problems that can't be helped, like, say, a new bad boss at work.    Chewing helps too. Try to swallow something large without chewing it first, you're going to either gag or choke.   Huh?  "Which car is yours?"  "The one with the locked doors."   According to what I linked, Tokyo's density is 11,300, while Osaka is 13,700. I never heard of Warabi and it's not on the table.   According to Wikipedia, it is very dense at 14,000, but it has a low population. All the cities on the table are megacities.   Japan is larger than Italy and nobody thinks of Italy as being a particularly small country. Rome's density is 5,800.   Japan and China are large countries and they still have incredibly dense cities. Europe is not dense at all. Though, Mexico City is twice as dense as Tokyo.  http://www.newgeography.com/content/002808-world-urban-areas-population-and-density-a-2012-update   Anna Karenina.   I recently read the Emily Starr books and I could not believe how insane they were. Subversive, even. I would never give them to a kid to read.   But I agree, Emily starts to get really boring in the last book. Her decision not to go to big city with that woman editor was truly idiotic, and then deciding to marry a man she doesn't love, even worse.   Ilsa was fun. Maybe there's fanfic about her?   At best it's a book packager. At worst it's a self-pub company that's willing to gamble that a few hours worth of superficial editing will net them enough sales to make it worth it.   According to Amazon, it's not being published by a real publisher. I don't know why he thinks it is, so he's not going to be any help.   Generals used to become president all the time. The last president who was a general was Eisenhower and it makes perfect sense. He was a general during the last "good" war. Who'd elect a president who a general during the Vietnam War? Or the recent Middle Eastern conflicts? Not a sterling record to run on.   They aren't. They have their own set of problems. The healthiest thing is to avoid all of them as much as possible.   It's normal -- it makes you feel calm and comforted, vaguely like being in the womb. It's why people with various mental conditions may be helped by wearing a pressure vest.    Completely disagree. While kippah is more likely to be MO than UO, yarmulke cuts across the board.    The Russian Sleep Experiment  That's not a real thing. Nothing about it is true.  http://www.snopes.com/horrors/ghosts/russiansleep.asp   Sleep deprivation almost always leads to weight gain for a few reasons. First, it messes with your body's ability to create ghrelin, which helps regulate hunger, second, you have less energy/willpower to resist foods that you know you shouldn't be eating, and third, depending on what sort of sleep deprivation that you have, for example, if you have late-night insomnia, you may find yourself eating more than you normally do because you're awake more.   Unlike other comments, I don't think it's meant to sound old, I think it's meant to sound foreign. But instead of hiring actual Greeks with actual Greek accents, they just go for Brits who also have the benefit of having more well-known actors and being native English speakers.  And honestly, I'm starting to see the wisdom in this. I watched the first episode of Marco Polo yesterday and the accents were all over the map because the cast was from all over (America, Australia, Italy, England, etc.). It was a little distracting.    It depends what movies you're referring. Seth Rogen movies are funny but they're intentionally not that good. They're just meant to be a silly good time. Or B movies that are meant to be over the top and ridiculous and exploitive.   Are the parents still married? In which case, do they want to get a divorce? Because this is how you get a divorce. A married person doesn't sue his spouse if he doesn't get his way.   It's impossible to say how it would go down. It really depends on a lot of circumstances: there will probably be a psychological evaluation which will have an impact on the ruling, and various state laws will have an influence as well.   I watched the first episode on Amazon and I liked it, so I thought I might read the book it's based on, but the reviews really flummoxed me. On Amazon reviewers are split between loving it and hating it and and on Goodreads most reviews are in the "meh" range. I can't remember the last time I couldn't figure out what to expect from a book based on the reviews.  So, has anybody read it? Any thoughts on what made this book so apparently controversial and divisive?   I'm about a third of the way through. It's boring. And I loved Treasure Island too, as a kid.   They are all flawed. Cuckoo's Calling is the worst of the three. Gone Girl starts strong and ends poorly, while Mr. Mercedes has some weaknesses all the way through but ends pretty well. Pick your poison.    Did you see what I quoted?   But if you don't like that, here are a couple of other sources:  It would appear from Numbers 31:2627 and Deuteronomy 20:1011 that prisoners of war could be, and were, taken into bondage, but it has been contended that no prisoners of war were ever taken into private slavery (Kaufmann, Y., Toledot 1 (1937), 651).  http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Judaism/slavery.html  In Kadmoniot Ha-Halakha, Shmuel Rubinstein (Kovno, 5686) writes (chapter 22): The gemara (Kiddushin 25a) teaches: 'There are twenty-four protruding limbs of a person, for all of which a slave is set free, and these are: the tips of the fingers, toes, ears, nose, penis and breasts... Rabbi says: Also testicles. Ben Azzai says: Also the tongue. The situation of a slave in ancient times was truly awful. He was like an object owned by his master, who was free to do whatever he wanted in order to force the slave to perform hard labor day and night, and to use him for all kinds of perverted purposes. The master could beat his slave mercilessly for any major or minor wrongdoing; he could permanently maim his limbs without fear of any punishment. For any purpose desired by the master, the slave could be blinded. Herodotus writes (4:2) that the Scythians used to blind their captive slaves so that they would work in producing butter. And there were several other such purposes for which slaves would be struck with blindness, TO THE POINT WHERE PUTTING OUT EYES BECAME A SYMBOL OF SLAVERY. Likewise, prisoners taken in war were blinded as a sign of slavery, and this was done particularly to kings and officers of the defeated army, as a sign of revenge and enslavement. For the same reason, Shimshon was blinded by the Philistines (Shoftim 16:21), and this is apparently also the meaning of the words of Nachash the Ammonite to the men of Yavesh Gil'ad: By this condition I will make a covenant with you: if you all put out your right eye (Shmuel I 11:2), as if to say, In order that you will be slaves and prisoners of war to me. For the same reason, King Tzidkiyahu was blinded by Nevukhadnetzar (Melakhim II 28:7), and this is also the meaning of the words of Datan and Aviram to Moshe, Will you put out the eyes of those men? As if to say, Are we considered in your eyes as slaves, prisoners of war, that you will exert your power over us and to do us whatever you wish, to drag us wherever you decide? This arrogance on the part of the enslavers seems to have lasted until much later times, explaining even Herod's blinding of Bava ben Buta (Bava Batra 4a).  http://vbm-torah.org/archive/intparsha70/18-70mishpatim.htm    In fact, the entire concept of a POW is largely a modern development  It's not.   Here's an interesting essay: http://www.academia.edu/3291535/_Rise_Up_and_Kill_Him_First_On_Modern_Attempts_to_Create_a_Jewish_Ethics_of_War_Nova_et_Vetera_10_2012_pp._1183-1213  Goren finds the Talmudic and Mishnaic sources more relevant to moderntimes in their debates regarding issues such as the treatment of prisonersof war and of enemy fatalities:  The ethics of war of any military in the world is demonstrated prima-rily by two categories: (a) the treatment of war prisoners; (b) the treat-ment of enemy fatalities. The contrast between the behaviour of thePeople of Israels army and the other armies at the time, regarding boththese issues, are outlined in the Bible and the Talmud . . . there is clear evidence in the scriptures that the People of Israel treated prisoners of war, including those of foreign armies, mercifully . . . This behaviour was well known among the nations of the world which were neigh-bours of the People of Israel . . .   I think it's very easy to make a case for either side and have it be in line with halacha. Have it be in line with what's considered modern values is a different issue.   Went last year, it's great.

As for torture of an enemy soldier for information, while it is obviously unpleasant, I can't see any reason why it would be different from all the other things we do in warfare when necessary.

I don't believe that halacha addresses this directly and as such, is open to a wide variety of legitimate conclusions on both sides of the issue.

 I wish I could buy a copy of the 3DS version by that time. Doesn't look like that will happen.   My friends can attest to me being an Apple Fanboy. When I hear android, I normally cringe. It's mostly from every android device being different to the point where I hardly even consider them all using a singular OS. (This is different compared to looking at 2 Windows machines and knowing for sure they're windows despite different companies changing the system around in their own way.)  But, to the point of the thread, I've had custom keyboards crash themselves and default to the iOS keyboard. I've also had apps crash from trying to pull up a 3rd party keyboard as I open it from the app switcher. And sometimes, when I tap a box to start typing, whatever 3rd party keyboard I use at the time doesn't show up. And I'm pretty sure the nature of the keyboards and the 3rd party devs have little to do with it and there's only so much they can do to prevent it.  I am very disappointed that it wasn't as smooth or seemless or bug-free as Android users had with 3rd party keyboards.   Then keep it open for a few minutes to let it cool. It's not a problem.   The point is 100 emails detailing a problem sends a message 1000x stronger than one person detailing the problem one time. Scale that to millions of customers submitting feedback about a problem instead of just a few ten thousand.   In this case, the buggy release of iOS 8 has to do with so many things being added under the hood. It was quite the ambitious thing to do to add so many features for an OS that was going to be used across so many devices. What Apple can do now is make sure that iOS 9 isn't about the latest and greatest features but improvements and slimming down of existing features much like Snow-Leopard did for Leopard. If we went straight from iOS 6 to something like iOS 8, then we would have had so much of a flipped up mess of software on the hands of too many angry consumers. At least Apple seems paced while some other companies seem to want to release new products at any given moment to make another buck.   You know, I find it kind of funny that before writing about "declining quality" of Apple's software, they could only write about how new features are coming too slow and how unbearably gated (it's not that gated people) the ecosystem is. Now that it's actually branched out with Macs that work well in Windows environments, iPhones with applications that communicate with each other, and new features are coming faster than ever, people completely back off on writing anything good and rush to write how Mac is still *behind* and *doomed* and *far behind Google or Microsoft*.  Tim Cook is doing his best to try to live up to the name that came before him. Let's face it, I don't think anyone is going to let him have any credit compared to Steve Jobs even if Tim Cook is doing a better and far more progressively paced job.      Really? Cause I just go to "my computer", open up the drive for my iPhone, then drag and drop all of my photos.   At least you can unload your phone's memory onto a computer with the cable that comes with the phone. I'm talking regardless of phone. You can unload most phones right onto a computer if you want. And cloud services are aiming to do that for us so we can delete happily to make room for new files. So why should this be a problem?   After two years, you wouldn't want to update your phone?... At all?   Wouldn't you want to get a new phone at that point instead of just a new battery?   The cycle is already at 3 years.   So if Windows 10 is a few gigabytes larger than Windows 8, should we all sue Microsoft for "shrinking" the storage space on the computers we willingly choose to upgrade?   And in the meantime, they should also be forced to count Gigabytes the same way a computer does, (per 1.024 megabytes, not 1,000 megabytes). Then maybe we can get a 16GB phone with 16GB instead of a 16GB phone that actually only has 14.9 GB of storage space.  That bullshit is absurd.   So I guess we should all sue Microsoft because they're OS takes up so much space that a computer with 500GB of space really only had 485 GB of space.   http://imgur.com/a/ePOJs  Here is where my collection stands. If you'd like to make an offer, I'll hear you out. I'm still in the holiday spirit, so I'm willing to make a good deal since I need to unload on extra cards and pay some bills.   Based on the solid coding MM had from being an improved engine from OOT, There's something to say about how badly it's been chiseled down from four hours to less than two. And who's to say MM won't somehow be just as torn apart as OOT soon?   Meanwhile, in Iraq:  Habib, "We don't have to blow them up. Their cell phones will do it for them!"  Bajejsh, "That's right. Cell phones and gas stations go boom! Thanks Apple Pay"!   Ocarina of Time? Try a bit of Majora's Mask. Pretty much the only things we seem to be unable to figure out is skipping New Wave Bassa Nova and Song of Awakening, or warping straight to the moon.  But, by God does the infinite sword glitch simply break that game. It does that by making Bomb hovering possible. In case anybody doesn't know, bomb hovering is possible in Ocarina of Time and Majora's Mask by the way the sword functions. Link cannot fall or slip off an edge if his sword's hitboxes are active, so infinite sword glitch combined with block an explosion in the air will cause link to hover. You get off the air by back flipping.  This allows for stupidly crazy stuff.   It's Pinkie Pie on a mug. I'm instantly jealous.   imgur.com is one popular option. (Downside, since it's popular, there will be rare moments where images won't load on poor connections. Still, it's the most reliable.)   You don't upload to reddit. You upload to anywhere else then link to it on reddit.   Yep. It will come pre-damaged by water to save you the trouble of waiting for it to break.   Yeah, if I ever had a game with such a redo loud amount of DLC, I'd probably make the mundane DLC 29 cents each. Think about it: way more people will be inclibed to buy it and spend a bit more thinking they're gettibg bang for the buck and it could potentially make a lot more cash than suits/skins that cost 2 to 5 dollars a piece.   I'd like for shooters to stop trying to depict historic wars and for Zombie games to stop trying to imitate the walking dead or the last of us by trying to push sad stories on you.   Technically, the suction on most vacuums don't extend the full width of the base. It's actually about an inch wide at a spot where the tube would supposedly suck it up. The bristles actually end up spitting dirt and grit back out and hiding it under the visible layer of carpet. Plus, the longer the hose, the less powerful the suction. The only Vacuums designed to properly lift dirt and seal it away are those made by Kirby. They're expensive, yes, but even Kirby vacuums that are 5 years or even 15 years old work better than any modern vacuum from any other company.  Turn your vacuum upside down, turn it on, and put tiny pieces of paper in at the edges and everywhere in between. If it doesn't go directly into the hose, it's spit back out. On the floor, it would have split it right back through the carpet. So if you don't have a proper vacuum, you're literally wanking on sand and grit when you wank through your carpets. That's why some home owners replace all the carpet with hard floors. That's why apartments replace the carpets between leases.   This was an awesome read. Girlfriend loved it too. So NZA, where do you think Ness stands now?   Your opponents cards will never go to your grave yard. Likewise, your cards will never go to your opponent's graveyard.   But I'm not better.   I'm just putting it into perspective. I've pretty much ran out of gift ideas for anyone. Truthfully, I suck at gift giving unless I know an explicit item. Otherwise I end up buying a gift card and making a card.   I thought *I* was a good boyfriend, but that definitely tops me getting my girlfriend a Gold N64 (with matching OOT And MM games, matching controller), and a 3DS for her birthday a few years ago.   Of course not for free. If you were going to give them out for free, you would have donated them to some children's home or something. I just know that he loves yugioh, always likes having more cards, lives in Austrailia, and I figured I'd get you in touch with him.   I have a friend who lives in Australia. He'd gladly take those off your hands. PM me maybe.   This is definitely the right sub. I made this sub to be an environment for all questions Yu-Gi-Oh! related in a shame-free environment.   I got my girlfriend a preorder of that the year it was announced. I guess I'm better! Lol. That's great for you. It's a good read. Hope you enjoy.   Five years for me   I downloaded a stage expansion from http://smashboards.com/threads/stage-expansion-template-for-pm-3-5-36-16-and-12-stage-versions.345936/. I have modified it to only adds 3 stages to the end of the second page. There is an unfortunate side-effect of using this template though.  Although the stages are placed very nicely, the information that's supposed to hang to the right of the preview now dobbles to the left. If you need an example, see [this picture](http://i.imgur.com/IEVSEUg.png). The information here has been moved around heavily to accommodate for the extra stages that would take the right half of the screen. However, I don't have any stages there, so I need everything back where it used to be.  I have a theory that this has to do with the common5.pac of Project M. If anyone can help me with this, I can link you to a download of any files that may be the problem.   You *can* edit the original instead of amending it with comments.   Please visit the following address and use the instructions to properly format your post.  http://www.reddit.com/r/YGOFeedback/wiki/submission-index-viii-by-reiden   Okay, so for the basics, this isn't like other fighting games. A button sequence will not trigger any hidden or special moves. There are only A and B and combining A and B with a direction on the joystick. (I seriously which my friends would fucking grasp this concept. They might actually get good.) A attacks are considered jabs, tilts, and smashes. B attacks are considered specials. Also, for A attacks, holding a direction and pressing A afterwards is a different attack from pressing that direction and the A button at the same time. These are tilts and smashes respectfully.  Now that those are out of the way, when playing Ness, you'll want to keep in mind that using an aerial attack while double jumping will cause you to fall unless you are still holding a jump button. (Aerials only refer to A attacks in the air. B attacks in the air and still considered specials.) You can do a lot of cool things with this. So, master this concept. Get used to using it to move around he stage in fancy ways and throwing out fancy looking attacks.  Now, when it comes to recovering, Up and B works as another recover move. With Ness, it is quite different. Up and B throws out a PK Thunder that you must hit yourself with. It will launch Ness in the direction opposite of where he was hit. Master this recovery.   I downloaded a stage expansion from http://smashboards.com/threads/stage-expansion-template-for-pm-3-5-36-16-and-12-stage-versions.345936/. I have modified it to only add 6 stages on the second page. There are some stupid and nasty side-effects of this though.  For one, the stage name and emblem are still placed as if I were using [this](http://i.imgur.com/IEVSEUg.png). I haven't a bloody clue on how to move it or what I'm doing since Brawlbox's previews for the menu look like a jumped mess of crap.  Also, "- Page 1" icon's position doesn't match up for "Page 2 -" icon. The pages don't exactly match up in the first place, but this is extra annoying.  If anyone can help me with this, I can link you to a download of any files that may be the problem.  EDIT: http://www.lakora.us/brawl/ssseditor/ This helped me get a code that made the stage layouts look nicer. But, the name of the stages are still appearing way off (as if it had to make room for a dozen stages to the right of the preview).   BULLSHIT   Hey everyone. Yes, you. The one bitching about how Patrick Hoban aparently doesn't know anything. I just wanted us all to remember something.  **Patrick Hoban** is at the top of the tournaments. And **we aren't**.   Yet, he's the guy winning tournaments, and we aren't.   The point rather wasn't that the 1,000 LP isn't too far is it isn't too much. What monster are you honestly going to take? Tellarknights wouldn't benefit from anything other than a level 4. BA? Level 3. If you're planning to take a tuner and just sync for whatever, you're going to need a varied extra deck to take advantage of the multiple levels you might take control of.  In the end, Snatch steel is still one card from your hand. If your opponent MSTs it, then it's a 1 for 1. If you take your opponent's monster and tribute it, it's a 1 for 1. Stronger duelists don't settle for something that not only requires set-up but is a 1 for 1 at its strongest. If you could get YOUR OWN monster on the field for virtually free (ala graveyard effect or effect of a monster on field, whatever it is) then you've pretty much got something better than snatch steel. In that set-up, not only have you put a monster there, but an MST isn't an out to it in most cases. Furthermore, it will be your monster whose effect you can take advantage of.  In a format where Snatch Steel is in your main deck, you better hope your opponent's monsters have generic ignition effects that you can take advantage of to turn Snatch Steel into more than a 1 for 1. Hoban pretty much has it right. No deck should be relying on Snatch Steel as an explosive strategy. Especially in a format where the monsters vary greatly in level. Not to mention, when you take your opponent's monster and put it in the graveyard, you better consider the potential downside you could be giving your opponent. You'd be taking something worse than a 1 for 1 if you took a Burning Abyss monster and tributed it for something. Even if you Xyz with it, later, it *will* hit the graveyard and boost your opponent's position.  So quite honestly, this isn't a "make me win" card. It's a "win slightly more" card in some matchups and a "definite side-out" in other match-ups. A card like that won't be in a high-level player's main deck. And I'm calling right now that running Snatch Steel at all for tournaments is going to be the minority. (And no, I don't mean local tournaments where everyone will ride whatever hype train Yu-Gi-Oh! is on. Significant tournaments.)   You're missing a line. Between Historical and current, you should have a line saying:   Previous Thread: +12/-0   My custom build will have to come in January. I'm adding 6 stages and replacing shadow Moses with a more awesome P:M-ified version.   _ oink _    Please put each section on a new line.

Prime 2 must have been a real problem, then.   OH MY GOD, YES!  Except if it goes the Dead Space route. Nothing is further from horror than nonstop action with monsters that practically beg for screen time.   You would get Zero's effect after the summon goes through. Nothing interrupts a synchro summon, and a synchro summon does not start a chain.    Of that move would send you straight toward the corner of two blast zones, then DI would actually risk getting closer to the blast zones. That is when you don't want to DI. A 45 degree angle may not be best if you're on the left edge of a stage being hit toward the right. Your path is more toward a ceiling than toward a corner, so slightly down may be better than no DI.    Some people do to make sure it's a good read.    May not be creepy for you. But don't ruin it for other people. Most of what I've been reading are the cliches along the lines of 'person ended up being a murderer' or 'narrator is actually dead' or 'narrator is the murderer' (that one's the worst).   I think it started out as a minor kink. At night, I would set up a camera and record my wife, Kaley, and I as we slept. When I went to watch it, it would be in short segments. There were times I would find something unusual happening. For example, if she starts blatantly hogging the blanket, I'll rewind and watch it without fast-forward. She knows I do it too. She will even watch with me sometimes.  I don't do anything inappropriate to it. There is no purpose of sexual arousal during any of this. It's just something I like to do. I can't say the same for her, though. I don't usually keep track of what she does 24/7. So let me tell you about some of the funny things I have seen. Don't worry, she and I have both watched all of these parts and agreed to share these.  One time, I rolled right off the bed. But her, being my good loving wife actually picked me up and put me back on the bed. If she wasn't such a light sleeper, I would have woken up on the floor. And we wouldn't have heard me snore on tape. Apparently, I snore sometimes.  Other times, I talk in my sleep. She told me to go over a certain point while watching one night. If only she hadn't heard it. I said stupid phrases like, "I am a cowboy. You better listen to the law." On second thought, I think the stupidest phrase I said all night was, "Bring the fairies in for questioning about the bite of '87." I don't even know what that was talking about.  There was a night when we thought we heard her moaning. Turns out, she was having a dream that night about being with a celebrity. His name was something like Ryan Hanger or something. It was some guitarist she saw on comedy central a long time ago. She wasn't touching herself or anything, but she was making noises. I'm surprised she didn't wake me up.  So talk about wet dreams, there actually was a night when my wife asked me about why I got up in the middle of the night. I had to use the restroom. I did take my sweet time in there. What? I was having a nice long sit. She told me that I must have some talent to get in and out of bed without waking her up. That particular taping began to degrade the resolution.  I always tape over the same video tape. When it gets worn out, I take the tape, burn it in a fire, go down to the basement to get a fresh tape, and put the tape back in the camera. Once I make sure the recording works fine, I leave the camera in position on my dresser next to Kaley's death certificate.   That's a question for /r/yugioheconomy   Why was he looking forward to spamming limiter removal?   **Super-Polymerization**: Banned  I didn't know this card was such a problem. In fact, I've hardly been paying too much attention to Shadoll decks since Burning Abyss have been the top dogs for this format. Not sure if this was actually necessary for current meta or thought to be necessary for future meta.  **Artifact Morltach**: Limited  I feel as though this is completely unjustified. Even if most of my losses have been against Moraltach lately. It just doesn't seem that significant since the engine makes certain back decks better, but it also just makes good decks worse.  **Dark Strike Fighter**: Limited  Supposedly came back because it has new text. So be it, never knew why it was banned. Don't really care.  **Snatch Steel**: Limited  I'm going to have fun with this. I stopped playing when Snatch Steel was still legal and Upperdeck was supposedly still involved in Yugioh. Came back during Macro Rabbit format, and finding it banned was a shock. But I could understand why. But now that it may not exactly be a significant threat, I'm going to have serious fun with it. And so will monarch decks. Just saying.  **Honest**: Semi-Limited  My girlfriend, /u/lily247, freaked. She plays agents and any other LIGHT deck she possibly can. Damage step domination is supposedly not going to play as significant a role as it did in previous formats.  **Goyo Guardian**: Semi-limited  Oh god no. This shit is just stupid. When a fucking noob deck won because of a combination of your own misplay and their reliance on this piece of shit, the game gets more annoying than I care to handle.  **Dark Hole**: Semi-Limited  I'm going to have fun with this. I play Fire Kings from time to time. Not to mention, Burning Abyss can use it to clear opponent's filed and get some searches. Qliphorts can just pendulum themselves back, so I'm gonna have fun with that too. Although, this card will probably be mained at 1 with 1 more in the side.  **NO LONGER ON THE LIST**  * Blackwing - Gale the Whirlwhind  A costless self-summoner that gives you a synchro monster and depletes the power of one of your monster. Who the fuck thought this was a good idea? Brace yourselves, the blackwing players are coming.  * Mermail Abyssgunde  Meh  * Reborn Tengu  I'll probably test this in Hazy Fists  * Reasoning  By freaking god, I'm going to test this in everything I can.  * The transmigration prophecy  Meh. I really didn't think this card was that good when I read it. Glad it's off the list.  **Footnote**  Skill Drain still didn't get hit. BOO FUCKING HOO. Get over it. It doesn't need a hit. Soul Drain is at 1 because Dimensional Fissure and Macro Cosmos fill the same purpose which puts grave floodgates at 3 total. Skill Drain puts the field floodgate at 3 total (not counting anything specific). So fuck you, Skill Drain doesn't need a hit.  Vanity's couldn't at least come down to 2? I guess we're going to continue seeing tournaments decided by who drew the most Vanity's.   Microsoft apparently wanted the mac versions to be more like the PC versions which I guess is why Word got that horrible ribbon-like toolbar full of things that menus do for you anyway. Not to mention, they are indeed unstable on newer operating system and base-system macs that weren't bought with the bells and whistles.  In the meantime, I would recommend either trying out iWork or the Mac version of OpenOffice. They're very compatible with .doc formats and don't require much relearning of anything.   They will assume you have permission. If you are not selling the sleeves at some sort of profit, you cannot get in trouble.   To us. What cards do you have? Post them on /r/ygosales. I might buy them.    but they are banking on that most people are too invested in the platform to actually take their business to a competing service  Yeah, I doubt one title will ever be worth switching services. So, good on Valve. At least if Valve said it's because of controversy, a few more people might understand (at the sake of thousands more getting mad that controversy was the reason).   I could imagine that for a while, some of that DRM made certain music files unable to be put into iTunes or onto an iPod. I would imagine it's like a site that sells OGG music files trying to sue Apple for iTunes not playing OGG format.   I'll tell you know, it sets yourself apart from most combo videos that don't both to do anything more than choose the worst techno song they can find and mute all of the combos.   That editing. Definitely a lot more creative than a lot of other combo videos I've seen (which just put shitty metal or shitty techno over muted combo vids). Adding in those sound effects when you did really set this apart. Very good watch.   Nope, I never complained about it either. As far as I knew, Apple was trying to make sure you only listened to what you paid for instead of receiving a lot of music files from friends and online sharing sites.   Don't really care for the reason, and not a fan of Hatred. But, it does suck when a game with so much support and desire from preliminary fans is rejected for no apparent reason other than Valve said no.   I would love to get this amiibo, not for me but my girlfriend and her nephew. It would simply make their year. They are basically having to live with two families in the same apartment which gets cramped quick. It isn't fun.   It's hard to feel like we can help you. When you're in danger, you may want to leave out extraneous details. Like "It had rotted *from being in the heat from a metal box*". It had rotted would have sufficed. Also, Nan's personal information was a bit much. It's like you're writing down everything that happens to you because you want us to feel it as vividly as you did.  I feel like this update and the read in general could have been a lot shorter and clearer. With so many details, it's hard to think of any helpful advice.   It would take more room on the cartridge and honestly wouldn't make the game feel much different. In fact, when I listen to how some song sound orchestrated from Zelda Reorchestrated, some of it simply sounds off. Some examples are the mini boss music, deku palace, milk bar, and terminus field.    Of course it will. If I'm a console gamer with a dozen PC gamer friends who all get their games on PC, I'm not about to buy a console that cannot play with my friends online while another consoles around the same price can.  But of course MS doesn't want to push PC's playing with their console. They want to sell both. And they're trying to use Windows 10 to sell Xbox systems. They don't exactly make money on hardware that Windows sells on. Of course, they'd love to sell a PC to every person in the world, but if everyone got a PC AND an Xbox (because exclusives and non-cross play), they'd be even happier.      Time to drop that brand of phone and go with something else.    This is driving advice for any time of year. Not just winter.   I think that's quite wise of Sakurai. By the time they've got everything working smoothly online with Smash 4, there may be enough competitive results to balance the game more easily (if they decide to balance it). The game definitely has some balance issues. Ganondorf, for instance, is simply too slow to be viable in a tournament setting. He might be able to get away with throwing around items in casual play, but other than that, he's simply too slow to do anything against the faster characters like Shiek and Ditty Kong.   I don't run Sphynx. In fact, my current build only runs Peryton and Hydra.   I don't get it. The only results were more pictures of chocolate chip muffins and cookies.   I very much agree with this article. As a P:M build maker (Add-on builder if you want to call it that), I've been thinking of different ways to label the stages so that every TO can potentially use it instead of just a few who agree with my decisions (or possibly none).  Instead of people making builds that label everything "Starter," "Counterpick," and "Banned" with sub-labels of "Singles-only" and "Doubles-only," we could have two labels instead. One of these labels would be "Tournament Approved" which would be stages widely accepted to be suitable for tournament. The other would be "Casual" which would simply be anything that isn't tournament approved.  There's just about no more doubles-only stages. Those stages have been tweaked to be suitable enough for singles and may be stricken more often than not if someone is playing against a campy character anyhow. So the only sub-label needed would be "Singles Only" for those 1 or 2 stages that are simply too small to hold the chaos together.  And having 13 legal starters instead of 7 (like most tournaments) itsn't that much of a change. The polarizing stage choices will be stricken very quickly. Not much thinking. And those of you saying it would make tournaments much longer... NOT IT WON'T. It's just for the first game of every match, and it will not magically make matches last an extra two minutes. Stage striking takes less than 30 seconds between educated players. An extra 20 seconds wouldn't hurt you, and it would likely increase the variety of stages we see played as starters making tournaments more fair AND more fun to watch.   Nope.   Nope.   I guess the rules will have some tweaking. I'm not thinking of allowing any FTK deck.   I was thinking about the many decks that have been called tier 0 or were predicted to be tier 0. I always wondered how these decks would do against each other. So I was thinking of hosting a small online tournament for those decks. Everyone involved would have the choice to run certain decks. Among these would be Dragon Rulers w/ babies, Airblade Turbo, Goat Control, Perfect Circle and a few more.  Special rule: main deck cards would be limited to what was printed while extra deck can use anything out today.  Which decks would you want to see represented in this tournament? How interested would you be in participating?  Edit: Okay, so I'm thinking of rebranding it into a "Full Power" tournament. Choose any deck (sans FTK) that was top in its format and run it with any modern extra deck cards.   Meanwhile, on /r/yugioh101  We're happy to answer any questions there.   Use two monsters to make a 4 material XYZ monster.   Use two monsters to make a 4 material rank 6.   If you want, bring paper and pencil to track life points and write down each change in points and cause of change. (Simple as attack or effect would suffice). You're technically not allowed to take notes on complicated things, so keep things simple.  Also, if you suspect you'll need counters or tokens, have them ready beforehand. A token can be any object other than a Yugioh card (unless it's a token card or a card modified to be a token) as long as you can tell whether the token is in ATK or DEF position. Counters can be any object as well such as pieces of paper or tiny pieces of cardboard or dice placed on the card that keep track of the number of counters.  If you're running tokens that often vary in effect, write down the stats of the token on a piece of extra paper or sleeve it with use dry erase marker so you can change it as necessary. Example would be a racoon deck.  This is pretty basic stuff that most duelists understand if they regularly attend tournaments.  Remember to call a judge if you're unsure about something (tournament matches only). Don't take your opponent's word for it especially if they get mad that you don't believe them. Sometimes they are right and just mad that you don't believe them, but other times, they are wrong and are mad that you don't believe them. But remember, Judges are not there answer questions that start with "can I do this.." or "if I did this, could he do...". Judges are to clarify what is happening, not give advice about what you can/cannot/should/shouldn't do.   It's one of the reasons I play as Bowser from time to time.   When you activate an effect, announce it. I can't believe how many duelists don't understand this. Especially online. You can't just say you're activating an effect. Announce the card whose effect you're activating, which one you're activating, and pay cost BEFORE asking your opponent if they have a response.  If you're entering without a deck that is meant to be competitive in a competitive and complete state, then don't expect to be lucky. I'd advise to just have fun and see how you do and learn from other duelists. It's a learning experience.  Write down the cards you see most often. Specifically, the ones you don't know. If you don't know a ruling for a card, write down the card and ruling and get it confirmed somehow. Writing things down helps retain information, and hopefully, in one day, you'll learn a good portion of the most real-life meta rulings.   Dragon Ravine to 1. Possibly. Not because I want it back, fuck dragunity rulers. But I think it still wouldn't be a problem with Burning Abyss and Qliphorts running around.  ~~Stratos to 1~~ Or not. I really don't fucking care.  ---  Now with the obligatory stuff out of the way. I can get into what I think could happen vs what I think should happen.  **Vanity's Emptiness**  Should go to 1 | Might go to 1 or stay at 3  I think it's rather bullshity that many decks may sometimes just need that one special summon (no more, just one) to get what they need. But this card completely denies it if the opponent doesn't immediately have a mystical space typhoon ready. 5Ds has made its money. Vanity's is still absurdly hard to find, and afterwards buy. It literally defined a format.  **Skill Drain**  Should stay at 3 | Might go to 2 or 1  I really can't say. Even with Skill Drain builds of Qliphorts, Burning Abyss has been handling the hell out of them. Yeah, it still sucks when you don't have an MST and there's none in sight, but let's be honest, how many decks actually main this card? How many of those decks are meta? About 1. And it hurts one of their own monsters. This is where having a deck with graveyard effects or doesn't completely rely on monster effects comes in handy. This is where a grind portion of your deck, a portion that can hold out until you have removal, is important in a format without Heavy Storm.  I really don't want my favorite trap card to be hit.  **Heavy Storm**  Should stay at 0 | Might stay at 0 or go to 1  Why do I say this? Because if Burning Abyss is finally scraped a bit for the sake of promoting new cards, then I don't see how Pendulums can stop being a problem. I think it definitely should stay at 0 since it first and foremost is an OTK enabler. Not only does it enable OTK decks, but entire OTK formats. We have other cards to deal with face-up spells and traps, even multiple ones at a time. It's closed-minded players who see Heavy Storm as the only good way of countering Pendulum decks.  **Wind-up Carrier Zenmaighty**  Should go to 1 | Might stay at 0 or go to 1  Call it by it's real name, people. Please. You're not being clever by calling it "party boat", and newer players are left clueless. Seriously, this card at 1 with the other Wind-up hits might make for just a mediocre troll-deck at best.  **Rekindling**  Should go to 2 | Might stay at 1  I just don't think Rekindling is all that good. The decks that use it right now aren't that good. It not only requires set-up, but banishes anything you don't get rid of which forces you to choose your xyz play immediately. Not to mention cards like Vanity's Emptiness and Solemn Warning are huge right now.  **Torrential Tribute**  Should go to 2 | Might stay at 1  I just think if Pendulums are going to turn into a problem, we should have multiple solutions to reoccurring summons. This wouldn't fix anything, but would certainly help. It would also help Fire King and Chain Beat players a lot. Let's face it, those decks aren't that good.   This shit has been on the front page five times already. Stop up voting blatant reposts.   I suppose Bowser shouldn't shake the screen either.   I got it. You fucking prick. I knew what you meant. I thought the joke was just telling me I should get my wording right. Now fuck off.   10 tellarknights, 10 traps.  Or, failing that, 3 Cyber Dragons, 2 Dyber Dragon Core, 2 Cyber Repair Plant, 2 trap stun, 11 draw cards.   Yeah, I'm pretty sure Aonuma has learned his lesson about large worlds. He's made quite a few, the best in my opinion being The Windwaker. (Wow, have I plugged so many hours into that game with a single file.)  Besides, Skyward Sword's world didn't seem big to me. The loftwing got you from one side to the other in five minutes. As far as exploration goes, I didn't do much because of the lack of incentive to do so. Zelda U, I hope, will increase that incentive if Aonuma does as promised.   I don't see the word "3DS" or even "DS" anywhere in this page.   He's working on Majora's Mask 3D which is more than probably going to influence his decisions and ideas on Zelda U. Especially if Miyamoto has something to say about it.   His wife's children aren't his.   Apparently, they expect you to have been doing work for free for 2 years before getting paid for it. I'm sorry, but isn't practicing my skill while learning it experience enough to get started doing it? Don't you want to be able to mold me and brainwash me instead of having the ideas/ideals of different companies when you hire me?   I've seen this on five fucking memes now. Can we NOT upvote this shit to the front page every time someone posts it?   Seriously, maybe the new puzzles are figuring out HOW to get to where you want to go. A page from the book written by Metroid. Sure, sometimes you know where to go or have a map, but getting from point A to point B may not be as simple as walking the straightest line.   My personal favorite boss from SS was Tentalus. Not so much for gameplay or difficulty, but it was an epic fight started with the epic escape that the boss made necessary. I hope more of that creativity comes into introducing bosses. "Oh, boss door, let's go in, and..." small custscene, boss shows himself off, start boss fight.  Am I right?   This game *is* coming from Aonuma. This is pretty much the guy who brought us a living, breathing, almost sentient-feeling world of Majora's Mask. I'm pretty sure he isn't going to completely screw up in the living breathing world portion of the game.   I got bored of Skyrim after seeing a friend try to show me the "awesome things" about it. He spent 20 minutes in a menu doing almost nothing. I said, "fuck that". No game where you spend more time in a menu than playing is worth it.  Then cue him doing a 20 minute dungeon for the same amount of gold that the loot from a single enemy could give him. Oh, and a potion. Don't forget that 1 potion.   Hard to improve on that. WWHD gyro was pretty damn awesome. Only thing they could really do is have an option to adjust the sensitivity.   That the main quest doesn't make you want to complete it. That side-quests will be more fun, more engaging, and actually be the bigger reason for logging in long hours than the main quest. The big fear that all these side-quests and mini-quests will be nothing but trivial and repetitive leaning no desire to get 100% on the game.  Basically, that's it becomes Skyrim with a Zelda skin.  I really don't think this fear that the world will just be open and bland with no villages, NPCs or things to do in it is justified. They have almost a year to fill this world in. Let's give them a chance to do so before just saying "bland and boring is this world".   The hilarious, yet sad, thing about this is that it happens. My friend, let's call him Dillin, has a wife and 3 kids. None of them are from the same dad, and none of them are his.   Depends on how easy it will be to get a PGLD one and how many people want the PGLD one instead of the original or tin prints.  PGLD Extremely easy to get? A lot of people want it? Other prints could drop 5-6 dollars.  PGLD Very hard to get? Not a lot of people want it? Other prints might drop 1-3 dollars.  PGLD Very hard to get? A lot of people want it? Other prints could drop between 1-6 dollars.  A lot of this depends on who wants it though. If the people who want it are selling their old ones, that could in turn raise the supply of old ones while their demands go down. Lower prices for old prints.   She *could*, but that's not the point.      My family still assumes that I'm as immature as a 6-year old. That started when my girlfriend gave me a rainbow-dash shirt during my first Christmas as a brony. They couldn't believe that I would watch the show. They've never seen it, and have never given it a chance because of their impressions on the previous renditions of the franchise. To make it worse, my eldest brother sees it as *another* reason to call me gay. My mom continues to question my interest and sexuality and taste in shows because my oldest sister watched three minutes of generation 1 and gave up on it.  It's bucking annoying. In my family, you can joke about killing each other, beat each other up, give gag gifts, and even watch extremely violent and/or satanic shows for a laugh. But watch an episode of My Little Pony and everyone starts questioning everything about you.  My girlfriend's family is a lot more accepting it, and every day, I like start to like them more than my own family. Not all of my girlfriend's family doesn't all watch, but they are much more understanding of why we like the show.  I can handle some stranger on the internet or passer-by assuming I masturbate to cattle or horses, but my family simply not giving it a chance or hearing me out on why I like it just makes me wish I had a different family.  I don't necessarily watch The Walking Dead, Game of Thrones, Glee, or Breaking Bad. But my family spans all of those and I at least respect them. I don't call my sister a geek or loser or assume she's a talent-less wannabe for watching Glee, nor do I think my eldest brother is a meth-head or accuse him of being a marijuana junkie for watching Breaking Bad. But I respect what they watch.  I'll be glad once I get my own place, since then I'll finally be surrounded by fellow bronies.  (Wow, I just realized that Bronies act more accepting than my fully Christian family. Seriously, the only family I can think of that hasn't been judgmental about it is my brother-in-law who is a pastor.)   _ PMDT DOESN'T OWE US SHIT _   Because of high rates, not something that would be worth it for either of us.   It's not a quick effects. You can only activate it during your own main phase.  Destroying a spell/trap does not negate the effect of the spell/trap. The only exception is destroying continuous spells and traps which must be on the field to resolve.      Yeah, all 14 ounces.   This is a load of bullshit. Those cops aren't doing their duty. If there's cops to talk to, then obviously, there's SOMEONE free enough to approach a house, knock on a door, and demand a stolen phone back and possibly make arrests for theft and any other illegal activity that household has been up to.  Tell the cops you tried to ask for the phone back but they shot a gun at you. Then they'll have no choice but to investigate. If that doesn't work, tell them you just shot them and got your phone back yourself. That will surely get their attention.  Or, you could keep recording (on video) evidence that they definitely have your stolen iPhone, report it to the news, threaten your city council rep and mayor that you'll vote against them if your tax dollars refuse to protect you from theft, and capture the world's attention if you can. A country or county's cops are a piece of shit if they pick and choose who they help.   I have a Cyber Dragon Deck which I'm taking apart and selling. I really need the money right now as I struggle to find a job and pay college loans.  I'm not leaving the game by any means (I'm using a budget deck right now). I'm moving on to a different deck after Cyber Dragons anyways.  I'll accept reasonable offers on big bundles. I have a few more cards to sell that I will be putting here at a later time.  In the mean time, [Here's a link](http://imgur.com/a/ePOJs) to what's for sale. Just ask about price/rarity.  I'm not trading, nor can I buy right now.   [](/paypal)  **[What's for sale?](http://imgur.com/a/ePOJs)**   My friend got top 8 in his locals with Agents and he was the only one in top 8 not playing Qliphorts. I found that rather mind-blowing.   I just tested this out in Devpro. It actually works. The techs work. The choices work. It all works, and it makes the deck more flexible than most tellarknight decks.   Constellation Kause becomes once per turn.  Satellarknight Deneb cannot search for a Tellarknight monster you control.  Hazy Flame Pillar doesn't allow non-tribute normal summons.  Dante cannot mill more than one.  Mermails changed types around and worded so only discarding for the big summons gets any effects from discarding. (Okay, not so subtle, but would hinder them slow unless they drew just the right hand).   It's a first look. Why would you reveal anything spectacular on a first look? It's a few small parts of the over world. They haven't even scratched the surface. Why the fuck is everyone so skeptical?   I'd rather play this than Skyrim.   Hitting the mark is miles better than $60 beta testing programs and day 1 patches.   I think we should all stop being skeptical. One of the fun parts of Skyward Sword was that environment was turned into a puzzle. This looks like it can bring similar yet more subtle experience. It's taking a part of Metroid's formula of turning the simplicity of point A to Point B into something that you need to figure out. Plus, a world this eerily detailed has the potential to hide the most subtle secrets for small but rewarding returns (unlike Skyrim where you might do a whole dungeon for a small amount of gold and a dirt cheap potion).  Plus, I bet, that this world to turn out just as beautiful if not more beautiful as anything Bethesda has tried to do. And they likely didn't put nearly as much effort into just making sure every object's every last wrinkle can be seen.   "I can get it for five dollars at Franks".   -ultra rare breakthrough skill.  "sorry, it's getting hit for sure,".   -Evils warm Option  "that's not for trade ".   -a card they really should not put in their binder if they are not trading it  "you have any (insert card I have)".   -"oh, I'm sorry, I'm only looking for the ultimate rare"  "yugioh prices is always wrong".   -their other site's prove ends up benefiting me instead of him, so I just let it go.  Just to elaborate, I was willing to value my exciting at 20. Based on yugioh prices. He saw 30 dollars for the same exciton and offered me 25 for it. I took his offer.  Also, please fucking learn how to use Yugioh Prices. It checks everything at once for you. If a value seems unusual, click on the fucking listing and verify it.  	128
 I've been doing a lot of pixel art work the last few weeks for a new project, trying to get back into the style. I love this series by [Nina Geometrieva](https://www.behance.net/gallery/What-Space-Really-Looks-Like/12984019) and did a small 8bit version for practice.

I love [this series by Nina Geometrieva](https://www.behance.net/gallery/What-Space-Really-Looks-Like/12984019) and did a small 8bit version for practice.       I can understand wanting to read all the comments at once like you're used to. From a writing standpoint it's nice because I get to see what part of the writing people are commenting about.   Here is an example from this article. I had a sentence that made no sense and the comment system allowed me to see exactly what the commenter was writing about.  http://imgur.com/z2UOvrR   Yeah, but I'm not a good writer.   I just downloaded a pdf of all the books so I can read them on the kindle sans internet :)   I've been reading everything on here before launch to level up my IMMERSION http://www.imperial-library.info/       It isn't legal but by the time the developer gets a cease and desist from Nintendo they will hopefully have made some money from ads and collected a lot of user data. To comply with the cease and desist they will just change the offending art and the game will keep its users after the update.    That's a wonderful testament to patience, something I am constantly trying to improve.    I agree with qwert in that it would be great to see more contrast, especially at the end where something is illuminating the way forward. It's a well done piece composition wise.   I have this terrifying dream once a year or so still. I graduated high school in 1998 too. When will it end?    This looks like a fun subreddit. How do you request an invite for private subreddits? I hope it is an involved process requiring animal sacrifice.   It sounds like you have already made up your mind to use this opportunity to pursue new work. As you develop more as a designer you'll find that money isn't the only motivator anymore. It's great when you find a place to work that has a great culture and shares the same values as you. Keep that in mind on your job hunt, though I also understand that sometimes it can be so bad that anywhere else is better than where you are :)    This is beautiful.    I think the only rules in advertising are that you can't tell an outright lie. Otherwise advertisers can pump out whatever paying consumers are willing to be influenced by. All religions advertise, some are just better about using the right sort of media to reach an audience.  My assumption, based on no research what-so-ever, is that a large part of football loving american families are christian to some degree. It is probably easier to convince someone who believes in one religion to switch if they are 'losing faith', than it is to convince someone who has no belief system to suddenly get one.   You have opened an entirely new world to me :O   Oh cool thanks I'll check this out.   I think [this tool](https://www.hotdoor.com/cadtools) has an isometric grid but I didn't want to pay several hundred dollars for it.   I've never worked with blends, googling now thanks :)   For more reading on spec work (which is what 99 designs is) http://www.aiga.org/position-spec-work/   I've been working in it for a long time now, but there are some quirks that drive me bonkers. Snapping is a big one. Nothing EVER snaps correctly in illustrator. Whether that is because I am not using settings correctly (enable pixel grid, snap to point, snap to grid, sub snap settings like snap to selection or snap to art board omg) or Illustrator has just had awful snap detection I do not know. I suspect it is just illustrator trying to make me angry.  Regardless of some of the crazy things about Illustrator it really is a powerful piece of software and allows me (and other much more talented artists) to do really neat work.  There are an almost unlimited amount of free tutorials out there on youtube and artists' websites for you to learn. I just recently read Vector Basic Training by Von Glitschka and it was excellent. It has a lot of basic stuff in it and he does a good job of explaining how and why he does certain things.   I use so many keys I actually got a 2nd bluetooth keyboard that I use on [top of my wacoms](http://instagram.com/p/ZWDCftlPBs).  I had a medium intuos I just recently sold because I found I was using my small one (in addition to the cintiq) and never the medium one. I had bought the small one at first to work while traveling and found that it was really all I needed. I think I may tend to draw small anyway in my moleskines though, so it really is a preference thing I think.  The nice thing about most retailers now is they take returns on hardware for at least 7 days, and in some cases (like amazon) up to a month after purchase. Try one out and if you don't like it swap it for a different one.   I've had great luck from americasprinter throughout the years. If you want high quality (higher cost) papers and letterpress check out dolcepress.com   This is good advice. Go out into the real world to conventions, meetups etc. You will make valuable connections who will have advice and possibly work for you. Social networking is great but it still doesn't compare to meatspace networking.   Wacom recently rebranded the bamboo to intuos, and the intuos to intuos pro. When the bamboo first came out it had driver issues and was very unresponsive and I couldn't recommend it to anyone. I have not tried the newer versions but they may be much better. If you have less than $100 you may want to try one of those. Maybe get one on amazon and if you don't like it send it back.  If you have $250 to spend the small intuos pro is amazing. I have a 24" cintiq touch I use every day and I still use my small intuos pro several times a week. The intuos is super responsive and has almost no lag (compared to my cintiq which has some lag when I'm doing quick sketches.) If my intuos were to break I would immediately get another one.   Every couple of months I find a unique style in something that catches my eye, whether it's a form of illustration, design style, painting style etc, and I copy the style incorporating my own content into it. I don't ever do it for clients or for money, it is mostly just to learn and practice something new (or something I haven't done in a while.)  An example right now is isometric pixel art. I actually have a client that wants this form of illustration for a project, and I have done it before, but I'm out of practice. Right now I plan on doing a few illustrations just for personal practice before jumping fully into the project.  I like browsing behance and dribbble for styles that I have no clue how to do, and I try to copy it as closely as possible. After I feel like I have a better understanding of the style I then try to make my own content in the same style.  It's not really a design challenge that other people ever see, it's more just for myself, but it works well for me :)      [Sharpie](http://www.amazon.com/Sharpie-Fine-Point-Black-1742661/dp/B001CS1QC0/ref=sr_1_13?ie=UTF8 qid=1391271060 sr=8-13 keywords=sharpie+fine+point) fine point for pens  [Rotring](http://www.rotring.com/en/) mechanical pencils - I like the weight to them  [Black Pearl](http://www.amazon.com/Sanford-PAP1742567-ERASER-BLACK-PEARL/dp/B002VCNJ4Y/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8 qid=1391271196 sr=8-3 keywords=black+pearl+eraser) erasers   When my wife had our new baby the hospital we used had a birthing center there, so if something did go wrong it was a room away from doctors with lots of equipment and tools. We didn't look into any other birthing centers so I'm not sure how many of them differ or if they aren't part of a hospital.      I've never seen your stuff before. I really like it all :) How do you make time to do comics if you have a kid though :(   I actually came here to post that line:  "2. We shouldve noticed that the photo used in the blog wasnt up to par. It just wasnt a good shot, and there are about 5,000 others wouldve been better suited for the post. "  Sounds like someone is upset they got caught stealing an artists work. If I did have any sympathy for the blog who is making ad money on articles using parts of other peoples work, it vanished at that point.   You won't be living out of your car if you don't focus on interaction, though it would probably make you more marketable. There are a lot of companies that still need good print designers (I just finished up a contract for a large trade show company) and the work is fun and rewarding. When I have tough decisions like this to make I tend to lean toward the one that I would enjoy more and it has served me well in life.  	36
 Crime Scene Investigation North Unit  N.J.S.P. Troop B Headquarters, Totowa, NJ  Memorandum of Record   nbsp;  To:  Willard Barfall, Chief of Police  From:  Sgt. Patrick Michelson,   Night Shift Downtown Unit Supervisor  Cc:  Police Command Staff  Date:  October 2nd, 2014  Re:  Evidence Needed   nbsp;  Hey, Will. Sorry for taking forever to get back to you, I was searching the evidence room for the journal. Again. Its been gone for weeks though, and I doubt well find it in this  building. The tapes still dont show anyone leaving the room with any object that hasnt already been accounted for.   I still have the online copy Mary made, though, so itll have to suffice. Not sure why you need it right now, but Im sure youll tell me later. Are we still down for Saturday? You havent replied yet and Amys getting on my ass.   Anyway, have a good night. Call me later.   nbsp;  File attached: 115344.doc (0.07 MB)   **View**    *September 21st, 2013*  If you find this, please dont try to figure out where I am. Take this and run. Destroy it if you make it home alive. Make sure no one ever knows of our legacy.  I know now that there is no god, but for gods sake, burn any trace you can.  All you need to know is that this is our birthright. This is humanitys womb and bones.   nbsp;  *September 14th, 2013*  We have to find a way out. There has to be an end. We could always see either side, but we never got any closer. Not until last night.  We stuck with one direction, and for the first time, I think were actually making progress. I think were getting closer to the other side.  Well spent one more night in this forsaken tunnel, but after that, well be free. I know we will.   nbsp;  *September 12th, 2013*  We cant get out. It doesnt make sense. We spent three days walking back and forth in the tunnel. It doesnt matter which side we go to - the exit only becomes farther and farther. Three days spent walking until the blood in our shoes made it nearly impossible, screaming until our ears rang for hours, sobbing until there was nothing left. Three days worth of stomping on that picture, over and over again, trying to deny its existence. It was only a short time ago that she finally ripped it apart. Now, we dont have to think about it anymore. Now, there is only the future.  The horrible, agonizing, unending future.   nbsp;  *September 10th, 2013*  There was a picture in the middle of the tunnel  It was [scratched out, unintelligible]  Who couldve taken that picture?? WHO  I can feel its eyes   nbsp;  *September 9th, 2013*  For the first time in days, maybe weeks, I feel hope. We found the tunnel! We have to be getting closer now. I still dont see the road, and the area around the tunnel is just more trees, more forest, but thats okay. She said we might be able to find the road on the other side of the tunnel. I know there was a parking lot nearby that side. It cant be much farther now.  Now that Ive got a grasp of hope, Im not letting it go.    nbsp;  *September 8th, 2013*  I cant let that happen again. No. I was so scared and mad, and for what? Not like it did us any good. We probably became even more lost thanks to our hysterics. But I think Ive got control of myself now. The actual time part of my watch is broken - its stuck on 8:27 AM - but the date continues to work, so I know how many days have passed. Its easy to lose count of the sunrises and sunsets.   We have nothing. They kept everything when they let us go. Our camp gear, our individual possessions, everything has been taken. I hid this book in a safe spot, out in the woods, and it was still there when we were released.  Weve been hiding. I know they told us we could only leave if they couldnt find us, but I dont know if they really meant it. We cant hike forever.   I write whenever we take breaks. I write instead of sleeping a lot of the time. I found that two hours is just enough rest to keep me sane.  She doesnt say much of anything anymore. Only what she needs to say. I only see her cry when she stares into the fire. I dont know if she knows I can see.  We have to make it out.   nbsp;  [Undated Entry]  They said theyd let us go. They said! Theyd let! Us GO! And here we are, circling and circling these damn woods. These damn goddamn fucking WOODS! CIRCLING AND CIRCLING AND CIRCLING AND  I hateyou! You said youd let us go! Why the fuck did you L I E? How could you? I know youre hiding us, and I know youre hiding!   nbsp;  *September 4th, 2013*  Were getting deeper. We found a craggily rock that looked over the tiny creek and sat there for a while. It was starting to get dark, but it felt like the sun was doing us a favor, stretching out its light for as long as it could. It was 7:05 PM but still just a bit past sunset. We really shouldve been setting up camp while it was still light, but we procrastinated, just talking. I dont know why; there isnt much we dont already know about each other. We werent saying anything important, just blabbering about various nature facts and some funny things that happened to us weeks ago. I keep getting the impression that shes trying to put off saying something.  I wonder if shes afraid well die. I mean, obviously she was, but I wonder if that feeling is still there. I want to curl into her fear and make myself at home. Her fear would comfort me, because it meant that she still loves me. Loves herself.   nbsp;  *September 3rd, 2013: Part 2*  Were here now. Weve been making various signs and symbols for ourselves so we can find our way back more easily. Its mostly just killing time until we actually go into the forest.   Im going to try to write as we go. Our phones still just barely work, so I need this to keep me from going insane. Im not going to go crazy.  I know this is a terrible idea, but I dont know what else we couldve done. We just want the nightmares to end.  Heading out.   nbsp;  *September 3rd, 2013*  Were going. Theres no doubt about it.  She woke up screaming my name. I tried to comfort her, which turned into her comforting me. We sat in bed, clutching each other, crying and trying to not look around the room. Every light that still worked in the apartment was turned on, but we never left the bed. After a while we thought we heard the sound of a metal screen door opening and closing. We dont have one.  The morning after she said we didnt have a choice. We need to go. We need to figure out why this thing wont let us go. We need to see what it wants us to see. I was too tired to argue, and didnt speak up until after she threatened to go without me.  I dont want her to leave me here.  Were planning on spending at least one night out there. Its already half passed three and I know we wont have enough daylight. Still, shes packing like were going to be gone for weeks. I keep asking her Why pack this? Why pack that? hoping shell admit to something, but she always replies, Just in case.   Ive been hiding in the bathroom to cry, but were still sticking to our rules and never let either of us be alone for more than two minutes and forty-two seconds. I dont want her to know how afraid I truly am.  I started a different journal, just in case. I burned the old one, just in case. Now Ill never have to see it looking at me through my dotted Is again.   Weve got the last of our gear. Time to go.   nbsp;  [LANGISEHTROFTIAW](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/3dnc2l/wellspring/)  	1
 Is that a... Is that a flip phone?   I always wonder do people just take these pictures from some girls Facebook and post them.   I lost my shit when I got to  the "lollirock" part, my god.   I was in year 4 (about 7) I asked the teacher if I could go to the bathroom he said wait till after class, I asked again I told him I needed it really bad he said no, so what did I do, I fucking pissed my pants sitting on the floor, most embarrassing thing that's ever happened to me, fuck you Mr. Bennett.   If you have a ps3 you don't need ps plus to play online, only for ps4. Just to clarify.   Maybe you need a dog tag with a head on it or something to activate it? Lots of dog tags with heads on so i don't know.   I'm in love with the first painting, I love both the space theme and the little steam punk vibe at the bottom, any idea what the inspiration for that piece was?   Bushmaster ahahahhahah   "Manufacturer BAE Systems AB" ha ha ha "bae" ...   Spam urgh, I'll just die, a life of spam is hardly a life at all.   I want to slap this child in the face.   Are those the cats from that Crusher milkshake advert, I miss those guys.   Just wait around a while it has a short cool down between activations not sure on the exact time.   What was there before the universe?   Liquid sex   I'm gonna keep using the unica 6 from now on, it is my baby.   tl;dr rush when playing rush   CS5. That's all I'm sayin'.   And on PS3 don't forget the PS3 guys.   Also a less permanent method is a small piece of blue tack (hope I spelt it correctly).   Willing to donate 5 towards donuts we should do this   I got kicked for doing this once, also spamming "go go go".  	22
 A while ago in my apartment we had a lot of dishes to be washed. So what we did was take a shower while making meals with the remaining clean dishes. After we finished, we cleaned those dishes in the shower bath, so they would not increase the pile, and the cycle continued.   A *motherfucking*   horse mask.   **The end, from The Doors.**  Those who already listened to this song will know why.      Hey man, you are a very talented musician and your videos are **AWESOME**! Do you have a band or any of the sort?      We know very little about the universe. I mean, we do know a thing or two but, in scale, the universe is an unknown for us. So, my theory is that: if a **''never-seen-before infinite amount of energy''** strikes Earth in a fraction of second, destroying everything that we know, we all would be dead so fast that none of us would feel it coming. And this can happen at any time! The universe is infinite, so no one can prove that a disaster like this can't happen. It just freaks me out thinking that we could die at **ANY** moment due to a unknown space event of enormous strenght...      WOF.

 I just listened to that song yesterday for the first time since I was a teenager. Coincidence.   I'm still baffled as to how you understand what it says /u/FloydMayweatherJr   Came here from the repost, fuck that other guy!   **REPOST**. Also he is in front of the Apple Stand in the middle of the pile of boxes. Now try and find Reddit....he's in the petting zoo.   Is that Hillary Duff?? Haven't heard anything about her in years!   WOW what are the odds!?........oh right its only 365/1.   [ummmmm...](http://scene7.samsclub.com/is/image/samsclub/0001790099635_A?$img_size_380x380$)   That's not flying! That's falling, with style.    when his 200 Jeep Cherokee inexplicably went onto the shoulder and hit the trailer.   nbsp;  I'm guessing this was at around the same time he momenterily thought he was starring in an Action Movie.   Damn I'm 3 hours too late, I was going to say that. Still better than OP I guess.   And know I have a work boner.   Thanks man  that was a close one. We're even now.   I'm going to murder you all! lol joke. Once upon a time...   "Never start an essay with I."   I wish the would assign jogging to a button instead of the stick, when trying to pick stuff up it gets quite frustrating when you push the analogue a tad too much and your guy just jolts forward. Other than that I turned the camera sensitivity up so I can turn faster.   "Pink Box" Is that what kids call them nowadays??    True 0 gravity.   I hope you mean Rest In Poo. Only place people like that deserve to rest.   DON'T GO TO VACATION TO BRAZIL!! ...I saved your life, now you owe me yours.   First the charity thing now this? Seems like people are slowly but surely opening their eyes.      You just made me realize people who watch movies with voiceovers do not get to fully enjoy the magic that is Morgan Freeman.   LOL America sucks when it comes to health care.    nbsp;  "Welcome to the world!! Your admission fee is $20,000 please"   This is the worst ELI5 response ever. What 5 year old child is going to read and understand that??   I could afford to move out of my parents house and buy a decent car. Essentially it could kick-start my life.   Exactly this, she just seems like the typical "weak in character" teenager who can't or doesn't know how to say no. Fuck that bitch, get a real woman.   Probably profit but tbh it prefer it that way. It's **your** pokemon game.   Main reason, there are better games you could be wasting your time with. Other reasons also revolve around me hating the lie that was Destiny.   It's nearing 6 o'clock where I am, Monday has had it's toll on me.   Why waste the HDD space?   Yeah, because this guys reeks of extensive medical knowledge..   OP's Mom.   Poor snake is enjoying a post meal swim after gobbling on what looks like an alligator and gets grabbed by the tail by these stupid red-necks. The snake probably threw its food up after this and lost a meal whilst an alligator lost it's life for nothing. Well done you hill billy fucks, well done..   So is OP a bundle of ~~dicks~~ sticks or are we just teasing? I need to know whether or not I should start sharpening my pitchfork.      I friend of mine unfortunately lost his life last week. One fo the first thoughts that came to mind was;    nbsp;  His life may have ended but his story has just been written.    Love your art, hate your subject. Sorry.   I'm slightly disappointed that it wasn't home made toilet paper.   ~~Seriously, who writes these online articles? They aren't that long so a proof read must be quite easy to do yet this kind of shit always happens.~~   nbsp;  ~~**Guy** is being praised as a hero.~~  ~~"I'm overwhelmed," **she** said. "I'm just a pizza deliverer, that's all."~~   I just realised her name is Guy, my bad Reddit. Carry on, nothing to see here.   how tall are they on average? How many bananas??   **CHEESY POOFS**   Nah man this stuff is gold.   So what was that pinball game you were looking for??   No you didn't.   well...TIL.   The same way [this](http://www.sbmania.net/pictures/27b/262.png) happens, it's a cartoon.   Same with me and any whisky. Got really drunk, passed out and woke up in hospital. Since that night I can't even smell whiskey without gagging.   I've tried over and over again to drink and actually like beer. I'm 24 now and it still tastes like piss in a bottle to me. Don't understand how people can actually enjoy it.   II don't know what your talking about, still tastes like piss in a bottle to me and I'm 24 now.   Firstly this is more of a lower class computer and secondly the actual opposite is happening. Middle class is not emerging it's disappearing. So yeah this company has little to no knowledge of their target market.    Mario Kart?? Go home Dad.   You look like a baby Mr.Potato   "*Freedom*"   This. When something's wrong I go to the hospital, they fix me, I leave. Done deal.   Hit me up if you visit Gibraltar!!   We do, we only eat a small percent of the animals than we could actually eat.    Fucking twat.   That both fucking amazing and hilarious, thanks for posting the link!   If you watch it a few times it starts to look like she's doing it on purpose and starts getting pretty hilarious.   Dang, guess I don't qualify. Story of my life!   I was ogling how pretty she was than I had a really creepy thought about how she is probably maggot food by now.    This hurts the eyes. I don't know why.   Maybe they were photographed separately and then shopped together?   Because the angles seem off.   Amazing!   "**DUDE, YOUR FUCKING ARM!!!**"   "I know man...I lost my tat." *sobs*   Nah man, she's too fat for me.   Your* These imaginary people are retarded.   Not a glitch, a hack. Hopefully he will soon be banned.   HOLY MOTH BALLS ON STICK BATMAM!!   My mind had completely forgotten about this game. So much nostalgia, so much good times!!   Edit: and I just bought one, thanks guy!!   Don't know why you got downvoted, don't worry I fixed it. I was watching on mute as well and yeah Kevin's face was pretty much a mirror of my feels.   I hope she's not. If she is making a living out of this I am done with the world and starting a stream of my own.   You glorious person!! Thanks.   Nah man, my boner just doesn't fit in the toilet bowl.   How do you get a boner inside a toilet bowl?? Do you sit like [this?](http://s-ak.buzzfed.com/static/imagebuzz/web04/2010/3/14/15/how-to-pee-with-an-erection-5075-1268594776-81.jpg)   I carefully shave them off, it's a dangerous game though because to get the best results you have to be some what erect and if you manage to cut yourself whilst erect well.... F. thankfully I've managed to escape that horrible fate for now.    On another note never use a trimmer near your shaft!! I made the horrible mistake once of using a trimmer for my ballsack and I ventured to far up, the guard was on but that was no help. The trimmer caught and sliced a bit of skin under my shaft. I was too ashamed to go to hospital or anything so I put a plaster on it and it eventually closed. That was a really worrying week.   I've always wondered, does admiring your own boner make you gay?   nbsp;  On the one hand you're getting impressed by a dick   ~~On~~ with the other hand you're holding that dick   He mean's it's in the store, as in you can see it. The game hasn't been released yet though, release date still TBA.   although I agree with the notion of letting people do what they wany the whole don't pre order "campaign" on Reddit atm is to try and get people opinions to change, it's not an order but a suggestion. If we keep pre-ordering and companies realise this all they will do is cram amazing trailers and rumours down our throats in order to get all our pre-orders then they really don't have to do much more. They can produce a mediocre game and still make bank.   but seriously though, that calf is huge!!!   Edit: Why downvotes?? I may like big calves. I don't, but you don't know. You do now. HOLY FUCK THOSE ARE SOME HUGE CALVES!!   I sleep alone in a box, both my wife and dog are dead, these fucking Russians are going to pay.   No that's not how you tame a horse in Minecraft.   Because imaginary characters can't talk? Or is that not what we're doing here?   Would be awesome if it did though, would keep you on top of you game.   This has slightly blown my mind, the fact that they've gone through this effort to provide a mini real life Easter egg. The Devs of this game are absolutely amazing, Can't wait for the DLC!!   The build up to the finale was pretty intense, the run through the sewers in particular had my heart racing. The climb up to the tower was also pretty good and tbh the QTE wouldn't have bothered me that much **if** it weren't the only bit of fighting in the finale. A nice trap room full of zombies that you had to clear to get to Raiz would've been a lot more entertaining and would've made the final QTE tolerable. I'm not not mad, I'm just slightly disappointed that there wasn't one last final "fuck yea moment" when you finish clearing the room of zombies and stop to admire your work.   Anybody have the list of characters in this pic??   I used to work with some who had lazy eyes, I would just swap as to not discriminate.   Anyway of getting a list of these people?? it would go along way to dividing the idiots from eh rest of the population.   Really? You can sue for some one leaving a note about you? that's seems even more childish than the note that was left in the first place, america is weird man.   I know right, there's so many things wrong with this game that I don't even have time to explain why I don't have time to explain.   Destiny - like real life, only worse.   ps4?? WE GOT A DAYWALKER!!!   Dying light has a big open world where you can free run through and smash zombie skulls in.   Save your money and most importantly your time, don't bother with this "game".   so what happens all the other times? Are they all draws?   This guy gets it!   I bought it last week at full RRP. One week later and I still don't regret buying the game.   [OK!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCvgwsgq6pY)   The kid walking away crying to the right is my favourite, he's like "fuck this shit, I'm out!!"   Edit: Or the one that's just realised what's happening and is "noping" the hell outta there pronto. I can't decide!   The phantom hand is really unnerving.   That Luz Opal is mindblowing, reminded me a bit of the [pillars of creation](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/68/Pillars_of_creation_2014_HST_WFC3-UVIS_full-res_denoised.jpg/982px-Pillars_of_creation_2014_HST_WFC3-UVIS_full-res_denoised.jpg)      Plus it's a blatant handball    I wish I could see his reaction when playing the video back for the first time.   you up for starting a new game on Hard?? I'm looking for someone to see this whole thing through.      I'm guessing the dog realised it wouldn't get told off for pooping under the bed, smart dog, and apparently the owner has no nose.   The main problem with politics is the language barrier. Big complicated words are used so normal people can't understand wtf is going on.   The studs being all uneven is bothering me.   did they ask enough times to reach quantum mechanics?   dumb parents = dumb babies. Maths checks out.   I'm just waiting for the "That's my car comment" then waiting for it to be in /r/bestof.   Does it work?? If it doesn't I really don't see the point, it would be too much of a tease.   Google image search gave me a nice surprise.   http://cdn.rsvlts.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/KqZmMac.jpg   	111
 I really don't know too much you can do because I believe it does partially have to do with hand size. However there's hope that maybe your practice balls are a bit worn. Our team sets aside 3 balls that are top notch and only designated for games, so maybe that'll help your cause. Also maybe just work on some ball handling skills in practice. For instance not picking the ball up on top, or maybe turning your hand during your pump fakes to so it wont fall out.   The main goal is to ride the board up. I used to throw my dives early and hard and ya I would get around because it was fast but my height would suffer. Give it a strong push and don't throw for your dive until the board is finished pushing you up. It's hard to get the timing but after a while with someone watching you you'll get the hang of it.  	2
 The new Wolfenstein, really good. Old-school shooter, with some stealth bits.  Not as polished graphically as the new Killzone, but I'm enjoying it much more.   Yeap, I was pre-caffeinated.

The perilous state of the Australian environment gives Diamond reason to suspect that Australia may be the first developed state to collapse under environmental pressures. This may initially seem absurd to many Australian readers, but Diamond demonstrates convincingly that societies typically collapse when at the height of their dynamism and affluence, because that is precisely when resource demand is greatest."](http://www.theage.com.au/news/Reviews/Collapse/2005/02/23/1109046981193.html)   Blocklists are a good place to start.

I suppose he could have thought it was a different vote he was being asked on, though if that were the case - he hardly deserves a vote either.  Yeah, completely surprised me.

To the genuine eoin2**0**17, you have my sympathies.    Asked whether he thought the issue of water charges would hinder the partys performance, he said well wait and see. The people of Ireland actually **know quite well** that there was difficult decisions had to be made in the last three years.  So what's the cost per litre of water under Irish Water then Phil?    Plus he [abstained](http://www.votewatch.eu/en/us-nsa-surveillance-programme-surveillance-bodies-in-various-member-states-and-impact-on-eu-citizens-9.html) from a very reasonable vote to increase EU citizens' privacy rights post-NSA/Snowden.  Still don't understand that one.   Phil, lend me your salary.      If we had more like this on T, I'd be inclined to watch it.   So does Enda, I think his hair is the only part of him that is doing its job.   It would at least need 'like' at the end of it.   And how would you describe your second sentence?   I can't imagine what it would be like to have been bereaved or damaged by all that violence, yet then presented with a 'blank slate from now on' type solution.  For those that have managed, they have my enduring admiration and a little wonder - bestest Buddhas in the world, I reckon.     I'm not well versed in what really went on up in Northern Ireland, apart from what the media reports. It wouldn't surprise me if there was blood to spare for all the hands involved.  But I thought the whole point of the peace process was: to stop any more violence, and any more recrimination.  I think that first part has more or less happened - so I'm going to accept the second to ensure the first; as wrong as that may be - it's better than more bloodshed.  I'm not looking past the past, I'm trying to look at a calmer future.   If you really can't vote for anyone, still go, but spoil your vote - you can even write a little reason why on the ballot and it will get read.  If all the people who don't think it's worth voting spoiled their vote that tally in itself would send a message. Your vote would count in exactly the way you intend.  Always vote, doodle a Dustin even ;)    Well, they did insist on voting No to the Lisbon treaty the first time round till we got a better deal out of it - that happened.  And when Brian Cowen's FF refused to hold a by-election for 17 months (instead of within the normal 6) - it was Sinn Fin that went to the courts to get it sorted.  I remember that, it informs my vote - as well as my opinion of the parties that didn't contribute to a resolution.   I suppose one way of doing it is seeing who you don't want to vote for. Work out why you won't vote for them - then see is there's a candidate closer to your ideas.  I can choose with a (reasonably) good conscience 3 MEPs for my 4 seat constituency, but who I want for my 4th - I'm still trying to decide.   For security cameras I went with an [Odroid U3](http://hardkernel.com/main/products/prdt_info.php) - affordable and more than enough capacity as a home server, security cam, ftp and all the usual goodies. I have 3 cameras feeding into the Odroid and use 'motion' to sense   ftp the images. This barely stresses the Odroid.  They're fanless, quad-core 2gb-ram little beasties with no more of a learning curve than a Pi. Also, they're a tiny bit smaller than a Pi.  I keep the Pi for XBMC   hobby projects. The GPU hardware drivers on the Pi makes them slightly better at XBMC than an Odroid.  But for server, desktop-computer   game-emulator purposes the Odroid is very hard to beat at the price. Plus, the [forums](http://forum.odroid.com/viewforum.php?f=75 sid=10ba83ada948d9cf878eaeaa83530e9d) are great. Do go for an eMMC card if you buy one, much faster than the SD card option.   I guess they reckon everyone who had it will double-dip if it comes to PS4.  If it ever did, I'd love a free-fly / move mode and would probably lose days with a level designer ...

 Yes we lost, but we lost with 24 unanswered points in the last 4 seconds to a field goal. Yes we have things to fix, but our receiving corps isnt really one of them in the way that we thought. With Tate down the Ground Pound that is West and Crowell was AMAZING amassing TD's and Yards against the vaulted LaBeau DEF like they were a collegiate team. HOYER THE DESTROYER broke bad in the second half in a serious way. This isnt a bullshit team, and it's gonna get easier from here. *EDIT: Spelling and GO BROWNS*      Yes    No. That was as a flop, or being scared, or actually being payed by the Steelers on the sly.  Did you SEE how fast his head whipped around to watch the play unfold? That play has "sketchy weirdness" all over it. Either by him not really wanting to play football for a living, or by him throwing this game.    I cant even tell they are happening.   Like how people still talk about Big Ben and his sexual improprieties? Yeah. Some people just dont shutup.   I see you DROPPIN' his name.    You're a good man for trying!    Thank you!

My girlfriend has agreed to a Browns Emblem on the car. I want a Chrome Brownie so bad I can taste it, but they are nowhere to be found. Can you find it, sir? Can. You? *edit:spelling*     It's awesome. It's huge, hard to get a table and FULL  OF ORANGE AND BROWN. I think I'm gonna be there....    Born and Raised in Kent, Ohio. Live in Index, Washington!

Some people are really hurt by the losses and the problems,  and I don't want to upset them.  I just travel a lot. A lot.  You have to have a good sense of humor, and thick skin, being a Browns fan on the road. And we are Shakespearian in our comedy of errors, sometimes, that I cant help but see the humor.    I would have voted for one of each, had there been an option.   Right on. I'm just trying to be goofy and bring some levity to the forum, but I am NOT trying to be disrespectful.

Go Browns. *EDIT: And thank you*    It's a deep level of 'funny' that we didn't fill out the score and place the lone 'W' next to the Bears. We are quick to put the losing scores in, but we subconsciously worry about claiming our victories. Probably because we all think the Browns are the only team in the NFL that could blow a 19 point lead a week after the game's over.    I totally stole yours this year    Jordan CamRon Burgundy's Mustache   Gratzi   I personally already think he would look good in that pass rush of ours,  and we already are a media storm,  so....      Alignment   I think that after seeing another "Indians go 6-3 probably higher than most Browns scores by halftime" posts on twitter I just snapped a little this morning, and it was early. I have since learned who he is. /r/Browns is the place to learn whatever you dont know about the organization. He seriously just has never really come across my feeds. I'll have to search him out actively for a bit and check him out    Nah, I don't work in sports.    Maybe he's just learned how to use Bleacher Report (LOL joke)   That is surprising as hell, to me. I live on social media. It's my job. I never see this guys name. I see Plain Dealer, ESPN, Beacon Journal all over my feeds. I never see this guy.  *EDIT: upvoting /u/brownielf for the heads up*    There's always the Titans.   All of the sudden this chuckle head has a lot to say about the Browns. All bad. Never heard of him. He just shows up a week or so ago and is just running his mouth. Is he a newspaper reporter? Blogger? Candied Apple salesman in the Muni lot with an ignorant and public opinion? At least Mike Freeman constantly talks shit because he is actively scouting the Browns to find our faults. This guy Tom Reed comes out of nowhere like an "old hand" spraying cat shit. Blarggh.   I was good for 3 of those B4B pics. Nice compilation :)   Its also titled "Allegedly caught". I can see that SOMEONE doesnt WANT TO BELIEVE.    No, this is: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIwgnpTNUkQ   Boobs were great during the Reddit Growth Drive, and I will upvote any new submissions, but I am all about it being a seasonal thing. It is like Christmas, or Taco Tontos being closed on Sundays: It keeps things fresh and doesnt allow us to just totally run something awesome into the dirt.   TL:DR 1: Will upvote boob pics 2: Thinks keeping Boobs 4 Browns seasonal is the way to go 3: Will upvote new boob pics *edit: grammar*   Did you read the part where I said I was a Hoyer fan? You sound like the clown, yinzer.   I think he might actually be the Personification of Brownie. Brownies are helpers who thrive on chaotic situations, *like the story of the brownies fixing all the cobblers shoes*, and he seems to only get better when things are falling down around his head; which makes him almost TOO powerful while playing for Cleveland.  *edit: spelling*   I am a Hoyerastafarian. I think he is the right QB to lead this team. With that said: How the hell is Johnny so accurate on the run, throwing across his body, with feet jumbled around like a river dancer?

He is a local,  and he is schizophrenic. He had never talked to me before (I'm new in town) and today he came up to me and told me about "Sound and Light Terror Grids" he says they are compressing light and sound within these grids, and that it is an attempt to make us blind and deaf. He says that only special breathing patterns,  and REALLY clean water can help prevent it. He also told me they have been working these things on us since we were little. I don't discount crazy. I do however run it by reddit.   Its true. My exploits on reddit often take me to making fun of Ravens fans, which is a celebrated pastime in Cleveland. Since it doesn't get me just over flowing buckets of upvotes, (as you can see on both your post and this one) maybe I'm just doing it because I enjoy sharing, and not because I am garnering some kind of up vote support. I get my life fulfillment from traveling, my job as a minister, and having sex with my wife. This is what I do for fun, not validation. So drop the down vote. Ravens suck. Lol.  *edit spelling*   This is not Rallying the troops. This is sharing. Rallying would be if I was asking you to do, anything. Sorry if I offended your reddit sensibilities, /u/chuckyjc05 I'm really just sharing exploits of a Browns fan on reddit with the subreddit for the Browns.   I made a comment on the fact that the Ravens are in 32nd place for Reddit growth. I just wanted to share the exchange. Heres the link:   http://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/2ei4v1/subreddit_growth_results_after_the_third/cjztgvu   I made a Raven boohoo on this thread because I said "LOL Ravens suck" his only response was "Says the guy with no flair" leave it to the Ravens to bitch about flair usage.   I'm also impressed that 4 people other than you don't hate Baltimore. That's a negative Karma score that truly, truly impresses me.   *EDIT: Since the posting of this, people have upvoted my original from -4 to 0*   No. Thats why I hate it.    I'm a Browns fan. Cant wait to see your throwback jerseys, son.   The one that really grinds my gears is when I hear a Steeler say "Here we go Steelers Here We Go!"    Lol. Ravens suck.    Well, now it's roached.

Does a DUI count toward substance abuse? It's a substance based breaking of a law, but it wasnt him failing a drug related NFL rule. I'm still confused on that.   I'm sure your statement will weed out those that try to seed this thread.       Yeah, he was sitting on top of 70 passed drug tests and a lawsuit.   I never had Gessford, though he retired my Senior Year. I had Atkins.

Born and raised Rough Rider Alumni. I'm with ya.   At the end of the day we're all AFC North.       "Conner Shaw-nuff you right he had a 151 passer rating" I'm still working on it.    I agree with you. I also have been a big fan of him as a pickup since the Draft. My prediction was that Hoyer would get bumped out for Manzeil, then around game 8 I see him getting creamed on a scramble, and then they bring in Shaw and he lights it up not only that game, but for the rest of the,  year. He starts in Johnny comes back at the beginning of '15, plays 2 games, they bring Shaw back, he takes us to the Super Bowl.      That's fair: Now I downloaded it to my computer and it froze my whole system up after the 2 hour download and made a weird little window that wouldn't go away, or even let me open my Task Manager, sooooooo now it's confirmed on my box to be a bunch of crap, and a large site doesn't denote a safe site. Gratzi.    I don't know about on your computer,  but on the mobile it takes you to what looks like a phishing page.  Went to real Google Play and downloaded the actual app it asks you to get? Yeah,  doesn't work to open the game up. It still takes to to the same "Download this app to proceed" page.  If you have better luck on your desktop/laptop,  let me know.    As a matter of fact, there is even a bar on the SIM. If its connected to the Browns Reddit, we might even be able to get players to make avatars and come talk. They do that with musicians all the time. Trent Reznor will come on play a live show and have his computer set up in the room and it live relays his performance. We could use FRAPS and record the interviews and throw it onto youtube and feature it here. It would be cool to have the first Second Life Browns Backers group. *spelling*   So,  Second Life is considered its own country. It has its own currency that is traded on the stock exchange (The Linden Dollar '$L') and it's public, free, and online. Not only that, but I have access to an entire parcel of land that would be all about us meeting there. Just a thought     the NFL is a SFW hobby  Yeah.  What with all those role models getting shot, beating their significant others unconscious, battling drug addiction, and murdering folks.      The OP shames herself by posting naked pictures on an open forum,  and it's not my intention to shame her regardless.    Uhhhh, That's shaming. You just said she is a shame unto herself,  and then you said it wasn't your intention to shame.  For shame. I'm a left wing hippy (gun toting). I am disappointed.     http://i.imgur.com/SkfjGFf.gif   Yet here you are in r/Browns :)   Http://www.aquatabch.org Its a fertiliry religion :)   Hair draping over boobs :)         The ladies from church wanted to help out. :)         Let me see what I can do.   Well, she IS a Steelers fan...and are you saying he was acting like a "LaBeau"? Huh? Huh? Amiright?    Im also wearing an all orange shirt today, and she had on her Steelers jacket.   I walked into the bank today, I live in Seattle, and there is this blonde girl that works behind the counter who is a Steelers fan. The very first time that I saw her I joked "Aren't you say Seattlite? Why the Steelers gear?" She looked at me and said   "I don't give a f*** I like the Steelers they are a good team they win I don't care about the Seahawks I mean I'm a fan I guess but I'm a Steelers fan first."   After that she wouldn't look at me or wait on me at all so I just went in there today and had to put in a deposit and she was the only one there. I walked up and I said "I'm sorry I give you crap about being a Steelers fan." And she said   "I don't give a s*** you're just mad cuz we have six and you have one!"   To which I realized she thought i was a Seahawk fan, so I replied "I'm a Browns fan." Her demeanor instantly changed; a big smile crossed her face and she said   "oh, well you got 0."   And I said "yep we've got 0 but I guess we can at least hate the Ravens together"   and she said "f*** the Ravens"   and I said "f*** the Ravens"   and she said "and the Browns"   I said "hey f*** the Steelers"   and we both laughed and we said "f*** Cincinnati"   and then now we're friends and she smiled as I walked out the door. And that is what it means to have the best rivalry in all of the NFL. And I got to cuss in the bank.   http://www.amazon.com/NFL-Cleveland-Browns-Garden-Gnome/dp/B001EO48KE  He's the last one on Amazon!   This guy, ftw ^^!

"How many common bear skeletons has humanity EVER found in the wild?"   Still think Daniel Radcliff's "Barkevious Mingo's Mum" was pretty epic.    My teams name is "Jordon CamRon Burgundy's Mustache" I even made a picture last year: https://twitter.com/TheJackalope/status/385529932228476928   There is a bus that had a water gun attached to it,  and they soak the new people and they walk by. My grandfather was like: "Stop. Look at the water. Where do you think it came from?" I looked at the bus and it sprayed this huge stream out.  It was awesome.   It would be wrong of me to give it away. You should make the pilgrimage sometime!    So you've decided to be a Browns fan? Well, there's a couple things that you need to know to successfully navigate wearing the Orange and Brown.    Number 1: "Don't worry, there's always next year." Now I know what you're thinking: "Why would he be saying there's always next year? We haven't even started this year." This is part of the sacred Tao that is being a Browns fan. It is a mantra that many of us have prayed over, because we know, possibly more than anyone,  that there is no such thing as a sure thing.  Number 2: "We are the hipsters of football fans" I said it. We as Browns fans only support teams that won championships before the institution of the Sellout Bowl. I mean Superbowl. *dons orange and brown flannel shirt, horn rimmed glasses and knit cap*  Number 3: That being said learn who Paul Brown, Jim Brown, Lou Grouza and Otto Graham are.  Number 4: If you're one of the new fans who is going to have the pleasure/privilege/luck of attending home games at FirstEnergy Stadium, be ready to be part of a stadium where you cant have glass bottles! That's right Browns fans like to throw bottles onto the field and the stadium banned their use after one such incident. We are rowdy.  Its fun.   Number 5: You also can't bring in items from outside, into the stadium. After we could not throw bottles somebody decided to throw batteries.  Number 6: If you get to tailgate before the game in the Muni lot, and you see a large bus. with the ground completely saturated with water in front of it, just keep walking forward and don't contemplate the situation.   Number 7: Cornholing is no longer just a sexual slur.  Number 8: F*** the Steelers. (Like for real. We dont like those guys. Ravens[ratbirds] either)  Number 9: Its a Brownie, not an Elf  Number 10: All contributions to televised football aside, we know that Art Modell is actually a multi time failed business man who is the only person to ever bankrupt a football team.   Number 11: The plain orange helmet is sacred.   Number 12: Next Year Is Coming.   I'm sure others may have more to add below, but this is a gift from me, 31 year Browns fan, to you as a bright eyed new dawg ready to get a bark or two out in the pound this year. Welcome.   Ummmmm,  no. Aquarian Tabernacle Church marketing guy, yes.

And I hate BP so much I do my best not to use aluminum, because BP controls Lions shares of the aluminum produced in the world. I'm appalled at what they did. My spirituality is one of deep connectedness to the living organism that is our "planet". That being said: I want other opinions so I don't stagnate. And this ish is bugging me,  so I asked y'all. *edited for spelling because my phone is a champ*   I had heard that BP was looking to recoup some of what they had to pay out because they believe they over payed. I was wondering what you all thought?  	116
       I think it depends a lot on the location and what type of statistics you do (e.g. biostats, machine learning, big firms, startups, etc). One of my MS friends started with 55k (Toronto) working as a SAS programmer for a small HR firm, and I've also hear cases where they start with 80k with just 6 months experience.   Yeah, this I figured out as well, didn't quite understand why people would use it.      Some honest opinions.  1) Why is your team so big? Why do you need 6 people and what do each of them do?  2) Traction to date?  3) Slides 5   6 - I would avoid using the pictures you are using, they make the deck look unprofessional.  4) Why do you want to raise 125k? How do you plan to use that money?   I don't quite understand what the site is doing, tbh.         I think there are a lot of similar services already, so it would have to be substantially different for most people to start using, IMHO.               I heard nothing. I am just hoping, nothing more.   Metroid is a good series, definitely something to hope for.   personally, I'd like to see The Elder Scrolls VI.                        What's the point of this? Why not just use angelist of some other legit websites?            What's the Shoshone exploit?   I see what you are saying, but if you play lower levels, you could lose get a free worker if you declare war early, just not that early.   Higher level usually means you'd need to fight for room, not building your own settlers.   couldn't agree less.   definitely infantry.   Keep on hearing people say deity is so easy, blah blah blah, so I'm really curious how good people really are. Personally, I've never defeated Immortal or Deity.      MORATAAAAAAAAAA!!!

 Definitely this   Getting used to drinking a lot of water can definitely suck. Just try to force yourself to drink more. I'm not talking about over-hydrating or anything crazy, but the more often you drink water the easier it gets to maintain good hydration levels.  Also you will pee a lot.  	2
 It's a fun day trip to continue on from the date farm to Tecopa, Shoshone and then Death Valley.   A swimming pool.  I've had it empty for the last 6 years now because it costs too much to have it refinished,  and I'm concerned about the extra water and utility use with global warming.     I know.  I've been waiting my whole life.               Years ago, we had a welfare march in my town to protest some of the policy decisions from our state that cut many people off the rolls.  There was also an anti-welfare march to support those policy decisions.  I later met the leader of the anti-welfare march.  He had had a heart attack, his wife left him, and he lost his house.  He was trying to get legal assistance when I met him.  It could happen to any of us.  Oh, and by the way, I just wish I would hear as much complaining about corporate welfare which probably surpasses all of the welfare programs - and generally ends up in just a few pockets.   You are right.  I meant cheaper to make.   If men and women make up that 60%, half would be 30%.   I love this!   I hurt for the younger generations, but I'm not sure that is the answer.  I want those programs there for them also.   Of course, I know what percent of taxes people pay.  Did you know that the top rate use to be 90%?  Money has been devalued on purpose!  I saw the head of the manufacturer's lobby on c-span during the Bush administration saying that was their goal.  They want goods to be cheap enough for Americans to afford them.  They also want to pay less for wages.  The bottom 45% pay a higher percentage of their wages in payroll taxes.  I think the low-income tax credit was a subsidy to businesses to be able to pay low wages to workers and still make huge profits.  I think in a sense that is what the Obamacare is also - a subsidy to companies like Wal-Mart who do not want to pay for health care for thier workers.  So we were all paying for it anyway, at hospital emergency rooms.  I worked at Welfare and saw the flyers Wal-Mart was giving to thier employees to go apply for medicaid.  What is right about that?  There is another submission I saw on Reddit today that says poor people get the same amount of GDP as do the rich in terms of tax benefits.  Found it:  http://www.reddit.com/tb/15di1o  And contrary to some people's believes, the rich are not job creators.  It is only a race to the bottom.  We do better as individuals and as a country when we are all doing well, not just a few.    I hurt for the younger generations and we need to do what we can to help them, but at the risk of starving seniors?  We have enough for everyone.  Right now, corporation's chairmans and Presidents of their boards are walking away with all of the corporate profits.  Corporations have one goal:  profits, not the improvement of society or their workers.         You are making the assumption that it is all the fault of social security and medicare.  We have been spending a billion a week for years on a war.  Social security isn't even a part of the budget.  Boomers paid 110% more than they should have to cover the costs of social security.  Americans LOVE those programs and will pay for them.  This has been a plan by republicans to starve the beast - and get rid of those programs.   Yep.   You needed the spending to avoid a huge depression.  They used to call government spending "priming the pump", when private enterprise is not spending, government needs to spend.   It didn't cost much in interest rates.  Republicans screamed about the deficit during Clinton years - and poof - it was gone in no time when everyone went to work.  It is higher now, and it will stay high through the boomer's retirement, but it is not so excessive as to break the county.  Wiki "the two-santa theory".  Large Federal spending has been historically higher under republicans.  They don't mind big-government, they just mind big-government money being spent on regular people.  They love the military and contracting with private enterprise.  We can go off the cliff, then the republicans can vote for a tax-break for 90% of the people, just not the rich.   Nice photo.   I would like to believe you are right, but I know so many crazys!   There are some translating companies also.   How about first making employees full-time.  Too many now have part-time jobs.   I will have to watch it.  Saw her on C-Span and she was great.   Yeah, let's help the corporations. Screw the people.      It's wierd submitting a reddit article to a subreddit!      Diplomacy puts Risk to shame, but you need 5-7 players, and lots of time.   Remember, George Bush was a cheerleader when many students were protesting the war,  And Romney was leading protests for the war.  There were two kinds of boomers.   isn't that how we all got started?   Apply online at the mgmcareers.com.  They are the major employer on the strip.  Who knows.  People do get hired.  I also know a woman who recruits for them also, normally low-paying jobs like guestroom attendents.  Mail me your resume and I'll get it to her.  She may be able to chek out if they ever hire on HIB visas, or whatever.   I'm so impressed.  Wish I could do this.    I remember Nixon's people calling him "Ain't no Way".   I've been wondering, if people love medicare   social security, rather than cut them, let's pay a little more for them -- with the condition that Congress can't spend the money on anything else.   I can't believe he is a supreme court judge.  I heard him quoting Fox News during the health care case - and he was wrong about it!  An idiot.   I think it is funny.   Congrats.  I get about 40 lbs, then breakdown, gain it back.  How do you keep going?   They have limitless money and they never stop.  Ethics mean nothing.   Escargo.   I wrote a term paper 40 yrs on the end of work.  We are in a transition needing less people to do more.   Check this out:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_End_of_Work   Thank you for your thoughts.   I'd like to read the article!   I'm so tired of these boys.  Just go away.....   nice.      I'm curious too.  The areas look beautiful.   I keep thinking of Linda Tripp, the civil servant who screwed Monica Lewinsky and Clinton.  She was offered a much better job but without civil service benefits or protections.  She took it and a year later, was laid off.  I think this job was to entice DeMint to leave.  And he will be pushed out of his new job in a year.   Good luck!   What was your original industry?        I'm torn.  There is a side of me that says "You vote these guys in office, you deserve what you get".  The problem is that we all pay for it.   Idiot.   Is there a Veteran's sub-reddit?  This needs to be posted there.      The corporate scam, yes.  But wouldn't it be cool if we could all have it.      When is she up for election?   At one time, I build my own solar heater for my pool.  Just coiled black flexible pvc pipe on my patio roof and ran a hose through my skimmer.  The water pumped through the pipes, heated the water which flowed back into the pool.  The water in the pool was almost too hot in the summer.   It is totally corporate-controlled by state statute.  A co-worker had it installed on his home at an upfront cost of $50,000 (probably close to the value of my house).  He got a $15,000 rebate from NV Energy which was the exact charge of installation (and he turned it over to the installers).  I found a group online in suburban Washington D.C. was able to start a co-op with an average cost of $1,500 per house.  You can't do that here without a change in legislation.  I would be up to working on this with people who want the law changed, and have just recently started to talk with people about it.  By the way, my co-worker pays $8/mo now.   Do you re-register for the general election?   Here comes our corporate court!   Important point.   And they have a history at stopping at nothing to get what they want.   I still love his movies, particularly the funny ones.   Good luck!  It's my 40th, and it's hard to believe I am this old!   Beautiful!   You can do white boards too - like you would see in a corporate office.   You can buy blackboard paint that works the same way.   It's fun.  Has a lighted canapy over several blocks.  I hear there is a zip line now.  The strip is more spread out.         Didn't Fox buy the History Channel a few years back?  That should be reason enough.   I would agree, but they stopped the craziness of the tea party house of the last few years.  TG for the Senate.   They treat their employees well.  I spoke with one guy who worked for Costco, left to go into the military.  When he returned, they rehired him,  but kept his pay and seniority as if he had been with them the whole time.   I think National Geographic gives grants too.   Conspicuous consumption, but beautiful anyway   When I was young, we used to take the turn at Glendale going north (off the highway heading to the Valley of Fire and Moapa), and would go to Warm Springs.  In those days, they had three swimming pools open to the public.  I haven't been there in almost 30 years now, and the last time I saw it, one was privately owned, and the other two pools were empty.  I'm not sure what it is like today, but it looks like it is a wildlife area now. http://www.snwa.com/env/wsna.html There are petroglyphs at the Valley of Fire.   Birthers.   Great idea!   I typed pubic instead of publc in a newsletter.  Used respectfully rather than respectively in a term paper.  I've done a few more, but these are the most memorable.   I missed that, but like it.      Management ought to go to jail.   It's Thom Hartmann who has a daily tv and radio show.   I thought it was a great presentation.  I posted it to economics also.   Interesting.     Good news!   9 and 1/2 weeks.  Loved the movie.  The book was sick and basically, just trash.   I wish the workers could take over the company.               I haven't been to BA, but have friends who used to go to Drink Liberally there...http://www.drinkingliberally.com.ar/   They decided on the partisanship the day Obama was inaugurated.   Move-0n has the software.  I used it a few years ago in my precinct.  Knew who was registered, who voted daily in early voting so they could be contacted to ensure that they turned out.      IrishJoe is right.  http://www.reddit.com/tb/12x9rg   It may be 10 years until we win the state houses and then can do our own gerrymandering after the next census.   I've never related to the South, but I thought the article was well-developed, sensitive.  I think many older white men have seen the threat of losing their position in society also - with the rise of women in the workforce.  Obama could have appealed to them through populism, but I'm not sure they could accept it.  Thanks for the post.      Sleezy.   Long live Nate!   Yeah, can you imagine the House voting for it?   I think I would rather eat than look towards the future.  duh.   I received a mailing from the "Catholic Association" yesterday urging me to vote for Romney.  The flyer had 6 thumbs up for Romney, 8 thumbs down for Obama.  I'm not Catholic, but am offended.   What happened to those campaign emails they were supposed to release a week or so again?   Right.   Not this bad, but I noticed it twice in the 70's.  First, the Viet Nam war created a huge divide among the young and the old.  Second, I went to a meeting at the Health Department to promote my grant for a community health center.  The room was packed.  I thought the people there were to comment on my half million dollar grant.  No, they were there to speak against a $10,000 family planning grant.   I was stunned.  I also thought Watergate would end it because it seemed so bipartisan, but it didn't, only made it worse.   Nice.   Too much work and organization.   Will you ever hear this on tv?   Good for you!  And welcome to the world of sane voters.   http://nvdemselectionnight.eventbrite.com/# This is the link to the Dems get-together.  It's usually pretty busy.     Republicans always get caught doing that they complain most about - I'm thinking about Larry Craig.  LOL.   There was also a related article about less work and increasing inequality - a digital Athens.  I think the real question is how do we get income to people who cannot find jobs due to automation.      Watch the movie "Same Time Next Year".  Our society is so screwed.  Why can't she love two people at the same time - in different ways.  Enjoy and try to get to the place where you can enjoy your time together, knowing it may never be the way you originally envisioned it.   I wrote grants for 25 yrs, but it's been about 15 yrs now, so not sure how much things have changed.  Federal grant mgmt offices used to like my proposals because I followed the instructions.  Lots of grant writers don't.   Look at the RFP (request for proposals).  If you know interest groups involved in the projects, ask them if they have any sample proposals to use as guidelines.   Funders generally tell you what they are looking for - and what information they want from you.  I used to joke that it was a term paper with a budget.  You want to try to make it interesting too; don't make it too dry.   How about deep fried twinkies.  Haven't tried them, but hear they are pretty good.    I met a photographer from NG.  He had written at least one book about his career there, which I gave as a gift, so unfortunately, I can't remember his name!  He started out there as an intern and was eventually hired by them. It's been a few years now, but he had worked for them for over 25 yrs.  I think he also had 2-3 covers on the mag.  Sorry, this is the best I can offer!   I'll never believe it.   One of the Naked Gun movies.   Beautiful!   Amen.      I don't have children, but don't mind paying taxes for schools because it benefits our society as a whole.   Except you could not get one vote from any one of them for any bill.   I love Bill Clinton but he did a lot wrong because he caved to republicans on important values.  We got the terrible trade bills like NAFTA that offered no worker protection, he signed the bill to get rid of Glass Steagal which paved the way for the crash.  And remember how they harrassed him to death with the special prosecutor, finally impeaching him.  Now, they act like he was a saint.   The only way to get a long with the current republican congress is to give them everything they want.  Remember during the republican presidential debate that the question was asked "Would you take a 10 to 1 cut in spending vs tax increase" and they all said they would not accept that.  You can't work with people who don't want to work with you.   There are structural problems in the Senate.  You need 60 votes to get anything through.  With  Ted Kennedy being  sick and then dying, the Senate didln't have 60 votes.  Pelosi passed a ton of bills in the House that couldn't pass in the Senate.  Dems are not like Republicans.  It's hard to get 60 Dems in the Senate to agree on anything.  I do think Campaign Finance reform would help.  Both parties are too tied to fundraising, lobbiests.   Yeah, and now they love him.   I'm envious.   He's not on the ballot for another 4 years (Senators have 6-yr terms, not 2-years as in the House).  The Senate has some flaws that make it impossible to govern without a 60 vote majority.  Getting rid of incumbents won't help.  They have learned that term limits only turn government over to lobbiests and bearucrats because they are then the only people who understand the system.  This is not what you want.  You may want to work to change the rules.  I saw an article once (wish I could find it) that it is also possible for the House to be highjacked by a small minority (like the tea party) so the House is unable to get anything done either.  Ideally, you want majorities of the same party in both houses to be able to get things done.     I'm sure that is why.    You have to vote partisan in Nevada because it is a swing state.  You can afford to give your vote for a real progressive in California!   I wish there were more Bernies.   I know how you feel.  But trust me, things can get worse.  Many of us saw this with Bush, and look where we are at today.  If you don't live in a battleground state, go for it.  I love most of the small candidates, including Jill Stein and Rocky Anderson.  If you live in a battleground state, you have no choice but to vote for Obama.  It's too critical not to.   Romney didn't run for a second term because he had a 31% favorability rating.  Additionally, he vetoed 800 bills passed by the Massachusetts legislature.  I didn't link the stats, but you can find them fairly easily by googling them.  So much for bipartisanship.  We have to end this plutocracy.  Our only hope we change the constitution or find a way out of this pay for play system, and save the middle class.  Otherwise, we will all lose.   I thought this was a great interview.  I wish there was more interest here about it.  We have to come up with some new ways of talking about this issue - and how we are going to address the future.   I wish they would do something about the Romney connection to voting machines also.   And the rant on over-regulation.  What jerks.   Sorry, I'm in Las Vegas.  Uncomfortable now using more water too.  My pool has been empty now for 5 years - looks pretty bad though.   Not a bad idea!  	143
 Noooooooooooooooooo   This has been an ongoing fight between my friend and me. She says that in the summer, the sea is colder than the air around the adjacent land, and in the winter, it's warmer. I don't think she's right. If she is, at what temperature does the switch happen?   Him: If you could have dinner with anyone who would it be? Me: Mark Twain Him: It has to be someone real   What about an arabic sounding accent? That wouldn't be sexy right? Because on the one hand you have the Islamic empire pre-1700 being super powerful culturally but then you have the whole colonized for centuries thing.

And on the artist's blog @ http://benlo0.blogspot.com/2013/11/futuristic-war-reporter.html   **Futuristic War Reporter**  Hey guys, here is something I did recently. This is something I wanted to try for a while after seeing all of those awesome futuristic sci-fi close up shot of a military personel from Maciej and all the other amazing artists. But I didn't want to do the exact same thing, a military lady with guns and body armor. So I did a little spin off, a front line reporter, someone who bring you the news from the war zones.   This might be the source @ http://shawntionary.com/chainmailbikini/?p=493   More details @ http://www.holovaty.com/writing/soundslice-sheet-music/   Thanks. I was not sure myself and looked up http://borderlands.wikia.com/wiki/Southern_Shelf_-_Bay which also has "Flows".   Reminds me of Metro 2033 video game.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xc2hhef-Nzo   Not sure about breaking a bone. But having had cancer and had to declare bankruptcy a year later I can tell you that it was expensive. I think I still have a picture of my $135K bill from the hospital and I was not done yet after 2 1/2 months of treatment.    When cancer comes back...   Having had cancer and survived it. This scares me the most. The possibility that cancer will return in a stronger more lethal form is something that keeps me up at night.     Its time to call America what it is: a kleptocracy, run by corporations and governments with only cosmetic distinctions. It is full of good people whom the kleptocrats keep fighting against each other, as they have for over 150 years, and will until the good people drown in rising saltwater or epic storms, or simply die, exhausted and used up.   Looks like you can buy it from iTunes or Amazon and get your money back. See http://recode.net/2014/03/15/warner-brothers-to-veronica-mars-backers-ok-ok-use-itunes-or-amazon-if-you-want/   I was just going to say this as well. Sounded to good to be true.    I know this breaks rule 2   3, but you should read his story as it pertains to cancer and insurance.  It wasn't until a few weeks ago when the formal denial letter came through that the gravity of the situation really hit home: because I hadn't lied when I saw my first doctor -- because I'd told them that I'd had stomachaches at any point in the past five years, whether or not I'd gone to a doctor for it -- I'd fallen under a fine-print pre-existing condition clause that said that any signs of illness that could possibly have led a doctor to a diagnosis since 2008 were cause for denying any compensation for any ailment of pretty much my entire alimentary canal.

          OH man. I think this was taken either Jungfrau or somewhere along the journey up to Jungfrau. All three (Jungfrau, Mnch and Eiger) are all part of the Bernese Alps. This photo was taken back in 2006 though, so I'm not exactly certain of the position that it was shot.   Curses! I have to work so no live stream for me :/  I'll write out the story in an email for you and Spacy for your show!   http://lildiaper.tumblr.com         True. But after serving with the USCG for more than a decade, there is a bit of love there :P   I know they're much smaller, but any chance of doing this with the aircraft of the US Coast Guard?   And now I need to go play Mass Effect 2....  Fantastic work though!         I can do that! When are you guys looking at recording this episode?   Gah! I used to live out there. My first real intro to ageplay with another person took place out there. I've got so many good memories of the area and want to go back so badly!   Thank you!   Awesome! I shall be waiting with baited breath :D   How long ago was this?   lol. Fair enough. Needless to say, I've loved the story and have read through it a few times! I can't wait to read what you put out next! Keep up the amazing work!   I don't suppose there's any plans for a sequel or another story set in the same setting (town, universe, which ever you prefer to call it) is there?   YES!!! I would love to see an adult pull up that isn't shit.    The small boat in question is a 64' SPC-SV (Special Purpose Craft - Screening Vessel). I am not sure of which sub was being escorted at that time.      While I agree, I don't think the USCG would be able to afford it. They can barely afford to upgrade their current fleet. And at one point, they had their ability to actually purchase new ships stripped from them by DHS!   I agree completely! Sadly, the Russians have a massive fleet of icebreakers.   Edit: I was misinformed.   The CIWS has numerous delicate cards within it to help with targeting and what not. When the ship would get up to a good speed or even some up on the turbines, the entire ship would vibrate horribly. And those poor cards would shatter in their holders since the vibrations were horrible right above the screws.   The Seventh District (which covers South Carolina, Georgia and most of Florida) is one of the busiest districts if not the busiest. Miami and Key West tend to have a lot more cutters. And some of the smaller cutters (87', 110') are sometimes homeported in small towns.    I'll see if I can find some over the next few days :)   I've noticed that there are still a few cutters missing. Things like the USCGC Vise and the USCGC Joshua Appleby. I'll do some more digging when I get home.   There is a list! It's the [USCG Light List](http://www.navcen.uscg.gov/?pageName=lightlists). It includes both federal (USCG Maintained) and private aids.   And each tender has a massive AOR! Not to mention that they will go help other tenders if needed.  	31
 Reproducing.   You already answered your question.   *Floating can be defined along the lines of: An object in a fluid experiences an upward force equal to the weight of the fluid displaced by the object.*  Whether it's laser etched metal, wood or concrete, they all obey the laws of physics.   @lisaslover has a good point but I will go ahead and answer your generalized question with a generalized answer.  *In General* many immigrant families do not feel social stigma about wearing glasses. In fact, in some cultures it signals that you are wealthy enough to get glasses and you have an office job rather than being a laborer. Many immigrants, include those from Asia, place a high importance on school and getting good grades. They probably tend to have their children's vision checked early and regularly and will correct it even at levels where other parents may not. Asian kids tend to be less into sports and therefore may not choose contact lenses which have higher incidences of secondary eye problems such as infections.   Can you be more specific? There are a lot of issues.   It doesn't "go" anywhere. On a hard drive there is an area that is hidden to you called a file directory. It's a catalog of all of the files on your hard drive, i.e. where the data starts and where the data ends. When you delete a file the catalog entry is deleted, not the data itself. The space once occupied by that file gets cataloged as free space that can be written-over when you save a different file.   Because you may decide to have another child some day. If there are enough people who are unvaccinated then the virus will be circulating in the community and your newborn, who can't be vaccinated for several years, will be at mortal risk.   I think it would be. But that window has passed and now we have a massive stalemate. Withdrawal is now practically impossible for Israeli politicians. Israel has the strongest economy in the middle east outside the oil kingdoms and there is massive immigration that they are dealing with. If I recall, pretty much any Jew can move to Israel. Netanyahu's answer is permanent development of the West Bank.  The ironic thing is that the immigration has also brought in more and more liberal views of non-Israeli Jews who grew up in Western countries. So maybe there is hope for a solution 20 or 30 years down the road.   You must win by more than the spread. The 1/2 point is just to help people understand that concept but it's not required. So if it's New England +10 then they have to win by 11 for you to collect. Books will say +10.5 points so they don't get a whole lot of questions if NE wins by 10. But whether it's +10 or +10.5, it's the same thing.   To make sure you either win or lose. In betting, ties are bad.   In a lot of ways, Palestine was a pawn. The 6 day war was ostensibly fought over Palestinian territory (from which Israel was carved) but it was really a political fight between Egypt, Syria, Jordan and Iraq vs. Israel. Like Vietnam, Palestine was a proxy for a war of religion/ideology/politics.  Without going into whether Israel did have or did not have a right to exist, had Israel withdrawn from the West Bank after its victory, I think relationships in the middle east would be much different today.   Because Israel is under the protection of the United States. The United Nations is powerless since the U.S. holds a seat and a veto on the Security Council. All they can do is issue demands that Israel halt development and occupation of west bank territories. They have no ability to force it.   I'm confused. Don't you mean that it's therefore both? After all, vulnerabilities get patched so isn't it a case that the initial design (done by humans) did not adequately anticipate an attack or improperly coded a function, thus creating a security hole?   They are therefore they can? Or they can therefore they are?   And you can't counterfeit gold or silver, so it's a stable for monetary use. There's also enough of it to mint coins for commerce (unlike other precious metals like paladium).   Cool. I think that makes sense. It's gotta be the forces right at the mouth. But that means the only surface that the force can act upon to MOVE the noodle into the mouth would be surface imperfections that transmit the force from high pressure to low, left to right (in relation in your drawing).  ASCII art:      F --/\   F --/\  F --/\     -----  --------  -------  ----     NOODLE     ---------  ------  -------  --           --\/   --\/    --\/   Ahhh, very plausible.   cnash, that is a very good analysis, except for one problem:  Axial stress. A wet noodle will distort under even very low loads.   That's what I'm thinking too. That it requires air movement and the air must be pushing on surface imperfections.  If you had a perfect seal between the noodle and your lips that did not allow any air to come through, the noodle would not move (even if there were no friction whatsoever). If the noodle surface were completely smooth, the noodle also would not move as the air passing over it has no surface to push on that doesn't have an opposite cancelling force.  So pressure differential doesn't fully explain the noodle movement. There must be air movement to make the noodle move.   It's still cylindrical, even when it's sitting between the lips and in your mouth. Ok, bye bye.   That's kind of my question. Sorry if I didn't explain well. What forces are not canceled? There must be a surface for the air to push on. Which part of the noodle? The itty bitty end? The cylindrical surface?   The noodle is cylindrical. Wouldn't the forces cancel if applied equally around the cylinder?   The noodle is cylindrical. All the forces would then cancel each other out.   When you blow on a balloon, it moves because there is more pressure on one side of the balloon than the other. Ever tried to push a wet spaghetti noodle? Yeah, it's all connected to itself but it's not stiff, therefore force does not transfer well.   To what part of the noodle is that pressure (force) being applied?   You know, I've asked this question of my friends and I gotta say, this is the best answer I've heard yet!   I get that your mouth is creating a vacuum but vacuum does not exert force. The force must come from the positive air pressure outside the mouth. What part of the noodle is the force pushing on?   The waves of a microwave oven are tuned to heat the water, which is exactly what you want when defrosting something frozen (because the water is what is frozen). Oven heat is absorbed by all of the mass of whatever you're defrosting.   Depends on where you're standing. Sound waves can add or cancel as they mix together.  (That's the science behind noise canceling headphones, which actually create a sound that is opposite in phase to the noise it's cancelling.)   If you lock up all the ones who test positive, you would save a lot of lives but at the expense of mistakenly imprisoning people who will never commit that crime. If you don't lock them up, more innocent people will die as a result.   There are a lot of visits to see an orthodontist and their assistants that all earn a wage, in a building that has an associated lease. And that orthodontist has paid for a bunch of equipment that they need, and malpractice insurance because you never know whether the kid who is getting braces is the child of a lawyer.   Nobody strives to create a healthy job market. They strive to create a product or service that people want, that they can charge money for and get rich off it. The job creation is just a side benefit.   If you took mass from the moon and brought it to earth then there is no net difference in the system. The moon would be lighter but Earth would have more mass and would exert more gravitational pull on the moon (I think). So from the laws of thermodynamics there won't be any change.   It's a civil contract. Jail and fines are to punish criminal violations.   In a civil contract, when the contract is breached you would sue in civil court. You would show that you were damaged by the actions of the other party and request some monetary amount of compensation.   Although society doesn't look at it this way, sexuality is supposedly a spectrum. I could see for someone who is in the middle of the spectrum (we would call them bisexual, I suppose), you could feel that way about the opposite sexes.   Cold soggy pasta is exactly why I don't like cold pasta so your explanation of pizza crust vs. pasta makes sense. To me, cold pizza crust is OK and I don't mind eating cold pizza at all. But I have to heat up leftover pasta because the cold noodles just taste all wrong to me.   If you need glasses it means your eyeball isn't perfectly round. If you're nearsighted like the majority of people, your eyeball is too long. Eyeglasses correct this by distorting the view and under-focusing so that the focus point correctly hits the back of your eyeball.   I thought I was clicking on "Compilation of girls from Russia." Then I thought WTF is this? Then I enjoyed it. Then I actually read the title.      Nice to know. They'll go on the market as soon as I get the new ones mounted. I dropped by Level9Sports yesterday and picked up some Head GTO 15 (DIN 5-15) for $99.   Modern structural plywood   wood frame homes can withstand quite a bit. Wood is great until you have to go over 4 or 5 stories, then it becomes a liability.   OK, tall highrise. Mass all the way up. The ground moves, the mass of the upper floors don't want to move, due to inertia. Shit bends.  In a steel frame high rise, an earthquake can damage and weaken the framework of the lower floors, thus causing the entire building to collapse.  You weld angle braces to strengthen the floors, like [these.](http://lh6.ggpht.com/_sd4aOA0Ur-I/SwNmHworrkI/AAAAAAAAIls/Gi4TDp-Q8AI/f0720025_thumb%5B3%5D.jpg?imgmax=800) But they can buckle due to axial load if they bend too far, so you put a concrete jacket around them, like [this](http://enr.construction.com/images2/2012/11/enr11052012cs_stadium_brbA.jpg) to keep them from going outside spec.   Females don't derive benefit from multiple partners as they can only be pregnant with one child at a time. Males can produce multiple pregnancies thus derive benefit.   Humans don't produce a lot of offspring, relative to other species. We don't have litters like dogs or produce thousands like a spider's egg sac. The goal is quality: Produce the best offspring and help them live.  So there's a tension between male and female. Females tend towards monogamy because they need a stable provider to help protect the few offspring. Males have tendencies to spread their seed around since they get so few opportunities to produce offspring.   Yes, I think Syriza will cave. They said what they needed to get elected. After all, politics is still about power. But when they face reality I can't imagine that they can be that stupid.   The trial was a farce from start to finish. There wasn't a jury that tried Saddam Hussein. It was a tribunal with American and British "legal advisors." His execution occurred less than two months after the verdict was rendered. Both Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch deemed the trial "unfair" and the U.N. declined to support it or its verdict because it did not meet international standards. The first chief judge of the tribunal actually resigned during the trial because he said that the U.S. and Iraqi governments were interfering and influencing the court. He was replaced. Saddam's lawyer was kidnapped and assassinated during the trial by Shias dressed as Iraqi police but the trial continued. One of Saddam's American lawyers, former U.S. Attorney General Ramsay Clark also decried the tribunal as unfair, and said that it was merely a show trial, that the U.S. was in fact running it while using Iraqis as a front.  The events for which he was tried occurred in 1982. But it wasn't until AFTER 9/11/2001 that America was interested in invading Iraq, capturing Saddam to put him on trial.   Pretty good summary. People are concerned about Greece and its weight on the Euro but I don't think people actually think a Greek exit is likely since it would set them back into the stone age.   As others have said, it shows that light behaves like a wave and a particle. This is how it works:  When you shine light through a thin slit, what you see on the wall behind it is not a distinct line but a fuzzy line. This shows that light is gravitationally bent by the edges of the slit as it passes through, therefore it must have mass.  Now you add a second slit and a second light so that the two images on the wall overlap. The slits polarize the light. If the lights do not behave like a wave then you will just see that the area that is overlapped will be brighter when you turn on the second light. But that's not what you see. Instead, you see alternating bands of dark and light. That's because two waves coming from different angles, as they mix, will cancel each other out in some spots and increase the energy in other spots.   Except that a photon is a particle and obeys particle physics. Its path bends, reflects and refracts and it imparts momentum and force.   Do explain why the IRS is unconstitutional when we have this thing called the sixteenth amendment to the U.S. Constitution, and whether you believe that the U.S. Supreme Court has the power to make decisions on this matter?   They want to get elected and they live in a right wing community.  Edit:  Sorry, that's not a helpful answer but I honestly don't know of any logical basis for their claim other than populism. The 16th amendment to the Constitution gives the federal government the ability to tax.   I'm fine with DIN 8. No knee injuries (knock on wood) and I have confidence in my skis. I'll take others' advices and swap out the bindings.   Even though you don't feel it though your feet, your house is likely passing on the vibrations caused by the moving air that is generating sound waves as it moves around your house.   As girls enter and go through puberty, they begin thinking sexually. It's parentally and socially acceptable for a girl to express sexual desire through a boy band poster and not through putting up pictures of boy classmates all over their room.  Secondly, boy bands are idealized targets of affection. They represent success (and thus stability) so are biologically appealing to girls as they approach child-bearing ages.   Your example is interesting but by itself doesn't portray an accurate picture. Where do you get your food costs? In Canada, food comes from grocery stores whose prices are fairly standard. In Nicaragua, I suspect without having been there that there are public markets whose prices vary greatly with availability and your ability to barter. Secondly, there are other costs to living in either place such as taxes, housing and transportation, as well as the differences in unemployment rates (i.e. the supply of workers which affects the wages offered). The economies of Canada and Nicaragua are very different.   I can't speak for the accuracy of the image but when Alexander The Great and his Macedonian army traveled through and conquered the area, they left quite a bit of genetic material. There are whole villages of blonde, blue-eyed Afghanis and a high prevalence of heterochromia.   Dead reckoning: If you know where you started and you fly a compass bearing for a certain amount of time at a certain airspeed, you should know where you are, theoretically. It's how Amelia Earhart and her navigator found her way around the world.   Good idea.    No offense taken. I already feel tweaks in my knees just from normal everyday shit. The last thing I want is physical therapy   rehab.   I'm 5'7", 155 lbs, 45 years old. I live in Utah and have been skiing for 30 years. I don't race but can ski any resort terrain. I got a nice deal on some Dynastar Omeglass stock race SL skis. They come with PX18 race bindings. The lowest DIN is 10. I currently run DIN 8 and my bindings have never released inappropriately. I'm a little nervous about going to DIN 10. Should I be?      Because the species Americanus Publicus is not considered to be very intelligent. They tend to believe that any action is better than inaction, and are easily swayed by populist politicians who know that the individual members of this species are too lazy to fact check anything that is said.     A photon is a particle. It has mass and obeys physical laws.   Is it true that almost all flowers are flown in from equatorial countries?   Stop flying discount airlines.   God, I miss the old days.   It's interesting this guy said it was painless. I remember reading a story written by another host (is that what you would call them?) who had larvae on his back which he also decided to carry full term in the name of science. He said the emergence was the most painful thing he ever experienced in his life.   I think they're the hooks that the human botfly larvae has on its body to prevent anyone from trying to pull it out. I believe they retract when the larvae starts emerging. Pretty interesting little creatures. I studied up on them after a trip to the tropics that resulted in some skin boils that I thought may have been botfly larva.   Edited for SoCal, Arizona and Texas:  * I mean if they can speak Spanish, that is.   If a restaurant owner gets hauled into court they can make communication an issue. If a caucasian can talk to the cooks, they can have at it.   Then again, being the guy who went and got a handjob in the name of civil liberty might be something cool to tell the grandkids.   Might be hard to find somebody willing to be the test case though.      You are a failed human being if you can't install a car seat.   You're welcome! I recommend "Political Philosophy, a very short introduction" by David Miller. It can be read in about 1-2 hours and it gives a pretty good background for further reading if you get hooked. In one of my favorite college courses we read "History of Political Philosophy" by Leo Strauss.   NATO stands for North Atlantic Treaty Organization. It started of as a collection of western european countries and the U.S. who entered an agreement that if any of them were to come under military attack, the others would be obligated to come to their defense. It's a herd defense strategy and it was done to counter any possible aggression by the Soviet Union.  NATO's mission is now obviously moot. The past few military uses haven't been to defend NATO countries but ostensibly for humanitarian aid and NATO *interests* (Yugoslavia, Libya and Syria for example). Critics say that NATO should be disbanded and a new treaty be crafted that more accurately accounts for modern threats.   If you define reaction as seeing-brain processing-muscle reaction:  The neuro pathways of a fly are on a much smaller scale thus impulses just don't have very far to go from the eyes to the brain.  A fly's response is actually quite complicated and researchers are still trying to figure out how they make decisions when a predator is approaching. It turns out they have a really wide variety of moves and are unpredictable.   @ChickinSammich, thanks for the answer. Makes sense. I'm going to mark this as explained.   They have oil too, lots of it. The profits from the oil are put into a sovereign wealth fund that basically gives everyone an annuity. Pretty sweet but not everybody gets to have oil in their backyard. Damn, wish I was finn. Well, except for the winters.   How quickly people forget 2008.  By the way, Romney promised he would get unemployment down below 6% in 4 years. Obama did it in 2.   It's human nature. We are all guilty of being too optimistic about something. For example, influenza kills 53,000 people a year in the U.S. but few of us go get the flu vaccine.   I don't know if you should just assume the business owner wouldn't spend that money. Even if he just put it in the bank, it's capital that the bank can use to make a loan.   That's a good question. I'll start with some sociopolitical philosophy. A society develops when a bunch of people get together and agree to live by a set of rules. It can be all the citizens of the United States and the rules are the U.S. Constitution, or it can be a bunch of guys in an apartment and the rules are written on a piece of paper on the fridge. For the guys in the apartment, they may all agree on "common expenses" like toilet paper, detergent, dishes, etc. and each has to pitch in $50 a month towards the common costs. That's a tax.  A country uses a tax to provide for the common good:  Roads, military, jails, schools, though you may not get a direct benefit from all of the things they spend money on.   As I understand it, the ACA isn't a the government competing against a business, but a set of laws that basically say you have to buy health insurance, and it gives states some money to subsidize the low income earners?   All debt has a term and the U.S. is always paying off debt as it matures. It has not defaulted (yet). What John Maynard Keynes envisioned was that a country would stop borrowing when the economy was good and it no longer had to stimulate it.   The argument for a capital gains tax that is lower than income tax is because you could lose all of your invested capital whereas if you are working for wage income you won't ever actually lose money to your company. Secondly, you must invest for at least a year before you can realize that lower rate. It's a way to reward people for taking the risk of investing longer-term.  The counter argument to this is that the returns on investment already includes the risk. By lowering the tax rate on one versus another investment you introduce an artificial force that distorts the market.  I inform, you decide :)  	84
 Only Taric can resist her charm...      Angry Bird Heimer?    My Nokia Lumia 920 can do it...   If you hit their upper body it's a oneshot:P    Thats.... Amazing :D   I got 5mbs. If im alone it the house I dont lag, but if my brother use YouTube or Netflix, I lagg allot. I play because I love this game and want to get better at it. Im trying not play ranked if i know i got bad internet, but at the end of the season... I just have to play when i can to climb elo. Sry....   Aww... Sorry mate. I promise it will be in the next one. Ty for the tip bro :D   lol yeah   This part :) Dont know the name in English :P Im from Norway.  http://puu.sh/5eyN7.jpg   Yeah :D Was working the whole summer to get it...  	11
                but to be honest even now not every one can buy big home - so, small could be usefull ;)   you got + from me  to repay  unjustice then                              link to iama: http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/227nxo/i_am_marcin_jakubowski_founder_of_open_source/         Let me quote: "In concentrations up to 1% (10,000 ppm), it will make some people feel drowsy.[84] Concentrations of 7% to 10% may cause suffocation, even in the presence of sufficient oxygen, manifesting as dizziness, headache, visual and hearing dysfunction, and unconsciousness within a few minutes to an hour." source: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_dioxide#Toxicity   You not afraid to fail? excellent and you have practical "feeling" - wonderful. Than I couldn't find a reason why you shouldn't succeeded.  You invest money and you have right to profits if you doing it wisely. What is you idea about growing on your fields?   so, will you try breath with mix of 20% O2   80% CO2  ?  I don't think you can - rising level of CO2 in you lungs would trigger signal in your brain to make you fill out of breath  - if I not mistaken -  and level of CO2  would killed you.     Obviously, it's nothing to be shame about and finished looks really great. What I'm worried about is amount of working hours necessary to spend on it - if someone starting with this business - most important for him is time and money hi must spent on it.   Having carpenter's and builder's experience I can  recommend to make walls a bit higher (if you want to have upper part of the house) and put the roof on rafters laying just on wooden beams fixed to the top of the highest and smallest walls. And use dimensions of standard sheet you going to put on - will save time for cutting, trimming etc.. So, good luck with module 2.   As I remember this guy wanted circa 10k$ for developing this technology - really small amount of money if such profitable industry. Big aluminum companies doesn't use it, that's mean to me building production line won't we easy or cheap and cost of product could be bigger than using imported boxites. If you succeed with this technology you don't need to wary with the many for development others projects.   You forget about all this people with ill liver forbidden to drink fizzy drinks, dude  ;)  But I really appreciate your American sense of humor.  	25
 Drop either Nemeth, Ponitus, or Diaz.   Gerrad. Keane and Zardes can score from Gerrad's services more than Nemec and Villa from Lampard's services.   Soumare is better than Ciman cost wise. Soumare was one of the best point scorers on the Chicago Fire last year.    Yes. It is a factor, but it isn't a major factor of a "terrible economy". "terrible economy" has many many factors.    Because people use the "low participation rate" to justify that the economy is poor. You get that a lot from conservatives. It is one of the lingering factors of the recession as well as the aging American population, slower and slower recoveries, etc. Back in the 1950s, less than 60% of Americans were particapating in the labor force, yet the economy was still prosperous mostly due to fact that we won the war, but still.    That is such a bad way of thinking for maintaining and functioning a society.    The labor participation rate fell during the bush he's years as well. So bush's economy was also in crisis?    New England has a lot of Liverpool FC fans so.....   I mean... If the laws are bad after they are implemented, you vote politicians out or propose new ones.   Lol that sounds like an ad made by Tom Cotton on Obama adding food stamps to farm bills.    Hence why some oppose reforming the electoral college to majority rules or a proportional system. I wish we had a more proportional system.   It doesn't matter because Obama's presidency has been effective at getting us out of the recession. The GOP will probably rewrite history by claiming that doing nothing and mass control of local and state governments helped improve the economy instead of the federal government.   Actually if you talk to republicans, they say that doing nothing is good because it means no bad laws will be passed through Congress.    Yugo is by far the most intriguing and weird character so far.   Does anybody know if speedroids will be introduced into the game and which set?   Max Urruti was my fav for this season during the pre-season, since he trailed BWP in goals per 90 minutes last season, but he is on the bench.   If I had to list potential candidates, it would be:  Blas Perez, Urruti, Altidore, and Rivero at the moment. Still too early in the season to call.     any deck that can nuke the field is good in this format.    I know. people used to use Spell Canceller to side against Nekroz just a few weeks ago. lol   BATTERYMANS!   Really? I think Arc-V's story, plot, theme song, background music, presentation, and acting is better than Zexal's and 5d's.    Karakuri Watchdog mdl 313 "Saizan"?      Casual but I go to locals to see what the status and variety of yugioh community. I just can't play yugioh casually with friends or neighborhood people anymore because they either quit, don't have time, have other priorities, etc.   Any more? :|   Twister, Storm, Tornado, Wild Tornado, Artifact Ignition, Bait Doll, Night Beam, etc  Any more of those?   Yes, if MLS wanted to go over 32 team limit. They would have to create 2 leagues of 20 teams for a total of 40 teams.     Don't transfer all 2 players for week 2 because Week 1 is usually random. I'll wait until week 2 to make a decision on what players need to be transfered out. Plus, you can have 3 transfers to mold your team in the future week.    I have feeling Royal Magical Library will soon be on the Ban List...soon...   Patroid - Look at 1 set card in the spell or trap zone that your opponent controls   Thanks!   Does Green mean favorable and Red mean unfavorable?    Dempsey 60%, but you can always go with Altidore 40% chance, since the few games of any season are unexpected.    He wasn't that great last season too. He is fast and all. I was hoping that he would at least grab an assist in Game 1 since Vancouver does have speedy forwards. He only got 1 point, which was the worst of my team's preformance, so I had to make a cut.    Yugo because he is so random. Declan is myserious but considered an anti-hero.    If Konami errated Vehicroid Connection Zone to "roid" type macine monsters, then Roids as an archtype would be good.    Roids.    I just transfered one player because 1st days are always unexpected. Eric Hurtado for Jose Villareal with some spare millions.  I just hope the ones that I got before Week 1 actually perform in Week 2. Otherwise, I will have 3 transfers to build up.   roids!   Att and Defense Combinations.  The attack points or defense points of 2 or more monsters must equal to a #. The combination of monsters will be sent to the banish instead of the graveyard. The new extra monsters' Attack and Defense are not considered attack and defense points but rather something else? When those monsters attack, they are not treated as attacking, but you can only attack once per a turn?   I think America needs to have a more transit oriented culture and infrastructure in order for public transit to be "privatized".   They are somewhat by releasing new support for archtypes.    True to a certain extent, but there is a point where Globalization inherently eliminates national soverignty and national cultures.   It is concerning but it is less concerning than the TPP.    ^ Basically   Sorry for the wrong usage of the word. Games with no significant influence on playoffs are just money makers.    New Ban Lists are now 1/4 of the year.    Konami wants Pendulum decks to dominate to market ARC-V.... so... not really.    Konami will not hit Qlis because Qlis are a good pendulum deck to market ARC-V. They might hit Rituals and Nekroz support a bit because they need more balance in the game. Though, I wouldn't count on that since the TCG just released support and don't want to lose $$$.  Konami will hit Dante, Burning Abyss support, and maybe Shadolls, so they can add a new archtype into the meta for tier 1.    not really. America will get jobs outsourced from Europe since European rules and regulations are stricter than American rules and regulations. TTIP is more of a concern for the EU.   I consider myself a Rockefeller Republican or a Populist Democrat, so it is hilarious to see GOP call out each other as RINOs. Democrats don't call out DINOs as much as Republicans do, but oh well. I wished we had more political parties though.    I love how Republicans call out moderates as "RINOs". Please continue :)   More meaningless games is just more revenues for the business of the teams.    Ya because 9 strikes to a strikeout was so traditional back in the 19th century. Baseball is not what used to be.   Also new rule changes have always occurred in baseball.   how will you balance the game so it is more fair but still favor new archtypes?   we have a 2 party system with representatives and senators. Germany has a multiparty system with a parliament like system.   torrential Tribute   Hyperspeedroid Dahma   do you live in a rural farm area in the middle of America? o.O   That could work, but that plan must be aided by an increase in the gas tax. I doubt people will want to take the MBTA over the car via the Masspike. An expansion like that will cause no significant increase in ridership because of various opportunity costs. The elasticity of car usage of people outside of Boston and ring highways is greater than the elasticity of public transit usage of city people within Boston.   The real solution is building safer pipelines, regulating oil trains properly, and decrease dependence on fossil fuels.   keystone will help to reduce some demand off of oil trains but companies will still need oil trains to ship oil for medium distances from oil pipelines.   pipelines are only a short term solution and they still have faults. they still leak and companies still need to ship oil via rail in medium distances from the pipelines. What needs to be done is build more pipelines, improve rail safety, pipeline regulation, and decrease dependence on fossil fuels.   Some people outside of MBTA service areas say that they don't want to pay for the MBTA's upgrades, expansions, etc because Why should they pay for something that they don't use?    I applaud MLB for decent changes for pace.   Not really. They are so expensive for the booster boxes.   Magician's Force of you can get it at a good value.   There are half spell and half monster cards. They are treated as spells in the pendulum zones and monsters in the monster zones. Each zone has a different effect for it. They have scales between 1 and 12. You can pendulum summon monsters with levels in between the the numbers of the scales. When pend monsters/spells are destoryed, they go to extra deck. You can pend summon again from extra deck.    I think Pendulums will help vanilla monsters out in yugioh.   I think that the people, who left Yugioh because of Pendulum Summoning, should just watch the anime. It is literally very dramatic and can easily top as one of the best Yugioh Series.   " I love the ever growing game bit many old players just dont want to accept it. " - People said this for Fusion Summoing, Synchro Summoning, and XYZ Summoning.    I don't recommend Zexal. It is easily one of the worst Yugioh series.    I recommend 5Ds because the style of yugioh is similar to the current metagame. Also, the images are better than GX and the Original. The 5D's rock song is similar to GX's theme song. GX and Original Yugioh are also a good series to watch. I don't recommend Zexal, if you just got back. The presentation of Zexal is not great.    True. Sacramento Republic could relocate to San Francisco in the future, if they wanted to.    if you have access to public transit, then it does discourage driving. Otherwise, it is very inelastic for people, who don't have access.   If San Fran were to get a team, it would another in the bay area. California could realistically see 6 MLS teams.... but..... who knows...   Boston University here. Close enough lol   Boston University!! Anybody plays?    Actually, if you rank cities based on population of metro areas, Sacramento is 28th compared to San Diego which is 17th.   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_American_and_Canadian_cities_by_number_of_major_professional_sports_franchises   A Sacramento MLS expansion would essentially prevent San Diego from getting an MLS team. I don't think MLS will have 2 LA teams, 2 SF Bay teams, 1 in Sacramento, and 1 in San Diego for a total of 6 teams of 1/5 of a 30 team league.      The 2 party system is terrible   Thanks! Ultra-Pros do load from the sides.    Are the Ultra-Pro 9 pocket sheets good for storage? The cards do have to enter from the sides. Does that effect how I need to handle the binder, if they fall out?  or   Are the BCW 9 pocket sheets a better alternative because they store cards from the top rather than from the sides?  Thanks for the help.   A higher gas tax would have to be placed so the MBTA would get the riders that it needs   You can be a libertarian and still have moderate views. Nothing wrong, though transit can be public-private partnership at times.   Just keep in mind. A lot of conservatives, centre-right people, and Tea Party folks in Massachusetts have been calling for privatization and waste cutting during this snow crisis to fund the MBTA.    Recently, the T has had a lot of infrastructure problems from the storm, which caused a lot of people to complain about it. However, the real problem is a money and the lack of investment in the system for years. Would Privatizing it help? Should the T get more funding? Should the T cut waste? What should be done?    Baseball has more data and more variance spread out through more games to accurately measure than football, so baseball relatively easier to predict than football.   Ross Perot's voters were from both Republicans and Democrats.   Perot's voters were anti-Reaganomics Conservatives, Rockefeller Republicans, Isolationist and Labor Democrats.   We need a proportional system for votes.   D: I am sad that Speedroids didn't come out in this set. At least we do get Clear Wing Synchro Dragon and other machine support of cybers.   Decoyroid, Ambulanceroid, Rescueroid, Cyber Summon Blaster OTK?   If you want to boost your skill level, you should help other players improve their game.    There are more spells and traps than monsters.   Get the Box early, if you know that you really want the cards for the archtype. Do note that after supply increases, the prices of single cards will drop until the demand, which is the metagame, favors Nekroz. Then, prices will start to increase faster than supply. If not, the prices will fall to its minimum.    Prices only drop in the beginning because the supply increased. The market doesn't know if the deck is competitive or not. However, if the deck does in fact do well, Demand will rise faster than Supply, so they get more expensive.   Box because there is a limited supply in the beginning, so singles will be expensive. Box allows you to get more of them for a better value.    Honestly, they will be on here just to look around, if they are bored or want to know what the fans are doing......    Hello! I am just wondering because I have collected a lot of yugioh since the orginal yugioh. I have a lot of commons, a decent amount of rares, and some really good and/or staple cards. I might trade or sell some cards away to make some few dollars.   What are some good binders to get based on value relative to price?    HAHA! I honestly hope they include Hungry Burger into that mix.   LOL. I wish yugioh made a food yugioh deck. remember the food monsters from GX and Arc-V?   Just joking lol   It is cheaper to buy the box, when the set intially comes out because you get more cards for the Nekroz deck and/or for other decks. Also, since there is a limited supply, when it comes out, the singles will cost abe worth a lot. Don't buy singles, when it intially comes out because the prices will decrease as the supply increases. Buy singles, if you know that market has hit its minimum value. Over time, if that particular deck does well against other decks, demand will rise faster than supply, which cause Singles to be high in value again. If that is the case, just the buy box.   Roids :)   Congrats!!   Exodia   You will make a profit, if you resell. :)   Well in Georgia, highways can have 8 lines of traffic on both sides. Lol   I feel like decks will have different varieties of spell/trap removal. This card works best in mill decks.  	108

 I prefer the imgur title.    Hahaha, I kept reading this title as "Hancock" and was so confused, trying to remember Scarlett in Hancock and why there was supposedly a Janet Leigh interpretation of her. Anyways...      As an Asian, I approve.    I know y'all don't really care, but I'm just going to officially say here on a comment that this is my friend and not me.

    thank you! you can see more of my stuff [HERE](https://www.facebook.com/artist.ruckus?ref=hl)   Don't tell me thats a little Jack Russell. I have [TWO](http://i.imgur.com/d5H00OI.jpg) this brings tears to my eyes. You should do a painting or something and invest some time and make it awesome.      He looks very annoyed that he can't even make nachos without getting his picture taken.      yea but thats not all stencil work. Most of it I hand painted. Tedious work. I'm glad my friend took the picture because the wall was taken down a week later. But the photo lives on!   (Repost, from *persons name*)should be put in the title so the person dosent "accidentally" take credit for the image.   [NOW](http://i.imgur.com/74ck31h.jpg) its a desert with black bananas falling from the ocean sky   Yes I agree, I thought you were already an artist that has done stencil work before. But for leaning purposes your right on when doing it is simply the best way to learn, so it doesn't matter the content. You can feel how the paint and stencil react to each other, thinness in your card-stock, many things that you don't even consider. In the end just do what works best for you. Just because someone might praise one way of doing things might not mean it works for what your doing. That applies with anything really. I didn't mean to come off harsh I just really hate when people take someone elses work, cut it out, then call it their own. Keep it up. If you have any questions feel free to ask. I like to help. Check out some of my work [HERE](https://www.facebook.com/artist.ruckus?ref=hl)   Why don't you be creative and make your own art? This is a Banksy piece and its very well known. When people see it (if they know of Banksy) they are going to just think to themselves that someone has no creativity. Please do us a favor and not recreate other peoples art. Can you honestly not think of anything original?       I don't know why you had to waste your skills with a painting of fucking Miley Cyrus. She shouldn't have anything to do with art let alone BE art. And if you consider her an artist, you need to be euthanized immediately.   The wind ended up lifting the stencil up outside when I was painting it and lost its definition, and the more I tried to fix it the worse it was coming out. So then I was just like fuck it ill blindfold her. You can see her eyes so it doesn't make since but it kinda looks cool. [THIS](http://i.imgur.com/5LDXapC.jpg) is what I was going for. Check out more of my work [HERE](https://www.facebook.com/artist.ruckus?ref=hl) and like the page if you could.      First we bought one plan at our local skate store but it was too expensive and too big. After looking everywhere online I stumbled onto this plan. It was so detailed and perfect for what we were looking to build. I couldn't tell you where to find it but it was perfect because it was just big enough and if I recall just under 500 dollars. But we had a bunch of left over plywood we stashed under the half pipe. So the best advise I can give is try to find something in your budget, have some friends help you, and get all the material before you start. And make sure that shits level. The surface is 2 layers. First plywood, then skate-light or something similar. Let me know if you have anymore questions.     I found a really great plan online. So we started saving some money but my grandma ended up paying for it as a x-mas gift. She also let us build it on her lawn. Shes a cool lady.       Awesome pun sir      Check out my Facebook and see some more art by Maine Street artist Ruckus [HERE](https://www.facebook.com/artist.ruckus) need some likes   Not as bad as you would think. Really fun for some high school kids in the dead of winter.      Holy monkey balls.   Man, your set. Even got the snickers handy. Smart man.   Thank you for that information.   Oh yea and about the strings, I was using my acoustic all day. Even tho I use Erni Ball acoustic Reg. I dont care who you are, after playing all day with heavy strings your gonna loose some skin. If I was playing my PRS, no problem, can play that shit all day. I took a shower after and the tips of my finger peeled off, but that happens to all of us.   Honestly man, if you can actually count how many songs you know then your not as experienced as you think you are. Ive been playing for 10+ years and I couldn't give a fuck how many songs I know. If your truly a fucking musician than you of all people should know thats its about having fun and making music. I don't know why your acting like douche but your ego is far bigger than your guitar skills my friend. Boom.    Man, I sincerely feel bad that this new generation won't grow up with old Disney movies and game boys. And those Disney movies were works of art, everything down to watercolor and sound effects. You know?      Dick^   [Here](http://imgur.com/a/5xOuD) is some pics of us building the thing.   It deserves lots of love indeed. Man, the hours I spent on the school bus playing that. Remember how awesome and new it was to have a lighted screen?   Oh the irony... Kid makes a statement by smashing a PS4 yet just handed sony 600 dollars. good effort?          Where's the fun in that? Fuck long finger nails. If you can get those fuckers to bleed treat it like a trophy. Also acoustic guitars do way more damage. No offence. it doesn't matter how you play it its all about what you can produce. Take Hendrix for example, right handed guitar played left.   I have no idea why I found that so funny. but... just great. ahhhh   A wise man once said guitar is easy to learn but take's a lifetime to perfect.       So many questions... So fucking many.    Thank you sir! This deserves more attention in this sub.   Haven't been able to find the video. It must exist because the pics are screenshots from a video. Maybe someone will find it    Holy actual shit...      Let me let you in on a secret. Most religions (especially Christianity) are a scam... A fairy tail of heaven to make old people less scared and hell to scare young people into believing. This universe is infinite... having no beginning and no end. This means you are also infinite... Our bodies are like hermit crab shells that we shed after death. Have you ever wondered what the afterlife is like? It is a lot like being born. You don't remember because live is never ending and always finds a way. I figured this out over time and through wise people, and I wish I would have known this as a kid like you because once you realize this (and many other things you will come to learn) you will know true happiness. Life is love and we are all here experiencing ourselves. I have been in your shoes but let me tell you how lucky you really are. You are alive and you have a future believe it or not... and you live in a time and place that is a gem in our universe so take advantage of it and don't listen to these fucking church goers. Find something or someone you love and loose yourself in it and always remember you have an eternity to find piece and happiness and believe me son, you will. I hope this helps.

And if you find a discussion out in the front page subs where this sub is relevant, name drop it, even as a joke. It seriously helps. For example, many new users hear about /r/gonewild from someone making a joke about it on a default sub. Try dropping those hints but with /r/gtsim if it seems relevant.  Together we can grow this sub.  I'm still a new mod and I am learning so if you have any concerns,  advice, suggestions, hate, or love, let me know. Even if it is just to let me know about a typo on the sidebar or something.   Thanks, test_subject2027.                                 This happened two years ago. We were having a bbq before a game and he prepared some veggie burgers and I made some meat burgers. He mushed his veggie burgers up real good and it actually looked like meat after we cooked them. We put the leftovers in the fridge and went to the game.   When we got back I was a little bit drunk and was hungry so I opened the fridge and grabbed what I thought was the left over meat burgers.   It was a mis steak.                     This happened two years ago. We were having a bbq before a game and he prepared some veggie burgers and I made some meat burgers.

 Do not bother to read this article. This premier pundit of our Newspaper of Record is only renewing a prescription of placebos, all of which have been applied or consistently rejected through the past two decades of our descent. As Mr. Friedman now meets a popular definition of insanity, his employers should insist he take medical leave from his column and receive much needed psychiatric treatment.      I also reject from the premise of this article. The Soviet Empire was a collection of deeply rooted nations with aspirations for independence. The senile and dispirited Communist leadership had no stomach for the bloodshed necessary to preserve their faltering system  Gorbachev could not be Stalin. The lesser ranks of the regime were eager to loot the accumulated assets of the Soviet State, especially its vast extractive industries of fossil fuels and minerals. A repressive civil war would have threaten this windfall, so they let wayward sisters go in peace, cashed in, and instantly became valued members of the Global Plutocracy.  As has been noted, the Global Plutocracy already owns the USA, and they would never permit its dissolution. Only the clashing interests of the advancing capitalists of North and the slave owners of the antiquated South stumbled this nation into its prior War Between the States. Our plutocrats may squabble over political offices and lifestyle choices, but they will always coalesce in firm defense of their vital interests, which are nearly identical.  Yes, this North American franchise suffers from sharp ethnic and class divisions, but I doubt these can congeal into any loci of secession. An African American insurgency has no viable geographical refuge, and the threat of white separatists is a myth propagated by the Southern Poverty Law Center to raise donations. As for Mexican-Americans, their entry into the USA was an aspirational choice, and they intend to stay within it. As for those three hundred million guns in private hands, mere sentiment will turn most of them against any incipient rebellion  the NRA is not a revolutionary organization.  As the military forces of the USA begin an inexorable retreat from overseas adventures, they are well prepared to retain control of their Homeland. The returning units are expert in counter insurgency, and one patriotic SEAL sniper could suppress any Ferguson level disturbance. The vast prison system is already full, but the reversal of a few court orders can quickly multiply its capacity. Most key has been the creation of a ubiquitous surveillance apparatus; however ineffective it is against terrorist plots, it will provide a backdated guide to all opposition to the regime. Take care, all you Twittering fools, the NSA is always listening. Keep watching the skies, for the silent drone. Will your bug-splat appear on Google Maps?    This is only another ridiculous example of conspicuous consumption by the Super Rich, akin to acquiring a mega-yacht or collecting vacant penthouse apartments. In the event of a real SHTF collapse, I would give better odds of survival to a DIY prepper who bugged out to an off-the-grid cabin, as the surviving population will be prying these dodos out of their vanity purchase of a refuge for a speedy show trial and execution.  The DNA Vault is a nice, conscious salving touch. How equalitarian of our Overlords, to promise the rest of the nuke-bait a future resurrection by cloning. I presume the Hall of Records is to preserve their portfolio of assets for reclamation. As for the Zoological Garden, here is a fictional scene: Following a last supper of songbirds brazed in a white wine reduction, the billionaire went to his composting latrine and wiped his privileged ass with a sheet torn from an old copy of Forbes magazine.    Let us agree that this rip roaring, fossil-fueled civilization is doomed to collapse. Can we sustain some useful, technological remnant of it, or should we acquiesce to pseudo-medieval world projected by Kunstler and Greer? I remember a quote to the affect that the barbarism that follows the fall of a civilization is much greater than what proceeded it and am not sanguine about billions of hominids transitioning gracefully to a hand-made world ruled by Druids. I do care about a few of the people who will inhabit that Future.  After reading the article and the appended commentary, I understand the mere engineering (never mind, the political obstacles) is daunting. I direct your attention to an article in Aeon Magazine, by Lewis Darnell, titled Out of the Ashes. http://aeon.co/magazine/technology/could-we-reboot-civilisation-without-fossil-fuels/ He considers whether we could rebuild such a technological remnant after our collapse, in the absence of fossil fuels. Most pertinent to this present discussion is his description of the steel industry of Brazil, which they largely fuel with charcoal harvested from eucalyptus plantations. As Brazil is the ninth largest steel producer, this is an ember of promise, if coupled with sugar cane derived alcohol for vehicular fuel. My search of r/collapse did not find a prior posting of this article, so I will also post it separately.    From the same dynamic that brought you smallpox, bubonic plague and Colony Collapse Syndrome. Is it possible that hyper-globalism will become unprofitable?     	7
 Just read that you passed! Congratulations! :) Knew you could do it!    Since summertime last year, I have been feeling extremely anxious literally all the fucking time. The past 9 months or so have really been the toughest I've ever endured. I've felt more and more not like myself, constantly worrying and fearing everything. If one problem gets resolved, I'd just move on to something else to worry about. I always feel sorry for myself and imagine terrible things happening to me.   Yesterday I cracked, finally. I just lay down on my bed and started crying. It felt so good to cry and just let it out because for the past 9 months or so I've literally felt like things are building up and I'm just gonna explode.   This evening, I decided that I've had enough. I've simply had enough of anxiety and depression and all the other emotions I feel. It was pouring with rain and dark and I went outside and just did a workout session. I worked up a sweat and just got soaked and muddy. I have to say, in the past 9 months I've never felt so good as I do right now. It feels so empowering just to say "you know what, I don't care about what happens to me, I don't care if all my darkest and most horrible fears become real. I love myself and I'm going to just going to say fuck it, go outside and get dirty".  The funniest thing is, I always see reddit posts about doing excercise and how it changes your frame of mind and makes you feel better but I always just say "fuck it", It probably won't make a difference to me or make me feel worse. But I have to say, I just feel so alive. Now all I want in the whole world is just to keep this feeling going and gain momentum to get out of this rut that I'm in.  Anyways, I just wanted to get that off my chest. To all people who are like me and read posts about doing exercise but never actually do it, please just do it. Just do one honest, hard session. Get dirty and sore, muddy and wet, just do it!   Thanks for reading! :)   You are an evil person.    Thanks so much for the response. Means a lot to me :)   Don't look at it like you need to pass and if you make one mistake you've failed. Look at it like you've already failed and you need to just drive well in order to pass. Don't concentrate on any mistakes you may  make. I thought I'd definitely failed mine but I persisted and it turned out I passed. No matter how bad a mistake, just imagine you've already failed right from the beginning and it relieves the pressure.    Although he was under for long we usually say around 15 minutes is the limit in an avalanche. This person was rescued relatively quickly.    I'm a 19 year old guy currently on my gap year (year break before college/university that we do in England). I've been travelling around quite a lot during my year off and I feel like my anxiety/depression is just getting worse. I never have panic attacks like I used to but I constantly just feel anxious.   The big thing for me is my health. I am always worried about my health, primarily stds. Last year I did something stupid with a girl I didn't know and i literally convinced myself I had HIV. I went and got tested and I didn't have it which was a huge relief. But then at new year i got blackout drunk on a night out and lost some of my friends. Since then I have been worried that I have it again. For some reason I just feel like my drunk self is a total ass-hole who will completely fuck up my life given the chance. I have no reason to believe i got infected, I'm pretty sure i didn't have sex or anything but I just feel like I did something that made me get a disease. I've told myself that I will get tested again after 3 months but even if I come up negative again I don't think thats going to be the end of the problem.  I feel like I always have to have one thing that I'm worrying about. It used to be a brain tumour and then I got scans and after everything came out fine I would switch my anxiety and focus on something else. But there is never a time where I'm just not worried about anything. There is always one thing that I'm fretting over in my mind and it's usually a disease of some sort.   I just feel so insane. I feel like nothing good will come of me and i will end up as a tragedy, dying young of a disease with stigma attached to it through my own fault.  I've never been to a doc or therapist about my anxiety/hypochondria but I'm starting to think I should. I mean, its nearly been 3 months since new years and I am still constantly worried about having ruined my life over being blackout drunk. That just can't be normal. I feel like I don't like my inner self who is revealed when I get really drunk with friends. I have no self control and I just feel ashamed of myself. The worst part is I didn't used to feel like this. I used to love myself and be proud of things I did, I used to be my friend but I just don't feel that way anymore. I honestly look in the mirror and see someone who I'm afraid and ashamed of when I look into my own eyes. I mean how fucked up is that?  Anyway, the reason I feel like I haven't talked to a doctor or therapist is 1: Because I'm always away and 2: Because I don't actually know If I'm having real issues. Some days the anxiety will still be there in my head but I will be distracted, I'll hang out with my friends and feel happy and I don't know if I truly need help or I just occasionally feel "Sad" because im a young teenager with hormones in me.  But every night I will go to bed and while lying there I will feel scared. Maybe of nothing in particular but just scared and filled with dread.   Sorry for the rant I just feel I really need to talk about this. Any responses would mean the world to me.    A tragedy but all these people are good looking as fuck!   Whats the song? Is it from halo?   That was fucking cute.   Yeah true that. I only wrote "Ecstasy of Gold" in the title because I assumed people know thats Ennio Morricone.   	11
 You look super cute in (and out of) that dress :)   Good lord indeed!   Now keep in mind, I don't know any Japanese. I know I can just go to Google, but I want to check with a native speaker because its for a tattoo. Basically, its a series of tattoos based on movies and games that, growing up, captivated and inspired my imagination. Simply I want to get the words "Never Stop Dreaming," in Hylian, and the era of [Hylian](https://i.imgur.com/Z05eact.jpg) I want to use is based off of Japanese.  So if anybody can translate it for me, and also transliterate it to the Latin alphabet. As is my key. I would be eternally grateful.    [This](http://imgur.com/Z05eact) is the reference chart I went by    Whichever one proposes first.      Im in love with your smile :)   You are very welcome indeed :)   I want you so bad right now!

 ohh.  never seen it, so thanks for the clue-by-four.   how much more coffee will it take for him to kill again?   I thought Fox News told me that racism was over!?   praise be to the kittens   Nurse!  Get me some fucking eye-bleach!  STAT!!!   Maria Hill (aka Robin) ?   Too busy causing traffic jams.  /s   Sure.   For years I have come across references from various sources alluding to Adam being the second angel created by God.  [This can also be found in the evageeks wiki](http://wiki.evageeks.org/Adam#Allusions):   *The second book of Enoch refers to Adam as the Second Angel. In NGE, Adam is the First Angel, and Lilith, not Adam, is the Second Angel. However, all humans descend from the Second Angel, whether Adam in Enoch, or Lilith in Evangelion.*  This has always annoyed me because its always been listed without a proper citation/reference.  So, I recently went on a hunt to find out what the real deal is about it, and found a [*Google Books source*](https://books.google.com/books?id=Wgk3AAAAMAAJ lpg=PA40 ots=XmQ3ouHfu3 dq=%22secrets%20of%20enoch%22%20%22second%20angel%22 pg=PA40#v=onepage q=%22secrets%20of%20enoch%22%20%22second%20angel%22 f=false) of the Book of Enoch scripture detailing God's creation of Adam:   [11] And I placed him upon the earth like a second angel in an honourable great and glorious way   [12] And I made him a ruler to rule upon the earth and to have My wisdom  I don't think any of this substantiates the book of Enoch/Adam/Lilith connection.  Thoughts?   and yet you are so sensitive about it.  have fun on the internet!   well, you're taking a light-hearted jab (an excuse to say *anta baka* on this sub) the wrong way.  But I would still say that best girl posts traditionally come with pics to share - promoting a pic swap which almost always ends in a posting of Ramiel as best girl.   a ballroom blitz   Online.   Not sure what you are saying here in contrast to what I said.  I said it wasn't a single shot.  I didnt say anything about it being chloe or not.    I find Time Warner to be the most cost-effective (I cant find a better deal) option for 20/2 mb service.  The service has been good, with only a handful of experienced late-night outages in the past couple of years.  Streaming and downloading has been consistent.  I'm sure others have their complaints, but over-all my experience has been good.  I quarterly check for better deals, and can never find one.   I think we still have plenty of our own specific deaths and issues to protest, before doing one specifically for Freddie Gray.  I think Baltimore has FG covered for now.  LA protesting something on the other side of the country is a distraction to protesting against our own numerous local problems.   I thought that the compass will direct *whoever is using it* to the direction of what they desire the most?  I'm pretty sure this is demonstrated across the movie franchise when other people are in possession of the compass.  Sorry I can't make any specific citations at this time, because its been a long time since I have watched any of them.   Good luck and be safe!   She flipped him.  She flipped him for real.   youtube description says the kid in purple told people in-game how to find him if they didnt like his camping.   ee=yes (in Japanese)  who the fuck starts a best girl thread without posting any pics of who they are saying is best girl?   thats what I'm fucking saying.   /u/TrollaBot test_subject2101   Ee!  :-)  You posted a best girl question with no visual offering to the best girl gods.   Sooo many additional train routes used to exist all over the country.  You could shake your head for years reviewing all of the routes terminated and tracks ripped-up or covered.   AFAIK, its mostly because its non-standard equipment that needs to be rented and operated by a special op.  And yea, you also have the added time of setting up a shot multiple times in a choreographed manner.  I'm not sure what you mean by training beyond that.   its called motion tracking.  that was not a single-sequence.  edit: its so funny how blinded fans can be.  it was a fantastic sequence of action, but you're mistaken if you think it was a single shot - *sorry!*   Tracking shots are expensive.   I've waited for a fight scene like this for 2 years!  This is the kind of SHIELD infiltration action I have expected from the start.  I hope they keep it up!   And he beats his family daily.    FUCKING SPOILERS   then it was just deleted, not a post from a shadow-banned user.   How can you have any pudding, if you don't eat your meat?   ... how do you know that someone commented and is shadow-banned?  By being shadow-banned, you shouldn't even know they tried to comment - no?   wat   They probably have drugs though. Id go make out with a new friend.   If you've been redirected, its too late.   He seriously did this, and constantly drove around without plates?  What an asshole.    I want you to get this fuck where he breathes! I want you to find this nancy-boy graffiti artist, I want him DEAD! I want his family DEAD! I want his house burned to the GROUND! I wanna go there in the middle of the night and I wanna PISS ON HIS ASHES!   ?   Priorities!    a bug is a bug.  I reported it.   There are variations if you search google images.   hindsight 20/20.  But when something potentially injuring you comes at you from one side, you instinctively go the other way.  from the roll of the vehicle, you can tell it was a hard yank on the steering.   A small group of anyone should not be allowed to paint a portrait of an entire community or race.  Not everyone you see being assholes in the news accurately represents everyone else.  Try to see beyond your hate.   Just look at those thrusted hips...   Lord have mercy! God is my shepherd, and he knows what I want!   I dont think a non-american likely understands who our "weekend warriors" are.   I don't see no purple pill, Morpheus.   I could not fucking believe it when I saw it.  There should be a mandatory maximum sentence for shit like that.   Very smart setup given the drawbacks of certain devices.   Nope - its really her under there!   El perro, el perro, es mi corazon!

I completely drew a blank on the proper name/terminology for this issue.    And that doesn't come off as an end-user experience bug?  I mean, as a tech person, I knew how to work around it. How many non-tech people would, without any interface prompting or reminders?   **Example Problem:**  Custom sort order all Marvel Cinematic Universe titles like so:  |Title|Sort Title| |:-|:-| |Captain America: The First Avenger|Marvel 1| |Iron Man|Marvel 4| |Iron Man 2|Marvel 5| |Thor|Marvel 7| |The Incredible Hulk|Marvel 8| |The Avengers|Marvel 10| |Iron Man 3|Marvel 12| |Thor 2|Marvel 15| |Captain America: The Winter Soldier|Marvel 17| |Guardians of the Galaxy|Marvel 19|  **Displayed order ends up being:**  1. Captain America: The First Avenger 1. The Avengers 1. Iron Man 3 1. Thor 2 1. Captain America: The Winter Soldier 1. Guardians of the Galaxy 1. Iron Man 1. Iron Man 2 1. Thor 1. The Incredible Hulk  **So, what's the problem?**  Plex is numerically ordering as 1, 10, 12, 15, 17, 19, 4, 5, 7, 8.  This is apparent in the raw movies order as well as any filtered displays such as collections.  Its numerically linking against the first number.  **Work-around:** Prefix any single-digit numbers with a 0, and Plex will display it in the correct numerical order.  So 1 as 01, 2 as 02, and so on...    fools get drunk and want to compete    slap-boxing in the street    I'll never understand "thugs" with their pants hanging off their asses, starting all their shit at a disadvantage.

The older I get, the more obscure my references are :-)   [It's a quote from Blazing Saddles](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0071230/quotes?item=qt0564101), poking fun at the actress Hedy Lamarr.  [She was not pleased and pressed legal action against the production](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blazing_Saddles#Production).    Is that why you're not giant?    yes...   That's *Hedley*!

Because proper understanding of word definitions are important, so incorrect assumption are not made.   Yet apparently lots of people took needless offense to that.   The proper definition illustrates that it has less to do with the person doing it, and more with the circumstance and context for which it was done.    he means that the "editors" dont do it, which is true.  its a vfx house thats doing it.

Gosh, I hope all those youtube views were worth it. /s   Because it looked like something made at a craft fair. Completely inelegant for the occasion.    I don't have an issue with a critical opinion. It's what hear as a horrible inflection found in many bloggers who cannot seem to curb a condescending attitude that thy project when giving an opinion. It's an audible influence to give further sway that not only are what they are saying is correct, but you should feel dumb for not knowing it.

This is an interesting concept, but tracker lists aren't just about putting a blank line between listings.  Blank lines are meant to separate tracker *tiers*.  Tiers are groupings of tracker URLs that fall within the dominion of the same hostname address - in order of connection preference.

I seriously hope those people wore respirators.   I'm not sure I understand where this effort is going.  Having a directory map can be useful when you are organizing large amounts of files, but I don't see the value if this is for generating a download queue for re-downloading content.  imho this is making more required effort - not less.

 It never hurts too look. And maybe they left some subtle hints.   /u/weaslelord found something interesting over on /r/gaming. Here's a direct quote from his post.  Looks like for whatever reason the Dota site has a countdown built in to it. This is what the URL that the TF2 site is hitting: http://www.dota2.com/jsfeed/timeuntilpdt?time=17%20Jun%202014%2017:00:00[1] (at which point they then do stuff to update the countdown and such). No Team Defense of the Fortress 2 unfortunately. Not this time, anyway.  What he's saying is that the timer isn't contained on the TF2 site but is rather directed through the DOTA website. this indicates that this timer **MIGHT** (and stress the might) have something to do with DOTA as well as TF2.    No one knows. it could be HL3. it could be bread*.  *Most likely bread.   Nobody knoooowssss ooooooo.

No discussions between characters, in a plain white room, no need for food, water or sleep and they don't age, no forms of stimuli whatsoever outside of their own minds. Which one could wait the longest before giving up.   I recently found out that there are strikes in judo. Does anybody have any resources as to where I can learn strikes in judo? are there any dojo's near washington D.C that anyone knows of that teach's strikes?   Alright, can we just end the discussion here? It's obvious we'll keep going over why sacrifice is or isn't wrong ad infinitum.  The only reason the sidebar said what it said was to give an example. It wasn't saying Satanism *couldn't be about these things* but rather that hollywood often sensationalize's the activity's of your everyday satanist.  We could go on and on for years about how the sidebar is worded and whether or not it's dictating what satanism is or isn't about.  So let's just stop here and say we're both wrong in some respects and right in some respects.   thank you. this was very informative.   Changed the sidebar again. I'm starting to feel i've lost my integrity at this point.  As for the sacrifice. Why would satan want an animal dead? If he demanded sacrifices then he would be just as corrupt and evil as any other god. not only that but what could sacrificing say a goat possibly do for him? It'd serve no purpose and the goat would have died for no reason. not even to be eaten.  If you're an atheist and you sacrifice a goat then it's the same thing. All your doing is appeasing yourself and in the process you take a goats life. Hence, something I don't do myself but if you really feel like you have to go ahead.   If there's no sea then you can't base it off sea level. Is it from the core?   I took your advice and changed the bit on the sidebar (I didn't actually write the sidebar, /u/bb411114 did btw)  As for the bit about sacrifice, the reason I don't agree with sacrfice is because killing the animal serves no actual purpose. If you slaughter an animal to eat it at least you have a reason to kill it. Same thing with coats.  Now for sacrificing it to satan lets look at it in 2 ways. First let's start with the theistic ideology: Why would satan want you to kill an animal for him? There's nothing the animal dying actually does for him, also Satan is kind and caring. The animals are just as much his followers as you or I are. so why would he wish for them to die?  As for atheistic sacrificing. If you don't even believe in a higher power what's the point of killing an animal? to appease yourself?  if you're doing it simply to make yourself feel better then you might have seriously rethink some of your life decisions.  As for drinking blood. If both parties consent to it and agree that they wish to drink each other's blood then I see nothing wrong.  	41
 The Big East had a couple teams overseeded, yes. There is no way Dayton was making it to the 6 line. Best case scenario was a 7.   I'm not saying Xavier deserves their 6 (they don't), I'm saying Dayton wasn't in play for the 6.   You should be stoked, it's the coolest thing ever. I went for the first time last year and I had sky-high expectations, and it shattered them   Which would be one of the greatest things of all time, cuz he'd have approximately 97 points   It's a lot of losses for a 6 seed.   Take it up with UCLA and Indiana, not the Big East   They're like the 6th best team in the region, maybe.   Enjoy the Madness!   Fair enough! You guys have a great team, I just think Kentucky is the worst possible matchup for you (lol, as if they aren't for everyone)  I loooove Jerian Grant, one of my favorite players. I have him taking you guys to the Elite 8, he's just so fun to watch   I like him better than Haws. Although Haws is obviously still awesome.   Depends how big the pool is. If it's 50 people, this is a great strategy. If you're playing against hundreds, you'll probably have to get almost everything right to win this way.   EWU's not terrible. You guys are just getting labeled as March underachievers, and are therefore a sexy upset pick.   I'd say you have to get insanely lucky and have nearly a perfect bracket, or pick someone other than Kentucky to win the national title and hope it goes down that way.   Notre Dame only plays one player who's above 6'5", and they have a short bench. It's gonna be really hard for them to beat Kentucky.   Haws is good, he's not the best guard in the country. Maybe top 10.   I've got Northern Iowa. The game is gonna turn on if Lousiville is able to get out and run, cuz they're not gonna have a good time in the halfcourt.   FWIW, WVU has said Staten and Browne are going to play.   This is my diciest pick. I have a hunch about Wofford, is all it really is. I think they'll be able to slow the game down and Arkansas will get frustrated. Arkansas has the talent of a top 10 team. The reason they aren't a top 10 team is because they struggle to put it together a lot of the time. If this game is close in the first half, I can see them starting to crack.  This is, admittedly, my least defensible pick.   They outscored the league by that much because the league was not very good this year, at all.  The wins were by an average of 24.6 points because they weren't playing good teams haha. The best win of them was Stanford, who just straight gave up in the second half. I get you're a Pac 12 fan, but Utah is vulnerable here. Could they win this game, then go beat Duke in the Sweet 16? Hell yeah, they're talented enough to. But they're slumping right now, and they're vulnerable.   Don't trust SDSU. Seen them play a couple times this year, don't think they can score enough. Obekpa being out does make it interesting, but I feel like St John's will win. But that's the beauty of the tournament, who the hell am I?   Duke has a significant size advantage with Okafor against you. 1 of 5 guys.  If you play Kentucky, they'll have a significant size advantage over you at all 5 positions.   And the 162nd ranked offense in terms of efficiency. It's not good enough to beat Duke unless Duke looks disinterested (which has happened a couple times this year).  It's not impossible, just unlikely   There's a certain amount of this here too:  http://dc243.4shared.com/img/0-YPtbQE/s7/13eee3b8430/introduce_a_little_anarchy   SF Austin has the best chance. Buffalo has a solid shot at pulling one, and are well-coached. Wofford is a veteran team that a lot of experts like, but the metrics hate. Wyoming has by far the hardest matchup; Northern Iowa is a better version of themselves.   I heard they lost them somewhere around Heartbreak City.   Idk about that. Bennett is a great coach. I think Michigan State will win, but saying Bennett isn't a good coach is just foolishness   Iowa State.   Yeah forgot to throw that in there hahaha. Would truly be a bold statement if I meant the field.   UNC also happened to put a couple of those close games in the win column, including victories over Virginia and Louisville in the past week.   A good point. Wofford is an incredibly low-tempo team, however, so 67 PPG is not bad in that regard. Call this one a hunch; I just have a feeling Arkansas will get flustered. They have a tendency to do that.  I do think Arkansas is a really good team, capable of doing damage. Just think Wofford will get em.   That's why I can't wait! Gonna be an awesome 3 weeks   You beat them at home. You have 4 road wins all year, the best of which is probably Northwestern. Purdue has a road win at Indiana and a neutral site win over BYU. They do have bad losses, but they happened awhile ago, when the team was still struggling to put it together. I think them being 1 seed line higher is totally justified.   Soooo....you split with them. Congrats? You have 1 top 50 win, they have 4. That's significant.   *in the region   Massively underrated in the way people are talking about them. I think they got the seed they deserved. And they were ahead of Wisconsin btw, they're only behind Kentucky.   Yes. You answered your own question. If you're the weakest 2 seed, then yes, I would like you as my 2.   Based on your resume, a 10 is pretty accurate. You guys have certainly looked better than that at times though.   The edge I think is Gonzaga's height. Otherwise they're actually pretty similar teams. But a lot of people don't believe in Gonzaga in March.   Notre Dame only has one rotation player above 6'5" (Zach Auguste), and he struggles with foul trouble.   If Justin Jackson shoots 4/5 from three like he did against Virginia, UNC can beat anyone in the field. Anyone. That performance blew my mind.   To me, it's either this or SFA/EWU that has the most likely 12/13 second-round matchup.   Not even a little bit. I'd wager that most people are picking Texas, and 8/9 games are a coin flip, statistically.   For the record, I like you guys in this match-up. My post was just meant to be a couple quick-hitters about why people think they could do it.  Devin Williams is a bad man, and underrated as shit.   Losing Obekpa is big, but SDSU just cannot score. Like at all. Hard for me to pick them over the Johnnies, even without Obekpa.    They may not have had the resume to deserve their tourney bid, but they have the talent to win some games.  This is exactly how I feel about UCLA haha. The annoying thing about it is that when they win a game or two, the story will be about how everyone doubted them. No. No one doubts your talent. We just think you didn't earn your spot.   Oh absolutely. That's why these two are 8 and 9 and not, say, in the mix for a top 4 seed.   Good luck! Enjoy the Madness :)   Thanks! I love me some college hoops haha, and I follow it all year. This is like Christmas for me.  Oh I love Arkansas, also just have a gut feeling about Wofford haha. I also think they have a tendency to get a little out of control, and that can hurt them if they find the game close and Wofford hits some shots.  I'd probably have taken Cincy over any other 8/9 seed, but Purdue is playing well right now, and I think Cincy is realllly gonna struggle to score. But they've had a fantastic year given everything they've gone through.   Buffalo takes care of the ball well, gave Kentucky a decent game, and plays with pace. They are well-coached, and have a legit star in Justin Moss. They're not scintillating offensively, but they're not bad at anything.   I'm rooting for it too! The world needs more Tyler Harvey.  Utah is slumping, and SFA is an incredible team. SFA is probably the most popular 12 over a 5 pick, and for good reason. SFA went to OT with Northern Iowa earlier in the year, and Northern Iowa is a team a lot of people think can make the Final Four. Utah has lost 4 of 7 coming into the tournament, and hasn't looked that good doing it. Delon Wright is really good for the Utes, but personally, I think we're gonna see Stephen F Austin take it.    Not without rebounding extraordinarily well for a team their size. Gonna be incredibly difficult, and they really have no answer for Towns inside. If they shoot it well, they might. Otherwise, nope.   8/9 winners: Purdue, Oregon, LSU, St John's  5/12 winners: West Virginia, Wofford, Northern Iowa, Stephen F Austin  Wichita State. Indiana is trending downward and Wichita reeeeally wants the Kansas game.  UNC. Paige is finally starting to play well again. Meeks is getting healthy. If Justin Jackson can keep shooting the ball well, they're a threat to get to Indianapolis.  BYU if they win, Xavier if Ole Miss wins. Xavier is the most overseeded team in the field, and BYU is really good, and playing great ball right now.  Ohio State can win a game, but I'd be amazed if they beat Arizona in the Round of 32.  Davidson could make the second weekend if they catch Gonzaga on an off night, but it's hard to picture them beating Iowa State. That being said, the way they shoot the three, it's not impossible.  I think UCLA will get SMU. Norman Powell is really good, UCLA takes care of the ball, and SMU is turnover-prone. If UCLA stays out of foul trouble, they could do it.  This is the best Gonzaga team in a while. NDSU is good, but man will they have to have the game of their lives to pull this off, especially given the Zags size. That being said, a 15 seed beat a 2 seed just a few years ago by having the game of their lives (Norfolk State over Missouri).  Michigan State. They're peaking at the right time and Izzo knows his way around this month. Georgia isn't to be taken lightly, but the Spartans should be favored.  Providence, Dayton, and OU are all legit teams. Dayton will be playing at home. OU probably has the best team. Providence will have the best player in any game. All three are very well-coached. This is one of the best pods in the first two rounds. I have Providence, but none of these three is wrong (and hell, Albany might get OU in the first round)  I have Nova. They're really really strong. Northern Iowa is also awesome, and a veteran group to boot. Louisville would be dicey. They're not playing that well right now. The 8/9 winner will have a decent shot at getting Villanova, but to me, Jay Wright will coach circles around Johnny Jones or (EDIT: Mark Gottfried, not Steve Lavin. Silly me). Not to mention they're really really good.    Villanova is massively underrated IMO. That being said, I also think they got the hardest 8/9 draw of the 1 seeds. LSU and NC State both have the talent to beat anyone in the tournament.   EWU over Georgetown is tempting. EWU has the number 1 scorer in the country in Tyler Harvey, and shoot the 3 well, which is a great formula for an upset. Georgetown is a team a lot of people see as overseeded, and they have a psychological hurdle to overcome in proving that they won't be undone by a low seed in the first weekend yet again.  That being said, EWU doesn't play a lick of defense and Georgetown's offense is actually pretty good. So it depends how likely you think EWU is to get hot and outscore Georgetown. It's definitely not the most ridiculous upset pick, and it might be the most likely 13 over a 4.   4 percentage points? Are we gonna call that significant?   Best one of these for me was UConn winning it all in 2011.   Talent-wise and matchup-wise, they're probably the most equipped to beat Kentucky.  But Rick Barnes.   I'm hoping so bad for that SFA/Duke game. I think Duke would win but I think it would be amazing   Arizona has completely changed my mind in the past few weeks. They've looked really really good   SDSU to the Elite 8 is crazier than any of those haha.   Kentucky/Notre Dame Wisconsin/Arizona Villanova/Providence Duke/Gonzaga   Not totally fair to say. Washington had their best player on the team still at that point (Upshaw), and were well on course to make the tournament with him on the team.   Why the Providence hate? Team is good.   Iowa is a 7, Iowa State is a 3. They can't play til the Sweet 16.   For what it's worth, that's also why Kansas keeps getting really high seeds. The committee rewards difficult schedules.   60 minutes? Damn that sure seems like asking a lot.   Texas isn't a bad loss, even right now..   Yesss, I read Walden before I read Into the Wild, and I feel exactly the same way about it. Thoreau had some amazing truths to tell   No, no no no, no no no no no.  Seriously there's absolutely zero chance Kentucky isn't the number 1 overall seed unless the whole team gets declared ineligible.   It's just Duke/UVA is a matchup between two 1 seeds that went toe to toe the first time they played and Duke/UNC is the most popular matchup possible in any college game for ESPN. They just really don't want you to make it.   Reason being that you're the only team in the semis that would not create a delicious final for TV   That's wrong tho. You don't have to be stationary.  EDIT: These rules apply to a secondary defender. A primary defender can be giving ground and still draw a charge.   Into the Wild is a fascinating read. People got more than a little caught up in deciding who was right about Chris McCandless, but it's a fantastic story.   We were not all that far away from a Michigan-Penn State semifinal. Great effort by both teams, but the better teams won.  And man did DJ Newbill break my heart at the end. What a player.   This is EXACTLY how I've felt for the past year. Thanks for everything you do Mark. This, this right here? Made me cry.   Hammons has a smooth stroke at the line for a big   DON'T GOT NO TEAM CUZ MY SCHOOL IS SHITTY EVEN FOR D2 I JUST LOVE COLLEGE HOOPS CUZ I GREW UP WATCHING   Only thing in that sequence I thought was out of the ordinary was the quick timeout awarded. Everything else seemed fair to me.   Jeeeeeez eat your heart out La Salle. March is amazing but it can be brutal   Game was won and lost on those 50/50 balls down the stretch. Wisconsin got them and turned empty trips into points every time.  That said, Michigan played a hell of a game   Everyone always throws out hiring full-time officials. Yes, that would be ideal. It's also far easier to do for 30 teams, who can play a maximum of 15 games a night (which never happens), than it is to do for 351 teams in D1. Logistically that is a million times more difficult than a 30 team league like the NBA.   Every year we get at least one great dancing players GIF from college hoops. Who are the front runners this year, and who can surprise us in the tournament and take the title?   Holy shit I clicked on that and looked at the other scores from the day in the box above..Texas was still ranked 11.   They were better for 36 minutes of the game. Team is a combination of snakebit and Rick Barnes'd.   It's cuz he was about to say Longhorns lol   HEY UNC  MARCUS PAIGE'S BAGGY ASS UNIFORM MAKES HIM LOOK LIKE A GIRLFRIEND WHO SPENT THE NIGHT AND BORROWED YOUR CLOTHES   Really? You hung tough with an underrated team that you don't match up well with without your best player and you're mad?  Damn.   Man I love Devin Williams. Keep your head up Devin, you're gonna be a big part of next weekend for your team.   Jumala's saying these are counterexamples of "finishing sentence[s]" sucking. As in these last lines are all quite good.   Just the way the teams are playing right now, Indiana would likely be a much easier matchup.   You should be much more worried about BYU than Indiana haha   This is exactly how I feel.  "Well if I have one game on TV, one game on my laptop, and one game on my phone.."   I too love The Brothers Karamazov! Keep reading the Russians.  	92
 Wow this is amazing even better since you're not a gamer. Oh one thing tho, we never say neckbeard, that's a le reddit thing.   Toxic masculinity. A harmful effect of the evil patriarchy that denotes men as being violent, sexually aggressive, unemotional and so forth. Once again if you had bothered to read my post where i clearly pointed out this view of men is a concept not deriving from masculinity, the evurrrrrrrl patriarchy or men at all. It is a belief held by those feminist who would seek to eradicate the masculine gender role along with all gender roles in other-words it's from the great tumblrina crowd, or for you to better understand it's a made up stereotype which in reality is not factual or relevant to real life issues in concerns to masculinity.   So now that i have explained that to you, is their anything else you would like to know since you clearly cannot think outside of the usual rhetoric you have heard.   Weird. Whenever someone finds the need to explain their ridicule and derision with more then one post it's usually because they have a hard-on and a need to be right. You seem to misunderstand simple concepts, i did not describe toxic masculinity because their is no such thing. I stated clearly not everyone fits into the masculine role and not every lil boy should or will grow up into such a role. You believe i am contradicting myself, so let me clear this up, the masculine identity is one you're free to choose or not choose.  Your concept of masculinity like your argument is a throwback, you believe that their is a omnipresent cultural pressure to force a boy into a gender identity and this masculine ideal. You believe the only way to stop this "masculinity" is to emasculate all those who choose willingly to embrace masculinity, maybe not you directly but those with similar opinions. In other-words you're doing a scorch earth policy when in reality all you need is a scalpel.  The only way masculinity as you believe can be toxic is if masculinity becomes a set ideal or benchmark, in while in the past in certain societies you would be correct, their was a definite ideal of what well defined masculinity entail but like time itself things change, what you consider toxic someone else considers the norm and what they consider the norm i find weird. This is where our world view departs, instead of seeking to better understand the different meaning of masculinity and what makes a man masculine you're seeking to rid the world all together due to a prejudice view of a stereotyped concept because you believe this will somehow free young boys and give them the ability to have even more choices when in reality you're essentially limiting the choices of all the boys who would prefer to simply grab the action figure or play cowboys in Indians because you're afraid that this will once again become the standard or norm.  But now i'm rambling. To wrap this up. Masculine like feminine is a diverse concept both heavily stigmatized and stereotyped, we're living in a new age where women are able to redefine what feminine means beyond the idea of a gentle sexual being who is emotional. Which is i know what you would classify as a "toxic" femininity because it's the stereotype, but my point of view is that instead of trying to destroy these "toxic" beliefs or ideals in one fell swoop we should learn from, encourage them so we can truly understand what feminine and masculine is, so we can begin to understand the complexities of these concepts. Now i probably did not explain this perfectly in you will probably reply i'm right at the edge but i fail to to see what lies beyond but you're also failing to see my simple point which is that some people are not willing or do not wish to see the complexity in femininity or masculinity they are stuck on the stereotypical view in which to destroy it all together.     You reply with meme's. Le reddit intelligentsia i see.  Listen:  1. Reread my post 2. Reread my post 4. Reread my post. 5. I did not skip 3 6. I did not add a period to 4, 4 is not real. 7. Then please reread my post again, get a friend to help you and then you might understand remotely what i stated because it's pretty clear. I never said that would be an issue, i was stating the eventual decline of white men like everything else is inevitable, so saying persecution could never occur is hyperbole.    Masculinity is toxic. How is that not persecution, not all men are manly men with rippling muscles and gravely voice, i don't think anyone is stating they're or this ideal should be forced on all little boys growing up but the idea that masculinity is toxic is an attack on men and a effort to dis-empower us. I don't call femininity toxic, i believe we should support both of them as a way to progress. Only way to provide equality, trying to stop a boy from being a boy is just as wrong as putting a woman into a predetermined and inferior role. Same concept, why would you want that for anyone.   Also while i agree this is a mans world, we run this and always will for the foreseeable future. If you look at certain countries in europe who are trying to remove gender specific pronouns like he and she, force little boys to sit down and pee instead of standing are taking things too far. The idea that men will rule indefinately is utter crap, no empire last forever, if 20 years ago you had told me a black man would be leading the worlds only remaining super power i would have laughed for hours. But it occured and he was elected twice thanks in part heavily by white people, in 50 years white men will be a minority, latino's will probably outnumber white non latino's and we're becoming more progressive.   So what happens to all the conservative christian white males? they die or become marginalized. I'm not saying this justify mens right's but if you don't think it's possible that theirs some element of men out there that are or will be prosecuted you're being willfully blind. I'm not white, christian or conservative but i can see why MRA/MGTOW exist granted i don't really consider them as viable organizations, they're good at pissing off feminist and trolling which is always a nice way to spend your time.   Actually dumbass. That's the definition of free speech, what free speech does not protect you from is consequences of your free speech. By that i mean it only relates to the government censorship. But you can say fuck you, you're a piece of shit faggot to the world and besides being ostracized publicly nobody can really do anything to you.   True but who hasn't hit it and quit it with keira already? post level 20 glyphs are impossible to find plus she probably sells them at 2,000 like the other skingy bastard merchants.

You should do a ama. The way you described why you have this side project/hobby was awesome. I kind of thought you were a dbag at first but now i get it.    This is for consoles. We struggling out here.    Not a spoiler.       Oh my bad ha i figured it out after i read it again.   Also while i don't disagree with you entirely on realistic armor depictions. But this idea of the medieval plate armor being the standard for armored protection is not factual or realistic, armor came in many different forms and styles, the armor ciri is wearing in the first picture is actually viable. While the idea of boob armor is literally retarded because it directs the blade towards your chest center which is a weak point ciri's armor in the first picture with a little adjustment could direct the blade away, just flatten out the main metal chest piece  so a blade hitting it would slide off remember blades are cutting tools, you can't pierce plate i doubt it would even cause any kind of internal bleeding unless he were to use a bludgeon type weapon or a sword hilt http://www.radpour.com/images/stories/sassanian_persian_archer.jpg http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/images/h2/h2_15.113.1-5,29.158.885.jpg  http://cache1.asset-cache.net/gc/163240431-corselet-which-may-have-belonged-to-gettyimages.jpg?v=1 c=IWSAsset k=2 d=KD%2F42JEUoWcwA982iri%2BNKq1ATuQmgF26jI1fxpcZq9JeUM48D5b%2BDhHwxkMJ7xzc7ktFi94fgCz4qrmT8njVQ%3D%3D http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/images/h2/h2_27.177.1,2.jpg      So spent hours trying to find a bloody glyph salesman to sell me some greater glyphs. On my last leg, i decide to say what the hell, fast travel to the alchemist around novigrad, to the north east in the woods, in the graveyard/crematorium the guy who is a wizard in hiding. Turns out the bastard is a magical alchemist ha, in other-words if you back out and go to the "show me what you got screen" or exit from the conversation entirely he switches his inventory from runes to glyphs and vice versa once you get back to his inventory screen. You might have to do it twice or 3 times to get to the greater glyphs but he has them. Best part he sells all the greater runes/glyphs for under 1,000 dollars. In effect making it much cheaper to buy glyphs/runes then crafting them which it already was even if they sold for 2,000 orens. Also fun fact you can dismantle swords/armor and keep the single glyph/rune or if you have witcher gear or swords(your glyph and runes will upgrade with them)   Am i the only one who realizes that most of the dlc outfits are post witcher 3 storyline related in concept?   So explain to me realistically how chain-mail boob armor protects ciri?   No that's chainmail not fishnets.    So spent hours trying to find a bloody glyph salesman to sell me some greater glyphs.

It's not a fact at all. Stating israel was the one who included iran into the axis of evil is hyperbole.    To all my fellow redditors. Iran=/= government, iran= good people who actually hate government. Only people who support government are former revolutionaries turncoats(those who agree with the theocracy) and islamist who crushed the secular revolution.   You do realize that it's not the media forcing the ayatollah to say death to america and israel correct? those are what they state at their rallies. Btw the iranian people are good people but they like israel hate their government. Get it now? see sunni good muslims, but isis bastards?   This is actually so true. It's a shame that not many people  know this but Iranians and the Israeli's along with the kurds are the 3 most secular/progressive/humanitarians groups in the region especially compared to the arab regimes. Yes i'm a zionist shill but i also support the iranian people, i looked up their history with israel and the zionist movement and it actually goes back to 1948, the president of iran "mossadegh" actually recognized Israel's existence and was one of the first countries in the world to do so and the first country in the middle-east.   He was later overthrown due to not nationalizing Iranian oil by the cia, but israel's relationship continued heavily under the shah. Cutting the ayatollah pr campaign crap about how much he loves the Jew's, a uprising amount of ordinary Iranian's actually do care ofr the people of Israel and vice versa. Furthermore it seems this goes back centuries, in the 6th century when the persian sassanid empire was reclaiming territory lost to the eastern roman empire they made confederation with the jews living in israel in exchange for them helping the jews recover their homeland from the byzantines and fight alongside the sassanid empire.   Theirs a long and common bond between them, the iranian youth is well educated and could care less about religious extremism. The 79 revolution was more socialist/communist/anarchist in origin then anything close to islamic. The islamist however just with the arab spring took over and crushed all secular revolutionary groups. Theirs a great animated film about a young girl and her journey as  woman through post revolution iran, forgot the name but it's a great watch and read. Theirs another story from a jewish womans perspective also if you want to see how jews withered the islamist takeover.  Anyway i support the iranian people, i've always felt if iran were to remove the ayatollah, give up territory to the kurds and make peace with israel they could collectively be a force to reckoned with if they ever allied.   A few months back i had a UTI, had a bleeding on the inside(tip of ) my penis when i woke up one morning and pissed, right after pissing i saw blood dripping. Went to the ER, got it cleared up, i later found out i had a UTI, got medicine for that, but my penis still feels... well weird, like it's dry and sticky whenever i attempt to masturbate. I feel pains down there, i have pains on the lower part of my adbomen around my groin, my butt feels tender and in pain also.   Age 21. Male 5'9 320 pounds Black Last few months.

This morning my goal was to wake up at 6:30 it was very important but I got up at 9 because in my head I was saying to myself, I'm trying to remember something it's like my brain has habitually used that as a rationalization tool because it's so uncomfortable getting out of bed,       2013-12-05 00:34:34 2013-12-04 link  2013-12-04 23:30:33 2013-11-04 link  2013-11-30 15:22:00 2013-11-29 link  2013-11-25 22:00:35 2013-11-25 link  2013-11-24 22:47:50 2013-11-24 link  2013-11-21 20:01:49 2013-11-21 link  2013-11-21 07:04:17 2013-11-20 link  2013-11-19 21:21:40 2013-11-19 link  2013-11-19 05:39:57 2013-11-18 link  2013-11-15 21:46:46 2013-11-15 link  2013-11-15 21:39:10 2013-11-15   link    2013-11-15 16:13:29 2013-11-14 link  2013-11-15 06:50:45 2013-11-14   link    2013-11-14 04:06:47 2013-11-11 link  2013-11-14 01:11:59 2013-11-12 link  2013-11-12 06:13:29 2013-11-12 link  2013-11-10 18:33:59 2013-11-10 link  2013-11-09 22:21:48 2013-11-09 link  2013-11-07 22:11:26 2013-11-07 link  2013-11-07 22:10:06 2013-11-08 link  2013-11-06 04:03:44 2013-11-05 link  2013-11-03 01:02:50 2013-11-02 link  2013-10-31 18:24:05 2013-10-31 link  2013-10-25 19:53:02 2013-10-25 link  2013-10-25 16:46:29 2013-10-24 link  2013-10-24 09:36:43 2013-10-22 link  2013-10-22 23:03:06 2013-10-23 link  2013-10-22 16:19:56 3024-20-22 link  2013-10-22 07:02:25 2013-10-10 link  2013-10-19 18:00:53 2013-10-18 link  2013-10-19 16:44:43 2013-10-19 link  2013-10-16 17:47:21 2013-10-08 link  2013-10-16 04:47:55 2013-10-09 link  mother of god            hmm   pc      are you his doctor   Proceeds to lower it towards pants      I have a feeling that he was some what elitist, kindness and compassion were not what he was about but i'm not really sure i have to read more and more to really get a better idea   please elaborate?   My plan is to minimise light and avoid artificial light after sunset, go to bed at 9pm and stay in darkness for 2 hours then fall asleep at 11pm and wake up at 6:30am thus when I get up it's not during a sleep cycle. In the morning I will expose myself to sunlight and throughout the day I will try and get a lot of sunlight while avoiding artificial light.       help      very intelligent, aced primary school anxiety started at puberty and it's severe, ruined highschool grades got below average so damn disappointed with what happened everything else is going shitty, grades, friends, relationships tried meds, counselling, doctors, sleep schedules, natural lighting, better eating, improvement and improvement of exercise ah fucking hell   Before going to sleep i literally feel on the edge if i touch my penis it might cum.  So how can i avoid a wet dream because i feel like orgasms make my super powers go away. Maybe something along the lines of  1. realize you are in a sexual dream   2. stop and focus on something else   3. try and wake up and focus on something else    It was super gross, and he would always do this creepy giggle when he did it.  damn i read that as jingle  now that's fucked up haha   He who fights with monsters should look to it that he himself does not become a monster. And when you gaze long into an abyss the abyss also gazes into you. "Beyond Good and Evil", Aphorism 146 (1886) Nietzsche     - after research realise it's best to sleep on back or side  - wake up with sore throat, dry bitter disgusting taste, sick feeling in stomach and feeling shitty every morning discouraging me to drink water in the morning  - told it's because you sleep on your back which opens your mouth and encourages snoring  what do?   wait i mean dekeritanize - whatever it means to make it less cracked and dry and more smooth, glossy and normal shaped   i wear it while asleep, what is the solution? my goal is to keritanize the glans and restore sensitivity to the frenulum, i'll PM you links to my situation since it was a dorsal slit and those are slightly different   lightly wrapped       Buddhism is just another form of escapism  I've been reading a lot of nietzsche and nietzsche seems to be focused on the life affirming, endure through suffering type lifestyle while buddhism seems like an unconvincing idea of escapism, quick fixes, harmony or bliss.  Some would argue and say that buddhism is about wisdom and a peace mind, a peace mind will lead to better coping with life but i doubt that a peace mind is exclusive to buddhism i think learning to live with life as it is much like how nietzsche describes will leave you better off in the long run.   He seems to be focused on escaping reality and living in some type of artificial bliss. I would say an opposite perspective would be that of Nietzsche, a life affirming idea where people acknowledge the reality they life in no matter how unpleasant and try to live with it, try to adapt to it and overcome it, rather than escaping with your meditation, your lsd or ecstacy or even your quick fixes like instant bliss. One should get up off their ass take life by the fucking neck and be the master and not the slave.   That one comes across my mind every now and then and gets me awake for about 20 minutes then it's back to a miserable existence.  another one that makes me feel great and powerful  "I have no pity for them, because I wish them the only thing that can prove today whether one is worth anything or not - that one endures." -nietzsche    I don't think they could have invaded the west coast. Midway would not have been the first big battle, Hawaii would have. From there it would have gone on much as it did, but at a later date. Lets say everything was delayed by a year, that we had not reduced them as much to ruins by the time the atomic bomb came into play. We had Tinian a year before we dropped the bomb- they would have been dropped on Japan on the same day as it already happened, and the war would have soon ended. It may be that this would have drawn more of our resources from the European theater, in which case the Soviets would have ended up with more of Europe at the end. They could have beat Germany by themselves, assuming that lend-lease went on the same in the new history.

Also sometimes if I'm very horny and can't help it I'll play with my testicles, but not orgasm.  You: i try to re-wire my neurons, so if I am horny I would intuitively tell myself find a girl then  You: so eventually if you get really horny you will be good with women because you are so hungry for it  You: so every time you get horny ask, "how can I plan things so that I can increase my chances of finding women?  You: and if you happen to be around them and you are not feeling horny then you can say to yourself again intuitively -you had a chance-    You: the body will eventually re-wire itself to the real stuff  You: that goes for fetishes as well treat fetishes as you would treat horny urges  Stranger: good idea!

Yeah sort of like,   - ok here i am doing nothing - organisms adapt to their environment - so if i stay here and do nothing and it feels painfully boring it means i am adapting to what is natural  overstimulation comes with a host of other problems as well  	87
 It could definitely (and probably does) cause auditory hearing loss because their ears work very much like ours.  The sonar mechanism is a little more tricky.  I'm on mobile now and like I said earlier, I'm feeling particularly tired/lazy so I'm going to try to explain what I can remember about it (which isn't much).  Small cetaceans have an organ on the top of their head called a melon.  I can't recall what's in it, but it's either fluid-filled or fatty and it's highly malleable.  They use it to alter the high frequency sound waves they emit, which bounce off objects in the water.  They receive the returning waves through ~~hollows~~ special sound conducting tissues in their lower jaw, ~~which is either gas-filled or fluid-filled~~, and this amplifies it for them.  ~~I'm not sure off the top of my head if the sonar waves go from the jaw to the ears or if they have another avenue to the brain, but I'll definitely look it up when I get a chance in the next day or so.~~  The sound waves then travel to the inner ear.  So the loud music probably wouldn't damage the melon or jawbone to produce and receive the sonar, but it could affect the inner ear, which is used for auditory hearing as well ~~I'm not sure about the sonar processing pathway.  If it's the ears then it would, but I have a feeling it's not~~.  Echolocation seems to not be as important as auditory hearing though, which I was surprised to learn.  It seems even less important for captive cetaceans, since their environment never changes and is pretty free of obstacles. They probably learn quickly how to avoid running into the walls or bottom at night if it's too dark too see and don't need to use sonar much after that.  EDIT: [NOAA link](http://www.afsc.noaa.gov/nmml/education/cetaceans/cetaceaechol.php) that has good info!   Unfortunately, there's been a recent fad of having EDM concerts (or firework shows) at zoos and aquaria.  It's really bad for marine mammals in particular, because of their physiology and the construction of the pools that they are kept in.  Small cetaceans, such as dolphins, in particular have extremely sensitive hearing, so much so that they can even hunt fish solely through auditory sound, as opposed to using sight or echolocation (referenced in [this paper](http://www.econscience.org/val/pubs/orca_refs/barrett-lennard+96.pdf)).  The concrete tanks that cetaceans are kept in also act like giant satellite dishes, amplifying and reverberating any sound waves that enter the tanks (best link I could find is a [heavily anti-captivity blog](http://www.freewebs.com/let_toki_go_free/dolphinswim.htm), but this seems like common sense that bare walls cause echoes).  Also, sounds are naturally amplified by water ([Yahoo answers is the best source I can find quickly](http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20100517162204AAyO0TC), but again, it's common sense that the more dense a fluid, the more concentrated by sound).  Combine all these facts, and you have a terrible situation to be in if you're a cetacean.  It's also awful when you have people feed them things that they shouldn't eat.  Allegedly, captive dolphins are quick to eat just about anything, which could be a stereotypical behavior caused by the lack of stimulus in a captive environment or because they are kept hungry in order to get them to interact with zoo patrons.  I've read stories about people feeding captive dolphins paper, coins, and even lit cigarettes.  This is why I dislike people.  EDIT1: I can try to find links to supporting data later if anyone is interested.  It'd be more about the first half of what I said than the last half (since it's not like zoos and aquaria will let outside researchers study their animals to for the negative impacts captivity has on them).  Although I could find links for the second half, it would all be anecdotal.  It's late at night so I'm far to tired/lazy to do it now.  EDIT2: Links added.  Bonus [link](http://cetaceaninspiration.tumblr.com/post/33537138326/cetacean-hearing-music-in-shows-does-not-hurt) of a good Tumblr debate on the issue of noises affecting captive cetaceans.  TL;DR: Marine mammal captivity sucks.      After a hiatus and eventual retooling, Search the City is back and releasing a new album in about 3 weeks.  Much different sound than the previous line up (new singer, drummer, and bassist) but still great!      Yeah, if I had to get mauled by a mystery beast, I'd prefer to be completely covered at the time.    I think I would stop midstream if that happened to me.  Do you know if it ever tried to attack anyone?   Your sister does a great thing!  I'm glad that you and your sister have been able to help him so much.  I've only ever had small pets like fish and mice, but I'm readying a book on the study of animal personalities and it's made me think about many other animals, and mammals in particular, have sets of behaviors that can be as complex and unique as humans.  Those stories you shared were very heartwarming :)   I've seen dogs like him before but I don't know what the breed is called.  He's a great looking dog, though!   I've heard stories about camel spiders and such, but some unknown beast lurking around sounds much worse!   Awh :(  Hopefully the little guy headed back home after he saw you weren't able to give him any more attention!   That's really cool, actually!  Dogs seem to respond to high-stress situations much better than people do  	12
   I dropped my Samsung Galaxy tab 3 in the toilet a while back. All the water should be out of the system, however while the device seems to be fully functional with some input delay that hadn't been there before, except for the whole "ten minutes to boot" deal.     Now this would not be too big of a problem if the device didn't already have a glitch where it would crash if plugged into a micro USB occasionally...    I have factory restored it for the hell of it, it still connects to my desktop and I can access the device. I would appreciate any advice or suggestions.      I will keep that in mind, I appreciate it!  	3
 in a medicine pouch around my neck every day.   My first real job was as a PSW in a nursing home on a native reserve.  PSW for the uninitiated stands for Personal Support Worker, but we in the industry have agreed its more like Professional Shit Wiper.  Im the girl who wipes your grandmas ass, basically.  Of course, I also bathe her, feed her, clothe her, wheel her around and sometimes I even get to talk to her.  Most residents, though, are functionally non-verbal.  Nursing homes provide the service of prolonging a lingering death and over time its easy to look at people with their clawed hands and open, gurgling mouths as not fully human.  The work eventually will erode your soul.   Shit wiping aside, the island reserve itself posed some issues.  On the island, most people let their dogs loose maybe for days at a time.  This used to be pretty common elsewhere but its fallen out of favour the last fifty years or so.  And its not hard to see why when these dogs form terrifying packs.  Ill admit Im afraid of dogs.  And there was one around the nursing home who got to me the worst.   I only ever got a good look at him during the day to see he was a black, ragged thing with one ear almost completely gone, a crooked tail that lay dead and limp behind him and he always seemed to have a new leg to limp on every day.  At night he was much worse.  He was just there in the shadows, scratching at something or another or making chewing, crunching noises eating god knows what.  He wasnt a big one, but the other dogs seemed to give him space.  I could have imagined it, but I always seemed to hear a growling whenever I was out at night taking a smoke break.  I happened to mention this phobia to a resident in conversation.  This man was our golden boy, being pretty much the only resident who was almost zero care.  He could dress, walk, go outside, eat, toilet, and bathe himself: the man had it all.  Oh, I know that dog, hes fine.  But tell you what, Ill bring you a rock from the river next time Im there, he told me that rivers good luck.  A rockd be a good charm. Keep the dogs away.  I mentioned that this resident could bathe himself, but his unfortunate habit was to do so in a nearby river, leaving him smelling worse than if he had not bathed at all.  Id been told to discourage this, but to be honest, I was desperate for a magical rock, even just to throw it at the dog.  We often had staff meetings to discuss making any changes in care plans they are called; basically, the focus was how to change a residents daily routine if they were deteriorating.  Help them into their new, more limited life.  A lot of these meetings were more like gossip than care, plus I was new and low in rank so I didnt have much say in anything which is why I would just zone out.  Okay, lets talk about Roger, my ears perked, Its got to stop, hes getting to a point where he could easily fall and drown in that river.  My thoughts exactly!  We should have stopped this months ago, the smell really is too much.  That water is crawling with all sorts of bacteria and I dont think hes well enough to fight off an infection, god forbid.  There was more talk, but only one verdict: Roger had lost his outdoor privileges.        I was there the afternoon they broke it to Roger and I can tell you he was devastated.  Heartbroken.  Furious.  Heres your fucking rock. he thrust into my hand a small oval stone when I made my rounds.  Id never heard him swear before.  This was a rare moment where I could forget I had a million butts to wipe and actually connect one-on-one.  His eyes were welling up and he quickly turned them towards the window.  Men at any age dont want to be seen crying.  What gem of wisdom, as a twenty something, could I pass to an elder whod just lost his freedom?  All I could do was take his hand, catch his eye and make him see that I shed a tear of my own.  It was the evening shift, two to ten and, for a change, the director of care would be keeping the same hours.  She was more of a nine-to-five, but she took the occasional late shift.  Mostly I was impressed at Rogers self-control for not wanting her blood since she was the one who took his freedom and he knew it.  If anything, he seemed very focused and calm.  I took this as a sage reaction, like a man coming to terms.  It was a very quiet night, very quiet until Roger started howling.  Great bellows of howling.  Howling, howling, nothing could stop him, we swarmed with all manner of restraints to keep him under some sort of control.  He kept going, until, vary faintly, I was sure I heard a howl from outside almost lost in the commotion.  Roger stopped.  No more struggling, no more howling, he just gave in to the staff.  The director of care left early, hoping, I think, that Roger would be less agitated if she were removed.  She really did have his care at heart.  I was taking a much needed smoke break during a momentary lull in action.  The evening had gone from very quiet to unbelievably busy after Rogers outburst.  It seemed everybody was going to have a restless night.  Goodbye um Carol!  See you tomorrow! the director waved on her way past.  She got my name wrong, but I was new and, to her, pretty much faceless anyway.  She made her way across the parking lot in the dying light when a shadow went wrong.  First one shadow went wrong.  Cast by a tree, a large and tall shadow swiveled from the trees left to its right as though the source of light had completely shifted.  A cars shadow leaked like grease spilling out from under its carriage.  As though jumping ship, the directors own shadow vanished.  She stopped walking.  All the shadows were not only moving towards her, they were forming a patch of darkness in which she had a shrinking spotlight.  As her own shadow returned, the spotlight vanished.  In complete darkness, I could hear her screams and the exact snarling crunching shewing sounds of black dog in the shadows.  I dont remember deciding to make a noise, but a whimper came out.  If a shadow could look at you, thats what the shadow did.  If it could smell you, thats what it did.  If it could decide not to attack you, thats what it did.              It should have been a relief for the shadows to dissipate, but all it meant was that the horror of the attack came in view.  In a CPR course I had taken, we had discussed when not to start CPR, the idea being you should always start unless it was plainly obvious there was no hope.  There would be no CPR.  In a stupor, I staggered inside only to be greeted by Roger.  Good thing you had the rock, huh?       	2
 If you walk in public, you have no expectation of privacy.     In Canada,( where I live) the courts have ruled there is no expectation of privacy in our yards.  Else your neighbor would get arrested for looking into your backyard.  I don't believe cops jerking off in helicopters is a reasonable concern.  To answer your question, you have zero expectation of privacy on city streets.   Probably because she kicked him and then he threw her to the ground, which is self defense.  Was it excessive force?  Possibly.  I believe he could have accomplished a similar end result ( her being on the ground) with less force and her face not hitting the ground.  Assault?  I say no, cause she kicked him and he defended himself.   I admit that I'm left a bit taken aback at how positively dreadful some people are online and how they always seem to find each other, so that they can tear people down collectively.  I've been online since 94 and the viciousness has been gradual.     No.  Parents no longer have a parental duty when a child turns 16.  Youth bureau can help, but child services...no.   16 is the age you can be kicked out on your own.     You don't suppose there may be an entirely different explanation as to why the 17 year old was booted out?   Do you have an expectation of privacy in public?    He wasn't sued.  This is criminal court.     It's in the story.  The Fraser Institute.   You seem to spend a lot of time on /r/drugs.  I'm a recovering alcoholic and when I was drinking, my main focus was on getting loaded.  Once I got myself clean and sober, I was able to focus my energies on the actual things in my life that mattered and clearly see the big picture.

 Sorry, It's just that joker fish plot was recycled from the 70's/80's comics.   Yeah, this batman story from the 70's showcases how harmless the joker is! How about the time he cut off his own face, then killed 100's of people to try to get to batman, then tortured alfred and convinced the bat family that he cut off their face? What a jolly jape that was!   I have never seen magical girl series before madoka, hell, the only other anime I watched at the time was kill la kill and AOT. However, I would say to truly enjoy it you have to already be into narrative structure and storytelling, rather than just watching things for action sequences. I would also say it's not really an anime to recommend to kids or dumb people.    So robocop: the series?   It's a 50/50 thing everywhere. Even critics either gave 5 stars on 2 stars.   Kill la kill was also my first anime (other than claymore for some reason) and I found it to be massively flawed and overhyped, especially compared to Madoka magica.   If you're looking for stuff this season,  also look at akuma no riddle. Similar Yuri action to kill la kill.   I think the majority of people just use the washing machine/line to dry clothes. Space is at too much of a premium in Britain to have separate tumble dryers.   Man, What a poser, doesn't even use Ketchup lube on his bacon wank.   Fuck me, I forgot all about that, sorry, haven't been using the ol' ham radio for a while. However, I am deeply skeptical about that Napoleon stuff, Napoleon grew up in Australia, and  Australia was sunk by the whore of Nazareth 22 years ago. Therefore, Napoleon cannot know about the bullshit, as Austalia still hasn't invented Democracy.    Not really, Big breakout stuff is seen by Americans, like Shaun of the dead, but the majority of the great british films regularly released  (and by that I mean once every 3 months) are small products that wouldn't interest Yanks or regular british people anyway.   Brit here, never heard of a washing machine OUTSIDE a kitchen.   TBH I also believe that the moon landings took place on mars, but the Surface was painted to look black and white with Martian Bullshit, the most supple,nutritious  and effective of all the shit.   Edgar Wright-Shaun of the dead, although his arguable first directing Gig was the TV show spaced, which showed tremendous film making talent as well.   Probably professional assassin. She's essentially the most powerful being on Earth now. Can she even age?   Not necessarily a purely Mikasa focused series, but a more ensemble focused series. When Erin becomes a titan other cast members can't really act effectively, whereas 3DMG people can move between and help each other out.   This.  Erin having superpowers massively undermines Mikasa's character development in that episode, and she could have become a really decent protagonist. However, Erins superpowers make the show all about a flat, static character who the audience just isn't interested in   I view as more of a Faustian tragedy than a deconstruction.    I, Unlike most people, think the ending didn't really tie up all the loose ends, such as Rei and stuff. I think an elite 4 spin-off would be a really fun watch.   The Madoka OP is perfect for the underlying show: It's a saccharine glitzy pink opener, but the more you watch it (pre episode 10) the  more you start to see that it's actually depressing. My favourite detail is the montage of Madoka's comic hijinks, whist in the bottom left Chibi!Madoka gets more and more depressed, with Kyubey abandoning her in the end. It perfectly demonstrates how much grief being the comic relief would cause you.   Don't sweat it, I already did a much larger comment reply or r/anime:   I started watching it pretty much immediately after Kill la kill, and it doesn't hold up well in a character department. The characters in Kill la kill (and Madoka magica, which I watched after getting bored of AOT) are magnetic, genuinely entertaining characters, whereas I only really cared about Misaka in AOT, because she's way more interesting than the protagonist. I also found the battle of Trost to be ridiculously overdrawn, full of filler, and poorly paced within it's own arc and the general series (Erin fights, and nearly defeats, the colossal Titan in the first episode of the arc with barely any fanfare, the political intrigue, and royal guard/expedition force stuff should have been well before the battle of Trost) I also feel that AOT is really unable to provoke 'the feels' in me, because I've seen the 'Mother dies in front of protagonist's eyes' trope so many times in comicbooks, as well as Mikasa's backstory and charactrer being similar to Claymore backstories. (the only other anime I ever watched) I also really didn't feel threatened by the Titans, as the 3D manouvre gear made every character spider man (Very little is shown to make it seem like the gear is ineffective other than dialogue, such as an apparent 1/5th of forces dying during a simple distraction detail)   I don't however, think it's terrible, and it is a good show. I'm just baffled why it's the show everyone tries to convince non-anime people like me to see, when Madoka magica is IMO a masterpiece.   Whilst I value your sense of social justice,the term Ladyboy is used to refer to a subculture, and, as far as I'm aware, isn't campaigned against by members of that subculture.   Watching AOT now, and I have to say, compared to my other two most recently watched animes, kill la kill and Madoka magica, it's quite hideously overrated IMO.   I don't know, the thing is, we have NO context for that shot, both in-universe and outside it. It could be one animator who decided to add it, it could have been the majority consensus to put it in. It is also a fairly blatant bit of fanservice/pandering and in my opinion, was a massive mistake.   I was mainly talking about how the Makogoori ship essentially implies that the entire series was about Gamagoori working up the courage to ask Mako out. I think the main reason people think Makogoori 'won' is that after the episode premiered, that ship was **dead** without that ONE PANEL in the credits (which I would also points out, means that we never get to find out what the E4 did after the events of the show) Ryumako would pretty much undoubtedly be canon (other arguments would be called heteronormativity to a much greater extent than the current norm) so when people found that image, many on the second viewing, Makogoori 'rose from the ashes.' People started making comics, and the rest is history.   I just find it weird how there's so much fanart of Mako/gamagoori that necessitates Mako acting out of character to work properly. The only character that Mako has had any interest in ever has been Ryuko, who is, contrary to popular belief, the main character of the story. I don't think Makogoori is unwarranted, but it is far from canon.     The dismal Jesters, Imagine a more adult version of the yogpod.   Ryumako, because apparently it's TOTALLY NOT CANON GAMAMAKO FOREVER GUYZ\???!!!!   So one of my favorite movies of all time is Scott pilgrim vs The world, I personally think it was another Directorial masterpiece from Edgar Wright. It was also highly critically acclaimed. However, whenever I ask anyone about it in my School,be it jocks, nerds, whoever, they all unanimously hate it. (and, surprisingly, have seen it) So I ask of you, what film do you, and the general fanbase love but everyone you ask about it seem to hate?   I think AOT is actually more disconcerting than Madoka magica, at least for me, as Madoka magica is a deconstruction of the surrealism associated with the Anime Genre, whereas AOT relishes that same Anime Surrealism. Madoka magica is also  better written, at least from my perspective  However, my perspective may well be unusual, as I was already a massive hipster/nerd, with a full knowledge of tv tropes. I would also like to say that from a perspective of ignorance, AOT is definitely a more appealing show to males.   I started watching it pretty much immediately after Kill la kill, and it doesn't hold up well in a character department. The characters in Kill la kill (and Madoka magica, which I watched after getting bored of AOT) are *magnetic,* genuinely entertaining characters, whereas I only really cared about Misaka in AOT, because she's way more interesting than the protagonist. I also found the battle of Trost to be ridiculously overdrawn, full of filler, and poorly paced within it's own arc and the general series (Erin fights, and nearly defeats, the colossal Titan in the first episode of the arc with barely any fanfare, the political intrigue, and royal guard/expedition force stuff should have been well before the battle of Trost)    I also feel that AOT is really unable to provoke 'the feels' in me, because I've seen the 'Mother dies in front of protagonist's eyes' trope so many times in comicbooks, as well as Mikasa's backstory and charactrer being similar to Claymore backstories. (the only other anime I ever watched) I also really didn't feel threatened by the Titans, as the 3D manouvre gear  made every character spider man (Very little is shown to make it seem like the gear is ineffective other than dialogue, such as an apparent 1/5th of forces dying during a simple distraction detail)   I don't however, think it's terrible, and it is a good show. I'm just baffled why it's the show everyone tries to convince non-anime people like me to see, when Madoka magica is IMO a masterpiece.    The first 3 episodes of attack on titan are probably the best of the first half of the season. After that it's essentially one massive drawn out battle.   Don't forget Makogoori shipping that necessitates Mako acting out of character!    But it's also mentioned that the escalation of Kaiju threat made nukes massively inefficient, hence the creation of the jeagers. I can see why you didn't like the movie, but that's really not a plot hole.    It explains in the movie that they tried to Nuke the rift but it didn't work, hence why the main plot of the movie is to Nuke the rift from the inside.   There still doing videos of the alpha on winterkewls page.   For the first few seconds I actually thought this was another look at yogventures.   Ragyo being an evil rita repulsa style character is one of the reasons I find Nui, Satsuki and arguably Rei, to be better antagonists. Those characters felt like they had actual intentions motivations and personalities other than being over the top evil.   Nah, episode 9's already fucking broken me, and I mean, legitimately broken me, I've been depressed for days.   In the 90's, but now he's been thoroughly replaced by Deadpool/Iron man, which is why it baffles me Fox is yet to make a deadpool movie. Tv tropes actually has a page about it [here] (http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WolverinePublicity)   The thing with Scott pilgrims ending is that the ending to the comic hadn't been written yet, and a lot of the context to the comics ending comes from the 5th and 6th books, which were not available during the movies production stages. The ending to the film was also meant to have scott end up with Knives instead, but it didn't test well.   Yeah, that sort of thing, as I've mentioned in previous threads as well, Inamuta has no real compulsion to be Satsuki's lackey other than power, and now that's gone, I thought you could add some cool character conflicts.    Just wondering, because people are building up the competition between it and black bullet.   essentially, if there was a season 2, I would personally like it to be more character based, as there's a **lot** of potential for personal conflicts after the series end, but that's just me.   I don't think a S2/sequel movie is that difficult to write for, particularly with the large number of loose ends left by the end of S1. I'm not saying it's a definite, but unless the OVA is extremely dense with material, you could potentially really easily find interesting angles for more content. That said, Senketsu is definitely dead.   Why not Akuma no riddle? That's in this season and has themes from kill la kill doesn't it?   It would be really cool for her to turn up like this in season 2, and completely in character. Nui could just turn up as a school girl, acting innocent, and Ryuko would be essentially powerless to act, would provide great drama.   I started watching attack on titan and finishing some promotional ideas for my own webcomic. However, AOT left me frustrated (It doesn't have the same emotional resonance for me as for others, I get no feels, I also don't like Eren as a character) so I started watching Madoka, and I think it's an astonishingly good series.   Holy shit! I just finished watching Madoka magica today (but not rebellion, no spoilers) it was a freakin' masterpiece!   Satsuki is genuinely a fascist, and is planning to take over the world, aware that with the life fibres gone, nudist beach is the only military left.   Pretty much, way more overpowered than superman. Wonder woman is also a better fighter than superman, and has a whip that compels people to tell the truth. Green lantern is also arguably more powerful, as he can construct any of his minds desires, and can ask for help from the green lantern corps, GL also knocked out **batman** in one punch. Batman has also been shown to consistently kick supermans ass.   Actually, In the Justice league comics, Superman is genuinely one of the weakest links on the team, any supervillain who outstrips superman in strength (and they all do, even lex luthor in his battle armor) will knock superman around for most of the fight. A MUCH bigger problem for the movies is the flash, who is ridiculously overpowered in a team setting.   Wasn't it THEN explained that it DEFINITELY WASN'T a doombot? Like, specifically by the editors?   TBH she doesn't break the marvel universe as much as people think, because the sentry is essentially squirrel girl played straight. You really could just explain away her powers as her being a reincarnation of the sentry/phoenix force.    I would totally watch a great lake avengers movie.   So Duncan, who the majority of people think did significantly better than zoey and Hannah, will get -14 points? seems a little harsh.   To be fair, if you want to be *really* specific the latest series revealed that he doesn't have Schizophrenia or split personalities, and his mind is actually trying to reconcile the interpretations of an alien consciousness, which mankind has viewed as the Ancient Egyptian God, Khonshu  **Comics are weird**   He has a new series out now, so it's a great jumping on point.   Makes me really want a moon knight movie. Moon Knight is essentially a combination of Rorscach and batman with added schizophrenia, plus, he exists in the marvel universe, so he once imagined Spider-man, wolverine and captain America were his split personalities.   All anime is also based of western culture after WW2, so technically this is a American take on the japanese take on the american take on the japanese take on Sci FI and martial arts.   KLK is set in a dystopia, but it's never explored, which would be an interesting direction for season 2.   Copied from my comment on a previous thread:  Season 2 would focus around a spec ops's style team, composed of Satsuki, Tsumugu, Uzu, Inamuta and nonon, trying to dismantle Revocs, which is now under the control of Rei, who is attempting to bring about the return of the live fibres (Sorry to Gamagoori fans, but if he was in the series people would focus way too heavily on his character, and, due to the season finale, we know there's no danger to him, also, the season would become about Mako/gamagoori shipping again) Ryuko and Mako don't appear, leaving their lives ambiguous. The show would be scaled down from kill la kill, having more grounded action and more characterization, as the life fibers have been destroyed, (comic relief is kept up by bickering, as is the hectic animation) therefore, the series focuses on Tsumugu and Satsuki making elaborate, batman esque plans, and having them usually horribly fail due to bickering and infighting, however, there are clear character arcs and motivations that the characters can undergo, further expanding and elaborating on the core series:   *Satsuki has to reconcile her current life as the 'good guy' with the fact that she was essentially a fascist dictator, and killed innocent people to create a gambit that didn't work   *Tsumugu finds out more about his sister, his reasons for joining nudist beach, and his relationship with his allies, who he has been trained to hate.   *Inamuta becomes generally more developed, taking a more active role in the narrative. He also has the most neutral backstory, since he never really swore the loyalty the other had for Satsuki. He may turn heel.   *Nonon has to deal with her spoiled, rich girl attitude in relation to the others selflessness, she also potentially has feeling for another team member   *Uzu has to deal with his self inflicted social isolation from the other team members, as well as essentially being  the dumb muscle. Can possibly have a quest for a rematch against Ryuko.   *In general, the series could do lots of world building, particularly around what cause the world of Kill la Kill to get as screwed up as it is. Furthermore, halfway through the series, Nui turns up alive, meaning the team has to deal with who would essentially be the most powerful being on the planet as regular humans. Alternatively, Nui turns face, meaning the rest of the team has to deal with their suspicion of her. I genuinely think a series all about badass normal pragmatism would be really cool, but maybe that's just me.   The demoman grenade launcher has 6 barrels because they originally intended for it to fir 6 shots per clip, a better example would be the soldier not having a finished reload animation for most rocket launchers, and just slapping the barrel instead.   Dwarf fortress. It's the most complex city builder an you know it. It was also popular in the other threads.   Welcome to the world of unexplained plot threads left hanging for a possible next season!   See Ryumako shippers! It's totally, indisputably  canon now, as is Guts/Mako's mom   Didn't Lewis win the livestream games because Duncan made the same spaceship part twice by accident?   UZU/RYUKO SHIP MILDLY VALIDATED!   My favorite episode. (or at least my most fondly remembered) Contrary to popular opinion, I think this episode does the most to establish the world of Kill la kill, a brutal, oppressive and violent social class system. It's almost a shame that the show later on removed most of the fascist, apocalyptic stuff in favor of straighter Good vs evil fights.   Man, I feel weird having found the second game pretty easy. Oh well.   But then it would just be bayonetta 3, and KLK doesn't really have many large enemies. I just think it would work better with handdrawn sprites, which 2D fighters allow.   There are more developed elite 4 backstories in the manga.   The only way KLK could work as a game is Persona 4 arena/ Jrpg style, however, I've had a fairly good Idea for season 2:  Season 2 would focus around a spec ops's style team, composed of Satsuki, Tsumugu, Uzu, Inamuta and nonon, trying to dismantle Revocs, which is now under the control of Rei, who is attempting to bring about the return of the live fibres (Sorry to Gamagoori fans, but if he was in the series people would focus way too heavily on his character, and, due to the season finale, we know there's no danger to him, also, the season would become about Mako/gamagoori shipping **again**) Ryuko and Mako don't appear, leaving their lives ambiguous. The show would be scaled down from kill la kill, having more grounded action and more characterization, as the life fibers have been destroyed, (comic relief is kept up by bickering, as is the hectic animation) therefore, the series focuses on Tsumugu and Satsuki making elaborate, batman esque plans, and having them usually horribly fail due to bickering and infighting, however, there are clear character arcs and motivations that the characters can undergo, further expanding and elaborating on the core series:  *Satsuki has to reconcile her current life as the 'good guy' with the fact that she was essentially a fascist dictator, and killed innocent people to create a gambit that didn't work   *Tsumugu finds out more about his sister, his reasons for joining nudist beach, and his relationship with his allies, who he has been trained to hate.   *Inamuta becomes generally more developed, taking a more active role in the narrative.

Alternatively, Nui turns face, meaning the rest of the team has to deal with their suspicion of her.   I genuinely think a series all about badass normal pragmatism would be really cool, but maybe that's just me.    Dwarf fortress Sips  PLS YES   Exactly, I thought the last couple of episodes as a whole focused way too much on giving the fans what they want rather than a satisfying narrative conclusion.    Exactly. Satsuki is really out of focus in the finale/discussion, because the shipping takes over the show.   Whilst I don't think of it as a 'huge milestone.' I do think it make the most sense within the context of the story. But because of that one Gamagoori still, everyone what would have been a sweet ending into a flame/shipping war. They could have just had a nice 'believe what you want to believe' ending,but now we have this petty shipping spat completely throwing the focus off Satsuki and Ryuko.   I Kind of think the OVA will put Rei in the spotlight. She will either be the 'bonus boss' or there'll be a season 2. She's too much of a loose end.   This was a weird direction for Shadow of Israphel episode #43 to go.   People saying there's nothing there really is just plain ignorance, there really is NOTHING disproving the RYUMAKO relationship.   I've never read, or have been interested in Kotaku, however, after hearing people talk about how bad it is on my beloved DTOID, I thought it was hyperbole, surely no website can be as bad as they say kotaku is? However, this is one of the most poorly researched, slanderous pieces of 'news' I've ever read. Tabloid level journalism, and blatantly ignores the fact that Ryuko sticks a syringe in her arm, meaning, even IF this article had any kind of point to make, it would be based on a false assumption.   Here's a slightly easier to understand version of the story: (http://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/AdrielWallick/20140331/214258/Lets_talk_about_accountability.php)   Essentially it was a simple polaris 'event' that became hideously overproduced when sponsors such as mountain Dew, and one particular asshole called Matti, got involved, it was basically a horrible experience for a multitude of people, and a huge waste of money for maker studios.   Maker studios created it's biggest event ever, costing over $400000, featuring all of it's major stars and big devs from the indie scene, however, due to the ignorance of marketing execs, and general bureaucracy, ot ended in dismal, unsalvageable failure, and is a testament to the perils of overproducing simple youtube concepts      Y'know, I always wondered why the mods don't do more stuff on the subreddit's they create.       Now I know.   Doesn't really make that much sense, they're both obviously just title sequences, which don't follow narrative requirements like points of view. OP 2 also logically can't be from Satsuki's POV, as she wasn't a good guy when it started airing.   Yeah, but the flaming has gotten pretty bad now, particularly as the Ryumako camp feels pushed into a corner, I think it was a bad decision to leave it this ambiguous.   Guardians of the galaxy says hello.   Said Yween, behind a wall holding flowers.   Nui is, in my opinion, the best character to come out of kill la kill. That kind of "I don't give a shit" dynamism and pragmatism are some of my general favorite character traits.    But I'm not in the ryumako camp (I assume calling it makogoori was a mistake) I'm just viewing it objectively, yes, Mako uses hyperbole and analogy, but if the imagery is of a romantic date whilst describing a date, I think she's talking about a romantic date. For example, when people talk about the xenomorth bit in ep 17, when  she uses that imagery we assume she's talking about an actual alien from the context and imagery, rather than assuming she's talking about an illegal alien. I would also point her trying to psyche Ryuko up implies even more she was talking about a romantic date. However, I also concede that the ending is till to ambiguous to judge until the OVA.    I really wish the ending was less ambiguous on this stuff, the speculation is ruining the community.   But in the context of that scene, it was clearly a spontaneous thing, and  it obviously didn't feature Satsuki in the description. Plus, if you use visual description, mako showed the date with romantic connotations, whilst I'm not invalidating Gamako, I genuinely think the ED didn't show the date In question.   Mako being all over Ryuko's body is Yuri, whether played for laughs or not. The ending has essentially separated the fanbase into have's and have not's, and, because neither side has conclusive proof, and neither side has conclusive rebuttal, people are resorting to stupid slurs.   Yeah, It was spoiled for me before I wrote the thread, I've been sarcastic. Basically I start with dark anime on Mondays, and then it gets lighter from there.   Since the academy is underwater, and the characters seem to have been re-adjusted (satsuki getting a haircut etc.) I think it's not the pivotal 'date' Ryuko keeps talking about in the climax.   Thanks brah! I'm totally hyped for watching episode 3! It sounds great!   Whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaat?????? I thought it was super happy fun times with the magical girls?   Why would Ragyo care what gender something is? She only cares about helping life fibres spread in the universe.   I've been given you counter arguments this entire time! Let me summarize:   Having smaller Breasts means nothing, she has breasts, full stop, she's even shown nude in one scene which was explicitly not in Ryuko's head, it's about as relavent as saying nono or Rei is a boy, it's ludicrous.  The boy disguise is just that, a disguise, a major piece of foreshadowing in that episode was her appearing in a female bathroom.  Ragyo has shown no indication that she needed a boy, and also no indication that she personally sees nui as a daughter, and Nui was conceived out of life fibres.  Basically, none of that 'evidence' holds any water. Give up.   The evidence isn't there, nothing you've presented is evidence, at all. It's all subjective.   Episode 13, NUI, whilst still disguised as a boy, appears in a female bathroom cubicle, foreshadowing the disguise. Why does Ragyo want her to be a girl? Ragyo doesn't even see her as a daughter   A rocksteady Moon Knight game.  	104
 Totally agree with you on that.   I didn't say she praised the movie.I said she praised the script.I read that she said it was a wonderful script and she just had to act in it.   Djokovic  	3

There will always be an opposition party, might not be the one we have now, but there are too many wedge issues for the U.S. to ever be a one party state.         You looked at 11 months worth of my posts after I made a comment on your post? How long did that take?      But this isn't about race.   Hundreds.   Nobody liked it when I posted either.

A Conservative oriented website using an add generator produced by an infamously liberal corporation as its primary funding source sounds like a bad business model. Maybe they should have used an add generator produced by a conservative corporation as its primary funding source. Are there any of those? And if not, why?

Feltner voted for a previous Democratic president, Bill Clinton, but now says: "I will vote for anybody against Obama.

One of the sure signs that you live in a dictatorship is when you announce where, and when, you intend to trespass on government controlled land, and invite the press to document it, and jack-all happens.    Remember how shocked they were that homeless people had cell phones?   The President would have to nominate a successor and then the Senate would have to confirm or reject that nominee, if rejected the President would have to name another nominee but the Standing Rules of the Senate allows one or more Senators to prevent a motion from reaching a vote on the Senate floor.

Sports medicine professional here. Emesis in football is actually more common then you think, but not at the professional level. Do you see the way his head jerks slightly right before emesis? It almost looks like a double take. This is known as the "Callaway" sign, it signifies emesis is likely about to occur. The anatomy goes like this: due to the strange squatting position and repeated supination and flexion of the dominant arm, the esophagus is repeatedly retracted into the fundal gastric region. This stimulates baroreceptrors in the pouch of douglas. Sort of like how tickling makes you laugh, it is completely idiological. But the reason this occurs to pros less often is they don't pull your leg. Sorry. All BS. Not a professional, I just know fancy words.  	4
 I think the Joker looks down on anyone who loves him.          Hey guys,   I have to agree with apathy and uber in that I really enjoyed it, and found it moving on a number of levels.

 NorCal here, stuck with DigitalPath.  It's either that or Frontier where I live.   RIP in peace, Big Stick.    Citizens should get to use the newly built DMV facilities across the state.  They can.  Absolutely nothing in the article you linked says that facilities are off-limits to legal citizens, just that they were built in response to an expected increase in demand.  There are *NO* immigrant-only DMV facilities.    Along with some less than beautiful clear-cuts.    IIRC, the Feds closed the land in the 80s/90s, shutting down the timber industry.  The "timber industry" is doing just fine, including cutting on public lands.  They just have good anti-government PR that has everyone convinced that those poor, poor multi-billion dollar companies are struggling to get by thanks to the evil federal government.  The real fight is competition with cheaper foreign lumber.    China isn't expansionist, aside from Tibet.   Russia, Vietnam, India, South Korea, Japan, and the Philippines would beg to differ.   That's right, we can't.  You being a prime example.   Yeah, we pretty much got this one.   Have some liquor ready.  It's Valentine's Day - way ahead of you.   Eh, the Burkes are pretty capable in that regard, equipped almost identically to the OHPs.   No, because it actually makes sense.   The way the weather's been in NorCal the past month or so, it could easily be in the '60s in the daytime.   I honestly don't remember.  I was born in '78, so he was Governor for most of my childhood, and I thought of him as Governor Marmaduke.    We could use another Pete Wilson,  No one could use another Pete Wilson.    George Deukmejian  Wow ... there's a name I haven't heard in a while.    Mccain and Romney were heirs apparent?  They've both sort of made a career out of running/possibly running for President.    Patrick Willis for the next 5 years as well?  He just turned 30 a couple of weeks ago, and ILBs seem to have a pretty long prime for some reason.    a dismal performance by the RN in my opinion.  Somewhat better flying and munitions handling by the Argentines, and it would've been a hell of a lot worse.  The RN got off easy, considering the opportunities the Argentines had to really wreck that fleet.   But ... but ... you aren't /u/silence_hr!   Fiberglass would work.   It's Kings Creek Meadow, a pretty popular spot for pictures.   Olympic is fine.  But a pump sprayer is going to take you just as long as a roller, if not longer, and won't apply as well - it tends to stand on the surface a bit instead of working in.  You're better off just biting the bullet and investing the time in rolling.   Any Malazan army, really.  They have a tendency to get wiped out in short order (while giving even worse than they get, of course).   You must be very drunk to have things so backwards.  See, I'm the guy providing evidence.  He's the guy making unsubstantiated assertions.   Colin Kaepernick was somewhat of a mess in 2014, with his inconsistency becoming problematic as his numbers dropped across the board despite a lot of support on both sides of the ball.  Ah, yes, that support that included about seventeen third-stringers, an OC that play-called with a Ouija board, and a formerly All-Pro Tight End that acted like he was out for a morning stroll once the ball was snapped.    I really like watching Aaron Rodgers lose.  So you enjoy watching the 49ers win?    Am I reading this wrong or is the US listed as zero war casualties?  The map seems to be about *where* the deaths occurred, not the country-of-origin of the people doing the dying.  That's why South Korea has so many, I suppose.     I believe the University is made up of more than just the arcanum.   This is correct - it seems a lot of students are there to study more academic fields from the best teachers the Four Corners has to offer.  It seems that Simmon originally went to the University for exactly this sort of education, and Kvothe at first pretends to Threpe that's what he's there for.   Two weeks later, let me say that that's exactly the sort of thing I'm looking for.  I followed to another video of his where is seriously sounded like he was playing three damned tunes at the same time.  *That's* the kind of music Rothfuss writes about.   I'm not the one espousing conspiracy theories.   There are a few anecdotes in the KKC (more specifically AWMF) that Rothfuss drew on from real history, and in both cases French 18th Century history:  1.) Kvothe makes a joke to Denna in Severen about a certain lady losing her virginity in a theater box.  This is based on Julie de Lespinasse, who *actually did* lose her virginity (aged 42) in a Parisian opera box in 1770, to Comte Jacques-Antoine de Guibert.  She confirms this - or at least *claims* this - in letters to him.  2.) Fela's "Interesting Things" story about blind people who have their site restored, and have to be taught how to identify shapes by looking at them. To quote Will Durant from "The Age of Voltaire":  "[Diderot] was especially attracted by a question which the Irishman William Molyneux had raised about 1692: Will a man born blind who has learned to distinguish a cube from a sphere by touch, be able, if his sight is restored, to differentiate at once a cube from a sphere, or will he require, before he can make this distinction, some experience of the relations between forms touched and the same forms seen?  The latter answer had been given by Molyneux and his friend [John] Locke.  "In 1728 Willian Cheselden operated successfully upon a fourteen-year-old boy who had been blind from birth; the boy had to be trained before he could differentiate forms by sight alone."   I'd also note that 18th Century French history, as well as 16th   17th Century Renaissance history, is filled with the sort of polymathic geniuses that, if they only existed in fiction, would be decried as Mary Sues/Gary Stus.    You know ... like Kvothe, but without the benefit of living in a world with true magic to become brilliant at.  If sympathy   sygaldry existed in the real world, men like Benjamin Franklin and Voltaire would've been the Kvothes of our history.  Can you imagine Leonardo di Vinci getting his hands on sygaldry?   I know who he is.  But, you see, you've wandered out of the World Nutjob Daily fever swamp - and into a place concerned with *facts* and *reality*, where the Scary Black Secret Muslim *wasn't* fathered by a Scary Black Communist.  Where Frank Davis was simply a friend of Obama's grandfather, a left-wing labor and civil rights advocate.  Where people don't hide under their bed from the FEMA black helicopters.   Pretty sure absolutely no-one, ever, in all of mankind, has ever hated not being *you*.   I wonder what brand of tin-foil you prefer.   Now do your own damn research, instead of carrying around goal posts because of what you don't want to believe.   http://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/09/us/politics/09obama.html?pagewanted=all  Look, interviews and everything!  And that's just one of many articles, linked from here:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_life_and_career_of_Barack_Obama#cite_note-birth-1    Hell, I've been waiting for a lot longer than that.    inaction on his part is pathetic.  Yes, he should have passed that bill in Congress, like the President totally has the power to do.   Doesn't she know that nukes are illegal in Davis?   If only there were some sort of easily accessible website where you could find out about his college life.  Better yet, some kind of combination of words, printed on paper, perhaps written by the person in question.   It's a 30 year average. Large parts of California *do*, normally, receive decent amounts of precipitation.  There's just a stark contrast with the parts that normally *don't*.  http://prism.oregonstate.edu/normals/   U.S. Territories are, by definition, part of the U.S.   Puerto Rico is part of the US.   /r/badscience ----- is that way.   The government can tell us what to eat  No, it can't.   It can determine what meals are served at public schools, which isn't remotely the same.   I started reading the *Wheel of Time* in 1989, when *Eye of the World* was first released.  A lot of people here probably weren't even born then.   Once you find yourself slogging through Book Nine, you'll wish it would.    Didn't she say her grandmother taught them to her?  That was Deoch.   It's pretty unlikely.  Nobility tend to guard their choice of livery, and the Maer strikes me as someone who would be more inclined than most not to be mis-represented.   Yes ... but in a SHTF situation, that mined salt will suddenly no longer be available.  So it'll suddenly be more valuable.   Those are the areas that would be flooded ... with *love*.   That's because it's mined from massive underground deposits.  If that ease of mining and distribution breaks down ... it'll skyrocket in value.    Here's me now  I've ... I've actually done that.  Probably had the same expression, too, but I'm white, so it wasn't quite as casually not-giving-a-fuck.   So did I, but the power was out for four days, so it wasn't really by choice.   Salt.  It's pretty damned hard to come by if you don't live next to an ocean, and it's very, very important for preservation.   I have "Catfish Billy" stuck in my head, and I was totally expecting to click on this thread and seeing someone mention a Yelawolf song.  You have disappointed me.   That ... was surprisingly accurate for the first thirty or forty seconds.  But it was pretty '80s after that.   That was actually pretty typical in the '90s.  Kids these days have it easy.    It's hard to believe, but i've always subscribed to idea that it's cheaper for one to just buy a prepared meal at a restaurant then go out and buy $20-$30 for stuff to cook some thing.  I just have to ask ... were you raised in a wealthy household?  Because I just can't imagine this mindset from a functioning adult who wasn't waited on hand and foot growing up.    Does anyone even care that Jerry Rice did?  I think the problem is that now, a lot of other receivers from that era can *claim* they didn't, whether they did or not, to make themselves look better.  But much like pine-tar or scuffing the ball for more than a century of major league pitching, we all know everyone did it.   Depends on what kind of aim Buffalo fans have.   My nickname for this coaching staff is "The Parliament."  Because much like a group of owls, all that I can hear is "Who? Who? Who?"   The two soldiers who beat up Kvothe/Kote were wearing blue and white - which are Alveron's colors (described in Severen as "ivory and sapphire).  And we know they're in Vint because the "king's coin" that  Aaron was looking to take was a gold noble.   "Do we have enough radars?"  "No."  "... OK, just added a few more radars, do we have enou-"  "NO!  MORE!"   Alveron IS one of my Top 3 candidates to be the Killed King  Except Alveron is still alive in the present-day frame.  There's really no one else who could be King, and wearing his colors.     Because of the Hoover dam, the Colorado River doesn't even remotely reach the ocean anymore.   That's because massive amounts of water are diverted for agriculture, industry, and residential use in California   Arizona (esp. California).   And now it's snowing, at a lower altitude than predicted (4500' where I'm at).  So ... that should be pretty damned helpful.      36, wearing three hoodies, but not tanned. Will trade one hoodie for a tan and a pick to be named later.   You've never dealt with the NYPD.    Are American biscuits anything like regular toast?  No.  Just ... no.  A proper Southern-style biscuit is in its own category of taste altogether.  Flaky, fluffy, a tad buttery, a bit savory ... and now I need a plate full.    This[2]  is apparently what an American calls a biscuit. This is a scone. It is a sweet  And there's where you've got it wrong.  There's nothing sweet about biscuits, especially Southern biscuits (which is what you put some nice, thick, sausage gravy over).    Many an American claims to be part Cherokee...  Well ... it's actually true for a lot of us.  The Cherokee moved around quite a bit, though not by choice.   Brain damage.    Manziel was extremely successful in college,  Which means precisely dick after Draft Day, except when it comes to *expectations to live up to*.    Davis is definitely the place to live if you like to bicycle and walk.   Seconding, thirding, and fourthing this.  Hell, I didn't *want* to drive when I lived in Davis (except to work in Woodland), simply because it's such a nice place to ride a bike, walk, or take a bus.  The Downtown grid, the Arboretum, the campus, all the little parks (Central, Chestnut, that one on Lake, etc.) ... very non-driving friendly.     That was encouraging.    Steve Freeman's profile and gallery page  *clicks on link ...*  ... oh, hey, look, it's two hours later.  I can't wait until he finishes his "U.S. aircraft carriers" graphic.   Part of the problem is that some counties cover a very wide range of altitudes.  This is especially obvious in eastern California - some of those narrow east-west counties start at 1-200 feet, and top out at anywhere from 6-10,000.  Colusa County, for example, is the Sacramento Valley, with a low point of about 45', and a high point of 7,055; Placer County goes from 145' to more than 9000', the high end being in the rather snowy (most years) Tahoe region.    I don't have to plan weeks in advance to buy a bottle of vodka and prepare to weep bitterfly.   [WHAT AN ACCOMPLISHMENT.](http://i.imgur.com/0Pftz26.jpg?1)    Depends on what kind of hipster-pop is playing the background.   Sorry, this can't be Russian.  Not enough missiles.   It actually felt like the Niners were the 2014 off-season champs.  That was a nice feeling.    Cleaning my ears with cotton swaps.  That's not irrational.    Good god.  ... y'all!    It's been 12 years  No, it hasn't.  That's not possible.  Like, five at the outside.   Sadly, I'd probably have even less use for them then, than I do now.   If someone's paying taxes into the system, they should get paid back out same as anyone else.  Makes the whole system work a lot better.    It's not the government's job to protect people from their own stupidity or bad decisions.  No, it's the government's job to protect me from *other people's* stupidity or bad decisions.  Hence mandatory immunization, food safety laws, laws against drunk driving, etc.   I got twenty+ detailed questions in, then suddenly it said "no more room available in this group" or some such, and ended the survey.

I didn't even know that sub existed.  Looks like it doesn't.   From a recent birth announcement in my local paper:  Paytin and Idalise.  Born to a couple named Kinderlin and Tristan.  (And a few weeks later, we get EmiLee, with sister Makaela).   WTF are you rambling about?    Ever had a younger sibling start a new pokemon adventure after a hundred plus hours?  Worse - Final Fantasy III (SNES) after more than a hundred hours.   ... I don't understand the question.  There are people that write in non-textbooks?  Like, free, rational, thinking people who are allowed to reproduce?   Immunization rates by country -  WHO:  http://apps.who.int/immunization_monitoring/globalsummary/timeseries/tscoveragebcg.html  UNICEF:  http://data.unicef.org/child-health/immunization  These are very well known facts.  But hey, you have Youtube videos showing poor funny-talking poor brown people, right?    Also, what makes one a "personal issue" and not the other?  The fact that one is *dangerously contagious*, and the other *isn't*.  You're trying real hard to force an equivalency that doesn't exist.   Or, you know, maybe some of us are capable of reading WHO statistics on immunization.  http://apps.who.int/immunization_monitoring/globalsummary/timeseries/tswucoveragebcg.html  It's almost like immunization is a very cheap, wide-spread process that even Third World countries see high levels of.  But all you know is "herr derpy derr brown people eat shit and are dirty derpity derr."   The article you linked to just makes you look even more stupid.  Great job on that.    Those counties happen to be the most liberal in the country.  Orange county is fairly conservative.   You'll be a pretty short drive from King's Canyon and Sequoia National Parks, which are spectacular, and less crowded than Yosemite.   Niners fan checking in.  Now you *almost* know how we feel about shitty last-second Super Bowl play-calling.  Except it was one play, not four, and you had last year.  But yeah, it sucks, doesn't it?   Well, that was the most thorough case of shooting one's self in the foot I've ever seen.   That felt a lot more like Seattle losing than Tom Brady winning.   Are there any *lower* bandwidth streams out there?  If I could afford the kind of connection for what's being posted, I could afford not to stream.   Well, they've done college basketball games on a carrier, wonder how hard it would be to do a full-sized football game?   DDH-142 *Hiei*, that would be.   See above.    Do you have examples? I didn't see any personally, I'd love to see what I missed. Purely out of curiosity.  The three that stood out: First, when Kvothe, Sim, and Wil were demonstrating sympathy to Denna, Kvothe as narrator says that she had never seen sympathy before. Except she had, in Trebon, when he lit that shingle on fire.  Second, when in Severen, Denna mocks him for even mentioning the Chandrian, when she was fully on-board - at length - in Trebon in wondering what the Chandrian were up to. Unless she's completely amnesiac about literally everything that happened in Trebon, this makes no sense.  Third, Mola didn't recognize Auri in NotW, when she should have according to what we're told in WMF: that all the girls at the University live in the same wing of the Mews, and all know each other. Mola's been there for about five years, Auri is apparently about twenty (give or take a year), they would've met while Auri was a student.  EDIT:  Also, Kvothe shouldn't have been surprised to learn that Sim's father was a duke.  After all, that's one of the first things he's told about Sim in NotW.  	112

I'm sure you're prepared for it, just remember everything it took to get there   Sorry but I have to ask.. Is the butter local?   Nothing says the morning like poppin pills   Damn that sounds good   Thick coffee? You may have to make this for me sometime   You can never go wrong with a nice glass of water   Wow I am sorry man (or woman?) Hope it doesn't reflect on the rest of your day      She was a physicians assistant? Respect   Yeah maybe. Idk it sounded big but anticlimactic    I got in halfway through and now the sirens have stopped. Not sure what happened to him but sounded like he was fine   Before this guy gets downvoted to hell just remember we're just considering options here   Anyone listening right now during all these sirens? Something about a person unconscious, medics going out    There's definitely a group mentalitiy in the workplace. If everyone there is friends with each other and happy then there's less chance they are going to leave. I work at a Walmart and my coworkers are actually pretty cool. Personally I won't be there much longer but it's not bad at the same time   babe wait babe noooo   They called fluffy fingers   You always hear about business owners giving people shit for giving them bad reviews. I don't know what's going on here   Not to bust on the show here but after Who Wants to be a Godparent I can't blame him   Wow that is a daunting task  You should include a count number for all the scotches Ted and Barney drink  Now that I think about it is Marshal and Lily the only people who don't like scotch?    It's always fun when you show up to the date, see she looks nothing like her profile, and instantly know the next 3 hours are going to be awful.  Off Tinder though the girl was actually awesome and we had coffee and sang in the car. Of course, at the end she said she was one month away from actually being 18...   Not only that but that's a really famous line. How do you fuck up the order of it   Dangus the Mangus   Because no one wants to go into the dentists, so you have people who come in already hating you. Then you have a rough schedule to keep between their responsibilities. And people's mouths are gross      I've got the free breakfast sandwich if anyone wants brunch with me   He's had a few rough nights designing this traffic utopia leave him alone   Seriously! In high school I was pretty quiet but people would always ask "are you alright?" Like yeah I'm alright now get out of my business!   Last week I finally finished Atlas Shrugged after months of reading it. I'd post my thoughts of it on here but too drunk and too many thoughts of it ha   Favorite book from high school.    Dude you are on a roll today   I like that umbrella part. I've also heard that With Tracy it was already raining, but with Robin Ted had to make it rain   That's exactly my point really. He's basing his whole exodus based on a republican be voted in next. Well who knows what the next republican might be like. Maybe he'll change America for the better   You do realize there have been more Republican presidents than Democratic ones right?    I think 100 million is a little much for this situation. For most people here that'd be over a million per year, and that would already be far more than most of us make.   But Like other people said set up long term investments   That the girl you think is into you is definitely into you   Well my one item would have to be the check the lottery people wrote me. Then go back in time say the 40's when I can actually use the check. Of course then my present lottery winnings are worth fortunes more. I then buy the US government, bang the First Lady of the time. Then I'd die fighting in Germany whistling a Charlie Parker tune   Math. Which is weird because I can do physics/chem type math but actual math classes I've never been good with. I think it's the lack of application the book's present   I've done it a couple times. Met up with this one chick, we smoked and watched a movie. Later we were making out and she wanted to have sex but I didn't go through with it, kindof a weird time for me.  Other time she ended up being like 45 and again I didn't go through with it   I just want to work at an independent coffee shop in Seattle and live in a crappy apartment. I'm a senior in college now and think about seriously doing it all the time :/   Holographic Pincer card for some lame card I had, can't  remember which   As an item of symbolism or what?   Back in 8th grade my friends and I counted down the days til Battlefront 2 came out. Now I've been waiting years   The episode that's an entire freakin documentary of Robin Sparkles makes me want to punch somebody.  I mean it was funny at first but I feel like it became more of an inside joke for the actors/writers than to us the audience   TIL adenosine=adrenaline from a high school bio student   Same here and since Ted says it like 20 times in the episode I figured actually saying bitch each time would be a little ridiculous. I agree though c word makes more sense for reactions   I work at walmart and we have chip readers along with the magnetic ones. The chip ones seriously take at least a minute to read (sounds short but not when there's a line). If we're gonna use the chip readers they need to optimize them   That's no ~~small moon~~ balloon   Just about every girl wearing leggings/yoga pants is wearing a thong   This is like straight out of a sitcom. Someone randomly playing the piano and it just happens to be a celebrity. I'm sure you guys will be telling that story for a long time   Tangled up we fall   A ball point banana!   I wouldn't say Marshal is two dimensional, but sometimes I feel like his personality is all over the place. I feel like they add traits to him for jokes but they don't always make sense for his charaacter   Fully agree with the changing thing. They made it sound like their only reason was "we want the kids to look like they're still the same age." Well through some more makeup on them because the Season 9 HIMYM is not Season 2 HIMYM   The only food I think of with Wisconsin now is their frozen custard. I wish I could eat that forever   How do they get the mail?   Grabs spork   I felt the same way. I think my biggest complain is they left out not only major characters but the major plot that went with said characters.

 Stuff like that takes a crazy amount of time to render on consumer class desktops.    Pickles are cucumbers. I found this out 2 years ago.   Is it me, or does it seem like gaming companies are taking advantage of reddit for cheap advertising?   Am I the only one that is amazed at how well he said that guys name at the beginning of the video?   http://m.imgur.com/Vhw0Sfi  I have yet to get a response.   Hey reddit, i have just started trying to learn after effects. I downloaded a template on youtube and played around with it for fun. But my question is, how can i get the rain to continue through the whole video? It cuts off when the text appears. Thanks for the help, it really means a lot to me as a beginner.  Template Source:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HEMPFgWIt-c  My project: https://mega.co.nz/#!mVlECATK!KxO-AQdaZycVXKjUO_jqki1LAxUdC-BiLjPlfRlN8yE    Yeah, definitely go with the 7770ghz. Go to pcpartpicker.com and filter the gpu selection out and it will find you the lowest price.   What is your budget? The best value for a gpu right now is the gtx 760 for the 200-300 dollar price range(if you SLI 2 of them together, it is a great deal more powerful than the 780.). If you want something sub 100 dollar range, get the 7770 ghz edition. The ghz edition ironically goes for less most of the time than the regular 7770. If you aren't looking for cuda cores for programs that will utilize them (adobe after effects, photoshop, fireworks, etc.) or are wanting to sli 2 or more gpus together then go amd. The 7770ghz pulls about 60 fps on high on battlefield 3 with buffs like anti-aliasing turned down. Hope i helped you out.  	8
 What made this creepypasta exactly? I'm the original author from that wiki entry as well so it's not just a copy. I want to get my story on as many places as possible.      Im sure many of you have been to a newly remodeled McDonalds. Possibly one with a McCafe.   But have you ever looked up why they started remodeling the restaurants in the first place?   The first McCafe in the states popped up in Chicago back in May of 2001. That was just the beginning.   Now over the last five years, McDonalds has taken to remodeling every single restaurant in America. Most of you might even be asking yourself how long its been since you last stepped foot in an old McDonalds.  Ask anyone whos done some market research and youll hear something strange. McDonalds loses money on the process. Its a fact. The new furniture isnt pulling new customers and the McCafes cant sell coffee that cheap and turn a profit. Look at Starbucks prices and youll see what I mean.   Stakeholders say they wanted a more adult vibe for the restaurant. A classier look for a classier America.   Wrong answer. Google it right now: whats McDonalds target age group? Its children and teens. It always has been.   So then why did they start all these remodels? Why would one of the largest corporations in America spend over 1 billion on a terrible marketing strategy?  Thats where things get interesting.   Lets start with the play places.  If you can remember, almost no two play places at McDonalds were identical. Some of them were really fun. I know I had a few favorites.   Well some of them were also really dangerous. The first gem I could find was a carousel play place in Lancaster, Pennsylvania back in the 1980s that got shut down mere months after opening. Little information was given about why they closed. The lot has been vacant ever since.   If you find the right connections in Lancaster though, you just might be able to read an article that didnt make it to print.   Children would play on the merry-go-round in ways they werent supposed to, you see. Theyre kids, so of course they would. Well one day a few kids managed to crawl underneath the thing but then they never made it back out.   The whole incident was so heavily guarded by McDonalds PR, youd be troubled to find a single person that was even there that whole afternoon. The only witness anyone could find had this to say:  When they went under, a few parents started calling for help. Then something happened to the lights. The carousel kept getting brighter and the music was deafening. I ran out of the building when the machine started to smoke, but I looked back through the window to see if the kids were alright and [the employees] were just standing there behind the registers! They looked like they were still waiting for customers!  Weirder and weirder stories pick up from there through the years. Reports of children sinking into ball pits that should only be a foot deep. Mothers searching play tubes for their kids, only to find a lonely pair of shoes.  But the play places held a mere fraction of the incidents.  Back in 1996 in Knoxville, Tennessee there was a business man of his 40s who went into a McDonalds restroom and remained there for seven hours. Patrons noted that he refused to leave the furthest back stall.  The police were finally called and they managed to break down the door. He was restrained by paramedics as he wouldnt willingly leave the restroom.   As they pulled him out of the stall he began screaming bloody murder take me back! I want to go back! but the moment he exited the restaurant he passed out. He had no memory of ever going to a McDonalds the day of the incident.   The restaurant was shut down before anyone could inspect the stall he had shut himself in. However, anyone who used the restroom that day mentioned hearing several voices whispering things like:  It wasnt him.  We have to go back  Saw you smile.  Then there was a fry cook somewhere in Vermont back in 99 who walked into the middle of the restaurant and dumped scalding oil on himself without flinching or saying a word. Several of the customers started to laugh and roll around in the burning oil alongside him and all were rushed to the hospital. Only one survived but refuses to make a statement. Not that she easily could. Her throat melted all the way through and had to be completely restructured.  The manager claimed he didnt remember ever hiring the fry cook and that he wasnt in any official paperwork. His name tag didnt even have a name, just #### written on it. Once again, the McDonalds was closed without a trace.  Most of the stories sounded like urban legends to me but it never failed. Wherever I found a story, a McDonalds had been shut down in its wake.  Near the late 2000s the number of cover ups had become so frequent that McDonalds decided to shut all of them down and rebuild. Every. Single. One.  But of course theyd miss a few.  I needed to see one for myself. I remember going in the old McDonalds as a kid but that was before the frequency of the incidents. That was when it was still safe.  There was a small town on the way to my parents house just off the highway. Oroska was its name. Maybe a hundred residents. Completely untouched by the outside world, practically forgotten. It was pointless to stop there for any normal reason because there wasnt a gas station or rest stop. Not even a sign to let you know you were close.   Lets just say I had to sneak my way around some very old building permits to discover that they had one of the few McDonalds (aside from some treasured landmarks) that has yet to go through a remodel since the 1970s. How lucky is that? I was surprised they even had a fast food place, yet they didnt have a market or post office.  I planned a trip to my parents place for the weekend, with a stop at Oroska on the way. It was already dark out since it was the dead of winter and I didnt get off work till 5. I was cold and grumpy about driving at night, but mostly determined.   I dont think I wouldve ever found the place before phone GPS, the turn off from the highway was just a dirt road with no landmarks or anything. As I pulled into town not a single one of the few scattered houses had lights on. Most of the street lights were out as well, as though nobody had remembered to change the bulbs in years. This place really was untouched. Id be surprised if most (if not all) of the residents hadnt moved out or simply died off. It definitely had the makings of a ghost town anyway.   I was about to lose hope when I finally saw it. The nauseous yellow light of those golden arches barely illuminating a vacant parking lot in the distance. It buzzed and flickered like a fly zapper running out of batteries. The sign below said eat new eggs mc-uffin. We like to saw you smile. Which I assumed was just a lazy teens handy-work. I pulled into the lot and carelessly parked my car in the center (there was nobody else there anyway).   When I stepped out of my car, I felt a squish under my foot. There was a burger covered in mold with a rancid liquid oozing out. The smell was absolutely vomit worthy. I jumped out to scrape the contents of the burger from my shoe when I noticed the whole parking lot was covered in trash. There were half eaten boxes of fries and sun baked childrens toys spilling out of old greased up McDonalds bags. Everything was camouflaged by a layer of dirt and snow like it had been here for months, possibly years.   I hurried across the lot to avoid retching all over the asphalt. As I approached the door I noticed the windows were caked in dust. Somebody had taped a piece of paper to the door with the word CLOSED scribbled across it in red marker, yet the sign hung from the inside clearly said open and all the lights were on. Cautiously I approached the door and pushed.   An artificial bell hummed an old McDonalds tune that fizzled out on the last few notes as the door creaked open. I looked around the fluorescent lit room and saw it was void of life. There was nobody sitting at any of the tables and nobody attending the registers. Somebody had left a tray on one of the tables in the back but there was no other sign someone had been here.   The inside was at least a little cleaner. The toys on display by the counter were of characters Id never heard of, likely from before my time. The whole place was covered in faded coats of yellow and red paint and all the tables had that classic McDonalds wood finish. The wood looked completely rotten, but slathered in coats of polish as a sad attempt to keep it looking new. All of it had a sort of green hue which I contributed to the old lights. The most noticeable element, though, was a terrible burning plastic smell that stung my nose.  I went up to the register. If anyone was even here, I felt like I shouldnt order anything but I was hoping maybe I could ask someone a few questions.  I waited for a good 15 minutes in silence. I shouted hello with only a muted echo for a response. I had been to a few McDonalds with bad service in the past but this was insane. With how dirty the whole place was I shouldve expected as much.  Just as I was about to turn around and give up, the cash register popped open. It was practically begging me to take a tip for myself. Besides, didnt I deserve a slight reward for wasting my time here? I casually walked over to it and saw at least a dozen 20s stacked high.   Looking around to make sure nobody was watching, I reached in to take a few bills when the thing suddenly snapped closed right on my fingers. The metal dug deep into my flesh leaving a dark trail of blood down the side of the counter. I yelped in pain.  Behind the counter at the other end of the grill was a first aid kit hanging on the wall. The lights were burned out in the kitchen area but I needed a bandage, pronto. I hopped over the table and made my way to the back. The burning smell was getting stronger as I walked. I noticed the grill was covered in a thick layer of grease, completely unsuitable for cooking. I passed by the frying station and the oil was filled to the top with maggots.  I quickened my walk to the first aid hoping to get patched up and out of there as soon as possible. I was starting to realize that this restaurant definitely wasnt open for business anymore and I probably shouldnt have entered it in the first place. I opened up the first aid kit and had to swallow some vomit.   A cloud of mold burst out from it in every direction followed by the same bubbling black ooze that was on the burger outside. I started coughing and waving my hands in the air to clear the mold dust floating around.  The same bell I heard playing that McDonalds tune started up again as I steadied myself. I assumed it was broken like the rest of this dump. I looked back toward the counter and noticed everything seemed farther away. I must have been disoriented from losing blood and that awful smell. I looked down at my hand to see how bad the wound was and my eyes widened. There was no wound on my hand at all.  I rushed back towards the counter in a panic when something under the stove caught my foot and I fell. In the darkness my eyes started to adjust and I saw the outline of a body. Somebody was under there. Maybe they were unconscious and needed help! I yanked at the persons arm and a half decayed body slid out across the floor.   They were wearing a McDonalds employee shirt with a nametag that read ####. Their mouth was contorted into a sickening grin but their eyes were screaming. I tried to shout but no sound came out like when trying to wake up from a nightmare. As I scrambled to get back up to the counter, the lights had started to dim and the McDonalds tune was getting louder, the notes fizzling and distorting as they played.  Once I had gotten my grip above the counter, I froze.   Since entering, I never looked at the side of the restaurant opposite the counter. There was a play place.  The glass separating the main restaurant from the play area had hundreds of bloody handprints smearing down toward the floor. The tube slide was caved in with chunks of red liquid spurting out from the tiny hole left at the bottom. There was a row of nooses tied to the monkey bars in the corner with employees wearing the same #### nametags hanging from them. The tables around the perimeter had skeletons with rotting food left on trays, some of the food hanging from the skulls mouthes. I looked on in horror, too shocked to move.   While the rest of the restaurant went dark, a bulb in the center of the play place continued to glow like a carnival spotlight. Below it was a massive ball pit, barely able to contain all of its colored plastic balls. It was smoking under the blaring white light, making that awful burning plastic smell.   The balls began to rattle and fall off the edge when something inside started shuffling around. I wanted to run so badly but my body refused. Then suddenly the music went dead and the movement stopped.   A yellow glove slowly crept upward from the pit below, writhing its fingers as it went. A connected red and white sleeve came after it, slowly alternating colors as they appeared from underneath. The arm continued to reach toward the sky, growing more and more, while its joints popped and cracked like breaking branches. By the end that arm had to be at least six feet long.   It finally reached for the lit bulb on the ceiling with its gangly gloved fingers and began to twist it loose.  I broke into a sprint, jumping over the counter and toppling chairs as I went. That last light went out just as I got to the exit. I bashed through the door, breaking the glass in the process. As I rolled into the parking lot I heard a distant scream, and then something whispered right next to my ear in dead silence. It had the same tinny distortion as the McDonalds tune  Come back. I want to see you smile.  I havent told anyone about what happened there that night. There was an article online saying Oroska burned to the ground a few days later. I dont know if it was a cover up or something else, but Im never going back to find out.  I didnt share this because I want you to get involved, by the way. I shared it to warn you what happens when you do.   You can go to a new McDonalds, keep getting your Big Macs, get your McCafe coffee, thats fine. They did something to the remodels to make them safe, at least for now.   But dont ever go into an old McDonalds. Not even the drive thru.      For those of you not up to speed, you can read part 1 of what's happening [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/2e98vp/palms_tower/)   Okay, so I woke up in my bed just a few minutes ago with no recollection of how I got back here, turned my laptop on that luckily survived the events of the night before and have started typing this latest addition. I can't recall anything after passing out yesterday...or I guess its still today. I'm really turned around because It's I know it's been a full day and night since I last updated and so much has happened but my computer calendar, reddit, and everything else is claiming its still 8/22/2014 which is only two days after my first visit to **[5,433 Cubits and 2 Palms Tower]**. That shouldn't be possible!  So before I get into things, I need to thank user kamafr for deciphering the text on my last entry. After looking back over the article I noticed that wherever I tried to type a formal noun of any kind like a friend's name or a location or whatever, something was changing the text. I don't know if my account got hacked or what. I hear about that happening way too often on posts like this to assume anything else but the text it changed to actually seems relevant. So yeah, here's what he found out:  **[18 19 14 15    13 14 22.    5 8 13 3    19 7 4 18 4    22 14 17 3 18    0 13 3    8    18 7 0 11 11    5 8 13 3    24 14 20,    18 15 4 0 10    19 7 4 18 4    22 14 17 3 18    0 13 3    8    18 7 0 11 11    5 8 13 3    24 14 20    18 14 14 13 4 17.    2 11 14 0 10 4 3    8 13    18 10 8 13,    8    18 19 4 0 11    0 22 0 24    8 13 19 14    24 14 20 17    17 14 14 12    0 13 3    2 20 19    24 14 20 17    19 14 13 6 20 4    5 17 14 12    24 14 20 17    19 7 17 14 0 19    0 13 3    15 20 19    24 14 20    8 13    19 7 4    15 8 19    22 8 19 7    19 7 4    14 19 7 4 17 18.    3 14    13 14 19    18 4 4 10    19 7 4    19 17 20 19 7.]**  So basically **[5,433 Cubits and 2 Palms Tower]** is actually **[G + R 11:4-9]**. Before the events of this last week, this wouldn't have seemed possible to me but now I really think it's true.  I'm about to show you the pages I wrote before and during my most recent visit to the tower. I know you're not going to believe any of it and I know I have trouble with it myself, but this is the only place I know where someone out there might find some semblance of truth and take it as a warning. I've been shaking like crazy the whole time I'm writing this because the things I saw just weren't possible and I don't exactly know why I'm still alive. Something is happening and I think you all need to be ready for it. Nobody nearby seems to notice it like I do but maybe whatever's affecting them hasn't reached any of you yet. Let's get started  5:30 PM 8/22/2014  UPDATE! Holy fuck update! So it was my last day at this internship before starting back up the fall semester and I wanted one last picture of the place to remind me how kick ass this job was. I went up to our lounge room on the 6th floor and decided to take a nice shot of the fireplace with our sunny little balcony in the background. The view was kind of bleh since there was more construction in the background here as well (like I needed another reminder) but I didn't care because it was still a really cool place. I noticed that the lighting was really bad in the first pic I took, as you can see here: [work photo 1](http://i.imgur.com/n6epR1B.jpg)  So I decided to take another shot. Here's the picture: [work photo 2](http://i.imgur.com/hRiioJ4.jpg)  I had to do a double take to make sure I wasn't seeing things. There's no way it could be there! My apartment is very far south of where I work and the balcony faces the north side. Then I looked even closer. My apartment complex was suddenly to the left of the building. In the time it took me to take a single photo, the layout of several key parts of the city have changed. From what I can tell, just the central area of my apartment complex has moved to the northern lot of town along with that...that thing. That awful, awful tower! I don't even know what happened to what was there before it. I know I went to school with a girl that lived up in that area and I hope to god she's okay. I screamed at my coworkers to look and they all thought I was crazy like it had just been there the whole time. Not a single person realized what had happened or even that the building was never there to begin with. I began to wonder why was I able to remember where it used to be? Or more-so, why did it let me remember? Why is it following me?  I'm going to head home from work and update you all on my plan of action. I should just escape while I can, I've got nobody to turn to anyway. The cops would think I was crazy, and my friends aren't any better about helping me in a pinch. Ugh, I wish **[6120736176656420736f756c]** was still around. He was the only friend I had that always had my back. I don't want to get all sappy so I'll just say he isn't with us anymore. Ugh, I need to stop thinking for awhile. Be back later.  8:00 PM 8/22/2014  I'd been pacing the room for the last couple hours trying to decide if I'm going to go in there and if I do, how do I log everything. I caved and decided to go. I was also going to go with my original plan of bringing my laptop with me to type stuff down while I'm there. I really don't want to sit in that fucking building for any length of time, but I know if something happens, at least my text will be out there. There's a chance somebody might find it someday and do something with it and I need to take that chance. I decided to pack for extreme circumstances. I'm not some idiot in a horror movie, this is real and I'm not about to make any dumb decisions. I gathered together plenty of food in case I somehow got trapped (I mean the building was unfinished), a flashlight with extra batteries, my laptop, an extra battery for my laptop, a camera, my phone, a few basic tools (big fucking hammer, screwdriver, etc.), plenty of rope and a knife from the kitchen. I hope I wouldn't need it but I'm being cautious. This is it, there's nothing more to it. I'm going. I'll post another update later.  10:00 PM 8/22/2014 I made it in to the basement. The gate was still unlocked although this time much harder to swing open as if it were rusted over. On my way in, I was worried that whatever I saw last time would be back again but so far I haven't seen anything. The light in the back room was still on, flickering a little, and what it lit up was just a storage area for cement mixers, some tools, and a bunch of unmarked boxes. Possibly one of the boxes that fell and made that ungodly distant echo. The strange thing this time around though was that every sound I made seemed stiff and compressed without a single echo at all. The air was stale and hot as though I'd been sitting in a smaller room for a long time with the door closed. Beyond here was a hallway that lead into a series of other hallways all musty and unfinished but still dimly lit. Perhaps they kept the lights on at night as a safety protocol? I dunno. I walked down the halls for a bit and here are some phone pics of what I saw: [basement photo 1](http://i.imgur.com/mYX066Z.jpg) [basement photo 2](http://i.imgur.com/mJx7oPQ.jpg)  The interior looked really beat up for having been a new building but I've never worked in construction so I have no idea what unfinished buildings are supposed to look like. Sorry for the poor picture quality, by the way. I wasn't ready to pull out my nicer camera yet since it has a pretty short battery life and I think I'll save that for whatever I find higher up. I managed to find a staircase and I've decided to take a break to write this out before I continue up. As I'm typing this I keep hearing creaks in the metal above. I'm hoping it's just the wind. Another update coming.  10:49 PM 8/22/2014  I can't believe it's taken me 45 minutes to get up these stairs, and I'm still not done! I wasn't counting floors or anything but there's no way I'm not up to the top by now! I had to take a break because I'm so out of breath so I decided to make an update. There isn't much light up here anymore and my flash is wigging out so I had to take a night vision shot on my camera: [Elevator shaft stairs](http://i.imgur.com/flA0INc.jpg)   I can't even see the bottom anymore. It's getting pretty cold up here too and I think it started storming outside because I keep hearing these booming sounds all up and down the stairs. I have to keep going though, I won't be satisfied until I get to the top. I really hope there's an answer waiting for me there.  12:11 AM 8/23/2014  This is impossible. I haven't seen any windows so I have no way of knowing but this is definitely impossible. I'm still climbing the stairs. I'm scared out of my mind because I know I've gone up at least 20, 30, maybe even 40 or 50 floors and that tower had to be 15 floors tops. I'm so tired and so cold and nothing makes any sense. I'm going to go a little further and if I don't find something soon I need to head back. I can already tell my sanity must be slipping because the giant mountain-sized echoes are coming back and they get a little louder with every step I take. I've also started seeing movement in the stairs below when I peer over the edge. I could just barely make out some features but it almost looked like **[18 15 8 11 11    19 7 4 8 17    1 11 14 14 3    14 13    19 7 4    18 19 0 8 17 18.    4 21 4 17 24 14 13 4.]** with grinning teeth. I know it's just my mind playing tricks on me but I'm going to start going again because the longer I stay here the worse the illusions get.  12:30 AM 8/23/2014  I just reached...whatever floor I reached, and it's different. Not by much, but it's different. The floor extends a little beyond the square area of the staircase into a small room in the corner. There isn't much in here besides some very old wires and a pile of junk on the floor. I got the flash working again on my camera so I took a picture:  [extra room](http://i.imgur.com/kXLXAW6.jpg)  As you can see, the structure of the room doesn't really match the rest of the building architecture. It's all made with brick and looks far too old to have just been built. Stranger yet is a folder in the pile of junk on the floor. It's dated 2/11/95 so this file is 19 years old. It's possible that this junk was just brought up here for whatever reason but that still doesn't explain how old everything looks. Something isn't adding up and I need to find out what that something is. I need to keep going because even as I type I can feel eyes watching me like the walls are alive or something. I almost thought I heard someone say **[8    2 0 13    18 4 4    24 14 20    19 7 17 14 20 6 7    19 7 4    18 2 17 4 4 13.    19 7 4    20 13 2 14 13 5 20 18 4 3    0 17 4    5 8 17 18 19    19 14    5 0 11 11.]** If I don't make it to the top quickly I'm going to have a mental break down.  2:45 AM 8/23/2014  I finally made it to the top and it's so much bigger than anything I've ever seen. There's so many corridors leading on and on forever. Some of the rooms I don't even want to walk in to because they don't look like they end. The walls are covered in **[6 20 19    24 14 20    20 13 19 8 11    24 14 20    18 19 14 15    18 2 17 4 0 12 8 13 6]** and it just keeps going on like that from wall to wall. I can't imagine how any of this even got here. It's so hard to type with all the ringing from that echoing. The echo just keeps going and doesn't ever stop. I think the thing is catching up, I can smell **[0    13 4 22    11 14 17 3    7 0 18    17 8 18 4 13] getting stronger. I'm going to walk and type. Hopefully it doesn't [8    0 12    12 0 12 12 14 13.    8    5 4 11 11    0 13 3    18 14    7 0 21 4    8    1 20 8 11 19    5 17 14 12    1 4 11 14 22.    8    22 8 11 11    2 11 0 8 12    0 11 11    19 7 8 13 6 18    8 13    12 24    14 22 13    13 0 12 4 18.        19 7 4 18 4    7 0 21 4    15 14 22 4 17    19 14    18 7 20 19    7 4 0 21 4 13,    19 7 0 19    8 19    17 0 8 13    13 14 19    8 13    19 7 4    3 0 24 18    14 5    19 7 4 8 17    15 17 14 15 7 4 2 24:    0 13 3    7 0 21 4    15 14 22 4 17    14 21 4 17    22 0 19 4 17 18    19 14    19 20 17 13    19 7 4 12    19 14    1 11 14 14 3,    0 13 3    19 14    18 12 8 19 4    19 7 4    4 0 17 19 7    22 8 19 7    0 11 11    15 11 0 6 20 4 18,    0 18    14 5 19 4 13    0 18    19 7 4 24    22 8 11 11.    0 13 3    22 7 4 13    19 7 4 24    18 7 0 11 11    7 0 21 4    5 8 13 8 18 7 4 3    19 7 4 8 17    19 4 18 19 8 12 14 13 24,    19 7 4    1 4 0 18 19    19 7 0 19    0 18 2 4 13 3 4 19 7    14 20 19    14 5    19 7 4    1 14 19 19 14 12 11 4 18 18    15 8 19    18 7 0 11 11    12 0 10 4    22 0 17    0 6 0 8 13 18 19    19 7 4 12,    0 13 3    18 7 0 11 11    14 21 4 17 2 14 12 4    19 7 4 12,    0 13 3    10 8 11 11    19 7 4 12.    0 13 3    19 7 4 8 17    3 4 0 3    1 14 3 8 4 18    18 7 0 11 11    11 8 4    8 13    19 7 4    18 19 17 4 4 19    14 5    19 7 4    6 17 4 0 19    2 8 19 24,    22 7 8 2 7    18 15 8 17 8 19 20 0 11 11 24    8 18    2 0 11 11 4 3    18 14 3 14 12    0 13 3    4 6 24 15 19,    22 7 4 17 4    0 11 18 14    14 20 17    11 14 17 3    22 0 18    2 17 20 2 8 5 8 4 3.    0 13 3    19 7 4 24    14 5    19 7 4    15 4 14 15 11 4    0 13 3    10 8 13 3 17 4 3 18    0 13 3    19 14 13 6 20 4 18    0 13 3    13 0 19 8 14 13 18    18 7 0 11 11    18 4 4    19 7 4 8 17    3 4 0 3    1 14 3 8 4 18    19 7 17 4 4    3 0 24 18    0 13 3    0 13    7 0 11 5,    0 13 3    18 7 0 11 11    13 14 19    18 20 5 5 4 17    19 7 4 8 17    3 4 0 3    1 14 3 8 4 18    19 14    1 4    15 20 19    8 13    6 17 0 21 4 18.]**   [DO](http://i.imgur.com/hDFcO1N.jpg)   [NOT](http://i.imgur.com/R7iI9Ei.jpg)   [SEEK](http://i.imgur.com/a8OjCk2.jpg)    And that's the last saved update I could find on my laptop. I don't even remember writing that last entry at all or even if I ever really got to the top. I blacked out and suddenly woke up in my bed. I don't know what any of this means but if it coincides with what was deciphered from my first entry on reddit, then there isn't much time left. I don't know what to do or how I can stop any of this. This is above me. This is above all of us. I don't know if I have the will to try going back to **[5,433 Cubits and 2 Palms Tower]** but I need to make a decision soon because I can still hear the echo even now. It's **[coming for everyone]** and I can't stop it.  	5
       Like, if I wanted people's opinions on product X without sounding like I'm just trying to drum up positive pub for product X.  Or If I saw a commercial during the Superb Owl which piqued my interest.                                                                           78"  I think this might be the factor that gives him his greatest advantage over his opponents in the middleweight division.  His reach measures a ridiculous 78", which a lot of heavyweights don't even have.  Similar to Jon Jones, he is extremely successful at using his freakish body to keep people away.  No one in the MW even comes close.  Hell, even Cain Velasquez only measures 77".  People clamoring on about how Machida, Mousassi, and Belfort will destroy this guy seem to forget what JJ did to two of those guys (And I'm a diehard Machida fanboy).  Will Weidman have the same success as JJ?  Who knows.  Jones' greatest asset is his intelligence in the cage and his ability to adapt to opponents mid fight.  Weidman seems to be able to do that so far.  His striking still looks weird and sloppy to me, but he's got a fantastic coach that is continuously refining that aspect of his game.  His wrestling prowess is already known.  The only unknown seems to be his submission game, and like Jones, we haven't seen him in a position to be submitted yet.  Am I talking out of my ass?  Who knows?  Probably.  But does anyone else think that his incredible genetics will keep him at the top for a while?  Why or why not?  If I'm making a stupid argument, please break it down and call me a noob or whatever.  But until someone convinces me otherwise, I'm hellbent on believing that his 78" arms are gonna hold on to that belt for a little bit.   I'm not saying that reach is everything, but Jones' dominance stems from his ability to use it effectively, and so far, Weidman seems to be learning from JJ's sucsess.  Anderson Silva's reach was also a ridiculous 77.6".   Cain Velasquez: 77"  Cigano: 77"  Travis Browne:  80"  Bigfoot:  82"  **Jon Jones: 84"**  Rashad:  75"  Phil Davis:  79"  Gus:  79"  Glover:  76"  **Weidman:  78"**  Machida:  74"  Belfort:  74"  Mousassi:  76"  Jacare:  74"      I honestly want to know what weakness people believe Meisha can exploit to get a win, and how?  KO?  Sub?  Decision?                                                                  We're talking Cigano.  I personally think he could benefit from a Machida camp.  If anyone knows how to not get bullied by wrestlers, that's the guy.  I don't think I've ever seen Machida grinded against the cage like Cigano was last night.  Or if not Machida, then perhaps a Munoz camp?  What are your opinions?   Three major upsets in college football, followed by a #3 vs #5 ROFL stomping by FSU.  Then Boston wins the god damn pennant.  Then, the UFC puts on the most entertaining card possibly in their history.  In all the excitement, I neglected hockey.  Anything interesting happen?   A few years ago I traded B.J. Ryan and Alex Rodriguez for Ladanian Tomlinson.  It was weird, but both teams benefited since they were both dynasty leagues.  Same commish for both leagues, so he allowed it after thoughtful examination.   His targets and catches have been steadily increasing.  He's a big boy, and Stafford seems to be trusting him more and more every week.  If Detroit doesn't trade for a WR, might he be the answer to our WR2 prayers?                                                                        I have Witten/Cook, and Seattle/SanFran.  Should I drop one of them to pick up Bernard Pierce?                                                      Is Connor basically the ultra aggressive version of Lyoto?  Everything that Joe Rogan says about him describes Lyoto.  Wide karate stance, superior recognition of distance, great vertical movement, kicks with no windup, etc, etc, etc.  Obviously he doesn't have Machida's ground game, but is it fair to say that his standup is an aggressive Machida style?      I'm not culturally caught up with celebrity drama, but Spike's recent AMA sure did bring out a lot of haters.  I counted at least twenty people call him a piece of shit without explaining why he's a piece of shit.  Can someone catch me up?         http://i.imgur.com/2zqPZ3u.jpg  Dynasty league with 40 man rosters.  These are the available 3B options in my league, and I just traded David Wright for a shit load of prospects, including Sano.  I'm not in title contention, and I've stocked up on draft picks for next year.  I just need a 3B to finish out this year.  I don't want to be accused of tanking, and beyond that, someone owns my first rounder.      UFC or otherwise.  I just want a schedule to follow.  I get most, if not all, of my MMA news from this sub, and it's been great.  But the lack of a calendar or something is quite frustrating.  It wouldn't even be difficult.  We could do it like the /r/IAmA sub, and just list the events that are coming up.  Any thoughts?  Or am I being too unreasonable?                                                This is literally the worst time to do so.  Your friends and family are going to be more religious than ever, and this will cause a greater chasm to form between you and them.  We all know, and have experienced, how even the most even keeled liberal muslims go batshit crazy during Ramadan.  Because of the fake nature of Islamic spirituality, you really have to pick and choose the right times to fight the right battles.  Ramadan is not the right time.  Neither is Hajj season.  Stay away from those two events on the calendar when making life altering proclamations to your family.                                                    There is always a  ^  in front of a pitcher who is starting that day.  I check my rosters every day.  Well, today, Yahoo did not have the  ^   by Travis Wood or Dillon Gee's names.  I completely missed Wood's start, and just barely got Gee into my lineup.  Has this happened to anyone else?  This is not the first time either.               http://i.imgur.com/crRPZnF.jpg   Is this the USA network's attempt at a gritty corrupt cop drama like FK's "The Sheild?"  Because if it is, I don't think they will succeed.  If they want to stick to their USA formula for dramas like Burn Notice, and Cover Affairs, they'll be alright.  But trying to go gritty when you have no clue is just unwatchable television.  A lot like TNT's failed cop drama two years ago with Dylan McDermott called "Dark Blue" or "Deep Blue" or something like that.   It is not a credit card, but a charge card, so it does not report any hard limit to the credit bureaus.  But if I spend money on it, it most certainly does report that information.  Will my credit take a hit if I close it?  It's is a pretty old account, and it does have an annual fee.  It was advantageous to get it at the time, as I had no credit.  But now that I'm doing ok, should I close it out?                                                      http://i.imgur.com/3XZ89tV.jpg     	163
 I just relapsed today, don't worry about it. I'm just going to pick myself up an  learn from it. Here, good [luck](http://imgur.com/cU848GQ)      The last time I started nofap I made it to twelve days and decided ah well... I guess you can guess what happened. Now I'm resetting my counter for the third and last time!! If anyone else is really serious message me and we can help each other stay on track but if you're not serious please, don't waste my time.   Hey no problem :)   I'm a guy, I do. I think it looks nicer going bald for a number for a number of reasons. It makes you look bigger, if you know what I mean. It looks cleaner. Feels nice and smooth. And a million other reasons.   I understand about most things being drugs but I'm talking about illegal drugs. Even if it became legal though I wouldn't go near it just like I don't smoke ciggarettes.   Cause it's a drug, I would never go near it but I'm not against those that do. To each his own. I dislike the idea of it cause it seems to dumb down those that take it and it stinks worse than anything!!   But I grabbed his arm back, then a monstrous creature arose from the drug. It turned out it was a super scary homogenous sassy Hasidic Jewish snow yeti...   It turns out uncle Ben, yes old uncle Ben who is always so kind and collected, was part of an underground snail racing club and they were feeding the snails steroids. When I bailed him out we went home. He laughed about it, even back then. When we got home we walked into our tiny, tiny apartment and we couldn't believe what we saw...   Go onto AskReddit and look on the side bar, from there click unsubscribe and it'll stop but if you like AskReddit just check it whenever you feel like it :)   Go onto the sub and unsubscribe.   Hi I'm scottish too :)  I...  * Get up  * eat  * wash  * Get dressed  * watch tv  * go to school    I'm not done with it by my face has gotten longer and I look a lot better.    Yeah, I love his videos. I've been watching him since he only had a few thousand subscribers (I'm not a hipster :) ) but yeah his videos are supercalifragilisticexpidaliotious.   Can I ask, do you watch Matthew Santoro on YouTube?   Jesus Christ!! Yes! Tell someone and help get it dealt with.   Exact same for me I have a big family my mum has it better/worse depending on how you look at it. She had 7 brothers and 6 sisters and  5 of the boys are dead.   I know right they foreshadowed what's going to happen to poor Glenn, Mwahaha, mwahahahaha!!   I know I'm not him but a lot of celebrities make reddit accounts so they can do AmA's I mean look at /u/boogibs she did her Ama, posted one more thing and left. She might not be a big name but it's still the same.   Did you like the way you died on the Walking Dead? Do you think Tyreese deserved better or do you think it was his time?   Ok thanks (I'm so I don't have a wife yet).   You're welcome, good luck again :)   I've done (am still doing) nofap and it was/is very helpful but I was just wondering if masturbation is a sin.   Hello, first of all thank you for not just assuming that all religious people are "bible bashing idiots" and taking the time to form your own opinions. I have many reasons for following my religion. Jesus was alive, that has been proven, now people might not believe in the virgin birth or in the miracles like we do, however, I think that even if it turns out that every religion on Earth is wrong it is better to believe in something, anything, and have a chance at going somewhere better. Now that's not why I follow my faith. I follow it cause it's a nice way to live life. Sure even non religious people can lead great lifes and most do but it's nice having some guidelines. Also I feel like we have added emotions. When we feel like we've done something good that will please the lord it lasts long and if we sin the guilt is immediate. I also wonder how people can look at our  universe and not believe in god. I don't believe everything in the bible for example Adam and Eve. I think that story is used to show why there is sin and suffering in the world. When people ask why a god would allow such horrible things like rape and murder to exist the answer isn't simple. I don't know it. I don't. I'm having trouble wording this but religion is there and I would be willing to die for mine. I know that sounds extreme but it's true. I have a million and one thoughts in my head but I can't word them so if they come to me later I will return and re write/word this post. Good day and god bless.   I'm not saying there is but don't you think it would be better to say nothing than say something mean? Or at least try and say something nice. Obviously you have an opinion and I respect that but I don't agree with how you voice it.   All done, good luck with your project. When you get an A+ come back and let us know :) (no but seriously I hope you do well).   Thank you, so I should stop. Whenever I "finish" I feel horrible. It's like I know I've sinned but I chose to do it anyway.   I know how you feel, I lost my dog. I'll say a prayer for you just now. I do think that animals get into heaven. I don't believe God would create them simply to send them to hell and I definitely don't believe that they just rot. So that leaves me with the conclusion that they get into heaven.   I'll add you to my prayers :)   I'll pray for you :)      I'm not the best looking or the worst and I'm not saying looks aren't important but I would much rather spend time with a girl who was a bit ugly but had a great personality than a girl that looked great but had a not so great personality.   Ok so if someone isn't great looking you make them feel bad by swearing? If you thought they were ugly you shouldn't have said anything cause it hasn't made you or them feel any better.   I know a ton of people my age that party, I just don't really enjoy being around people I don't know (I'm kind of introvert but happy and confident around friends but put me in an uncomfortable social situation and I become a weird version of myself. If I like someone though I will ask her out after weeks of forcing myself to just say it). Yeah a lot of 15 year olds party just not very regularly.   That's horrible. They went to a dance and had fun people's looks don't matter and I wouldn't say either of them are ugly... [this](http://www.bing.com/images/search?q=fat+and+ugly FORM=HDRSC2#view=detail id=AF9B62FE4D44CEB1E87FEE2D874F29F5B93C03EA selectedIndex=116) is ugly!!  (By the way I wasn't joking neither of them are bad looking).   Good for you two, hope you both had fun :) ,   I never go out to parties :)   I know right!! (I used a kind of crappy app cause I was bored)   I want to be an archaeologist and I'm lucky cause I live in Scotland which still needs archaeologists. Failing that I want to study medicine and become a medical doctor. I also want to meet a girl, get married and have tons of kids but that can wait for a while :)   Dogs by far. They listen, play with you, spend time with you and will stand by you. Cats just sit there. I spend more time with my dogs than I do with people.   Thanks I found something that works for me :)   Although I'm not going to take it as a negative. I was twelve days though and as a teenager my hormones are already a mess so I was getting a lot of urges, for the most part I was able to fight them but then I said:   I know I'll feel crappy and I know this and I know that but I want to...  So after I did it (don't worry I never used porn) I said:  "Okay no big deal, just get back up and start again"  And that's what I intend to do. This time I'm going to beat twelve days. I'm going to get up dust myself down and try again. This is actually good because I learned from it and that's why I'm not going to get mad or angry at myself. I got overly confident, the first ten days were fine so I became cocky, no more. So I'll see you all when I get another (1) in my badge and then a (2) and all the way up. For now I'm going to take it one day at a time.   Nice post!! :D   I love(d) scrubs but I feel like it got pretty bad when J.D wasn't there for the last while. I mean they referenced him but it wasn't the same. I still loved every season.   I want to be an archaeologist, I guess here it's different. I don't really know many people that consider themselves "photographers".   I know what you mean. I guess I just never noticed it before but sex is everywhere. I love the movie bad teacher but when I watched it again for the first time in a year or so last week I got so turned on. There's a carwash scene that I used to just shrug off but it's weird to see just how sexual everything actually is.   A lot of people say that it takes 90 days (+-30) before you see any real benefits so you have two options.  * Quit and try and moderate it but just don't watch porn  * push through for one more month and take it from there.  Good luck :)   I can back this up, as a socially awkward "nerd" I had few friends and in one of my first classes in high school I was made to sit with some guys. They became my best friends and we hung out all the time. That was just by chance.    Thanks you two :)   Do you shave? Which moisturizer do you think is best?   Great review, you just got a new sub!! :D   I loved that game, still do I've completed every tomb raider made (besides the crappy game boy ports) :)   Are you just finding this out? Ah well pretty cool huh?   Ha, ha that got on my nerves!! :)   I have long hair so for me I couldn't do that but kudos!! :D   Yeah go for it, just don't let your parents find out and if they do tell them you like her and want to go out with her.   So the past 11 days have been kinda easy for me so I checked nofap frequently and constantly reminded myself why I wanted to do this. Then today I never really came here and I was fine through most of it. You know the saying:  "Sex sells"  Well because of porn I never really noticed this and when I was watching tv there were so many hot things that I used to just shrug off. At first I was fine I did the usual, remind myself why I was doing it and said will I fap? NO! Then did the 10-10-10 rule. I was fine but it got worse so I edged onced but stopped midway and said:  "Do I want to throw the last eleven days down the drain? Do I want to feel the regret later?" I stopped and listened to some music. I now know 100% why I'm doing this. So I'm happy to say I don't have to reset my counter today and I've learned from this. Thank you all for the motivation here on nofap.   Ok thanks :)   How short do you leave it? I shaved it but I'm fine with letting it regrow to a certain length. I do think that if it's short it looks like you're just starting puberty. On the flip side I have something that's stopped all itching, nivea men 48 hr for sensitive skin, it's stopped all itching.   Do you shave?   Nah but I just got sick of my pubes getting caught on my boxers is all.   Good luck!! :D   I can imagine what are you studying.   Do you shave?   I know right :)   Okay that's what I did thank you :)   I've already shaved. I did it in the bath. Shaving cream, stroke, under water and then repeat.   Don't worry I'm 15 I don't plan on sex for another few years   Oh... thanks anyway.   Ok thanks.   Ok do you/have you shave(d)? How can I prevent an itch?   ***UPDATE*** can I ask, what do girls prefer? I don't plan on having sex any time soon but I'm just wondering. I know it varies from girl to girl. If you are a girl what do you prefer and if you're a guy what do you do?   Yes but it wasn't in this sub. I've always wanted to be a doctor but I love history too and I spoke to an archaeologist and she really inspired me now I'm studying that and I'm very grateful to her.      I found out today someone even made a sub called /r/yesfap just to oppose this!!   All done, I'm 15 so I'm obviously a virgin   Don't reset your counter, dreams don't count :)   I love Jenna Marbles she's hilarious!!   Check out /r/nofap if you want to quit the masturbating.   Ha, ha there's a few reasons say it like this:  Fap-stro-naut sounds like fap so not. We won't fap.  We're doing something most people won't  And if we stop fapping our life can finally take off (like a rocket) we get more self esteem, energy etc, etc.   Good luck!! You can do it, here are a few [tips](http://m.imgur.com/cU848GQ) that might help you out. :)   I agree.   If I were you I'd go to a doctor or you could try /r/nofap that takes away anxiety and gives a lot of benefits. Still I suggest you see a doctor incase something's wrong.   I know that's true. I had a dream were I failed it was awful but I woke up and couldn't believe that I was still going I was happy and it reminded me how bad it could get if you give in.   Ha, ha great job, good luck aswell you can do it!! :D If you want them here are some [tips](http://m.imgur.com/cU848GQ) that might help you.   Hey I like your attitude. Here are a few [tips](http://m.imgur.com/cU848GQ) that might help you out. For music wise I suggest Clean bandit, they play instruments beautifully and when they work with Jess Glynn it comes out amazing!! Their songs 'Real Love' and 'Rather Be' are great. Good luck.   Ha, ha :D      I played it, I loved it and I never had to deal with them.   Ha, ha :)   Thanks :)   Aaaw :)   I see what you're saying.    If it did you wouldn't be able to move around your house.   I love jurassic park!!   No I'm not I wanted to stop because I saw on here all of the negatives and I didn't want become like that, before I started I was only fapping once or twice a week.    Things like gaming can be considered addiction as the it exhibits the same withdrawl symptoms as drugs, chocolate and coffee contain caffein and porn has negative effects on the brain.   I love music and learning too :)   Well I love halo :)   I play the keyboard, piano, drums and glock :)   Maybe it has nothing to do with nofap I would go to a doctor if I was you and take it from there but do mention nofap to him/her.   Oh well waters good for you :)   Ha, ha you are excused :)   I love music too what instrument(s) do you play?   Cool well happy hoarding.   Oh that's too bad I couldn't live without milk.   I LOVE chocolate milk I drink it everyday!! :)   /r/askreddit  /r/gaming  /r/nofap  /r/xbox  /r/xboxone  /r/movies  /r/funny  /r/pics  /r/explainlikeimfive   Milk's nice and oretty good for you I drink a lot of that.   I love the justice league!! :D you should do the next few after the suicide squad.   I'm not fat but I drink more milk than anyone I know and I love chocolate!! :D   That's good you can still drink them but just do it in moderation, it will be good for you too since they both contain tons of sugar and sweeteners.   Cool but really 13TB oh my god you must have a lot!! :)   Ha, ha I think that's the strangest I've heard yet but if you enjoy it who am I to judge :)   Me too, I'm on here a lot recently.   Ooooh me too :)   Ha, ha I buy xbox games to play them although I must admit I do love the smell of new shoes.   Ha, ha :) good luck    Ha, ha I don't think I will.  	119
 The CIA is really going overdrive on these counter-intelligence news stories.  i love it though.   "trying"    You're right. No hostage has ever been killed.  Ever.    http://gizmodo.com/oregon-was-founded-as-a-racist-utopia-1539567040   Its funny because Bill O'Reilly talks about how he grew up in Levittown but ignores the blatant red lining that prevented anyone who was a shade darker than him from moving in   Yeah you are. You're butthurt    This offends you so you can't grasp it being remotely true.    This must be the first time you've heard this. Go read about red-lining.    Simple question   Would the ends ever justify the means in any case when it comes to Iraq?         Yet when something happens, you'll claim the government didn't do enough    supposed beheading of James Foley  So where is his head?   Theres a lot of muslim countries just over the water who have individuals seeking asylum in Australia.  and muslims see themselves as all apart of the same tribe   How is it fear?  You all claim the intelligence agencies never do enough when things DO happen, yet claim you're being coerced into submission when they issue warnings.       I don't think geopolitics is fair.   Its kinda hard to stop them.   Cause North Korea and Pakisan said they'd stop and lied and went right ahead with it.   I only care about whats in the US's best interest.    Sarin attack...?    Still, why do you think the US should be able to kill anyone they want?  Its in the US's interest.      He's so lucky they didn't shoot his ass   Do you truly know who A.Q. Khan is and why what he did is so important?   Iran, don't forget what happened last time: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Praying_Mantis      Who is even getting that at this point?   Btw, saddam DID have a nuclear ambition at one point. He bragged about it.   Obviously he stopped though.    Does NYC need more train lines? If so, where?   Curious to see what NYCers think    "accept"   Uh...they didn't have a choice.    \*slow clap\*    Saudi Arabia an Pakistan have a "special" relationship.  Basically. Its on the border of Iran and its Sunni Islam.  Win-Win   I mean...after proof he got Pakistan and then North Korea, Iran, and at this point more-or-less Saudi Arabia...why is he still allowed to live?   Why haven't any intelligence organizations taken him out?  If WWIII starts, he'll be remembered right there with Gavrillo Princip    Its INFINITELY worse than Iran.   How many car parts do you need until you call it a car?   Exactly.  The whole "royalty" thing isn't going to last into the 21st Century   It sucks because it essentially makes it impossible to remove the royal family. ...which is urgently needed   I never understood why A Q Khan was never killed.  That dude is the Gavrillo Princip of WWIII   **Fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuu**      See, these types of gotcha-talking points don't fix anything in the present    Is this from the Taiwanese animators?   Pwned   What changes the NaCl from one place to another?    The studies are flawed.   See Islam, this is what happens.      Its so sad.  ATL could be on Boston/DC level   i.e. Atlantic Station and the entire Westside   In the 90s, it was THE place to go. It was always packed...now...well..               It doesn't mean they're secretly gay though.  Gays may be a scape goat, but its hard to get the general public educated about something that has been for thousands of years viewed as taboo in very traditional and poor societies .         http://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2015/05/12/fhritp-could-be-a-crime-say-toronto-police.html      and Mano would have messed it up         This is amazing to me.  here we have a BLATANT example of racism in action and people will jump through any hoop to justify the condition of black and brown people in the world   Some of these guys ARE NOT whistle-blowers.      In the age of google, how can you patently say such a stupid thing?  Africa is nothing IF NOT Christian and Muslim   The orthodox church runs russia now   Reddit said racism doesn't exist  Its just black people not trying hard enough.          Good.   Theres no proof of this.  All it said was the same unit...a unit composed of dozens of people.    Here is him doing All Day:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zy-u7gVBDIc   Governments always lie.   This isn't a big lie.    This is precisely what the problem was with Charles C Johnson.  I have no problem with having contemptible people on the show. none.  HOWEVER..Joe needs to do a better job of pushing back if he's going to have outright bad people on his show. If he doesn't, then he stands out as someone who looks like they're condoning it.   minimize?  hersch has done good work here, but you're acting like you learned a significant amount of information for that 10,000 word article.  Again...what changed here?  The SEALs didn't get into a massive shootout?  OBL didn't have a gun on him?  So?     That's a silly argument: up until very recently, "Western values" were decidedly anti-gay.  I didn't make it up  You have to understand this.  Gays and gay rights are seen as intrusions of western values and virulently opposed. You have to remember how skeptical a lot of these places are to any sort of outside influence, especially culturally at this point. ***To them***, being anti-gay is a positive aspect of their society.    Because they've been taught to feel that. People who are raised without the hatred, who have gay couples in their lives, do not feel "viscerally uneasy" in the slightest. The idea that people are born with hatred or "disgust" for same-sex interactions is utterly absurd.  I didn't say they were or were not taught anything. I'm telling how things are in different parts of the world.  You're not going to get anywhere by just thinking hitting over the head with your value systems will work without understanding why they're so stubborn to listen to you in the first place. So yeah, a lot of straight people aren't just drawn to images of gay people "being gay"...No matter how many gay people they have in their family or interact with. This isn't even about tolerance. Its about things you see that bother you. And a lot these cultures haven't had the references to understand how to view things they disagree with without respectfully disagreeing with it. Their answer is brutal repression and not tact or tolerance. Tolerance isn't something you find in 3rd world countries who can't even find the tolerance to fix their communities and solve overarching problems.    It doesn't run any "counter story"  It says the government struggled coming up with the finer details they wanted to release and that pakistan may have known about the raid itself  Big whoop  This isn't even that big of a revelation...unless they said OBL died in 1999 or something   **Do you really not understand this?**  Step outside if the ivory tower of liberal academia and step into the real and visceral world outside of your 1st world trappings  These people just HATE gays.   It has nothing to do with their insecurity. It has everything to do with religiosity and flat out disgust of gay people  Hell, most heterosexual people I know don't *love* gays...they tolerate them in the sense that "it doesn't bother me" and they don't want them to be persecuted. Most heterosexuals I know just generally ignore it. But that doesn't mean they enjoy watching two dudes kiss or anything. It does viscerally make people feel uneasy. But thats besides the point.   We're talking about cultures that haven't even secure the basics yet in the modern world...that are hyper-masculine (as a function of survival) and see any threat to the masculinity and thus perceived strength of their people as an utter and vile threat to the greater good.   This has NOTHING to do with secretly being gay.  This has NOTHING to do with being insecure with your sexuality.   Theres a reason the world map looks like this: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT_rights_by_country_or_territory  Most of the world really does not value western ideals and rejecting homosexuals is seen as tossing off the weight of "liberalism" and "secularism" in these very traditional and insular cultures and communities.  Does this mean you have to agree?  No.  But it DOES mean that you'll have to do A LOT better in coming up with quick one-word responses to anything a "homophobe" (and gays need a better word than homophobe to be honest) has to say with respect to gay rights.     If you define islam by its extremists, then yes, it is islam.  What informs the extremists beliefs?   I can't hand you a physics book and ask you to be a *moderate* about it    I ask why and he tells me because it is only "gay" if you are the one receiving or fall in love with the man.   Thats fascinating    Same with Russia now   Actually, its not.  People just actually hate gays...and they don't see it as it having no effect on their lives. They see it as something they reject and want to not have to deal with it. I'm not a homophobe or anything so this doesn't bother me, but if you don't understand how they think or why they think it, you'll forever be confused.   There are lazy arguments about AIDS and pedophilia and general visual discomfort in viewing gays in public that pervade all anti-gay societies around the world  Not every person who hates gays craves gay sex. Its stupid to even think that.    Did you even read Seymour's article?  We're bickering over stuff that isn't even that big of a deal!  OK. How many people were in the room? How many bullets we're fired? Did Pakistan know or not?  Who cares?  1. A raid happened  2. Bin Laden Died  3. US Intel led up the manner  The gist of the story is still the same.      Honestly, these "lies" aren't even lies.  I don't even see what the big deal is   So?   Yet this hasn't even come out. So whats really the big deal?  Clearly the Seal team had some answers for us since they had a convenient accident a short time later.   SEAL Teams have hundreds of members and train all the time.    Actually, the details aren't even that different.  Calling it a "lie" is ridiculous.  We're just discussing the color of the tablecloth at this point   Fabulous    OR...he just hates gays.   You gotta stop thinking people who hate gays secretly crave penis   **We should abandon this notion that anyone who hates gays is therefore secretly gay**.  Is it true in many cases? Absolutely.  But there is a culture within Africa and ex-colonial states around the world (partly due to colonialism) that views western social values as vestiges of oppression and colonialism and emasculation...and anti-homosexuality is seen as an effort to regain a sense of confidence and stability in society. I  have heard the arguments too ranging from "The greeks brought homosexuality to africa" and "gays keep AIDS around" and the very common "gays aren't real men"...and you have to understand that these are just people who are trying to deal with the basics in life (the average citizen) and having to then conform to these notions of gender and try to maintain a degree of tolerance while doing so is VERY difficult.   I'm not saying its right, but you have to understand this. It goes far beyond secretly "hating yourself"    The same one that used to stop black progress?   I'm just as much a nihilist as you...but really?  You might as well criticize how money works...or anything really.               Its so funny when data comes out the way you don't like it, then it must be some OTHER cause.  Black men have been dumped on by the US in extraordinary ways and it seems Reddit can't handle it          the CIA/federal government wasn't exactly interested in upholding global white supremacy.   LOL  Do you KNOW who J Edgar is?   Do you not know what the beef between allopathy and osteopathy is?   Do you want to ignore how racist the US has been?  Then pretend its not a factor?   You're really naive.    Deepak Chopra is hiring       transcendent minds.  This phase isn't going to help you win this discussion    Just 2 inches at a time bro. Everyone does it    #3232;_ #3232;   Its LITERALLY the same thing   what whistle was blown here?          Just look at some of the blog posts on there.  This guy is insane      You might as well just pick up some random snacks at your local drug store   Would him being 78 have something to do with it?  I'm sensing a bit of a Linus Pauling syndrom here...   *This spring I contacted Durrani and told him in detail what I had learned about the bin Laden assault from American sources: that bin Laden had been a prisoner of the ISI at the Abbottabad compound since 2006; that Kayani and Pasha knew of the raid in advance and had made sure that the two helicopters delivering the Seals to Abbottabad could cross Pakistani airspace without triggering any alarms; that the CIA did not learn of bin Ladens whereabouts by tracking his couriers, as the White House has claimed since May 2011, but from a former senior Pakistani intelligence officer who betrayed the secret in return for much of the $25 million reward offered by the US, and that, while Obama did order the raid and the Seal team did carry it out, many other aspects of the administrations account were false.*   #So whats the problem here?          Why wouldn't they be? Do you think the internet is just for non-government employees?   See...I trust them on foreign issues...but domestically I just laugh.    This is gonna get REAL interesting...      Yes.  Wtf is going on?   Except, it didn't  Zimmerman picked a fight.   Lost  Then shot the guy kicking his ass.    Lets ask Trayvon...   I don't understand how you look at yourself in the mirror and think zimmerman's story holds up that travyon attacked him   Theres no evidence he was ambushed outside of him starting whatever fight that occurred.  No teenage boy I know who is on the phone with a girl making a run to the corner store will stop to engage in fisticuffs.    Thug?  You mean Zimmerman?   This is precisely why I truly believe Trayvon did NOT start that damn fight. It makes no sense.  Yes. Zimmerman lost that fight initially and shot Trayvon...but I've never seen a situation like this before.    Where are their fathers?   Putin's gonna ice this dude   anything in the city is consistently minimum 250/night  Unless you want to shack up in either a 4-star hotel asking 300+/night or end up on a ring highway    Thugs.   I mean...REALLY?   Is demand that high or do you just love gouging people for the hell of it?        Go.    I hope everyone would already know this   Could easily be a book or movie                        Yep. This is how Tamir Rice got killed.   This is precisely how/why Tamir Rice got killed   he's apparently really active still. He was the one who revealed Apple and Google were recording location data 5 years ago   The hacker is the one behind: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samy_(computer_worm)         BTW before this video was released, the friends of the man who got shot was a victim...not the perpetrator   https://youtu.be/pBso7E__Y68  They lied about EVERYTHING      Theres 1.5 billion muslims   Nice statistically insignificant anecdote    There are sects of Islam where effigies of Mohammad are fine  name one.   Understatement   Do they not have any Persian art?         Redban. Is. An. Idiot.   Great Episode      It DID however put one suspect on probation for trying to go to a terrorist training camp 5 years ago.  You can't arrest someone with pre-crime e.g. "you're going to jail because we think you'll try and kill infidels 5 years from now"   Why isn't it possible for ISIS to have done this?  1. muslims get mad at mohammed pics  2. young angry muslims see whats going on online and want to join in  3. just so happens one of the suspects was being tracked by the feds for trying to go to an overseas camp....   The NSA is getting so saturated with data that it's become useless for actually stopping, avoiding and lowering the essential reason it was created for: terrorism/acts of violence in America.  This isn't true.  See, predicting crime is hard unless you truly catch someone in the act. In Texas last week, the problem was that one of the suspects was already on probation essentially for being tracked to going overseas to train at a camp...but you can't arrest someone for suspicion of committing an terrorist act in the future.    ISIS as an islamic jihadist mindset predicates itself on worldwide domination  By asserting that they're "present" it helps them recruit.    How is this a conspiracy? Is it unreasonable young angry muslim men  live in the US?       How much would that cost?  Doesn't matter.      Sure   Ask it to tell you which planes are overhead    How is he wrong?  These young men aren't posting benign content to their Facebook pages.    Wouldn't it save us SO much more in the long run just to send a message of unity and progress and remove all of these bureaucratic barriers if we didn't have to focus on these meaningless boundaries?   Its SO frustrating.  ATL could AT LEAST resemble Boston. DC if we were ambitious.   But no.  They CONTINUALLY stand in the way of literal progress in the metro area.   This is why I suggest ATL just cannibalize everything inside 285 and be done with it.    It was supposed to go out to freaking GRIFFIN     The Hawks are arguably the most innovative in the league in terms of fan -experience      He probably helped build a few of them   See, this is why NO policy changes are made.  None.       This is HARD!   Brilliant      You can't really blame him. Thats what consulting and private equity tends to do.   Sounds like Mitt Romney    I should have the right to do any drug I damn well please as long as doing so doesn't effect anyone else.   drug use, regardless has absolute public health implications    He's cleaned up the streets though. His record doesn't lie.    People wouldn't poke fun if muslims weren't so quick to get mad   What is islamophobia?   	190

 Why do you say so?    Wtf motherland calls ought to be a wonder!   Droidippy mate!   Thanks, an excellent explanation. For some reason I'm more familiar with the last terms than the first ones :p You're amazing thanks!   No one mentioned the intelligent investor?   From house of cards, "the anti-nuclear argument is purely emotional, with no rationale or logic supporting it". I'm paraphrasing.   Vive la France! :D   Should be similar as to like total war (where different rates of taxation earn you money, but stifle food, science, happiness). But similarly, economics in civ has always been non-existant. So much more could be added.   Could someone please explain what that means? The language is a bit too complicated for a mere mortal like me..  :'(   LifeLad   Amazing answer, but could you please explain the first paragraph (standard deviation part). Learning it in my math lessons and would love to understand how it links to this situation.    "There is risk that our increasingly communist government will confiscate everything in sight. " LOL     Can you explain in more detail please?   Holy f*ck what an amazing answer. I only understood like 30% of what you said, but wow, thanks so much! I will dive into all the things you talked about to try and formulate some sort of educates respons, but can you start by telling me what is kurtosis? That ks so much!   SL. Thought of going up, but was too late. Get 90%+ in all tests.   Hey r/investing! I have to write a mathematics essay (Math Internal Assessment for the IB), and at the moment I am trying to formulate a question. Since the stock market is very interesting, I was curious, what mathematics is used to "predict" share price movements. Any relatively complex maths is enough, even if it is completely wrong (I assume many mathematics formulaes, etc. in predicting the stock market are wrong). Any help would be helpful! Thanks so much!   Just shows the new lows Russia has reached. Being a Russian, it hurts :'(   I don't know about most, but nuking is certainly up there :D   even to (any country) in "x years" the (country) would look alien in "x years +400). Go an read more about the actual religion and culture the (country) and people dressed and what they did for fun and compare that to (country) during the days of (any leader in year year x). It is a continuation but it changed more that enough to be called a different.  I suggest France as a good country. But can apply to pretty much any country. Not trying to argue here, just pointing out that this argument you put forward can be applied to almost any country.   I thought I was going to have an amazing well argued response that will change my view for the better and open up a new world in investing for me. Pity all I got is you seeing HR... :D   Please don't down vote, imagine its moronic Monday. Why is this statement bad? Sure, the NIKKEI and others have remained stagnant for long times, but most have increased. Over a life time (I'm 17), isn't that good advice? Sorry for any stupidity, CMV.   Thank you so much :)   Why can't we be proud of being terran? Its like, if a race wins, it has to be putten down. Terran master race, haters gonna hate.   Dat spearman tho   Oh my god :O Wrong link :'D Thanks for pointing it out!   	25
 Thank you and I'm glad to see you have taken those extra steps, in life, to ensure your safety, as well as others!    I know all to well what you are talking about and find it quite unfortunate that Brownback (and the Koch brothers) have chosen this route.   After serving an AmeriCorps term and working at Harvesters - Community Food Network, I have had first hand experience working with families in need. With all the govt. shutdown nonsense affecting recipients of WIC, this will only create more problems for these families and the life and well-being of (KS) citizens.           Neither do a lot of college students. Though that's due to ignorance, more so than zero awareness.    Surprised no one has mentioned contraceptives. Isn't that one of the basic reasons Republicans wouldn't accept the Affordable Care Act (or at least it was highly publicized as a reason)? Seems ridiculous but then again, they also think it's necessary to accept rape.  Ok so that went from funny to sad, I do apologize. But only to non-Republicans. Otherwise you guys suck, and by suck, I mean your own balls.     Wow, based on the original post, I wasn't expecting such harsh criticism.   It is great to see a 'sneaky frat guy' actually showed respect for a drunken female. This DOES NOT mean all frat guys behave the same way. I've had my fair share of run ins with college douchebags, so I know.  As so, I have respect for this individual - - not all frat guys.  Oh and my brother is an alumni of a fraternity, so I have respect for those I know are actual gentleman.  Edit: Corrected a typo.   Finally have some sense of respect for frat guys. Let me emphasize some, not all.       Wow, that was one nostalgic moment! I'd sit in my Dad's office for hours playing this - PC version.    Abe   Jake's closed, Quintons must have gotten old and Fatsos might have the same turnout. That leaves all the hipster bars on Mass. Sadly, they chose Jazzhaus as their new mating grounds.    All the cool bartenders left, karaoke night turned into a group of frat boys screaming to a song on stage (not just during the summer), plus the quality of drinks changed, too. If you can't make a proper martini, don't work at the Jazzhaus.   Ahhh back in the day. Oh wait, that was only a few years ago.      Jazzhaus use to be cool, now it's 'bro central'.    My first camping trip was at Woodridge! Can't wait go camping again and this time around, we'll be sure to collect more wood for the fire!!    Ok so, maybe nerve-wracking wasn't the best word choice, but it is quite annoying!    We're backwards in these here states.   Will admit though, it's quite nerve-wracking when reading a date and not realizing the switch.   Didn't know any famous people, directly, but went to school for a few years with Kristie Alleys' niece and Kevin Bacons' brother/cousin was a teacher and coach at my high school. I'm not sure of the exact relationship, but he looked a lot like Kevin - almost identical.    Am I the only one who can't access the entire story? So far I can only read through Part 2: The Dangers.   Otherwise the browser won't respond. Not sure if it was a problem with my laptop or Reuters' site.      With most inserted objects (graphs, pics, etc), you must select the object and change its layout on the page.   It's not Microsoft Word, you just do not understand how to use it.   Your cat is doing that out of pure enjoyment/pleasure. It's not the same for the other kitty;  poor thing is scared!    The finished dish smells a lot like a pizza and tastes like a lasagna; with a quiche texture and a crust.           That's why they built White House | Black Market. If shoes aren't enough, over-priced clothes will do.    Bros don't mate naturally, they use roofies.    That's what makes this such a great recipe! It doesn't relate - 100% - b/c the rice isn't prepared separately. But a pan isn't wasted b/c the rice is prepared along with the stock (vegetable or chicken), spices, onions, and tomatoes.   Welcome! :-)   From the cookbook *The Food of Spain* by Claudia Roden.     From the cookbook *The Food of Spain* by Claudia Roden.   *The Food of Spain* by Claudia Roden   Awww come on now, don't be hating. It's from the cookbook '**The Food of Spain**' by Claudia Roden.     Here are two sites you might want to check out:  1.  Migraine Associated Vertigo (MAV)  (http://vestibular.org/migraine-associated-vertigo-mav).  2. Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo (BPPV) (http://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/neurology_neurosurgery/specialty_areas/vestibular/conditions/benign_paroxysmal_positional_vertigo.html)   From March 2008-July 2013 I was misdiagnosed as having Menieres. After receiving little assistance from my ENT, I decided to try and manage my dizziness on my own. This was quite a challenge given the fact I still didnt understand why I was dizzy.  Within the past year I decided I wanted to get rid of, or at least try to treat, this problem. After doing a lot of research for specialists in my area, I came across an Audiologist not far from here. After the first round of testing, my previous diagnosis turned out to be wrong. Through these tests alone, it was determined that I had Migraine Associated Vertigo (MAV). Coincidentally I suffered from chronic migraines (diagnosed as depression) throughout high school (Sophomore - Senior year) and had a few years of 'relaxation' (3 years) until the vertigo spells started. The culprit? ***STRESS***   After coming to this conclusion, I still had to take into consideration that once I started having dizzy spells, I too lost the ability (equilibrium wise) to play sports, run, dance, etc. My life went from being a fun, energetic college student, to a recluse. I could no longer stand this and spoke to my Audiologist about this very problem. He introduced me to the Vestibular Therapist in the office and after only a months work, Im no longer dizzy and my ears stopped ringing (experienced Tinnitus 24 a day/ 7 days a week for the past 5+ years). If my ears start to ring, its usually a sign that my bodys telling me to stop, and relax.    If you happen to have another cat, this breed tends to be territorial. Found this out after watching a few episodes of 'My Cat from Hell', and my mom just assumed it couldn't be fixed. Unforunately, it would have been an easy thing to do- had I only known at the time. She made me get rid of Bella after having her for only 2 years.  But..on to the good stuff:  Such a great breed, especially if you're in the mood for a playful, energetic and lovable kitty! Congrats!! :-D      Looking at the cats eyes and how she digs her claws into the carpet, it's a clear sign she's terrified and trying to protect her kitten and not acting cute.   Is it worth an 'aww'? Perhaps...but I still feel sorry for the cat.    Say hello to the 'Persian Death Stare'.    Thai Siam is great - instead of getting the usual Zen Zero or Encore.   Merc deli is great (and Ingredient, too), but a bit on the pricey side. Same with Wheatfields, but their sandwiches are to die for!   If she's in the mood for Falafel (restaurant opened by an owner of the Hookah House) be sure to check out Lebanese Flower on Mass St. They also serve hummus and other great food!    Watch episodes of The French Chef...she teaches you how to properly chop, cut, dice, etc.   Oh and the key to not crying - - make sure your knife is sharp!    If I recall correctly, she's a Blue Tabby Persian - but without all the hair!       No prob! :-)   It's a normal thing for Persian cats. They always get gooey stuff in their eyes! Perks for having a flat face....      Into the Vietnamese Kitchen: Treasured Foodways, Modern Flavors   http://vietworldkitchen.typepad.com/blog/into_the_vietnamese_kitchen.html   Oh yeah, should have mentioned that:  Soak the amount for 30min in cold water and be sure to rinse through.   We used dried Shiitake mushroom that were already chopped up, but still had to remove a few stems from the reconstitutes mushrooms.

Sorry for the delay, but the recipe can be found here:  http://imgur.com/a/SI2VO   The dish is topped with flat-leaf parsley and parmesan cheese.    I'll post the recipe tomorrow! :-)      Knowing the characteristics of breeds helps keep incidents like this from happening. He's clearly a breed that loves affection and requires maintenance - grooming.  I have a pure-bred Persian. She's adorable as hell, but lacking in personality and requires daily grooming. It's what you typically expect from the breed.   There are several stores about an hour from where I live. I've thought about stopping by, but I figured it would work best to receive tips via Reddit, before going. Would definitely give me a clearer idea of where to start  shades, products, etc.   Not to mention, I could call ahead to see if they even carry the product. Last thing I would want to do is drive there and not be find what I need!            I've thought about permanent brows, but I'll need to do more research before commiting to something like that. As for the scar, most people don't...it's more of the reason why I wore makeup in the first place, so it continues to a main focus. Thanks for your tips!    Ahh yes, fine words  once shared by Jenna Marbles! I'm trying not to be such a perfectionist when drawing them out - just need to follow such words of advice! :-)   Thank you for your tips! I'll be sure to check out MAC products! :-)    Wow, thanks! Those actually look a lot like my 'natural' brow. But not as thick! I'll be sure to check out the tutorials and products. Thanks!    Thank you so much for your post. And yes, it made me smile! I like knowing when someone else has a clearer idea of where I'm coming from!    I tried using Anastasia but always had problems getting my brows to match. Since everyone keeps suggesting the product, I might go ahead and try it again.   Thank you! :-)   I've allllllways worn lipglosses and the like, but I wanted to look more 'grown up'. I'm the size of a kid (i.e. under 5ft) and looking older, helps out a lot!    This is when scaring becomes an issue. I've spoke and met with the surgeon I've used since I was a child, and scaring (on the left side) makes doing that, difficult. Not to mention I'm 'supposed' to get brow lifts to compensate for the lack of (normal) tissue on the left side of my face. Lol wow I know that probably came as a surprise! My situation is just too darn complicated! :-P BUT I still thank you for your advice!    Wow, I can't believe the number of replies! I really appreciate everyone's comments and will do what I can to reply over the next fee days! Thank you so much! :-)   I use a neutral concealer and a natural lite liquid fondation, but I'll be sure to try brighter lipsticks/lip glosses! Thank you! :-)   lol sorry. That wouldn't be the first time I got it wrong. Thanks for clearly that one up!    Oh eyebrows...once upon a time I had great eyebrows. Nice thickness and shape, but I was in high school and getting your eyebrows waxed was cool. So I went in and she took off too much - and well---- they never grew back (on both sides). On the left side (in the before picture) all visible brow was medically inserted years ago, to ensure I still somewhat had an eyebrow. It worked, for the most part, but transplanting hair (from say your head) to your face, it doesn't grow like facial hair....at all. Drawing them on hasn't been a great experience b/c I use to draw on a brown line and thought that would suffice. No wonder I received a lot of stares. Now I have a better idea of how they should look, just do not know how to go about drawing them!   OMG thank you for mentioning the winged eyeliner! I never could figure out how people did that!   I'll be sure to look more into that, as well as the lipsticks! :-)   I've thought about using vibrant colors - such as purple - but always dreaded the idea of buying makeup that wouldn't be used! Thanks for the tip! :-)   I tried stenciles, but couldnt get the brows to match - height, shape, etc. Due in part to the scaring. I just trace the area out with an eyebrow pencil and fill it in with brown eyeshadows. Just using what I've had to get by!    Due to my skin tone, I can't find a color that really fits. Anything too dark or too light makes it the only thing you see, or directs attention to my eyes. It's quite a challenge...   I know, I know..then try something in-between. I have, and it's still overpowering :-/   I've watched Youtube videos, and the like, for eyebrow tutorials, but it's easier said than done. Scaring makes drawing them on quite a challenge! I'll have a correct arch and shape (for my right eyebrow) but can't figure out how to replicate that for the left side. Have any tips?   Scaring certainly makes me self-conscious and I have even looked in to Dermabrasion, but it won't work the same for me as for others. Due to thinner skin (i.e. skin graft) plus missing bone tissue, muscle, etc, hiding such scars is quite a challenge.  Thank you for your kind words of advice! :-)    When dealing with blush, I either can't see it or it's too overpowering. Can't seem to find a brand that compliments my skin tone.   Eyeshadow is quite a bit different. As you can see, I have scaring above my left eye. More so, my entire eyelid consists of a skin graft. This makes applying eye makeup to be quite a challenge. Especially when I want to do something colorful and creative. Sorry, I should have made that problem more clear from the start.   Cellphone pics are quite a challenge when smiling! Spent close to 20min trying to take the before and after pics. Since there's a lot of scaring, by not smiling, you're able to see what I'm working with a little better.   Lip color - ugh, that's a whole new challenge. I like light colors (i.e light pink, light bronze, just a shimmer, etc.) By not working much with lipsticks, etc. I haven't found a color that matches well. Or I find that it's too overpowering.    Thanks for your tip! :-)   I've tried darks and lights (hair color) but never seem to know what to do with my overall makeup. Even tried dirty-blonde-streaks back in high school, and to be honest, it looked ridiculous. I also knew very little about makeup, so that's possibly a reason.   lol I even owned a bronzer brush and whatever else, but never figured out how to use it (no one would ever show me!!!!). I also use primer - thanks in part to my boyfriend's advice, and it does help quite a bit!   Thanks for your tips! :-)   Thank you for letting me know! Since there isn't a 'makeup advice' subreddit, I wasn't sure where to post!   Here's the link to the new post:  http://www.reddit.com/r/MakeupAddiction/comments/1ca7ao/i_need_makeup_advice_posted_a_before_and_after/   My story:   I was hit by a car when I was a child (3 years of age - 1989 to give you a better idea of the time). Following the accident, I was both mentally and physically impaired. Both of which were apparent to the average person. As so I sought help via plastic surgery (and education...but that's another story). That is a lot to go through as a child and I am doing whatever possible to not seek help from that 'source of perfection'.   That is why I am here.   As you can see, I am rather pale, must draw on eyebrows, and the like, on a daily basis. No matter what I do, I cannot retain much color to my face. Over the past few months, I have experimented with different eye shadows and blush, but nothing seems to work. Also considered changing my hair color, but brown eyes make pairing quite a challenge. (i.e. I LOVE the woman's hair in the Wendy's commercials, but she also has blue eyes, so I'm not so sure if it would work.)   If you have any advice, please feel free to share!

If not, that's fine. Just thought I'd ask before searching! :-)   Thanks for providing me another reason to fear wasps - wasp invasion!!!!   We stored some in the fridge and fry up 2/3 cup, or so, when we want another. Quick, easy, and delicious!    Haha I wondered if someone was going to ask that. It's quite savory, but you're more than welcome to add something sweet. Actually think my boyfriend did that for lunch!    Edit: yeah I'm not too sure about adding maple syrup. It's too savory of a pancake. It's served with a Tahini Sauce but you have to like sesame seeds.    Tip:  Oh and only make what you plan to eat. Not as great when reheated.   Also, if you are wondering about the taste. I'm horrible at describing these things, but the main flavors are curry and garlic.

Plus, this helps show that we eat more than just salads! :-)   Oh and only make what you plan to eat. Not as great when reheated.    Whoa there, normal eater? I'll let that one slide......

Thanks for the tip!    Her eyes get like that throughout the day. Would have cleaned them, but I didn't want to make her mad.   	107
 This might be his masterpiece, but Se7en is still my favorite. Zodiac has a limited number of rewatches, Se7en I can watch whenever.   Ok I'm sorry   No wonder so many Leon medical centers have sprung up lately   Gonna read this. Had never heard of it.   I like to imagine the setting myself. Unless its incredibly important to the story, can't the reader just infer from the situation where the  characters are?   I read The Road this year after having attempted it a couple years ago. I loved it. I don't know if to read Blood Meridian or No Country For Old Men because Ive already seen the movie. How similair is it to the movie?   c-cc-c-c-c-c-c-cccombo breaker. Shits not chill at all   Link?   Yea, only drink I get when I go there.   The book was. Idk about the adaption.   No, a major plot point is that hes getting older, so I would recommend watching it at least a week after the others. Preferably three years after.   Fun fact, Quantum of Solace is the most expensive film ever by the  minute. It was just a really expensive epilogue to Casino Royale. edit. wrong word   Cats Cradle is my favorite of his, followed by Sirens of Titan.    Michael Chabon "Wonder Boys" enjoying it a lot. Ernest Hemmingway "Farewell to Arms", taking my time with this one, perfect breakfast reading.   He runs a Nazi memorabilia shop.   Manhattan Love Story is surprisingly enjoyable and clever.   New Girl is hilarious, at least the first two seasons. You're just hating.      Your kid wins at Halloween   Literally watching "The Secret Life of Walter Mitty" right now and I'm loving it.   Brad Bird outweighs Lindelof though, so who cares.   Holy shit me too. I was 12 or 13 and I had just got a TV in my room, I channel surfed until I hit upon HBO and a movie was about to start. I said why not, and Collateral happened. It was my favorite movie for a long time.   You speak Arabic? Sounds like you can definitely get a good job   You already saw the whole joke.   I've been in six car accidents! Two ended up completely wrecking the car I was in.   Only four where my fault.   Just graduate. Senior year is young adult day care   I was so glad when the detailer gave me the option for AG. Forgot about tuition assistance...   I'm in DEP for Aerographers Mate, shipping out in 2015. Wondering what exactly goes down in the Navy when on shore duty. Everything on the internet is usually about sea duty.

Career criminals are the worst, and more needs to be done in this country to help youths make better decisions.

Who's your favorite?   Buy an ereader.  I have a Kindle Paperwhite and I now read 5 times more books.   Sirens of Titan and CatS Cradle are my favorites. Mother Night is my least favorite.   "Horns" by Joe Hill. I read "Heart Shaped Box" last week and enjoyed it very much so now I have to read his whole bibliography. I like that he seems to have grown up with the same pop culture I did, so I understand all the reference's he makes. Liking his style more than Kings.   I've seen The Mexican on TBS like 4 times in the last ten years.   Reddits not a waste of time though. Think of it as a free MMO community college with courses on any topic and where anyone can be teacher or student. If you reddit correctly you can learn a lot of stuff for free.   On a dead celebrity binge?   If you like Gone Girl you might as well read her two other novels, Sharp Objects and Dark Places. Both have female protagonists that seem real.   Do you recommend ET to someone who's never worked with electronics before?    Dark Places was good too   The Road. Its narrative and strange word choice made 17 year old me give up quick, until four years later when i gave it a second shot. Finished it in one night. Amazing novel.   God yes. I was utterly destroyed when an ex of mine three days after breaking up with me showed up on my feed as in a relationship.   Whenever a server asks me how much creme or sugar and I say none, I try to keep the coolest face I can   "look at that guy, he's a real man, not afraid of anything"   Black because I like tasting the coffee and not the creme.  Also, because I hope someone notices and thinks its cool.    That's not what it means. Its how high you are, not how much you smoked.   Expendables 4   They already did with Casino Royale   I only had a small injury on one of my fingers, but it was years ago. Vision and hearing are great too, and I am in very great physical shape.   I really cant wait until I'm swore in. I think about it all day. This wait is stressing me out.  Positive thoughts.   I took my asvab yesterday, all I need is my physical and a drug waiver now. So am I basically in? I hope so, I've been stressing it a lot.   I was thinking Batista   Damn gurl you normmmall.  Nam sayin   It was necessary to make more money, which is what the film industry is about.    Read Sirens of Titan, what I believe Hitchhikers to be based off of.   Read this book throughout a road trip. Its like the only thing I remember from the trip.    So you bought 4 shares?   WAIT WE HAVE THIS TECHNOLOGY?   I also want to know. I can only afford one.   Was Bling Ring good? I'll Netflix it if it is   The one with legal murder.   The Road and The Stranger. Not because they were great, they were, but because they're really short.

 Did I say they weren't a threat? No, I didn't.  I was simply pointing out the ridiculousness of your assertion that they "almost won".   Please tell us more about how they were winning before the allies decimated their entire empire. Tell us about how these competent leaders dragged their country and citizens into an unwinnable unsustainable military campaign that ultimately resulted in the fracturing of their country and the nearly total destruction of its infrastructure.   Tell us how it was an entirely competent decision to wage an invasion against the Soviets. Explain how in their great wisdom and cunning strategic logic they came to form an alliance with a belligerent and ideologically diseased state like prewar Japan, and how that state waged an antagonistic bombing campaign against the United States effectively bringing them into the war. Tell us about these "great leaders".    Yes! Thank you. Allying with Japan was also a huge mistake.    It's getting really heated in there. I was just asked if I'm stupid because   Incompetent leaders wouldn't have almost won against all the superpowers of the world. The Nazis were fucking evil, and I am glad they lost. They were competent as hell though.  That's hilarious.      Are you stupid?   Incompetent leaders wouldn't have almost won against all the superpowers of the world. The Nazis were fucking evil, and I am glad they lost. They were competent as hell though.  Bwahaha!   Edit: Sorry, I just got carried away by the ridiculousness of your comment. Please tell us more about how "They almost won against all of the superpowers of the world".     The Third Reich manifested during peace time. It's not stupid to look at these things with an* honest and transparent attitude.      No I'm not. And they're often interrelated.    They should change the instructions in the sidebar.    You are an apologist if you honestly believe that the Third Reich was comprised of competent leadership. Waging a two front war against all of the world's superpowers? Forming an alliance with belligerent bloodthirsty Japan? The fucking Holocaust? All of the backward hateful rhetoric that was used by the Reich from its inception? There are countless cases of incompetence within the party and throughout the war.       I suppose you think that "drug dealers" aren't people and therefore shouldn't have any rights?    Many would argue that Germany's actions leading up to and during the war were little more than drunken belligerence. During the final days the Reich and the Wermacht destroyed as much infrastructure as they could in order to prevent the allies from using it. It's disingenuous Nazi apologia to suggest that somehow Germany was less responsible for it's postwar state than Greece is for it's current problems.    I disagree. You cited one example of a Jamaican citizen and two other black gentlemen who were commissioned officers (a lieutenant is not a senior officer) but were then dismissed to join the Union Army early in the war. The 1,500 or 2,000 black soldiers and three black officers would have been prohibited from serving in the confederacy in 1862 and your source says that 10% of them went and joined the Union Army.   You don't have an argument. You either don't understand military rank structure or you're willing to ignore glaring contradictions in your narrative in order to maintain it. Three low ranking officers who served very shortly before being disbanded would not have qualified in any manner as "senior military officers". By the end of the war these men would have been American war heroes, not defeated Confederates. But I encourage you to continue your efforts. Maybe while reading about these men and others like them you'll learn a thing or two about how evil the Confederate leadership really was.    Don't you mean that Germany was limping for getting into a drunken brawl that they in fact started? Then, once they realized they were sure to lose they began burning their cloths and effects so that no one else could have access to them?    When the Louisiana State Legislature banned people of color from serving in the Confederate Army in February 1862, the regiment was disbanded. Morris and about 10% of the other former 1st Louisiana Native Guard joined the Union Army in September 1862 and were organized into a new unit that was assigned the same name. There Morris became the first black Jewish officer in the Union Army.   Hmm. Got any other great examples?    "nor the greedy". So when will Christians start their campaign to disenfranchise and marginalize the rich?    Federal authorities raided the home of Subway spokesman Jared Fogle Tuesday morning. FBI sources told FOX59 state and federal investigators were serving warrants at Fogles Zionsville home in connection with a child pornography investigation.

AA is not a [therapeutic] (http://www.propublica.org/article/how-alcoholics-anonymous-can-be-a-playground-for-violence) environment for alot of people. Beyond being predatory the twelve step system is also not an [effective drug or alcohol treatment program, ] (http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/does-alcoholics-anonymous-work/)  it is a fundamental violation of our first amendment rights as many people are pushed into twelve step whether they're religious or not. Jesus is the most common* topic of discussion for many twelve step groups. This is an everyday violation of our constitutionally protected religious rights, but you don't hear anyone stopping or backing up governmental process over it.  Edit: I'm a huge supporter of gay rights, but I feel that all human rights depend on secularism.    I chose* this one because (as you can see) this officer proclaims to be a part of a "we"  that has a contract to "clean up the site". If anyone has anything to say about this select group of users "cleaning up the site" this would be the place and time.    Started a new sub.   Ideally, this would be a place to discuss the police and the bullshit they spew on pns. I would be open to allowing apologia from other corners of reddit as long as we follow the .np and archive rule. No direct links ever! We can't have a simple conversation with people staring over our shoulders and I won't tolerate them. This is designed to be a circle jerk and that it will be.       Like I said. Strict rules. No direct linking, no brigading. If you're interested in moderating, get in touch. Otherwise, have fun.   Edit: Thanks for your support. Sub is up and running. If there's a way, could you please give me access to those archives you removed. My sub is only for archives and .Np contributions. I've contacted /u/insaneterrorist. I hope that he digs what I'm trying to get going. Thanks again.    Please direct those users to contribute to /r/shitpnssays. I'll do my best to keep this conversation alive.   It's new. The .np and archive rule is nonnegotiable I will ban you. Otherwise, Come one, come all. If you'd like to moderate please get in touch. /r/shitpnssays   I don't disagree with you, but hear me out. /r/shitredditsays is a self-professed, unapologetic circlejerk. They ban anyone who tries to stop the jerk and even those who don't want to jerk. They're protected by the rules of reddit because they ban folks who attack the topic of conversation. They describe their sub as a "turd museum". "Don't touch the turds.". That's  cool that you want to change this sub. I'm still planning on starting my sub. I hope that you'll promote on mine as I'd like to promote on yours.    I agree. I don't consider myself an expert in theology, but I'd say that greed has been a tool of the leaders of western Christianity for forty or fifty years at least. When we talk about the US, I'm pretty sure we can walk back all the way to the very beginning and see greed as the singular motivation in most things.    I just checked it out. Are you referring to all of the memes? Maybe I'll start a ~~/r/shitprotectandservesays~~ /r/shitpnssays later.    Yeah that's him. His videos are very informative.    Thank you for being so candid. It's not common for believers to speak honestly about these offenses which may not affect literally every church but are extremely common.    Is he the body guard guy who always has his lawyer waiting by the phone? His videos are awesome. He really knows what he's doing and doesn't fuck around. Those are how first amendment audits ought* to be conducted.    Shouldn't you have included some text or even a source?    Yeah I would be more supportive of banning brigadiers and removing the downvote button than censoring content to protect the feelings of a few butthurt piggy-wiggies.    What about conversations where officers are flippant about the law, joke about harming people, or blatantly ignore or ridicule constitutional rights?    Apparently she's been very clear that has every intention of keeping the position.    I guess "cleaning up the site" means* cops brigading any comment that isn't explicitly procop or any they disagree with.    Yes it does.    She did actually. She did an interview with the New York Times.    You're mistaken if you took anything I've said as a defense of American law enforcement.    I don't think it's ever going to go away.    Kickbacks for RXs is illegal.   Yet it happens all of the time. Go [here] (https://openpaymentsdata.cms.gov/) and look up your doctor or some local doctors. My previous psychiatrist who works in a state funded mental health clinic has personally received around $25,000 from pharmaceutical companies.   You can hurl whatever personal insults at me that you like. I was simply pointing out this very cosy relationship between pharmaceutical companies and physicians. That's fine if you disagree. But don't suggest that I'm crazy or that this issue isn't worth talking about.    I wasn't agreeing with all of the statement, but I think people saw that I was agreeing that these men in the picture were fighting for their country, and I pointed out that not all German soldiers were Nazis, can you not see the difference in the two comments?  But yes, you just can't predict reddit logic sometimes!        Thanks for the link. Lots of useful stuff.    They are most commonly prescribed to people with mild to moderate depression. SSRIs are not effective for mild to moderate depression. What is so complicated about this?    Racial profiling isn't unique to American police.    The magnitude of benefit of antidepressant medication compared with placebo increases with severity of depression symptoms and may be minimal or nonexistent, on average, in patients with mild or moderate symptoms.   For the vast majority of patients ssris produce the same effect as a placebo.    Considering that they're most commonly prescribed for cases of mild/moderate depression, I would argue that it does.    Where the hell does it say that this sub is only for the misconduct of American police?    Does the [JAMA count?] (http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=185157)    Yes they actually can. They can receive all kinds of kickbacks and favors from drug companies and simply prescribing medications to all of their patients streamlines and maximizes the profitability their practices. A medicated patient is placated and must return to the office periodically to renew their prescriptions. A renewal is a fast and easy billable visit.   Edit: forgot two words.    Does that really matter though?    I didn't say that people didn't matter. I'm just saying that a business closing is nothing like a person dying. It's not even close. If the business closes the people who worked there are free to find employment elsewhere. A dead person cannot.   Businesses close all of the time. Most close because of causes that are completely out of the control of the organization's leaders. If a bakery refused to follow sanitation codes the health department would shut them down and it would be their fault. It wouldn't matter if they had a religious belief that washing their hands is wrong. If a business is operating on such unsustainable policies as refusing to provide the products and services that they deal in, why should it be a surprise when they have to shut their doors?    A business closing down is hardly the same as a person dying. Businesses close and are restructured all of the time. Most don't close as a result of a policy so stupid as refusing to provide the good or service they deal in. The individual(s)  with the* capital can choose to take* their money and knowledge and engage in other business efforts. A dead person can do none of* these things. The argument that businesses are people is as ridiculous as one can be. Businesses are comprised of people and those individuals already have the protections and rights of a human being. Businesses don't warrant some special status as human beings.   The cake situation, as ridiculous as it might be, is exactly what we're talking about here. That's the real world example.    How is that even close to comparable? It's not like it's an atrocity that a baker should have to bake a cake.                                                                                        A lot of people (myself included) are fed up with the way that sub is moderated. I'm looking for alternatives that don't arbitrarily prohibit subject material like police brutality/harassment. Thanks in advance for any input.  Edit: I should clarify that I'm looking for subreddits.                                                                                                                         Two New Yorkers are driving across the country. When they cross the Texas border the passenger looks at the driver and explains "Texas cops are supposed to be the worst and they really don't like New Yorkers. Let's try to obey all of the traffic laws so we can get through this state without any problems."  They hadn't made it very far when the driver notices a state trooper's cruiser appear behind them with lights ablazed. He quickly puts on his signal and pulls over. The trooper approaches the driver side window and the driver quickly lowers his window, only to find the officers baton smashing into his face.   "What the fuck was that for!?" the driver exclaims.   "I don't know how you city slickers do things in New York, but in my state you'll have your license and registration waiting for me when I approach your vehicle." the trooper barks at the driver. Frantically the driver retrieves the paperwork and hands it to the cop, who proceeds to write him a ticket. "Wait right there. " he spits while handing the ticket over to the driver.  He walks around the car and taps on the passenger side window with his baton. Nervously the man lowers his window. The officer quickly strikes him in the face.   "What the hell did I do!? He shouts as blood runs down his chin.    "Son, that's so when you get a few miles down the road, you won't be saying to your buddy [I wish that sonofabitch would've tried that shit on me.]."         The FCC requires this so that everyone is ensured [access to emergency services] ( http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/9-1-1#Problems_with_911). As long as you have a signal and an operating phone you're just three digits away from help.                           Reserve deputy Rick Walter was catching up on paperwork one night in the fall of 1992 when he was told to check out an abandoned car near Interstate 55.  He found a 1986 Buick Somerset at the top of an exit ramp about 1:30 a.m., just outside of this southeastern Missouri town that rises above the Mississippi River floodplain. Inside was the body of Angela Mischelle Lawless, a 19-year-old nursing student.  Lawless had been shot three times, once in the back of the head. But when Walter looked inside the car, he couldn't determine exactly how she had died.  "It was dark, and I didn't know if it was somebody just passed out," Walter said. "We opened the door and saw all the blood."  Fifteen years later, Walter, now the Scott County sheriff, sits in his windowless office and lets the Lawless case play out in his mind. There should be little reason to think about it now. Joshua Charles Kezer was convicted for the killing and sentenced to 60 years in prison. The case is closed.  But things just don't add up, Walter said.  Lawless clearly fought for her life against at least two attackers, Walter said, and yet, investigators identified and pursued only one suspect.  There were no witnesses to the killing. No physical evidence - DNA, fingerprints or murder weapon - linked Kezer to the scene. In fact, Kezer's friends and family say he wasn't even in the state the night Lawless was killed.  "People in the law enforcement community and regular people here have told me that they got the wrong guy in jail," Walter said.  So in early 2006, Walter did something almost unheard of in law enforcement: He reopened a murder case that was not only closed, but had already produced a conviction.  The sheriff and one of his detectives began reviewing hundreds of pages of investigative reports and witness statements. It would be a daunting task.  Witnesses were scattered. Fingerprints and blood can be reviewed and retested, but it was unclear what could be gleaned more than a decade later.  None of that mattered to the sheriff, a former construction worker who regularly wears a quarter-size pin that reads "My Son is a Marine." He already knew that if he ever got the chance, he would reopen the case.  "I wake up most mornings and wonder, 'Why am I sheriff?'" said Walter, who was elected in 2004. "I think this is why - to find the truth on this case."  FIRST TO THE SCENE  Everyone called her Mischelle. She was a cheerleader for the Kelly High School Hawks basketball team in Benton, and a farm girl at heart, having been active in the local FFA Organization.  In her younger years, she was a Girl Scout who volunteered as a candy-striper at area hospitals, so it was only natural that Lawless would pursue a nursing degree at Southeast Missouri State University.  "That's what she always wanted to do," her brother Jason said.  In many ways, Lawless was a bundle of contradictions. By her sophomore year in college, she was juggling boyfriends and partying a lot, friends said, yet she remained a regular at the Baptist Student Union.  Though she weighed just 95 pounds, Lawless wasn't afraid to stand up for herself.     I know this may be pretty well known, but it happened very nearby and has been complicated and painful for this area.   http://www.cbsnews.com/news/48-hours-probes-missouri-murder-mystery/  http://www.semissourian.com/story/1774443.html  http://www.semissourian.com/story/1791430.html  Edit: I forgot to add a summary.

 I think part of the issue is that memories aren't likely to depend on just a few synapses--robust memory formation probably involves a redundant set of strengthened circuits, distributed throughout the brain.   This is not actually new information for the brain.  It's new information for the hippocampus, but stable dendritic spines (synapses) have been documented n the cortex for many years now.  Holtmaat, A. J. et al. Transient and persistent dendritic spines in the neocortex in vivo.

You could get closer to the center of mass of the crumpled orange, so in that subset of cases wouldn't the gravitational pull of that orange be stronger? This is assuming OP meant the crumpled orange is collapsed inward, since the crumpled one is "more dense".  Also, I wonder how you get a hollow orange.

It might seem like you can't afford the time, but no one wants to wake up to the sound of their vehicle crashing . . .

It feels weird to relate to a main character who's kind of drifting along through a really bad time in his life, not even displaying a lot of angst about it.  Trying to phrase this to be non-spoilerish, but after the train incident and especially after he eats his first pasty, I started feeling more excited about where the plot was going . . . but it was still a gradual ramp-up.   I'm so excited to find someone else who has read it and enjoyed it!  I completely agree.  I read it for the first time in high school, and as I revisit it every few years, I find myself learning new things from it and relating to it in new ways as I gain real life experience.   When a sensory hair on the surface of the trap is bent, this stimulates stretch receptors--ion channels that open in response to a physical stimulus.  This allows positively charged calcium ions to flow into the receptor cells, and induces an action potential.  This is really similar to what happens in our own sensory neurons!  The ion influx changes the membrane potential of the cell locally, and this local change is propagated down the membrane throughout the cell as voltage-sensitive ion channels are stimulated by potential change.  This signal is then propagated to other cells in the lobes of the trap.  If I am reading the literature correctly, this happens in part through plasmodesmata, pores between cells that let ions flow through.  These pores can let the ion-induced voltage change continue across the borders between cells.  If two hairs are triggered within ~20 seconds of each other, the degree of the resulting signal is enough to induce a larger-scale change of ion distribution in the inner and outer surfaces of the lobes of the trap.  Either I can't find as detailed information about this part, or it is more poorly understood, but at least part of the mechanism of the trap closing relies on this ion distribution change, which causes the inner surfaces to shrink and the outer surfaces to swell, so that the lobes pop into a concave shape and snap shut.  http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2FBF00394867 http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v433/n7024/full/nature03185.html  Edit: TL/DR: The plant does (for all practical purposes) have a nervous system!

The Once and Future King by T. H. White: an epic, humorous, philosophical, moving re-telling of the best of the King Arthur legends.  Composed of four books that progress from an almost childrens'-book level coming of age story, to a fable-like contemplation of good and evil, to a dramatic character study of a deeply troubled hero, to a heart-breaking contemplation of morality and the struggle against the dark side of human nature.   Some things that we have hypotheses about, but no coherent, generally accepted explanation:  Why do we yawn? How is a memory physically encoded in the brain? Why is sleep so vitally important?    Most insects are considered prime examples of R strategists.  I say "most" to hedge my bets; I can't think of a K strategist insect right at this moment, but biology has a lot of quirks.   Reading scientific papers is really hard.  It's a true developed skill.  The best thing in the long run is for you to just have a try at it, treat it as a learning experience.  Try to relax and take it slowly.  Skim through the whole paper once, just trying to take in as much meaning as you can.  Underline words that confuse you and appear often, but don't worry about them yet, just try to get the gist of the whole paper.  Now read it through again, slowly.  Look up the words you underlined, and note their meanings in the margins.  This can and probably should take hours.  That's normal.  This will get easier.  Now read it a third time.  Look at your notes.  Think about the broader meaning of the paper again.  Now you can finally start to think critically about the paper's findings, what the authors did well or poorly.  Don't give up!  Your work WILL pay off eventually.  It just takes lots of practice, frustration, and interludes for kitten videos.

 I'm pretty used to the robotic voices because I often have to check websites for accessibility at work. I've never tried listening to a NoSleep story using Jaws or VoiceOver, though.   Congratulations, very well deserved.   Someone told me they were a fan. That totally made my day. But I have to say, pretty much any comment I receive makes me really happy.   Fantastic! I will definitely give it a read.   [The Worst Thing About Australia Is The Silence](http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/2sqe9k/the_worst_thing_about_australia_is_the_silence/)  There's just something about that title that gives me the creeps.   Theos god-awful, off-key, cat-strangling singing woke me up on the big day. I was spared the second half of his shower performance by leaving the dorm room to buy lukewarm coffee from the machine down the hall. Within the hour, we were out and headed to the airport in Theo's crapmobile. First class was balls to the walls awesome, even though Theo nearly got us thrown out for kicking the seat in front of us. It took a bit of his classic smooth talking, but we convinced the stewardess that Theo was suffering from terminal stage 5 Restless Leg Syndrome, and we got off the hook.   "Theodore Bishop and Markus Ryans?", called a smoking-hot babe, as we reached the luggage claim area.   Normally, Theo would have protested the use of his full name, but he was too busy gawking at the woman's plump red lips and tight body to notice. She congratulated us on winning the contest, and brought us to a limo waiting outside. An array of chocolate-covered strawberries and champagne waited on the back seat.   "Theo, you sure this aint a couples retreat?", I asked.   "Who cares? This shits free! Cmon. Lets have some champagne!", replied Theo, stuffing a bunch of strawberries down his gob.   The woman shut the passenger door, much to my disappointment, and headed to the drivers seat. I was hoping she'd join in on our celebration. Theo poured us  champagne, and we started drinking. Though I can typically hold my liquor, I started feeling kind of woozy after two glasses. It wasn't long before I passed out.   "Markus, shit. Wake up, man! I think we were drugged!", howled my buddy, giving me a firm open-hand slap to the face to stir me awake.   I groaned, grabbing my throbbing cheek. Theo looked as shitty as I was feeling. I had a huuuuuge hangover, the likes of which I had not felt since New Years '07. It took a moment for the reality to sink in, and for me to take in my surroundings. We were sitting in a patch of yellowing tall grass outside a run-down building covered in foliage. Its thick cement walls were grumbling apart, towering over us in an almost threatening manner. There was nothing but forest around us, and the sun was already setting. I couldn't find my phone or my luggage. I got up and spotted a massive faded sign that had fallen off the building. It read, in big bold letters: Grand Bay Hotel Miami. Under the name was something written in red spray paint, like graffiti: Grand re-opening!   Welcome back, bud! I miss the good times we used to share!  Write about how a haircut made you telekinetic?   CFU for LIFE, yo! I'd make us a logo, but I'm afraid it would look offensive.   First offouch.  Doesn't matter how it happened, though. I'm making you my honorary brother. We people-with-crooked-fingers have to stick together!   Green snakesRECYCLINGI see a pattern...   Thanks for the warm welcome! De-defending champion? *Gulp* N-no pressure, then?  Seriously, though. This is going to be fun. WUAHAHAHAHHAHAA. *Lightning strike*   Yay team! I've got a question for you, 'Capt. This is my first round of NoSleep Teams. I read the Wiki, but I'm still a *tiny* bit confused. How do we know when it's our turn..? (P.S. I am on your team, fearless leader!)   Are ya'll talking about the narrator that just kept doing fart noises the whole time?   I'm an early bird and always seem to get up at or around the same time every day regardless of how late I go to bed. Believe me, if I was physically capable of sleeping longer, I would.   I just got up because it's the weekend so I slept in. (8 am = sleeping in for this early bird)  I'm preparing my grocery list for the week. Exciting stuff.   I had nothing to do with his passing. It was a drunk driver.   Thanks for sharing. I'm both glad and sorry to hear that I'm not the only one dealing with these kind of issues. I'll try your advice, thank you.  As for your storymaybe you should write it. I found that writing this helped me come to terms with my condition. There's something cathartic about putting your thoughts on paper (or on a Word document, in this day and age).   Urgh, I can never reach you. Always right in the middle of my back.   I'm pretty average in all departments. Average height, brown hair, eyes that change color depending on the weather and/or what I wear, strong cheekbones, allegedly normal nose. (Though I sometimes use my face for reference when drawing stuff, and people keep telling me the nose looks weird.)  The only thing that's non-typical is my middle finger, which is kind of crooked at the top. I inherited that feature from my dad.   They booed me the whole time.   I would like to submit [I thanked the man who murdered my only friend]( http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/2sr06h/i_thanked_the_man_who_murdered_my_only_friend/) to the contest.  Thank you!   What if a third bump makes them even worse? I'm not sure I could deal with that...   Huh, I never thought of that. I have tried a few meditation techniques (without success). Maybe I should give them a taste of their own medicine.   This is going to sound like a farce, but ever since I suffered a concussion last summer, I've been hearing a live studio audience around me 24/7. The doctors reassured me they were merely auditory hallucinations brought on by the bump to my noggin, and that they'd eventually go away on their own once my brain healed. It was actually kind of funny at first. I mean, once I got over the initial shock and fear of hearing the unsolicited reactions of a bunch of strangers. They started off more entertaining than disturbing, but that balance eventually shifted, and I'm afraid of them now.   nbsp;  The very first time it happened was the day I was discharged from the hospital. It was a beautiful August day, and I was psyched to finally go out in the warm sun. Eric, my boyfriend, picked me up from the hospital to take me back to our apartment. I was in high spirits, despite a persistent headache, which had followed me since the bike accident. (Kids, wear your helmets!) Eric made a joke, and suddenly, a flurry of hysterical laugher came flooding in from every corner of the car. I screamed at Eric to turn off his surround sound system, covering my ears to drown out the noise, but the laugher only got louder. I could tell by the freaked-out look in Eric's eyes that he hadn't been playing a practical joke on me. Once the chuckles subsided, I explained what happened. Eric turned the car around and drove me straight back to the medical facility.   nbsp;  A brain scan, a few blood tests, and countless hours later, the doctors assured me it was a harmless side-effect of the concussion, and not a case of sudden onset schizophrenia, as I had feared. It was perfectly normal. Well, as normal as hearing a room full of easily-entertained spectators could be. They told me to go home and rest.   nbsp;  It took me a few days to adjust to the auditory hallucinations, but I eventually started to see the humor in my predicament. Meetings at work were a lot more entertaining, what with the peanut gallery projecting annoyed groans whenever my boss slipped into a boring tangent. I didn't even have to secretly roll my eyes: the voices in my head were the perfect vessel through which I could express my innermost feelings without getting in trouble. At home, my captive audience laughed at each of my jokes, even when Eric failed to react to the punch line. When I went to bed, they'd "awwww" as I wrapped my arms around Eric, and again when my cat curled up between us for warmth. The voices even became a sort of early-detection system, warning me of unseen dangers through a series of suspenseful gasps.   nbsp;  It started going downhill about two months ago, when I was taking a shower alone in my apartment. Eric was out of town that night, and I had this lingering fear that I'd forgotten to lock the front door. As I was pouring conditioner into the palm of my hand, I heard the studio audience gasp in fear. It startled me enough that I spilled the coconut-scented beauty product near my feet. My spectators continued to breathe in in a stressed manner that suggested I was about to get attacked by a psycho-murdering home invader. I could feel myself tensing up, as I stood there naked and unprotected. Thinking I heard footsteps, I took a step back, and slipped on the small puddle of conditioner. I remember feeling my feet flying towards the air while my upper-body swung towards the floor. With a sharp pain to the side of the head, everything went black. By the time I came to, the water was running cold. I called my dad, and he brought me to the hospital. I was rewarded with 9 stitches to the temple.   nbsp;  It's amazing what peer pressure can make you do, even when your peers don't actually exist. In a matter of weeks, my captive audience managed to completely disrupt my life. After the shower incident, it was as though they were no longer on my side. One morning, I was crossing the street when I heard them gasp. I stopped, thinking a car was heading my way. Fortunately, the street was empty. Unfortunately, my rapid stop caused me to slip on the ice and break my wrist. They laughed. Several days later, I had an important marketing presentation at work. The studio audience kept making disapproving noises, sometimes even booing me mid-presentation. It got me so tongue-tied that I messed up the whole sales pitch.   nbsp;  The worst was what they did to my relationship with Eric. Whenever we fought, they conveyed to me through "Urrrgh!"s and "Pffftt!"s that Eric was a complete scumbag. I'm not even sure what our last fight was about. I think it started with asking him to close the laundry room door. It was such an insignificant little fight, but made worse by the advice and reactions of a bunch of imaginary strangers. They made me doubt my feelings for him, until I finally cut him loose, much to their delight.   nbsp;  My relationships with my parents and friends devolved in a similar manner. It was shocking for me to hear what my subconscious mind actually thought about the people that had surrounded me all my life. After a few more incidents at work, my boss fired me. I was left without loved ones, friends, or a job. I felt so isolated, despite being accompanied at all times by the voices in my head. Alone in my living room, I drunk-dialed my ex, and he came over to cheer me up. We got back together that night, and it was wonderful.   nbsp;  Everything went back to normal after Eric and I rekindled our flame. I still heard the constant and distracting laugh track, but I tried my hardest to ignore them. I was happy again, and slowly but surely, I mended every bond I'd broken. I even got my old job back. Apparently, my boss couldn't handle the workload without me. Or so I've been told. For a while, all was right with the world, until one dreadful night.   nbsp;  I was half-asleep when I heard a knock at the door. I peeked through the window, only to find a squad car in the driveway. My heart stopped, and my faithful audience "OOoOOOOoO"ed. I opened the door, but of all the things those cops told me, all I remember hearing was this:   nbsp;  "I'm sorry 'mam, there's been an accident."   nbsp;  The studio audience roared with laugher and applause. Eric had died. My heart broke, but my spectators continued chuckling wildly. When Eric's casket was lowered into his grave, they laughed even harder. Tears streamed down the sides of my face, but they did not stop giggling and snickering the whole time.   nbsp;  I must be some kind of sick monster, because I can't keep them from laughing whenever I think of him. I just can't get them to stop.   Man, ya gotta enunciate. When you say that last line, really put emphasis on the "ip" of "ipsum", like so:  Lorem **IP**sum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.  Otherwise, it's not going to work.   You need to draw a pentagram in blood, place a screenshot of the author's submission page in the centre, chant the forbidden words, and bright forth the author to give you his OK.   And now I want to write about a dude afraid of kittens.   I liked it! Someone should try and stop her from driving. She could really hurt some people.  That right there. Haunting stuff.   I think the voice is good, but the sound quality is a little off. There's a lot of static.  OH DEAR GOD WHY IS THERE A SPIDER!?   Edit, now that I have recovered from the background image: Good pacing. Pacing is important. Your pacing is good. Spiders are not good. But the pacing is good. Yes. Good narration.   Oh, man. That sounds awesome...and horrific. I definitely want to read it when it's done.   Focus on the protagonists' reaction and thoughts about those fears. For instance, I've been working on a story where this dude has to grab something under a body bag. He has absolutely no reason to think something's going to happen to him, but he gets all nervous about it any ways. He ends up closing his eyes, and thinks he hears the bag crackling. He starts worrying that the corpse is alive, and that it's sitting up and looking at him, but he won't open his eyes to check. He later leaves the room, never knowing whether or not the corpse really moved. You can feel his terror without there being an actual, physical antagonist.   They're all yours!   The solution when you come across this kind of stuff is to tack "DUN DUN DUUUUUUN!" to the final sentence. Works every time.  Or does it? DUN DUN DUUUUUN!   Horror is like a box of chocolate: everything is delicious, except for the coffee-flavored truffles, because you wanted chocolate, damn it, not coffee.  There's no one good or bad recipe for horror, which is why I like the genre so much. As a writer, I get to dabble in different styles of horror without feeling like it's getting stagnant.  My advice to you is to start by writing about what scares *you* (unless you have a really weird phobia of, like, kittens or something). No matter what type of horror you write about, you'll find people who will enjoy it, so just go with what you're in the mood for.   Woah there, bucko. It's "Blood blood blood." Three bloods, and a period. That's a huuuuge distinction. The notebooks with "blood blood" are barely worth the paper they're written on.   Eh, it's a mix of virgin's blood and goat's blood, when I run out. And you ask why I have those? Why WOULDN'T I have them?   Do notebooks with the word "Blood blood blood." written about 500 times across its many pages count? Because I have, like, 20 of those in my the back of my car.  It would be kind of neat if we had a link in the sidebar to a page listing everyone's books (titles, urls, format). We could call it the NoSleep Library or NoSleep Bookshelf or something like that. Just a thought.   The selection committee ran out of tacos at the All-You-Can-Eat Taco Emporium and Crematorium. In their grief, they lost their joy de vivre and were unable to run the contest.* It's tragic, really.  *The following message may or may not be 100% accurate.   Thank you so much! If/when you write those posts, it will definitely help a lot of people out, myself included.   I'd really love to know how distribution rights work. Or, rather, what to look for and/or be weary of. I see you guys chiming about author rights when magazines call for submissions, and I have no idea what's reasonable and what isn't.  I'd also like to know your thoughts on self-publishing versus getting a publisherebooks versus physical copies, and how you'd go about it.  Another important thing I was wondering about, though this one probably doesn't have a concrete answer, is when do you know when you're ready to take that step? I absolutely love writing, and I have been extremely fortunate and lucky that some of my stories have appealed to people here, but I don't know if that means I can or should take it to the next level. Should unpublished writers just throw caution to the wind and go for it? Would it be best to try and submit for magazines and see if any of them bite so you have a -for lack of a better word- resum of published works?  Anything you share would be most helpful.  Thank you!    I actually plan on putting a few posts up here about my own experiences with self publishing because I just like helping out my homies.  That would be absolutely fantastic. Please do. I've been curious about the whole process.    I've been *Itch*ing to try this out. Count me in!   I wish I could, but I am physically incapable of smiling with these twitches forcing my lips downwards at all times.   .em truh ot gniog s'eh, em pleh esaelP   In your BOOK? I see what you did there, you sneaky punster, you!   GASP! I'll just have to douse myself in salt.   Edit: Wait, no. I'm not the one doing the ritual. What do I care about protecting myself against slug demons?   What if it's a slug demon?   Man, your parents will be ticked off when they wake up to go to the washroom and step on a bunch of salt.   If you were a carnival ride, which ride would you be and what would be your maximum capacity?   This is NoSleep. For all we know, the bobble heads will be decapitated.   http://nosleep.spreadshirt.com/ Shirts, tank tops, and totes.   Okay, who let Tortilla back into the wine cellar?   How the thinks anyone will believe he wrote that while he apparently cannot write a complete sentence is beyond me.   Dozens of missing posters cling to lampposts on the empty streets outside my home. Most hold photos of beloved family pets, but a few show the faces of children. They rustle in the wind, providing the only sound I can hear for miles, safe for the relentless tapping of the creatures feet against the sides of my house. I have not seen a soul in days. The monster has doubtlessly gotten them all by now. Perhaps there are still a few people left alive, naively praying for help to arrive. Those who wisely chose to hide in their basements could yet have survived, but nothing will stop it from reaching them, too. What happened here was my fault: I awoke the prehistoric menace. All I can do now is sit and wait for the end.   nbsp;   Ever since I was a boy, I have been fascinated with fossils. It began the day my parents took me to the lake for a fireworks display. While we were waiting for the show to begin, my mother told me that a man had recently stumbled across a large fossil on the shore. I am not sure whether she was trying to give a bored child something to do, or merely sharing a tidbit of information. Either way, I did what any kid would do in such a situation: I started hunting for a fossil of my own, dreaming of the fame and fortune it would bring me. I walked up and down the shoreline, eyes peeled for anything of interest, until I noticed a thin slab of black stone among the rocks. Something about it just screamed "fossil", and I excitedly turned it over. On its underside was a perfectly-preserved silvery ammonite, shimmering in the setting sunlight. The fossil was about an inch wide, and was accompanied by a few smaller specimens. I was positively beaming with pride when I showed it to my parents, boasting that I had made an incredible discovery, and that my long and fruitful career as an archaeologist had begun.   nbsp;  Over 20 years later, that fossil was still on display in my living room, even though my career as a palaeontologist did not pan out. (One of my teachers informed me that archaeologists do not, in fact, dig up dinosaurs.) Still, that fortuitous discovery in my childhood stuck with me through my entire life, and I never quite lost the compulsion to look for fossils wherever I went. As the years passed, I found other specimens: smaller ones, broken ones, but never one as striking as my very first. Not until last summer, that is.   nbsp;  It was a pleasant day: sunny and warm, but without the overwhelming humidity that usually weighed me down. Kids were playing in the streets, blue jays were battling squirrels for sunflower seeds in my feeder, and the sky was as clear as I had ever seen it. I decided to take advantage of the beautiful day by going for a stroll through the woods in my backyard. Following a beaten path, I navigated through the trees and to a quarry of stones beyond the woodland, where I sometimes searched for fossils. Up until then, I had not found any specimens there, but my luck was about to change. Extending from a mound of rocks, I spotted a polished burgundy stone. As I made my way towards it, I noticed a shape on its side. It was the most beautiful fossil my eyes had ever seen. About half a foot in diameter, the ammonite looked impeccable in every way. Its golden hue made it seem almost magical. I examined the snail-like relief, re-experiencing the genuine enthusiasm I had felt as a child.   nbsp;  I ran back to my place, my heart pounding with joy, and retrieved a wheelbarrow and towels to carry and protect the stone. After loading the boulder onto my makeshift carrier, I began pushing the heavy stone back home, sweat pouring down the sides of my face. I cleared some of the bushes in the garden outside my front door, and placed the stone carefully among my plants. For weeks, I showed it off to everyone that stopped by: neighbors, family members, even the pizza delivery boy. I felt giddy just looking at my amazing lawn decoration.   nbsp;  As obsessed with and proud of the fossil as I was, I am ashamed to admit it took me far too long to notice the change. At first, I thought it was just a trick of the light. It would seem a little bit bigger when I came home from work, but not so much so that it struck me as unusual. It was not until I returned from a two-week vacation that I truly realized the fossil was morphing. Though I counted five rings on its spiral when I left, I returned to find seven, and a sense of dread began to form in the back of my mind. Over the course of the following weeks, the creature became larger and larger. As more rings appeared and it grew from one foot to three, it became clear that the stone holding it could no longer contain the mass.   nbsp;  One morning, I stepped outside to find the red boulder shattered in half, and the spiral-shaped creature absent from its surface. All that was left was the scent of seaweed and salt emanating from the broken stone. My immediate reaction was that of relief. That is, until I saw the creature in the very foundation of my house. Still golden, still static, but several feet larger, the fossil had found a new home. It was around that time that missing posters started popping up, and that my birdfeeder ceased emptying. I should have seen the signs, but I was in denial. Besides, how could a fossilized creature come to life? I dug my head in the sand, convincing myself that it was just the work of a very talented guerrilla artist. I was a fool for not taking action: I should have destroyed it when I had the chance.   nbsp;  The metamorphosis accelerated after the creatures relocation. The snail-like shape grew larger, and began to uncoil, revealing thousands of tiny spiky legs protruding from its shell. The stench of an ocean breeze infected every corner of my house as the monstrous form grew to a meter in length. I was terrified beyond words, but powerless to stop the coming storm. No one believed me when I told them what was happening. Some laughed, others called me crazy. Every day, new missing posters got tacked to the areas mailboxes and lampposts, offering rewards that would never be claimed. Nothing could stop the monster from growing, until, one day, it ceased hiding within stone, leaving nothing but a crack in the concrete in its wake. I hoped it had moved on, but it was not long before I heard that Mrs. Carsons son had gone missing. He was the first of many children to mysteriously 'disappear'. I stopped leaving the house after that day.   nbsp;  A few nights ago, I finally ran out of food. Too afraid to abandon the safety of my home, I called for pizza. I thought it would be all right. I would never have done it if I had known what was about to happen. I watched as the delivery boy exited his car and walked up to my door. A dark shape scurried in the bushes outside. I knew it was the monster, so I frantically banged on the window, trying to warn the man. As he reached for the doorbell, the horrid beast launched itself towards him. Not wanting to see, I shut my eyes, but could still hear the ghastly CRUNCH as it engulfed him, leaving nothing behind. Sobbing profusely, I glanced out the window, and could clearly make out the armor-plated form of the horrid millipede-like creature in the cars headlights. It had grown to over ten meters in length. I shut the curtains in fear when it snapped its head towards me, as though insulted that I dared to look at it. The piercing sound of shredding metal echoed down the street as the creature ate the delivery boys car.   nbsp;  I can hear it skittering along the outside of my house now. It will not hurt me. Not yet, at least. It is saving me for later. This is its nest, and I am to be the food for the hundreds of young ones it spawned in the inner walls of my home. I have spent my whole life looking for fossils. Now that they surround me, I cannot help wishing I had taken up knitting instead.   Congratulations, ya'll!   Congratulations to the both of you! I look forward to catching up to date on the NoSleep podcast (I'm nearing the end of season 3) and hearing your stories. : )   But I so enjoy touching things. ;D   Happy anniversary, Mr. Butler! I love you beyond the scope of words, and my love for you is as eternal as the darkness of the night.   Unless /u/voodoovegetable is *actually* a serial killer and is only asking to cover his tracks...   New idea: a compilation book of all our stories, presented in a step-by-step interpretive dance guide format. It'll make the NY Times best sellers list in no time flat.   In her permission form, it just said that the intention was *not* to make money, but that should that change in the future, it would be divided equally between the writers, but that if a writer had more than one story, they would still get the same percentage.   When I gave my consent, I had no idea this was being done against the wishes of the moderators. I am definitely withdrawing it now.   Or species.   That wasn't chicken.   Ooooo, that would be awesome. And then you add in a feature where they  also warm up the house (in the winter) so that you can leave your bed and *not* freeze while getting dressed. Would it drive up the heating bill? Yes. Would it be worth it? ABSOLUTELY.   My sister got me an alarm clock for Christmas that imitates the sunrise. Over the course of half an hour, it lights up brighter and brighter until the alarm goes off. It's very pleasant, I would definitely recommend it.  The most important thing; however, is to keep electronics OUT of the bedroom. Lights and electronics can keep you from sleeping well and that, in turn, will keep you from waking up well.   It's okay. I read my income tax reports in David's voice.  Just a thought, Mr. Cummings: you could open a second Podcast called 'David Cummings reads your taxes." You'll make millions.   ...xD   That is so wonderfully poetic.   Huh, consider me impressed and newly-informed. I figured sites could pull your MAC address just like they do the rest of the information they keep track of.   Any comment that is positive is a comment that I like! Unless the comment is positive in the sense of a pregnancy test. I don't want my stories getting pregnant. They're too young to have babies.   I was wondering where you were going with that. And then I got to the end. And now, I applaud you.   David Cummings and Peter Lewis are definitely my two favorite male narrators. Jessica Prokuski is my favore female narrator. I'd say my LEAST favorite narrator is Demon Overlord 5000. His voice is just too...I don't know...raspy?     Geez, why are people giving you a hard time? o0; It's a legitimate topic of discussion.  I didn't watch a lot of horror movies growing up in order to protect my eardrums from my mom's high-pitch screams. Now that I'm older, I find that the problem with horror movies is that they rely too heavily on jump scares rather than actually trying to frighten you...so most movies do end up being Asylum-level bad. I remember watching The Cube and 13 Ghosts when I was in highschool. Both times, my friends were terrified and squeezing the blood out of my hands. Guess everyone's different. *Edit: Taming the typo demons.   I've played games where they could ban a specific computer's MAC address. The unruly player usually just jumped on their laptop and kept being a jerk.   My dad startled posting stories to NoSleep a couple months ago. One time, when he was visiting me, he posted before I had the chance to post mine, and I was locked out of posting for another 10 minutes.  I know it's too keep people from spamming, but c'mon. We weren't even using the same computer. This could have been prevented if Reddit had put the stopper on the MAC addresses instead.  So my guess would be around 10 minutes.   I was in the middle of talking to Sarah when you said that. Weird.   I just updated it.  	77

 Played for the first time:  **Panamax**: Really liked it, definitely in my top 5 for 2014. The rules explanation takes quite a while, but once we started playing everything is quite straight forward. It comes down to either (1) take a contract and load cargo; or (2) Move the ships. Players need to balance the pace well - shipping everything in a round might boost income and save costs, but it might be very difficult to avoid costs in the next round.  **City hall**: A worker placement + bidding game. Played this with 3 players. Was not impressed as I won by exploiting the health commissioned spot early on which seemed too powerful to me.  Games that I've played before: **Small World**, **Viticulture**, **Coloretto**   To expand on the games that you already enjoy: **One Night Ultimate Werewolf**, **Dead of Winter**   Games I've played for the first time:  **Hyperborea** - Really liked this! More of a engine/efficiency building game than a civ/4x. Bag building and action selection is very unique. Only complaint is on the similar colours of the cubes.  **Vitivulture** - Pretty standard light worker placement game about making wine. I would even consider this to be a gateway game. Heard that the expansion brings complexity so I'll give it a go if I have a chance.  **Vinhos** - Another game about making wine which is one of the heaviest economic games I played. I liked it a lot but felt that it was a bit unnecessarily complex - it's like 6 mini-games in one.   **Theseus** - Sci-fi mancala with different race abilities. Very tactical and plays within an hour. I'm surpriksed that I haven't hear many people mentioning this game before.   Games that I've played before:  **Hanabi**, **Quartermaster General**, **Fresco**, **Carcassonne**,   They are currently organising an Agricola tournament (with drafting rules of course) that starts in Jan 2015. Search for London on Board on meetup.com if you wish to sign up.   **Pictomania**, kind of like Pictionary but you have to draw and guess what others are drawing at the same time. Immensely fun to watch!   The sale for the previous days were amazing.... Betrayal at House on the Hill: 20 Small World : 20 Lords of Waterdeep: 15  But of course they were all gone in the matter of minutes if not seconds   EDIT: Dominion: 15, gone within seconds as well.   Great collection of Euros!  I dream of owning **Glory to Rome** and **Age of Empires III** too, both very solid games but they don't seem get enough attention here.   I have played the games you have listed except for Archipelago and The Pillars of the Earth.  It depends on i) whether you are looking for something new and ii) whether the "more players" you play with are comfortable with heavier games. I would recommend Castles of Mad King Ludwig as it is incorporates bidding (sort of), tile laying, and building your own castle, which is sort of a blend of the games you enjoy.  Note that:  Concordia - without the expansion, this is a 3+ player game.  Manhattan Project, Bruges, Euphoria - These are all solid games for 4 players but I'm not sure how well they go with 2 players.   I've played 4 games with the expansion and feel that the new races make the game much more interactive and competitive/aggressive.   Volcano factions can splurge easily in the first round if they wish and Shapeshifters and Riverwalkers could "intrude" into your home terrain. In a 4-5 player game, if you are not careful around these factions you could get locked in quite easily.   4 players. As with other Feld games I think it would play well in 2p and 3p scenarios as well. After rules explanation, we finished in under 2 hours and didn't have to revert to the rulebook so the rules were quite straightforward. Minor complaint would be that there is an icon on the board that was printed really small (it doesn't help that the board is extremely colourful). Also requires a bit of time for initial setup.   My friend bought it at Essen for 35. Boardgameguru now has it at 40.   Great week for me:  **Terra Mystica (with Fire and Ice expansion) x2** - played the Shapeshifters (1st in a 4p game) and the Riverwalkers (2nd in a 5p game). Loved it. I feel that the expansion makes the game more interactive and you really have to keep an eye on what other players are capable of doing.  **Aquasphere** - Loved it too! I'm pleasantly surprised that a simple programming/action mechanic created such an interesting game. The length felt just right, and the production quality is superb. Thinking of buying a copy.  **La Isla** - Underwhelmed by this new Feld game. Minimal interaction, theme is bland. Upside is the short setup and play time.  **Bora Bora** - Lots of interesting choices throughout the game. However I find that the dice rolls can screw one over even more so than CoB.  **Steam Donkey** - Pretty decent filler for its price and length. Easy to teach as well.     I would guess costs such as rent and payroll take a big part in this. In order to compete effectively with online stores, it is true that FLGS should be offering an experience (e.g. game nights/ staff recommendations) rather than just sales so that people are willing to pay a little bit extra to support it.   Short but fruitful week of gaming.  Games I've played for the first time:  **Le Havre**: Absolutely loved it. I was scared to take a loan (fear of not feeding developed from other games) and ended up with 167 points but next time I'll definitely go for loans. I think I prefer it over Agricola because everything is open information (except for special buildings but there's a way to take a peek). Only downside is that it's 3 hours.  **Dungeon Lords**: I had high expectations for the game but I just found it too unforgiving and chaotic. Hope to try Dungeon Petz some time.  **Pictomania**: I was truly pleasantly surprised. I'm not much of a party game player but this was so fun to come up with a clever way to draw/complain at the obscure drawings from other players etc. I hadn't laughed so much during a game for quite a while.  **King of Siam**: Neat little area influence game. Pretty good for its weight and length (each player only gets 8 actions during the game).  Games I've played before: **Lewis   Clark**, **Russian Railroads**, **Greed**, **For Sale**, **Splendor**    I'm one of the lucky ones I would say. I live in London and had joined the board game meet up group that meets practically every single day.  If I show up on both days in the weekend I am guaranteed to enjoy 18 hours of gaming per week already.   Pretty good week.  Games I played for the first time:  **Sons of Anarchy**: It's pretty good for a light thematic game. There's a bit of dice rolling though so we didn't take the game too seriously  **Santiago de Cuba**: Good fun for its weight and length. Maybe too much of screwing people over though.  **Navegador**: The roundel idea is neat but I have doubt over its replayability. I would still prefer Concordia.  **Dead of Winter**: I'm usually not a big fan of co-op/semi co-op but this was probably the best one I've played. We were certain we would fail but we did pull it through (finished main objective) by strategically attracting zombies to different places. Completely forgotten about my second objective at the end though so I didn't win...  **Taj Mahal**: mildly interesting but it feels unsatisfying as a bidding game.   **Around the world in 80 days**: Slightly fun racing game with a card drafting element. Not much depth to it, probably playing once is enough.  Games I've played before: **Istanbul**, **Sail to India**, **Greed**     	17

 I was raised to be a trekkie. My first crush was on Spock. My father thought me the "live long and prosper" hand gesture when I was at most 5 (that's as far back as I can remember knowing it). I watched all the shows on TV for years, but only recently finished watching them entirely, thanks to Netflix.   Picard and Janeway are very close to my heart, along with all the other captains, but Janeway will always be my number one role model. She manages to be super badass while retaining her femininity. And her hometown is the same as mine (Btown forever!).   Used unpopular opinion puffin for a reason.      This afghan has gotten big enough that I think it will stay home. And the constant work has made my wrists hurt, and I can still get a good 8 hours of work done outside of the 4 hours I have class.   Hello all!  I am working on my first afghan ever, which I hope to give to my grandmother for her 92nd birthday on 3/15. I started it on Saturday, and am already making a lot of progress. However, I still think that I'll need to spend every free moment to work on it to get it done in time.   I brought it to class with me today, because I've got about an hour in between some classes, but it is already so big that it takes up so much space in my backpack.  How do y'all deal with traveling with a huge project? Is there a magical folding technique I could use? If not, do y'all have any tips for bringing a project with you to places?  Tl;dr: how can I bring the afghan I'm working on with me without taking up a lot of space in my backpack?   Also, should I make sure to get a non-declawed cat to match my current non-mutilated one? I dont want any injuries.   Hello, another question. I trust Reddit on cat information.  I'm planning on adopting a new cat this Friday, because my 10.5-month old needs a friend. I'm planning on getting someone a little older than her. Do I need to make sure to get separate food for him? My current kitty is pretty much done growing at this point, and has started eating less (I fill her bowl up twice a day and she hasn't finished it in 30 minutes anymore), so I was wondering if I could start the switch to adult food yet. Or, could I feed a 12-15 month old kitten food for a couple months? I can afford getting separate food, but it would be nice if I could use the same.  Tl;dr: getting a new cat, hopefully not a kitten. Could I use the same food with my 10.5-month-old as a more adult cat? Either switch the current one to adult food or give the newbie kitten food.   This. I usually just spray it on my hairbrush and pass it through a few times, especially on the underside.   Collinsites forever!   But seriously, if all LLCs have the same level of community as Collins, then I highly suggest it.   The store close to me has them for less than $6, so I do when I'm broke or don't feel like walking to the liquor store.      And I always put on Frank Sinatra.    I had a friend with epilepsy (or some other seizure thing) and remember the first time he had one in front of me. I'll tell you, it isn't pretty, although you can probably imagine that. We were out for a smoke and all of a sudden he looked out to nowhere and next thing I knew, he was on the ground seizing. My lifeguard skills kicked in, so I got him to the safety position and got someone to call for an ambulance, cuz it was his second that day. It was so scary, he didn't know what year it was, who the president was, anything. You're description helped me realize just how out of it you get.   I've heard that the bitter apple stuff or whatever doesn't always work. That's why I went for the polish first.   So, I posted a question a couple weeks ago regarding computer cords and that foul tasting nail polish designed to help you quit biting your nails.   I've been putting a coat on a couple times a week and my cat hasn't chewed on my charger at all. I saw her try when I first did it, and she was licking her lips and I could tell that she had an unpleasant taste in her mouth.  Hope this is useful to anyone else. It's been a great solution for me.  Tl;dr: if your cat chews on your charger cords, coat the cords with Bite-It and it will help.   This may be better suited for the general discussions thread, but this stupid cold has got me thinking.  Does anyone else have old long sleeve shirts that are way too small to wear on their own, but make the best cold weather undershirts? I've got a black one from my goth phase (7-8th grade) that I've had on under my sweaters all week. Like, I know the shirt itself looks silly, but layers are awesome.   We had to put my family dog down 5+years ago, and this brought a tear to my eye. If I weren't broke, I'd give you gold.   That's literally the only way I can get the motivation to clean. I go full-on 40's/50's housewife.   Thanks! My sister says the clips were a free add-on when she ordered the brushes, and I don't eat chips, so I figured I'd put them to good work.      Less thought out than the earlier comment, but I'll give my two cents.  When I want to make a pattern, I just make a second of the same project. I write down what I remember doing for the first time, with plenty of room for notes. As I work up the new version, I change the blueprint as needed.  That said, I've only written three or four patterns before, and it was mainly to keep track of things when I was making big projects.   All drugstore products, and I'm sorry I'm smiling so creepily in the photo.      http://www.imgur.com/U1OM5EU.jpeg Sitting around my apartment being cold. I got out from underneath my blankets for the first time to take this. Wool leggings from REI, neon t-shirt from Michael's, homemade black cowl.   I don't have the money right now for a new one, I'm probably going to put a little away until Spring Break.   Should I put my current cat's litter box near the door? The only viable option in my apartment for that would be to have the litter box in my bedroom, in front of the bathroom door, and I would almost certainly step in it.  If I put two hanging toys on either side of the doorknob, would that help socialize them when I'm in class?  I plan on going to the shelter fairly often to play with the available cats, and see which ones have similar personalities. I just think someone with almost as much energy would chill her out so much, because she's always running around and trying to play with everything.   Haha, when I brought my Katie home for Thanksgiving, we heard her meowing for almost an hour and didn't see her, which is unusual. Turns out she was in the cupboard with the trash can, and she didn't seem phased at all.   I've searched, so I know the basics of bringing a new cat home, but my situation leaves me with some questions.  Katie is a 10-month-old barn cat. She's been with me and strictly indoor since she was 12 weeks old, but she is sassy and spastic as hell. We've had playdates with other people's cats, and she has always terrorized them, even though she's tiny. My best friend's 13 pound Mane Coon hides whenever they've been together.   Is she too much of a terrorist to adapt to another cat?  Also, my apartment only has one inside door, in the bathroom, and my bathroom is tiny. To keep them separate for a bit, would keeping the newbie in the bathroom be ok?  Katie lived with two rabbits for a couple months, and got along great with them, but I'm definitely not getting a rabbit (I lost so many cords in my 2.5 months of living with rabbits).  She is seriously tiny. She's maybe 7 pounds, was the runt of her litter, and hasn't gotten any bigger for a few months.  EDIT: I'd go to shelter and see what's available, but I think getting a fixed male between 8 months and 1.5 years old would be best. I think she'd get along better with a rambunctious friend who's bigger than her.  Tl;dr: I think my cat could use a friend, but she's always terrorizing any other cat she's met. My apartment is small. Could I get another cat and keep him in my bathroom?   Background: I am a political science major, and have wanted to work in the public sector for as long as I can remember. I believe that the point of government is to promote the common good, and the fact that the founding fathers chose these words to be the first to appear in our constitution represents that belief to me.      If it makes you feel any better, even the skinny members of my family get diabetes.   That's a great idea! I have a spare toothbrush, anyway.   Great! Maybe I can save my oil, then.   Ive had incredible luck when it comes to acne/clogged pores. I wash my face every time I shower and have never had a serious breakout.  I'll prolly just use my vegetable oil, because most of the benefits of coconut oil I already have: my hair grows too fast; I use henna to dye my hair, which conditions; I don't scar too bad.   I've searched both here and /r/MakeupAddiction, and couldn't find an answer to this specifically.  I've seen a lot of posts saying sugar+olive oil is a good lip exfoliant, but I usually don't keep olive oil in my house (my family has a history of low cholesterol, so I use butter for everything). Would sugar+vegetable oil do the same thing? I've got vegetable oil for in case I decide to make a cake from a mix.  Tl;dr: does sugar+vegetable oil exfoliate lips as much as sugar+olive oil?   I'm planning on getting a nude lip liner when I go grocery shopping next, because mine ran out. For every day, I'd be more careful and use a brush, I was just excited to swatch these.      One of my best friends has worked at a pet store for 1.5 years, so I definitely asked her. Like I said before, I'm going to try the Bite-It, and if that doesn't work, I'll go with something citrus.    Katie may be teething right now, I've read it happens several times in the first year and she's been chewing on everything much more in the last month or so (even the corner of the bag of kitten food), so hopefully it will pass. But I've got several options now.   Yeah, my problem is that she pretty much only chews when I'm not watching, which makes me think that she knows not to do it.   I'm trying the Bite-It for now, but I've got lemon spray too, if I find her chewing. She tried earlier and was then licking her lips to get the taste off, and I'm guessing the tiny bit she might get from that won't be too bad for her.   Thanks!  I'm worried, because I've heard several stories about bitter apple not working, and my baby chews on or licks pretty much everything.  Would lemon wood polish spray work?  I'm going to ask the guys at the tech store when I get my new charger.   I asked a similar question on a thread in /r/cats, but you ladies (and gents) might know, too.  My 10-month old kitten chews on my MacBook charger and ruins it. I'm going to buy my third in a month, and at $80 a pop, it's getting expensive. She only does it when I'm not looking, which makes me think she already knows not to do it.  Can you coat a charger with that foul tasting nail polish designed to help you quit biting your nails? I think that would deter her, but I'm not sure if it's safe for the charger or the cat. I know not to use anything spicy, but no-bite is just chemicals that taste horrid (I've used it, and the spicy kind, which just made me want to suck on my fingers more because I love spicy food). If not, I can get some bitter apple stuff, as /r/cats suggested, but it's a long hike followed by a long bus ride to get to a pet store here. Maybe Kroger would have some in the pet department.  Tl;dr: cat chews on power cord. Can I coat my new charger in no-bite to keep her from ruining another?   I know this is an old post, but do you think coating the cord in that foul tasting nail polish designed to help you quit biting your nails? Would that damage the cord? I'm about to buy my third MacBook charger in a month, just because I take away any short strings so my baby won't choke.  EDIT: I think she knows not to do it, because I never see her chewing, but when I come back inside after a smoke, the cord is ruined.   I've been crocheting for about 10 years now. My mother taught me the basics, and I just figured the rest out for myself. About 4 years ago I finally realized that what I had been calling single crochet was actually a slip stitch, and my double crochet was actually single.   I've tried following patterns for things in the past, and the things always end up too big or just strange. I can kind of read them (at least, I understand the whole "ch4, slst into first, ch1 and dc into next st, repeat 4 times" thing, but nothing ever works right.  That being said, I have successfully made hats, socks, scarves, and even a dress with my limited knowledge. If I want a fancy stitch, I can look up the stitch itself and then incorporate it into whatever I'm making. Patterns can be nice for a basis (I needed on to figure out heels the first time I made socks), but I find it much easier to just do my own thing. Increase, decrease as you need to, but once you know sc, dc, inc, and dec, you can make anything. Anything that requires a close fit, just make sure to fit check every couple of rows (when I made socks for the first time, I slipped them on even more often) and don't be afraid to undo a lot of work if something didn't go well (I also had to redo the toes on my first pair of socks ~6 times).  Idk the point of this post, really, but I searched for something similar, and nothing really came up.  TL;DR: you don't have to be able to read patterns to make things, you just need to be willing to do fit checks super often, and to pull things out if you realize what you're doing is wrong.   I've made several. First, measure from your waist to however long you want your skirt to be. Then, measure around your waist and every couple of inches going down the length. Divide each of these numbers in four. Cut two kinda funky rectangles that are as long as you want and as wide as you need at each point you measured. I usually put dots at each measurement point, then connect them. Using the same measurements, cut the front on the fold so it will fall flat. Sew all the rectangles together, put a zipper in the back, hem, and voila!  This is how I always make them, although having a waistband could be nice, too. There are better tutorials with picture online.   Munster is around 4.5 hours from me, but I've got some friends from the region, so I'll ask them if they'd be down for a trip. Quite a few Three Floyd's brews are available near me, so at least I've got that going for me.   I'll be on the lookout for all of these. Since I can get Harpoon cider, I'll bet I can find others. Thank you!  Edit: my Kroger had Harpoon ipa, and it's pretty good. And def good for a beginner's ipa   I'm in southern Indiana.  Edit: but my health food store has a huge selection, but a large portion of it is international.    Hello all!   I decided for my new year's resolution that I would become more of a beer connoisseur. Both my local grocery store and my local health food store have really excellent build-your-own six pack selections, so I've been picking up one or two of those a week.  To be honest, I prefer a good cider to just about anything (Harpoon Craft Cider is my favorite thing ever), but I also like a good beer. However, most of the selection at Kroger is ipa's and apa's. I'm really not a fan of pale ales, or really anything that is super hoppy, but I'd like to build a taste for it.  Wheat beers are probably my favorite, and Upland Wheat Ale is one of my favorite beers, although that might just be because it's widely available where I live. Of the mix-a-sixes I've made, my favorites were Baltika #4   9, Two Brothers Ebel's Weiss, and Boulevard Unfiltered Wheat beer.  What are your recommendations to start my journey away from dark lagers and wheat ales?  To;Dr: I would like to expand my beer horizons, especially when it comes to pale ales and strong hoppy flavors. What do you recommend?  EDIT: the mix-a-six at my Kroger today had both Founder's all day ipa (which wasn't the best) and Harpoon ipa (which is pretty good). Thanks for the suggestions, y'all! I hope the health food store is open the next time I want a mix-a-six, because I know their selection is better.  EDIT 2: I also got some gumballhead, which is a good beer for those in my situation, who love wheat beer and want to learn to like hoppy beers. It's a good middle ground.   Yeah, my hometown's population is less than 4k. And a lot of my friends are from even smaller towns.   I've come to the realization that I am a boring individual. I have no hobbies, I don't branch out, and I'm sad most of the time.  I go to class, then I sit and watch Netflix and get drunk until I go to bed. Due to injuries, there are very few physical activities I can do without immense pain, and the only other things I do for fun (crochet, baking) are entirely solo.  I've been dating around, looking for someone I have anything in common with, and simply haven't been able to. I thought it was because I hadn't found anyone I'm really interested in, but that's not it. It's because I have nothing to have in common with someone.  TL; DR: I'm boring, and I don't know how to change it.  EDIT: Thank you all for your comments. Unfortunately, I just started Christmas break, but you all have helped me think that maybe I should just go do things.   Hello all!  I've been invited to a holiday party for the office where I worked for a year. I quit in August, because I was too busy to continue working there, but I still think I should make an appearance, because I loved the job and it gave me so many connections.  As background, the office was on my college campus, and focuses on educating the public about Congress. My boss was a former Congressman. The party is for every faculty and staff member in the department, which include my former Congressman boss and a former Senator from my state.  While I've been told by several people that faculty parties are generally not super fancy, I believe that this one is a bit different. In the year I worked there, I never saw a man out of a suit and woman in anything other than business. My office was business casual, but I was usually the least well-dressed person there, even in pencil skirts and cardigans.   I recently slipped on the ice and dislocated my knee, and am finally off crutches, but I don't think that I can handle anything other than sneakers or snow boots. However, I think I'd be able to switch into nicer shoes for the small amount of time I'll be there, and I've also got a pair of nice black, flat oxfords that would be acceptable. It is from 3:30-5:30, but I'll have to leave by 4:30 to get to a final.  I have a few ideas as to what to wear. I've got a deep purple velvet dress, which I usually put with mustard tights and brown heels, as well as a huge number of different colored pencil skirts, which I'd pair with a nice white button-down. Any advice you could give me would be very much appreciated. I'm broke, so I can't buy anything new, but I have a few things fancier than what I usually wore to the office.  TL;DR: Holiday party tomorrow from 3:30-5:30pm, for faculty and staff of a school in which I worked in an office for a year. I would assume business casual to semi-formal, except to attendees will be a former Congressman and a former Senator. HALP!   I made my dresses both years, so they are just sitting in closets at home. Since they were made to fit me perfectly, I didn't even think about donating them. Junior year, I didn't even get it finished, and had to sew it closed onto my body.   Lost mine, but omg it was the cutest lighter ever.      This post: http://www.reddit.com/r/trees/comments/1ru7q4/can_we_stop/  I hardly go on /r/trees anymore, because it's so filled with boys (not men) and posts that just don't interest me much, but this post came up on my front page yesterday, and it got me thinking. I've pretty much only had dates recently from dating sites, because I'm too awkward to actually ask people out in person (unless I'm high, and I don't like being high in public). My profile talks about Mary Jane, because it's a big deal in my life, and I usually only respond to people who also talk about it, or at least have answered questions by saying that they smoke.   Do you ladies look for men who smoke? I often do, like I said, but that is far from enough to make me want to be with them as anything but smoking buddies. Also, have you ever experienced being "put on a pedestal?" I have some female friends who talk a lot about how they get to smoke for free most of the time, and that they have joined a group of men smoking a bowl, just because they wanted company (this was mainly true when all my friends and I lived in a dorm and we had a smoking area for cigarettes that most of us used to smoke weed), and have been passed the bowl without asking and after having said that they were just out of a cigarette or company and weren't trying to be smoked out.  TL;DR: Do you specifically look for men who smoke when trying to find someone to date? Have you ever experienced being "put on a pedestal" for being an girl who smokes?   Thanks! It wasn't due after break, I just worked a lot on it. It's for an incomplete I got last fall, and I have until the end of the semester to submit it. I'll say that it'll be pretty dense, but if you're willing to proof a comparative analysis of worldwide campaign finance, I would appreciate it!  EDIT: The piece is named Godric, for obvious (to me) reasons. I usually smoke rolled things, but I ran out of papes and this bowl holds about the same amount as the spliffs I roll.   While it doesn't look as good as it could, it tastes amazing and buttery and eggy, as brioche should. If anyone's wondering, the recipe is from "The Roux Brothers on Patisserie." A lot of the other recipes aren't great, and with this one I still add a bit of nutmeg and a tiny bit more sugar, but I love the book simply for the amazing food porn.   Thanks. I wish I had a baking sheet big enough to not have to shape the braid into a circle, but it still tastes amazing.   It's the tiniest bit overdone, but not burned at all. My recipe calls for double eggwash, and this was my first time making a double batch. Not the prettiest, but still tastes amazing, as brioche should.      I've been dying my hair with henna for seven years now. It is permanent, and conditions your hair/makes it shiny. I do it myself and buy the powder in bulk at the health food store, so idk about doing it at a salon. Just make sure you use pure henna and do a strand test. Some heavy metals in some brands react really badly with dyed hair. Like, melt your hair off bad.      My cold sad outfit is wool leggings, wool socks, and a baseball-style top I cut to be off the shoulder from the golf team from my sophomore year of high school.  Warm sad/hungover days are Paris boxers and some random tank top.  When I want to go out and feel really sexy, I have this royal blue pencil skirt that my friends and I call "the skirt," because I have literally never worn it and not been hit on hard.   Not exactly what you're asking, but I usually layer a few pairs of tights for warmth and opacity.   Everyone in my family asks for my chocolate chip cookie recipe. Making grandma-level cookies at 21 is one of the things I love bragging about.   is just a big ol' mess of nut drunk not drunk not drunk not drunk not drunk HOLY SHIT NOW I'M REALLY FUCKING DRUNK.  EDIT: Omg, I love not having class after noon of Mondays and Wednesdays.   Thank you!   Thank you! While I don't have any experience with retail, I have been called the Queen of Organization, and I at least think I know my stuff.   Thanks! Like I said, I dropped my resume off in July, right after they had done a bunch of hiring. They only called me back last week.   Thank you! I think I know my stuff, I've been going to this same shop for three years now, and sometimes get frustrated when the workers can't find something simple.   I agree so much, I hate more than anything when the head shop people can't find a simple brand of papes when it's right there. Last year the shop had an influx of hot, brainless female employees, recently they've been better. I don't think I'll fall into that.   Hello all! I usually just lurk and comment 'round these parts, but I have a question that I think you ladies will be able to answer better than /r/femalefashionadvice , even though this is usually their territory.  As the title says, I have a job interview at my head shop tomorrow morning, and I am at a complete loss as to what to wear. I know for regular interviews you want business casual, or at least nicer clothes. But the head shop is so different from every other employer I've had, and I want to work there so so badly. The people working are pretty strictly jeans and t-shirt, but I want to make an impression that doesn't scream "she's trying too hard." Even though they dress so casually, I'm still thinking nicer pants (because all my jeans are torn up/worn out) or a casual skirt + tights (because it'll be below freezing when I need to be there) and a t-shirt (probably a Slytherin one I have because it's my absolute favorite and I feel so wonderful in it), but I'm not sure if even that's too casual.  Thank you in advance, I know you ladies know how to help another entwife in need.  EDIT: I'm also meeting the owner (whom I've never met, even though the employees know me by name and know exactly what type of papes I want), and the interview is at 8:30am (not at all hard for me to be awake for).  tl;dr: I've got an interview at my local head shop tomorrow and I have no idea what to wear. HALP! Please.  EDIT 2: Thank you so much for the help, everyone. I had the interview this morning, ended up in the black pencil skirt + black tights + Slytherin t-shirt, and I think it went really well. If anything, I showed how punctual I am, because I was there 5 minutes before the interviewer.   Commenting to save this pattern. I usually hate amigurumis for some reason (possibly because I already own way too many stuffed animals for a 21-year-old), but this hits right in the childhood.   I have a beautiful coral eyeshadow that is sadly not very pigmented. However, it's perfect for dabbing on over concealer, under foundation. Kinda cancels out the purple blue (mine are a little green cause I'm really warm toned).   Hopefully you'll find a coat with long enough sleeves! I'm just here to say that long wrist warmers under mittens are wonderful for that awkward uncovered wrist.   My birthday is on the 28th, and my best friend's is Nov. 2. Birthday Halloweek has been a thing for us. This year we're 21, so it's basically just an excuse to dress up, get wasted, and eat our body weights in chocolate all week without any judgement.   Slutty Teddy Roosevelt. Don't have an SO, which is ok, because I don't think anyone will be able to outdo Slutty Teddy Roosevelt.  Part of the reason that's my costume is simply because I believe that the words "Slutty Teddy Roosevelt" should be said together as many times as possible.   Rimmel Lasting Finish lipstick in Pink Blush. I describe it as my baby prostitute lipstick, cuz that's what I feel like when I put it on. I always try it again every few months, and it's always just awful.  I generally feel like a baby prostitute if I try any pink lipstick, though. I'm sticking to red or bare from now on.   I really only have one pair of sneakers that I can wear. Since I'll have to walk to the venue and have really bad knees, cute shoes are pretty much never an option, sadly.   I'm going on a second date with a guy I really like tomorrow. We're going to a comedy show at night. What do I wear?  For background, I wore a white skirt, grey tights, a grey sweater, and a pink scarf for our first (coffee turned into early dinner) date, and am thinking pants for this one because it will be cold. I've got most of the basics, and I absolutely love cardigans. Would skinny jeans+cute printed t-shirt+cardigan be too casual?   I've gone through two pairs of 5fingers and I love them so much. I had a grey/bright blue pair that I wore nearly every day for three summers, and a grey/strange army-ish green pair that is nearing the end.   I'm generally less concerned with how my feet look because (due to years joint damage) if I do, my knees/hips/back hurt badly enough to not get out of bed for a few days afterwards. However, I just treated my vibrams like any other shoe. The green pair works really well with all the earth tones I wear, and I think all black Mary Jane-style ones are some of the cutest things ever. They really don't look much different from other black shoes, and if someone is seriously disturbed by them, they need to figure out why feet are so "gross."   (Partially to deal with the oh-so tacky see-through leggings) I always wear two pairs of leggings, which usually makes them much warmer!   I'm not a vegetarian, but I often cook big dinners with my friends, many of whom are.  My favorite non-meat protein sources are edamame (green soybeans) and the combination of peas and pasta (together they make a complete protein.) Edamame is great because you can put some frozen beans in tupperware and they'll be thawed and the perfect temperature by lunch.   Don't worry /u/vickivoracious I wasn't offended.   Actually it's glass. Hooray for shower ledges!   Girls are, in fact, on the internet.   I made it a little too strong, and I love the triple bitterness.   I wanted a picture of it, but didn't want to risk getting my phone wet. Be assured, it was drunk in the shower.   It takes the refreshing part of showers added to the refreshing part of drinks.   Shower Gin and Tonic is even more refreshing!   You got it!   The gin was brown. Would have preferred the clear kind, but lack of funds means you gotta go with plastic bottle Seagrams.      "A rebellion is always legal in the first person, such as 'our rebellion.' It is only in the third person -- 'their rebellion' -- that it becomes illegal." -Ben Franklin in 1776   I love taking a long hot shower during the comedown of LSD and MDMA.   I'm a little afraid to try it in my new apartment because the water doesn't get very hot and sometimes I'm a little bitch when it comes to lukewarm showers.   I'm going as slutty Teddy Roosevelt. Because.   saving and commenting for number 4   Maybe it was just me, but when I was getting drug tested I got pee on my hands every time, and it was my own pee. So getting some on your hands won't be an issue. Just say you aren't used to trying to aim.   That's what I'm reading!   Mixing another drink every time you need a break from Plato is a great way to get wasted on a weeknight.   Perfectly describes me. Also, I mainly go on dates with guys who smoke anyway, so it works out. All ents smoke before going out to eat. I usually have a spliff rolled up for when we meet, then we'll walk to wherever we're going.   And what about difficult last names? Mine only has two syllables, but I get people assuming it's one all the time.   If the password for "Sit on my face" isn't "and tell me that you love me," I would be very upset.   My ex boyfriend not only continued to use my parents' account after we broke up, but (at least I'm pretty sure) then changed the password himself so none of us could. Luckily, we were able to completely reset the account after my dad couldn't sign on one day.  He also didn't sign out of my friend's account on his Xbox until he invited her over and she saw him using it.  You don't even want to know how insane this boy is.   Down in btown we've been getting medicinal from Michigan and Cali (believe it or not) for a while now. No one I know has any idea where to even try to find mids.   IU ent (born and raised just outside Bloomington) here, the college towns are oases of intelligence in a bass-ackwards sea of methed out ignorance.   I don't forsee a democratic governor in my lifetime. Moving the hell out of this state as soon as humanly possible.   I've never understood how calling me independent is supposed to be an insult.   1) seriously, go to class.  2) take anything and everything that seems interesting, at least at first, to find something you're really passionate about. I'm a junior picking up Arabic because I like languages.  3) read for class and do your homework.   4) learn to take good notes. This means (at least for me) outline style, with the main points copied from the PowerPoint and subheadings from discussion.  5) no matter how dumb you think you might sound, speak up in class. This is especially important in language classes, because it allows your professor to help you with pronunciation and grammar.  6) eat dinner at Collins. Or just go to Collins as often as possible. But I'm biased on that front (lived there for two years).  7) take a class with Aurelian Craiutu. Seriously, this guy is the best there is. He's Political Science, but teaches other classes, too. He will challenge you and won't accept bullshit. I took Modern Political Thought with him last semester and am taking Classical in the fall (Y382   381, respectively), but he also does a class on happiness that I want to take so badly.  8) don't commit dormcest. It WILL be awkward.  9) your UD advisor is going to be shitty, no matter what. Deal with it, cuz you won't need him/her for long.  10) DON'T. EVER. SMOKE. WEED. IN. YOUR. DORM. ROOM. EVEREVEREVEREVER.  Edit: 11) get a job at some point, even if it's just for a summer. You don't want to graduate with a four-year-old resume, or worse, no resume at all.  	109

It gives me special powers OK   Tell me how?    Brand name?    I'm sure people who kill can not control their rage during the moment of the kill, unless you speak of sociopaths or psychopaths who enjoy that moment. During this moment of the kill murderer's do not care about what troubles they will run into in the future. 'Normal' murderers realize the ramifications only after their acts; this is why 'normal' murderers run away from the scene of the crime or attempt to dispose of the body and the evidence,  obviously not very well  since they are caught fairly 'fast' unlike serial killers whom are caught only after a spree.   Allowing the victims family to deal with the murderer is a primitive idea, because who is to say that the murderer's family will not go and kill someone in the victim's family?  These codes /rules/ laws exist in real life. For example if you look at Albania they have this code called the kanun, which dictates punishment like this.  When someone is killed by someone else then someone from the victim's family must seek revenge to honor the dead. This goes on until the males of the family is wiped out. However people stopped following the Kanun and do things their own way!    Following rules like you propose in your comment is destructive towards society because their will be retaliatory killings amongst the victim's family and the murderer's family. The victim's family becomes the murderer to the eyes of of the original murderer's family and then this family becomes the victim.  Not only is the community affected emotionally but the economic ramifications far out weigh the benefits because their will be a lack of people to work and stimulate the economy as a whole.   Even with strict rules to your proposition, the rules will not be an exegesis hence people will do as pleased. People will bend the rules and find loop holes.     That's a bit barbaric!

  Remember the reason the Soviet Union failed, and that there was no food on the shelves, is that nobody wanted to work. Incentivization was gone.  The important thing to remember is that UBI is giving people just enough to cover their basic needs. Something like $1,000 per month. There's still plenty of incentive to work, as very few people would be comfortable with $12,000 per year. I know I sure wouldn't.   Ha. Remember when toolbars were a thing?   If you got $1000 for free every month would you stop working?   Old people vote. Young people don't. That's why the country is considerably more liberal than the government.   We've needed this for so long (even if it's as simple as [this](http://i.imgur.com/Y792nwi.jpg)), especially since we've got two ults to choose from, usually based on comp, not to mention the other talents.   I like this idea, though it'd require publicly funded elections as well, since the corruption that currently plagues our political system would not be resolved by taking away government salaries.   /r/gogopgo   [This](https://youtu.be/ecIBE8zNimw?t=10m34s) should be easier.   Imagine that.   I still don't understand how openly opposing net neutrality isn't political suicide. It's 2015. Being against a free, open, and unconstrained internet is like being anti-puppy.  I suppose it helps that most of their voting base is using AOL (if anything), but still. Wow.   She sounds like the sorcerer's apprentice.   Downvoted, not for being wrong, but for the weird hybrid question/statement sentence.   Well one shot, one kill met.   I noticed that, too.    Just mute and move on.  Words to live by.   Good call, especially about the boss part. I should do a separate post about not doing mercs because they're there. It's gotten (understandably) really bad since launch, wherein I find myself answering "Boss?" where they're all up and we're down a person with a "No!" quite frequently.  The other merc camps can be just as bad, too, especially with heroes that can't clear them quickly (which includes Sylvanas, people). I can't tell you how many times I've seen a wipe caused by one person doing mercs for no reason while the rest of the team is fighting 4v5 (usually over a temple or a tribute).   If you lose someone before the team fight really even begins, disengage. Don't fight. One person down sucks, go do something productive instead of seeing how many kills you can feed them.  This one drives me crazy. It's such a simple, obvious combat, but I can't tell you how many times I've seen idiotic team members dash in to start a fight right after we lose someone.  "I'll avenge you!" No. You won't. You'll just wipe the team.    If both teams go 4-1 then you're both just mutually deciding to exploit each other in the same way, and then either team has an option to change things up to mitigate the other team's strategy.  Yes. If both teams go 4-1, neither has the advantage (from a lane setup perspective), but if one team doesn't, then the 4-1 will have the advantage. So with 4-1, the worst case scenario is no advantage, best case you've got a significant advantage.  I don't see why going 3-2 couldn't do fine against that depending on the comp.  They might be fine, but they're playing at a disadvantage. As I said, the lane with 2 in it isn't doing anything the lane of 1 isn't, and now the lane of 3 is down a person that might secure a kill, prevent a death, etc..    kill your 2  That's kind of a big assumption, isn't it? Why can't the 2 at bottom just play really passively, soak, poke, and NOT DIE?  You're right. They can do exactly that. And in that case, you just keep them bottled up and wait for a good opportunity, making sure all 3 lanes are soaking.   Yeah, it's 4-1 before the mines, then all 5 in the same entrance for the mines, then all 5 killing the golem (unless your golem is huge). From there in theory you'd go back to 4-1, but that rarely happens. It's mostly just the start of the game.   What part don't you follow?   Sadly, I think this has been happening for years in various parts around the country.   Ha, fair enough.   How do you deal with a 1-1-3, wherein the solo top just soaks while the 3 bot kill your 2, secure the shrine, and then rotate up?    PSA: Soak until 10, prioritise team fight above 10.  Agreed.   Very true, and very good.   It's a matter of who votes. The older you are, the more likely you are to vote, and the less likely you are to support legalization. That's why the country is far more liberal than the government is.   If the 3 is on top it's pretty reasonable.    I'm one of those Californians who never has, and never will smoke pot. But I would vote to legalize it because I'm convinced it doesn't hurt society, but enforcing pot laws does.  Same on all counts (except being a Californian).   Had to solo bot with Johanna in my last game (on Blackheart's) because Sylvanas went top :(.  Johanna's fantastic in a solo lane (because she's unkillable, and she has great wave clear), and I even managed to out-push the Zagara against me, but still. It was Sylvanas...   How is that bullshit? That's what they're reporting...   When in actuality it's "free market", "small government" republicans. Well that and the alcohol, for-profit prison, and other lobbyists helping them get re-elected.   I don't know of a reason not to do 2-1-2 (or maybe 1-3-1) on the spider queen map. Would be interested to hear if anyone knows otherwise.   A significant 437 megawatts of solar panels were installed in the first quarter, which was a 76 percent increase from the first quarter of 2014, said the report.  Your profits grew by 437 megawatts ;)   What the hell was that? Everything of substance was edited out of the video.   Grats!  Share some tips?   People shouldn't quit, period. I can't tell you how many games I've seen where one team has been way, way down the entire game, only to come back for a sudden, crazy victory. The only commonality between all of those games is that no one on the team that came back stopped trying.  Also, it's a game, and games are about having fun. Even I'm the only one up with the entire enemy team and a 100 skull totem on our core, I still try and get that last kill for fun.  Anyone who surrenders is denying their team a chance at a comeback, and themselves the opportunity to enjoy the game a little more.   Feel the hatred of 10,000 hues!   Well fought. I concede.   The progressives are the ones fighting for legalization. It's the right's voting base that's against it.    he can hop his ass on the next slow boat to Cuba.  Actually, [he can't](http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory/gop-led-house-votes-restrictions-travel-cuba-31529147).   Thanks for sharing this.   When it suits them.    it's annoying as @%!$.  FTFY   Only when it suits them.   I see what you did there.   Wait, you mean Frostbolt can be used on minions and the enemy hero as well?   He's not. Nobody actually paying attention favors keeping it illegal. He's just in some industry's pocket: Alcohol, for-profit prisons, cartels, etc.. Those are really the only people hurt (and, more importantly, not tremendously helped) by legalization, so they're the ones paying to keep it illegal.    Yes, a lot more people smoke pot, openly.  FTFY    Wait, so a Republican candidate is promising to stomp all over state's rights if he gets elected? Either I'm missing something here or he is a even bigger moron than I already thought he was.  What you're missing is that republicans are for states rights and smaller government only when it aligns with what they want. They have no problems with the government oppressing gay rights, waging a counterproductive war on drugs, subsidizing fossil fuels, etc..   Contacted the mods. Seems it was a mistake of some sort and they've fixed it.  Thanks for pointing this out.   Not going to go into it, but if you do even a small bit of research, you'll see there are many strong reasons for legalization, and more importantly that keeping it illegal causes some huge problems. I'd suggest you look into the issue a little deeper.   Ah, and then 20 is "Hero of the Storm"?   Thanks. I wasn't sure what the pattern was.   Not necessarily. I don't think that Zagara's hydralisks preclude the possibility of a hydralisk hero, for example, and don't forget that Tyrael and the Angelic Valla skin both exist.   Sorry, thought I'd stripped the timestamp out :(   That was super fun. Loved the music.  If you do another, maybe cut down on the number/duration of the ones that just throw things at the spawn point. Didn't find that as interesting, but the rest was great.  Well done.   I've been with and loved Google's ecosystem ever since Gmail launched, though I didn't switch to Android until about a year ago. I always liked my iPhones (3G, 4, and then 5), and only switched because I dropped and shattered my 5 mid-contract. I figured since I was so embedded in Google's ecosystem anyway, I'd see what the fuss was all about.  So I got a Moto X 2013, and was struck right away how much faster, smoother, and reliable my iPhone 5 was, despite the fact that it was 1.5 years older. I was really amazed how buggy Android is. Apps crashed all the time, I had huge problems connecting to Bluetooth devices, Chromecast doesn't work nearly as well as it did in my iPhone (which is not at all what you'd expect), and it's slow as hell.  Over time I've kind of gotten used to it, and I must say that a lot of the issues have gotten better. iOS is still a much smoother and user friendly experience. Any time I use my wife's 3 year old iPhone 5, I'm blown away by how responsive, fast, and fluid it is. Android still hasn't caught up in that regard. It's not even close.  The other thing that really sucks is the fragmentation and lack of updates. I chose the Moto-X because everyone said it would get fast updates. It took 2 months to go from 4.4.2 to 4.4.4 (we never got 4.4.3 at all), and I'm at about 6 months waiting on Android 5. It's also not nearly a customizatable as I'd heard. You can specify default apps for actions, which is nice, and I'm sure that if I jumped through some hoops and found some homebrew solutions to things, I could make a few things happen how I like, but most of the time if I want to change something, there's no solid solution to do it. The phone unlocks a lot in my pocket, for example, and I wanted to change the slide mechanism to be more like iOS's, wherein it goes the whole width of the phone and in only one direction. Nope. Not possible.  All in all, Android is pretty rough and it has some huge flaws and shortcomings compared to iOS.  That said, I don't think I'll ever go back, and it comes down to three things:  1. The ecosystem. This really is number one. I can tie everything together, and my devices can talk to each other. Everything ties in through my Google account, and it's really great. 2. It does more. While iOS does many things better than Android, it simply doesn't have the same capabilities. This isn't a huge deal, but it is something that I've learned to appreciate. 3. The things that it does better, it does WAY better. Maps, voice control, cross-app integration, etc..  So while I don't love Android, I am happy that I switched. If it weren't for the ecosystem, I'd probably go back, but Apple's ecosystem is terrible, so here I stay.  I hope this helps, and if you have any specific questions, feel free to ask.   More Starcraft and Diablo characters, particularly more zerg, protoss, and angels.   Wall is picked quite often. Used properly under the right conditions it is considerably more powerful than archon.   Can confirm. Archon definitely cannot kill a friendly Valla that quickly.   IT FUCKING HAPPENED. THEY CALLED THE GAME "DONE" WITHOUT ADDRESSING THE FACT THAT ONE OF THE MOST ICONIC CHARACTERS, THE FUCKING ARCHANGEL OF JUSTICE, ESSENTIALLY DOESN'T HAVE A HEROIC TRAIT!  5% DAMAGE REDUCTION, THAT'S ALL THEY HAVE TO DO. IT'S NOT OP, IT'S PROBABLY EVEN WORSE THAN HIS CURRENT TRAIT, BUT YOU'D NEVER LOOK BACK ON A GAME AND THINK "MY TRAIT DID NOTHING".  'CAUSE AS A TYRAEL MAIN, RIGHT NOW MY TRAIT DOES NOTHING.  DELAUNCH AND FIX IMMEDIATELY!   How about summoned creatures, like Zagara's hydralisk? Do any of them award experience?   I had no idea. Thanks!   Great little story.   Really?   First four are great. Hell no to mind flay. Your hand is, and should be, sacred.   I tried AMD the last time around. The thing that guaranteed that I will never make that mistake again was the fact that nearly every time I updated my drivers, I had problems. It got so bad that I would go 6 months between updates, because I didn't want to deal with the hassle.   Now that I'm back with Nvidia, I update every month. It takes 1 minute, no reboot, no problems.    Swimming, definitely. Swimsuits are pointless and awful.   Seriously, these 2 universes are also part of Heroes of the Storm  Technically true.  not just Warcraft  Actually true (sadly).   Thanks. Of course.   Thanks. I appreciate your support.   Guess which quest I just got.   Old people vote, young people don't, and thus the country is significantly more liberal than its representation.   No deal. Assassin is my least favorite role.  I actually really do like supports and specialists, I've just kind of overdone them due to all of these quests and I'd love to play some warrior (my favorite).    they aren't going to let you reroll your quest until you get a quest that lets you play the same one hero you always pick.  Two things:  1. I play tons of different characters. I don't have a "character that I always pick". 2. I've gotten practically (maybe even literally) nothing but specialist and support quests for the past week. The reason for this post is because I'm sick of playing those two roles (both of which I normally enjoy, but it's getting a little crazy). The current system isn't exactly diversifying things for me.   Not so! RCV's already in place around the country, and growing, thanks largely (though not entirely) to [citizen intiatives](http://www.pressherald.com/2014/11/12/ranked-choice-voting-advocates-gathered-36000-signatures-on-election-day/). Much like marijuana legalization.    the only way we have a chance of doing anything about it is if we start managing to elect unelectable politicians.  They're only unelectable because [we're using a sucky electoral system](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7tWHJfhiyo list=PL-cJs8aiZ912jQj_X1i91gvc1gbkCc0FD).   I miss the square of the 90's, when the games were great, and the titles made sense.  Though to be fair, while Type-0 HD is awful, nothing will ever beat Kingdom Hearts 358/2 Days. You gotta wonder if someone just dropped a coffee mug on the keyboard, and thought "Sure, that's the title".   You gotta wonder what the harm is in giving us an approximate time. Yes some people will be mad *if* the time slips, but everyone *is* mad that we're all just sitting here hitting refresh. If I were Blizzard, I'd take the possible heat over the definite.   Just watched this and can't help but think that the same people being screwed by this massive chicken corporations are almost undoubtedly voting for the republicans fighting the regulations that could protect them from these abuses.   I love these so much. Can't wait for specialist!   I wonder how many talk show hosts they polled. There can't be that many of them.    Obviously those tactics are not working, as the gap keeps growing larger.  But we're not doing those things. We raise the minimum wage very infrequently, certainly not keeping up with inflation, and the rich seem to get a new tax break every week.  Seems to me like we're doing the opposite of those things, and *that's* why the gap is growing.   I believe the loan is unaffected by the tax rebate. So you'd still owe the bank (or whomever) $20k, but you'd pay $6k less in taxes, so you could put that, which would normally have gone to taxes, towards the loan.   June 1st?   Yeah, I've thought about Rehgar front-loading his re-mount CD as well. Edge cases, but not nothing.  I was joking about the keys, I would probably bind it to CTRL+Z or something. I've never intentionally dismounted (except maybe to dance before the game starts), but you never know.   Contact your local democratic party. They'll point you in the right direction.   My hopes for launch are the same for every patch for about as long as I've been playing:  1. A Tyrael trait rework. 2. Judgement's many bugs being fixed. 3. The ability to bind the mount and dismount commands to different keys. Mount I'll keep on Z, and I think dismount will move to CTRL+ALT+SHIFT+F8+Scroll Lock. Because why would I ever want to go slower?  Not asking for much, but sadly I've been asking for a long time.   I hope this turns out to be true, but who's not playing yet that wants to? There have been excess keys floating around for months. I don't see a big flood of new players coming.  But I hope I'm wrong.   Thank you for translating, and for Blizzard for giving the noobs some very easy characters for launch week. Can't screw that list up too badly. No Nova, Illidan, Abathur, or Hammer.   Got one in my neighborhood, too.  Prices are falling rapidly. We'll have ours soon enough.   Didn't notice that. My bad.   Agreed. They rage so hard when you do this, but anyone who thinks a 2v4 is a good idea is probably going to find something to rage about eventually.   Didn't notice that until you pointed it out. No idea. Weird.   I think that statistic speaks more towards the owners than the dogs.   Seems fitting. Small heals are kind of Tyrande's thing.   Thanks. I wondered the same thing.   It's a child, either literally or emotionally. Just report and don't give him a second of your time.   Two things:  First, EVERYONE is talking about Anub'arak. Constantly.  Second...  but a 61% Anub is untouched.  It hasn't even been 3 weeks. I'm sure Blizzard is aware of how ~~kinky~~powerful Anub'arak has become, but it would be pretty rash of them to make an adjustment so quickly.   Or even better, do both!   Kinda hard for the homeless to make use of solar panels...  Glibness aside, I take your point, that they could be giving that money to someone even more needy. I think the idea is that it's an investment. Sort of a "teach a man to fish" kind of thing, wherein the value of the solar panels over time will grow beyond the initial cost, thus the recipients get more bang for the state's buck.   I get (and very much like) this:  Every 6 weeks to launch two heroes.  But can anyone decipher this part:  The current plan is that after all will be made every 6 weeks may contain two new heroes of the big patch, one of the heroes of the patch while online, while the other is unlocked after a period of time the patch. (like Johanna)   Solar panels work when it's not sunny, too. Just not as well.   I do this a lot, too, trying to maximize my laning time as best as I can, based on the situation.   Correct.   I try and do this on my when when I've got a health globe talent and a hero that I feel can pull it off without missing out on experience or putting myself at risk. Tyrael, for example, can bring down a wave quickly, as well as use his Q to get there in time.  Often only possible on the smaller maps, like the tomb or Dragonshire, and doing this can also be a bit of a mana drain, but if you can pull it off, it helps a lot.   Thank you.   The damage is nice, but incidental. The silence is the team killer.   Just as long as nobody who has ever worked on NCIS is involved.    I'd be happy if they simply sorted alphabetically by default. I never find myself wanting to sort by release date.  Even better would be if it remembered the sorting and filters. So if I sort by price and come back to the store, it's still sorted by price.    Why do you feel like you need to be rewarded for every step  That's a bit of a stretch. I said when you hit 60 with a class. That's hardly "every step".  Anyway, most of us don't care about golden cards we're never going to use. As such, it's not really a reward, and I think hitting 60 is a significant accomplishment that the user should be rewarded for.    Loki is kind of a special case: I may change Loki's wording, but I never change his mind.  This is awesome, and I think that this is exactly what makes you such a great writer.   Making good use of that golden Dalaran Mage, are you?   There's the "pro life party of small government" in action.   Very pretty. Nice job!   Somewhere around $80-90. A bundle or two and a few heroes.   * A useful Tyrael trait * The ability to bind the dismount button to something other than the mount button * Spectator Mode * More Diablo heroes   Since you're a first-timer, you should call-ahead and let them know you're coming anyway, and that would be a great time to ask. Takes the guess work out of it.   His parents knew, early on, that diarrheafarts88 was destined for greatness.   First of all, you're a fantastic writer, and I can't wait to see what you're working on next.  My question is, how do you strike the balance between a character doing what would be natural for him/her, and with what you need them to do to further the plot or a particular part of the story? And for that matter, who would you say is more in charge: you or the characters?  Thanks, and keep up the great work!   Yeah. Every hero has a trait, which is usually (but not always) a passive ability that helps set them apart. Diablo's soulstones, Nova/Zeratul's cloaking, Kerrigan's shield generation, etc..  Tyrael does have one (I was just being bitter), his explodey angel death bomb, but it's both terrible and practically non-existent. Everyone is begging for Blizzard to replace it with something that actually affects the game, and that doesn't reward Tyrael for doing his job poorly.  As far as buying him, I highly recommend him, as he's both fun and power, though he is somewhat of a challenging hero to play effectively. Unlike Diablo, Muradin, ETC, etc., who can just jump in, push the enemy around, and take a beating, Tyrael requires a a good bit of judgement (plenty of pun intended) to know when to initiate and press an attack. And you really have to be diligent keeping an eye on your back line, since you don't really have a hard disengage.  That said, when you do get a feel for him, you can really punish the enemy for their greed and foolishness. Smart enemies learn very quickly if the Tyrael that they're facing is dangerous and treat him with respect. Weak enemies simply face justice and die.  And that's why I love him.   Do you wear a two-piece to go swimming?   How about free arena run every time you hit level 60 with a class, so there actually a reason to do it.   it's super lucrative.  For the gangs, cartels, and for-profit prisons, maybe. For the rest of us, it's super costly, both in taxes and in lost/destroyed lives.   Here's the GDC talk about what they did and the positive effects it had:  http://gdcvault.com/play/1017940/The-Science-Behind-Shaping-Player  Really fascinating stuff.   All you do by prematurely declaring a loss is make it more likely to happen. There is no situation where demoralizing your team is a good idea, particularly when you're already down.   I'm not. It's really quite easy to stay alive in a lane that's pushed, as you're never far from your towers, and usually behind them. You just soak safely and bring down the wave as fast as you can, weakening it in advanced with ranged AoE, if you can. The towers take minimal damage, you're at almost no risk, and the other lanes have the safety/advantage of large numbers.  This is what the solo lane on haunted mines usually does against 4 enemy heroes. It's particularly annoying when people don't know to do this and you end up 2-3, which puts the group lane down a person (3v1 instead of 4v1), and there's very little difference between a 1v4 and a 2v4, except that the lane doesn't push as hard and you're actually at more risk.   Great idea and tips!  When Riot did this, they saw toxicity in league drop noticeably.   Tyrael. Total badass. If only he had a hero trait.   We're funding both sides of the "war on drugs", and it's super frustrating.   You are a good person.    The car doesn't support Android Auto  And sadly it sounds like there are no plans to. Though they said that this is because they want to go "another way" with phone integration. We'll see what that means, I suppose.   Does he have the authority to do that?   I see your point, but I very much disagree that a 2-mana Shield Bearer sucks as much for the mage as a turn 3 Cairne sucks for the opponent. The former is slightly unfortunate, the latter is incredibly powerful.   Pretty sure. Maybe he lunges and stands around while he waits for the next auto attack to be ready?   I've seen some really outrageous combinations of ranks. One game our team had one 30+, and then something like two 1's, a 3, and an 8, and under, and the other team was all around 15. They're absolutely crazy.  I think the game tries to match based on what it thinks your rank *should* be. Frankly, if they're going to do it that way, they should do it like Starcraft 2 does it. You're in various leagues, bronze through diamond/master, and when the system thinks you're ready to move up, you do. I think if HotS did it this way, you'd settle on a more appropriate rank much quicker, and you'd end up with fewer huge variances in skill/rank.  At the very least I think they should do away with the "skill based" matchmaking and stick with simple rank based matching, at least until they can do a better job determining "skill".   Nothing. I was being sarcastic, because the Lollipop update is taking forever (going on 6 months) and they periodically say they're "preparing the update", which doesn't seem to mean anything.   This is amazing. I know nothing about tools, machining, engineering, or really anything, but I'm enthralled and have learned already.  Thanks for sharing this!   As someone who made the decision to get the 2013 based promises of "fast updates", and is going on 6 months of waiting for Lollipop, I am not.   With any luck, they'll be preparing to do the update, for the third time, this week!   Nice job!  Auriel is one of the characters that I'm most looking forward to.   Buying politicians.    I think society's views on nudity are super fucked up. We're taught to be ashamed of our bodies and that nudity is equivalent to sex. Furthermore, the very definition of "nudity" is really confusing. Why is a topless man totally innocent, but a topless woman is something obscene and inherently sexual. And then even going one step further, why is it the nipple, specifically, that is the "dirty part"? And why are we mature about some nudity (locker rooms, the doctor's office, etc.), knowing full well that it isn't sexual, but swimming naked is only something you do on a dare, and if you're caught, you're arrested and labeled a sex offender?  It's all just a bunch of stupid arbitrary rules, some of which are blatantly sexist double standards, based on Victorian prudishness that have caused severe psychological damage on a societal level. That may sound overstated, until you remember that "nip slips" are not only a thing, but there are entire websites built and monetized around them. Or even worse, there are some that consider breastfeeding to be something shameful that must remain hidden. We've latched on to these ridiculous Victorian principals, and the result is infants eating in public restrooms.  Here's another gem of a societal norm: (female) nipples, vaginas, penises, and butts are to be hidden at all time. So if you go swimming, to avoid people looking at them, place a small strip of brightly colored cloth to cover only those areas, specifically the color of those areas, because the shape is anything but concealed once wet. That will surely draw attention away from them, and take the sexuality out of the situation! /s  Swimsuits, like the rest of what we do to "protect" people from nudity, are completely pointless, and counterproductive. If you want to sexualize a pat of the body, make everyone cover it up under all circumstances. That's how you end up with people turned on by bare ankles.  So to answer the question, I think the nudists have it right. If we simply stopped caring about who sees what part of our body, the so-called "private parts" would very quickly lose their fascination, and all of body shame, sexualization of nudity, and all of the other damage caused to society by the prohibition of simple, non-sexual nudity would fade away almost immediately. In other words, we'd act like adults, even without our clothes on.  TL;DR - Swimsuits suck, nudity is only a big deal because we make it one, and the nudists have it right.   I guess if you can only see what the person you're spectating sees, that would be fine. No different than having someone else in the room.  I was just thinking that you could see anything, but what you propose is probably better.   Yeah, though a 1-2 minute delay is fine and solves the cheating problem.   Diablo is very weak early now, but once he hits mid/late game, I actually think he's a lot stronger now. His health pool is massive, like 8.4k, and the new ability at 20 is sweet.  Plus, I really like how he seems to have more viable talents now, as opposed to one really obvious talent at every level.  I like the new ETC, but I didn't play a lot of the old one, so I can't really speculate. I dislike that they've added another death-based ability, though. Speaking as a Tyrael main, I really hate those.   I wonder how republicans feel about this.   Thanks.   How does it work? Did you enable it through the Google app?   Doesn't matter. Being restricted to the free heroes is infinitely better than not being able to play at all.   Didn't care until I saw this:  When a regions game servers are undergoing maintenance, you may use the Global Play feature to log in to a different region that is not down for maintenance.  Now I care! Awesome!   I think it's more accurate to say that Anub was fixed, not buffed. The decreased casting delays are technically more of a buff, but I think the more significant change was that the beetles actually do what they're supposed to, now.   YEAH, THAT'S ILLIDAN'S JOB!   I CANNOT BELIEVE THAT THIS GAME IS GOING TO LAUNCH WITH NO WAY TO UNBIND THE USELESS DISMOUNT BUTTON FROM THE BUTTON THAT DOES THE EXACT OPPOSITE! WHEN I PRESS Z I ALWAYS WANT TO GO FASTER, NEVER SLOWER!  REMOVE THE DISMOUNT BUTTON OR LET US BIND IT TO A DIFFERENT KEY!   That mini-gravbomb looks crazy powerful.   Thanks   What does "backtrain" mean?   "Nah." -- republicans   These are great and I can't wait for the specialists one!   Yup. She destroyed us single-handedly.   It's not live in the US yet?   Nope. NA.   It's gotta be a bug. She's surviving 1v4s.   The state shouldn't murder people. Especially innocent people.    Stupid things like "went to pot", " to boot", etc., that don't really make sense but people keep using them.     Bill Richards urged the jury to not pursue the death penalty.  If not for the victims, it makes you wonder who we're imposing the death penalty on behalf of.  And, of course, the answer is "pro life" republicans.   WHY IS THE DISMOUNT BUTTON STILL A THING! IT SERVES NO PURPOSE! REMOVE IT OR LET US MOVE IT TO SOMETHING THAT ISN'T ALSO THE MOUNT BUTTON!!   Brilliant!   Agreed. I wish they were in a more easily viewable location, as well. It can be unsafe to sneak a peak down at the corner of the screen in many situations, especially for those of us with large displays.   Definitely feeling the loss of the rockstar timer.   Armageddon and Deep Impact.   In the summer of 1997, an asteroid threatens to end life as we know it. Can a specialized team plant a nuclear weapon below the surface of the killer rock before it's too late? And then can they do it again?   I know. I mean, maybe a Squirt machine...   I love it, too, though I'm still getting used to it. I still have moments where I'm like "C'mon, Stunned! Don't just stand there!"   There are dozens of us. Dozens!   Perhaps. I don't remember the exact circumstances, but I was pretty sure that she hadn't done anything like that.   Maybe. Haven't had any issues with latency lately, but perhaps.   Speaking on behalf of all of the Tyrael mains, please fix the trait before Sanctification. I know Sanctification isn't picked, but we're all stuck with Archangel's Wrath.  Judgement could also use some fixing, too. It often hits the wrong target, and the misfires at max range or when the target goes out of sight are incredibly frustrating. It's a fantastic ult, but missing a brief, but important, window to use it because it's so clumsy is really painful.  We know his win rate is high, and we don't disagree that he's a great warrior (and a total bad ass), but we could really use a few quality of life upgrades (and an actual trait) to make him a little smoother to play.  Thanks!   Actually they were about 20 minutes early with the last patch, I believe.   Fair enough. Thanks.    potentially his level 20 breath upgrade  You actually take that? The shield was incredibly powerful, and even if the new ability didn't look great (which it does), I'd take bolt over both of the ult upgrades.  I don't really think breath range or duration are all that useful, particularly the latter. Care to change my mind?    The new death metal seems terrible. ETC is really easy to keep alive. You typically have enough move speed, escapes and sustain to never die unless you want to. You essentially have to waste your level 20 talent to get an ability that makes you WANT to suicide. So not only are you now having to choose to kill yourself, but waste a talent getting that privilege. Also im assuming it will have the same wind up animation as normal mosh pit, AND you will [probably be a different ghost color, making it super obvious for people to GTFO, so most likely it will never hit anyone anyways.  As a Tyrael main, all I can say is be grateful that this is a talent, not your trait.   I don't know how powerful he'll be, but I really like this rework, because it seems like he has many more viable and fewer undeniable talents now. I can see making a decision at every level, instead of just picking "the right one".  One of my favorite things about playing Jaina is that I never build her the same way twice, and I can see this new Diablo potentially possessing that same level of viable variability.    The hope is that the release will eventually increase the pool of players to allow you to have an enjoyable casual 5 stack.  Don't see how. Anyone that wants to play already can. Not sure where this whole other population of players will come from.  I hope I'm wrong, because matchmaking is a nightmare right now.   Fantastic idea!   Glad of this, too. Hope to see this continuing in the future. Even earlier, preferably. Once the game is down for the patch, I don't see a  reason to delay publishing the patch notes.   I was really expecting a back-door Abathur. None in game. Well done!   There are two issues:  1. Tyrael will very often switch the target of judgement to another enemy (minions and mercs included). So you'll select Zeratul and it'll be ETC that gets hit with the primary effect. 2. Not technically a bug, but Tyrael will cancel judgement mid wind-up if the target goes out of range or sight. So you use the ability on a target in range, Tyrael stops moving, dismounts, shouts "embrace judgement!", and then does nothing. It's incredibly frustrating, and it makes the ability extremely difficult to use effectively at max range or near bushes.   I love the changes to Diablo. I can't say how it will affect how powerful he is, but now each level has several very compelling choices, rather than one obvious choice for 90% of the time. One of my favorite things about Jaina is that I build her differently each game, because almost all of her talents are viable, and I can definitely see this new Diablo being another hero like that.  Really super sad that Tyrael's trait and Judgement's bugs haven't been addressed, though. That's always the first thing I look for in each patch.   And is there a patent on the antidote? If there's nothing proprietary, what's stopping your competitor from making the same antidote and crushing you like the cockroach that you are?  Also, the police.   Agreed. I feel like it's possible for someone to be in a rank that isn't commensurate with their actual skill level, but I think that that's something that will self-correct over time. Until they can devise a way to realistically and accurately assess skill, I think that that's the best that you can really do.   I wonder about this, too. It seems pretty simple to me, especially because the matchmaking takes place before hero selection.  I think they try and match based on "skill", not rank, but frankly I don't think that there's really an effective way to programatically determine skill. Obviously Blizzard disagrees, but the result is not all that convincing.   WHAM!   Yup. True story.   Yeah, I definitely agree they shouldn't try and cram a hero into one of those roles for that, or any other, reason.    I'm more of the stance that they should design what works best for the character, without worrying about getting every category filled.  I can respect that, but we're really only talking about 2 more heroes. Not that they should make a character a warrior/support for this reason, but they should priorities a Starcraft support and a Dialo support. Push Fenix and Deckard, the monk, or some supporty angel (Auriel maybe) up in the pipeline and then it's done.   As much as I'd like her to be a support, I think there's almost no chance of it. She screams warrior.   Interesting how the legendary tint is the second one.   My bad.   Contact support. They'll help you pinpoint the issue.  	200

 Agreed. They are a fashion statement around here (where I live. Not Reddit). People wear them around their necks. I assumed the design insinuated headphones, but apparently they are neck wear   No, BCGs take that honor.   Then my brother would walk around naked. no one wants they. Trust me.   My comment was a Scrubs reference.   Man is the only animal that wears pants during twosies.   I didn't think about that. Hmm... well good luck to anyone with that issue.   Thanks so much. I completely understand that. Worded perfectly   /r/milf   I do this too, though now it's just memory. I don't even think about it.   I've had trouble with this before. Why should I respect you just because you were born long enough before me? What's that have to do with respect? If idk you, fuck you. You have no claim to respect just because of your age. You could be a no respect deserving asshat and I should respect you because you've seen the 18-fucking hundreds? Fuck you. You might be a child diddler. I don't know. Fucking old people.   One other thing, how do we as humans know what animals see? How do we know certain animals can see x amount of colors more than we do? If a. We can't see these extra colors b. We can't see through the animal's eyes Then how do we know? Or how do we know which animals see in color and which see in black and white? As far as I know, in reality, animals do not speak our language. Animals can't just say "I see in black and white" or "how many colors do your eyes acknowledge? Mine acknowledge x amount more. Lame human" It just baffles me.    I don't get total blindness. It might be due to the fact I was blessed with sight, but the idea of total blindness eludes me. The brain processes everything. What process replaces sight when one is blind. There must be something the brain "sees", ironically. Is it total darkness? The eyes must tell the brain something. There can't be no message from the eyes to the brain. It just doesn't make sense. The crazy thing is, I completely understand being completely deaf. Sound doesn't make it to the brain. What happens to visuals between the eye and the brain? Where does the image go? Does the brain just tell itself that everything is pitch black?   I have friends I've known for many years that have been music nerds since Jr. High school and some since elementary. They try to explain it every time I ask. After they finish, I remember why I don't ask. They explain it to me the same way they'd explain it to one another. Every time I'm like "Explain it like I'm slow because with this, I am." Still, they explain it like I know wtf is going on.   When I was very young I was taught that if you put your hands in front of you and make an "L" with each hand, the one that looks like the letter "L" on paper, that hand is your left. If the "L" you made looks like it's backward, it's your right hand. I hope this makes sense and helps.  Btw, your hands must be facing away from you so you see the backs of them.   I know the feeling. My dad has a great inner compass. Couldn't have passed it on genetically? Jerk!   We had those little bags of milk in school... I hated it. I'd end up poking the little straw all the way through and wind up with milk everywhere. I HATED it!   For a second, I didn't see the "nail" part and thought you found a whole finger.   I know a Brandy who loves pizza enough to eat it daily. Hell, I'm married to her...   Unless thou art the only one around. Or if it's chocolate milk.   My wife hated the movie because "it's nothing like the book". So I told her think of it as two separate entities.   Close but not Josh. More like John.   I love Jimmy eat world. That song does it for me too. If you know the background behind it, it's even more sad.   I don't see this one on here so: congratulations - blue October   Working on my car successful or not. Whether I appear frustrated or angry. I'm actually happy deep down.   For me, it's my beard.    I wish I read this comment before my last reply. My step mom and your dad would get along except she's difficult on the laundry too.   My step mom was like this. Pissed me off.   When I still lived at home, I was allowed to stay as long as I needed but my parents (dad and step mom) had to be able to view my bank account at any given time. This was not a problem since I don't buy much anyway. My problem was the confusion in this rule. My dad said "You shouldn't just go to work, come home, go to work come home and so on. Anyone who works should reward himself every payday with a little something. Even just a cola on the way home from work." Which I did... then my step mom, within minutes of the purchase, would call my cell phone and bitch me out her : "What did you buy just now?" Me: "I stopped and got a soda for a dollar twenty five" her: " You're supposed to be saving so you can move out!" Me: "I suppose a dollar and a quarter will prevent that huh?" Her: "that's not the point, you need to save everything! You'll never make it on your own if you don't learn to manage your money!" Me: "so a dollar twenty five per week on myself is poor management? Hmm, then with that logic, I'm not as bad as you and dad right? Because a hundred dollars every other week going out to eat has to be worse financially" her: "Don't let it happen again!" Call ends. It was like having two different bosses. Ridiculous bullshit.   Oh, my God! I'm gagging and vomiting at the same time. I'm... I'm gavomiting!   Wow I thought my wife was the only one. She gets mad if I don't understand what she's talking about our if I'm confused.   My wife does this to me... when she pinches really hard, I react with an "ouch" or something similar and she gets mad telling me she didn't do anything.    If it's only meant to be viewed on internet exploder, then it's a waste of time. Also, the coder must not be aware of the fact that ie's last few users are mostly people's grandparents who will soon die.   My car battery had completely died and lucky enough for me, I had the cash to buy a new one. My car is a 2004 Chrysler Sebring 4 cylinder, 2.4l. With this particular car, you must get behind the wheel well of the front left (driver's side) tire to get to the battery. I got about half way through and it started pouring down rain. I couldn't leave everything as it was because my tire could get stolen or my newly paid for battery could get stolen. I'd be in some real problems then. Anyway, I couldn't get the tire to line up with the bolts so I could put the lug nuts on. I was getting frustrated. Cars and people passed by without even looking at the situation. Had it not been pouring rain, and about 30 degrees Fahrenheit, I would have been fine, but I was freezing and soaked. This guy finally stopped and told me to jack my car up some more (i thought it was already up as far as possible). After a few minutes of that, he had it all lined up and tightened the lug nuts so I was ready to go. Btw, I normally don't have trouble with this stuff, just cold rain makes it seem more complicated.  Tl;dr: I was putting my tire back on my car in pouring rain while it was 30 degrees out (Fahrenheit) and after an hour someone came and helped.   Yeah it feels weird and I feel if I say something it'll ruin the moment enough, she'll stop with the head.   What's pink and red and scratches at glass?  A naked mole rat in a microwave.  What's pink and red and sits in a corner? A naked mole rat chewing on razor blades sitting in a corner.  What stinks, is green, and sits in a corner?  The same mole rat two weeks later.   Either: 2 pounds of marijuana, 2 pounds of hundred dollar bills, or 220 pounds of myself for throwing away my life savings in money and all that weed.  Edit: flubber.   Dell computers. Fuck Dell computers.    Yeah and ie is the best browser and bing should be your search engine...   I use MSE (Microsoft security essentials), it came with my computer. It does okay but only with full scans. If I do a quick scan, it doesn't find anything. I use the paid version of MBAM  (malware bytes anti malware). Mbam detects lots of stuff that mse detect. Mse find things mbam misses and vice versa. They work great together. No conflicts or anything.   I have ccleaner and use it weekly but I never ever ever ever use the registry cleaner. Fuck that. I only mess with registry keys individually. Ccleaner can clean temporary files only. On my computer at least.   I keep a usb drive with chrome install file handy. So it's actually so simple.   I remember him.    Seriously, a program called scorpion saver. Anything related to it. It'll interrupt plenty of important tasks and processes. I was updating a beta version of a game and it was constantly getting stuck at 30% and I uninstalled scorpion saver completely and the update worked.   My Wife's grandma's computer looks like this. Makes me cringe.   Falcon nw is awesome. Expensive, but worth it. The only pc I've ever owned that I didn't build was a Mach V from falcon. Still have it.   I hate Dell. Eww. I'd fall off the internet if Dell was my only choice. Also, I second the build your own pc thing. I've always owned personally built PCs   Trojans   My brother hates this too. My dad would purposely rub his hands/feet on the carpet to bug my brother.   Even worse for me is anything sticky. If I get seated at a restaurant and the table is sticky... no no no no. There is this dive bar here called "Hey Joe's", the tables are covered in news paper and magazine articles and sealed with a clear coat. Idk what happened, but someone fucked up, the clear coat is sticky. It's dry, but feels sticky, I refuse to eat there.   Fudge pops bother me more than popsicles.   I've never told anyone this but bare mattresses feel weird to me. Makes me cringe just thinking of the texture.   I didn't see this one but: The Purge.   It's like wiping peanut butter from a shag carpet. It's never truly gone. So I use wet wipes after tp.   I love them all. Anytime I go, they're having this deal where I think you buy five get one free or something. I usually do this twice and add 4 chocolate chip cookies for 25c each. I end up sick to the stomach pigging out. Worth it! They have this almond crunch one, little bitty almond pieces on a soft chewy cookie... heaven.  	54

 I really don't get all the commotion why people point out that Asians like taking pics of their food.  It's been a fad for awhile.  Now [this](http://www.instant-ramen.net/2009/05/how-asians-take-pictures/) on the other hand, is getting more buzz   I agree, if any of my fellow Niner fans acted out in disrespect, I'd call em out as well      Cards defense is legit.     Just for 1 day I'd love to see what it's like to be OLB stacked up 6'4 230.     touch of sesame oil at the end does wonders   Mexican tacos in a hardshell?  Gimme a fuckin break   you could do zucchini parm, and a oven roasted zucchini.     Recipe?    I got approached by this woman last weekend with my friend in midtown.  She came up from behind, rubbed my back and asked if we were working for some no name company.  She totally reeked of booze.  When I told her to fuck off, she walked away and essentially did the same thing in the video (stopping cars, flipping off people)     What's remarkable about him, is how passionate he takes his job.  Not saying that making sushi is mundane, but after doing it for over 50 years, he still takes his trade so seriously.  I think it's safe to say most of us get tired/bored of our jobs after awhile, especially if it's not challenging, or the pay is low.  This man gives his life to it.  Props   Son was born on the 4th day, 9th month.  Karmic message    You need a good skirt steak, marinated in lime juice, salt, garlic, pepper, onion, cumin, chilli powder, touch of olive oil tenderize it.  Grill it, or broil.  I'd go with canned black beans, im sure you can find a easy recipe for rice.  Get some cilantro, tomato, onion.  Cojita cheese.  Roll the bad boy up.    Same feeling.  I'd say he's entertaining   My neighborhood bar does Jameson with pickle backs.  Pretty smooth   Sade and Linda Carter   Thanks.  It's interesting getting peoples philosophies on FF.  Some say QB simply because he has the ball in his hands and makes the plays.  Others argue there's only a handful of elite WR's so you gotta get em fast.     Given Reddit's stance on cops, your answer is rare.  I raised that question because in other related threads, everyone is here bashing the cops left n right.     So the next question..Are you willing to pay taxes in order for police to get more efficient training?  On the importance scale from 1-10, and with budget restraints, where does this rank?     Groin stretches in a cageful of hungry tigers.  In all honesty, one of the worst ways to die would be to die with regret, and sorrow.  To realize you didn't live to the potential, and that you wasted your life and cannot take it back.      "hey watch this!"  a rednecks last words   that's the 1-2 punch on a hangover day (Sat+Sun).  Coffee and Pho      repost   I take things personally. I remind myself, it's never an attack on me, or that people are deliberately out to get me, but when I get upset that's usually the basis.     Return fire has no bearing on this matter.  He pointed a fucking gun in one of the busiest streets in the world.  Shit is gonna go down.    As for the bystanders, how fast can you process and react to what was happening around you?  Unless you grew up in a war torn country I.e Iraq, no way you would ever imagine a gun fight during morning commute.  Youre gonna run frantically, every which way possible.  Even towards the chaos.    Here come the Monday morning quarterback comments.  Look, you can sit here and analyze the video and say "the academy teaches you this and that," but at the end the officer put himself in the line of fire.   Im not siding with the cops, but it's real easy from our vantage point to criticize the way it was handled, incompetent or not.  Most cops never have use their firearm in their lifetime, esp nypd.     This site has a bunch of Batsu Games dating all the way back to the late 80's.  The most recent one is [amazing](http://gakifiles.blogspot.com/p/2012-airport-batsu-game-subtitle.html)   Should be fine, you're using some strong spices that beer won't alter the flavor.  Maybe add a touch of beef stock or water, but I wouldn't stress on it.  Post pics and let us know how it turned out.     You're claiming it's a myth, I'm arguing there is actual fact.  Grades might not be distinguished the same as beef (prime, choice, etc) but fresh fish that I was eating daily in Japan+NYC was "sashimi grade" compared to the places you've worked i.e (farm rasied)  Dunno where you live, but in NYC where I work and live, sashimi is flown in from Japan+Australia daily.    I agree places like Whole Foods will get away with their "sashimi" but scientific fact, when the brain of the fish is pierced and lactic acid is minimal, you're getting the best of the best.  I know that's what I'm getting.     How is it myth?  [fact](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sashimi)   My spider senses tingle the moment anybody approaches me with a story/scenario.  WTF is this guy approaching me is my mindset.     I remember Leisure Suit Larry    I remember that scene as a kid wondering what it was they were assembling together.  This is fantastic!      grate some ginger, slice some green onions, drizzle some seasame oil and soy sauce.  game, set, match   Sandusky Middle School!

Uhh, NYC has been under surveillance for years.  You can call it Big Brother, or whatever, since 9/11 the technology in this city is unparallel.     PMT is great.  I was intimidated by BDC student's and atmosphere.  I'm not bad, used to break for years but when I was at BDC, you can see/feel this sense of students always sizing you up.     Mexican officer, late 30's.  His partner was young 20 yr fresh out of the academy. Dude was so stoked to bust me.  I'm asian, in my 30's but young looking.  He didn't seem upset really, and I did not sound off at him.  It was a busy Friday night, streets were packed and people walking around.  Maybe it was the energy.  I do remember the commanding officer showed up in a unmarked car.  He asked the arresting officer, "do want to go ahead and process?"  Almost had my hopes up for second.    No fines.  Technically my case is sealed shut, but can re open if I do something stupid again.  As much as NYC is strict and cops are asses,it is one of the few states that is liberal for 1st time offenders of weed.  The ACD law has been around since the 70's.  I haven't done a background search on myself yet, but from what I've read the ACD is sealed from any outside sources.     Busted last summer on the corner of Bleeker and Bowery.  3 of us were passing a joint around on the street, cop car pulled up and arrested us on the spot.    The time frame last about 3 1/2 hours from beginning to end.  After getting printed, processed, and what seemed like an eternity, we were let go.  My court date was 2 months later.  That lasted 15 min tops, judge gave me a A.C.D (Adjournment for Court Dismissal). End of story.       Oh nice, i keep hearing how the Whitney and the new museum are worth checking out    Same here!

If you're on Oxy then you're even less inclined bc you'll be so subdued.  He might have been on anti-depressants, or some psycho tropic drug, but not pain meds.     They sweated him because he checked "yes" on whether he was arrested or not.  Plus he's famous.  Normal folks with a record can still get thru no problem.  When they scan your passport your personal history doesn't show up.  No such thing as private security companies, airports are government related in japan.  You are right about xenophobic   He only got caught bc he's famous, and he probably checked "yes" for have you ever been arrested.  I've got a record, and each time in customs I've gone thru no problem.  When your passport is scanned your criminal history doesn't show up unless for a serious offense i.e murder, drugs.  There's no way databases are linked globally at airports.     There's a woman on the corner of W 32nd and 7th ave, (next to Nathan's) that has a pillow stuffed under her stomach and begs for money all day.  It's upsetting because people actually fall for it.     You didn't answer the 2nd question.  If the higher ups failed to take any action, and Ramos was still out there doing his thing, what would you do?  How far do you go to see him get reprimanded?  Do you risk your own job?     It's hypothetical, but let's be real.  There's a general code amongst the blue boys.  My point is, there's Ramos everywhere doing illegal shit 24-7.  How much of it is tolerated is a question unanswered, but from an outsider, I wonder who would stand up and intervene.     Curious question.  Let's say you knew this guy Ramos, and what he was doing.  Would you turn him in?  One step further, let's say you do report him and no action was taken.  What lengths would you take to see him reprimanded?     Japanese guy here.  I must eat everything with rice.  And yes, KFC and rice is the bomb.

Karma whoring like what this kid right [here] (http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/tesnp/my_mom_died_in_a_car_accident_two_weeks_ago_this/)   sorry my dude, i got a few buddies named chad as well.  they all laugh it off   I was fortunate to go to private school bc my parents (japanese) believed in good education.  About 90% of my classmates were white, (wealthy white) while the other 10% were asian+black.  I was able to attend bc of finanical aid.  At a early age I saw firsthand just how different a mindset these kids had vs the minorities.  It was self entitlement and this general attitude of being spoiled and saying/doing outrageous shit thinking it's completely acceptable.    The one thing I still get annoyed with is when I deal with entitled rich white punks who think they run the shit.  It's a certain arrogance and mindset that exists.  Now that I'm living in NYC I see it 24-7 especially around midtown.  My friends and I like to call them Chad's + Brad's and or Wall St Douchebags.     Kinda didn't want to highjack this thread, but yeah block curry is uber artificial.     Yup the best.

When I have people over, I use a burner stove so that I can cook on the table, but you can also do it over stove top.  Not a rolling boil, but a good simmer.  The key is getting the beef cut super thin (paper thin 1/16").   You basically want to dip the meat and swirl in the water for a few seconds max.  Veggies will take longer.     Japanese style foundue minus the cheese.  Thin sliced meats and veggies get cooked quickly in a broth, and dip with sauces.     I used to work for a home health care agency, part of the job was to deliver meds to people with chronic illness.  One client was a 17 year old with severe arthritis which prompted him to be dependent on pain killers.  Month by month I noticed his orders of opiates began to increase not only in quantity but strength.  He began to lose weight fast, and his skin color was pale from being indoors.  It got so bad  there would be times I would go over to his house and while we were talking he would doze off in mid sentence.  One day during my delivery, I pulled him aside and told him my concern.  Of course this could have totally gotten me fired bc it really wasn't any of my business, but I felt the need to say something.  It was a short stern talk, and really didn't expect much from it.    A year later, and I moved to NY and I get a friend request from him on Facebook.  My eyes began to water as I looked thru his pictures.  Not only did he move out of his home, he got a job working IT, became super fit and tanned.  He thanked me the talk because no one else (not even mom) gave a shit.     That's bc it's mostly korean exchange students around that area.  (language schools)  Next time when you're inside, take a look around and see the average age.  Personally I love woorijip bc of their selection.       Katsuhama FTW.  Most japanese don't like go go    I always thought the murder of MJ's dad was tied into his gambling.      Von bar, bleeker and Bowery.  Walk in past the bar, make a right and there's a secret bar downstairs with a dance floor    Yeah I've been on C.L the last few days, I feel like the window for stolen goods is prob 48 hours tops before it gets flipped.     I just wanted to see the process from beginning to end of what exactly takes place.  I'd rather hear a cop be straight up and tell me "look, there's not much we can do." Giving me #'s to call, waiting for detectives is just wasting time.     Backstory:  Last nite I left the front window open in my living room, woke up in the morning to find the screen window busted open and 2 of my wife's lap tops missing.  The laptops were sitting on the couch.  It was a pretty brave move on the burglars part, only because he would have had to actually open a gate, peak in from a ledge, and then break the screen.  Either way, it was a shitty feeling, and we should have known better.     So we decide to call the cops, 4 huge dudes (more like gorillas) came in did some paper work, told us a detective would come by to do some prints.  They told us not to touch a thing because its all evidence, blah blah, and handed us a "incident information slip".  They gave us a # to call to report this matter in order to receive a complaint report #.  We've tried calling this number all day yesterday and today, no answer.      I'm in no way expecting to find my laptop, I know its a lost cause.  But is this really the case where cops come in, give you a slip of paper and act like they're working only to have you run in circles?  Why couldn't they issue a Report # on the spot so a file could be started?  Anyone else have similar incidents?      As a native SF, we've been calling it the city for decades.  Even our hoops team has a [sweatshirt](http://kazowie.com/wespreston/B-Day+%6010/Golden+State+Warriors+The+City+Pullover+Hoodie)   Even soda tasted better at the Japanese McD.  Better quality sugar, or cane.    I'm surprised your black buddies spider senses didn't tingle up and tell you to not even step foot inside the bar.  I know my friends would immediately say something. Sorry this happened   It was our first date, we were dancing at a concert in Prospect Park.  All night long we just grooved out, and at the end of the night a club promoter handed a flyer and told us to come to his party because he liked our dancing.    When I told him this was our first date, he said "you guys look like you've been together for awhile!"  I kinda already had the feeling she was "the one", but the club promoter sealed the deal.     Marijuana is not a drug. I used to suck dick for coke. Now that's an addiction. You ever suck some dick for marijuana?    why yes...yes i am   I was gonna go there with a rant similar to yours, but instead posted this link busting this kid out.  And you wonder why Reddit has gone to shit lately.     I posted on Reddit front page this link busting out David1337, and the reasons Reddit has gone to shit lately.        5 guys can suck it   My friends and I used to play these hypothetical question games all the time.  Here's one for you.  Would you take a sip of your dad's sperm for 2 million?     I'm waiting for some sick screen plays with James   Don't worry, don't trip, everything will be alright, Just clear your throat, and take a sip of that Sprite,  I dunno where I'm goin, but this I do know, You got some skills kid, now go and work on that flow       man grab a pen n paper, start jotting them down.  back in HS my friend's go into it, they sucked at first but they kept at it.  now some of em can go on spittin forever.  you have the vocab and cleverness    Impressive...you any good at free stylin?     what's considered a large bust?     It's not the name itself that's funny, but the background to it.   My buddy's name is Leon Leroy.  He's a white guy   Instead of boiling the tomatillos, I'd go for char/roast for the smokey flavor.  Rick Bayless has an awesome green tomatillo salsa recipe  	113
    I think you're quite adorable   OMG DESCENT! !!   In all actuality, most bars have these because the local bail offices will give them copious amounts for free. This is also true for matches. The bar I work at get's roughly 10k wristbands, in all sorts of colors, for free rather than the 32ish dollars it costs for a box of 1k wristbands.   Hey Anthony,  what would be your dream cast of members for the next band you create?    Futurama?   A testicle wrapped in a golf ball skin.  Probably a "soft feel" type golf ball rather than a "distance" type.

(Opinions on Obama and Syrian Refugees)   For a school project (iGCSE GP), I need to get a range of opinions.-so I thought Reddit would be a good place to come to.

Also feel free to add any information on the topic too. If you don't mind, I would appreciate of you stated your culture/home country since I need to show I have opinions from a variety of backgrounds.

Call the police is all I have to say. Good luck OP.   UPDATE:  OK guys. I checked out La Senza today and they didn't sell anything above D but a 32D seemed like a good fit. I'm guessing 32E will be perfect so thank you to anyone who suggested I try that size instead! :)  	9
    Who are these experts?  How did they get this information?      My 8 year old account was banned last year.   OP what nationality is she?  Curious because of the shape of her nose.    the problem with gfycat.com is it's not mobile-friendly, in other words, if you access reddit from your mobile, you can't load these images  the best gif viewer on mobile so far that works best with reddit is imgur     It seems you're a fucking cunt.  Or maybe you're just a troll      MA has had this requirement for a long time   1923 it wasn't called bluegrass, just "that old times music"   Awesome lineup   You mean UMass, right OP?  Not Amherst College   The dude drives a car, eats at McDonald's, drinks Starbucks coffee (at $4 a pop), has an iPhone and pays for cable.  Choices, man.  It's not about your wages, it's about what you spend your money on.   It depends on where you live.  You can often get all of that included if you live in Sunderland or Belchertown.  Apartments in Amherst and Northampton are much much more expensive and utilities are often NOT included   Here's mine about the Jewish student that was caught painting swastikas on her own door  http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/2wjf9p/jewish_student_caught_painting_swastikas_on_her/   Do you have a different link?

My wife and I own a house and some land in Amherst, MA.  We've lived here since the 1960s.  We love it.  It's racially diverse (I'm white an my wife is Korean), a great place to have a family and grow up (my kids stayed in Amherst and they have their own kids now).  I'm 63, I'll retire in a couple years.  My wife and I have talked about moving to someplace warmer because it's so frikking cold here in the winter.  This last winter was especially bad.  But all of our family are here and it would be a burden to them for us to move away, so I think we'll stay.  Besides, we have a huge house and lots of land.  My wife is an avid organic gardener and we have fruit trees, berry bushes and several gardens.  I'd hate to give that up.  I can't speak about small business ownership.  I work at a couple of the local hospitals which have their issues in management, but overall are excellent.  Like I said, I've owned property in Amherst since it was cheap.  It's very expensive now, but you can find more affordable real estate in Belchertown, which is not too far from here, or South Hadley which is a bit farther, but also a very nice place to live (my youngest daughter lives there with her girlfriend - yes it's gay friendly).  Hope it helps   OP do you have a link to the original movie?            http://www.darpa.mil/newsevents/releases/2014/02/09.aspx   Agreed.  Mike Marshall is as talented as Thile, but much more versatile, and his experience (and age) give him more breadth.  I vote for Marshall.   Mike Marshall      Wow why do you tolerate these returns?

You've never worked in food service, I take it?   Keep your hand off the instrument.  Relax your wrist.  Angle the pick to the side (not the point).  Start slowly and work up to a fast tempo over time using a metronome - quarter notes, 8th notes, 16th notes, 32nd notes, etc.   But if you've ever worked in food service, you know there is sexual harassment.

I hope the GOP and AIPAC supporters see this video.  Maybe once they understand that they are hated in Israel, they won't want to send my tax dollars there any more      Hardly crazy.  Chinese people have a different idea of what's important in life than Americans.  That's really all there is to it.         That was a little harsh. Why do I sense anger?  So you think morality is subjective and relative and that is why you acquiesce to the idea that systems of governance must aggress? Its a necessary evil for the greater good? And you really can't imagine another way? Is that your general position?          I don't have any apple products and never will.  I'm not registering for iTunes just to use this service.

That would be cool to juxtapose them together                  Something like guitar hero, but with a full band instead of one instrument, and not a contest, but a jam session.  It would be an online game where you could play music with people from all over the world.  You could pick your instrument and by practicing it, become more efficient and get invited to join better groups - like bands or orchestras or whatever.     Must be an old picture because CA doesn't have any water now            I like to make people healthy (I'm an ER doc) and in the evenings, I like to make music with my family and friends.

Pretty sure they are not photoshopped off.  The landscape looks asian...maybe Vietnam?      the boobs are photoshopped as you can see from the shadowing and distortion around the arms         1.  Get a good mandolin teacher  2.  Make sure he/she is a mandolin player, not a guitarist that can "pick a few tunes" - you want someone that plays and teaches mandolin  3.  Learn to read music.  Sure you can learn tab too, but if you're going to play with others, music is the best form to use  4.  Find a teacher that also leads a good mandolin group so you can learn to play the instrument, and play in a group setting   She's had extensive cosmetic surgeries   They were #3 in 2013  http://www.bostonglobe.com/lifestyle/food-dining/2013/09/10/campus-dining-big-industry-especially-umass-amherst/uaMpTMXSVy5Qh3euuv7mLL/story.html   That's Grover Norquist.

Go to "Plenty of Fish" do a search for anyone in Dalian, China.  Offer them $100 to find these Americans (I guarantee they are well known there).  Book a flight to Dalian (14 hours from JFK), kidnap the kid.  Fly home.   Nice try, Chinese Government!     	194

In your life and travels, what has been the most magnificent object you have held in your hands?         Explain to her that the majority of matter and energy in the universe has a tendency to slow down, and that she matters because she lives in a time and place of active complexity, that the life she is living is not a slowing down but a speeding up---technology, sciences, space exploration, human awareness---its all becoming more and more complex,  adding on to each other in a beautiful way, going in the opposite direction of 99.99% of everything else that exists.

 It depends. For instance, my hometown had its sewage treatment plant in the south part of town, and it stank to high heaven because nobody cared enough about odor abatement. When they switched to district representation, and the city commission had a rep from that part of town for the first time, it got cleaned up fairly quickly.  District representation makes some things better and some things worse. We'll have to see how the balance shakes out here.   Isn't that covered under step 4?   Do you have any duck food?   Thanks.   I didn't see that AMA. I'm not terribly surprised.    OC is correct that Phelps did a lot of worthy civil-rights work, and in his home town, Topeka KS, where I used to work, he had a lot of friends and loyalty among black leaders even after he went full-on evil.   Thanks, I hadn't thought of that.   Thanks! I'll give it a look.   Hi folks. I'm a grad student working on a project that involves downloading posts and comments from a couple of Reddit subs, and I'm a complete noob at Python and so on. I'm trying to self-teach, but it's slow going, and I need a boost.  So if anyone in Austin can meet me and show me how to do the stuff I need to do (or explain that it can't be done, though I'm confident it can) in PRAW and how to manage the output so it's in a form I can use, I'd be happy to pay for a lesson or two.  (My project isn't "about" scraping Reddit data, my adviser doesn't care how I get the stuff off the site, so this isn't a "do my homework for me" request.)  Thanks!   You left out "There are those who will say that" before that quote; the author is arguing *against* the sentiment you attribute to her.   I made my GF watch this one, because she had lost my car.  Kind of a long story, but I went out of town for a couple of weeks, and her car needed repairs so she used mine while it was in the shop, and when her car was ready she drove my car downtown to pick it up, intending to come back on the bus later to get my car, only she just plumb forgot, and didn't remember till days later. By that time it had been towed from the 2-hour lot, of course. She was appropriately apologetic and paid the fines, so no harm done.   In fact she enjoyed the movie, unexpectedly considering what a guy flick it is, and so did I. Though our fun was probably enhanced by the absurdity of the previous events.   I only went to that movie because they had a free showing as part of a radio promotion, but I liked it anyway.   The critics basically all have to see it, but the audiences are self-selected; they only go to a movie if they're confident it's their kind of thing. So more than half of moviegoers in general might think it's a bad movie, but they won't rate it online because they went to something else instead.   [True dat.](http://i.imgur.com/yGzIv4s.jpg)   You should read more closely. Leaving early would have cost *more*, presumably because of the penalty for changing the flight. In that situation, the way you cut your losses is you try to make something of it. Which he did. And things didn't improve.   "You just made my whole day."   You have no idea what attitude he went into SXSW with. It didn't help that the festival made it harder to preview the bands before showing up this year, but if he thought it was going to suck he'd have stayed home. He's that kind of guy.   He's written about the process in past years and has gotten a lot more out of it. 10 days working full time (because this is his job) should be plenty to find the interesting bands, and this year everyone was from LA instead all over. Now that the festival depends so heavily on corporate sponsors, they bring in more bands the corporations already like and fewer unknowns. It doesn't matter if ~2200 bands are in town if they're all the same thing.   I think it's important to have it during spring break, so the students who want to attend or volunteer can do so, and the ones who want to get out of town and avoid the madness can do that. But you're right that it's gotten too big and out of control (and money-hungry).            People in your actual life are like this, it just hasn't happened in front of you yet.   ([reference](http://weknowmemes.com/2013/07/fuck-these-6-fish-in-particular/))   Fuck These 39 Kangaroo Rats In Particular.   I saw one a few years ago on the Shoal Creek trail in Austin that paused for a second as it skittered across the path. Not easy to spot; it blended in pretty well.   What my last GF called "manly stench."   Looks as if the city considers Uber a limousine service, not a taxi service, since taxi services have tons of hoops to jump through that Uber likely hasn't dealt with. Per [this link](http://www.amlegal.com/nxt/gateway.dll/Texas/austin/title13transportationservices/chapter13-2groundtransportationpassenger?f=templates$fn=default.htm$3.0$vid=amlegal:austin_tx$anc=JD_13-2-191) via /u/glassuser below, limo services have to have a minimum $55 fare and 30-minute advance booking.   [Not to mention the book.](http://i.imgur.com/mPBP2ib.jpg)   [Someone make it happen.](http://urbanprankster.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/wanted.jpg)   You know what they say: If you run into an asshole, he's an asshole. If you run into assholes all day, you're the asshole.   Most of the bands here for the music portion only get to play one official set, but they're here to get noticed, so there's a secondary economy of bands playing gigs all over town at unofficial venues, including a lot that don't have live music otherwise. Just wander around central Austin and you'll hear a lot of them.  Several years ago I lived at the north end of West Campus and just walking up the street in the afternoon I could generally catch four or five bands.    My wife and I used to love going there and we always spent money. But the store started to change and going there stopped being fun.  Yeah, this. I moved nearby in 2007 and loved the place, but sometime around 2010 it was noticeably going downhill, and by the last time I was in there last year it was basically all Hello Kitty merchandise. It seemed like a bizarre trajectory.   I know all the letters, or at least 26 of them. Are there more?   The what now?   Toy Joy was already a shell of its former self before it moved. Last time I went in there it had basically turned into a Hello Kitty store; a lot of the cool stuff I went in there for was long gone.   It may have been inevitable, I don't know what was going on behind the scenes, but it had gradually been losing its mojo for some time.   You missed the part that most of that 2.5 hours isn't part of the calculation. The report doesn't care if you're driving in from Georgetown or Amarillo, only the stretches where traffic is consistently slower than it should be -- the roads in Austin metro -- are part of the calculation.    Not quite. They only count the congested parts of roads. The congestion index only accounts for the parts of roads between Waco and Austin that are actually slowed down by traffic. In the NYC area (and other big metros) there are longer stretches of slowed-down roads.   If you're happy with a short but slow commute, then you're happy because you live close to work, not because traffic is light. Because it isn't.   Um, because the library doesn't open until 7?   As I understand it, Austin wastes more time per mile of road. NYC's commutes cover longer distances.   The [methodology section](http://scorecard.inrix.com/scorecard/methodology.asp) says, if I'm reading it right, that they take the road lengths into account -- that is, NYC drivers sit in traffic longer, but that's partly because they drive farther on average. So, say, a theoretical 10-minute drive that takes 30 minutes is more congested than a 20-minute drive that takes 50 minutes, by that measure. Again, if I'm reading it right.   Politics, especially in Texas, is a full-contact sport. It ain't the garden club election.   That's not money from the university itself. It's money given by employees and their families out of their own pockets. When you donate to a candidate or a party organization you have to say where you work.      Such a little devil, that one.   Agree about Sprint. I love the unlimited-data plan, but lordy their coverage here sucks.   Suddenly everyone was dog tired.   Me: "Know what?"  Dad: "No, what?"  It seemed quite clever to my young self.   Interesting. There are lots of other factors too, such as that people will walk farther to get to faster transit, e.g. rail.   People generally will only walk 1/4 mile to get to a bus stop. Guad to Congress is about a quarter-mile. That means that if someone wants to get somewhere east of Congress, they may decide the added distance is not worth the effort.   Having the buses on Congress puts them closer to things people actually take the bus to get to. This will speed up traffic going *through* downtown, but trips going *to* downtown are another matter.   Not really a neighborhood intersection; it's a five-way with a lot of traffic, and discouraging cyclists from blowing through there is probably a worthwhile exercise.   Little Deli is a wonderful place, glad to see it's getting its due.   You're the one complaining that they dress ugly and using hostile language. Go take a chill pill.

Just keep telling yourself that if they had a choice they would dress to please you, if it makes you feel better.  	55
 Free access paper:  http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0120012      Link to paper: http://hmg.oxfordjournals.org/content/24/7/2035  Abstract:  Myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1), the most prevalent muscular dystrophy in adults, is characterized by progressive muscle wasting and multi-systemic complications. DM1 is the prototype for disorders caused by RNA toxicity. Currently, no therapies exist. Here, we identify that fibroblast growth factor-inducible 14 (Fn14), a member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor super-family, is induced in skeletal muscles and hearts of mouse models of RNA toxicity and in tissues from DM1 patients, and that its expression correlates with severity of muscle pathology. This is associated with downstream signaling through the NF-B pathways. In mice with RNA toxicity, genetic deletion of Fn14 results in reduced muscle pathology and better function. Importantly, blocking TWEAK/Fn14 signaling with an anti-TWEAK antibody likewise improves muscle histopathology and functional outcomes in affected mice. These results reveal new avenues for therapeutic development and provide proof of concept for a novel therapeutic target for which clinically available therapy exists to potentially treat muscular dystrophy in DM1.      Antibiotics can have similar negative effects on chloroplasts and plants. Source: http://www.publish.csiro.au/paper/FP03149.htm  It depends on the mechanism of how the antibiotic works, if it targets translation pathways like several antibiotics do then it most likely doesn't matter if the target is eukaryotic or prokaryotic as those mechanisms are largely conserved.     It's interesting that tetracycline (and neomycin in the linked study) causes weight gain, I was a bit surprised by that claim so looked to see if it was true - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15905446  It'd be interesting to know if the increase in mass is due to fat accumulation and what the meat quality is like. Tetracycline inhibits protein synthesis ( a lot more effectively in bacteria than mammalian cells) and so do aminoglycoside antibiotics like streptomycin and neomycin (by blocking calcium channels). Streptomycin blocks the signaling pathways that lead to muscle growth and also inhibits mitochondrial function preventing the adaptation to chronic exercise in muscle. That suggests that less muscle will be made due to less protein synthesis and perhaps more fat accumulation due to mitochondrial dysfunction.  I'd be surprised that using less energy to fight infection was the reason for the increase in weight but I might be underestimating how often livestock get infections - probably quite high with the battery farms and similar "maximize animal density type farms".   Link to paper http://www.sciencemag.org/content/early/2015/03/11/science.aaa2958  Abstract:  After central nervous system (CNS) injury, inhibitory factors in the lesion scar and poor axon growth potential prevent axon regeneration. Microtubule stabilization reduces scarring and promotes axon growth. However, the cellular mechanisms of this dual effect remain unclear. Here, delayed systemic administration of a blood-brain barrier permeable microtubule stabilizing drug, epothilone B (epoB), decreased scarring after rodent spinal cord injury (SCI) by abrogating polarization and directed migration of scar-forming fibroblasts. Conversely, epothilone B reactivated neuronal polarization by inducing concerted microtubule polymerization into the axon tip, which propelled axon growth through an inhibitory environment. Together, these drug elicited effects promoted axon regeneration and improved motor function after SCI. With recent clinical approval, epothilones hold promise for clinical use after CNS injury.       Link to the paper: http://www.sciencemag.org/content/347/6227/1265  Abstract:  Circadian clocks orchestrate periods of rest or activity and feeding or fasting over the course of a 24-hour day and maintain homeostasis. To assess whether a consolidated 24-hour cycle of feeding and fasting can sustain health, we explored the effect of time-restricted feeding (TRF; food access limited to daytime 12 hours every day) on neural, peripheral, and cardiovascular physiology in Drosophila melanogaster. We detected improved sleep, prevention of body weight gain, and deceleration of cardiac aging under TRF, even when caloric intake and activity were unchanged. We used temporal gene expression profiling and validation through classical genetics to identify the TCP-1 ring complex (TRiC) chaperonin, the mitochondrial electron transport chain complexes, and the circadian clock as pathways mediating the benefits of TRF.  	9
                                     It is so badly written with spelling mistakes, I think it is just someone's blog with a view on the satellite industry rather than trying to be anything.      The article/comment....  (It isn't that sort of website where traffic matters as there are no adverts)  ----------------------------   So, the SpaceX hype turned out to be just that. An altogether more prosaic investment was announced to fund core operations.   SpaceX, currently embroiled in a court case with its benefactor the US government which elected to give SpaceX no part of a recent $11bn launch order (http://spacenews.com/42882filing-suggests-jurisdictional-challenge-in-spacex-lawsuit-against-us ) and on the heels of a recently crashed launch, needed cash. This investment is about funding its core operations, not about initiating some fantasy global satellite constellation about which no mention is made.   Google (who made no comment) are named alongside Fidelity as investors, but no amount is given. So, it could be the Google Charitable Foundation, and it could be $1 for all we know. Fidelity invests for a living.   Also, in typically cryptic fashion, no terms are mentioned. Ordinary shares, convertible loans, preference shares, exploding warrants, covenants and targets ?   The uninformative Spacex website merely has the text below, making it clear that proceeds are to fund continued innovation in the areas of space transport, reusability, and satellite manufacturing i.e. the core business was running out of money, and no mention of fleets of satellites.   Space Exploration Technologies (SpaceX) has raised a billion dollars in a financing round with two new investors, Google and Fidelity. They join existing investors Founders Fund, Draper Fisher Jurvetson, Valor Equity Partners and Capricorn. Google and Fidelity will collectively own just under 10% of the company.   SpaceX designs, manufactures, and launches the worlds most advanced rockets and spacecraft. This funding will be used to support continued innovation in the areas of space transport, reusability, and satellite manufacturing.   Incredibly, newspspers of record like The Times reported last night the rumours, not the facts SpaceX is a private company and thus is subject to no stock market rules about truthful or complete press releases. Google made no announcement, suggesting nothing material has happened    it is terribly written.  However, it makes me think how much we really know and how much of it is a long term vision   Honestly, i would be interested. I picked it of an investment board regarding geostationary satellites.  So don't know how much of it is investors in denial.

Lets talk about costco!   Something like this would work for me  http://i.imgur.com/7I4OvJ7.jpg   Costco again proves that you can treat employees well and pay them a fair wage while remaining competitive.    Look into the history of costco management. They have very consistently and firmly stood by their employees. A few years ago they were ridiculed by their investors for basically treating their employees too well (too much pay, too many benefits, etc). The CEO basically told the investors that they were welcomed to sell off their stock if they have a problem with it, but that the company has consistently been a good investment because of the decisions they make to stand by their employees and that he has no intention of changing that.  I have a lot of admiration for costco as a company.  All hail Costco ~ company of common sense and eminent reign.   billionaire genius playboy   What are you talking about?  This is not a repost.                         Comments like this make scrolling through all the forced memes, low effort karma whoring, pun threads, and other cancer worthwhile.   All the talk of mass surveillance is very dangerous if it doesn't come with some hope of a solution because it grants more perceptual power to a system that already has a radical, extreme and destabalising amount of it. All that is necessary to control others is the projected perception of power. That's why we have worked hard to break that perception, for example in the race to spirit Edward Snowden to asylum vs. Washington DC's race to arrest him, we won, demonstrating that with a few good ideas and some determination it is possible to beat this power cluster in a well defined head on contest.Solutions are going to come form the demand that organisations, governments and individuals have for protection. Don't be dispirited; a lot of people are now working rapidly on tools and standards to counter the mass surveillance attack. There's a great flowering in that field.   It's frustrating, the internet has become such a creepy "you are the product" medium. The more of this I see, I start to feel like I don't want to be a part of it anymore.   This should be top comment.   The fundamental problem is the regulator and corporate influence on government.  We need a change that we can believe in.

 I live in Hershey, PA where the Penn State Hershey Medical Center is located and includes the Children's Hospital. Families from around the country that suffer from pediatric cancer come to the Children's Hospital for care. All the money that is raised from THON is given directly to the Four Diamonds Fund which is a charitable organization that helps families pay for the entire cost of their child's cancer treatment that isn't covered by insurance. That goes for ANY child with cancer at the Children's Hospital. They provide amazing support for the families and also donate to pediatric cancer research.   Since it started in 1973, THON has raised over $100 million for Four Diamonds. What these Penn State students do every year is amazing and so moving and the more attention THON and the Four Diamonds Fund get, the better!  If you're interested, here's the link to the THON and the Four Diamonds Fund websites where you can read up on what they do and even donate towards the total for THON 2015. FTK!!

So I don't think he was worried about Meechum ever being disloyal. During the all-nighter with Doug when Frank made the call to get Meechum's job back he knew Meechum was going to be indebted to him indefinitely. It was insurance essentially: *"It requires very little of me and will mean the world to him. It's a very inexpensive investment."*  Maybe Meechum was waiting at the top of the stairs at the station or otherwise not around to see what happened. He was never around in the same room as Frank and Zoe during their other meetings. He was probably just told to wait in the car outside the Metro stop. I think he's clever enough to have pieced together what happened but not stupid enough to express his thoughts. He knows Frank is dangerous.   Just my thoughts, but that's how I interpreted it.          But why do specific nations have to play against each other in order for it to be a "world" championship?

Its the way i do currently on Firefox when i need to add some emoji.    and paste as if they were regular text which is a shame. Another option is to not use these and include a web font   ah i dont quite understand, maybe im wrong here, but its really easy to copy-paste emoji's from http://getemoji.com/   Just select and copy! :)  Font support is good, but colors are still an issue. Since this seems like it has SVG support, it can work quite well i guess.  Third option is actually what i felt would be good, cross platform OS based or software based support.   Since Firefox doesn't have a way to input emojis directly into text fields, i felt this could do very well for those who want emoji inputs.      im not sure of the emoji one thing - recently stumbled across it.   But if its not supported then fall back to ":smile:" for  Thing is if this is implemented at an OS font or so, end users don't have to go searching for fonts etc.   i see a lot of emoji hate, but its much better to have something than those black boxes everywhere.   ah i guess i saw an SVG implementation on their github.   Also since this can be used as a standard cross-platform Emoji Support since its open-source(CC    MIT license),based on Unicode, and thus help in correct rendering of Emoji's.   Good for the users i guess :)      This will actually be a boost to both parties.   Lots of users can get around internet censorship with Tor quite easily.   Use the Tor Browser Bundle - you get everything of Tor, Firefox and free access   May this come super soon! _/\_   What Kind Of Sorcery Is This :O    re you're not running into an unintended bug? I vaguely recall seeing that they've been working on one word searches in Windows lately, so maybe I'm wrong.. (I'm on Linux right now)   ah im kinda having this issue, on the word - help   Rest all words work fine :|   oh okay :)   https://support.google.com/plus/answer/1216376?hl=en - Supports firefox   ah this? https://www.google.com/tools/dlpage/hangoutplugin   the story is underwraps so far.   In a interview "He(lead actor) said that the movie is about modeling industry when a model enters the field not by his own wish, but on compulsion."    According to rumours(NOT Confirmed) - "it revolves around five persons, a model (Amy Jackson) a doctor(Upen Patel) and three other people who get affected by a poisonous chemical. Reports add Chiyaan(Vikram) will sport a look which will depict a person with his face affected by such chemical."    Its a teaser, so the plot is still off. As for the lead actor, he's versatile and professional. An old film of his - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zRVTV1Wy8E     yes,   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_(film)          i tried the same slowest was around 30fps but it did hit 60fps at some points. But was constantly shifting between 38-50fps  Edit - Fedora 20, nvidia gt525M   Score: 4693 Total CPU Time: 38.79s, Total Lag: 161ms      ah yes! didn't elaborate properly! was too excited xD      they're just trying to keep the same design language across all their products   yes, i use the beat version v-33.   but the general google search is still the same :(   The news.google.com site started appearing in cards format on Firefox android  edit - http://imgur.com/3gihk5N   i just noticed the news.google.com site displays in the cards format on Firefox for Android!  edit - http://imgur.com/3gihk5N   Hopefully this should help you out too http://test_subject3336.wordpress.com/2013/09/22/linux-a-newbie-desktop-users-guide/   Ah okay, thanks for the info :)    Nightingale ?    try looking for a proprietary driver, if the open sourced one is at fault.  http://wireless.kernel.org/en/users/Drivers/b43 http://www.broadcom.com/support/802.11/linux_sta.php  One of these should help your situation :)  Edit:- i searched more through the interwebs: Enable RPM Fusion repo, or install them if you havn't Try doing a "yum install kmod-wl"      Try LiLi. Worked best in my experience http://www.linuxliveusb.com/   im not sure, might be a stupid guess too, but if your network card has a proprietary driver you could try install that and see if your thing works.  Check in windows or so to know your manufacturer    Also you could try disabling IPv6 support and see if you find some luck    Edit: Try ifup and ifdown to switch individual cards.   lspci can list out all the detected cards etc.   i really wish the variable stroke path width comes in fast to Inkscape.  It's of real and great importance to people who draw and illustrate on the computer   whats you said is true too, since people use their mobile devices a lot to type online, the emoji habit will also show up in text fields.   ah, i guess, in your case the system is missing the Segoe UI font or some other emoji color/noncolor supported font; which is why you're seeing boxes      :) you're welcome   i think this might be website enabled - http://www.fileformat.info/info/emoji/browsertest.htm    Still black and white; colored ones are images.   Why didnt emoji's get made in SVG?  EDIT: Also https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emoji  Edit 2: I think its because you are on Windows and have a color emoji support font installed on the system, My Linux system still shows b w :/   twitter did mention on a tweet long back that they started supporting color emoji's   that write up is just brilliant! hahaha xD   Firefox's edge is with the add-ons it has, thats one thing millions of users love. But yes e10s is highly needed to have that edge over chrome again.    Sometimes i feel e10s should have been a much higher priority in the past itself. FF wouldn't have lost out a good amount of users to chrome. Also risking the add-ons will be a blow to the already using FF users. I think with proper co-ordination and fast paced interaction within the Firefox community can make both e10s and add-on compatibility a great success.    http://arewee10syet.com/ -- the working add-on list shows good promise, even though there are lots of buggy ones and non tested ones too.   my dog starts barking loud! its like he's yelling around im hungry im hungry!    get the spice fire one - has an additional camera, and feels better from the youtube reviews too   ah yes, and once the update comes through, same issue.   Tried new profiles and reset.   my goto method on linux was disable the e10s autostart on launch thing in about:config and delete the updates folder and relaunch. Somehow it used to update.    Now it doesnt though :(   so it wasnt just me on linux O_O      Im sorry to hear that you're having troubles with Firefox.   I've been using firefox since it's version 1.0+ days.    My best guess is that you try out to get the latest stable version. Incase you've had it installed, try a browser reset or start a fresh profile.    https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/reset-firefox-easily-fix-most-problems  https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/profile-manager-create-and-remove-firefox-profiles   krita is mainly meant for the artists, GIMP was like the OSS response to photoshop.    Driver 2   i use both gimp and inkscape alternatively as a combo :)   the ones ive mentioned are mostly GNU GPL licensed and FOSS   http://test_subject3336.wordpress.com/2013/09/22/linux-a-newbie-desktop-users-guide/   Firefox, GIMP, Inkscape, Blender, Fedora Linux, Ubuntu Linux, Audacity, Krita, Birdie, Pidgin IM, Audacious, FBReader,  VLC    Edit -  forgot Libreoffice   could you try some other browser and see something similar is happening or not?   it could also be your OS downloading updates in the backgroud.    in case its on mobile, you can restrict background data usage on android in Data usage settings.    	113
 "Destitute Tier" haha   He doesn't really do a lot of fast action stuff except for the small amount of fighting at the end (that he doesn't do very well in). I'm sure you can get a clean, smooth picture but I'm most worried about the lag making it impossible to play shooters or faster paced games. Thanks anyways though.    My god look at that tiny HUD size.   How playable is it? Is there any lag/is it manageable?    What is that spectrometer at the top?   Oh my god, those visually similar images....   Her facial proportions are a little off and frankly a little off-putting to look at (pic 7). I've seen a lot of Asian women and they don't look like this.    Does Tepper really need a new building? How about renovating something else first, say, Wean?          How do you get Samurize to work? Are you still on XP?   You have to install all available updates first before it shows up in the store.    Just try not using your laptop for a while and see if you can live without it. Only you can tell whether it will be a viable replacement for you.    No.   I think it's time to look into the pros and cons of using each product in real life rather than just the pros and cons of the computers themselves. If you're gonna be bringing it to class, the Alienware is going to be WAY too huge. I'd go with the blade. In my experience with college, portability and battery life are just SO incredibly important. If you do get the Alienware I would look into also getting a companion tablet or light netbook for you to bring to class with the money you save. They're both great computers that serve slightly different purposes (powerful all around computer vs. desktop replacement). Make your call while considering your lifestyle (do you plan on sitting in your room or going to the library to do work, lan parties with friends, etc.) and how you plan on using your computer (take it to class or leave it in your room).   Also, technically it's not their first PC, as they have the Razer Blade Pro that was released a few years ago.    Even a $30 is WAY too much to spend on a screen protector. Just get a $5 to $10 one if one at all. I don't have a screen protector on my RT and it's just fine. My type cover protects it while in my bag.      Future economist right here.     Could be a one?   Let's blatantly overgeneralize an entire subset of people, that'll go over well.    It's a sorority hand sign. Forget which one in particular.   The Blade Pro is an outdated system by now. The new Razer Blade is the one you want to get. Switchblade is an old gimmicky system that most games don't support and is a feature I'd pay to get RID of, not to have. There's a reason they haven't updated the Pro/added Switchblade to the new Razer Blade.          I also have a stand-alone mic, not in the Picture. One of those Yeti microphones.    I do have Razer Surround, it sounds great.    I have it dual-booted to Ubuntu, I just need Windows for gaming.    This keyboard is AMAZING, much better than any membrane or chiclet keyboard in my opinion. The only downside is it's VERY loud, really clacky especially if you type fast (of courss, this could be seen as an upside to most people). If you have roommates or if you think you'll be bothered by the sound I'd recommend asking for the Steath version which uses different switches to be quieter. Personally, it doesn't bother me or my roommate and I kinda like the sound it makes.   Not sure? It's just a background I found when browsing google images. Link the the wallpaper has been provided on this thread already.    Yes, I have a pair of Audio Technica ATH-M50s. I am interested in getting a pair of actual gaming headphones, though. The Razer Kraken 7.1 looks really nice at a reasonable price.    It's a Cooler Master Notepal U2 Laptop Cooling Pad, found [here](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16834997730).    Yes, I LOVE this keyboard, I had the 2012 model before and just recently upgraded to this one (2013) with the Cherry MX Blues. It is very noisy, and I do have one roommate. Fortunately, he doesn't seem to mind it unless he's trying to sleep and I'm still up typing something. I guess it just depends on who you have as a roommate.    I made the Rainmeter skin myself, I will be posting it on /r/Rainmeter soon. Look for it there!   I do use my laptop screen frequently, but I would be interested in getting a stand to slide my keyboard under when I'm not using it. Thanks for the idea!   It's a skin I made myself actually. I am thinking of posting it onto /r/Rainmeter soon. Look for it there!   I prefer it for sure. It kinda braces your hand and wrist and allows for finer mouse movements.   I'm not really sure? It's been a long time since I've had it installed, so I don't really remember.    I am studying hard; I go to one of the country's best Computer Science schools. This is just a small hobby of mine, I don't intend to build some insane computer-built-into-desk-with-liquid-cooling-and-leds system. Just some suggestions on computer placement or small changes or some stuff that I haven't thought about would be nice.    Yeah, I re-installed windows and didn't install the beats audio drivers after. Honestly, beats doesn't sound all that bad on my laptop; I even think it makes the sound from the built-in speakers sound better. You can disable the equalizer and tweak the bass and stuff so it doesn't sound bad.   But yes I do have it completely uninstalled and it sounds pretty much the same.    It's windows 8 with the programs Rainmeter and Stardock Objectdock. Objectdock gives me that menu on the left and Rainmeter gives me the bar on top and right side and the date and time in the middle.   I actually have my laptop dual-booted for Ubuntu, which I prefer over Windows 8 for web browsing and stuff like that. When I want to game I switch over to Windows.    It uses a lot less bandwidth than Skype does, so in that sense it's better. Whether you like the sound quality is up to personal preference; Razer Comms tries to make your voice stand out above in-game audio but it can make it sound a little harsh and unnatural in my opinion. Just try it out and see what you think!   [Here](http://wlppr.com/wallpapers/2010/06/14/Slides_of_light.2880x1800.jpg) you go!   I would totally get a different desk if I could, but as this one came with the dorm I would rather stick with it. Plus I wouldn't have a way of keeping the desk for next year. For now, this is what I have.    HP Envy 14 Beats Edition. Not exactly the best laptop, it's about 2 years old. Definitely getting a new one soon.       Is it just me or does this cat look a little like Wall-E?   I see what you did there.    This article talks about having the battery *constantly* at 100%. As long as you let the battery go through charge cycles decently regularly (let the battery discharge to maybe 20% at least once a month) you shouldn't have an issue with reduced battery life.   	47

 When applying to the bar, they'll probably want to know. If you were a 0L applying to law schools, you'd probably have to disclose it then. I can't imagine why you'd have to disclose it to your school as a current student. (I also can't imagine how disclosing it to your school would hurt you in any way if you felt compelled to tell them.)   Also, nearly every law school offers its students access to CALI lessons and nearly every law student stops looking at them after 1L year. I think that's a mistake. CALI lessons can be valuable for hints at the sort of things professors in that area of law might test.   This all depends on what your prof covered/emphasized, obviously. If you had my professor, beyond Chevron/Skidmore/Auer, you'd need to be prepared for questions about the type of evidence permitted in adjudications (hearsay is often okay, ex parte is not, etc.), when can agency heads be removed (Myers, Humphrey's Executor, Wiener), when is formal rulemaking required, issues of delegation, what information must be given as part of rule making (underlying data, concise general statement of basis and purpose, etc.),  when is ex-parte communication accepted or at least non-fatal in rulemaking, issues of reviewability (standing, ripeness, mootness, exhaustion, preclusion, review of agency inaction), due process concerns (Goldberg, Matthews v. Eldridge, where property interests come from, etc.), definitions of substantial evidence, separation of powers, ... These were the key concepts I focused on.   The FDA is not looking at coffee or cola, but at other products.   It is inaccurate to say that the FDA intends to potentially regulate caffeine. Caffeine is already regulated. The FDA is looking into potentially enforcing its existing powers that it has, to date, not exercised much towards caffeinated products.  Food, drugs, medical devices, cosmetics, and food additives are all regulated under the federal Food, Drugs, and Cosmetics Act (FCDA). An important aspect of the FDCA is classifications. Food, drugs, cosmetics, medical devices, food additives, color additives, etc., all are definitional categories with different types and burdens of regulations. Often, the classification is based on the intended use of a substance or item, and caffeine is no different.  Caffeine is regulated based on its intended use. Caffeine in food is not a dietary supplement, it is a food additive and one must show that it is safe. Caffeine in pill form is a drug. Certain products containing caffeine are dietary supplements which is a category of food with special requirements.  When the FDA is speaking about increasing its oversight of caffeine in food products, it's not talking about going after coffee. Caffeine is a natural, non-added constituent in coffee. The same can't be said of many of the other products caffeine has been added to. The FDA is concerned about the use of caffeine as a food additive as well as the blurring distinction between foods and dietary supplements.  Foods are consumed primarily for its taste, aroma, or nutritive value. Food additives are defined in FDCA 201(s) as "any substance the intended use of which results or may reasonably be expected to result, directly or indirectly, in its becoming a component or otherwise affecting the characteristics of any food [omitting the subsequent exceptions]."  Food additives must be Generally Recognized As Safe (GRAS). There is no premarket approval process before an item can be sold, nor is there a definitive FDA-issued list of everything that is GRAS, instead, manufactures have the option of notifying the FDA of their belief something is GRAS before marketing or they can just put it on the market and wait to see if the FDA objects.   The key element is that GRASness is not inherent in the ingredient, but in the intended use. The FDA recognized caffeine as GRAS in soft drinks, but that determination only applies to soft drinks. All other food products beyond soft drinks that include caffeine have not received prior sanction from the FDA, merely a history of inaction which can change at any time. The FDA would not be adding a new regulation, merely choosing to exercise its existing authorities to declare that an additive (caffeine) is not GRAS in a certain use or form.  Dietary supplements are defined by FDCA 201(ff) as products which contain a vitamin, mineral, herb or other botanical, amino acid, a dietary substance to supplement the total dietary intake, etc. and are not represented for use as a conventional food or as a sole item of a meal or the diet. One problem the FDA has with current dietary supplements is that they are being sold in a way that does not distinguish them from conventional foods. (See http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2011-09-09/health/ct-nw-supplements-quiz-20110909_1_dietary-supplements-energy-drinks-american-herbal-products-association which discusses a food energy drink and a dietary supplement being sold in the same cooler.) Foods have certain safety requirements that dietary supplements do not. Their ingredients are not reviewed for safety in the way that ingredients are for food, or for safety and efficacy the way drugs are reviewed.  The TL;DR version of all is (1) The FDA isn't coming for your coffee; (2) the FDA is not creating new regulatory requirements; and (3) the FDA is considering enforcing its existing authority because of safety concerns and because the public might be mislead into thinking products have been evaluated for safety in a way they actually have not.   There is a bus between Brattleboro and Bennington: http://www.moover.com/routes-timetables/bennington   When Democrats accused the Bush Administration of engaging in torture, illegal warrantless wiretapping, going to war under false pretenses, and other assorted high crimes and misdemeanors, we were accused of "Bush derangement syndrome."  The feigned outrage of Benghazi is little different from Whitewater (which despite actually stumbling across Monica Lewinsky during its fishing expedition, never found any wrongdoing by the Clintons related to the stated purpose of the investigation) or from those who accused the Clintons of murdering Vince Foster. Say what you will about Democrats, but at least we accuse Republicans of shit they've actually done.   AFAIK, without a car, not really. There's no direct bus from Boston or from Hanover, you'd have to take a bus from Hanover to Boston, from Boston to Albany, and then from Albany to Rutland.  Do you have a license? If so, find out if you can rent a car from Rent a Wrecksome locations have lower age requirements than Hertz, Avis, National, etc.   I'm not a Prenda fan and I hate being Mr. No. Fun, but while I enjoyed the Star Trek references in Judge Wright's opinion, I find myself agreeing with Mr. Steele that they seem inappropriate in a serious judicial order. It's one thing to slyly slip one or two in, or to have fun in an opinion about a talking cat (if you haven't read it, google Blackie the Talking Cat), and another thing entirely to include many unrelated pop culture references in a serious sanction order accusing people of misconduct. (See pg. 22 of the Federal Judicial Center's Judicial Writing Manual. http://www.fjc.gov/public/pdf.nsf/lookup/JudicialWritingManual.pdf/$file/JudicialWritingManual.pdf)    While the common law in the US has generally treated pets as property for which one can receive monetary compensation for things like vet bills or the value of the pet (not encompassing any damages for the emotional attachment and the likejust the replacement cost), this is slowly changing in some US jurisdictions. Courts in California, Florida, Washington, and Louisiana have allowed mental suffering damages related to a wrongful death or injury of a pet, for example.  Whatever source you find for UK tort law, make sure that you check to see if there are new developments in the field.   Every legal group constantly holds its views out as law whether it's the liberal ACLU or conservative ACLJ. Every conservative talking head on TV arguing that the Affordable Care Act's individual mandate was clearly unconstitutional (while ignoring that it was originally the idea of the ultra-conservative Heritage Foundation and part of the GOP's own healthcare plan in 1993, before being adopted by Mitt Romney in Massachusetts) ignored the broad language of 1942's Wickard v. Filburn. That the Court eventually went along with a narrowing of Wickard doesn't mean that a metric buttload of people weren't making broad proclamations that what they wanted the law to be was what the law was, even when precedent wasn't on their side.  Every legal advocacy group does it, and it's not a bad thing, it's how the law gets moved.   Sometimes the Supreme Court changes its mind, and it doesn't do so unless there is a case before them where at the District Court and Circuit Court of Appeals levels, lawyers argued that what is legal differed from that the Supreme Court previously said was legal. In fact, since the Court rarely takes appeals where there isn't a circuit split, with some Circuit Courts of Appeals going one way and others going the other, it usually involves many lawyers in many courts challenging what the Supreme Court has previously ruled.  An ACLU lawyer might have a broader view of rights, a prosecutor might have a narrower view of rights, and on any given day, either one may be right.   Law can be hard. If it was easy, there wouldn't be smart, hardworking lawyers on both sides of an issue arguing before a learned district court judge, appointed by the President and confirmed by Congress, who might decide a question of law one way, be reversed 6-5 by the Circuit Court of Appeals, and then be reversed back 5-4 by the Supreme Court.  Moreover, the law can change. What you know to be the law today might not be the law tomorrow. Administrative law is a good example of how the Supreme Court can be a bit wobbly on issues. Read (if you dare) about Chevron, Auer, Skidmore, Chirstensen v. Harris County, and the latest decision, Decker v. Northwest Environmental Defense Center, and how questions of deference versus respect have moved back and forth. Each decision (well, not Decker, that maintained the status quo more or less) overnight changed the way admin law was practiced. Hell, Justice Scalia wrote the majority opinion in Auer for a unanimous Court in 1997 and a few months ago, wrote a scathing attack on the reasoning of Auer, writing "Our cases have not put forward a persuasive justification for Auer deference," etc., making no mention of the fact that HE WROTE THE BLOODY DECISION! Sorry. Back now.   The case law on online student speech is incredibly muddled. In 2010, two en banc panels of the Third Circuit each heard a case involving students creating a spoof MySpace account of their principal with rather similar facts involved, and on the same day, the two panels handed down decisions with opposite conclusions of law. (It was Layshock v. Hermitage Sch. Dist. and J.S. ex. rel. Snyder v. Blue Mountain Sch. Dist.) It was cleared up a year or so later though a rehearing, but it goes to show how unsettled this area of law is.  The Pennsylvania Supreme Court held that speech aimed at a school or its personnel that is brought onto the school campus will be treated as in-school speech. (J.S. ex. rel. H.S. v. Bethlehem Area Sch. Dist.)  The Second Circuit, in two cases, applied a very broad view of school regulation of students' online speech. The Second Circuit's view is that speech likely to come to the attention of the school and cause a material or substantial disruption can be punished, seemingly without anything in the way of a limiting principle. (Wisniewski v. Bd. of Ed. and Doniger v. Niehoff.)  Since it's late and I need to sleep, I'll stop here and just sum up by saying administrators can pretty much do what they want right now. So long as they don't overstep the regulation and punishment that would be permitted for in-school speech, the law is unsettled to the point that being deemed to have qualified immunity is fairly certain should a suit arise. It would be very hard to hold them personally liable for violating a student's online free speech rights.   How long do you have before your paper is due? If you have a bit of time, you may want to try getting in touch with the Department of Justice itself and ask if an attorney would be willing to give you their view of the CFAA. (Hint: it's broad. One of their computer crimes attorneys told me a few years ago that he believed using an open wifi without permission may be a CFAA violation, analogizing to walking into a neighbor's home just because the door was left unlocked or open. And please, no downvotes for that, it's not MY view, I vehemently argued against this interpretation.)   Goss seems more relevant than morse. One is entitled to due process before suspension or expulsion, but the due process required is quite minimal.  The granddaddy of student rights cases was Tinker v. Des Moines, standing for the principal that student rights don't end at the schoolhouse gate and that wearing black arm bands in protest of the Vietnam War was protected symbolic speech so long as it does not result in a substantial/material disruption of the school environment.  Since others have brought up the free speech cases, I'll quickly run through the holdings, but I don't think believe they relate to the OP's question. Bethel excluded sexually explicit speech from protection in the schoolhouse context (one could phrase it as the Court deciding sexually explicit speech is inherently disruptive), Hazelwood was about speech in the context of school-controlled forums such as a school newspaper, school events, other publications, etc., and Morse was the court carving a special exception out to allow schools to engage in limited viewpoint discrimination when it comes to speech seen as promoting illicit drug use.  The better cases are Goss, TLO v. NJ, etc.   It's been codifiedthe First Amendment. It seems that you are asking for what it will take to codify it further?  You seem to be using precedent and codification interchangeably, and the two are not synonymous. Precedents are case law, they're judicial interpretations of statutes and the constitution. Codification is statutes, the Constitution, etc. (I say this not to be a dick or be pedantic, but because I'm not really sure what you are looking for.)  What would it take to further clarify the First Amendment? An additional amendment, which requires a 2/3rd vote in the House and Senate and ratification by 3/4ths of states, or 2/3rds of states to demand a Constitutional Convention, Congress to set the agenda of the Convention (although whether Congress can limit the agenda is disputed by various scholars), the Convention to propose amendments, and 3/4ths of states to ratify them.   As an American lawyer, I can't help you much. I know next to nothing about Canadian law, but the best argument I can see for a standard labor law is easing the regulatory burden of businesses. A national company spread across Canada may find itself subject to a range of labor laws, some of which may be conflicting and which may inhibit growth, cost money in software and HR, etc. Federal preemption can ease these burdens. (The counterargument is that preemption can be anti-democratic, because in the US, at least, states are often more responsive to citizen pressure and initiatives than the federal government, and allowing federal preemption in an area reduces the target of special interests to one political arena, whereas otherwise, they'd have to split their time and resources among the provincial governments.)   Ultra vires? Really? Grade 12? :P   Wow. Compared to other ex-Presidents this long after their presidency, Clinton looks remarkably young and healthy. His diet and exercise regimen have worked wonders.   I have no idea what the research methods or accuracy of the methods are, but this does not seem like a positive commentary on the public's view of the judiciary.      In some jurisdictions, yes, and that's certainly the common-law definition. In many jurisdictions however, by statute, the definition of criminal assault encompasses battery.  In Maryland, for example, assault, battery or a combination of the two is charged as assault. There is no longer a separate criminal charge for battery.   No need to "guess". Any intentional unwanted physical contact with another person is assault.   An administrative law essay question (55 minutes of the 4 hour exam) was based on NASCAR.   Have you stayed in touch with any of your past patients (or have they stayed in touch with you by sending the occasional thank you note or Christmas letter-sort of update)?   For federal law enforcement officers under the Executive Branch (which includes the Secret Service, FBI, US Marshals, US Park Police, Park Rangers, Pentagon Police, Federal Protective Service officers, DEA agents, ATF agents, etc.), 5 C.F.R. Part 2635 applies. It's not a police-specific statute, it applies to all employees of the Executive Branch. Gifts can be accepted under certain circumstances, and it may well not have applied to what OP described had a federal agent been involved instead of the local cop, but on the other hand, US Office of Govt. Ethics says, "Even if a gift is from a person or organization that has no official dealings with the employees agency, accepting a gift offered because of the employees official position may create an appearance of using public office for private gain." Changing the hypothetical from cop asking for free admission to cop getting free admission by flashing badge still creates an appearance of use of public position for private gain.  On the state law side, many jurisdiction's ethics rules are aimed towards preventing corruption in govt. contracting or in legislating, but some of the state laws in this matrix can apply to police officers: http://www.ncsl.org/legislatures-elections/ethicshome/50-state-table-gift-laws.aspx   It isn't always perfectly legal. Depends on the jurisdiction. Moreover, there's a big difference between accepting a gift and using your position of public authority and public trust to *ask* for a gift.   Wow. That's very unethical and in many places, criminal. If this happens again, you may want to ask your manager if he wants to contact internal affairs.   Yikes. One more instance of someone violently attacking a retail worker and not getting the cops called. :/ Perhaps pressure should be brought to bear on large corporations to treat physical abuse the way they do shoplifters?   Unfortunately, I can't a streaming version of it, but if you like this song, the Pyrates Royale, a Maryland pirate/nautical-themed band, do a cover that I think is better than the original. It's on their latest album "Keep Calm and Seek Revenge." http://www.pyrates.com/recordings/   In 2010, a Lebanese army sniper shot and killed an IDF Lt. Colonel and wounded another IDF soldier as an IDF team tried to cut a tree on Israel's side of the border. The UN Interim Force was informed of this work beforehand, and confirmed that the IDF soldiers did not cross the border and that Lebanon had no cause to fire on the soldiers.  Nevertheless, Egypt, Iran, Morocco, Jordan, and Syria all blamed Israel for the incident.   Britain and France told the US about it first. Israel was the third country to claim there were chemical weapons used in Syria, but given the anti-Israel conspiracy nuts, this has been lost on many.   I thought cats in boxes were both dead and alive?   Was the district's legal counsel not consulted or was s/he unaware of the concept of intentional infliction of emotional distress, the concept of post traumatic stress syndrome, and the number of digits that could be in a check to any teacher in that room who decides to sue?

If it was the CEO and not two interns, I'd watch.   I haven't made them in quite some time, but they always came out well (and I'm NOT a particularly experienced baker). A pretty fool-proof recipe. :-)   I've used this recipe..... http://robbiehaf.com/Recipes/A/69.htm   If by stole you mean paid for, then sure.  Apple paid Xerox a million dollars worth of pre-IPO stock in exchange for access to Xerox PARC's facility and use of its technology.   Law firm. When you graduate, a law firm might hire you. Professor won't.   I believe Massachusetts was the last state to require every thing be labeled on merchandise, although there may be local city or county ordinances with such a requirement. MA eliminated that law at the beginning of this year.  I am curious if the sticker law applied to liquidations....   1993Islamic fundamentalists park Ryder rental truck bomb in World Trade Center parking garage trying to destroy the complex.  1995Tim McVay parks Ryder rental truck bomb in front of Murrah federal building and destroys it.

Federal law does not set alcohol prices.   *nods* Certainly seems questionable. If the worker has a medical condition leading to the flatulence, it should lead to an interactive dialogue between the employee and the SSA, not a reprimand.   I'm genuinely not sure if the flatulence disgusts you or the attempt to write him up for it disgusts you.   Guess it wasn't as bad as the Social Security Administration's employee whose chronic flatulence made national news when they tried writing him up for it: http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/fed-agency-retracts-official-reprimand-flatulence-article-1.1238760   That's...not true. The articles you linked to say that based on his stature as a hero, trying Rommel before the People's Court would have been very damaging to the military's morale. To avoid damaging morale, Hitler gave Rommel the option of suicide in exchange for his family's suicide, and gave the honorary funeral, official cause of death wartime injuries, etc. to maintain the fiction.  It had nothing to do with Hitler liking him as a general.      "Getting to Yes" by Roger Fisher and William Ury is one of the classics... I'd start there.  For a more anecdotal book, with less of an overarching method, I like Herb Cohen's "You Can Negotiate Anything: The World's Best Negotiator Tells You How To Get What You Want."   It's assault. It merits investigation by law enforcement and if it occurred within the relevant statute of limitations, it merits criminal prosecution.   It's been done. http://cbsfresh1025.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/spiderman-window-washer.jpg         It's illegal to make servers pay for dine and dashers.

Thanks! :-)   How?   If the weather is nice next weekend, go to the Cherry Blossom festival. One of my favorite local performers, Margot Macdonald, is performing on Sunday the 7th. Oh, and the parade is on the 13th and the food afterwards is really good.   Back in the late '80s or early '90s, I remember my parents having to return 2 or 3 defective microwaves they just purchased. In frustration, they took a bag of potatoes to the store (I think it was Sears?), exchanged the defective microwave, and tested the replacement right then and there in the store. I think we still went through several more before getting a working model.   Who knows-it's possible they might never. But if they do and you didn't disclose it, you are well and truly screwed. Disclosing fully is the best policy (and the ethically appropriate one).    The Maryland Bar requires disclosing suspensions and expulsions going back to middle school, which was irksome because I received 1 day of "in-house suspension" for fighting in 6th grade and had to disclose it. (Before school started, while all the teachers were on the 2nd floor in a staff meeting, I was randomly attacked from behind by a kid with issues who started choking me. I defended myself, we wrestled, and someone went and got a teacher who broke it up. Even though the kid, to his credit I suppose, admitted he randomly attacked me, because we both fought, we both got 1 day of inhouse suspension.)  In my mandatory meeting with a member of the character and fitness committee (not because of my disclosure-everyone meets with a member of the committee), she said the committee laughed about this incident.  While your fake ID incident is not likely to amuse (or thrill) law school admission committees, I don't think they are likely to penalize you for it, either.   You. I like you.   (Note that I do NOT suggest actually attempting this.)   The definition of an electronic signature under the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act passed in most states is even more fun! "Electronic signature" means an electronic sound, symbol, or process attached to or logically associated with a record and executed or adopted by a person with the intent to sign the record." (quoting Maryland's version of the Act) If affixed to a record with the intent to sign the record, one could theoretically have a clip from a Britney Spears song be their signature.   This was actually the subject of a lawsuit. http://www.lettersofnote.com/2012/03/butt-head-astronomer.html   I'm a big fan of Elaine Corn's "Now You're Cooking: Everything a Beginner Needs to Know to Start Cooking Today." http://www.amazon.com/Now-Youre-Cooking-Everything-Beginner/dp/1883791057/ Very clear descriptions of common recipe terms, clear recipes, it's a wonderful starter book.            Why would the process suffer merely by being more broadly observed?   Audio and transcripts aren't the same as video. The law isn't a popularity contest, but we do gain by letting the public view the process-transparency begets legitimacy. It could move us beyond thinking of the Court as a 5-4 binary block and highlight the cases when Ginsburg and Scalia are both dissenting, or when the Court is unanimous.  Members of the Court claim that video would lead to 5 second soundbytes, as if Court coverage is not already 5 second soundbytes-they're just being read by anchors instead of the real thing. Video would at least give the possibility of more people getting the full story through a CSPAN-type channel.   This isn't a new thing, it's common practice for important oral arguments as the NYT article reports, and it's common for Congressional hearings too.  Live broadcasting oral arguments on TV wouldn't completely eliminate folks being paid to stand in line, but it would help ensure that a full understanding of the workings of one of the three branches of government isn't limited to those who can afford to spend $50 an hour starting four days prior to arguments.

There are plenty of pieces of history that are in private hands. Are you proposing seizing them as well?   For those unfamiliar with the Narwhal Bacon, see here: http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/the-narwhal-bacons-at-midnight   What does it take to be disbarred in California? Good grief-attempts at ex parte communications with the judge, and her history of sanctions in other cases seems to merit suspension at bare minimum!   When they're the party in a suit, such as a criminal case, family law case, etc., it's not quite so easy to dismiss their filings.   That's a question best suited for your lawyer, since debt collection is not my area of expertise. As I recall, (keeping in mind that I can't give you legal advice, I'm not your lawyer, and it's past my bedtime so my memory may be a little foggy), there may be a difference between what an agent of the company can do versus a debt collector. First party collections is generally not covered by the Fair Debt Collections Practices Act. I don't recall off the top of my head if this is a request that needs to be in writing or not.   If threatening to turn you in to the feds is threatening you with federal law enforcement, be smart and lawyer up. That's treading dangerously close to extortion if not over the line.   *grins* To be fair, we almost never know when a case is coming down. ;) Suspect, maybe, but unless it's the last day of the term....   Gotcha. In that case, we're in complete agreement. :-)   I really mean no disrespect when I say this (as opposed to people saying no disrespect when they really mean that they don't care that they're being disrespectful), but I wonder if you and the SPLC are both overstating your respective cases. It does seem overblown to suggest that the issues of courts and the participants being swamped is a result of sovereign citizens and not chronic underfunding and a lack of staff. On the other hand, I think you may be understanding the amount of resources that sovereign citizens drain compared to a more "normal" or rational case.   To put it in tl;dr terms, The prolong, dragged out nature of these cases is a significant burden on the system, more than just being merely annoying and rarely violent, so I disagree with you there, but I think the system would be pretty well and truly borked regardless of sovereign citizen issues, so, I disagree with the SPLC too.   For those paying attention, the white nationalist side of the sovereign citizen movement has been reasonably well documented by the media, but the press has not gotten into the Moorish off-shoots very much. (Although the Southern Poverty Law Center has certainly taken note of the many African-Americans involved with the movement. see http://www.splcenter.org/get-informed/intelligence-files/ideology/sovereign-citizens-movement )  I thought law.reddit.com might be interested in the Post's treatment of the Moorish sovereign citizen movement.      This sort of activity is one reason even in cases with DNA evidence, there is a risk of wrongful conviction. In the midst of the death penalty repeal debate in Maryland, some state senators argued that the tightening of MD's death penalty statute a few years ago that limited death penalty eligibility to cases involving a videotaped confession, evidence on videotape, or DNA evidence was sufficient to avoid wrongful convictions. (One state senator even loudly proclaimed he was tired of hearing the other side of the issue utter the name Kirk Bloodsworth, a Maryland man freed from death death row who was in attendance at the hearing, because they tightened the statute to prevent that sort of scenario.)  DNA doesn't speak for itself, however, It's interpreted evidence, interpreted by science, potentially manipulated accidentally or purposefully, and at risk of having a forensic person lie about the result.   I'm glad you stood strong!   Yikes. Sorry you went through that.   What did the 8 group leaders want to ask you or tell you?   Sorry to hear about this. :( I do tend to suspect it might be a matter of sequestration, as callmehondo said below. It definitely sucks and is unfair, but there's also not much in the way of potential remedies for it...   My only suggestion is to contact some alums in the private sector (if there is a private sector counterpart to what the job would have been), say what happened, and ask if they know anyone who might be able help you find an equivalent internship. (You'd probably have to go unpaid instead of paid, but better than nothing...) Given that you so obviously got screwed, alums of your school may be more inclined to help you than the average person who shoots them an e-mail.   Some pay, some don't. Pathways program, for example, are all paid.   Testing people's security by walking up to their houses and jiggling the door handle will probably get you in legal trouble. Going inside houses, taking an item from each, and giving your spoils to the press to publicize the issue will definitely get you in legal trouble.   An interesting mix in the decision making: Breyer wrote the majority, joined by Roberts, Thomas, Alito, Sotomayor, and Kagan. Kagan wrote an concurring opinion joined by Alito. Ginsburg wrote a dissent joined by Kennedy, and joined by Scalia except to parts III and V-B-1.      We live in a very scary world. Glad the guy was arrested, and I hope your coworker is doing better now.   It's a state-specific analysis, so, hard to give you advice in the abstract...   Good for you! :-)   I'd hope that surveillance footage might be worth at least handing over to police.... Assault is a serious matter.   I'm distressed by the number of stories in this subreddit that involve things being thrown at employees. Do stores really not call the cops over this? It's assault, for goodness sakes.   You certainly won't have opportunity for street busking like you might in Boston or NYC. Playing for free on the Green? Sure. Having folks toss money in a hat? Not going to happen.  But yes, there are plenty of things to do. The Dartmouth Outing Club has many outdoorsy options beyond extreme sports, if you're interest in skiing, there's the Dartmouth Skiway, there's horseback riding at the Dartmouth Riding Center, there's pickup sports games, there's frisbee on the Green, there's the Hanover Country Club if you want to play golf, etc... All sorts of options.  There are sometimes open mic-type events at the Collis Center, and you may be able to arrange playing there as well. Not many places to play off campus because there isn't much "off campus" in general. There IS an acoustic music showcase at the Canoe Club, a restaurant a block from the Green. I'm not sure if it's an open mic night or what-that particular event only started up last month and I'm long graduated, but you could give them a call or e-mail and ask. http://www.canoeclub.us  As far as not getting bored, the Hopkins Center for the Arts is pretty good at bring fascinating performers to campus, and student tickets are really cheap. I definitely miss getting front row tickets for artists like Itzhak Perlman or Bobby McFerrin for $5. (I think they're $10 now, but $10 to hear the likes of Yo-Yo Ma, who performed at Dartmouth this past September, seems like a bargain to me.) The Hopkins Center would also probably be the folks to contact to ask about jam sessions and the like-they should know...   Profiling is legal, so long as it isn't based on prohibited criteria, such as race, nationality, religion, etc. Having a pot leaf sticker or t-shirt isn't a protected classification.  Looking like a stoner doesn't give the officer a right to have a dog brought in-the officer already has a right to have dog brought in, and has the right to exercise discretion as to whether to bother or not. Making that decision because someone looks like a stoner, so long as the officer's definition of stoner isn't based on a suspect class like race, etc., perfectly okay.   Apparently, the government must intrude on individual rights to ensure the government doesn't intrude on individual rights.  	110
    I can't believe they are making a sequel. Maybe this time Jaden Smith will hack into the Alien computer using nothing but his apple watch.    The Fire-Sale audition clip from Arrested Development   Stand by Me by Oasis      What I thought was romantic at the time: Back in the early days of the internet, my gf at the time and I were doing our respective internships. I had internet at work which was fantastic. She only had access to email but no internet and constantly needed to look things up. So I stayed awake all weekend and wrote her a program that ran on my home desktop computer where she could email  search query and my computer would email the Yahoo or Altavista results (can't remember which) back to her. Then she could email the result link and it would download the page and email it to her as a static html page (the whole web was static html at the time so this was the easy part).   What on hindsight was actually romantic? My gf and I lived in two different continents. I did 5 years of long distance. We moved to a 3rd continent, and then I moved cities twice, before finally moving in with her and now she is my wife and its been 10 years since we started dating. One of my better decisions.          I think its better to do marketing at a larger company, even if that means starting at an entry-level type role. It can be a good career path, a chance to learn data and analytics tools that are increasingly important in marketing today and a chance to get some branding on your resume. Risk with small agencies is that you end up with a decent job but not a great career trajectory from there.     What industry? Sales in general? If you have an aptitude for sales (some do, some don't) its very viable. Good sales people over time can either go on to either sell larger and more complex products and make meaningfully more money, go into strategic / business development roles, or take on sales leadership roles. So there is a valid career path if thats what you are interested in.  The same goes for marketing.   Candidly - your best bet is either to go to a large organization where you can have meaningful career growth opportunities, mentorship and training, or to go to a decent sized startup that is growing fast so you get chances to grow alongside the company. The startup path is definitely more risky.  My advice to you would be to think about how to move to a company that can give you those types of career challenges and get you into more of a business role. You are absolutely right not to want to stay in administration. Sales / Marketing / Biz Dev at the right organizations will never go away and will always be rewarded.    Given that you have marketing experience and a marketing focused education (admittedly a minor), there is no reason why you shouldn't try and get a marketing job.   This is a list of such roles that could be interesting:  http://tapwage.com/channel/fight-night-marketers  You could also potentially look at sales, especially ad-sales which is an interesting and lucrative path. Jobs like these:  http://tapwage.com/channel/selling-eyeballs  If you want to stay around fashion, there are a number of fashion focused startups you could look at as well. These are interesting because they might find parts of your background really interesting, they are more open ended roles where your responsibilities can grow as the company grows, and you can then transition into bigger roles at more established companies.  The way you position yourself in your resume and interview is really critical for any of these. If you come across too administrative focused, you often get typecast into office manager / admin roles. You really need to emphasize the marketing experience, show that you understand the broader industry dynamic and trends and had a more business-oriented role. Emphasizing quantitative and analytical skills over things like HTML / Photoshop will be helpful too (once you veer into HTML ./ Photoshop, people are unlikely to take you too seriously in a more marketing / analytics roles)     Look for some Unity  / Open GL related open source projects on github and try and become a contributor to one of those teams. Having code contribution at a public project is often more impressive and a better validation of your skills to an employer than a private project you might do. Also good experience working with other developers and learning about the more practical elements of development      Consulting and Risk management have very structured recruiting cycles so you can apply for those roles but unless you are prepared on the path, its difficult to break into.   Here are junior risk management jobs: http://tapwage.com/channel/beach-closed-due-to-credit-risk-sighting  Here are junior consulting jobs: http://tapwage.com/channel/from-consultant-to-corporate  For risk management, my advice would be to focus on non New York jobs that are more geared towards consumer risk management since those are easier to get into  A few other potential careers to think about: 1. HR: I know a lot of humanities majors that got a break into the corporate world in an HR role. These can be useful entry points and fairly interesting jobs. Like these: http://tapwage.com/channel/people-person-unicorn-edition  2. Another option is potentially doing a writing job http://tapwage.com/channel/pop-culture-writers  3. There are a number of Non-profit jobs here that don't require a masters degree  http://tapwage.com/channel/giving-back-to-the-art  http://tapwage.com/channel/non-profit-development-lieutenant   unfortunately, each of these will take you away from your goal of IR.      It sounds like you should work at a startup in a data and analytics role. This might give you a chance to leverage your analytical skills but also work in the "core business", and do something exciting. Example of such jobs are here: http://tapwage.com/channel/data-driven-mbas-at-startups  Another option is to try and move into impact investing. This is a really interesting career. Will combine your finance and analytical skills with your desire to do something more meaningful for society, traveling and adventure. Collection of such jobs here: http://tapwage.com/channel/initiation-to-impact-investing  Guide to impact investing here: http://tapwage.com/cheatsheets/2015/05/06/guide-to-impact-investing  Good luck!       Sorry that it took a while to come back to you. We are upgrading our search engine on our site to be instant and better. Once thats done I can point you to some interesting opportunities.   One category of job that could be interesting is financial operations/  business analyst. This is inline with what a few people before said about potentially looking at banks. Some of these only require an associate degree or a GED. They have a real career path in finance and ops, and are less people-oriented and a chance to shape an interesting career  http://tapwage.com/searchresult?keyword=financial+operations location=Florida  Another option is to be an office manager. Also a good job with your skill set, a potential operations and administrative career path and potentially a better pay and perks than retail  http://tapwage.com/searchresult?keyword=office+manager location=Florida sortBy=relevance  We'll have an updated instant search engine by the end of the week so will be a lot easier to search for these jobs and you should be able to find quite a few in Florida / Southwest.   Hope it gives you a few ideas about where to look.                   Roughly whereabouts are you based or what types of geographies are you looking at? We are still bulking up our job database but I can specifically dig in certain geographies if helpful (we just launched the site so would be a great test case for us)   The show TwentyTwelve that aired on the BBC (I am in the US. Saw it on iTunes). One of the funniest sitcoms of the last few years.      What type of consulting? Could you elaborate on the nature of the job?   Business development is one option. This is sort of sales-like but also involves strategic deals, partnership, channel management and can be really interesting - especially at a startup or a more nimble company. Jobs like these: http://tapwage.com/channel/if-you-start-me-up-if-you-start-me-up-ill-never-stop http://tapwage.com/channel/unicorn-business-developer  Alternatively, you could look at ad-sales if you have the experience. Its not like direct sales at all and can be a lot more fun and lucrative. Jobs like these: http://tapwage.com/channel/selling-eyeballs  Finally - you could also look at more B2B / enterprise sales. These are very lucrative and are completely different than direct sales / home improvement sales but leverage your background. But many of these require some specific skill sets / experience so might be hard to get.  Jobs like these: http://tapwage.com/channel/rainmakers-with-benefits     Given how much data science is in fashion, depending on the city, there should be no reason to take a significant payout. Your engineering background will definitely help, as will the fact that you are learning Python and R. But as NotARandomNumber points out, it depends on location. NY, LA, SF, DC are much likely to pay 100k+ than some of the smaller cities.  A few ideas for you: Data science is a misleading category since that typically involves a PhD. There are a ton of great data and analytics roles out there that don't involve PhD but they aren't always labelled data science  Here are some data and analytics jobs in finance / large banks that you could consider:  http://tapwage.com/channel/artificial-intelligence-meets-financial-intelligence  You could also consider data analytical positions at large corporations (ignore the MBA in the title. MBA is preferred but they are open to quant degrees)  http://tapwage.com/channel/data-driven-mbas-at-big-corporates  Look at operational jobs that specifically value military and naval backgrounds. These can be wide ranging, very interesting and are increasingly strategic and analytical. Examples of such jobs is here:  http://tapwage.com/channel/operating-with-military-precision  May of these will also consider and reward your engineering background Let me know if you are looking for something more specific with your background and I can try to point you in the right direction. Good luck!      Thats a really difficult situation with loans. My #1 advice would be to create a compelling portfolio of writing samples that you can customize for various jobs.   If you are struggling to get a gig at a big media outlet, try and get a foot in the door with a digital media startup (there are so many out there these days and they are hiring aggressively).   here is a set of journalism jobs. If you get your foot in the door at a place like Vox or one of the other digital media entities, the pay isn't great out of the gate, but depending on where you life it might allow your friend to cut down to just 1 full time job. Gives you a chance to build a public portfolio, get some visibility and navigate into a more serious journalism role down the line.  http://tapwage.com/channel/reporting-the-news    You don't need a liberal arts degree. You just need to write well. If you want to be a journalist, you should, and there are a number of business journalist jobs out there in both traditional media publications / TV outlets and new digital media outlets.   Look at these jobs here: http://tapwage.com/searchresult?keyword=business+reporter location=  or this journalism collection here: http://tapwage.com/channel/reporting-the-news  These jobs generally don't require journalist degrees. They just need good writing samples which hopefully you have.   Moreover, there are very few reporters with real understanding of accounting and finance so you could leverage your background to give you a leg up by writing about M A, finance, business etc. I would add these to your writing samples so you really stand out for some of these jobs. Good luck!      I read it as he jumped in the river to save a drowning frog. That would have been even more impressive.      	34

 You are dead   The items beta test are pose to be getting in the live version of the game for beta testing?   Closed beta Client 2, do I need to redownload the entire client when it is launched or will it update?   ESO is almost 60gb. Do some research.   Let's talk about these armored bear mounts. Will we be able to ride em, or are they npc only?  	5
    Possibly. I'll try and look it up. That'll be in part two and also when I'm done there too. Check for it in the next couple of days  	2
 From my experience myself and everyone who has been through this. Its usually just a phase. I say give it time.   Are you an angel? Because i have an erection   If you can accomplish that i doubt anyone will want to challenge you.   Well since I've been using the app for almost a year I've met about 10 girls that actually wanted to meet. Thats very good for a guy like me. Im average looking i just put the basics and keep it simple. I get their attemtion by asking them about something they are interested in. Usually you can find that out on their profile. Its alot of hit and miss but its still effective   Im sure most girls who meet him end up liking him   And even more different to cokeheads  	6
 !gameMe   I have it built, do you think it would be worth it to set up a server for it? Maybe I should message the subreddit mods and see if they approve of it running 24/7 for this subreddit.   lol yah. I'm having rate limitation issues. I need to build the bots karma up for a few days before I launch it fully.   D'oh, street view would be from a while ago .  I believe that the reference to Florida was just a story. That story was the one part of it that seemed too forced/fake.    Update: All done now, should be working on this subreddit as well !gameMe   !gameMe   The banners don't match the ones in the videos, would they have changed them in two weeks?   !gameMe someServerThatDoesn'tExist   Don't we all need a little ego-boosting from time to time? ;)  I can't really think of when it would be used either, but it'll be there if people want it.  (Also, I'm almost done now, so too late!)   There's a [playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7VQARbRhYA list=PLIvrgpZKZrKim6ga0LD3PBbopdqRQ3Lhf) of all the videos. It's terrifying, idk what's going on D:    What is that in the [window](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJ-u4_sQSNk)!?!      I'm trying to play around with reddit's API, and I got a neat idea for a bot. a gameMe/hlstats bot that pulls your stats for a specific server and posts them as a comment. e.x.  test_subject3547: "!gameMe someServerName" gameMeBot: "Pos: 9001 Points: 0"  You would associate your steam and reddit accounts with the bot by sending it a PM like "associate STEAM_0:XXXXXXXX"  Any interest/suggestions? I would probably make it search through this subreddit, /r/gaming, maybe /r/steam and any other subreddits for games tracked by gameMe.  Edit: I've got a prototype working, just working on customizing which server to pull stats from.  	13
 Suddenly I stop reading   And my hands,    They refuse to turn the page       The words in the book   Become a blur   My eyes lose focus   And my mind sees you    My stomach reminds me   Of a bird in a hailstorm    My legs lose all feeling.   The couch dissolves.   The room disappears.    There is only me   And you inside.    A halo of pain   Places itself upon my head.    And tightens.    A crown of thorns.    I do not understand how anyone can find this pleasurable  I laugh nervously to myself   As my heart fills     With the emptiness of the night     I think your content is good, but you seem to be in the same boat as me. We need to edit much, much more.  I'm having to be frank with you, but you (and I, that's why I'm saying this) aren't "natural" poets -- the kind that write a masterpiece in one sitting.   We have poetic thoughts, then we put them down. But without refinement, we are just stones on a beach.   And capital!   That's true :) I've read a lot about his darkroom awesomeness. But I've never learnt photoshop, and I'm trying to get the photos in-camera to a decent level before I try!      I kept jumping from DE to DE like politicians on abortion, but once KDE 4.8 came out, I'm comfortable.  It's the best thing I've ever used. But it does require playing with settings a lot to get your desktop out of it.   Be brave and hang in there. Good to hear you are going to get help!  If you need someone to talk to, I am only a PM away.   Wow :)    Not for depressed people :(  Work on it? No.  Stop dwelling on it? No.  No. No. No.  Fuck. The picture makes sense. Why doesn't it work?   No. No. No.  Maybe I should get off this subreddit.   Okay, that's just boolean logic (propositional?). Does not apply to axiomatic systems of proofs at all. I don't know the semantics of logic, really, but I meant the way of thought that we use in mathematical proofs. And transitivity (a = b and b = c  = a = c) is something that is not assumed in logic, but has to be proved.  The theory of vaccines, information technology and all that exist because people were willing to question everything. Which is just what I'm doing.      Oh I did not know that at all..What are the species of circularity? Is there anything I can read to know more?  The fact that launching a rocket and children throwing balls are similar changes nothing about the fact that we are not questioning the Scientific Method. The thing is, I am sure people have questioned it and have answered much better than me...So I'm just looking for sources, I guess..   Shouldn't have brought God into the mix, sorry. I'm not worried about God at all...I just like thinking about these things.  Of course circularity is useless. When you have a circular proof with no way around it, it means you have an assumption you cannot prove. And that was what I was asking -- whether the Scientific method is such an assumption. It seems it is, for now at least.   Which is not a bad thing at all. We have to start consistent thought somewhere :)   The scientific method is what makes me question the scientific method. That's the beauty of Science (and Philosophy I guess), right? You question everything, including your questioning...till you die!   1. Yes of course. And that very method allows to question the method itself. Which is all I'm doing. No God involved :)  2. Occam's razor tells us to choose the one that makes the fewest assumptions as our theory. Nothing about right or wrong since the competing theories already have to be able to explain the observations anyway.    Ah, this was exactly the kind of answer I was looking for!  But see ... you're using the method of proof by contradiction to demonstrate that E - mc2 = 0. And that method derives from the axioms of Math, which in turn are derived as hypotheses from the Scientific Method. I would love to see an axiomatic math researcher's (if that's what they're called) comments on this :D  Occam's razor as fundamental law makes sense I guess.  So it's an axiom...which leads to an interesting quandary whether you choose the axiom of Occam's Razor or whether you choose the axiom of God.  While I will always choose Occam's Razor because everything I do rests on it, I can't really tell a religious guy not to do it because half of everything he does rests on the assumption of God :-/   No. God is an extra axiom that you would need in addition to the axioms of Science.   Basically, God is not a necessary assumption you need to make to explain anything in the observable universe (yet), so God doesn't exist. That's the way I've understood it.   Ah...that makes sense...thanks!   I've been thinking of this question for a while now, but have been scared to post on here because of all the hostility on here. Though my questions have nothing directly to do with God or religion (only with concepts used in arguments), so I have hope!  Before you pick up your pitchforks, atheism is my description of choice, though I find the absence of God (or his imaginary presence) has very little relevance in my life.  So, I read through the popAtheism of Dawkins and Hitchens. I went reasonably deep into the philosophies of Science etc., so here's some questions I've ended up with (If I'm stupid, tell me, but also tell me why :) ) :  1/ Is there any justification for the Scientific Method? Well, of course it works. But it doesn't really do anything outside of the scientific method. You make a hypothesis, you do experiments, you make predictions, you do experiments, and you smile if it agrees and change the hypothesis if it doesn't.  So that's a good method. But is there any way "outside" of the Scientific method to justify it? Because proving/verifying a theorem/concept using itself is pretty useless.    So any prediction made using the Scientific method is a validation of the hypothesis, not of the Scientific method itself.  Right? Or do I have something wrong somewhere?  2/ Occam's razor: This for me, was the strongest proof of the non-existence of God. Still pretty strong. Have a question about it:  So, Occam's razor says that given two hypotheses explaining the same set of observations/phenomena, you choose the one that makes fewer assumptions.  My question is: Isn't the Occam's razor itself an assumption?!  Of course, it IS certainly a **reasonable** assumption (far more reasonable than God) with a **valid** (in my mind) probabilistic justification (fewer assumptions means fewer ways of being wrong).  BUT: The justification itself depends on probability, which depends on the choice of mathematical axioms, which depends back on Occam's razor. Circular!  Is there something wrong with my logic?   Oh? Really? Wow...  How is it a flaw in security? Does it make your phone less secure?   If say, they made phones easily rootable, would the phones be less secure?   Sorry if this question is stupid:   I have a Motorola Bravo (very obscure phone) and linux and little patience -- a combination that has led to many attempts, all unsuccessful, at rooting.  Though this has got me wondering: Why do the carriers/manufactures make such a big deal out of rooting?  I understand that it voids your warranty, since you're messing with stuff at a low level.  But apart from that, why does it bother them so much?   I've already paid for the phone, and am not paying any less by rooting it. I'm still paying the same amount monthly as I did before rooting the phone.  So what's the difference to them?  It's like saying people can buy a plain t-shirt, but can't paint anything on it :-/  I'm sure there's something wrong in my logic...but can't see what.  EDIT: Well, that's cleared up...Thank you all :) Asking a question in a different time zone means you wake up to answers :D   Also, I did not know Sid stood for Siduction :D   Did you guys figure it out? The same thing happened to me yesterday.  A new problem is that 'kmix' seems to be crashing every time I login!   Indian reporting as requested!  I don't see what caste has to do with slums...People of all religions, castes and creeds live in illegal slums...but since you asked about caste, here I go.  It is important to keep in mind that *different  Indians see very very, different Indias*. So reporting today in this comment is a middlish class Bangalorean (big city) who lives in a nice sheltered area. Like many houses here, we have a lady who comes to do our dishes and to clean the house.   The caste system is still in vogue, but I would say it's going out of style in the cities. ** For everyone above a certain economic class.**   The servants (maids, cooks etc) are still all of lower caste (the converse is not at all true). Whether they are discriminated against or not ..... (to be continued)   (the relationship between houses and the people who serve there are complex and involve many members of both families, exchange of gifts and the such..., it's very common for them to become extended family while still being servants)  (continued)...... it is undeniable that all of them are from the lower castes.   So I would say (in my India), there isn't direct discrimination, but well...my mother wants me to marry someone from the same caste.  The history of the caste system provides some weak justifications for it, but as the great Ari Gold (Entourage) once said: There are no asterisks, only scoreboards.  Well, this isn't very informative. the **tl;dr** would be: There is no direct discrimination (in middlish class India in a big city), but there are a lot of conservative ideas because of which the caste system still carries import.  On the other hand, there is the issue of reservations in a lot of places for the "lower" castes...but that's a different discussion.    Thanks!  I'll be alright, I guess :)   Oh *facepalm*! I had used alsamixer so much back in the day...Had completely forgotten about it!   Yup. There was no mic slider...I think veromix was fucking things up..   Oh thanks! Will look at this!   I would have agreed with you yesterday morning. But when faced with evidence.....  The problem is with the way kmix/veromix interact with each other, I think...but can't say anything more.   I'm on Kubuntu 12.04 beta.  Yesteaday I had to video chat with a friend. I kept my mother's window laptop by my side on account of my experiences a few years ago.   I installed the google video chat plugin and lo and behold, my webcam was working fine. But...my microphone wasn't!  So I installed unity and logged back into it and everything worked!   Windows was kicked out the door.  Though I would have liked if it had worked on KDE, because I like KDE.   Any ideas why it didn't work? I am using veromix with pulseaudio on KDE and the default soundmenu on unity.   Magnificent!!! :)   That's cool. I wish I was around so you would have an extra shoulder :)   Hang in there. I can't help you with much really, but I can tell you this after being through a lot education:  Take the courses you like! Work hard! Learn stuff! IT DOES NOT MATTER if you're unintelligent and you fail. IT DOES NOT MATTER if you're super intelligent and you get an A.  I mean, it does matter for a while, but believe me. I've failed and gotten As on courses and in a few years, all that will matter is that you took the courses you liked and tried to learn.   Keep learning, keep studying. Keep working. Keep trying.   You'll cry on some nights. Maybe many nights. Get through them and when you're reasonably okay again, focus on what you want and keep trying to do it.    **tl;dr** (Very long post... so putting a tl;dr at the top and the bottom): Was getting energy back in life. Lost it all again. Help needed.  I have to admit, I have not been diagnosed as depressed. I haven't even seen a therapist yet in my life. So I'm sure my problems aren't half as serious as the problems on this subreddit. Maybe I'm just weak. 28, male, single, failure, you know the usual. In any case, I would really appreciate some help.  Much of the last year was spent in a haze or sorrow and anger, mostly over a girl. It's not an uncommon story. I liked her, wasn't confident, didn't tell her (also, she had a boyfriend) and so traveled to the friendzone. (EDIT to add details: Burnt my fingers with cigarettes a few times, punched many trees and walls till my knuckles swelled up and I couldn't write a few times, drank a lot of whisky...nothing extraordinary inasmuch as life goes). Told her eventually and was told I had betrayed her   (which was true, I don't deny. I should have told her long before...but it was lack of confidence, not an intention of ... oh whatever).   We became friends again. We're roommates too now, so sometimes (since I see her daily) things still hurt in my heart. You know, the usual.  I am also doing a PhD in what would be considered one of the top 5 universities in my field with one of the top 2 people in my field. I said all that to indicate the irony that I'm going nowhere with it. He doesn't care what I do. If I was self-motivated enough to do something about all this, it would all work out. All I need to do is sit down and work. But I don't. You know, weak...the usual.  The end of last year, I decided I would turn a new leaf and fix my life, one step at a time, however small those steps were. I told some people on this very subreddit about my brilliant idea and got a lot of encouragement, and was even told I helped one or two! I started exercising, and dressing better and walking with my back straight. It was all getting better.  Then my mom got two tumours in her spine. She had one in her brain, and was on the road to recovery (or the equivalent for brain tumours). She had survived (even lived, you could say) two years longer than the 18 months she was promised. And then two completely new guys cropped up in her spine. Now she's completely immobile. I came back home to help and now can't go back to university for useless visa issues.   Which means I might lose my job.   The thing is, I was okay with all of this. But today morning, I realized I've lost all energy. Completely drained. I have close friends, but I don't particularly want to talk to any of them about it, becuase I've realized they don't understand. You know, the usual.  So, please help reddit. I have no energy left to start all over again on my smallStepsTheory.  **tl;dr**: Was getting energy back in life. Lost it all again. Help needed.    Ah okay, that makes sense...thanks! I was wondering what was changing in the wings...   Loaded in what way? Cargo? Why do the wings differ in height when the cargo is loaded?   I maybe stupidly misinformed...but is Prince Philip the queen's husband?  "The queen's husband Prince Philip..."  EDIT Oh nevermind. Someone else asked and was answered below    The kid doesn't understand much because he's young...that's what I think/thought.   There was a time when I used to think this was a song by Boyzone and how awesome the lyrics were awesome even though it was by them :D   Interesting answer. Thanks!  I'm not asking if the voltage exists in an existential way. I'm asking in the way us atheists say God doesn't exist because nothing He/She/It/Spaghetti does is measurable.   So for the battery, the voltage has meaning ONLY when the battery is connected, i.e. when the voltage can be measured (or if it can be measured in some other way, that's fine too).    However, before the battery is connected, the voltage is still Measurable, because I know that connecting the terminals will set up a current etc.   I was wondering if the above two things are in fact the same, and it is meaningless to talk about the "measurability" of something without actually keeping the possibility of measuring it in mind.   So is its existence accepted fact? Or are experiments still being conducted to verify whether it actually exists or not?  EDIT: http://www.tapir.caltech.edu/~teviet/Waves/gwave_spectrum.html They (It?) have (has?) been detected and measured...Not sure what you were trying to imply.  EDIT 2 : Okay they are still trying to measure them..sorry :) But doesn't put the spectrum on the same standing of scientific acceptability as the Higgs Boson? Something that's "supposed" to be there, but we can't see yet and will hopefully see when we experiment or else the world will fall apart?     I just replied on a [comment thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/rbhve/how_do_the_heart_rate_sensors_at_a_gym_work/c44l5ra) and that sparked my curiosity about this:  The question is: Is there a distinction in Science between "measurable" and "measured"? Can the potential between two battery terminals, for example, be considered a physical quantity before it's measured?  I guess it's kind of a stupid question....but I' not sure!    This is a tangent onto a philosophyOfScience question... I was under the impression that in Science, nothing exists if it's not measured.  Or maybe "measurable" is different from "measured" ... New thread required?      :) Good luck! Don't hesitate to make your step even smaller if this doesn't work! Keep trying to keep moving in the right direction :)   Well, it wasn't a waste of time. I got to do a fun analysis :)   Oh no :(   Never seen that meme used better. The final frame really hit me hard....Completely feel your feelings there!      I did my own calculations based on the numbers on his website.   It's not like I read "I flew!" there and believed it immeditaely.     Can't argue with that :)   Yeah even 2 Hz is enough for him to get the lift he requires. I used 10 Hz more out of excitement than anything else.  He's said he needs 2 KW of power for his weight, which is what the battery he's using provides.  EDIT (because I got some more free time): With 2 Hz, he'll need to run at around 6.5 m/s, which is a pretty easy sprinting speed (with weight attached). Good point though...With such heavy wings, 10 Hz would be crazy!   EDIT 2: I saw your videos. You have to realize that this guy's ornithopter is not even close to being as impressive as the ones you've posted. This is just some guy hacking together a thing that flies. It hardly does anything new in any way. Which is why I can't understand why people are so surprised by it!   It's not human powered, only human controlled.   See thread below. It's not necessarily fake.   Yes...Fun :) Especially if it concerns aerodynamics   Phew! Please tell me you're convinced of the aerodynamic feasibility :)  Again, I can't comment on the photoshoppiness of the thing...   You are completely right...Oops! :)  Here really, L/D doesn't matter. As long as he can attain the lift, he'll get into the air. And then fall out very quickly of course, but he will still get up!  However, his wing area is 15 m^2.  Part 2 of calculations...Note that I have no problem with you being right. In fact, the way this currently is: I am assuming you're right and hoping to prove you wrong.  CL = 1.4   L = 100 kg (Seems he has a 20 kg backpack)   S = 18 m^2 (From his website)   rho = 1.225      V = sqrt(100 * 9.8 * 2 / (1.225 * 18 * 1.4) ) = 7.96 m/s   So, now the question is if 7.96 m/s is possible. It means you run 100 m in 12.5 s. That is unfortunately extremely fast, but not unattainably so. All he needs to get in the air is maintain that speed for 2 s. Then flap hard enough.....not convincing  In any case, I guess the tide is currently in your favour.   I got some hope based on a WIRED article ([http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2012/01/humans-with-bird-wings/](http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2012/01/humans-with-bird-wings/))   But that article says nothing, really.  So, for now without further information (and even though he flew clumsily and came down pretty quickly), I have to say you must be right, though there is still hope for the man :)   ************ BUT WAIT!!! ******************  (Sorry for getting excited. I generally get that way when I get a sudden realization of what I was doing wrong)  EDIT! : I made a mistake. Flapping CL doesn't depend only on V, it also depends on the flapping speed itself!!!   Phew. I knew I was making a mistake.  So, let's say he runs at 6 m/s. And flaps at 10 Hz (10 times per second). The average speed (which on the back of an envelope can be assumed to be acting over the whole wing. Of course, the root won't move at all and the tip will move much faster) of up and down motion will be 10 Hz * 5 m (half span)/2 = 25 m/s.  There's my answer...  So the net speed the wing will see will be sqrt(6^2 + 25^2) which is far greater than what is required to get him in the air with a CL of 1.4. In fact, even with a CL of 1, he will still be able to get off the ground.  His low L/D of course, will bring him back down pretty quickly, which is what happened (he couldn't even fly for 10 s).  So I am convinced that his flight is CERTAINLY aerodynamically possible.   Thanks for your observations...Because of them, I do think these calculations are correct now :)    Ah, that's better.  I don't see why it's impossible. You have a good point there about the lift. Maybe you're right... Let's calculate see what CL is required.   Lif = mass * gravity = 80 kg * 9.8   Wing area = 10 m^2 (say 10 m span and 1 m chord)   rho = 1.225 kg/m^3  Now let's find out what CL you need to have to get a running speed of say 12 mph  -- a speed that shouldn't be hard to attain with significant weight on your back.  So,    CL = m * g / (0.5 * rho * S * V^2)        = 4.45  A CL of 4.45 is not high for a flapping airfoil (This one is in fact a nicely cambered airfoil cross section) since it generates generates lift both through unsteady and steady effects.   See Fig 2 on page 4 of ([http://web.mst.edu/~isaac/AIAA-2006-0450.pdf:](http://web.mst.edu/~isaac/AIAA-2006-0450.pdf).   The frequency there is about 2 flaps per second at it gets to a CL of 3 which is in fact certainly lower than for the guy, since he's flapping at a higher frequency. His Reynolds number is also higher than for the paper, which would mean CL is in fact higher than the paper).  So, back of envelope calculations support the dutch guy.   An L/D of 4 is certainly not high. Gliders have (L/D)max of up to 60. A Boeing 747 has one of 17.  But those are designed for high L/Ds (so is his wing probably, but let's not give him the benefit of doubt just yet).   A flat plate moving at an angle of attack of 5 degrees (no unsteady effects, so the value I get here will be conservative) has an L/D of approximately 5! (using the formulae in[ http://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/k-12/airplane/kiteincl.html](http://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/k-12/airplane/kiteincl.html))  So L/D of 4 is achievable too. In any case, I'm sure his drag was pretty high, which is why he came down so quickly.  So I guess your apprehensions are answered. I had fun doing the calculations :)  I mean, look at the guy. He flew for maybe 100 m and then came back down. It's not particularly impressive. But it's certainly not impossible.  A different thread on reddit however, talks about inconsistencies in the video (pixels and what not). Now, my specialty is aerodynamics, so I cannot comment on that :D  EDIT: Made a mistake in the calculations (didn't convert from mph to m/s)   Right...because that's what believers do when they see something they doubt. They go hunting for answers to their questions.   You're not crazy, but it's probably not fake. Some common arguments against it:  1. Human power is not sufficient for this: The aircraft if NOT human powered. A wii controller picks up his motions , passes through an Android phone which does the processing to give similar motion to the wings.   2. Flat wings can't generate lift/Up-down wing motion can't generate lift: The motion is not up-down. The wing is not flat. The cross section is an airfoil designed and the wing is designed with spars and ribs just like any model aircraft.  It required some digging and reliance on Google translate on the man's dutch website to get the above information.  So, you're not crazy, but it's not fake. It's also not that impressive. The thing basically is just an ornithopter that is getting it's control input from a human.    Shankar Tucker not equal to John McLaughlin. He plays songs from movies and in general, I like the original more.  In any case, that's just my opinion. Indian Classical Fusion FTW!   The next morning. In fact, it's worse today, which is the next-to-next morning after the swelling.   I had been waiting a long time for someone to teach me to use the weights and bars in the gym. I have always been more of a running+stretching kind of guy.  So two days ago, I met a friend with whom I worked out for an hour. We did squats, bench presses and bicep/tricep stuff with dumbbells.   Today, my left shoulder (the place where the shoulder becomes the arm) is hurting quite badly. While I attribute this of course, to bad form, I am not sure which of those exercises caused this...Any help would be appreciated, thank you1   I'm like you, except I'm 28 and I'm starting to walk with my back straight now! Go for it, keep taking these steps and eventually maybe hopefully possibly, you'll wake up more than 2 days out of 7 happy. If you do, consider all the effort worth it :)   If you run today and still do 11:30 for 2.4 km, I don't think you have any reason to worry.  I was doing 3 miles in 25 minutes, and now (three months later), I do 5 in 35, and this was without any training program or even a goal, whatsoever.  I'm sure that with a structured program, you will do great. For your distances, I would recommend reading training programs for reducing times for 2000 m and 1000 m races. Programs with slow days, distance days and fast days seem to work best.  Good luck!   I have done this and it works pretty well. The only two glitches for me:  1. Calls do not connect sometimes. But this happens very very rarely. And when it does, redialing again gets the call to go through.  2. Texts aren't received/sent randomly. This happens often enough to cause me pain. Especially bad is when I'm texting and the phone is switching from Wifi to 3G or the other way.  3. No texting without 3G.  I'm on AT T by the way...      I'm sick today and my neck is sprained like never before. It's hurting so much I can hardly move.   Feels good not to think about other things :)  EDIT: "Feels good", not "Feels not good"...Shit...I can't even get a post right!   There's a ppa available too (and has been for some time now):  http://www.webupd8.org/2011/03/sublime-text-2-ubuntu-ppa.html     Oh shit...I commented on the wrong thread! I was about to tell you that the OP is talking about the Transformer Prime and telling him about a 7" tablet may not be useful.  Oops. I should downvote myself for this!   7 inches though   Where is this place?   Wow, I am glad to have helped :) The table part is a true story!  I am male and 27... Can't afford (monetarily at least) to think about therapy or medication yet as a graduate student, but basically wasted away most of the last 1.5 years in a haze.   It's still not easy though. On bad weather days (as [Stephen Fry](http://www.lettersofnote.com/2009/10/it-will-be-sunny-one-day.html) calls them), it's not easy at all for me to believe that this system will work. But I try to believe him and wait for it to pass.     I was/am in the same boat as you.   But I have realized that things can get slightly better if you start accepting "slightly better" as an option.  And "slightly" is really really slightly. I thought I would clean my room, I didn't. I thought: Fuck the room, let me clean my table. I didn't. Eventually I settled for buying $3 bin from Walmart and dumping stuff from the table into it. So the table looks clean now.  Tomorrow, I will make my bed. The table will get dirty again. I'll put it in the bin again.  I guess what I'm trying to say is don't try to force yourself to take a step if you don't feel like it. Keep reducing the size of the step till you can actually take it.   This is getting long and maybe irrelevant, but a friend and I were discussing motivation today: We realized we have come to be depressed because we expected the sky from our lives and were not motivated enough to actually do anything to get there. While we have had this discussion many times before, today was particularly enlightening since we also realized that while not doing anything to reach the sky, we had actually dug a deep hole for ourselves into the ground and jumped in.  So now, we have to first put in effort to reach the ground. Before that, we have to accept that we are at the bottom of a pit. Then, we climb one step out. Which for me meant exercise half an hour every two days. When I couldn't do that, I exercised 15 minutes every two days. Now I'm upto half an hour every day. Eventually, I'll be happy. That's the hope.    I am in the friendzone and I have to say, the discussion here is far more helpful and informing than the one on r/funny.   Though I guess [/r/funny](/r/funny) isn't meant for help anyway. So power to both!   Leaving for work. I put on my shoes and my jacket fifteen minutes ago.   Now Imma sweatin'    and  Imma redditin'   What?! Art majors don't lead a fulfilling life?  As an engineer, I've been blaming my choice of major for my lack of fulfillment all along, telling myself that if I'd taken up writing like I wanted to, I would have been happy now.   No. There is a lot to see...it was different actually being here, of course!  Though I completely agree with you about getting out of the inhabited areas...National Parks FTW!!   Hmm...I'm indian, and this is an actual conversation I had:  White Woman: So in India, do you really go to school on elephants?   Me (laughing making it obvious I was joking): No. We have camels for that.   WW (laughs too): So what did you think of the US when you first came here?   Me: It was just like the movies!    WW: Which movie?   Me: Terminator.  Unknown to her, I wasn't joking! Apart from the action, the country looked exactly like in the movies and people seemed to act exactly like in the movies.   Hmm...This is kind of irrelevant to the question, I just realized. But...since I've typed it all....     I think I have said somewhere else on this reddit before that there are two schools of Yoga. Well, there are many, but there are two major schools that come to mind on reading the article:  1. The "modern" school - They believe that the final pose is what matters in Yoga. Props like ropes, stools and weights are used to get people to the final pose. This is why it is so painful. This is also why it is good for some people who are already physically ready for it. 2. The "classical" school based on Patanjali's teachings - [Patanjali](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pata%C3%B1jali) is a guy who lived long ago and happened to organize all the teachings of Yoga upto the point into "Sutras". His idea was that the main purpose of Yoga is to lead up to ultimate peace of mind and oneness with the body (and well..the spirit - whatever that is). The asanas are just routes to this. With this second route, most of what the article says falls flat and this is what I have been taught, though I am sure the first method has its own advantages.  One that is completely absent in Western teaching: The guru/teacher has to teach each student individually based on his/her physical and mental abilities and the student in turn places complete trust in the teacher.    I can recommend a book for sure: "The Anatomy of Yoga" by David Coulter.   That is what it translates to exactly. Sava is corpse, Asana is pose (or exercise). Don't know why you would consider it silly :-/   I went to a cemetery once when I was depressed and just sat there. It was about a girl, so it was easy to be depressed.  Eventually, I felt randomly peaceful and went to an interview that I had scheduled. The interview went well and I went back into the depressed state for a while.  Got off-track there. tl;dr: Went to cemetery and spoke, but to myself.   I took up writing and exercise. Sad and lonely makes for good poems that you hate when you write them, but look better later (much later, as in months or years) when you look back and maybe edit them.  Exercise is well...exercise. It's what I do to make the rest of the day slightly brighter.   I think what makes you think video games are wasted time is that you have nothing to show for it after the act. But you can look at it one of two ways: It doesn't matter, or if it matters, do something that lets you create or that leaves something with your mind after it's over.   Like poetry or art or music or woodwork or photography or rock climbing or hiking. Those are random examples, of course.   Though none of this will make you better immediately. That (I believe) is a gradual transformation. Doing things will get you stage where you can look at yourself without the self-deprecation that is so normal for people like us. Then, you can start working on being better. At least, that is what I believe and I working towards. I hope you can come along with me on this journey.  Feel free to PM me to talk or anything!   Nope. The respective combinations are...For me at least...   What's a cervesa?   Wow...I can totally see why you call this a wuss story, because that's what I call my life too. But I've realized that we are way more critical of ourselves than the world. We give others far more credit than we do ourselves.  Remember this: You have a girlfriend (I'm assuming you have a happy relationship) and you're healthy, which means you can do whatever you want with your life. I don't know the logistics of what you're trying, but maybe you can transfer to Science/Math in college? EDIT: And you're honest with yourself. Which is more than most of the world can say for itself. With this honesty and your apparent will to follow your dreams, I am sure you will do great at whatever you finally settle into.  I know exactly what you're going through because I went through very similar things and still struggle with these issues. The issues don't go away, unfortunately. But you do get better at dealing with them.   Your post is inspiring! Thanks!!   I don't have any good things left and I lost all meaning in my life recently.  I'm trying to get back at life by exercising daily, trying to eat well and sleep well. I am completely alone and I sometimes wonder why the fuck I'm trying anything when all I am is a tree that's falling in the forest with no one to see or hear it.  But just keep at stuff. Keep at something. Keep at anything. Forget about trying to get your chin up. Be sad and still keep doing things. Your chin coming up (sorry I'm using that idiom so carelessly) should be a side effect of what you are and what you do.   I asked exactly the same question a few days back in a thread :)  http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/nxkra/new_to_rfitness_welcome_and_discuss_your_getting/c3csj9o?context=3   I just want to say that I've always dreamed of riding horses and I have no idea why you think it's stupid.   Take it a day at a time. Follow Stephen Fry's advice posted on here a few days back (http://www.lettersofnote.com/2009/10/it-will-be-sunny-one-day.html).   I can only say that every day, try to worry about one thing. It would do you good to realize (only on sunny days of course, try your best not to make decisions on the stormy ones) that while your problems are way too much to be solved together, if you work on one (*and only one*), the others knots will begin (only begin, but it's something) to untangle.  Sorry for the vague advice, but PM me if you want and I can tell you how I'm dealing with my shit.   Ah. I was about to edit my comment to ask :) Well, I will be going to the smoky mountains sometime in the Spring from Illinois, so I'll make sure I ask on reddit before leaving!   I'll tell you what I went through, and maybe that will help (I'm a PhD student, so I can attest for sure that the graph as you currently have it is accurate):  1. High school -- All cool 2. College -- It goes wildly downhill and then wildly uphill and then wildly downhill 3. Grad School Part I (the MS) -- Similar to college, except it's not as wild. 4. Grad School Part II (the PhD) -- For me, it just kept going downhill and downhill till i was a broken wreck. I was a robot walking around. I couldn't work, and I couldn't rest. I was staring at the screen and it seemed like I was a worm eating myself up from the inside.   I used to tell people that I had used up all my willpower to get out of bed and get to my office, so I had none left to actually do any work.   Now it's slightly better. Somedays I'm a worm and somedays I work.   The days that I get work done give my life meaning and the days that I'm a worm give the work value.   India, where we have many other things :D   Somehow, when I was in college in India, we either went out to drink or we went out to eat. We never really had the concept of drinking and eating at the same time at a restaurant, except for Biryani and Kingfisher beer :D   Hope I/someone can help you out there and I really hope you get through this well :)   Nope. Will certainly keep a look out for it and try, though...Thanks!   Well, beer. As a grad student, I don't get to drink the Buds and the Millers, though I can say with confidence that they're quite bad.   I'm not really good at choosing good beer, but I can say for sure that I like Corona, Dos Equis, Delirium, and IPAs   [/r/depression](/r/depression) Lots of people going through similar/wildlyDifferentButKnowExactlyWhatYouMean there   Been here a while now, and these are my favourite things that I had not eaten before getting here;  1. Burger, beer and fries -- Ah, the combination! 2. String cheese 3. Pizza and coke 4. (Honorary mention) Blueberry milkshake 5.

 I am totally oblivious about Tennis, but I read about her while reading Andre Agassi's autobiography Open. I'm kinda happy she's associated with India in a positive way.

I believe it gets its name from Tikaboo Peak (sounds a lot like *peak*aboo, right?), in Nevada, where thrill seekers and conspiracy theorists alike will occasionally scale the barren wasteland to *sneak*  a *peek* at the near by Area 51. Get it? They're *sneaking* a *peek* on a *peak*... With a name like 'stealth mountain' I would have expected you to know this. Since then, the term 'sneak peak' has evolved into a few different meanings. The most popular among them meaning 'to get an early look at something that has not yet been released to the public'.  In this instance, I scaled my very thick pile of A Song of Ice and Fire books to catch a glimpse of future spoilers. The expedition was worth it, countless wonders lie at the summit. Unfortunately, all of that hard work is going to become obsolete in about ten weeks. I feel like a librarian. I just spent the last few years of my life sorting metaphorical books (and a few literal books actually), but as soon as I'm done with my life's work the Kindle comes around and suddenly all of my hard work is purposeless ancient history. Oh look, I'm ranting.  Anyhow, that's what 'sneak peak' means.   Khal Dwayne   Holy shit, I got a not-so-exclusive sneak peak. Glass half full.   That's what higher education is for ;)  EDIT: I am so fucking proud of myself for that.   [My favorite part] (http://i.imgur.com/rEbTrQP.png)   This literally happened to me once. Me and my friend were hot boxing his car, both at at least a [7] when he checked his phone and said, "Dude! Awesome news!". Oh, how wrong he was. Apparently he had just gotten a text from a girl he was trying to hook up with. She was at an 'ice cream social' and she wanted us to come join. Now at the time this did sound like awesome news. *An ice cream social!* I thought, *I've died and went to stoner heaven!* We drove off in pursuit of the delicious ice cream that awaited us.  On the way there my friend pulled into a church parking lot. Yes, a church. I didn't say anything out loud, but in my head I questioned this. *Had he made a wrong turn? Were we turning around?* Alas, we were not. Apparently, this was where the ice cream social was being held. It was at this point that I began to get worried. I almost didn't go in, but he had already told the girl we were coming, and as a bro I couldn't send him in alone. I retrospect, I totally could have and definitely should have.  Immediately upon entering I recognized many of the people there from my school. I realized I had no idea what type of group this was, so I decided to ask the girl we came to see. "Wait, he didn't tell you?" she says, "This is my churches youth group" Fuck. Fucking fuckity fuck fuck fuck fuck. Before I had time to burst out of the front doors an old woman summoned all of us to the center of the church in some sort of religious pow wow. No no no. Must. Leave. Now. Must. Find. Friend. Too late. He's already sitting down. FUCK. I run over and grab the seat next to him, all the while begging him to rush the exit with me. Again, too late. The room was silent, the old lady was taking roll call.  "Brian"  "Here"  "Sarah"  "Here"  "Kevin"  "Here"  Shes reading from a list. Thank god. Maybe she won't even notice us. Nope. That would be too easy, wouldn't it? Instead she says, "Oh! And I see we have some first timers here! Care to introduce yourself?" *FUCK NO, EVIL RELIGION LADY!!* I was high, don't judge me.  There was a silence. A silence that lasted much, much, much too long. I looked at my friend, and he looked back at me, both preying the other would answer. And then he did something that I will not forgive him for to this day. He reached in his pocket, and pulled out his phone. Instead of answering, he flipped open his phone and started texting away. I looked up. Old Lady McGee was staring directly into my eyes. I had to speak.  "Uh, hi. My name is test_subject3655"  Someone laughs. *Fuck youuuuuuuuuuuuu.* She smiles. "And why are you here today, test_subject3655?" she asks.  What?! This is a fucking interview?? I glanced back at my friend, still texting away. Shit, I was alone on this one. *Fucking hell!!! Wait, you're in a church, don't think stuff like that.* Again, I was pretty fucking high. "Um, yeah I think I just came for the ice cream." Silence. Complete, dead, silence. Not even a comforting cricket chirping away, utter silence.  "...alright." she says, before mercifully moving on to some other topic. We sat through another half hour of this before making a break for the door. Everyone knew. EVERYONE. Even Old Lady McGee probably knew. Never, ever ever again. Ever, ever, ever.  **TL;DR: Went to an ice cream social high as fuck, turned out to be a church youth group, got interviewed by an old religious lady in front of everyone.**   [AFFC] (#b "Ah ha!

Oh.   /r/humblebrag   I actually hate Five Finger Death Punch, this is an unbiased opinion. The fact that they're a heavy metal band is almost irrelevant, they play the song as rock. And there is absolutely no screaming, the closest they get would be the harmony during the chorus I guess. But like I said before, a piano isn't an instrument that can capture the message behind this song. There are many other songs where it can, but not this one. The Doors or Styx are good examples of song writing and composition that is perfect for a piano componet. Bad Company (the song, not the band) isn't. Its simply too mild where the song is too rugged. Kind of like playing Back in Black with a ukulele. Sure you can do it, and it will probably sound pretty cool too, but it will never compare to the raw power and passion behind the orginal song.  None of this means Bad Company is a bad original song, just that it could be better.  EDIT: Not sure why you're down voting me over a petty debate... When it comes down to it its an opinion, you shouldn't despise someone just because you disagree with them.   25/8/361  FTFY   I disagree, while it might ruin the mood of the orginal tempo, it captures the essence of the song much, much better. Its a song about breaking away from societal norms and rejecting modern customs (with regard to aggression mostly). The original version dosnt capture that at all. Five Finger Death Punch's does a much better job conveying that message and in a much more powerful way. Bad Company isn't a simple easy going song, its powerful and gritty and rugged. Where Bad Company missed the mark, Five Finger Death Punch nailed it.   [Bad Company] (https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=u_VsvZmIWxY) by Five Finger Death Punch.

The admins should change that.  EDIT 2: I just realized how awesome it is that Google knows how many episodes are in the next Game of Thrones season. Its officially a big deal.   That's the most terrifying thing I've read all day.   But...wait...how?...   Wait *was*? So you saw it?? If you had to rate it 1-10, 10 being the best episode yet, 1 made you wish you were a guest at the Red Wedding, what would you give it? But for the love of god, please don't drop a spoiler...    initially only available through Apple devices  I suffered a minor heart attack before realizing that I have an iPod somewhere. Off to buy a TV-hooker-uper thing for that.   Holy shit, my heart rate still hasn't returned a healthy level. Am I the only one who read this wrong and went running to my TV, then remembered I don't have HBO and ran back to my computer, went to the HBO GO website (ready to pay literally any amount at all), got confused when HBO GO wasn't a thing yet because it was promised to be in time for Game of Thrones, spent about ten minutes researching HBO GO on the internet, went back to Reddit to find answers, discovered none of this was relevant because I don't live in Georgia, and got a paper bag to practice some deep breathing exercises?? Yes? Well consider yourself lucky.      If the title was of any indication...no   "And as you can see, the blood stains *almost* washed out. Hardwood floors really are so hard to clean. Oh, did I mention the jacuzzi?"   What?   "*Oh my*..."   "Come to North Korea for our Supreme World Festival of Happiness and Education!"   "If she keeps pissing all over the carpet, were going to have to put her down."   "Come on, honey! In the 1800's, it would be a good thing!"   "I got the wallet, quick where are his keys?!"   "And avid geologist myself, I enjoy occasionally researching rocks and minerals on the internet. Crevices, cleavage, curves, you name it. Sometimes I'll go in my room and study geology for hours. I've been busted a few times caressing my rock hard granite while browsing the web, but hey who hasn't! Don't even get me started on polishing my garnets! Theres some great instructional videos on the internet for stuff like that."   Wouldn't it be worse if she wasn't a millionaire?   "Honey, why is my brothers car in the drive way again? Where are you, in the bedroom? Its kinda early for bed, isn't it? Hold on, I'll be there in a sec. I got a surprise that will completely and utterly shock you!"   "No comment"   "What do you think I did? I woke up, I took the belt off my neck and I got in my car and I got out of there"  "Talk about a wild weekend, right?"  "I thought I was going to have to shoot my way out. Haha, what are you going to do though, you know? Bar Mitzvahs..."   "You enjoyed Hershey Kisses, you loved Hershey Hugs, now try Hershy Fucks! The only logical next step in our line of seemingly deliberately sensual candies!"   "Honey, you know how crammed those darn airline seats are, right? Me too. But what would you think if I said you had an entire fuselage storage area to yourself?? None of those gross plane foods, no limited leg room and best of all, no line for the bathroom! Its like first class but better."   "Honey, is that your hobo?"   I have no quote here, I'd just like to point out that 'car tag' is a very real thing.   "Theres a shark on the wing!"   "Excuse me, honey, you might want to sit down for this."   "I guess fine, rare and expensive art collecting was just a phase"   "Excuse me, could you tell me how to get to the Orion Nebula? I'm new to this galaxy, I think I took a wrong turn at Alpha Centauri."   "Build your own miniature nuclear reactor with our DIY REACTOR KIT! Only fourteen-thousand easy payments of $19.99!

"Not here! This is the house of the lord, god damn it!"   "Im pretty sure its the blue wire"   U WOT M8   "Im going to tell you the story to Steves life.

So good, until you get to the name... Keep it 'Die Hard'   What?   [Vote here] (https://polldaddy.com/poll/8689513/)      I don't really know why, but that last one really reminded me of a [Jimmy Eat World] (http://m.imgur.com/ctvWF9p) album cover.   This is exactly what I thought of too. The title was something like "And she's really hot too!"   "I was walking down the streets of New York, homework in hand, when suddenly a Pterodactyl swooped down and grabbed it right out if my fingers. I would have stopped it but he flew up to the Empire State Building where King Kong caught it and ripped it to shreds with his giant gorilla hands. And then a thousand smaller Pterodactyls flew in and ate all of the tiny pieces. Which sucks because this is like the third time that this has happened."   "Whens the last time you saw a house in December that *didn't* have a nude Santa climbing down the chimney? Time to get into the festivities!"   In middle school, me and a friend made up a superhero named *"The Mistake"*! He had an imaginary side kick. It didn't catch on.   So the backing guitar is almost complete copy of Oasis' [Wonderwall] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hzrDeceEKc), the chorus is kinda like [Promises](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llDikI2hTtk) by Nero, but there are a lot of female singers who do things like that.

    Thank you                               Awesome!               Amazing :)   Thank you sooo much      Thank you       So cute im dying!  	22
 it sounded like a yoke   as somebody who barely makes 25k working shit hours in a kitchen, 100k is a milestone to wealth and prosperity for me.   U2 *is* gay   dude, working for google means you get dibs on tickets for Google IO, which is in it's self worth it.   It's crazy that that shit happens, I have an aunt threw same way.   you know... I'm going to take this goddamn moment to complain. When I was her age, we went out, and got a godamn fake ID. Or, we just borrowed someone's ID and said, "welp, hope I don't get this shitty expensive thing I just bought taken away from me..." But now, no. No no no. Now, you first have to get on reddit and validate you're actions with some anonymous other people. BAH!   ...I'm a bit drunk right now.   Yeah... Yeah, they do.   how, may I ask, is this nsfw?   perhaps I'm heartless. But if that were me, I'd have that cat back at my parents before that girl could even give me the sads. I'm across the country and I still love my cat.   Now is the time to begin cultivating skills that you enjoy doing. Skills can always be applied to different careers later in life.   your uncle Jerry is a good man,   yup   you can pull off a fedora with a polo, chinos and boat shoes.   Wearing a fedora is fine in my book if:  * You are wearing appropriate clothes that would warrant a fedora.  * The fedora is not a twenty dollar piece of shit you bought at hot topic    You sure taught her... You fucking ass clown.   lol I cannot believe you are getting downvoted for this shit. This is a general trend of ignorance that's getting greater by the day.   But anyway, in the case of hitting a dog I **pretty sure** that you're partly right here. But reporting it being legally required depends on specific counties. Now, if it damages your car... You can report it to the police and then go after the owner.    It looks better on him.   It is very interesting. I wasn't disagreeing with you, just throwing my two cents in... I grew up with two teetotaling parents. Well, one really, and one that was just in constant recovery.   As a kid, I often thought exactly what your comment was saying.   pretty sure you're wrong.   It's about fucking time.   I would like to say that it is a wrong strategy.   not being able to keep a steady job, or maintain a healthy relationship because you have to drink. Drinking so much that it could potentially kill you if you stopped.   I drink, but I've also seen how alcohol ruins lives.   Cigarettes will give you a heart attack at 55 maybe, or put a hole in your throat, or fill your lungs up with delicious tar etc etc... But booze can turn a person into a shade of what they were.    I laughed.   congrats, you ruined a man's life forever because of a petty childhood relationship.   uhh, what fucking signs of autism are you seeing exactly?   This comment should get more upvotes.    Jesus christ   I'll post this in the main thread in hopes that it will get over looked, but why should we be banning animal testing?   I would've used this grammar, "just... A little... Closer." But it's all good. (im drunk right now)   Protip: if you clean only the bathroom, she will love you forever. And it's not even that hard. it's just like cleaning up the mousetraps, or squashing spiders, a mans job. Think of it that way, and you'll be set.   As a guy, im frustrated when I can't find any pins, it means I haven't had a girl over in a while. Begin crippling anxiety.   uhm... wat?   hey now, the man knew what he wanted and asked politely. Imagine he had seduced you, got you back to his place and *then* tried to get you to go down on him in the shitter?   amen, brother. Shitty girls are shitty.   The idea, I believe, is to buy it in small quantities from many locations as to not draw attention.    This trick saved me in college. I was fortunate enough to have an awesome Russian professor who taught the whole class how to use the debugger and debugging techniques in my first year programming class. Later in both my algorithms classes I couldn't believe that kids didn't have basic debugging skills.     I just snorted coffee through my nose...   when you talk in real life, do fart noises come out?   thank you for addressing these points without resorting to ad hominem like I would have.   ahem.. I believe, if I am permitted to speak with the current vernacular of /b/, being a 4chan user for 3 years pretty much makes you, well, it makes you a "newfag cancer" ... Or so I'm told.   I came here to say that in a non offensive way. Now, let's see if I get downvoted or not.    He could be a junkie  shuuutt the fuck up.   And this surprises you?   I'm kind of into bridges myself. I found a whole case of eggs under a bridge last week. Perfect condition. None of them missing, none of them cracked. I mean, who in their right mind throws away a perfectly good case of eggs in this day and age.   You know, you're right. Fucking kid is an asshat. You're doing god's work, son.   really? someone bought you reddit gold for this?    It's hard to tell what you're saying here... It's also hard to tell which way I feel.    giggity   Alright BobbyBacula, I'm now convinced you're trollin.   for crying out loud, thank you! I want to smack these people around sometimes. Just little smacks though, nothing too violent.   why?   shooot her!   [to be read in an insulting tone of voice]  I believe the maximum temperature ok mars' surface is below freezing. These rocks would not be warm to us.    nah dude. alcohol is a magical thang    I was quoting the video game Mass Effect.   IF only we made some sort of discovery. One that would jump us ahead 200 years technologically...   Hey hey hey, this isn't fair! Some scientists have sex...once.   People are downvoting  this, which frustrates me... Because I've never liked the guy, for the above stated reasons. Now I know that there are more of you out there, I don't have to hide anymore!   I was a little shy in high school, but I had a couple of girlfriends and wasn't afraid to socialize, fell into a few cliques etc... I'm not sure if many high schools are like this in the country, but I grew up in an extremely controlled environment. We were not allowed to leave the building for any reason whatsoever with out a proper escort (usually the hall monitor, or school police officer), and were to be under constant supervision between school operating times. For after school activities, an adult was to be present at all times.  Now, I know that these precautions were taken for legality issues, but my point is that we were treated like children in an unhealthy way. I also know that under the eyes of the law most of us were still legally children. But the negative aspect of this type of coddling led to discouraging a lot of the kids there from doing important things early on.  Okay, so now to my point. When I got into college I still felt like a kid. I did well in school, I did well in life (mostly) but I had no fucking idea that I could actually **DO** things. I spent so much time in the later parts of high school feeling like anything I tried to accomplish wouldn't be taken seriously because I was still a child, and feeling discouraged because I thought that anything I tried to do independently would be perceived as childish, that I ended up doing nothing at all. I only realized that I had an ability to accomplish things greater than assignments and orders from older people when I was almost finished with college. And this, I feel, put me at a serious disadvantage. I realized later in life than some that the most important aspect of accomplishment is taking initiative. I was too happy going to school, having friends and getting drunk because it was what I was "supposed to be doing."   **TLDR: I regret not realizing that I could take life by the balls in high school**   This is actually sound advice if you work in a kitchen.   hahaha, in all fairness he did say, "Jay-Z is in the empire business," a little while ago.   came here for all the pansies yelling about abuse. leaving only mildly disappointed cause I had to scroll down a bit.   Oh! I doubt I'm going to give you any ammo for "abuse" really. I didn't really consider at the time that you may have been joking, and was trying to point out that the statement is idiotic because what the original poster said had nothing to do with linking the evolutionary fertility of rabbits to gas powered lawn mowers.   Simply that rabbits have to be so fertile because they so often choose poor locations for their nests. The guy was offering consolation, in that for some little bunnies that get mowed to pieces, hundreds more are getting eaten by various predators cause momma rabbits can't get their shit straight. So there will be more of these little fuckers running around in no time, which is great to think about when you just accidentally chopped a bunch of them up. He was offering consolation, not applying for a grant to study the evolutionary traits of rabbit breeding.   And that, good sir, is why you were an idiot for posting that remark. But hey, you got the karma for it... so it looks like I'm the one with egg on my face.    No! I'm going to take this side of the story: you didn't fuck up at all. It should be fine for you to have pictures of naked girls and have a girlfriend. You shouldn't be embarrassed about any of it. She needs to be secure enough to know that a male can and will view pornography regardless of whether or not he's got a fuck buddy, gf or wife. Plain and simple.   dude don't even worry! now the pressure is off of you. She knows, and you know that she knows. Now you don't have to hide the fact that you are making certain life decisions for yourself.   edit  To be clear... I'm not saying you should or shouldn't be doing anything. Just that you are becoming a man now.   start going in drunk! they can never accuse you again!   yup. You fucked up big time d00d.   I think it would most likely fall under libel... but anyway, I'm not a lawyer, but these charges are usually avoided if you can prove you were not doing it with the intent to defame and instead had the intent to make a farce of, or lampoon the subject.   aww, not the worst thing in the world. I'm sure the boyfriend and friend didn't mind a whole lot ;)   I prefer to take the Gob route with, "Hey guy!"   I want to pet the penguin   You are an idiot for posting this.   The falcon is fine. It flies off every day. During that time it's probably eating whole prey. It's flying back because it's got one of those smart raptor brains.   Implying that Huskies are really strong? Or really good dogs?   how to cook a fucking meal! and not some simple shit like boiling pasta and adding canned tomato sauce. Or make pancakes in the morning.  You shouldn't be afraid to cook any kind of meat. Knowing how to prepare simple chicken, pork and beef dishes is important. Also, know what vegetables are and how to use them.  This skill is so useful in life, because it will get you laid.    I don't think that you should be desensitized to listen to/watch something like this. It's about understanding the thing that happened and knowing that it did. Perhaps there is some kind of catharsis involved as well.  It's similar to Eisenhower wanting the world to see what the nazis had done in the concentration camps. Not only desensitized people went to view the atrocities, many people went for different reasons. And we still learn about them today as a reminder of the fucked up things that have happened in history in order to potentially prevent them from happening again.   I guess to sum things up, "it's great to learn, 'cause knowledge is power!"   yeah, It's really easy to say things like this. But enduring months upon months of barely eating will drive you crazy. I'm sure that these were good people, for the most part.   watch a movie.   could you perhaps offer some justification for your opinion? or are you just some troll?   I think... I think I love you.   man this used to work for me... but now it just makes me paranoid, and coupled with being hungover, I feel like I'm going to die. :(   you think that's bad. Try watching someone at a casino screaming about getting more of their money.   I think mostly because we read the news for the reporting of facts. Creative style shouldn't have to be parsed from an article to understand the facts. Embellishment leads to misrepresentation.   Also, I would find it very annoying if I had to read this shit when I was trying to get my news in on the bus to work.    okok.. so is this a new thing we're doing? It's like the fourth time I've seen this tonight.   nor should they   no  	85

Shows i was part of the OP and clicked without even thinking what it was. I originally thought you would just get a stupid April fools joke, now it seems the joke is on the people that didn't press it from the start.                           Youtube and netflix have been giving me all kinds of problems lately. In the last 24 hours they have slowed to a crawl and don't even load.

I grew up with grandparents on both sides, my parents vote republican. I don't see things the way they do and i seem to vote the opposite of them.  Edit - i should add that my grandparents weren't communists after reading some of these comments.             I don't have pictures at the moment, but can take some tomorrow.  While researching what product i should get, i came across [this.](http://www.alphasystemsinc.com/ProductCare)     Rubber roof (also known as EPDM) membranes are smooth. TPO and Alpha-Ply roof membranes have a haircel texture, which can be likened to an orange peel.   Was looking at [this product](http://www.epdmcoatings.com/rv-roof-repair.php) and it says     For Fleetwood models with ALPHA roofs you will need to use the ProFlex Primer    I'm pretty sure mine is a TPO/Alpha-Ply type roof since it is a Fleetwood and then would need to put down a primer before the rubber coating. The top of the RV is black in color and is not smooth so this makes me think it is not a rubber roof.   This seems the best way to fix it.   Edit - am back from getting beers   Clear your social calendar. We have to cook.   Just send me a pm   I live in the Los Angeles area and i'm not a pro chef by any means.

This might sound stupid to you, but i'm having problem disconnecting the power cord that connects my GPU (an Asus GTX 770) with my power supply (Evga Supernova NEX650G).

 That's what I thought - did you do it by hand or use the colorization tools?   What did you use for it?   Rich Stoklasa   Iz funny   Star Wars Sequel Trilogy - I *need* to know what happens!   Yeah, I watched The Godfather this week and it was utterly horrible compared to Kung Fury  Edit: (/uj) I actually forgot I was browsing /r/moviescirclejerk for a moment and I thought this was an actual /r/movies thread (/rj)   It's stupid to say something is unfairly judged by critics. That's why they are critics, is because they are qualified to be judging something. If the unanimous decision of the critics is that the movie is bad, then it might be true for a lot of people.   Alfred Molina IIRC - Satipo (Indiana Jones), Doc Ock, and some Prince of Persia character    Well, that's in terms of box office, not toy, book, and video game sales.   I have no idea why you would make a statement that's obviously going to provoke an argument.   So we're all neckbeards because we disagree with your opinion, which basically no one else has.   Logic = A+   I think the conversation was started in the mid-80s, with Gremlins and Temple of Doom. This was tame enough for the time, I guess.   Yeah, but not as good as Jaws, unfortunately   There was nothing groundbreaking or special about Avatar other than the special effects, which are now commonplace in today's movies. I can't see any Avatar sequels making anywhere near the amount of money that the first one made.  However, Star Wars may be the most popular and successful movie franchise of all time. Like you said, its appeal spans multiple generations all across the globe, and a sequel 10 years in the making is not something that no one cares about. 88 *million* was the number of views that second trailer had in *24 hours*. That's amazing. There is no doubt in my mind that its success will be equal to that of Avatar's.   Boring, art house, and foreign all sort of imply pretentious in the context you use it in...   http://imgur.com/HfO0EL3  Always loved this scene   Guaranteed 1 billion, likely 2, and if it's really really good, I can maybe see it passing Avatar as the highest grossing movie of all time.   *The Godfather* - not pretentious or foreign, it is just one of the best written and well told stories.  *Citizen Kane* - most of the cinematography, lighting, makeup, and storytelling techniques you see today? Citizen Kane invented those.   *The Empire Strikes Back* - nothing pretentious there. Just a good, fun movie.   To be honest, there wasn't that much explicitly wrong with it. Sure, the acting was bland and it could be dull at times, but it did its job as a disaster movie. It had the right blend of characters and action.   I elaborated on my point. You answered the question saying everyone hates Star Wars when you like it, but that's objectively not true.   Well, not really unknown with a few million subs   That was Sjin!   Think about how much hype that created. No way to see it online easily, and there hadn't been a Star Wars movie in 16 years.   No, they're really not. No one hates Star Wars. It's one of the most universally adored and most popular franchises.   **The World is Not Enough**  C'mon. It's a cool spy action movie. What's not to love?   Well, technically it was produced in Britain with some of their money... So...   Eh, more like an SNL sketch, not a feature length movie   The Godfather   The Elephant Man  Spartacus  The Godfather Part III   It was filmed there.  What makes 2001 British?   He does use the same quality and techniques for effects   I would think that  Kylo Ren = Darth Vader  Snoke = The Emperor  Gleeson's character = Tarkin  Captain Phasma = Boba Fett    I would think OP means from the two teasers   I think they've confirmed that was pulled from the film - if anyone could back me up on that, that would be great   My friends and I played the most intense game of Clue ever.   MICHAEL!   It just goes to show that, no matter what you say about the quality of those movies, George Lucas new something about marketing   - Have seen movie - Has read book  A few things that make the movie so great in my opinion:  Kubrick's direction  Nicholson's acting  Cinematography  Visuals  Suspense and fear  Though very different from the book, The Shining is a good film on its own   Wayne's World. Uh, excellent!   Written for the movie... So...      I would think "realistic looking computer graphics" fits better   Mad Marx: Commie Road  ayy lmao   Star Wars, 2001, Jurassic Park, Jaws   A few bad names =/= bad story, bad acting, bad directing, or bad visuals. Wait till the movie comes out. He won't ruin it.   The freakin' Cha-Cha Slide...  It's a 15 YEAR OLD SONG. How much fun can you have dancing to that after hearing 273 times?? It's the most annoying thing ever created my man.   So, average working person = moron? I guess we're all morons then...   Like Samsung or Google or Microsoft don't?   I wouldn't say horrible quality, Apple does make quality designed hardware and software that works for most average people.      Really? This is my favorite one so far    He's the man, the man with the Midas touch!!!   No, but it would be a more gradual decline to insanity, and I think he can do the whole "intimidating but strangely calm" thing   I've always wondered how to see google searches from previous years, thanks!   That's why I think Harrison Ford could've worked well in that role   Me neither - I think it was only with the IMAX 3D version   It might be in IMAX theaters as well   Always wondered this. I know there were a countless number of times when Lucas said no, but were there ever rumors in the 2000s of another movie happening?    Star Wars - Episode 3: Divisions of the [Quagmire](http://imgur.com/YFRz1l3)   The Clone Wars seemed like it could be a title for one of them   Yeah, there's really not much about those that couldn't be canon   I have 3/5, Droids, Clone Wars Volume 1, and the Ewoks movie. Only the Clone Wars, and maybe Droids, are recommended.   I wondered if I should put it on, and I almost left it out, but there are some people out there who seem to like it...   Personally I love Last Crusade the best.  What do you think?   I honestly don't know how I feel. There were as many good moments for me as there were bad. Firstly, I loved the style overall. It had a very Disney-ish feel to it, which helped to bring a sense of wonder and adventure to it. On the other hand, it was probably one of the most cliche movies I've ever seen, and the dialogue was not anything to be proud of.    That's another small step for man, an even greater leap for mankind   The Bridge on the River Kwai   Haha - I think people are on to you   There has never been a time where reading/hearing/seeing Karl hasn't made me laugh out loud   Inspired by /u/JG1991's question   Yeah, I actually think it's the closest in style and tone to the OT   Or the multiple of 2?   Then I don't think you understand what makes Star Wars so good and successful. It's a timeless story with relatable characters, something that a lot of movies in the 70s didn't have. Without it's special effects and wide appeal, we wouldn't have any of the blockbuster movies today.    C'mon dude!   Yeah, I've never understood why that would make it look any better    I agree with you on everything except George Miller emulating the style of Buster Keaton. Not in the slightest. Action-comedy is not what I'd call Mad Max.   Life, um, finds a way...   I think it would be *interesting* (not necessarily good) to see a sequel where all the classic animated characters are struggling in a world where CGI has taken over    Use a YouTube to MP3 downloader for the trailer and cut out that one line   So you'd rather pay extra for something you can accomplish in an easier way?    Iron Man  Comic hero    James Bond  Book character   Not OP, but I thought it was nothing but a typical action movie. Very little was there in terms of story or dialogue.   And it was really only Lucas himself that he saw potential in, not necessarily the movie.   :/   I'm sure they would if a popular/critically acclaimed director were to do it - someone like Spielberg or Nolan (not to be circlejerky or anything)   Personally, I think those movies have lots of redeeming qualities. Special effects are nice, the whole "world building" is cool, Ewan McGregor and Liam Neeson give good performances, and it was interesting to see what was going on in the Star Wars universe before the OT.   It already sort of is, and it's only been out for a little more than a week - I don't think there's anything to worry about    See:  Conquest of the Planet of the Apes   "Sorry, meant to say that"   "Yes"   Well, you can't call something overrated just because there's parts about it that you don't like...   "I really hate the fact that you made me waste the time typing letters into a search engine so I could figure out what you were talking about. I could've used that time to do a lot of other things. I appreciate your comment, but FYI, please try not to ruin my day again."  :/   And Jerry and Elaine and Newman, all rolled up into a neat little package.   The weather isn't consistent in every part of Ireland   Nice username   No offense, but I can tell you from experience that this is not the sub to put text posts with speculation not based on fact    But my uncle *does* work for Disney, and his brother in law JJ (Abrams, that is) says the next trailer will be with Inside Out. Also, Palpatine survives and Jar Jar becomes his apprentice   /s   Never seen it actually - the correct answer is Star Wars V   You should watch the documentary "Behind the Planet of the Apes" if you haven't seen it    No, it was Empire Strikes Back   No   Nope   Nope   Got it!   Here's 5:  1) ... 2) Planet of the Apes 3) Back to the Future 4) Jurassic Park 5) Jaws   Yeah, I figured, but you said *a* Bush, and not just Bush   Well, no matter what you say, it has undeniably had a humongous impact on popular culture and filmmaking as a whole.   They are still quality pieces of hardware and software   	109
 Vicar is a pushover on a level 4 beastbro run, let alone regular character runs.  I think Father G is the only remotely challenging boss out of the first 3 (cleric, father G and Vicar).   Ah.  I remember getting there right after I got the cord from Mergo's wet nurse, and before I even had a chance to inspect the item, I went to Gherman and when he said subit, I thought, I didn't come this far for some geriatric mother-fucker to mercy-kill me.  Bam.  On into NG+, and I was sad because I wasn't finished exploring :D   Update:  Here is the post I mentioned.  It is based off a lot of solid in-game info, as well as concrete info. from the game guide (that often isn't in the game).  Be warned though:  SPOILERS!   https://www.reddit.com/r/bloodborne/comments/33hj91/yharnam_was_never_the_destination_lore_spoilers/   I'll find the link for you later when I get home. And I said MP because I didn't want to spoil anything for you. What ending did you get?   Oooooh. The "up" part was hidden by my phone. That makes more sense, but still, all I can see now is "how to dick your murders." :D   Alls I can make out is "how to dick your murders," but something tells me I am reading that wrong :D   Yeah. I have yet to see a satisfactory explanation of them, or something beyond a brief mention. The best I heard so far that fit within te known/posited lore, is that they were messengers/servants of the MP. The guy who posted it made enough sense, but at the same time, there might have been discrepancies in what he posted and te time-line of events and characters, as there is clear architecture and statues based off the messengers in the labyrinth, and the chalice dungeons definitely predate the city of Yharnam and the current events.    Beast roar can deflect projectiles. Pretty sure nothing else can...   I got invaded while I was wielding the BOM, trying em on for size for the previous micolash boss fight, so I tried them out for that duel and I totally got my ass handed to me. Aside not being used to them in general, the range is shit, and their dodge attacks are pretty easy to avoid.  Should have known better since I have yet to die myself to someone using BoM :D   I just think 20 vials is too many, for PvE and PvP. The max should be 10 or 12 (aside runes), and they should heal for a bit more. 30 makes te game too easy and encourages sloppy play :/   Yep.  She had quite a few new moves.  Bitch went total ape-shit on me, extending her arms and turning everything black and going clone-slut on me etc.   Lots of posts of people confirming that you can, so long as you are in level range as Siam09 mentioned.   I think 'true ending' is what the community dubbed it.  The game calls it "childhood ending."  But yeah.  Pretty awesome.   I've continued to level my original character up to 200, because he is always swimming in millions of echoes, so I just ran with him to be able to play with all the different items and weapons.  I don't play him that much, because I have more fun with focused builds (that sacrafice one thing for another, instead of total maxed out badass) - and once you learn the game, you can run through it super quick to make more focused, lower level builds for multiplayer.  As a result, I have a level 90 STR, level 90 SKL toon, and a level 90 BT toon, and I plan on rounding it out with an arcane build and a quality build (I enjoy the simplicity and serratedness of the saw weapons) :D   The point is, if you level too high, you are cutting yourself off from the larger meta of more dedicated (for lack of a better word) players.   How quickly in game can you turn Ludwig's into an arcane weapon?  Like, what's the earliest arcane gem you can find?  I wanted to make an arcane build, and I heard Ludwig's was one of the best for those.  Also, is Ludwig's better on a quality build?  Thanks.   That game is one of the best ever made.  The 'true' ending reminded me of SoC :D   Hmmm. At a glance, that seems much quicker. What was that?  10-15 seconds total?  Compared to before, which seemed like 40-45 seconds?  Also. Is that a stock HD?  Or a SSD?   Also, what about Laurence?  :D     Also, what about the giant "eyes in the sky" in Old Yharnam?   Hey Icarus.  Thanks again for your post the other day, and thanks for this write-up as well.  I am pressed for time at the moment, but I have one thing to ask about in the meantime, well, several things but all about the same subject - and that is about the messengers.   I think this is the first post I've seen where someone actually talks more about the messengers, at least, one that fits better with all the other lore that is given or posited.  If they are MP's homeboys, why do we see their likeness in the chalice dungeons?  I mean, it seems the messengers predate MP and Gherman, or was MP always around meddling, and Gherman just came later?  Either way, it is quite murky, but very simply, What does that time-line look like?   Also relevant - I like what you posted about the brain.  I feel like the brain and it's eyeball infection has hardly been touched by the community, especially the people who commonly make lore videos.  That being said, what is your opinion on the brain and it's seemingly spreading corruption?  Who are those iron golems, and why are they seemingly tasked with killing off the baby eyeball brains?  At first glance, I though they were spider eggs, as there were giant spiders nearby, and they looked like milky white egg sacks, but then later you see the brain, and the eyeballs growing on everything, and this leaves me to think that these are baby wintern lanterns/brain trusts that are spreading and growing, but why are the golems killing them?  If the brain was created as a form for the great one to inhabit, or whatever else it could be, why are they killing the babies?  Simply trying to control an experiment that got out of hand?  Because it seems like those eyeballs grow into the brain trusts.  And as for the brain trusts, why is their brain matter made out of messengers?  I don't have the time to re-read this and try to figure out where this stands in your facts/speculation write-up, but how do the messengers fit in with the idea that they are MP's servants/messengers, yet they also make up those brains, including the mother brain?  I suppose they could have been kidnapped by Mensis school and used in the experiments/conjuring then?  Would love to hear your thoughts.  Thanks.   Uuuh, what?   Right, but from what I've read on here, the vial and consumable system (namely bullets) makes it hard for new players, and it winds up as double frustration for them, because they need to farm vials period, but they aren't that good at the game, so they then use as many as they farm or just die more.  Same thing with insight.  They run out of insight, often on failed summons, and they don't know how to get more, or can't find more.  Etc.  For veteran FROM fans, I think this game was pretty easy to catch the hang of, but for new players, not so much.  Either way though, it all funnels you towards the direction of 'git guud skrub,' but I totally see how it could turn some people off, but my point remains.  10 vials (with the same runes to increase the numbers, I mean, who the fuck needs 24 or 25 vials?) would mean you don't have 20 vials to burn through each time, and thus would hopefully learn to play more carefully and be more cautious.  I think it would be the best balance between the two, and also, make PvP and PvE in general just more exciting and dangerous :D   Uhhhh, still nope.  I don't see where Brain Trust comes from :D  I don't think I'm being too dense...   I think Blood vials should be limited to 10 or 12 tops, but they should heal for a larger percentage of health.  I feel like once you get the hang of this game, even in chalice 5s and NG++++ and especially for PvP, 20 is just way too many vials, and if anything, I tend to fight and play better the less crutches or healing items I have to lean on.  I feel like having so many just encourages sloppy play, and makes the game too forgiving.   Winter lanterns?  I know that comes from the guide, but that just flat out sounds like a print error, typo, or really bad translation...   Also. Where did the name "brain trust" come from in the first place?  :D   Edit:  But yes. Fuck those things.    Yeah. Hopefully the patch helps, drastically. Otherwise I do worry about the longevity of this game.its hard for me to understand how FROM really fucked up multiplayer so bad, and the loading screens shouldn't just be brushed aside either. Those are some critical errors for them, and I feel like they should have known better or done better.     And I know dark souls 2 was far from perfect, but it was still the best game of 2014, and I'm pretty sure all of us FROM fans had a lot of fun with it and played it more than anything else, which is kind of funny considering how much everyone bitches about it. The point is, B-Team still gets a cookie :)   I think that is just the example that some bosses show up as regular enemies sometimes, like undead giants and what not.    The thing being the MP's dream is a theory, but yes, we do know Ebrietas is a great one, and we do know the other great ones have form - that I am not denying, but it is important to note where these forms exist, as this game pays great attention to details in where and when characters exist.  Ebrietas is the only one that exists in form in the waking/physical world.  The other great ones have form too, but they exist in their respective realities/dreams/realms (Amygdala in Nightmare frontier, the brain and mhergo in nightmare of mensis, etc).  The implied message about the great ones is that they transcended the limitations of their physical bodies (through force of will, like the hunters learned to dodo), and they can clearly alter and affect reality, and that is the sort of power and knowledge that the characters and institutions in this game have been chasing.    I didn't say it was better, and you might be right about that, but there are still some holes to be poked:  the lagstabs and phantom bull-shit has always been a problem with FROM's servers or whatever gerbil-wheel set-up they have going on.   And at least they added the agape ring at pretty much direct requests from players to offset SM in DaS2.  That being said, DaS2 was far less laggy for me than DaS.  DaS had terrible PvP lag for me and imo, and it killed a lot of the fun.  DaS2 was much smoother, and other than hackers, in a zillion games of PvE and PvP, I never had people warping all over the place.   Sure. I always enjoy the lore discussions, whether it's someone teahimg me something, or poking holes in someone else's theories. And I always love that the different interpretations only bring up more and more questions :D   In general, it's to keep you at a certain level to be able to easily interact with the majority of the community. Most people seem to be stickin between levels 75-120 for both PvE and PvP. It also forced you to actually has to pick and choose your item/magic/weapon usage to make for unique characters and fights. If everyone had 50 in every stat, it would make the game a bit droll as you would be over leveled and over powered, whereas with a level cap, you actually have to make some sacrifices for your build to specialize in certain areas.    Ah. Ok. All square here.    Fair point :)   Yeah. The impressions from the game were that all the great ones weren't necessary one happy pantheon of gods, but that they all had their individual motives an desires, and not all of them were created equal. Thanks for the info. Look forward to hearing what else you might be able to add to it.    Dude... the decent damage, the awesome move-set.  The staggers, the range, the sweeps, the knock downs, the long-range R2 followed by a quick R1.... and I just can't put that thing down!  I swear - I tried the rest, but the damage and range of the hammer sucked, and it was way too slow.  Same with the wheel.  Why can't their be any other STR weapon equivelants?!  FOR THE RECORD:  Most of the 2hand damage, and even like, half the 1h damage, comes from blunt damage, not physical.  Check out the post from Icarus with the pictures from the official guide.   But if it were to wind up remotely similar, then NO please :D   Woohooo!  I see my judas priest reccomendation in there :)  Sad Wings of Destiny was fuckin awesome!   Haha. YUP.  Moar coffee and vapes please!   Awww, I know the doll says, "I hope you find your worth in the waking world," implying Yharnam and all that, but she is dumb and naive.  I was really hoping Yharnam was a dream of the great ones, and in a sense, we were trying to wake up the great ones, as the world was them retaining their consciousness throuhg force of will, just like Mensis Nightmare and Micolash, Gherman and the hunter's dream, etc.  Their physical bodies are dead and/or gone, but they are still alive on a different plane of existence.  Ok.  This makes it a little less interesting :/   Umm, no, we don't need an alternative to the OP ridiculous bug of the rifle spear (great weapon, the bug aside).  I don't think the Reiter's bullets not scaling with arcane is a mistake.  I think the Rifle Spear's ridiculous damage is a mistake/bug.   Actually, I think the doll is just a construct, but due to her coy and aloof nature, she comes off as aloof, almost as if she knows more than she lets on, but in reality she really is quite simple and naive...  fun speculation though :D   Edit:  based on what others with the guide say that the guide says, aside the doll's obvious nature (as she even says she was created by humans, and seemingly is quite simple)   Wow.  Crzy to see that my high % +physical gems are nearly useless, or rather, only effective seemingly less than half the time in the axe...  Ok, I'm definately going to have to buy this book!   Yeah, it was pretty disturbing when you find mild-mannered Alfred post ape-shit status, covered in gore, and so entrenched in his violence, that he hardly even recognizes or cares to see you, the player character :D   I'm fan enough, and I enjoy all things Bloodborne, so I likely will.  Apparently it is hard copy on Amazon for 25 bucks or so?  That sounds like one hell of a deal!   Bingo.  He is hiding the rituals from sight, or from being completed.  In turn, Rom is also keeping the cultists/servants from their master (the great one(s) ).  It even says "ritual seal" broken when you kill Rom, which fulfills the note you first see in Yahr Guhl (sp) of "madmen work in madness to bring about more madness rituals," or whatever.   Ah ok, so it isn't that he wants the ritual to be completed (via breaking the seal by killing Rom), he wants you to stop the WHOLE ordeal, not just the small portion that Rom is scrambling or blocking?   Edit:  Speaking of which - is there any more info on Rom?  How he got there, or who or what he is?    Or how he became to be the seal that blocks the cultist's rituals?  I firmly believe (ed) that he is not human and never was.      But they're so cute!   So, is this from the Bloodborne Collector's Edition Strategy Guide by Future Press?  Thanks.   Hmmm, this sort of hints at my thoughts that the brain was indeed a great one (as descibed in game), but he was more or less thought into being somewhere between the other great ones wills, Micolash, the Mensis School, and the age old adage of wanting to "grow eyes on the mind."   Dude.  I thoroughly enjoyed your post, but how does anyone play Destiny for more than two or three hours tops?  I mean, I get it, the compulsion to play grindy games often lasts longer than the fun, but the decent graphics and run-of-the-mill yet tight shooter mechanics weren't even remotely redeeming of the fact that it was completely unimaginative, generic, had no intrigueing characters or plot points, the voice acting was terrible, it had mediocre gameplay, and by mission 2 or 3, they were already recycling the same maps...   Ahem.  Sorry, I just really hate that game and how shitty it was, and how everyone rushed out to buy such a polished hype-turd.  And to this  day, I'm still baffled that anyone can stomach it :D   Punished for failing to learn?  But that is how life is, and how it should be, and it is a shame there are so many stupid people out there not being punished as much as they probably deserve.  But it is such a great parallel to existense itself - art imitating life really :D   I use the opposite strategy to avoid her, be it in NG+++, or chalice dungeons.  If I lock on her, I can't see when to start running to avoid the one-shot lasers, as trying to roll or dodge stops me for a split second, and I get zapped.  I know they make noises, but I'm usually too stressed to  figure that out in those moments.  I've subsequently locked her down to where I can kill her in one attempt every time, even on new characters, but man oh man, trying not to die in that last phase the first time fighting her was brutal    Yes.  There are a lot of gaps to fill, but so far, it would seem that we don't even know what the real world is anymore.  The only way to wake up the moon presence is by our will becoming powerful enough that we can retain consciousness upon death (the way gherman, micolash, and the other great ones do, even after permanent death of the body), and the only way we can do this is by killing Gherman himself, and this only results in slavery to the MP because we do not have the insight to know that the MP is is there orchestrating this blood-orgy and fucking with us.  After having the necessary insight through the umbilical cords themselves (seemingly the blue-print of evolution and the 'how to' of becoming a great one') we begin to see through the dreams, and then we finally arise to front and center stage of the brutal shit-show of the MP's nightmare realm, and we get the MP's attention.  The MP still wants to make us a thrall to his will and his dream, but we say, *"not today bitch, we know better,"* and when we finally kill it, we become the new Chief Asshole and somehow usher humanity forward into a new age of it's Baby Squid-Monster Overlord...    It still wound up making quicker and easier multiplayer connections, be it for PvE or PvP :/   Gotcha.  Thanks.  Did some more reading up on the original post and the updates and comments and I see what they mean.  Hopefully these odds and ends get fixed sooner rather than later.   Gotcha.  I remember seeing the original post a few days ago.  Just read up on the updates and the comments, and I see what you guys mean now.  Thanks Atrophy and Vividos.   Dude.  I loved the rifle spear in PvE (talking regular use, not arcane exploit), even though the damage was relatively weak for the first half of the game.  The weapon is fun, and it comes with a lot of reach and versatility.  The build I was using it on was switched to BT (I was just using the rifle-spear cuz I hated the cane), and I was hoping to make a dedicated PvE/PvP rifle spear build just because it was one of the most fun weapons I've played with, but I suppose I'd rather wait till this arcane rifle spear stuff blows over as well :/   I don't believe MP and Oedeon are one in the same myself, but see my above post, as we technically don't see the MP in the "physical world" either (if one even exists in game).  We only encounter the MP in Gherman's dream, and I believe the rest of the game is the MP's dream, hence we are trying to transcend it by waking it up, and refusing to become its thrall.   Not that the MP is clearly defined, but Odeon is more clearly defined, as he is described as the formless Great One who exists only in thoughts or words or whatever, which is where the Caryll runes come from.  The MP clearly has a physical form, though we only see it in Gherman's dream, which might mean it has no physical form either, as it supports the idea that the Great One's ascencion is them leaving there physical bodies behind, which is supported by the fact that Ebrietas, the great one that was explicitly described as "being left behind" and "abandoned," is the only one we see in the waking or physical world, which might be a great one's dream in the first place, because the whole game is a series of character's wills forcing them to retain their consciousness, ie., Gherman's Dream, Micolash's dreams (whose dead body we actually see after The One Reborn) and so forth, and it seems our character's true mission is to wake the great ones from their dreams, so we can transcend it.  I believe the waking world (as the Doll implies) is the MP's (a great one's) dream, and I do not believe him and Oedeon are one in the same.  Oedeon is just one of the former great ones that has ascended and left the physical realms behind, and has never been seen in a dream, be it his or someone else's.   How do we know that you're not supposed to be able to?  Does arcane not apply to the reittersplash then?  And accidentally apply to the rifle spear?  Thanks.   Dude.  I missed the charred set on my first toon my first time around, But I absolutely fucking love the full charred armor set with the top hat!     Well, it partially summons her, as in, it shoots out her tentacles.  Other in-game item descriptions relating to the choir tell us Ebrietas was a great one that was left behind.  It seems they use strong language either way in saying "abandoned" and "left behind."  Maybe she wasn't strong enough to transcend her physical body like the other great ones seemingly did?   Oedeon:  *"Should we bring Ebrietas with us when we leave?"*   Moon Presence:  *"Shhhhhh!  No dude!  She stands like, right in your face when she speaks to you.  Seriously, doesn't she have any concept of personal space?  Let's just leave her behind."*   Item descriptions say she is a great one, and that she "was left behind."  My guess based off lore is that the great ones were able to transcend their physical bodies (in the same way in-game items tell us hunters can retain their consciousness through sheer force of will, ie., like gherman and his dream, or dead micolash and him as host of the nightmare).  The schools and church and players in game are trying to transcend the physical world it seems, transcend the realites in front of them, and it seems the hunter exists in gherman's dream, and he is trying to wake the current great one (the moon prescence) up from its dream... but it all only brings up more questions.   But between the choir garb and other in-game item descriptions, the game flat out tells us that Ebrietas is indeed a Great One, and that she was left behind, left-behind being the real question as to what it means.  Did the other ones ascend?  They seem to not exist in the physical realm, and only exist in mind and dreams and other realms of existence.  Why was Ebrietas left behind?  Etc?   How is it that it winds up so kerplow-powerful?  The flat arcane damage gets applied to each pellet and is thus more powered than a % gem could make it?  I loved playing with the rifle spear (regular gem slots, didn't know how OP it could be) in the PvE game on my skill build (since I hated the cane) until I went for Evylyn/Chikage.  I wanted to make a build around the weapon because it was so much fun, though the damage was a bit lacking - but I don't want to make a build around this since it will likely be patched out..    Is it really a glitch though?  I just thought it was OP mechanics the way the arcane rifle spear turns out?   Welcome to Camera Souls, where the hardest enemy you will ever fight is ultimately, THE CAMERA!   YOU DIED!   The brain is a great one that was found/created in the nightmare (see the description of living string item). The first eyeball growths you see are dead and covered in a milky white film, hence I said I and others mistook them for spider eggs, especially with the appendages that look like they are coming out of eggs. Later, in the area of mother brain, you can clearly see they are eyeballs growing on everything, which is seemingly what happens if it is left unchecked. The question is, what are they, why are they growing, and who are the little iron golems and why are they seemingly trying to poke out all the eyeballs?   Mother Brain and her scourge of eyeballs that are over-running the Nightmare of Mensis.  The first time through that area, we see those pale, milky white sacks covering various parts of the level and the mansion where Micolash resides.  At a glance, I thought they were spider eggs, after all, there seem to be legs growing out of many of them, and there is a giant spider and her spiderlings nearby.  It all seemed simple enough.  From there, you observe the little iron golem men in the mansion strolling around, as if they are tasked to destroy these eggs, since the eggs have arrows/spikes jabbed through them.  It isn't until you find the hidden area with Mother Brain that you see that they aren't innocuous little sacks of spider eggs, but actual eyeballs, as if the brain is replicating, or spreading some sort of disease or curse or who knows what.  Those are the obvious ideas behind it (the mother brain spreading her rottenness), but I was curious what other people's ideas and opinions and speculations were about this area and how it relates to Mother Brain, the iron golems, and the spreading eyeball scourge.  It's almost like the opposite of much of the rest of the game, where the characters and enemies willingly blindfold or blind themselves to keep from seeing what is before them.  I look forward to your replies.  Thanks.   They don't scale.  Sure, the first crows you meet in game don't have as many HP as the same crow enemies later on in the game, but they are just adjusted to general game progression.  They don't slide along with your direct leveling/gameplay.   Dude.  Charred Hunter's set is pimp!  So much Heavy-Metal-Dracula-Bad-Ass hunter goodness.  Looks great with the Top Hat, and so many other things!   Great One***, not Old One  :D    You are new to the Souls games huh?  Yes.  You are doing exactly what you need to be doing, and you are exactly where you need to be.  Do not look up spoilers or info or help.  Slug it out and play blind through one of video gaming's most unique experiences :D   For pretty much the entire game, including the weak ass final (or near final) boss :D   I think this game was the easiest, because a lot of us players knew what to look for and expect from a FROM game.  Once upon a time, stumbling upon a black knight as a newb in Dark Souls got you wreckt, but now you can go fight it no problem, or even beat the game as a onebro.  Remember, this game and its mechanics and brutality are new to a lot of people.  Sure, even for longer term Souls players it takes some time to learn the new combat system, but once you get that down, it is essentially more of the same.  Try to imagine playing DeS or DaS or BB for the first time, or as your first FROM game.  That being said, I agree.  The Chikage hunter in the Grand Cathedral is harder than pretty much all the bosses in the game.   That was all speculation and hype.   I think they should have just kept the tried and true summoning sign method, and to keep with the theme, instead of little runic signs via soapstones, it could have just been your messengers sitting there, rining the bells for you.   Traded in DaS1 and 2?  I get it, the games aren't for everyone.  Go play CoD  :P   TIL That everyone hates the books they were forced to read in high school.  That, and a lot of people don't understand literature, or its significance in history...  Not everyone is meant to or likes to read.  Go back to watching TV.   There are a lot of ignorant people here.  BRING ON THE DOWN VOTES! :D   A lot of people had mentioned it and continue to mention it, but it was far more original and it pushed the bar for its time, though other authors who remain unpopular or unheard of had done it better decades before Salinger, so yeah, fuck that book, but hey, it set the bar for generations of self-absorbed navel-gazers to come!   But it set the bar for generations of self-absorbed navel-gazers to follow!  It's like, the thing to do!   Longer reply:  I didn't mean to dismiss micolash'd blatherings, since as you said, insight is madness in this game, but another key thing he says is "the lake is mud," or something like that, implying how Rom hides or hinders the rituals the church is trying to work, hence he has the title vacuous. It answers the question of why Wilhem hid him  - Rom is there to be a scrambler to the church. Something about him/her/it hides/hinders the church's workings. The church knows Wilhem is at odds with them, and they sent a hunter in choir garb to keep watch on him - hunter who even uses the auger of Ebriatis, the great one that was left behind, the great one the church found, and the only great one that actually exists in the physical (or dreaming or waking?) world.    Also. Every other human in bloodborne gets a lot of screen time, dialogue, or descriptions in the game via items or notes, yet there is none at all tht mention rom except those that reference te bergynwyrth spider. I don't believe this is incidental, accidental, or intentional. There is no mention of Rom the human, because he never was human.  The implication is that rom is somehow kin (yes, great one blood is an item in game, and we get none from rom), and an interpretation of what Micolash says is akin to Jenny in forest gump, when she says, "dear god, make me as a bird so I can fly far away."  She doesn't actually expect to be turned into a bird, or that birds were other entries that were just one day slapped with the gift of wings. She just wants their ability. There is no concrete evidence in what Micolash says to make it truly lean one way or the other, but based on all the evidence in game, and the fact that Rom the human is never mentioned, I happen to believe Micolash just meant what he said about rom as, "I want what he has."  Nothing more, nothing less.    And still, this only brings up more questions of "who, what, when and why?"  Your thoughts?   :)   Quick reply: I thought the same thing, until I found "great one blood" in a chalice dungeon, and thought, 'holy shit. That's a big difference'. Worth noting, great one blood (at least in coldblood form) is not pale.    Will read and write more later.    And this hiding keeps it from coming to fruition by blocking people's perceptions?  Hence the title vacuous?   Dude. I hated the blunderbuss too. It seemed do much more clunky and harder to use than pistols :/   I thought vacuous was somehow relate to how Rom is sort of like a signal scrambler, somehow keeping the cultist's rituals from working. He ce, once you kill him, the ritual in the unseen village is completed successfully, everyone is killed and the one reborn is...reborn. This is supported by the notes, "the spider keeps all manner if rituals from us."  As well as, "The Byrgynwyrth spider keeps our master from us."  The spider is rom, and the master is the one reborn or the kin or the great ones themselves or whatever, not Wilhem as a lot of people presume. This could furthermore support the Wilhem being at direct odds with te churh, hence e summoned Rom, though a lot of the details are still missing.    Worth noting, a lot of people think Rom was a person turned into a weird creature, but there is nothing in game at all to support this. I think Rom is kin, he ce we get kin blood and not great one blood from him. People like to reference micolash'd dialogue, but that is the ranting of a madman, and saying "give us eyes as you have Rom," doesn't mean Rom was born as a human and later gifted with eyes. It can just as well mean he was simply born/created that way, and Micolash says "give us eyes like rom" just like a child might say "I want wings like the birds so I can fly"   There's another idea I have that I have yet to see be discussed - and that is the brain that is covered in eyes, which in game it is directly called a great one, and the point is, with all the lines between humanity and our base nature and dreams and reality being blurred, was the brain found?  Or was it forged through the yearnings and experiments of mensis and wilhem's sayings "line our brains with eyes."  Very simply, was the brain basically "thought" into existence through the nightmare, the great ones, and the wills of those working on te crazy experiments?   Not all the chalice merchants are. I remember one or some of the others in a dead end room that was an offshoot of one of the paths.    Right. And it took me awhile to figure those tougher enemies out. I honestly think FROM put them there to crush the player and their spirit, because new players just cant or wont stan a chance asindt them, andeven with good equipment those enemies can own you if you underestimate them, but I think they are there so that when you come back to kill them, you can really see how much better you have become as a player :D   I got ya though.  Like Hellkite drake?  Or black Knights?  I mean, even then, Hellkite drake was definitely not meant to be killed right away, and Onebro stuff is when you have already become pro enough at the game and you need a challenge, but you're absolutely right.  There are no real "HOLY SHIT" moments of, *'that guy fucking stomped me, and I would have never in a million years beat him my first go or anywhere near it.'*     But, aren't you looking at this from the perspective of a vetted FROM fan?  What about the people new to the series who took days or weeks to kill the first two bosses?  I bet those executioner's were about as hard as black knights were back in the day, wouldn't you think?   I mean, we've also come to expect this from them, so I think the player base has just gotten better at playing FROM's games as well, and they know what to expect, and it is hard to recapture those previous moments of "holy jebus who was that that just stomped me!?"   You know, big poisonous blood monsters that make you sick?   Judas Priest - The Ripper   Pendant in its usefulness, but I think iris there to cement the lore. The whole the great ones and hunters and etc can retain their consciousness trough force of will, even if there bodies are dead.    You know that's not the Blood Letting Beast that everyone complains about as hard, right?  :P   What a bunch of assholes.  Tell them to go play CoD if they are going to complain about what has been an excellent staple since the beginning of FROM's game design.  It adds a nice touch of needed variety and excitement and exploration.  I'd love to see more Sen's fortresses and Cainhurst's and traps and AIDS monsters!   Yeah.  The worst part of Cainhurst is how short it is, though the excellent level design in general of BB really hides how short and linear the game actually is :/   What was your poison resist at?  My level 4 bro couldn't do the last phase of that fight without getting herpes, cuz that fucker just looks at me and BAM, I get bloodbeast AIDS and my HP starts dropping like dead hookers in my basement, and I gotta use an antidote cuz that shit is super powerful.  Even with chucking molotovs and blood lure potions, that fucker still moves to fast and is on me giving me the beast herp before I can even tap the dodge button.   "Oh look (Gherman), you found yourself a (another) hunter."   "May you find your worth in the waking (dreaming) world."   Haha.  At first I thought, "Look, those crows think they are dogs!" and later I was all like, "Holy shit, those dogs fucked those crows!"   That, and I thought it was some sort of bad Japanese to English transition, like, somehow, Miyazaki thought crows barked in English speaking countries :D   Why would anyone use a cannon for PvE?  I mean, other guns and weapons are far more versatile and useful, and they don't take such a large stat investment and use half of a precious resource in one shot :D   My only suggestion is using pistol for parry and visceral ing him to death. You just need the patience and the practice. I haven't gotten to him yet on my level 4 beast bro, but the plan is to parry+charge or strong attack, since level 4 viscerals don't do shit for damage.    Lots of lower tier rune, 2 blood stone chunks, and a lot of other bloodstone upgrades.  Coming here ASAP was indispensable for my level 4 beastbro  :D   For low stat characters?  Yes, for sure.  Beastbro uses an axe though, because I hate the cane, and the axe is badass and has an indispensalbe moveset and good crowd control.  I just use the % ones for now, because I have never really seen a worthwhile flat damage gem outside of a chalice dungeon IIRC  :D   I've gotten quite a few at random off rats, but why do you need to farm for them?  In following standard dungeon progression, and thoroughly exploring those and the later root chalices you create for loot, you should have more than enough crafting materials to make a few top tier dungeons at any given time.   You can run in tighter circles though and make it proc quicker, so yes, it is faster to a point.  Or you can walk around the table and have it proc once on each side, or run it in a tight circle and get it to proc quicker.   My guess is they are as close as it gets to "raw" upgrades in previous souls games, whereas, a nice flat damage bonus to a weapon would be worth more to a low stat character than a +%scaling weapon.  For example, my Level 4 beastbro would probably get more out of a gem with a flat 20-40 damage, rather than +15-20%, since his STR and SKL are like, 8 or 9 each, though, I haven't gotten any worthwhile flat damage gems yet in game to compare the differnces, as the really good ones are hard to get.  	105
 no its reference to a song   That font for the logo sucks, I've thought so since the first video. It's too amateur.  Other than that, pretty good video.   Pretty hot.   what's gg stand for in this context      catastrophe   Barry marries Iris and not him.   Belgian   This trailer... sucks.   Hot.. but can you really call this a Harley Quinn cosplay?   And we act like law enforcement still isn't doing this.  Is the scariest thing.   There's literally no actual evidence of that.   Yeah, he didn't.... my other co-workers recommended that I stopped giving him rides since, well first - he lives very far and he's a pretty ungrateful guy.  I gotta learn to start saying no to people without having a guilty conscience. I'll try to learn from this expensive lesson.  Thank you.   Really?   What is?   Can someone explain to me what's so terrible about Brazil?   Cung Le v. Bisping  Le still pushed forward and unleashed a flurry of attacks before he succumbed to his eye injuries and blindness.   This thread...   ...and it's taken her 5 years to do that? Pretty sure the Disney image went away as soon as she took that first bong hit of Salvia and shaved her head.   Am I a bad person?   Yeah, I agree. Would it make any sense to ask for the gas money that he bailed out on giving repeatedly in the past?    17 over. Is it worth mentioning that he lived 25 minutes away?   Well, he was pretty far from my current location at the time.  His work place was near where I was and he lived 25 minutes away. So going the limit would take 50 minutes to get him to work which he would then have to change out and what not which would make him late. I think that's worth mentioning.   So, I was in the middle of an errand when my friend texted me saying he needed a ride to work. Finished my errand at 10:10 and he has to clock in at work at 11:00 so I immediately drove to his house. He told me to step on it so he won't be late and, stupidly, I did and I ended up getting a speeding ticket. I figured he would be understanding and feel bad and offer to help me out when I got to his house and told him (Stupid me) but he just shook it off and practically said, "tough luck, bud." What pissed me off the most was right after, he had the audacity to tell me to hurry so he won't be late. Ended up getting to him to work in time.   Ticket came home to be $367 and I'm falling very short as I just paid for my classes for next semester. tl;dr:   -Friend Asked for a Ride to Work, I agreed   -He told me to step on it, I got a speeding ticket   -He had the audacity to tell me to hurry RIGHT AFTER I got a ticket so he wouldn't be late to work. Also, he didn't even pay for gas...   -Got him to work on time at the cost of $367.   -Would it be okay for me to ask him to help pay for it? If so, what should I say?   I was just trying to help him out and I paid the consequences for doing so. I know. I'm not saying it's not my fault.   50 MPH, I was going 17 over.  My friend also lives 25 minutes away from where I was at the time and it would've taken us the same amount of time to get to his workplace.     Yeah, you're right. I guess I just felt rushed at the moment and didn't want him to get in trouble at work. I'm not saying it's not my fault, though.   It wouldn't be reasonable at all? :/  And I was just trying to help him the entire time.   Doing some community service early in the morning.   Even if you specifically told them to step on it?   I'm not asking him to pay for all of it.  But he skipped out on giving me gas money for giving him rides several times in the midst of my own schedule and it would be *very nice* of him to chip in to some degree.   So, I was in the middle of an errand when my friend texted me saying he needed a ride to work. Finished my errand at 10:10 and he has to clock in at work at 11:00 so I immediately drove to his house. He told me to step on it so he won't be late and, stupidly, I did and I ended up getting a speeding ticket. I figured he would be understanding and feel bad and offer to help me out when I got to his house and told him (Stupid me) but he just shook it off and practically said, "tough luck, bud." What pissed me off the most was right after, he had the audacity to tell me to hurry so he won't be late. Ended up getting to him to work in time.

I see him at work in a few hours and he is moving soon.      So will getting accepted in medical school be more difficult, than it already is, if you're Asian?   How different can a Green Arrow costume be from "The Arrow" costume? They're both green.   Not very covert, though. IMO.   Do you think he planned to end up as the Demon's Head?   We saw her in the living in one of the promos leading up to the finale.   Where did she stutter on "b-but" Oliver?  The actual dialogue went:  "...thousands of people in this city will die."  "What? No. Ray! Oliver!!!"   Anyone else also think it's bullshit they killed off Sara in the first episode?   Tell me, do you even die? *You will*.   No, not Core-ah; Care-ah.   Same reason Spectacular Spider-Man was killed off.   it shrinks to fit duh   I thought it was Care-ah not Car-ah   time mark?   Does anyone else feel like this is the easy way out? Kind of clich.   I want a twist.   Hey, /r/advice, I was really hoping you guys could help me out. I've been stressed out lately trying to deal with my mother.   Let me give some background info before jumping into it, first. I'm an 18 year guy and until recently have never had a girlfriend or anything close. In High School I was kind of shy and socially awkward when it came to talking to girls. It doesn't help that my parents come from a foreign country and how they think that "getting good grades in class" equates to getting girls to like me. So... yeah.   Anyways, I decided to make a change ever since I started college last fall. I've acted more confident, got a job, started making new friends and talking to girls. Oh yeah, I've never really had many close friends. Never hung out with anyone much because I wanted to avoid having anyone over in fear of my mom's awkwardness. (I brought one friend, who was a guy, over one time and she kept peeking in for whatever reason all awkwardly when we were hanging out in the living room)   So yeah. Lately, I've been bringing friends over to the house to study and hang out afterwards - usually in my room but sometimes on the dinner table too if we both need extra space for our assignments, books, and what not. Surprisingly, my parents were cool with it. They haven't barged in or anything like that or bothered us at all. It's like I'm having a social life for the first time in my life and, to be honest, I really like it. I've spent most of my teenage years shut in my room and browsing the internet and it's been kind of lonely to be honest. So, I don't know how it happened but I somehow convinced a girl to give me a chance to take her out for a date. We had a great time and I've been seeing her a lot lately. Never really talked to my parents about her but we've been going out on dates frequently and, honestly, I like her a lot.   About two weeks while we were hanging out after classes - we were talking about the new Furious 7 movie, I talked about asking her to come over to watch a Fast   Furious marathon with me before we go see the movie in theaters together. She said she'd be down to come over right then since she didn't have plans for the rest of the day. I texted my parents I was having a friend over and when she came over I introduced her to them. Afterwards I took her to my room and set up the movie and I left to use the restroom. When I got back I noticed my mom talking to her and then left right before I got back to my room. I asked her what my mom said and she said that my mom asked if we wanted to hang out in the living room. In my head I'm like, "what the heck, mom?" Way to put her on the spot.   So during the first movie, my mom knocked on the door and told me it wasn't good for my friend to be over this late and I told her that my friend's own mother was fine with it since she (my friend) told her parents before she decided to swing by.   Anyways, we went through the first movie and got halfway through the second before one thing led to another and we ended up having sex. Afterward, I checked the time and it was still pretty early (About 8:30ish) and I took her home so my parents wouldn't complain and so her own parents wouldn't worry. My friend's mom was really impressed I cared about her that much.   Next morning I have a talk with my mom about last night and, surprisingly, she acted very calm about it. She said everything that I'm doing is perfectly normal for an 18 year old (btw my mom's a nurse) and she just pointed out to make sure we were having protected sex if we decided to do it. Awesome, right?   A couple days later after I brought her over again to study and hangout. Of course, I told my parents before doing so. She came over and we were hanging out in the living room with the movie on and me doing my assignment. After awhile I finished my assignment and noticed how uncomfortable she looked - just hanging out on the floor. I asked her if she just wanted to go hang out in my room since she looked like she was having trouble getting comfortable by lying in a bunch of weird positions lol. So we went back to my room and just watched the movie there. About 15 minutes in I get a call from my dad saying that mom wants to talk to me so I excuse myself and go over to my parents room and my mom was absolutely furious that I took her back to my room?   She was mad that I told her we were going to study and went to my room but... I told my mom I finished the assignment. Also, it's not like we couldn't study inside my room, right? Anyways she threw a fit and demanded she get out of my room so I decided to just leave the house with my friend... When I got back - my mom was arguing with my dad about the whole situation.   Since then I've only been allowed to bring her over if we go to the living room and even when I do my mom is extremely irritated about it. Last time I brought her over, when we walked through the front doors - my friend greeted my mom and my mom just pointed to the living room while saying, "I know what's best for you (my name here)."   It's been like this ever since and it's destroying my relationship with this girl. I don't like bringing her over anymore because there's an awkward tension in the household and it sucks because I can't go over to her house either (for temporary reasons I shouldn't disclose). Because of this when we do hang out we usually go out to eat which sucks because we have to spend money over and over if we want a nice indoors place to see each other.   I've had several male friends over since to study for finals with and my parents haven't said anything but my mom freaks out and throws a huge fit which irritates the hell out of my dad because she will bitch at him for not being able to "control his son."   So, finally I had enough and confronted my mom about this and asked her why it was okay for me to bring guys into my room yet I can't bring a girl into my room. I explained that I thought it was because my mom believed we would be constantly having sex. I also pointed out that, like I said earlier, my mother was fine with that. Anyways... my mom just wouldn't give me a reason other than "I know what's best for you." She also pointed out that she hates me having people over. (Which is clearly a lie because she never says anything when guys are over) So yeah, no explanation - no nothing.   Please help me. I've had a taste of what having a social life felt like and it was great. I don't want my mother to ruin this for me.   "ok bruce, first step. Im gonna shot your parents while you watch"    *gonna shot*  Wow.     The Director, who is also middle-eastern, did.   Clark Kent.  EDIT: Foster Parents.   Defeats 2 LOA members but gets taken down by a Petty Thief.   A speed mirage, if you will.   link to original image?   I know, that wasn't what I was asking though :/   Thoughts, opinions?   Wouldn't make sense for there to be two Red Archers in this particular show, imo.   Thea is Arsenal now. Makes sense because in the comics, Speedy becomes Arsenal.   Damn, that feels like so long ago.   To move the plot forward for Speedy (Thea) to become Arsenal. This is why Flash writers  Arrow writers.   swerve?   Hey, /r/legaladvice, I'm in a predicament right now and I was hoping you guys could help. I got a speeding ticket a month ago and I got the okay to do traffic school and work the point off my record. Unfortunately, I just got in another one today (got peer-pressured into going fast to give my friend a lift to work). I told the officer my situation and he seemed considerate   offered to ask for a reduction for me. Unfortunately, I still got a ticket.   However, I explained the fact that I hadn't yet done my traffic school yet for the first ticket and I'm still within the 60 day deadline (or so, it ends on the 22nd of May). He told me that I should try to *"cheat the system"* and though I'm *"not supposed"* (he kept repeating it) to, he recommended that I put traffic school for the first ticket on hold  , since I don't yet have the "traffic school completion" on my record yet, that I should request traffic school again since the 18 month delay between traffic school eligibility hasn't been set.   There's no guarantee it'd work, but he says if it does that I could potentially get both points off my record. The whole thing seems sketchy to me but I figured the most I could lose out of it was 1 point and the most I could benefit by trying is having no points at all. Also, the officer offered to ask for a reduction for me when I show up to court but I was planning on showing up earlier than the deadline date so I could still request traffic school - and if happen to get it, I could finish both before the deadline for my first traffic school ticket expires. I'm not sure how that would work though, would I have to contact him to let him know ahead? I got his name on my ticket but I believe that was about it.   Honestly, I'm more worried about the points though.   Hopefully, that wasn't at all confusing   you guys could offer some advice. Thanks a lot, guys :)   One last thing, what I've learned out of this is that you have to weigh the pros and cons of speeding. If speeding a couple minutes off getting to your destination is worth a couple hundred dollars in tickets and a thousand in insurance bumps is worth it - than by all means, go ahead. But, more than likely, most of the time you're better off going the limit and driving safe. For me, I should've done the latter for both situations.  Also... I just don't understand why he'd offer me to advice on how to cheat the system after giving me a ticket.  Quotas?    Can you get any money from this?   Do they not lock the doors while the Flash is hanging about?   Someone should make Mayweather read this.   So I didn't have time to comment earlier but after reviewing your video again I think you definitely deserve a lot more.  In my opinion, you displayed much more technical skill than your opponent.  As someone who has also had experience fighting against higher belts that're much bigger, this trait is a necessity in order to win as you must outsmart/skill your opponent to make up for any size/strength disadvantages.    You have great technique when it came to your Tornado Kicks, but like I said earlier - you must focus on baiting your opponent out in order for a kick like that to land, especially a kick like that.  Offensive Spinning Kicks have a much lower accuracy than counter-offensive.  Improving your footwork will also help you bait out your opponent.    You took a lot more valid hits than he did - not because he's necessarily better, but you took some illegal hits earlier which affected your game and that you seemed to be waiting for an opening.   Watch the boundaries, try not to step out of the mat.  Impose your will over your opponent rather than the other way around so if he pushes forward, you push right back with a forward attack or a counter instead of just backing up.  You want to be more dominant than he is.    With all that said, I just want to commend you for a great first fight and I encourage you to keep training hard and compete.  I see your spirit in the ring and if you keep at it - you will be great.  Thank you for sharing your experience with us. :)   Great Spin Kicks.  Work on baiting and you'll be landing and scoring those more often.   Plot Twist: That guy kicks as hard as Superman.   Thank you based god.   Beards don't impress women? I hear about women complimenting beards and shaming mustaches all the time via social media.   Pretty much this.   The Hangover Part 2.      He's so fake.   A "good" cop tells, for lack of a better word, on a "bad" cop and all of the other bad cops can intimidate that cop and his family.   That's what happened to Jim Gordon in Batman: Year One.  Jim Gordon was one of the few good cops in a corrupt department and he was ambushed and beat up for trying to do the right thing.  The corrupt officers also threatened his pregnant wife.  EDIT: This is the reason why we need a Batman.   Why do they?   NOS as in Nitrous Oxide System?   Nice rhyming!!!!!!   Thanks for killing it for us.   What episode was this!???   Did Eobard watch Iris and Eddie have sex on one of those surveillance cams?      That site took forever to load.   Is it just me or does the site not have the video anymore?   Holy shit, my current TKD Dojang is $75 a month.   Thank you for the explanation.   So what would a Spinning Back Kick be described as in Karate?   We should ask Chris Weidman for lessons on checking leg kicks.   That was a Spinning Hook Kick.  I don't understand why people mix these kicks up.  A Back Kick travels in a straight line.  It's like confusing a cross with a hook.   Did California really end affirmative action? How recent ago was this?   How the fuck did these dumbasses get into UC Berkeley?   Whoa, that's really clever. Thank you for your kind explanation, /u/ShaneFromaggio   Charlie Puth was just a guy they found off of YouTube and wasn't very well known.  But damn the guy has some talent.  Millions of people have downloaded the single and he's only 23 sitting at the #1 charts for six different countries including the U.S.   had two certificates one from the TKD association of Australia and Kukkiwon the head of wtf taekwondo.  Respect.  Keep training.   LMAO   Seven Eight Nine. Only Revealed Punchline Of One Pun.   i don't understand. can someone explain?   This was posted a week ago.   Could it be useful or is it too slow/situational/etc.?      ok, assume we whack a hammer on my hand vs lay something on it that has the same lbs as a hammer after calculating the force of the swing with the weight of the hammer. Would it both feel the same?    Nah, not consistent. Amazing Spider-Man 2 was so trash that they're going to reboot the series a third time.   Thank you for the explanation and the example.   But "lbs of force" as a force unit and "lbs" as a unit of mass can be equal if they both weigh in at the same number, right?   If someone can kick at "3,000 lbs of force" would that be the same as saying their kick weighs in at 3,000 lbs?   Early 2000's? Spider-Man was pretty good.   DAE hate when they get a cart that won't steer straight and keeps moving to the left/right?   The dumb character design for the Robin girl killed it for me along with the whole generic Mutant Gang.  But yeah, I agree the story is good but the actual details were lacking imo.  Hopefully Dawn of Justice is a lot more entertaining and draws me into the story.  Haven't had a DC Movie glue my eyes to the screen since The Dark Knight.   TOUCAN SAM    WHAT THE HELL. I POSTED THE SAME QUESTION AN HOUR EARLIER AND IT GOT REMOVED http://www.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/3309px/regarding_the_new_batman_v_superman_movie/   Just finished watching both parts of the movie adaptation of TDKR.  it was alright...   Speedforce.   He wore the mech suit throughout the story?  Which book?      Will he be wearing the mech suit throughout the movie? I prefer the classic Batman costume.   I'm guessing the mech suit is just to fight Superman?   Will he be wearing the mech suit throughout the movie? I prefer the classic Batman costume.   I'm guessing the mech suit is just to fight Superman?   lol its slanted   thats racist.   what's that mean?   Uhm... Karate, Judo, BJJ, and JJJ also wear a Gi to fight in competition.   Grant Gustin seems a bit shorter than Stephen Amell.  However, imbd lists Gustin as an inch taller than Amell.    It drove him insane when he found out he was fated to become his arch nemesis  I mean, with that knowledge he could've just rationally altered history by making his decision to *not* become the Flash's arch nemesis.   It's traditional to wear the White, formal "Gi/Dobok" to fight in competition.   American Karate: Rednecks.  Damn. This has gotta be the most honest statement in all of /r/martialarts.   Karate Gi's and Taekwondo Doboks, compared to Judo/JJJ/BJJ Gi's, are made of thin material for a good "snap" sound whenever you punch or kick.  Because of this, if you try to grapple with them - they'll tear.  Judo/JJJ/BJJ Gi's are designed to take a beating with them being pulled and tugged for throws, submissions and what not so therefore, they are weaved much thicker than Karate/Taekwondo/Etc. Uniforms.  EDIT: One's heavy and the other is light.   You realize Gi's for Grappling Arts and Gi's for Striking Arts are different right?   DUDE.  It costs **a dollar** and it can save your **life.**   Where can I read this at?   Honestly, this.  What the fuck.   The Chest Gear is how they score points.  It's electronic.    I meant why are they wearing Gi's when it's not a grappling sport?   Why do Karate guys wear Gi's when it's not a grappling sport?   As of 2015:  Kicks/Punches to the Body = 1 Point  Spinning Kicks to the Body = 3 Points  Kicks to the Head = 3 Points  Spinning Kicks to the Head = 4 Points   It's full-contact sparring, actually.  	132
 Couldn't agree more with this. So many so-called authors out there try to use the ebook space as a quick-money scheme. Guys like JA Konrath pump out garbage left and right and take the full royalty from Amazon. I'd actually like to see now just how loyal that presumed fan base really is. It may hurt the writer, but it protects the reader as well.   Of course, Amazon could also REFUND based on how much you don't read, but I guess that won't be happening.    Is it the re-published, un-edited version, or the one the publisher put on shelves before King decided to reprint them in the spirit in which they were intended?  Coming from someone who read the unedited, 1000+ page version, it's only slow because you can just tell which parts were left on the cutting room floor. But I do agree with the overall sentiment here - stick with it. It's definitely my favorite of his.    Well it's important to note it's purple. You know, because we don't need the color blind guy at the range complimenting OP on his nice "gray" bow.    I kind of wonder a lot of the things you ask as well whenever I think of Bukowski. Was he someone that generation could relate to better than ours? What exactly about his style has cemented it in the legacy of writing? And to that point, what style does he even fall under?  I never really found him to be funny. If anything, he portrayed himself as the heroic anti-hero. And by that I mean, he knew he was a horrible person but by virtue of embracing it and pretending to not care what people thing, he believed it ultimately made him cool in the eyes of the reader.  I've never read Ham on Rye, but I've read his Tales of Ordinary Madness and Women. Both were awful. To be honest, I feel one picked up where the other left off. And it doesn't even matter which order you read them in. They're all basically about the same thing: Misogyny, alcohol, drugs, sex, horse racing, fighting, more drugs, more women, more sex, a crappy car, cigarettes, bowel movements, more alcohol, sex again, the occasional note about writing something, alcohol, sleep, a hot bath, and the list goes on.   I don't know why, but I keep trying to find something of his worth my time. I just can't seem to find THAT story yet. At this point, if the works I've read are any indication, I doubt I will.    Karim Mayfield is looking to hit the Chris Algieri lottery. Hope his acting skills are up to the task.    And therein lies the issue with magazines. Less people buy them, companies still feel the need to make em, so they jack up the price.    Hot off the grill in 8 - 10 minutes? Fast food isn't fast anymore.    No way he wants to fight GGG. No one wants to fight him, let alone a 42 YO retiree looking to make a return after seven years out of the game. Training or not, there's no way he gets back on the map soon enough, especially at a caliber high enough to face Golovkin.   Well OK then. Carry on.    Ay, go easy on him. It's not pink. Or even bright purple for that matter. I dig it, actually. Nice one, OP.    Not entirely sure if I should be insulted or not by your suggestion to take on something that is dumbed down...   To be honest, I don't think that was even an option on the Kindle I had at the time. And even if it was, my attempts at paperback proved futile as well.    OK, I know I'm taking a big risk saying this but, Game of Thrones. The very first book. I tried it on the Kindle and determined halfway through that it would be best read as a paperback since it likely required a lot of flipping back and forth to remind myself who some of the characters are.  Then I tried reading it in paperback and similarly struggled. Just wayyy too many names, places...things. I tried, I failed, and I'm sure I'll try again at some point.    I agree with Eogris's comment below - Just embrace the chaos of it. The plot line is centered on insanity. It's not supposed to make sense to anyone (which is more or less what a Catch-22 is).    I'm with ya. Tried it twice over the span of three years. Just couldn't do it.    **Pirates Latitudes, Michael Crichton**  It's been sitting on my shelf for a while, so no better time than now. This is also my personal double shot of Crichton, as I just started and finished The Great Train Robbery last week.    I guess you could say Burroughs is a little dark and depressing in his style, right? I'm basing off only two books thiugh, but he comes from a different place. Sedaris finds the humor in the awful stuff and leaves you laughing at his unfortunate circumstances. He's a satirist in its purest form.   Yeahhhhh the cold calling thing was a bit annoying. Also, what luck to have plucked them out of the group of similar names so quickly, huh? I guess it is the job of a journalist and all, but the method and execution in the novel was poor, to say the least.   David Sedaris is literally the complete opposite of Burroughs. I'd recommend "Me Talk Pretty One Day" to start it off. You may easily find yourself laughing out loud in public though, so you've been warned. :-)   Wish I could answer your question, but while on the subject of Burroughs, I enjoyed Running with Scissors but found Dry to be a bit cliche at times. I guess it didn't help too that during the time in which I'd read his stuff I was also tagging off on David Sedaris' stuff. So really, the two couldn't be more opposite and I guess I was just drawn to the things that made me laugh a little bit more.    I just finished Sarah's Key last week and I've been meaning to ask fellow readers what they thought about it (assuming they've read it, of course).  I for one really enjoyed the parallel storylines throughout the first half of the book, but found myself pretty disappointed when that stopped abruptly and focused on the journalist's side. Then, with about 60 pages or so left in the book, I knew exactly where it was going (all the way up to the big "reveal") and immediately found myself begging for the end to come. I liken it to my reading of "A Farewell to Arms," whereby I knew "it" was coming and found myself outright mixed with vindications and guilt for being right with two pages remaining (vague? Perhaps. Just trying not to be spoilery). I guess I'm totally open to being wrong with my assumptions whenever I'm reading.   OK - Sarah's Key. Thoughts?   Thanks so much. It was a lot of fun to write.   (A joint project between myself and Mr_Agucci)  Anne shut off the burner on the stove, placed the lid on top of the mashed potatoes and walked it to the dining room, oven mitts on of course. After opening the door with her back to the family, she spun around with the goods in hand, ready to finally sit down for another hearty Wilson Family Feast.  OK boys and girls, dinners served. Pray then eat. Will, its your turn to lead the prayers.  The family bowed their heads in respects around the table, as Will took center stage.  Good food, good meat, good God, lets eat.  William! Anne shouted, the insult of her sons actions lending a crack to her voice. You will say your prayers and you will say them correctly!  Sorry mom. Sometimes its hard to know what to say, but everyone knows a good prayer goes a long way.  Fed up with her sons actions, Anne turned to her husband, who mumbled a quick prayer and kicked off the evenings meal.   Mom these potatoes really hit the spot, but have you ever seen the power of the Quick Chop? Will asked.   Anne looked up from her plate. Im sorry butwhat?  Yeah, what are you going on about boy? his father asked.  Will, unresponsive to his parents comments, continued to chomp away at his dinner, unfazed by the awkwardness that began to hang over the table. Unprompted, Will dropped his fork onto the table and began to sob uncontrollably.  Son, whats the matter? Anne asked.  I must admit I havent felt like myself, more like Im living the life of someone else.  I just dont get the rhyming, Sally, Wills older sister chimed in.   Shush you, said Anne. Your brother is obviously distressed. She turned back to Will and nodded for him to continue.  I woke up this morning as the sun came in, wondering how my day would begin. It felt like any day but I cant recall, all I know is I didnt feel like myself at all.  Then whodidyou feel like? Anne asked.  Will paused and collected his thoughts, eyeing his family nervously as he continued. I know that this is going to sound silly, but I feel like my name once was Billy.  It is Billy, you idiot, his sister said. We just call you Will because Dad goes by the name of Bill.  Do NOT call your brother an idiot! their father shouted.  Whimpering in response to the scream, Auger, the familys black lab and Wills closest confidant, walked away with his head hung low, the smell of his urine stain permeating through the room. Concerned for his best friend  after all, he did name the awesome pup years ago  Will snapped into action.   Powered by the air you breathe, activated by the water you and I drink. Its Mother Nature approved!  A pin could have dropped at the dinner table as every member of the Wilson family turned to face Will.   Hey, at least it wasnt a rhyme this time, Sally said, before realizing the error of her own ways. Damn  What did you say, son? Bill said, all eyes on Will.  I love beautiful wood, dont you?  Well yeah, but  It takes the hard work out of yard work!  Oh God. No. No, please, Anne said, cupping her hand over her mouth in fear of the reality before her.  What is it honey? Bill asked.  Its  HI! Billy Mays here for Flies Away! Will erupted, filling the room with his suddenly-booming voice.   As the family cringed in response, nearing hysteria and fighting the urge to flee, Wills eyes rolled into the back of his head, as a dizzying sense of balance overwhelmed him and sent him face first into his plate of mashed potatoes.   Remember, he mumbled, face first in the mound of food. Nothing absorbs the shock quite like Impact Gels.   Funny to see the main image being Stephen King. The first book that came to mind before I even clicked the link was "Thinner," but I GUESS he gets a pass since he wrote that under his pen name.  Also, the "cameo" was just his characters suggesting a scenario was like "something out of a Stephen King novel."  	24
 1. I have problems sleeping face up and I can only sleep on my left side. Can I preform WILD on my side? Cause' in all the tutorials they are on their back.  2. What positions should I keep my jaw in?  3. What should be going through my head?  Please don't answer if you haven't successfully done WILD. I always seem to get answers from those people.

A longboard.   Omg, I fucking loved that part of that beautiful game!   that comic sans font makes it      Beg your pardon?   Wow, that's so well done.      Is this Jiminy Peak in Massachusetts? I'm there right now!   touche   YOU WALKED INTO THE WRONG NEIGHBORHOOD, MOTHERFUCKER!   *sigh* It's a reference to a video game.......      MY NIPPLES ARE AS HARD AS DIAMONDS, NOW I'M SO EXCITED!   Forget Skyrim, it's a great game and all that, but the real fun is in Oblivion and Morrowind. Skyrim's quests are all the same, "I lost my ring! Please go into the random fucking cave and get it for me. Watch out for draugrs!" While the other gameS in the series are like, "I lost my ring! Please get it for me it's in the well! ....... Haha! now you're trapped! I can use you in my demonic ritual now! WAIT NO, WHAT ARE YOU DOING! NO, STOP EXPOSING ME AS A NECROMANCER!"   A old age of empires-like game called Black and White 2 is awesome, you can be a evil god to your cities or a good god, you get to control the world with this big hand and it changes as you become evil or good, also the wars in the game are cool too because you can do things like throw rocks at the other armies.  Any fable game would also be a good choice, it's an RPG where you make choices that make yourself good or evil, your weapons, armour and spells depend on your good and evil traits too. You can do things like marry someone, have kids, THEN BRUTALLY MURDER THEM :D!  Lastly Just Cause 2, short description, fuck the storyline, go be a terrorist on the huge sandbox map you have to explore. You can do things like, steal a car, cover it in C4 drive it off a bridge, land on a speed boat, jump out of the car, grapple hook onto a chopper, throw out the pilot, shoot the C4 with a missle and watch the whole thing go up in flames. Plus being on PC you can mod the game and do things like give yourself unlimited ammo and invincibility!    Dishonored is a completely different game mechanic but it has that great sneaky-peeky feel to it, also Hitman: Absolution has a similar mechanic and it has a lot of options as far as how you can complete the mission, lots of cool kills in that game.   I'm super extrovert, but I'm not triggered by speaking just sounds.      Oh it was a apple product? Good, it got what it had coming.   No, you're just misusing the term "gay".

So when I got to middle school, most everyone put that behind them. I didn't. I was a ass to one kid for about 1.5 years then I had a teacher who kind of became my mentor. He never knew I was a bully, But he taught me human values. I stopped being mean to him and we were kind of acquaintances. The next year in high school I said I was deeply sorry and that I knew there was no way I could fully make it up to him. He did forgive me though. After that I became SUPER sensitive to any form of bully, no to me though, to other people. I stood up for people as much as possible. Not sure if this helps, or even if this will be seen, but best description I have is ALOT of self resentment and guilt that the bully doesn't know how to deal with.   Half Life 3   That's skull kid, not majora, majora is the name of the mask. Awesome drawing anyways keep it up.   No, they're even I think.

 How about depending how much shipping is I'll pay it. I live in the New England area.    Another game I have you may be interested in is Transformers: the first Cybertron one. The case is a little messed up but the game itself works perfectly.    Nothing that may interest you. Cut really short on ps3 games ever since I sold it.

I can't send the pictures through the comment but I will post them on gameswap and just go to my account to see them. Sorry for the inconvenience.     Both really really nice.

 Dude....  I get it....She said "I think I'm done now" because she was done killing o-o.  People like that fascinate me. I mean, what in the world possesses them to do something like that? What was so traumatic or heartbreaking in their lifetime that they felt the need to kill?   I've been pretty broken before, I've been downright pissed at people who'd hurt me, but I never wished them dead, nor would I ever attempt to kill them.    She never said whether it ever actually died or not.   But she did say that her mother claimed to see it several more times, standing in their yard years after it ran off,just standing there, staring into the window, only to go and get my grandmas dad and find that the dog was gone.

Maybe it's the ability to give your life in exchange for your family to be set and live comfortably. What do you care? You sell crap to strangers.   I got a box in the mail about two weeks ago. I used to love getting packages. I opened it, and found that the only thing inside was a bloody gray stump. A finger.  Then I woke up.  I wish that this was where the story ended; a bad dream. I couldn't get back to sleep after that. It had felt so real. After giving up on sleep, and getting showered and dressed, I went downstairs to find that my kitchen sink had clogged. A steak knife had fallen deep into the drain. When I reached inside to pull it out, the disposal kicked on. For a second, I saw a flash of my pale severed flesh being buffeted around by the whirling blades. I never found the finger.  I wish that was where the story ended.  But in last night's dream, I got another package. Inside was a brain.  I'm not getting out of bed today.   I was more just pointing out the hypocrisy of anyone saying "That's a trope! You suck!" when stories outside the norm don't even get read.   I like it. I know a guy who goes by the name of /u/Grindhorse.  The beginning sounds really choppy. Short sentences; this, then this, then this. Maybe there's a way to make it flow a little better.  Definitely agree about the shortened ending. I sort of read it as "I'm sorry. It's almost time. Blah. Blah. Blah."  I think the main way you could improve the story is to create more sympathy with the narrator's character. They need some humanity! A lot of the focus is on the sister, and I love her, but she died. I know how her arc ends, it was tragic. But why should I care if the narrator is dying? I don't love them (yet).   Another vote for hanged.   "I make gifs reddit just for fun."  Is that what it's supposed to say?   Here's something: God forbid you  actually write something totally original. There wouldn't be anyone there to read it! NoSleep is actually a culprit of this. It's like they came here to get more of the same thing that brought them back here in the first place!   I was debating. (*Another* bathroom story?) Now I've got to read it.   At least it didn't say something else!   I'm not the killer.

At least let me pull my pants back up before you flay me.   I don't know who originally had the tape. I got it in 2012 when I bought the camera at a yard sale. It made me sick to see so much death.   That's one way to look at it, thanks. Makes me feel a little bit better.   Thanks. I decided not to throw too many twists in there and just stick with the prompt. It's a great picture.   My Queen!

Family from faraway places that Wallace only got to see once a year, and then only *if* they could make it. The thing was an eyesore that had to go. A testament to the laziness of the person who owned in the house it sat in front of. And it wasnt even his.  On Halloween, the jack-o-lantern had just... sprung up, when everyone elses had been destroyed by kids with their bats.  Wallace couldnt put his finger on what terrified him about it. Maybe it was the eyes, the way the empty sockets would follow him, even at night. Maybe it was the way it continued to glow every night, even though hed never once lit the candle inside. Or, the reason he was afraid to stick his finger anywhere near the mouth, those sharpened orange teeth along the top row that would extend and retract whenever he was around. Perhaps it was the smell like death that sometimes wafted through the windows since it had shown up.  It was time that he threw it out.  He wore his wifes gardening gloves. *Its getting rotten and I dont want to touch it,* he told himself.   He rolled over a lidded can, and even brought a big rock to put on top. *I dont want the wind blowing it over,* he told himself.  The pumpkin skittered and rolled through a gap in the boards and disappeared under the house.  *I was right,* he told himself.   I want to apologize, but cant. The guilt of losing a piece of my towns history is burning a hole in my gut, but its not something that I can just talk about with them. Its not something that you can just bring up in casual conversation.  History can be a powerful thing in the wrong hands. A persons reputation controls them, and in a small town like mine, their history defines them. The antidote then, is to control your own history - to keep evidence, to continue remembering.  I lost a video tape, one of those little ones that fits inside a portable camcorder, and now I cant even apologize for it... but maybe I can make up for it, even a little. By sharing it with you. This piece of history, uncut, unaltered: the truth.  The tape begins in mid-November, 1993. Peter Smith, 8 years old at the time was given the camcorder by his uncle for his birthday. The first five minutes or so is mainly made up of the kind of stuff youd expect an 8-year-old to film; clipped conversations, awkward shots of family members half out of frame, people singing happy birthday where the camera cant decide where to focus because of the dim lighting of the candles.  Without warning, it changes to the inside of a cramped apartment. Childrens toys and clothes scatter the floor. Peter is doing a fake newscast in his bedroom. His sister Nicole, just five years old, does a convincing impression of the local weatherman, capped with a back to you, Pete!  Together, they belt out a breaking news theme, trumpets, drums and all.  Their father bursts into frame. Keep it down! he hisses. Your mother is trying to sleep!  Peter, frozen on camera, looks mortified. He suddenly seems very out of place wearing his fathers tie over his Power Rangers sweatshirt, blond hair cut into a 90s bowl.  Nicole speaks up. But mommy sleeps all the time! We never get to do anything anymore!  Peter leaves his seat and steps out of frame. Randall, their father, crosses in front, kneeling down to hug his daughter. Just before the tape transitions again, you can hear him say, Shes sick, baby. She-  *-clip-*  In the next shot, the family is packing boxes into the back of an orange and white moving truck. Dad, can I keep the camera out and film this? Peter asks from behind the lens.  Sure, champ! Randall is loading a box labeled clothes into the truck. Hes smiling. Its obvious that some time has passed since the last scene, and seeing him now is a huge contrast to last time he was on the camera. A blue plaid shirt stretches across his broad chest. Hes grown a beard, and the new look suits him well.  Where are we going daddy? Nicole asks.  Oh, baby. I told you, were moving to Oregon.  Ory-gun? Why?  The cute factor of this five year old is killer. Shes adorable. Long, dark hair hangs down nearly to the bottom of her puffy, dark blue winter coat. The coat forces her arms out from her sides, and a pink beanie with a frilly pom-pom tops the whole spectacle like a cherry.  Were going to start over there.  Start over? Like Noah?  Randy smiles widely. What do you know about Noah?  He put all the animals in his art and there was a biiig flood, and then the sun came out and God gave them a rainbow. Then they started over.  Thats very good, honey. And youre absolutely right, were going to put everything on our ark, he gestures to the moving truck, and were going to start over new.  Is God going to give us a rainbow when we get to... to...  Oregon?  Yeah, Ory-gun.  Maybe hon-  *-clip-*  The tape skips again, for several minutes, Peter films out the window as cars and brightly-colored signs fly past. He quickly pans, showing his sister in the carseat next to him, and his mother, Quincy, driving. The orange moving truck can just be seen ahead of them through the windshield.  *-clip-*  Did you get it? Did you get that?" Quincy asks. The camera is moving all over the place. You can hear the belt unbuckle and Peter points the camera out the back window of the car. Auto-focus struggles and then settles on the rain-covered glass.  No! I missed it, youve got to go back!  I cant go back, Pete. Its okay, though.  Nicole starts crying.  No mom, weve got to go back and film it. We have to!  Were not gonna make it to Ory-gun, now! Nicole wails hopelessly.  Nicky! Nicky! Its okay! Were *in* Oregon. We just didnt film the sign at the border, thats all. Its alright, now calm down.  Peter mumbles a Sorry, Nicky, before shutting the camera off again.  *-clip-*  You see Randall and the kids in a hotel room with two queen-sized beds. McDonalds happy meals and wrappers are on the tables. Nicole is squealing, jumping on the beds. She looks like shes never had more fun.  Dad, video tape us! Peter says, and hands the camera to his father. After a few fumbling seconds, it turns to show Peter now in place on top of one bed, his sister on the other facing him across the divide.  Ready? Peter says. Go!  The two jump. Peter easily clears the gap, doing a bellyflop on the other side, but Nicole lands on the hard edge of the bed. She starts crying and Randall immediately sets the camera on the bed, facing the wall.  The door bangs open and as Quincy comes in from outside the room. Shut up! God damn it, what the fuck are you doing, Randy?  Sorry, Quin, we-  Shut her up. Shes going to wake everyone in the fucking hotel.  Hey, cool it, Quin. Please?  Im going to go finish my smoke. Pete, its time for bed.  Mom!  Ssshut up! Just shut up! Jesus, all day long with you and... she trails off and the door slams shut.  Nicole and Peters sniffling is the only thing you can hear for a a few seconds. Randall breaks the silence. Its okay. Youre okay. Lets just get ready for bed. You know what tomorrow is?  We get to our new home? Peter asks.  Thats right, and were going to start over over there, remember? Things are going to be different. I promise. Okay guys?  Okay.  Now lets go brush our teeth.  The camera stays on, ignored on the bed next to the wall. When the kids have come back and are tucked into bed, Nicole asks, Daddy? I dont think mommy likes me. I dont want her to come back.   Heyyy, Randy says soothingly. Mommys going to be okay again. I promise. Remember how she used to play with you all the time? Remember before... before she got sick?  No.  Well *I* remember. And you know what? Shes still your mommy, and shes part of our family, so we love her no matter what. And I love *you* no matter what. And you too, mister.  Love you too, dad.  The front door opens again. Quincy sighs, Finally.  Hey... Quin, can we talk?  Randy, Im fucking tired. I really dont need to hear it right now.  Come on, Quincy. Just... You promised youd try this.  I am trying. What do you call this? Moving hours away from everything just because your friend is selling his house?  Sh! Lets go outside.  Fine, but you say one thing about your new pal Jesus, and Im gonna...  Just... Youre going to wake the kids. They dont need to hear us like this.  The door closes and though the voices start off muffled, you can hear that Quincy is shouting. Eventually, Randy comes in to go to bed and turns off the camera.  *-clip-*  In the next shot, the family has already arrived at the new house. Peter is running outside while making motor noises with his mouth. Nicole is sitting on the porch steps, organizing her pink Barbie backpack.  A white, two-story house sits in the middle of a grassy clearing surrounded by tall evergreens. A hand-made garage and a gravel driveway that leads to the main road are the only other things in the grassy clearing. Dark clouds hang low over the house.  Peter steers onto the large front porch, through the front door into a furnished living room, catching a glimpse of his parents sitting at dining room table, then barreling down the hallway and out the back door. As he runs beside the porch again, his father calls his name.  Youd better come in! It looks like its going to rain out there!  Aw!  Wheres your sister?  I dunno!  Nicky!  They continue to call and look for her, checking behind the garage and in all the rooms of the house. Quincy joins them outside, hands stuffed into her pockets, dark hair blowing wildly in the stirring wind.  Where could she be? Randall says, returning from the driveway. I mean, she couldnt have gotten far, right? I knew we should have gotten the phones hooked up sooner.  I think she left, Randy.  What? No. She probably just...  Its happening again, Randy. Shes so quiet that the turbulent wind very nearly swallows her words.  Quincy, its-  We lost her!  We didnt *lose* her. What are you talking about?  Fuck you, Randy. You know what Im talking about. Quincy goes inside, leaving Randall staring at the empty space that she just occupied. Snowflakes have started falling in force.  *-clip-*  Peter and Randall are in the car, making their way down a narrow gravel road.  Dad, where are we going?  Were going to go into town so we can get the police to help us find your sister.  Trees are blurring by on the both sides, the gravel path winding between them. Snow has fallen in the areas where the branches above are sparse and flakes are starting to pile up on the windshield.  The gravel driveway drops down a final steep incline to find a two lane highway with wide shoulders. Randy slams on the brakes, and the car skids in the soft wet gravel.  What? Randall says.  What is it dad?  I dont know...  Is that a person?  Randall opens the car door and crosses in front of the cars headlights. Peter is pointing the camera through the window onto the road, but its impossible to see anything there in the gathering darkness.  Randall jogs a short way, then suddenly stops and raises a hand to his mouth. He bends down and scoops up a shapeless black form. Zoomed in, the camera is shaking in Peters hands.  Get in the back seat, Pete, he says through the glass. Randy opens the door and lays the dark mass in the passenger seat. The camera zooms out and another mans pale face comes into focus.  *-clip-*  What the FUCK are you doing? Who the FUCK is that, Randall?  I found him on the road. Hes hurt, but I didnt see a car or anything.  And you just *brought him here?*  The roads are closed going both ways. The trees are just blowing over everywhere. Every few feet another one is down.  Jesus, is he even breathing?  Randall carries the tiny man over to the couch in the open living area, in front of the wood stove.  And what about Nicole, Randy? Did you see her?  Im going to keep looking. I dont know how long I can stay out in this weather. Ill try to get through to the neighbors houses, at least. Maybe she just got lost and went over there. Its going to be fine.  You- youre leaving me here? With *him*? And what if he wakes up? I dont believe this.  Pete follows his father out onto the porch with the camera. The snow is falling so thickly that the little shed not 100 feet from the house is completely obscured. Wind blows audibly on the microphone, creating a hiss.  Stay here! Randall shouts at Peter and points back into the house. He disappears into the flurry. Peter takes the camera back inside, and films the falling snow through the window.  Nicky.  The whisper is just barely audible.  He turns toward the living room. The black-clothed stranger is lying there on the couch, unmoved. Peter comes in close with the camera, putting it right up to the mans face. It looks contorted, like hes snarling in pain. Rigid, scraggly hair clings to the mans chin and cheeks, tapering off as it rises to the mans spotted, bleeding scalp. Black scabs the size of Snapple caps adorn his head. Purple lips and sunken eye sockets lend to the mans overall shabby, sick appearance.  Nicky.  The camera is pointed directly on the mans lips. The thin purple lines take up the whole frame. They dont move, but you can clearly hear the whisper.  Nicky.  Peter! shouts Quincy from the stairs behind him. Upstairs!  She catches him mid-step as he flies up the stairs. You dont go near that man again. Do you hear me? You stay away from him.  *-clip-*  From the top of the stairs, the camera points down on the front door and the dark living room. A few glowing coals remain in the fireplace. Randys jacket is still white with snow. In the dim light, the camera has difficulty finding something to focus on.  What are we going to do, Randy?  Its out of our hands now. He looks exhausted, bedraggled. His jacket stays stiff as he hangs it up on the hook. Shes in His arms. Im going to pray now, and you can join me if you want.  No, thanks. Thats your department, but Ill send a letter to Santa, just to cover our bases.  What?  To Santa. Its a joke.  Wh- How could you say something like that?  You know... I think its like you said, maybe everything is going to be alright now. This could be a fresh start for us, baby. Quincys blurred form is moving closer, slowly.  Quincy, if youre trying to... mock me, this is really not the time.  Im not mocking you, Randy. Im being serious. Im sorry. For everything, I mean. When Olivia died, I mean... Things were bad before, but that just broke me. It was too much.  Randy hugs his wife and gulps back a sob. It was somehow worse, though... because there was still Nicole. They looked so much alike, do you remember, Randy? Do you remember all the little twin outfits and matching bows and shoes? And after she was gone, all of it was double. Extra. It killed me that I couldnt get rid of it, or throw it out. Because I still had *her* and we werent really allowed to move on.  You can see that Randall has pushed himself free of her arms now. He holds her at arms length.  I know you didnt want to listen when I told you this before... But I know she killed Olivia.  Shut up.  I know it. And having her there all the time, it was like living with her ghost.  Stop it, Quincy.  Now shes really gone, dont you see? It wasnt *natural* for one to be here without the other. We finally cleaned the slate. We can start over, now.  Shut the fuck up! Damn it, Quincy, it was an accident! Just stop it!  You know, I never forgot what you said when you first came home that night.  Dont.  What did you do to my daughter, Quincy? What did *you* do? Wheres *my* little girl?  Youre an alcoholic, Quincy. You were depressed - you were sick. Thats... Youre sick.  I dont feel sick anymore Randall. For the first time I can even remember, I feel... fine.  A curdled scream from the old man shakes the air and startles Peter who runs back down the hall and into his parents room, locking the door behind him.  Hes awake! Randy yells from the other side of the muffled bedroom door.  *-clip-*  -ome down and meet him. Now, he hasnt said anything yet, but were going to take him into town as soon as the light comes up. You and I are going to have to cut some of the trees up, you think you can help me with that?  Okay.  Great.  Randall looks like he didnt sleep at all the night before. His hair sticks out at odd angles and his face is pale and sagging. Even his smile looks weary.  Down the stairs, the man is sitting at the table with his back to Peter as he approaches.  Um, sir? Randall ventures. This is my son, Peter. Sorry, hes into video taping everything right now.  The man turns slowly to stare through the camera at Peter. Chewing, his mouth works side to side like goats. Then he turns back, and methodically takes another spoonful of oatmeal.  Well, want some breakfast, champ?  Wheres mom?  I think shes still slee-  *-clip-*  Pete, already in the back seat of the car, watches as his father carries the skeletal form from the house. The sun is coming up, and even though a thick layer of snow covers the ground, the placid rain is beginning to thin it back down.  Slowly this time, Randy maneuvers down the gravel driveway.  Skid marks, he says as they reach the road. Look at that. Right there on the edge of the bank. I couldnt see them last night in the dark. Hold on a second, Im going to take a look.  Randy jumps out of the car and jogs across the highway. Peter zooms in. He turns around to say I can see his car! before he drops over the edge of the embankment and out of sight.  He zooms back in, and pans from side to side, scanning the road for his fathers reappearance. He stops as he notices that the old man has turned and is watching him with a vacant expression.  Do you know Nicky? Peter asks in barely more than a whisper.  The mans lips spread into a smile, revealing long, crooked teeth rotted and black at the gum line. His eyes dont leave the camera and Peter. He just stares and smiles.  The car door jerks open and Peter is pulled outside. Randall is back.  Dad! Dad, he knows something about Nicky!  I know.  Randall is clutching a pink backpack in his fist. With quick movements, he opens the trunk and exchanges the backpack for a wood saw, then moves around to the passenger door.  You son of a bitch, he says as he drags the man out by his coat collar. Unable to support his own weight, the man drops helplessly to the ground. Peter, get back in the car. Stay there. Randall drags the man by one leg over the embankment again and out of sight.  For a long time, Peter just sits in the car. You can hear him breathing.  *-clip-*  He turns the camera on, pointing down the road heading South and leaves it on for about thirty seconds before shutting it off.  *-clip-*  Theres some kind of noise outside the car like thrashing in the brush. After about a minute it goes away, and Peter turns it back off.  *-clip-*  Randall walks back across the road. There are no signs of the old man or the saw.  *-clip-*  Through the rain-streaked window of the house, Peter zooms the cameras focus on the point where the gravel driveway enters the woods. You can see his breath forming fog on the cold glass.  Dad, theres someone outside.  One broken headlight and half the silver grill of a huge truck just peek around the tree line.  What? The curtains move as Randy pulls them aside for a better look above the camera.  It looks like its crashed.  Yeah, it does. Maybe they hit one of those downed trees or something.  How come theyre not moving?  I dont know, Pete.  Seconds tick by.  Im going to go out there and see if theyre okay. Just stay here for now, alright?  Okay.  Randy opens the door.  Dad!  What?  Im scared.  Its okay, champ. I promise, okay? I love you.  Love you too.  Peter points the camera back out the window, and Randy pulls the door quietly shut. Soon, he steps off the porch and into the frame, walking toward the truck.  He freezes, squinting ahead.  He turns to run back to the porch. A sound like a cannon fires from the truck, rattling the windows, and Peter drops down beneath the window. His breath is ragged with panic.  The camera creeps back up to the window. Randall is there, lying face down in the mud. A red spot is growing on his lower back. His arms are still moving, groping, but he isnt able to drag himself. Hes reaching for the window - for Peter.  The auto-focus is shifting from the window to the curtains to Randall.  From the truck, a bear-sized man in a black fur coat takes a few limping steps into the clearing toward Randall. Hes carrying something like a 4x4 in one hand, propping it up over his shoulder.  The bear man whips the wood down through the air like an axe onto Randys skull. Peter drops down behind the window again, struggling to contain his crying.  You can hear the thumps from the club in a steady cadence, and then everything falls quiet. Even the rain pauses.  Irregular footsteps sound on the porch, then a knock at the front door, but Peter doesnt move. The doorbell sounds, pressed but not released, *ding*...  The knob slowly turns and the weather stripping creaks as the door cracks open.  *dong*  Peter sprints up the stairs. The sound of the doors glass panes shattering is drowned out by a roaring scream that isnt human. Peter bolts straight ahead, opening his parents bedroom door, and shutting it behind him, placing his back up against it.  MAMA! He screams and drops the camera.  Bare feet hang next to the bed, a few feet off the floor, a chair kicked onto its side underneath them.  The door frame splinters, and the camera is knocked under the bed, plunged into blackness.  Peter goes silent in an instant.  The sound of the killer beating him and his mother goes on and on.  The rest of the tape is of the dark, which eventually goes to blank. The whole thing is about 45 minutes long.  *Was* about 45 minutes long.  The Smiths were discovered by Ronald Preisler, still technically the owner of the house, the following day. Hed met Randy through a church conference that theyd attended together.  The car found in the woods near the base of the Smiths driveway could not be traced back to a registered owner. It was assumed to be owned by Benjamin Burns, a career truck driver whose body was found nearby, hacked to pieces with Randall Smiths wood saw, and bearing signs of blunt force trauma not consistent with a motor vehicle accident. Burnss truck was reported stolen after the fact, but was never recovered.  The body of Nicole Smith was discovered to be washed nearly a mile down a nearby stream. Hair and blood samples place her in the abandoned car near the time of the crash. The handles on the insides of both rear doors appeared to have been torn off. They were not found inside the car. However, when it was recovered, it was found that the latch was damaged in such a way that the door could not stay shut or locked.  Quincy Smith was found in the upstairs bedroom of the house. The time of death estimated to be several hours before her son Peters, whose body was found in the same room. While his cause of death was determined to be blunt force trauma, hers was shown to have occurred prior to the trauma her body underwent.  Randall Smiths death was the only one thought to be a mystery, since he was charged with the murders of his other family members and Benjamin Burns. The cause of death was said to be the gunshot wound. The subsequent marks of trauma were said to be post-mortem, rendered by some unknown passerby who came across the scene.  The video tape was never entered into the police file or as evidence in the investigation. I got it almost two years ago, now. I nearly destroyed it the first time I watched it.  Instead, I hid it away in a box of video game cartridges. A box that was recently donated to a Goodwill in the next town. It wasnt there when I went to look for it. Ive gone every day and asked, but they keep telling me that they dont have it, and if they did, that someones bought it by now.  Im unbelievably sorry. But I cant tell them now.

[By Jazon Kang](http://www.artofjasonkang.com/)  **[Giants](http://payload266.cargocollective.com/1/10/327310/7628284/undead-giant4.jpg)**   I've noticed a couple of themes in your stories. First, they have sort of non-characters. They seem to be there solely to react to whatever's happening like crash test dummies. From the stories I've read, I couldn't even describe them, much less explain what makes them tick.  And what makes them tick is really critical. The main character should want something - that drives nearly every story ever told. Even if they want something small, there's tension being built there.  *Inception: A Love Story* was pretty lopsided this way. The tension and suspense was all in these lines at the beginning:  I jerked my hand back and looked beside my nightstand. Kneeling there, smelling of week old bologna and malt liquor, was a man.  There's the shock - the wtf moment - and then the rest of the story is downhill from there. Why? Because I don't care about the character. The newspaper headline, "Man murdered in bed," isn't the same to you as a text from your mom saying that your father was killed by a vagrant while she was asleep beside him.  *Rats* was much better at this. The character had flaws and intricacies that humanized them. While it seemed odd that he'd go relax in a supermarket after being scared out of his own home, seeing the labrador/human/eye-bulging rat there worked well.  So as for middles... If there are interesting elements and pieces in a story, then the middle should happen on its own. Don't be afraid to let things get complicated, but once they do, just untangle that web in a straightforward, compelling way and the tension will happen, and you don't need to worry about the middle, because it's not forced.   Oops, sorry! I saw it there for a while but it had 0 points so I put it off. (Who downvotes a legitimate request for feedback,  btw?)  Then I noticed your username, and realized that I'd just been talking about you for your fresh prince of nosleep theme song. Which was amazing and actually made me laugh out loud.  If I run across something to help with "middles," as you call them, I'll let you know.   Awesome questions, all! I hope the suspense is killing you.   There's an "*irrational*" fear of the dark, then there's a fear of what's *in* the dark.  Right now, I'm not sure how story-like this is. It's more of a mood for the story. Especially that beginning paragraph; it's too obvious. Especially as a leading paragraph, I'd worry that readers would think "We know, we know," and scroll down past that. In a novel, it might work because you've got the room, and readers are willing to invest time, but here in short storyland... I might not include it at all, but especially not at the beginning.  So what's left?  Here, the story's switched to second-person, present tense. It's an odd, uncomfortable tense to use and it's almost impossible to make it work within the constraints of nosleep. I'd recommend not doing it in that tense if you're going to turn this into a story.  The thought of being kept up at night in bed for a fear of noises in the dark is both very classic and relatable... and also very overdone. The part about the tiny sliver of doubt creates some tension because it seems like the narrator is about to reveal something that only they know. Being able to turn on the lights kills all that tension.  As for the ending: Who would say "You may want to reach out into the dark..."? Would it be the narrator? The person who was hiding in their bed? If so, what happened to them to make them change their mind?  Sorry, but for me, this is a long way from being a story. It's more of an angle to write a story with, but fear of the dark itself is not a story. If it is, then you're holding out on us with the details!  Hope this helps. Keep writing and good luck!   This was nice, and I still feel like I missed some other pop references.   You *murderer!*   Unfortunately you had to vs. unfortunately you did. I'm just saying I think you may have put it in the wrong spot.   Just a thought: it isn't unfortunate that you leech tagged the post. Those are the rules. It's unfortunate that they haven't given anything back to the community yet - but there's still hope!   This made me cringe. It wasn't about the "twist" or "figuring it out." You know. You can see it from the beginning.  It's about watching OP who can't tell. It's about their willful ignorance of reality and the tension lies in how far they're going to take it - what are they going to do next?  Totally creepy. You're fucked up, OP. You need some help.   [I took some notes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RN6x1Cmf1RxVPZgSRn-MlVro5FdpRQMesWkEu4f9Nwk/edit?usp=sharing)  It's a really good story! I can't wait to see it on nosleep.   First impression is that it's actually too long. It's more than bite sized. I like the twist, and the students' abuse is creepy.  I just feel like there's either a longer story here or a shorter, more powerful one. There's just too much explanation to not enough scare.     That's exactly what I'd say if I were omniscient.   Oops. Don't post your story here, go to /r/nosleep for that.  Also, put two line breaks between paragraphs to break up your paragraphs.   I guess this tags along with what /u/EtTuTortilla was saying about writing for yourself.  A few months ago, I did Camp NaNoWriMo, which is basically a miniature version of the one in November. I started my novel, disregarded everything I shouldn't do while writing, consequently wrote myself straight into a corner. The whole thing was unusable. I was going to have to start from scratch if I wanted to pull anything out. But what was wprse was that I didn't even want to write it any more. I just wanted to hit mt word count and finish.  So I did the hard thing: swallowed my pride, manned up, and quit. Not only did I quit, I went to another sub and wrote another mess of a story about how I was quitting.  I was a mod of /r/writingprompts at the time, and another (better) mod, /u/DanKolar62, posted this in the comments:   Being goal-oriented instead of self-oriented is crucial. I know so many people who want to be writers. But let me tell you, they really don't want to be writers. They want to have been writers. They wish they had a book in print. They don't want to go through the work of getting the damn book out. There is a huge difference.  James A. Michener  He didn't put it in quotes or anything, so I thought it was just him straight up calling me out until I got to the end.  It was one of those moments where that was exactly what I felt like I needed to hear at that moment. I hope that I don't forget that and sometimes I wish someone would come read over my shoulder and say "Quit your bullshit."  But then I remember that if someone had been sitting behind me this whole time, I'd be more than a little freaked out if they suddenly spoke.  The point is, I can deal with all kinds of stories written at any level, but it gets me - it offends me - when someone tries to gouge their readers with the stuff that even they don't care about. The people who make it obvious that they're churning out a product to get you to click and vote, instead of actually trying to write.  I'll forgive them for writing it, but I can't read that stuff.   *I* see exactly what *you're* trying to do. "Good" is a four letter word, sir.  I assume that the plant story was "right now" as in, "it's imperative that it be written this moment." Because otherwise you've got time. At least a little bit of time.   What? You're stopping there? You just got warmed up.  Also, you forgot to say "most violent scene **so far**."  Come on. What are you *really* going to do instead? Wouldn't it be better to get a little bit ahead for once?   I'll say that the last time I did this, I really wished that there was some way to keep the second post from hurting the first. I thought that the first was fine, but I also thought that I could write a sequel.  It went... okay.   Hey, write fucker.   I'm really excited to see someone like /u/Grindhorse break every single guideline and still manage to pull off a great story.   I did this! I did this a whole bunch actually.  Bad Atom.   Aaand read part 2. Awesome, awesome story. You can't beat that frame and setting for anything.   Try to do some research on drug use. Watch movies, read books, etc. The more you know about your content, the more naturally you'll be able to write about it.   I made some [edits here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vVNJu3GlCkorm4n2N8Jors07VlbxKmiLK_5_z3QeAdA/edit?usp=sharing).  There's a kernel of creepy, story-worthy tension here, but it's so buried under "blue" writing.  There's got to be some balance of investment on the part of the reader (time and trying to understand what's going on) and payoff from the story. Everything above really only covered the house (so much description of the house), introducing the characters (though only the sister, mother and main character are even in it) and stating that they saw green eyes in the forest after moving in.  I think it's just going to lose the reader with this little story progression over this amount of writing. I know in school, they tell us to be descriptive as possible, but the *real* challenge that they don't tell you about is knowing when to use it. There are very few authors who I could actively read as they described a house.  Outlining might help you out with this one. If you've got goals for each section, or even setting them for what each paragraph is supposed to accomplish in terms of moving things toward some eventual climax, I think the story might move along a little better.  Keep writing! Don't quit!  I really want to know about the green eyes!   Creepy story. This is one of those with a classic vibe.    The Artist is so damn good.   Holy shit.   Surprisingly, Coulson had the best line.   Right, and she would know that she wasn't trapped by a pimp, but would she really know about "most girls" in the area?   Child werewolf? [You inspired me.]( http://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/2l5i3c/sewer_friends/)  Great story.   We went down into the sewers hoping to find all the toys they'd claimed over the years. There weren't any piles of slightly-used baseballs or brave, flood-riding plastic ships. All there was was stink and rot and mold. Our parents were right.  So far.  Further along the tunnel, we heard skittering ahead; claws on wet cement. From the inky, humming blackness and into the beams of our flashlights bounded a beautiful silver-haired puppy. We were rescuers; heroes. And we loved him.  Thomas and I fought over who would get to keep the dog. We couldn't tell our parents of course. Tom was bigger than me, and he won the first night. Shep went with him.  He wasn't at church the next morning. His parents were upset with mine. He'd told them that he was staying the night at my house.  When I got home, I changed out of my clean clothes and dashed into the woods. He'd be at our fort, a tarp-made-tent under the low boughs of a big pine.  Tom's blood was everywhere, but he was nowhere to be found. Drag marks through the sandy soil led toward the road and I followed them. Fresh footprints lined the way. The grown-ups were probably already looking for him.  The trail ended at the mouth of the sewer. I found Tom's body lying inside the open grate. Something had eaten him. Bones and clothes.  "I had fun with you," said a child's lisping voice behind me. "We all liked your friend. Momma says when the moon's big I can be your Shep again."   Hey what an... interesting story.  The first line was a little jarring. "At that age" isn't explained, or obvious because there isn't any context yet.  There's just *so. much. detail.* that doesn't really **need** to be there. You could probably cut 25% of the sentences in this and tell the exact same story. I'll be up front and say that I didn't love it, but that's how most of your readers are going to feel about it. I came in cold, and going through the kids organizing the wedding, performing the wedding, a description of how to play Red Rover, them playing it...  It's a slow build. I appreciate that, but these things don't serve to build the tension, they're really just filler.  The narrator was possibly the best part. It stayed consistent and really revealed the thought process of the kids really well. The only line that didn't work for me was the one about Humpty Dumpty, which felt cliched and less profound or interesting than it could have been.  The twist at the end was definitely strange. It leaves so many questions. I almost think that the story could have been better without it. It's almost like the story goes from ABC and the ending was point H.  Overall I think it has potential, but these things made me lose my interest and my overall impression was that a lot of it was words-for-words-sake. With a good edit, I'd like to see it again, on nosleep or somewhere else.   I'll throw in some thoughts just to be contrary to what the others have said.  In something this short that's truly flash fiction, you've got to take shortcuts. There isn't time or space to really develop anything, so you've got to use loaded language.   In "Lick," the story is scary because the reader puts themselves in the place of the narrator. Nothing is developed about that character, but the reader substitutes something they already know to fill in that massive blank. Buddy is the dog that everyone's had or met at one point. It doesn't require any explanation. That's effective, but delicate.  The obvious problem with this piece is that it's unoriginal. Aside from the spelling (lower case "i") and grammatical errors (the first sentence is a run-on, the last sentence is in a different tense than the others), I might have thought that this *was* the original.   The story starts with "Once upon a time..." and keeps that tone throughout. I'm not sure that it's believable enough for nosleep the way it is right now, but it's got some strong points that make it so that it might work somewhere else.  One good thing is that it doesn't shy away from the subject matter, which is just about as dark as it gets. I almost didn't want to read it, it was so dark.  Everything is stated so matter-of-factly, actually, that it runs into that territory of being hard to understand who the narrator is supposed to be. Things are extremely black and white, like bullet-point facts (look at how many sentences are basically X did Y. X did Z.), and some of them don't make sense for any one person to know. Especially since the ending reveals that the narrator is one of the johns. How would he know that "she was one of the few girls on the street who didn't get trapped by a pimp," for example?   Reality is rarely so cut and dry, but it almost works in this fairy tale setting. The only thing is that there should maybe be less of it, with more substantiation, and more left up to the reader's imagination.  The main character's development arc is a little crooked. She seems invincible, and smart and perfect in every way. It breaks the tension. She has to be vulnerable and human sometimes or it's not exciting. Along the same lines, so much of the story revolves around the need for money and what people will do for even $1000, but when she becomes an "Avenger" (not fond of the title) and is able to track down men and kill them around the world. Sometime in the middle of that, she decides to be a plumber.  Then we get to the end, and find out that the narrator is actually an old man. I liked the twist, actually, but I can't really feel bad for the character, and I also didn't feel scared of the fate he had coming his way. Maybe he shouldn't have been a perv in the first place. He's *so* unlikeable that he's hardly human. He's flat, in terms of character development, a cookie-cutter villain like the others.  Don't stop writing! Good luck.

Above the 29th floor, they give you a discount on your rent each month to offset the inconvenience of the elevator occasionally going out.  As such, I found myself hauling at least 40 pounds of groceries up 33 flights of stairs on a Saturday. Ever notice how the stair wells in buildings always look unfinished? Like, the builders spent all their time and energy on the rest of the interior of the building and then got to the stairway and just said Fuck it.  My footsteps echoed all around the unfinished cement-and-metal chamber. I wasnt alone. Others passed me every few flights, heading in the other direction. I was worried that theyd see me sweating. The groceries pulled my arms and the insides of my shoulders were beginning to feel like Silly Putty.  I was at the 33rd, and a couple of young 20-somethings that lived down the hall from me were passing on my left. I was forced next to the railing so that they could pass. I looked down the center of the stairwell, and the drop was dizzying. Something fist-sized and black smacked against the back of my head from above and continued down the drop. I recoiled in pain and surprise and dropped the groceries so that I could rub the painful goose-egg forming on the crest of my skull.  What was that? Krista asked, trying to stop some of my groceries from rolling all the way down the steps. Are you okay?  Her boyfriend Mark was charging up the stairs shouting loudly. Someone upstairs was shouting Morty! Im sorry!  Oh man. That fucking hurt. It felt like the area that had been struck was bleeding pretty badly, but when I pulled my hand away it was covered in stringy red-tinted clear slime. What the-?  The man from upstairs had pushed his way past Mark and ran past us. Morty! Im coming! Are you okay?  What the fuck! I yelled as he stomped on my eggs and bread strewn about the landing.  Mark asked Are you okay? and he and Krista helped me pick up my groceries and carry them into my apartment.  Thanks guys. Im okay, I think, I said. I was feeling especially tired, but my scalp had mostly stopped hurting.  What was that guys doing? What an asshole. You think he dropped his phone or something?  Yeah, I think Ive seen that guy before. Hes totally weird and reclusive. He lives next to Beth on the 42nd.  Mark put out his arms theatrically like he was trying to catch a football. Moorty!  Yeah yeah. Thanks again guys. We gotta get together sometime soon. I owe you.  Okay, yeah. No problem. Hope youre okay.   My legs gave out as the door closed, and I sat on my couch. I was so tired I could hardly keep my eyes open. In seconds, I was asleep. My last thought before drifting off was that Id left the milk on the counter with the rest of the groceries.  I woke up feeling hotter than the sun, pouring sweat from every part of my body. My jeans felt painfully tight and restrictive. I raised my hand and tried to stand up and witnessed that my fingers had become large, pink sausages. My entire body looked as if it had been inflated.  I stumbled with dumb, unbending legs to the bathroom. My swollen body could barely fit through the door. I caught a glimpse of something in the mirror. It could not have been *me*. Surely it was some kind of monster. I reached up to touch my hair - recently dyed with red highlights. The power went out and I was plunged into blackness. The hair stayed in my hand, coming away from my head in a mess of slime that wouldnt come off.  My phone was trapped in my tiny jeans. The belt had sunken into the mass of flesh around my waist and I wasnt able to get to it.  I stumbled out into the lightless hall, and knocked on Krista and Marks door before feeling my way to the stairwell. Red emergency lights revealed a large black snail the size of a softball slowly working its way along the railing.  The stairs were incredibly hard to maneuver. With each step I actually worried that my tensioned skin would tear and burst. The heat was overwhelming and it was hard to breathe through my swollen throat. My eyes had become puffy and cut my vision to slits. Someone fell from above me and screamed as they fell down the middle of the stairwell, hitting railings and bouncing back and forth all the way down.  I made it to the 42nd and pushed in the door. Beths door was the second from the stairs on the left side of the hall. My foot came down on dozens of snails, each step causing a sickly, thunderous crunch. They were coming from the apartment next to Beth's. I pounded on the door with my fists, but they were so soft it hardly made a sound. I kicked it with my shoe and felt my ankle burst, hot fluid pouring out onto my foot. I fell and felt the snails pointed, jagged shells moving under my hands.  The door opened, and sunlight streamed in through the windows behind a swollen figure. They got out! Oh god, I let them out! I went after Morty when he fell down the stairs and left the cage open!  He was screaming. I could see the shells sticking out of his skin, the entire heads of the snails having burrowed inside down to the bone.  We screamed as they ate us. Slowly - at a snails pace. It was all we could do.  Then I woke up on my couch. The power outage had caused the thermostat to reset and the inside of my apartment was roasting. I turned it down to 71 degrees and put the rest of the groceries away.   Stop it, you guys are making me hungry.   *Piggybacon*. Butler's got jokes.   Great work, Butler!   Maybe it's just because the subject was in the Navy, and the story was told from the point of view of the psychiatrist, but this reminded me of [The USS Eldridge](http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1e923u/uss_eldridge/)   Oh yeah reddit won't let you paste italics from somewhere else.   Overall, I thought it was a decent story. It doesn't wander too far, and stays mostly focused on the action which is good. There are a lot of little mechanical errors and faux pas which are distracting. It just really needs a good edit, where at least 30% of the lines could be cut out.  The cut scenes/flashbacks are so distracting. I tried to put in line breaks where I found them.  The biggest thing that I saw was trying to keep the immersion. Allow your characters to act like people and to react to what's around them. The narrator was inconsistent - sometimes it was the girl, sometimes it was omniscient. Some of the dialogue was clunky and action-movie-esque.  There's a good story here, but some work needs to be done to really get it out.   The banging stops.  A low growl comes through.  But you cant stop me from taking her.  I bury my face in moms jacket.    What are you? I shriek out.  It hammers on the door again.  Answer me.  Why won't you leave us alone?  Hard to shriek out with a face buried in someone's clothes.  Molly get downstairs now, this is your final warning.    Moms finger hits the trigger.  The gunshot is a cannonade that ruptures my eardrums.  I scream with it.  The banging stops.  "Cannonade" is an awesome word to use here. Ruptured ear drums are an actual thing that can happen. If they "erupted in pain" or something, then that's one thing, but the main character doesn't appear to actually go deaf after this point.  I didn't get her mom whispers.  I didn't get her, I didn't get her.  The door visibly caves in on its hinges.  OHMYGOD! I duck back into cover.  Please tell me theres another way out of here.  What kind of pistol was this that caved in a door?  No.  Mom shakes me a little.  Hey little one, whatever comes through that door we're going to have to face it, okay?  She plants a warm kiss on my forehead.  Stay strong.  I cant.  This is your final warning Molly.  The window above us shatters.  Something long and black comes through and grabs mom, ripping her out of my arms.  She screams and flails, I lung[e] and grab at her.     There was a window? Why weren't they trying to escape through it?  Mommy, no!  Then shes gone, and I'm sobbing alone.    The doors lock finally gives way.  I crawl into the corner and cower around my little knife.  It swings open unevenly, the damage to its hinges prevents smooth movement.  A tall figure steps inside.  Hey Molly a familiar voice says.  I look up slowly.  No way.    Door frames are usually made of wood and tend to give much sooner than locks and hinges. What caused the damage to the door?  Dad?  He steps around the bed and stands over me, smiling like he used to before the fights started.    Hey little one.  You okay there?  He offers a hand.    Wheres mom? I demand.    Lets not worry about that, we'll get her back.  He strokes my hair.  A warm tingling runs down my back.    Will we?    We will, promise.  I take his hand and he pulls me to my feet.  I'm so weak and frail compared to his massive muscled bulk.  He hugs me with more gentleness than Id expect from someone of his size, but I dont feel comforted.    ---  Im in the shower, when theres a click of the lock turning.  Hey!  ---  Were getting you out of here kiddo.  He takes my hand and leads me downstairs.  Im his princess again.  We head out into the hall and downstairs, where the lights are now on.  My living room looks so safe and friendly.    Screw this, Im calling the cops.  Wheres my phone? I ask.  Weird transition from "It all looked safe and friendly," to "Screw it, I'm calling the cops."  Ive got it.  He grins at me.    ---  Dads immense figure steps into the bathroom, masked by steam.  Uhh dad, you know Im in the shower, right?  Oh I know.  ---  I grab at my head.  Where was that memory from?  Dads hand feels like its burning against mine, I want it gone.  So what happens now? I ask.  He grins at me.  Im taking you away.  You'll be safe.  He leads me to the front door.  Theres another person dressed in black and red out there.  Is he dressed in black and red too?   ---  Dad sweeps aside the curtain.  I let out a shriek and cower away.  Dad what are you doing?  He grabs me and pulls me towards him[.]  Just relax princess, everythings going to be okay.["]  ---  I drop to my knees in shock, his hand leaves mine.  Why couldn't I remember that before?  Oh my god, I feel so disgusting, he  I begin to shiver and try to block out the ensuing image, but it just overflows the dam and races through my mind.  How could I let him do [that] to me and forget it?  I cant go with him, hes giving me that same grin.    You okay there? he asks, smiling like hes my actual father.    I need to get out of here.  I can't get out the front door and whoevers outside will just run me down if I go for the back.  That leaves me with going back upstairs.  I remember my computer in my room, with a lock on the door.  I feel around below his gaze.  Moms knife is tucked in my waistband.  It easily comes free.  Why do you want me?  I ask.  Because youre my daughter and I love you.  You shouldn't[.] I'm a real bitch once you get to know me.  I leap up and stab him.  The blade sinks into his soft knee knee and lodges deep in the muscle and bone.  He lets out a yell like a wounded lion and collapses.  I take off running back through our house.  His friend chases after me, feet thundering faster than mine.  I hit the stairs and leap up them three at a time, then swing right and slam my door.  The deadbolt snaps into place.    "...his soft knee knee" tee hee.  "I leap up and stab him." But you stab him in the knee, where you didn't even need to leap up. Also, you repeat "leap up" when you get to the stairs.  Open the door! Mom yells.    No!  I grab my computer and open it.  My hands are shaking so hard it takes three tries to bring up Skype.  It dials Kelseys number.  Please answer please answer please answer.  The screen flashes to show her, half asleep.  Kelsey, call the police right now! I scream.  The door begins to buckle.  Whats going on Molly? she mumbles.  Two guys broke into my house, they have my phone and mom.  Please hurry!    Her eyes go wide.  Okay!  She yanks out her phone and dials.  Hello, police?  My friend needs you.  Shes at Four Willow Drive.  She says someone broke into her house, Im looking at her on my Skype someones trying to break down her door.  Hurry!  Her eyes go to the door slowly giving way.  Hang on Molly!    Fuck this I'm killing this bitch! a low voice snarls.    Leave me alone dad! I cry.  He doesnt reply.  You're my father, you're supposed to take care of me and protect me.  Why don't you understand?" I hear a gunshot.  Something brushes against my leg.  I look down, Im bleeding from a gash across my calf.    The last time you heard a gunshot it was a "cannonade," this time you just heard it.  Molly, are you okay? Kelsey begs me.  No.  One of the door hinges comes flying off.  They're breaking through, I have to go.  I run to the window and yank it open while she screams behind me.  Cold November air rushes through, shocking my lungs and driving frozen talons into my body.  I clamber out onto the window sill and turn around.  The door splinters apart and dad comes through.  A feral snarl is on his face and his fingers are grasping for my throat.  I let myself fall backwards.  The window rushes away, air blowing through hair.  Theres a pop and my leg explodes with pain.  I scream for the umpteenth time that night, and my vision goes white.  Reality returns after a few seconds.  I'm flat on my back, can't move my right leg for the agony coursing through it.  Its twisted unevenly under my body.  I have to get out of here, the cops aren't going to make it.    *Crawl.  Your leg will heal if you live, fucking crawl.*   Hand over hand I drag myself across my front lawn.  A blue SUV that I've never seen before is sitting outside our front yard.  Ill hide beneath it until the police get here.  I'm almost there, I'll be safe.  Wouldn't the SUV belong to them in that case? I'm not even sure that hiding under a car in this case would work.  Someone kicks me over onto my back, sending waves of pain running down my leg.  Dads face appears inches from mine, eyes bulging and sweat running down his brow.  Dad, why won't you just leave me alone.  I loved you and this is all you did to me.    His fingers tighten around my throat until I can't breathe.  I kick beneath him and smack at his face but hes immovable, smiling in satisfaction even.  My arms grow weak, my lungs feel like they are going to burst.  I spasm uncontrollably beneath his vice, anything to get him off me before he kills me.  Theres a tunnel forming in my vision, just his terrifying face is left.    *Too late, I'm sorry Kelsey.*  A gunshot echoes in the distance and suddenly his hands are gone and I'm gasping for air.  Dad stands up, blood leaking from a hole in his chest.  A fusillade of shots rings out, and he folds up on himself.  His body lands [on top of] me, and my vision finally goes black.  ---  I'm lying in a hospital bed, my leg in a brace and a line hooked up to my wrist.  Its so cold and dark in here, I might as well be back outside.  Im curled beneath the blankets in my fluffy pink pajamas and some warm stockings, but Im still shivering.  Moms dead, the police found her lying beneath her window with her throat slit.  They wanted me to identify the body until a nurse yelled at them, a syringe in one hand.  I dont want to get up, ever.   A voice murmurs in the distance.  Then more voices, getting closer.  I instinctively tense and curl up the best I can to avoid them.  Let me see her! Kelsey[s] scream cuts through them.  Get out of the way, let me see my girl!  I open my eyes and roll over.  Kelsey leaps onto my bed and throws her arms around me.  Hey! a doctor yells and runs into the room.  I hug her back as tight as I can.  This time no ones pulling her away from me.  Kelsey stares at me with wide eyes.    Poor Molly.  Its going to be okay.  She kisses me on either cheek and presses her smooth forehead against mine.  We form a nice little pocket of warmth together.  Howre you doing? she asks.  My heart accelerates.  They cant hurt me anymore, I am unbreakable.  Molly nods.    No they cant.  They cant break us.  We curl up together, safe against the monsters.     I curl up in my bed, my head pounding and body shaking.  My sheets are soaked in my sweat.  I can only hope that he doesnt find me.  Im only eleven, little girls dont get murdered, do they?  It struck me as being unlikely that an eleven-year-old would consider themself to be a "little girl."  ---  Molly, whatever happens youll always have me.  Promise.  My best friend Kelsey smiles at me through my computer screen.  Shes so sincere I try to grab her and accidentally slap the screen.  I laugh sheepishly and the effort hurts my chest.  Kelsey rolls her eyes and giggles.  [Were pretty similar people, physically at least.  Im about five seven with brown eyes, smooth auburn hair that I like to wear a bow in, and a lot of freckles that seem to make everyone think Im adorable despite my closing in on sixteen years old. Kelseys two inches shorter and mousey, with similar straight hair and freckles.]  The appearances are a bit of an information dump. They don't have any bearing on the story yet so they don't feel natural here. It's jarring to read and breaks immersion.    Thanks Kelsey.  I dont know what to do, Livy says that shes going to kick me off the cheerleading squad if I tell anyone she was shooting up.  I cant just let her destroy herself like that though.  I curl up on my bed.  [Its around ten oclock but Im still dressed in my blue skirt, pink sweater, and black tights that I wore to school today.  Kelseys in her ratty old sweatshirt and ready for bed.  Shes usually out by eleven while I linger on past three.]  More info dump related to appearance.   ---  I cant deal with this anymore Mom sobs.  Dad is still screaming away upstairs, the house shakes as he punches a wall wall.  I climb up from the table Id been hiding under and throw my arms around her waist.  Thanks baby.  She doubles over and buries her face in my shoulder.  In the first paragraph you mentioned being curled up in bed, now you're under a table. Would the house actually shake if he punched a wall?  Why cant we be a normal family? I ask.  I dont understand, why cant mom and dad just get along?  Why does dad scream at me for every little thing I do wrong?  Rhetorical questions don't translate as well to this kind of storytelling. Every time the narrator directly tells something to the audience, it takes the reader out of the scene. Basically, it's distracting.  I dont know baby.  ---  Look.  Its clearly hurting Livy, she used to be the nicest girl on the squad and now shes a bitch.  But you can't help everyone.  Just leave her alone and see what happens, we can't help everyone.  Are you sure?  Kelsey sighs and frowns; saying this hurts her as much as it hurts me to hear it.  Yes, I know it sucks but I don't think trying to help her is going to end well.  Her decision, her problem.  ---  Dad comes down stairs.  He sees his suitcase sitting flap limply open atop his tangled clothes.  I smile at him hopefully.  His eyes widen, skin goes bright red.  MOLLY!  ---  Okay.  I press my face against my laptops keyboard.  Its nice and warm against the cold November air that get in because mom doesn't have the money to raise the thermostat above [sixty] and re-caulk the windows.  Once again Im saying goodbye to someone I love.  Panic rushes through me as I recall my list of people Ive left.  Livy used to be our friend, everyone I know is leaving!  Sixty degrees is really low. The main character goes from "Okay" to panic in a split second without much explanation as to why.  Kelsey sees where this is going and cuts me off [n]o theyre not, we love you.  Just remember me, and all the other girls on the squad, we love you.  Okay?    I'm hanging onto her like Ill fall off a cliff if I let go.  Okay.    ---  I love you, but I have to go dad said.  He couldnt even look me in the eyes as he zipped his bag back up.  I stepped between him and the door.    Wasn't he red-faced and screaming? What happened to calm him down?  Im not letting you leave dad, were a family I cried.  He shook his head and shoved me.  Actually shoved me, I hadnt expected it and I went down ha[r]d, smacking my head on the floorboards.  Mom screamed and ran over.  Despite the pain racing through my skull, my eyes were still on dad, as he slid out the door and slammed it behind him.  ---  Moms hoarse voice wafts through my door.  Molly, come downstairs.    Thats mom, gotta go I say.  See you in the morning, love you.  Kelsey smiles and waves, exposing dimples.  I grin at her until she closes her computer.  Then I do the same and with a sigh clamber out of my comfy bed.  I head out the single hallway that makes up the second floor of my house.  The walls are plastered with cracked white linoleum and the blue carpet is flat from use.  Molly!  Shes downstairs, probably staring at something I left where I shouldn't have.  Coming mom! I jog to the stairs.  Someone grabs me from behind before I can leap down them.  Theres no one else in the house.  Hey! I shriek and whirl around-to see mom standing over me, tall and worn from life and still in her business suit.  Mom, whats going on?    "There's no one else in the house" tells the audience something that only an omniscient narrator would know, but the narrator is supposed to be the main character. Would the main character know for certain that no one else was home? Would they doubt themselves if they heard someone else?  "still in her business suit" is not something that I would have thought to mention in a fearful situation like having someone else inside the house. As the reader, I just don't care about this, I care about what's going on, and I feel like the main characters should too.  Shhh.  She puts a hand over my mouth.    Her voice calls from below.  Molly, come downstairs right now.  I leap, my heart freezes in my chest.  I turn back around and stare into the pitch darkness of our downstairs.    Im going to call the police, stay with me Mom whispers into my ear.  I nod frantically.    Something moves at the foot of the stairs.  Molly! I leap back, slamming into her.    This is a really nice play on the impersonator story.  Into my room! mom says.  She grabs my shoulders and we run down the corridor to her room at the end.  Mom shoves me through and slams the door after us, locking it.  We're trapped[,] in her small bedroom with no protection beyond that flimsy door.  Comma not required.  Molly!    My hair stands on end.  You want to separate these two things to show that they're coming from separate characters.  Oh my god, what is that?  We need to call [nine one one], my phones downstairs[,] wheres yours?  I search through my pockets.    9-1-1 is the typical way of writing this.  No I whisper.  "Where is...?" isn't answered by "No."  Oh no.  I hear a steady thumping running up the stairs.  Mom[,] its coming!  The footsteps race down the hallway towards us.  It feels like a lot of time has passed since the narrator has focused on a lot of small details. If it's "racing," shouldn't it have been there already?  I know.  She runs over to the [k]night table and  opens the drawer.  I follow her, because it feels safer to be by her side than anywhere else.  A small black pistol that I'd never seen before appears in her hand.  A small knife appears in her other.  I got these in case  Is "appears" the best verb for this situation? It's repeated twice, but it's not even actually what's happening.  In case dad? I ask.  I never stopped hoping he'd come back, I guess mom did.  I can't blame her.    Yes.  She shoves the knife into my hands.  Were going to have to stay here until morning.  Do you think you can use that?  She winks at me, trying to be confident.  I hold it awkwardly in my hands.  Rule number one, stick them with the pointy end?  She grins and nods.    This seems unrealistic that they'd be joking with each other while they're in a potentially life-or-death situation.  BAM the door rattles on its hinges.  A scream shoots through my lips before I can stop it and mom jumps.  "Racing" and yet several lines of dialogue go past before it arrives at the end of the hall.  Molly, I wanted you in the kitchen ten minutes ago, get down there right this instant!    You should probably explicitly make mention that this is your mother's voice.  Mom grabs me and cradles me to the floor.  She aims the gun at the door with an arm thats shaking like a leaf in the breeze.    You cant have her! mom yells shrilly.  I snuggle up under the crook of her elbow and wrap my arms around her.  It cant take me if I dont let go.      Dude, you're not burying it for long enough to get a nice patina. Really bury it and water it every day, then dig it up.   I was a big fan of the older games, which introduced me as a kid to the whole post-apocalyptic genre in such a cool way. I'd thought that the series had died out, and then they made F3. Such awesome games that hold a lot of sentimental value for me.   I know. That's why I wrote it for you.   I don't think that I was - or am - anything special. As you said, I didn't do anything. I just had a bigger monster than Alan in my corner.   Ssso good.   #[Thailand](http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/2kduka/it_found_me_in_thailand/) #[Home](http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/2khdne/it_found_me_in_thailand_2/) # Calling  The next afternoon I called Ben and asked him to meet me for lunch. He showed up twenty minutes late and double parked his car. In the daylight I could see the scratches left over from his late-night drunken joyrides. I was glad he'd made it home in one piece last night.  When he walked in, I tried my best to act like I was excited to see him. It was very important that he like me. He was visibly confused. I told him that I'd had fun catching up with him last night. He didn't apologize for trying to kiss me so I did for not letting him. He seemed interested again after that.  I told him I wanted to hang out more today, and tried to work in a joke about how we're both unemployed now. He even laughed, despite clearly not getting that he was the butt of the joke. He was content to live off his father's money doing whatever he wanted every day. How could that ever be a bad thing?  "Oh! I almost forgot. Could you go with me to this one place downtown? There's this creepy guy who works there, and I'd really like to have a guy there with me. Just in case." Ben agreed.  I had to work desperately not to run out of things to talk about as we walked. We got to the shop and he let out a groan of frustration. "Antiquing is fucking lame."  "Oh, it won't take long. I just want to see if I can make a trade. Then maybe we can go somewhere... *private.*" From the sleazy smile on his face I saw that I had him again.  The For Sale sign was gone from the front of the shop now. The windows were full of trinkets and dusty items - a bicycle, a throwing star, a silverware set... Nothing about the place looked new, in fact it looked like a store that had always been there. If I hadn't seen it empty just last night, I wouldn't have believed it.  I didn't see Alan inside, though the podium was in the same place it had been at the store in Pattaya. I made Ben go inside first, following closely behind.  I still loved the store, as wrong as that sounds. Each item might actually be akin to a little imprisoned person sitting on a psychopath's shelf... but God damn it if they're not interesting.  Alan came around the corner from the back room. His customary smile was noticeably absent. His eyes, heterochromial green and blues, glared into me.   "What's this? New guests? Please, come in. I'm sure you'll find what you need..."  Ben looked at me to carry on with what I needed to do, but something on the shelves caught his eye on one of the back shelves. Alan took his place behind the podium, and I went to speak with him.  "You can't have the watch," out of Ben's earshot.  "I thought that you might say something like that..."  "It's mine. I've had it since I was a child and it's not for sale."  "Miss, you've already agreed to the terms. The deal has been made, and I'm afraid that there's nothing that I can do."  "Yes. There is... Take him." I tilted my head toward Ben. He hadn't moved from the spot, apparently entranced by something that I couldn't quite see.  At this, Alan's wicked smile came back. "An interesting wager. I'm afraid that it's not something that's yours to give, however."  "Why not? He came willingly. Take him instead, and leave me alone. Forever."  Alan hissed through his crooked lower teeth and studied the former jock. "I'm sorry to disappoint you. In order for the transformation to occur... well, suffice to say that it's very difficult, and requires quite a bit of investment on my behalf. A lump of coal does not have the same value as a diamond,  you understand."  "What if I could brought you another diamond?"  The man's eyes narrowed to slits. Thousands of little wrinkles ran together to darken the skin around his eyes. He looked angry, but there was something else in his reaction too. Curiosity.  "You've got no way to deliver such a promise. It's taken me hundreds of years to perfect the art."  I had him on his heels. He wanted it. "I've done it before."  He broke eye contact with me for the first time, and held his jaw in one bony hand in consideration of my offer. After a tense moment, he put both hands on the podium. "A *most* unusual offer. I must say that I am very intrigued. Our deadline still stands, but I will accept another object suitable for my collection in place of the watch. *If* you are able to procure one."  "Deal."  "Not so fast. If you're not here by dawn, I'll have to perform a repossession. You understand. The watch will be mine of course, but I'll also have you." He was visibly excited as he said this. "A most interesting customer."  "Fine."  I could feel Alan's grin on my back as I made my way over to Ben. He still hadn't moved even an inch since I'd started talking with Alan. Not even breathing.  "Ben? Ready to go?"  He started as if I'd just found him daydreaming on the job. Then he was back to his normal, abnoxious self.   ---  It was late afternoon when we got to the Boy Scout camp. Dark clouds hung heavy in the sky, blocking out the sun. A chain and padlock held the gates shut tight, so Ben parked his car on the gravel road and we walked in.  The camp looked the same as it had when I'd been there as a kid, except it all felt smaller, the trees,, lower. It felt like a place that I'd outgrown. When we came into view of the dock, I remembered my fantasy as a kid where the kids would throw me out into the lake. I suppose I *was* trespassing but for some reason the fear felt childlike and silly.  "Where the hell are we going?" Ben finally asked.  "Just ahead. I want to see something." We were passing the central mess hall, the hub in the center of the tiny cabins.  I'd turned around to talk to Ben, and as I faced forward again, I saw it.   The tree was gone. In its place was a small, round gazebo-style building with a cloth roof and wood sides. On every side of the building was nothing but bare sand in a wide circle. Even a hundred feet away from the dead spot I heard the silence. It was like dunking your head in cool, still water and letting it fill your ears.   I hopped down the last of the dirt trail. This was it. I could still feel it.  It was calling.  The door was unlocked and swung open easily. "Uh, I'm not going in there," said Ben.  "Not going in? Why not? Don't make me go alone," I pouted. "Come on. It'll be fun."  Inside, I could still see the tree. It was there, holding up the center of the canvas ceiling. The limbs had been trimmed and the structure had been built around it, but there was no mistaking the stark white trunk. I was so close.  "I don't know what you're into, but you've been acting like a crazy bitch all day. First you call me up like you want to hook up, then you take me to that weird shop, and now you take me out into the fucking woods."  "So? I thought you were having fun."  "Well, I mean... not really. This place is weird. It gives me the creeps."  "Sorry, I thought you'd be into this. You're right. I've been acting totally weird and this was a crazy idea. I just wanted to impress you, that's all. Forget itl. Let's go back."  He shrugged his arms like a petulant child and turned around in front of me. Beside the path, I spotted a branch that had dropped from a nearby tree. Ben was hiking back up the trail, his soft disposition was taking its toll. He couldn't even pay attention to me as I picked up the branch. It was thick and heavy and not so old as to have bugs living inside or its rigidness eroded.  A quick crack across the back of his head sent him rolling to the ground.  ---  I sat on the front steps of the gazebo. Inside, I could hear the sounds of Ben just beginning to come to. In another moment he would realize that I'd used the scouts' spare rope to tie him to the base of the tree. I imagine that he'd start yelling, but as I looked out across the lake at the unoccupied summer homes, I felt confident that the noise would die out long before it reached the ears of another person.  I had no idea how long this would take. For the first time today, with nothing to do, doubt began to creep into my mind. I absently watched the wispy fog blowing along the surface of the lake and turned the silver pocket watch over in my fingers. Feeling its familiar smooth surface was relaxing.  I flipped it open and saw the young girl bobbing in the intricate mechanical waves. 7:30. I still had time... but what would happen if I stayed all night and nothing came? What if nothing happened? What if I was wrong about this whole thing?  The watch slipped through my fingers and landed in the dead sand below. Seeing it there reminded me of when I'd vomited the watch onto the floor of the 7-Eleven along with the pistachio shells. I had to chuckle at the thought. Somehow I'd outsmarted the owner of All In Good Time by smuggling it out in my stomach. It was like something from a video game or a movie. The whole world felt as if it had gone crazy.  I just wished that I could remember the deal that I made, or anything else about that time. Why would I ever agree to something like that? And poor Mark; held to his deal which led to his death. One night of fun in exchange for a life.  Alan wouldn't be getting the watch.  Not tonight.  Not from me.  The watch was warm to the touch when I picked it up, almost hot. Heat felt like it was emanating from the sand below.  "Hey! Is someone out there? Help! Help me! In here!" Ben was yelling. He could probably feel it too. It was getting hotter.  Light shone out through the woods. The hum of an engine and car tires, shocks squealing, and pine needles, dirt clods and gravel were being kicked up onto the bottom of the car. I was anything but surprised when I saw the shape of the white convertible Mustang come into the clearing. It was the only sound, intruding through the deep silence.  Alan stepped out, his suit now blacker than the dark woods behind him, somehow appearing to suck the light out of the air around him. His eyes matched, giving the impression of the man wearing a mask with empty sockets where the eyes should be.  As he walked forward and his wide predator's smile came into my view, the wood of the gazebo groaned beside me. Ben was screaming now.  "The deal's off, Alan!" I shouted. He hadn't entered the circle, but was pacing carefully around the dead perimeter.  "No, Allie... I disssagree." The smile was still on his face, but it wasn't human, the same as the way that he held on to the 's.'  "You can't have it, Alan. It's mine." My voice cracked nervousness.  "You've got no idea what you're toying with, girl." His leather shoe stepped on the line. The little building around the tree's foundation sank. It seemed to be falling apart. Wind swirled my hair in all directions.  "You can't control thisss. You should have jussst given me what I came for."  "You mean this?" I held out the watch, letting it dangle from its chain.  "No. You."  Alan lunged forward and made an animal growl. A huge tearing sound came from inside the gazebo and Ben finally fell silent. Another step and the boards and tarp over the tree were spinning as if they'd been caught in a tornado. The collector was ten feet away. Before he got to five, the earth around us was pitching and shaking, the sand floating through the air. Just as he was upon me, I felt myself lifted upwards.  Around and around we went, the whole area appearing to have been stuffed into a blender. The white Mustang soared up past me, just narrowly avoiding colliding with me. The gazebo had been reduced to scraps of wood. In the darkness I couldn't find Alan.  Far below, in the center of it all stood the white tree, raising out of a circular hole in the ground. The barren tree was growing, its branches spreading and multiplying like a network of bleached veins reaching into the air.  I reached out for the slended branches, and caught hold of one. The next moment, everything was still. All the debris in the air began tumbling straight back toward the earth. The Mustang, from hundreds of feet up, bellyflopped into the lake with a huge splash.  Climbing down from the now massive tree took a full quarter of an hour. More than once I felt like I nearly lost my grip on the slick, white, barkless wood. Near the base I found Ben, still tied to the tree and unconscious. It was for the best that he hadn't seen everything that had happened.  I finally let myself feel the backed up, putrid feelings about myself for getting him involved. He hadn't deserved it, and I knew that I'd never be able to explain any of it. I'd used him, plain and simple, as bait. I knew that Alan's greed would lead him out here - that he couldn't stand having competition. It had ultimately been his undoing. But I'd needed a simple person to manipulate and Ben had stumbled into the role perfectly last night at the bar.  I untied Ben and dragged him out of the sandy, now sunken hole which was slowly filling with lake water. He'd live. He'd wake up confused and wander out of here on his own. Hopefully he'd just forget about the whole thing.  I hopped back down into the pit and searched around. It didn't take long to find, lying half-buried in the sand. A name tag: ALAN.  Tomorrow, I'll go back to the store. It's all mine, now.  I feel like I finally found my calling, like I've found what I'm supposed to do. I never thought that it would come from a trip to Thailand.  But then again, I didn't really find it after all. It found me.    How?  I understand the story, and the people and how the plot perfectly falls together like the cogs in the old paddleboats lazing through the water in Old Town like dried, puckered gals doing the backstroke. That part makes sense. It might actually be that simple, which is why, in a sub like this one, sometime after the midnight moonlighters are gone, when you finally come across the kind of post that sucks you in with toy plastic red lipstick and might as well have "one too many" written across her *tit*le, that you don't see it coming. The twist of a single word leading you astray at the first nibble when it's already too late because you got the barb through your mouth. The whole time you've been thinking that you're the big fish, only to find that you're really the hook who didn't catch. You've been along for the ride, watching the bait and the prey doing their mating killing dance when really it's the bit of rusted steel that, with a twist, is about to be jerked out of the whole situation only to have to admit that "I was too close to see it," before being tossed back into the mausoleum-cum-tacklebox with a thousand others just like you.  So how'd you do it, Tortilla? How'd you write this story so damn well given that godawful title?  	114

 I wonder if the FBI wallets and badges will be updated with up to date photos or will Mulder and Scully use the ones they did on the original intro, I would love a copy or two   So we getting CSI meets paranormal then   Yeah but comics go where no episodes can but I wonder how this will be filmed, probably in HD so will look great but hope it's still on film and does not look too stale, the great thing about the series is it had a certain look to it, light and dark, funny and sombre, it had it all   Yeah and it's not just Wikileaks but films like Loose Change, Zeitgeist and everything in between, but 6 episodes is limiting and it would only scratch the surface depending how the writers have done it  I wonder if the new comic book series will influence the episodes?   I get a cold war feel when viewing some older episodes especially the one with the submarine  When Mulder ran around outside it was so dark and foggy and very unnerving  The tension of the set pieces and the music really added depth to average scenes  Really hope the new mini series adds very post 9/11 and interconnected paranoia to the series as I know it's only six episodes but they all need to have a powerful message of current states of affairs   Would be great to have a section dedicated to vintage DJ sets that were spun on vinyl  Here's a stunning set from Paul van Dyk at Mayday in 2000  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcokiSnd5vs   Yeah his mix from Smack My Bitch Up into Adagio For Strings is very creative, the album was great yeah but it was more a laid back album instead of the driving euphoric stuff   Yeah they were all commercial but not always the way that MOS went with Trance Nation and the like even though original Trance Nation by Ferry Corsten was sublime   I wonder if this does happen, where else is there left to go, I think since her introduction in season 2, the show has gone to another level   Wasn't The Freak put in jail in the original Cell Block H, I know she had lots of fights with Queen Bee   I have scoured Discogs and am certain my list is correct, I have looked at all the vinyl and cassettes listed on there and only find his name on the ones listed above so chose various for the others but I may be wrong   Well, my first introduction was in the early 2000s and went to Blessed at The Republic around 2002 then Gatecrasher Resident Transmission event around 2003 so have been clubbing ever since  These albums are the best they ever made, forget the cross commercial nonsense they did after the numerous classics fodder...

 I think Leibniz solved the problem of evil pretty well. At least better than many of the competing theories that come from your average modern Christian. Basically God in his infinite knowledge created our universe. Our universe was the best possible option, which includes not mKing the universe at all. The current reality that we live in has the least amount of evil possible, and it is still better than the option of not existing. Keep in mind this is a very basic outline of the Leibniz's argument.    Why don't they just invest that money into hiring people to pick up the dog poop?    No, roommates are the worst. Nothing good will ever come from having a roommate.  	3

I've followed many tutorials to increase my FPS in multiplayer but I'm still getting around 24fps.    I've had to turn the graphics down extremely low which makes the game very ugly! It's a beautiful game! I want to experience is in its glory.    Anyhow, I've come to the conclusion that it's my GPU (Radeon 6870) and I'm looking to purchase a new one (can be a refurbished or used one). One that can handle Arma 3 at (hopefully) max settings. I also don't want to spend a fortune. I'd like to spend at max $240.    What types of GPUs do you all use to run it at high settings? Any ideas or paths would be greatly appreciated.

 The UK was at war, at most, two years longer than the US. And regardless, the UK's infrastructure in regards to factories was A) bombed to shit, and B) not as large as the US's in the first place. It had nothing to do with who was where longer. It had to do with the fact that the US had the highest manufacturing ability in the world.   Everyone needs to see this.   Thanks.

She overheard some parents while she was there complaining about waiting 5 hours in line for their spawn to see Elsa   I'm not confused, I just presented a counterpoint for your reasons    I can see the benefit of the one time use card but that doesn't make the app more sleek. I don't see the pin as a bad part because I'm fine with not having some weird physical button that also acts as a fingerprint scanner on my phone. As far as tapping the phone, that's the point, and the nfc chip is rather small so you need to know where the chip is in your phone. I've never tapped more than one for any nfc transaction I've made with my current or last phone which was the first phone to implement nfc and Google wallet    Yeah, fuck CVS, and Walmart    What's not as slick about Google Wallet?    Any nfc based payment system will work as it is a universal standard. Applepay,  Google wallet, and even ISIS (or whatever Verizon is gonna change it to)    It has worked for me   Rosauers has NFC terminals. You're out of luck though at Walmart or CVS, as they've disabled NFC in favor of CurrentC which is anticompetitive and has shit for security    /r/technology has been on its way downhill when it became /r/piracy   Time to sort comments by controversial    I do it when I'm by myself    What do you mean by cheating?    I believe CurrentC acts as a debit.  Or more accurately, an electronic funds transfer    What's up with the washing machine in the kitchen?    I wouldn't say that's prohibitive. It is a bit expensive but I think bands spend enough money on themselves that could be worth it with the tax writeoffs   Color me impressed. I may have to get one for my son when he's old enough to play. I played trumpet and I wasn't very good at keeping mine nice when I was a kid. This seems like a nice compromise    They are, just custom made   Staggering Ox, Billings Montana. OP: I love that place, any of my Billings redditors wanna do a meet up there?    Somewhere on reddit I saw a link to their simple no frills router that costs like $20 and plenty of people saying they use that as the router and then have an external wireless access point. My modem/router is already in a central location so that's not necessarily an option I need but I did notice they have wireless routers too. I'm just wondering how they compare to ASUS given any model you look at is half the cost of its Asus counterpart. Should I get tp-link or just go with ASUS?   I get the feeling she supports him but also had to be in control. In one I watched someone is on the elevator and she keeps repeating herself that he likes to film the elevators because he's "like an engineer student". She's not letting him talk for himself (is he capable of talking to other people?) and does a piss poor job of explaining what exactly he's doing. In another video he is very vocal (but there were no other people in contact with him) and described a lot of things so maybe he doesn't actually feel comfortable doing this with his mother around despite her facade of supporting his hobby? The tone of the videos with his mother versus without are very different    Most definitely a he. The female voice you hear is his mother    Watch some of his recent videos.    Daniel Radcliffe. You're fucking hilarious and great on panel shows, why haven't you done any standup (that we know of)  yet?    Sounds like a salad I can actually get behind    I was more referencing along the lines of the trilogy of Windows xp,  Vista, and 7   And then Microsoft will release Minecraft 3 which will be a hit success    Whitefish, Montana  Well that explains everything    Yeah this game just made me rage.    I'm not sure, I thought 4 did. I'm on Aeon Nox 5      I've tried searching Google for this but the only thing I found if a certain setting was enabled with lastpass and it would cause the camera to crash. However that setting on lastpass is not enabled (basically the problem would he that lastpass would look for a place to enter login credentials in the app). This is really frustrating because I can't use my camera at all now. I've tried everything short of factory reset which I'm not really wanting to do   Using Windows 7 here. I can just be browsing the web or watching a show and windows pops up with "nzbget.exe has stopped working" dialog box. I then restart the program and it can go anywhere from 30 minutes to several hours before it crashes again   Are these decent horns? I have a Xeno from when I used to play more. I'm hoping my son will take to liking the trumpet and I'd like to have one on hand that isn't as expensive but will also produce decent sound with practice. I'd let him use my old Jupiter but I've gotten that thing deep cleaned countless times and the valves are just awful and continue to stick.   I saw the Cleveland at a pawn shop for    $200. No damage except for scratches and scuffs, and the valves and slides are smooth as butter.            http://billings.craigslist.org/tls/4655066704.html  I don't know much about tools. I'm only getting started on trying to find tools now that I have space to do some woodworking      I recently saw either here or on /r/diy someone made a desk or table by gluing 2x6s together to create a flat surface top. I'd like to make a desk like that for myself and I'm wondering what tools I'd need to do the job and how to do the legs for the desk in a manner that I have a completely flat top surface, but still be able to take the legs off whenever I move      I've had this problem to varying degrees and I don't know what exactly is causing it or how to deal with it.   In my car I have a pioneer head unit with an auxiliary jack. He cable I've had in it for years has worked great for all my devices.   In my truck I used to have a different cable that would produce noise with any device. Eventually the cable broke so I used one of my shortest ones temporarily. The short one produced no buzzing noise but it was too short. I got some long ones from monoprice and the plugs are too big for my case and even without my case they don't fit snug and the slightest movement makes them pop out a tiny bit and then audio stops.   I moved the short cable that produced no noise to my work Truck that has an auxiliary jack. In my work Truck, I have to have the volume pretty loud to hear the audio from my phone. There is a buzzing but it's not too annoying. When I plug my phone into a charger, it gets louder but the buzzing gets worse and is constantly changing instead of just being a steady tone.   Would a mobile headphone amp help this issue? Or would it only make the sound louder without cleaning it up?      I mean that's a really cool feature that I don't have to pick up a remote to change an input or turn anything on. I used to cast to my PS3 but this is easier. Now here's my dilemma, can I get it to change back when the devices disconnect? I have the chromecast on my TV since it has CEC/Bravia Sync, but my receiver doesn't have it. The only remote I use is my receiver remote, so having to get my TV remote isn't preferable.   It wouldn't be so bad if every single video didn't open as some sort of playlist. When I go to a user's page and open a specific video, I'm not wanting to open a playlist of their entire history of uploads and I am CERTAINLY am not wanting to have the next video play automatically. This is driving me insane and is forcing me to use my PS3 or Chromecast for youtube because at least I don't have to worry about this problem with that platform, but the problem there is having the list of videos start back up at the top after I scrolled down for a specific video. Also, I have almost all my subscriptions sorted into categories so I can find specific users easier, which is not supported on android.   Does anyone know a way to stop this nonsense?      How can I deal with this for post processing where I won't have to do anything manual to combine them together so they can be renamed and moved appropriately?  I'm running nzbget and nzbdrone on windows      And then in passing I heard that it is a bad idea to can with a glass-top stove? Is this true? The only problem I can see is if the pot I use is bigger than the heat rings. I've never had a proper canning pot, just my regular big pot which I think fits in the big ring.   If I get a bigger pot should I also invest in an electric burner to use instead of the stove?      [you can already see the ones weighted down bowing] (http://www.imgur.com/J4qvoXO.jpeg)   What would be best to replace these with? Ideally cheap too         I have a 2012 Ram 1500 and when I got the truck years ago I stupidly didn't think that normal toppers wouldn't work with the Ram Boxes, I was too busy being impressed by the novelty of the ram boxes. Don't get me wrong, I like them, I keep my fishing stuff in one permanently, and roadside tools in the other. But I'm a little upset with myself over not having a topper. I want one because I'd like to go tent camping but I live in bear country so all my supplies and food need to be left in the truck. Bear-proof containers and coolers are expensive and don't offer much space since the walls need to be so thick, and a flat cover will just not do in this situation.   I recently bought some new cables to use in my cars for auxiliary audio. I have a really short one I've never had problems with except that it's too short. These are just simple cables from monoprice.com and I thought stuff there was decent quality but I really don't know if it's the cables or my phone because my wife's nexus 5 works perfectly fine with them. But with my phone it never stays in all the way. If you bump the phone ever so slightly, the cable comes out just enough to stop the audio   Anyone else have headphone jack problems?   Can be something big or something small but it has to irritate you to no end where you still might be irked by it hours down the road   Just moved into a duplex and the shower water pressure is just awful. I might as well stand out in a rain shower. How would I go about finding out if this is an internal issue or if it's low water pressure being supplied to the house? We have our own water heater in the unit, thought that should be noted.   What would I do in either situation to remedy this? I'm going to be living here for the foreseeable future and not having water pressure in my hot shower after doing dirty work is unacceptable. I already feel as if I can never really get clean and a shitty shower will only amplify this.  *edit* water pressure for cold and hot water is the same   I recently moved and my HTC wall adapter must have gotten packed away and the only wall adapters I have are my older ones which charge my phone too slow. I'd like to get some with similar output so I can have a few to put around the house.         I wear a hat for work, which happens to be pretty physical. I get dirty and touch the hat and I sweat while wearing it. I don't like not wearing a hat for work but my hat is really dirty and actually starting to smell awful. How do I clean one of these things without ruining it?   Our newborn hates his cradle, but most of all he hates sleeping on his back. Since he was born we have not been able to get him to sleep more than an hour or two at once on his back unless he's extremely exhausted. This is leading him to be overly tired, preventing him from getting restful sleep when he does sleep.   We found that he zonks right out when he is put on his tummy when he's tired though. He's sleeping right now and has been for 2.5 hours. I'm concerned though because up to this point everyone and everything has been saying to not lay a newborn on their tummy when they aren't being watched because sleeping face down can increase the risk of SIDS. I want him to be able to sleep but he doesn't sleep well on his back.  It should also be noted that he is 100% capable of lifting his head and turning it while he's laying face down and he can also scoot in circles when he's frustrated/hungry enough    I'm a beverage delivery driver and my hands get so fucking dirty every day and I can never really get them clean. I even got some Gojo industrial handsoap with the pumice in it but I still can't get a good portion of the crap off my hands.   [this is what my hands look like right now] ( http://www.imgur.com/Q3adbKi.jpeg)   what are other good hygiene tips for working a manual labor job?   On July 3rd our first son was born and we've been having some trouble splitting the responsibility, primarily because I work a minimum of 12 hours per day and drive a truck, which is only compounded by the fact that I get sleepy while driving no matter how rested I am. I have terrible difficulty waking up at night when he needs a diaper change or to be fed and my poor wife isn't getting any sleep and is falling asleep in the middle of the day breastfeeding him.   He seems to hate his cradle. After you've changed his diaper, fed him, and lulled him to sleep, as soon as he hits the cradle the fussing cycle starts all over. He could be dead asleep in your arms for 2 minutes or 2 hours but once the cradle gets involved all bets are off.   When I get home from work I basically take care of the baby for the rest of the evening so she can go take a long deserved nap but it isn't enough sleep for her. Luckily, we've been living with my parents because of various life events and they're helping us get on our feet again so grandma and grandpa have been really helpful as far as holding him so the wife doesn't have to be along for more than half the day while I'm gone.   I'm just at a loss at what more I can do :/      I'm looking for some new shoes but I don't know what kind will be best for delivering to stores/merchandising. What are good shoes that are good for all weather outdoor conditions as well as indoors?   He's only 5 days old right now, we've had to file his nails and we pretty much need to have little mittens on him at all times because every time he pees, poops, gets hungry, mad, or frustrated, he fails his arms like crazy and then proceed to scratch the crap out of himself. He's already gotten his face near his eye a couple of times.   My wife and I are currently staying with my parents until we get back up on our feet which could be a bit given my current job. We just had a newborn but I still end up with enough free time that I go crazy with boredom. My parents watch a lot of TV that I don't care much for so basically I'd like something that doesn't require a lot of tools, something I can do in front of the TV      I don't use auto brightness because I like to just have one consistent brightness, but every once in a while when I'm using the phone, only while it's plugged in, the brightness seems to flicker. It seems like it only happens when I'm adjusting my position or the phones position.   Months ago I posted in here asking for advice because my wife was experiencing extreme pains during the second trimester and was repeatedly dismissed by her OBGYN. It all came at am awkward time because we had already scheduled a new appointment for a different OBGYN because we were moving and the pains started right after cancelling an appointment with the old one.   We finally got into the new OBGYN and they found she had some sort of infection and got her on antibiotics and fixed her right up. Leading up to the pregnancy she had a LOT of pre-labor type contractions and also retained a lot of water and he was growing at a faster rate than what was normal I suppose.   Anyway the labor pains got real regular and intense last night and she thought her water broke so we came into the hospital. She was still only 2cm but after 6 hours of checking every 2 hours, sitting in the jacuzzi tub, walking around they finally felt a difference and decided the baby was going to come.   Long story short, she got a spinal numb (I forget the actual term but it wasn't an epidural, the doctor couldn't get a spot for that one), they let her sleep for a half hour and then the doctor came back and it was crunch time. Literally 3 contractions and he was out and breathing fresh air and crying. Everything went well.  [Say hello to Finn Orion!] ( http://i.imgur.com/MuTt9xO.jpg)      It's 4 in the afternoon, it's sunny out, I'm wearing a baseball cap, I have facial hair, and I'm driving down the interstate blasting AC/DC Shoot to Thrill. Everything is as it should be.   I work for a beverage vendor so I don't drive as much as you guys do here but I do the out of town route so I drive more than anyone else in the sales center but it's still only about 2 hours total per day. But when I do get to be on the road, I love it.   I keep getting the same thing from my parents that going to college is the best solution and I'll be guaranteed money. Even after telling them of people I knew who had pretty difficult degrees still working only a few dollars more than minimum wage after years, they think they're isolated incidents. Reddit has a pretty big user base with varying degrees of success in their lives so I'd like to try to make a chart of the data to present to them.   Working for a beverage vendor. Pay is kinda decent. I'm just wondering what other kind of jobs are out there for A CDL driver other than long haul. As much as I'd like to do long haul, I have a bad problem with driving drowsiness. I don't want to put others at risk because I can't drive more than 2-3 hours without getting tired no matter how much sleep I get.         .   When I first got the phone I could regularly get 6 hours of screen time, now after 2 months I can't even get over two hours.   [here's yesterday's battery]( http://www.imgur.com/aE149Be.png)   [here's today's]( http://www.imgur.com/FD92ZCr.png)    I can't find any recent information about the sick beard anime branch and it just looks abandoned to me. I also found there is a plugin for XDM but I can't even figure out how to get XDM to work on Windows.   I'm not really sure what good brands are to look for. The fans are about 1.5" x1.5" in dimension and have 2-pin connectors.         I think that the problem is that the software raid isn't initializing fast enough so sab resets the folder to the default which is extremely annoying because I don't have enough space on that drive to even download an HD movie. How can I resolve this?   http://i.imgur.com/wvfIuWU.png  http://i.imgur.com/r99eAQK.png  Since there's the possibility of wires changing, I decided to use decora style wall plates with keystone/quickport inserts in addition to a decora style hidden cable insert that will put wires through PVC pipe to where a cable box/dvd player/etc will go. I'd use the much cheaper keystone Cat5/6 jacks from monoprice but lots of reviews are saying they are too wide to sit side by side on the decora inserts so I'm stuck with the more expensive Leviton brand ones   I'm going to be helping my dad network his house while we have some walls torn up for a room remodel. The coaxial will run into the modem in the basement and then we'll connect that to a Wireless AC router mounted to the rafters of the basement in the centralmost spot of the house. After that I'd like to run to a large switch to send cables to each room of the house.  Wires to the top floor will need to be put through a wall into the attic.  There are three regular bedrooms on the top floor and I'd like to put two Cat5/6 to each of those rooms. The Master bedroom will have two coaxial, one on each end of the room, so in addition to that, I want two to each of those spots. I'd like 4-6 in the living room as well as 4-6 in two separate spots in another room which could become a home theater someday. [Here is a basic layout of the house](http://i.imgur.com/KpMlDXz.jpg)   There are plenty of apps that tell you the forecast and have widgets and all that and that's nice but all I care about is getting a notification for severe and then being able to look at a detailed radar of what's about to hit   I think that HTC is acknowledging the issue. I called support and they are sending me an overnight shipping label and when they repair it they are overnighting it back to me. They didn't say anything about what I'd need to pay but I'll post again if they do want to charge me for the repair.   Has anyone had this issue? I have the Verizon model and the phone is probably a month and a half old. Never dropped the phone so I don't know how this could have happened :/   I posted that I got the scooter here before but for a couple reasons I never got around to doing anything, not having the title, the money, or the time meant it took a backseat. I'm not sure where to begin with this. What are good resources to learn how to do maintenance myself?  Here's the condition of the scooter: http://imgur.com/a/fBhj4  The only thing that looks to be in good condition under the hood is the battery   I've never brewed anything before and I don't actually very much like beer but I was wondering what the process is to do root beer      I have 9.5 since unplugging the phone and it's still sitting at 100%. It spent most of that time in my pocket and about 30 min of listening to music in the car      I haven't dove into the world of NAS yet as it seems cumbersome to rebuild a RAID every time you add a hard drive and plug and play solutions like sinology are way out of my price range.   I have a HTPC case about the size of an AV receiver so it looks nice sitting on the opposite end of the TV stand. I recently got some new hard drives for it to replace a 1tb and 500gb one so now I have three 3tb drives.   basically I'm looking for advice on software raid and if it is reliable, like if one drive goes down, is my whole collection screwed? I'm getting real fed up with having to basically play Tetris with hard drive space with TV shows that are completed and shows that are continuing. I'd like to just have all 9tb as one volume so I can have one directory and stop worrying about running out of space on a single drive and having to keep transferring things.   Anyone experience this? I got the wife a Nexus 5 and while she can hear other people fine when on a call, nobody can seem to hear her on the phone. When I talk to her the audio seems glitchy and frequently cuts out. It almost sounds like she's in an area with poor service at all times even though she has adequate service.   Anyone have any decent experiences. Recently got the wife a new phone on straight talk and people have a hard time hearing her. I want to determine if it's just ATT giving straight talk lines low priority or if I need to replace the phone.   Something that you didn't like or was annoying that you didn't have any idea about and nobody even covered it in reviews.      I need to get it into my truck tomorrow before 11am and apparently none of my local friends give enough shits to help me out as my post on Facebook went ignored.   Reply here if you think you can help me out or send me a PM, thanks   If I were in Billings I'd go to Montana Jack's but alas we don't have one here. What's a good place to go to?   At first last week we thought that she was going into labor and miscarriage so we went to the hospital right away and they examined her and there was still a good amount of fluid and she wasn't dilated and they ran some tests and everything came up fine.  Fast forward a bit and her pains have been getting worse. She has had quite a bit of back pain as well as cramping pain and it's to the point where it's nearly crippling for her. She says it feels like her stomach is tightening and won't loosen up. We've tried calling the doctors and her OBGYN and it feels like nobody is taking us seriously. These guys are always like "call us if you have any questions or concerns" and yet we called yesterday and nobody answered so she left a message...no response. She called again today because it's worse and was finally able to get ahold of someone. The doctor apparently wasn't concerned at all and "too busy" to fit her in even though the place was empty when we stopped by the hospital today. All they had her do was a urine analysis to see if it was a urinary tract infection and then they would get back to her tomorrow (and we've already had a lot of experience with doctors at this hospital not calling us about test results). She doesn't feel that it's an infection though because she's had one and it didn't feel like how it does.  I'm at a loss at what to do because it feels like the people who are supposed to be helping us don't seem to give a shit  And in the case that for some godforsaken reason this amount of pain is normal (why would the body do this!?) What can we do to help deal with that pain?

What can we do to help deal with that pain?   It has been a long time so I'm sure there are bound to be lots of awesome mods and maps around      In addition to the thing just looking like it needs some work in general, last season I started noticing that one side will get hotter than the other, so I may have to replace the burners? I got the thing for free a few years ago and it was pretty much in the same physical condition it is now but it just needed a new starter and a regulator. I never did put in a new starter out of laziness and just opted for lighting it with a match.  But spring is here and I need a project to kick off the season. All the wood needs replacing and since I'm doing that, I'd like to have fold-up shelves ([Like this](http://thumbs4.ebaystatic.com/d/l225/m/mDbbdw-d9pe5fVqEG0rmoKg.jpg)) on each side to add some space since I'm in an apartment and don't have any type of table or space out there.  I'll also end up actually putting in that starter just because it wouldn't make sense to restore the grill and not put in the starter. I'd also like to add a temperature gauge, I know there are clip-on or temporary solutions out there but I'd like to have a permanent fixture.  [Here's pictures of the damage](http://imgur.com/a/y3xS9)         My family is still on regular family plans but we were probably upgrade soon and I just saw a commercial for the "more everything" plan talking about how you get 2x data. When I calculated the cost for 5 lines with 10gb of data on the share everything plan, it was $300. The More Everything plan is the same price for 5 phones and 10gb. What gives?         For me, intentional asmr videos just make me feel weird. I like it when it just happens. A lot of the time it's in unboxing videos, I don't know why. I just came across an "unboxing" video posted on this subreddit and I figured I'd ask if anyone knows of any good unintentional ones because the intentional stuff like tapping on the box for 3 minutes straight just annoyed the hell out of me    I've owned my Mustang since I was in high school, and admittedly, I don't know a whole lot about cars, and I also don't place a lot of trust into mechanics I don't know, and the one guy I do know moved across the country. I only recently hit the 100,000 mark and I'd like to know what I can do to take care of my car myself.   A few years ago I also had this weird problem where my car would just kinda lose power while on the interstate. It happened during hotter weather and it would start up again just fine after 20 minutes. No engine lights or anything. Definitely wasn't battery because I could still use the electronic stuff, the engine just wouldn't turn over unless I let it sit for a bit. I've heard a whole range of things it could be, from the fuel filter, to the fuel pump, it could be sensors, or even vapor lock. I'm just afraid to dump a whole bunch of money into doing all that and never truly knowing if it's fixed or not unless I decide to go on a 6 hour drive in hot weather, which I'm afraid to do now.      What are your favorite places for grub?  So far all I have on my list is desperadoes, apparently they have good hot wings. The double front is also on my list, love that fried chicken. I might also go to five guys because I don't get to eat there ever. Any great local burger places? I want a delicious half pound juicy burger to fill my stomach hole.  Also since I'm already posting, check out the new subreddit /r/montanaearthporn and post your beautiful pictures of Montana.   I frequently see beautiful pictures of Montana but am always unable to find them whenever I want to show somebody the beauty of our state. If you take an awesome picture or come across one, or even a video, post it to /r/MontanaEarthPorn so we will always have the beauty of Montana at our fingertips.   I frequently see pictures posted across the different Montana subreddits. Post them here as we'll so if you ever need to show an unbeliever how beautiful our home is, you can find the best of the best within seconds!   First, I just want to say that you guys are great. I specifically visit this sub far more than other subreddits other than whatever is on my front page. A lot of what I read here inspires me to better myself as a person and with food. Granted my experience so far is in a corporate kitchen and I'm not given any opportunity to really create something, I have still gained a lot of knowledge of the industry and of food itself, for which I am extremely grateful. I've been able to expand upon the ideas I see and do my own thing at home for family and friends. I'm able to whip up dishes for my friends who say they still have dreams about how good it tasted without looking up any form of a recipe, I'm just putting ingredients together that I feel work well. I love the food industry and that's why I'm saying I'm only leaving for now, because I'll be back, and hopefully next time I will be doing what I do for my friends, except on a bigger scale, and for people I don't know.  The short of it is that in July, my wife is due to have our first child. At her job, she only makes just above minimum wage, and even then, her ability to work will be hindered by having a baby, so I've been forced to look for a better-paying job that has more family-friendly hours. I got lucky and I generally only work mornings, but there are still really busy days where I'll put in 12 hours, and not ever knowing when I'll be home for dinner isn't an ideal situation right now. But for me, the best part is that since the job I've been offered pays me double what I make now, I'm guaranteed full time hours and bigger/more frequent raises. On top of that, I'm off work at 4pm every day, and I have weekends off. With the extra money I'm making, I'll be able to pay off my own student loans much faster, and I'll be able to save up money to begin my own small venture. So this definitely isn't goodbye forever, and I'm certainly not leaving this sub because you guys are my brothers.  Thanks for taking the time to read all of this if you did. I'm basically writing stream of consciousness. I don't actually have any personal friends in the industry and nobody on my side of the family or my wife's really understand why I love working in kitchens and working with food so they don't understand how someone like me can ever truly leave. Though I'm still young so I have many years ahead of me.                For those of us on Reddit who also go to Xerq   It's a pain in the butt to shave my own head so I'd rather pay someone else to do it. I'm looking for someone who will also do facial hair the good ol' way.   I watched some of the behind the scenes stuff on the DVD and Satoshi was often up late being the only one in the office slaving away at his work. Has anyone thought that he put "himself" into the intro sequence?  [Link to relevant part of the intro](http://youtu.be/uXCoXW8lr0k?t=45s)  I love all of his work, and I had no idea that he wrote World Apartment Horror, which I saw a couple years ago and really liked, until a couple nights ago when I looked up to see what else he did that I haven't seen yet. The loss of his talent in the anime world 3 years ago was incredibly saddening   Over a year ago he decided to start clawing a wicker chest we had and to try to stop that, we got a scratching post as well as a cardboard pad. It mostly got him to stop clawing the chest but now when he does his crazy runs around the house, he stops on the stairs and claws the sides. He knows he's not supposed to do this because as soon as he sees one of us he takes off   Yeah yeah blah blah new years resolution blah blah. A couple weeks ago I started feeling like I'm too lazy and nothing would make me happier than to wake up at the asscrack of dawn and get some exercise in before I go to work. When I was in school I did the same thing before classes and it was great.  So what's the best gym in Bozeman? My wife is still going to school and I thought the $80 per semester fee since I'm married to her but that raises the problem of parking on campus and needing a parking pass too. Bus isn't an option because I typically work at 8-830am and the bus arrives at campus at 7 at the earliest.   Lately at my job hours are hard to come by. They've dropped everyone to 4 days a week in prep and since business has normalized since our restaurant first opened just under a year ago, there's less to do in prep and as a result we come in later in the morning and leave earlier. 4 days a week is fine for me as long as I get 30 hours out of it but most days I only seem to have a maximum of 6 hours of my own work to do. Some weeks we're a bit busier and I end up with 30 hours and others it's like 25-26.  I have more than a few coworkers who bitch and moan about the hours but never do everything they're supposed to, and they also don't stay and help someone whose list is a bit longer. The last couple weeks I have resorted to being the only one who stays and helps and often that person will then ask if I just want to take over the end of shift stuff and they can go, which I gladly do because I hate working less than 7 hours in a day.  On too of that, nobody does the weekly cleaning stuff which I also end up doing by myself. I don't like doing all this but it's the only way I can make sure I have enough money to pay my bills. I've already resorted to picking up a second job in case they decide to drop us to 3 days per week. Unfortunately the second job doesn't pay as well so it's definitely not an exit plan if everything goes tits up.  I love this industry and I love the work I do but I don't like needing to scavenge for hours in order to support myself and my wife, especially with a kid due in 6 months. I feel like management isn't looking at my habits too kindly and think I'm milking the clock being there longer than anyone else all the time, even though I'm the one doing the work they want us to do.  Just needed to vent some place where people might understand. None of my friends have ever worked in the industry and I've never been the type to make friends out of coworkers (not that the chance has ever presented itself)  Thanks for all the hard work I know the rest of you guys are doing. This is my favorite subreddit to visit. It's like we're one big drunken family.   I can't seem to find the post about it, but I made a reminder for myself on my phone but don't even remember what the site was   I'm going to be upgrading soon on Verizon. The folks over at /r/lgg2 [gave a convincing argument](http://www.reddit.com/r/lgg2/comments/1szxe6/why_did_you_or_why_should_i_choose_the_g2_over_an/). Now it's your turn. I could compare specs and read reviews but I like to hear from people who use them every single day. Not people who get to play around with a phone for a week or two, write a review and move onto the next big thing.   I'm on Verizon and will most likely upgrading soon and I'm on the fence for what I should get but the G2 interests me the most so far.   I work in a kitchen and we get a fair amount of to-go orders, especially large ones that require entire gallons of soup. When there is a large order the person in charge of the to-go stuff is supposed to tell the kitchen staff about it and we get everything ready. When there is a large order like that, it takes away from the soup that was meant for the dining area so we have to make sure there is enough warming up so we don't run out for the guests.  However, one person has made a habit of not telling anyone about the giant to-go orders and putting them in the computer last minute as if they didn't require any extra attention than regular orders, and on top of that, she justs takes the amount of soup she needs from the hot wells that are there for the servers to get soup for the dine-in guests. She has done this at least twice now, and every time I don't say anything about the soup, I just refill the hot-wells after she's done and I let her make more work for herself         I first got "into" bitcoin about 2 years ago when bitcoin was about $5-10 each. I started mining with my gpu on slush's pool and got to 1 bitcoin and had it sent to my wallet. I then raised the threshold to 10 bitcoins, but I only got to 2.88 bitcoins before I lost my interest because at the time (and even now) I don't have a lot of money and couldn't afford to replace my gpu if it died an early life from being ran at 100% for so long, especially with bitcoins being as cheap as they were.  So here's where I made my 3 essential mistakes:  1: I didn't pay attention to what I was doing  2: I left bitcoins in the mining pool account  3: I didn't continue mining  I got a new larger SSD and backed up some stuff onto an external and wiped the old one for a fresh install of windows. I didn't realize that I didn't make sure to back up my wallet until months later, but by that time I didn't really care too much. I did backup my entire windows profile though (I'm sure you see where this is going). So I spent the last year and a half thinking that bitcoin was gone as I watched the price of bitcoin climb, climb, and climb some more, getting a little more upset at each hurdle, but still thinking "well at least I still have that 2.88 bitcoins"  So then I fast forward to about a week or so ago when bitcoin flew past 700+. I think "oh I should log into slush's pool" and what do I find when I log in? an empty balance. Somehow someone took my coins! Now that was really devastating, but I only have myself to blame for not making sure I transferred those funds to my own wallet.  But tonight I had a spark of dumb genius luck. I tried doing data recovery on my old SSD with low hopes since that computer has been in use for so long, the data has likely been overwritten. Obviously I found nothing. I give up and lie down in bed, but I can't sleep still. So I get up and plug my external in and start searching, and what else do I find but a bitcoin folder in my appdata folder, and what's this? it contains a bitcoin.dat! All this time I assumed that the bitcoin.dat was contained in the program files directory, not appdata! So first thing I do is backup my current wallet.dat, and put this one in its place and rescan with bitcoin-qt. After scanning, the program opens and my first 1BTC is sitting right before my eyes, back in my possession after all this time.  It's kindof a bittersweet ending, because yeah, I still am out 2.88BTC, and the full amount could have paid for half of the debt I'm in, and I'm sure if I waited out longer, I could have paid it all off in full which would have been great because all the money going towards bills could be put back into investing in bitcoin. But not all is lost, and I'm definitely being more careful from here on out.   I need quite a bit of space for video recording/editing and I waited until black friday deals to do it      Bosses wanted someone to do some extra prep work tomorrow to make sure we have most of our main sauces and soup made so we have enough to start the day with on Friday. We're closed on Thanksgiving so no prep work will be done that day so if I don't, whoever is in charge of sauces will have a real rough day. So instead of working a few hours at my second job and in general having a relaxing day before I spend a whole day in my own kitchen, I will now be bumbling into work at 5:30am, get off at 10:30, run to my other job, work there, and then be worn out and probably not get as much of my own prep work done that I wanted to on Wednesday.  I don't know when to stop working guys            More specifically, using their $45/mo plan with 4G through ATT's towers? I'm currently on a plan with my parents on Verizon and I have unlimited data. The rest of my family want to use their upgrades and that means I'll lose my unlimited due to the share everything plans. So instead of paying more for less, I'm going to get the Nexus 5 and port my number to Straight Talk. I'm just wondering how the service is in the Bozeman area   Both Sprint and Tmobile are not available in my area. I'm currently on Verizon with my family, but my dad wants to switch to the share everything plan (and I'm the only one with unlimited data). So by that I'll lose my unlimited data and end up paying the same amount of money for less data. Straight talk has supposedly unlimited everything for $45/month which is only $5 more than what I pay now.  What would the process even be to switch from my Galaxy Nexus on Verizon, getting a Nexus 5, and hopping on Straight Talk and keeping my same number?              	146
 Contestants go through different trials with weapons they made themselves out of Lego only. If the weapon breaks during a trial, the contestant is disqualified. Trials may include timed challenges, tests of strength, and even contestant-on-contestant close combat.    Bread + Nutella   Pretty accurate!   Honestly, what I miss most is just a genuine interest in being with me/around me. I don't consider myself particularly outgoing, or funny, or any other quality someone would want to be around. So now I rather miss that.  That being said, the reason we broke up is because I moved to a different country for school and work. We probably could have had something nice if I'd realized it at the time.    You can allow extensions in incognito mode.   Yes! I do the same :D   Yes. Let's do it!   Came here to post that same solution. Works miracles when I need to get stuff done.   Two Space Marines walk into a bar. There is no counter.   A dyslexic man walks into a bra.   Empathy is such a valuable skill that makes such a big difference. Couldn't agree more :)   There is only one thing we say to the God of Homework: "not today"   So true. I've been told that many times [unfortunately]   Whoa man. Just... whoa   So try everything twice?   3   All men must die? That's a grim motto to live by...   Smells like awesome   YOLO is considerably shorter than FI,IGTDA.  	19

 Can't you just download the APK and install it on an Android phone/tablet? I'm sure the package is floating around somewhere.   I don't think the issue is really with Iraq, but rather the spillover caused by major fuckups on all sides in Syria. ISIS would never have existed/broken away from AQ if the Syrian conflict would have been resolved quickly.   Here's another morsel for thought: Hong Kong has massive demonstrations every year (especially on Tiananmen), but China lets them do it. Do you really think they would even try to stop them in 30 years when the "50 year limit" is up? Massive demonstrations would ensue and the Chinese government will lose its legitimacy.   I don't think this really matters in the long term. Hong Kong's cultural identity is independence. You'd have to kill off generations of native Hong Kongers for them to lose it. Even migrant workers move there because of the opportunity and because it's "not China". The second they try to erase that from Hong Kong is the moment they lose legitimacy in the eyes of the people. You'll see mass demonstrations and civil unrest, which the Chinese government does not want and would not be able to control in the mass media.  Simply put, China is deathly allergic to civil unrest, and there is no way to completely impose Communist rule without creating utter chaos in the region.   Stimulating the immune system is going to be one of the big things in the coming years.  Here's an amazing result presented at ASCO with pembrolizumab, which helps to re-activate the immunity-based antitumor system: http://www.ascopost.com/ViewNews.aspx?nid=16291. My impression is that these types of drugs are probably broadly applicable and could become standard of care for all patients.   I think it really depends on what Boehner's (and the future whip's) goals are -- whether it is to maintain establishment control of the House or to win the national election. The facts are that many primary challenges from the Tea Party already come from solid Republican states that would not affect the result of the national election. However, moderate reforms like immigration overhaul can be forced through an non-election year like 2015 while maintaining the Hastert rule. These types of actions can pull many of the slightly left-leaning purple states back into play. Even though Democrats are going to get pummeled in 2014, they currently have a massive structural advantage in winning the national election (with or without Clinton). The establishment Republicans know this, and the question is whether they are willing to sacrifice a significant amount of house seats in order to survive nationally.  Personally, I don't think Boehner or any high-level politician really gives a shit about some random House member who is afraid of actually having to campaign hard for their seat. What they might anticipate is that by passing bills that are more moderate, they can also win House seats in purple districts to buffer any new Tea Party members that may get elected. It would come out even in the end, and the Republican Party would have a net gain in their White House chances.   My bet is that Boehner is going to be more aggressive about pushing his (more moderate) agenda after the 2014 midterms. The impression I got was that he was worried about Cantor taking his job, but with him gone there is nobody else in the House that could possibly challenge him for Speaker.   Why would Democrats do that? It's not like picking up seats in the House will mean anything this cycle.   I'm sure that the "establishment Republicans" are shitting their pants right now after winning several primaries a few weeks ago. Boehner must be pretty happy, though.   It's a completely different medium though. Storytelling in Hollywood has to be done in between 2-3 hours, whereas shows like GoT and True Detective have 10 hours in a single season.   The issue is that for decades (even in the 90s and 2000s!), a college degree statistically led to much higher future incomes -- much more so than a 2-year or vocation. The problem is that the recession in the late 2000s caused an unemployment shock, and created scars in companies where they are less likely to take someone who is "green". The student loan thing was never a problem given a decent job, but wage stagnation coupled with reticient hiring has made the problem really bad.   You should qualify that statement with: good schools without significant financial aid.  There are many elite schools that pile on the aid in terms of housing and tuition. Princeton undergrad is free. Harvard is free if your family makes less than 80k, and then it's a VERY modest percentage of family income. On the flip side, there are plenty of elite liberal arts colleges and public universities that don't have competitive financial aid packages, and that's where you will see increasing numbers of rich folk (because everyone else can't afford it).   The Canadian government has said it will announce new plans for a more focused and effective pilot program for immigrant investors in the coming months.  Let's hold our judgment until we see this.   Did the judges taste it?   There are a lot of oral insulin therapies currently in clinical trials. Many of them have tags (peptide or chemical) that are attached to recombinant insulin. I'd say that is more of a solvable problem than making a pill.   The only problem is that seeding guts with genetically modified bacteria has never been done and is probably going to have a hard time at the FDA. Theoretically you could functionally cure type I diabetes by engineering E. coli to express recombinant insulin with specific molecular triggers (eg. some kind of sugar alcohol or drug inducer) and have it live in the gut. Many types of insulin on the market today are recombinant, so it's not a matter of capability -- it's a matter of the FDA flipping its shit when you produce a "living medicine".   People are way too religious on filmmakers and screenwriters. There are only a select few who consistently make great movies. Having a change of staff before a single thing has been filmed will not ruin the movie.   Likewise, I'm reserving my judgment until the movie actually comes out. Marvel has a great track record, and it could be that the original Ant-Man script actually sucked. Everyone's willing to jump down Marvel's throat but it's not that directors or screenwriters have a 100% record either.   I think people wouldn't mind if reasonable and effective security measures were implemented by highly trained professionals. The problem is that most institutions in this country work on the "lowest common denominator" principle, which means they will do the worst type of work they can get away with (in this case, billions of dollars).   It's stupid because these school administrators are all about eliminating any kind of liability, and yet in the process of doing so they cause a child to get a sunburn which they are liable for because they banned sunscreen. Imagine if the child were even more light-skinned and got a blistering burn.   Too bad she's been completely absent in the season post Purple Wedding...   I wouldn't even recommend seeing that movie on DVD. Honestly, there was no plot and maybe 20 minutes of monster battles.   Can't you carry some liquid energy with you to sip on at mile 20? Or is that considered cheating?   Will this have feature parity with Android devices? I hope they have a Gmail, Maps, and Hangouts replacement.   Her acting's been really off the entire season (and maybe the past one too). It just seems like she's phoning it in, compared to the other actors on the show.   Intermittent fasting is actually what they called it in the article! Apparently it's really good for establishing portion self-control.   Jack will never die. If ratings/ad revenue are good then they will always hold the option of making another season.   Does anyone else think that she looks like a female version of Odo?   The question is, do YOU feel like you're settling if the guy isn't perfect looking? If you do, then you're setting some impossible standards for yourself and your future partners. I'm far from perfect looking, but do I ever think that my long-term girlfriend/fiance is settling for me? Of course not, and I too never feel like I'm settling for her. You would develop serious trust and insecurity issues if you carry this mentality with you. Relationships are not pie charts, checklists, points systems, zero-sum games, or pro/con tallies of traits -- your partner is one person that you have to consider as a whole in their entirety.   It was surprisingly not a terrible movie! It was a solidly mediocre action flick. Highly recommended.   I'm a scientist, and starting to dabble a bit in Python. My background is in MATLAB, which is not exactly fast. I was surprised at how *slow* Python was, given that tons of scientists recommend it!   There was an article recently in the NYT that showed a new method of "dieting" where you basically "fast" every second day. One day you eat normally, and the second day you basically just skip breakfast and have a small lunch. People who were put on that regimen were able to keep on it longer, and they actually ate less on their normal days! Those people said that they got used a larger "range" of what hunger felt like, so small pangs no longer lead to binge eating.   When Starbucks came out with their blonde roast that was the joke of the day for the whole year!   Here is the magical coffee maker that will beat anything you get out of a college coffee shop: http://www.amazon.com/Melitta-Ready-Single-Coffee-Brewer/dp/B0014CVEH6/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8 qid=1401696468 sr=8-1 keywords=melitta+coffee+cone  Buy a large airtight mason jar and store your coffee in a cool dark place. Get some nice beans and pregrind them to a "Melitta" grain size, which is very fine. You might think I'm crazy for suggesting pre-grind, but the fact is that (a) you will be going through the beans quickly, and (b) any decent grinder you buy will be very expensive and won't match an industrial grinder's evenness or quality. I have never noticed any difference in quality from preground beans that were stored for a few weeks.  Get a water kettle and a measuring spoon. Tailor the amount of grounds you add in to your taste. I usually do 3 tbsp for a cup of coffee. You'll need the #2 filters from Trader Joe's.  Edit: also, don't get a porcelain coffee cone unless you like wasting your time heating it up.   Disagree on the French press. It makes the flavors and textures all muddled. If you want clean distinctive flavors, you should go with the pourover method. It's basically drip coffee, yes, but the advantage is that you have complete control over the flow rate and temperature. The reason why autodrips make awful coffee is that the water never gets hot enough.   I think the problem is that bagels get stale way faster than other bread products. Loaves of bread can last a long time, but two days is probably the maximum for bagels.  Edit: that said, you'd probably have an easier time if you turned them into bagel chips!   It's a comic book (movie). They can retcon or futcon anything. They do it in the comic books all the goddamn time.   Do you think it's genetic or from upbringing? I know lots of toddlers/kids who are picky eaters, but there are some who will eat (and enjoy!) anything.   Many crops that you eat today are the product of UV/gamma ray mutagenesis. This never occurred in nature either.  Similarly, a lot of popular fruits were made by grafting plants on each other. That never occurs in nature.  The fact of the matter is that practically 100% of the food that we eat has been changed so much by humans that you wouldn't even be able to recognize their ancestral forms -- even if you go back several hundred years.   You forget corn. Its ancestral forms were so WTF that I'm surprised Native Americans kept it around for that long.  In terms of modern (eg. 20th century) science, people "created" new strains by mutagenesis. They would literally bombard crops with UV/gamma radiation, plant them in fields exposed to the environment, and see what came out. For those who are worried about health and environmental concerns, this is far more risky. But of course, the USDA approved these foods rather than the FDA. For some reason, whole-scale genetic changes are OK but changing/inserting several genes is not.  We have the power of hindsight to show that broad-scale/coarse mutagenesis methods are safe. Nobody ever seriously thought that this would be dangerous to the public. While the safety concern in GMO food is strain-specific, we should treat it with appropriate and proportional scrutiny, not hysteria.   Usually you don't have to pay a dime for these kinds of lawsuits. You're suing for damages + lawyer fees.   Pro-tip: apparently Brita filters can turn shitty vodka into pretty decent ones.   It can definitely fit. You just have to squeeze the sandwich harder. Most of the vertical space is the vegetables and the bun. The patty itself isn't any thicker than a regular steak after it's been cooked.   Really? That seems like a lot of water for a quick steam...   I love the way he explains everything: "You gotta put butter on the bun because it's shit without it." No BS. It just tastes good.   For sure! I was in a pretty tough program in undergrad, and we always had group homework sessions. It's a waste of time to do homework by yourself when you can ask your peers/TAs for help. Most professors are very supportive of this because it encourages collaborative learning, but keep in mind that working together could easily lead to copying assignments -- and most students succumb to the latter even with the best intentions. It will bite them in the ass eventually but they do it anyway.   Also, do your homework. It's amazing how your exam grades improve when you don't have to learn everything the night before.    This is why I hate "showy" cakes like this one, because I'll have to pick off all the fondant before I can even get a decent bite of cake!   Where at? I might have to move to NYC now.   I know right? "Why are you talking to me? Can't you see I'm eating a sandwich?"   IMO, it wasn't even worth the $8.50 student discount price that I paid. Godzilla was on the screen for maybe 15 minutes, and the other monsters just flew around and didn't do shit. Not to mention the huge plot-holes. I could forgive all that if there were lots of monster-Godzilla fights, but most of the time it just cut away to another scene! Especially during the Hawaii scene when they first start fighting! WTF was that? It just cut to the next day and the MUTO had ran off with no explanation!  Pacific Rim I could forgive, because it was exactly what I expected. Godzilla had no plot and no action.   That's amazing. As a cyclist in the Bay Area, I'm so happy that cyclists were one of their test cases. There are just too many drivers here that don't pay attention!   THANK YOU. Godzilla was awful. I saw it last week and couldn't believe the gushing comments on the official Reddit discussion thread.   Jack Reacher was pretty much the best mediocre "serious" action movie. Usually the ones without comedy take themselves too seriously, but this movie hit all the right notes.   Yeah, there are plenty of American cities with an extremely high proportion of attractive people. Just go to the cities with a lower average age, eg. places with young professionals and students. Places like SF, LA, San Diego, Seattle, Portland, Boston, NYC, Chicago, Phoenix, Miami... this is also where over 50% of the country live too!      What? I've only heard it being called P N A S. The only ones who pronounce it wrong were the non-academics...   Does anyone know if these birds can see the infrared beam that comes out of the motion sensor? If they could then it's a little less impressive.   I think I'm probably the only guy on Reddit who buys CoD solely for the campaign. At 30 years old, I don't have the time nor skills to go gun-to-gun with teenagers on the internet. I happen to think that the campaigns have been getting steadily better too! The only exception would be Ghosts -- that campaign was excellent, but was just way too short.   Yes, very sharp edges can cause damage without you feeling it. Once I cut my thumb pretty deep with a razor blade but didn't notice anything until my hand was covered with blood.   Dad joke or not, that one was pretty good.   Actually, IF could be easily done if you eat dinner at 6pm and go to bed at midnight. That's automatically 14 hours. If you skip breakfast, you've already done ~18.   There's an article on NYT that says that long-term intermittent fasting (eg. eating way less every other day) is more sustainable versus dieting. Apparently it also mentally trains you to fight against hunger signals too, so you start to eat less on your normal days.   If you are a scientist, Wolfram Alpha saves you a lot of time by doing unit conversions automatically!   Easily One Hour Photo or Insomnia.   Holy fuck, that sounds amazing!!!   Lack? I don't think a doener kebab done in the German style exists in North America! I've searched far and wide and found nothing.   In addition to the neat drugs coming out (especially imatinib for CML comes to mind), cancer can be curative if it is caught very early and is in an organ amenable to surgery. If you can take it out before it metastasizes, in many cases the cancer is eliminated. Things like early stage colorectal cancer comes to mind (get your screenings done!).   The stupid thing was that the new Google Maps was not "feature complete" until much later. Off the top of my head I can't think of anything new in Google Maps that blows the old one out of the water. Take Google Hangouts too, for example. In most cases it is 99% the same as Google Talk. It took them over a year to even get any kind of reasonable unified messaging going on. The first few versions were so goddamn slow for no reason. Now they finally have a version that works better but drains battery life. It's as if they can't help but break the wheel.   What features? The old Google Maps had 99% of the ones that you needed. Some are completely useless, like the timeshifting frame when you're looking at public transit schedules. That thing is a goddamn UX nightmare, but on the old version it was perfect.   A friend of mine dated this guy for a while who only wanted to date/sleep with virgins, and (no joke) found anyone who didn't fit that "standard" to be disgusting. It wasn't a religious thing either -- he was just some white dude going to a pretty good law school to give you an idea to his age. I guess there are no limits to assholery.   Probably overkill, but when I work with RNA I always open up a new box of tips.   January Jones was also in that Liam Neeson movie I think. Totally ruined it.   If they added in a tiny laser diode and buttons for slide advancement, this thing would sell like hotcakes to the business crowd.   How would that work? Aren't the old covers made for a smaller screen?   I think part of their strategy now is to iterate quickly and accordingly make small batches of the units so they won't run into a Surface 1 debacle. Sell them at a loss/break even but refresh them quickly to keep up with the tech news cycle and build up to what consumers want. Honestly, by doing this they get a lot of goodwill from the tech crowd. It shows that they are actually listening to complaints and addressing them in later releases.   Actually, I don't think an i7 1080p+ laptop with 8GB RAM and 512GB SSD would even be priced at $1949. This is very competitive pricing from Microsoft, although I wish they would throw in the type cover as a bundle if you buy them together.   Here's a related question: why are you buying the SP3 as a basic office/netflix machine when an Atom powered Windows tablet does exactly the same thing?   I just found out they are moving out of their Stanford location... WTF   Postdoc and former TA here. We don't give a shit if you are late with your homework or assignments, but we will be offended if you are dishonest about it.   Wow, nice! There are a lot of things that Excel can do that are a huge pain in the ass for python. This is speaking as a guy who lives and breathes MATLAB. Excel is excellent for a lot of edge cases, and having that crosstalk is another nice tool in the box.'  Edit: $99 :(   The other last thing under his governorship was to have an open primary system!   Holy shit, that's video was practically pre-youtube... I didn't know that was WKUK!      If FODMAPs are really the culprit, then it really begs the question of whether the specific cause is of microbial imbalance. After all, histology on Celiac-negative patients show no obvious signs of a physiological response, so the only thing that would cause gastrointestinal upset would be the microflora.   Once you're finished with that, check out The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks, and then The Philadelphia Chromosome.   Umm.... plastic is organic too. Dead dinosaurs and oil.      At this time last year or even two years ago, getting 1000 comments on a thread was a *huge* deal. Now we see regular AskReddit threads going into the 5-10k range.   I think this is something that PIs should advertise too, especially if they have a very comfortable pad of money that they are sitting on. Many graduate students and postdocs generally will have never heard of any given professor, but they are more likely to work for someone if funding is stable and they have the spending freedom to do something ambitious!   I mean, besides having superheroes, how are any of the Iron Man movies similar to Thor? or to Captain America? These are the three "solo" franchises that Marvel is actively producing, and they are very different films.   Marvel also had the great idea of tying all their disparate superhero franchises together, and added teaser trailers to the end of each movie. What ends up happening is that you get a great sense of cohesion, even though these movies are nothing alike.   Have you seen the trailer for Constantine? It looks like a pile of shit. Probably cancelled before the end of the season.   Have you seen the trailer for the Constantine TV show? What the fuck is that.   Or, you know, they could have graduated already.   My favorite example was how imatinib (Gleevec) was invented. The hurdle wasn't due to a lack of knowledge -- we knew the structure of the site to target -- but rather the most difficult part was to convince Novartis to take the risk with a Phase I clinical trial. What we really lack is the capability to test the effectiveness of drugs in vivo on a massive scale. There are tons of molecules where we see a significant "biological" effect, but we have no way to screen for their bioavailability or in vivo effects without going into an animal model.   With regards to nutrition, I think you are perpetuating a myth that we "don't have a handle" on it. It is quite the contrary -- we know the vast majority of risky lifestyles that substantially reduce lifespan and increase death rate. The medical literature is quite conclusive and is muddied by fad diets and lifestyles, The rest regarding antioxidants and vitamins, are indeed "dotting the is and crossing the ts" so to speak. The factors with the largest effect size and statistical significance have been solved for decades.   I think the outcome depends on the restaurant. Certainly this law wouldn't make a difference for downscale places where tips aren't gratuitous. However this would effectively reduce the number of people who would want to work at a high-end restaurant, because the obscene tips effectively bumps them up to a higher pay grade. What is eventually going to happen is that the high-end restaurant itself is going to have to start offering higher wages in order to attract staff, which means higher upfront prices on the menu.  Personally, I think it all comes out even, but the major difference in the previous case is that the tips all go to the service staff anyway (and maybe people behind the scenes too) -- that kind of income is often protected against the business owner. In this new case, the restaurant pockets the increase in prices and doles out what would be the lowest effective wage that the high-end restaurant labor market would bear. In this scenario, there's a chance that business owners can end up making a nice chunk of money and screwing the staff because there's no such thing as a food service sector union to negotiate fair wages.   Your friend is missing a crucial point though -- you can't make blanket statements about medicines, since their mechanisms of action are so disparate. You have salicylic acid and artemesinin, two plant-derived drugs that are first-line use, but you also have a ton of other plant-derived molecules that can't be used in people without significant modification. These kinds of generalized statements about drugs and medicines are unfortunately convenient because they don't require much critical thought, but the fact is that you have to look at everything on a case by case basis.   Add onto that the **type of knowledge** that we have is very different today then it was back then. There's still a lot to be discovered and a lot of uncertainty, but it is not in the same areas as 50-400 years ago. We are capable of more critical thinking today than in the entire history of civilization, so it's not useful at all to generalize.   Doubt it. The reason why drugs in the first half of the 20th century was that people knew very little about organic chemistry and how drugs interacted with the body. We're in the age of molecular medicine, so many drugs that are discovered today will probably stick around for a long time. What we are lacking today is very different from back then. Today, drug development is more of a lack of capability than a lack of knowledge.    Seriously. At 7' tall you could load the tallest chromatography column in the world without breaking a sweat.   Yale might not have been a bad choice if the kid wasn't really into ball. All of the elite colleges give significant financial aid or are free anyway. With Stanford you'd be practicing all the time, but Yale would give him more free time.   Seriously. Stanford would be the perfect balance for him.   No shit. He just has to keep up his grades and apply to Stanford. Great basketball team and stellar education.   How the fuck can Applebees be better than Red Robin? That's not even possible.   Al Madrigal is easily the funniest of the correspondents, but Larry Wilmore is pretty good.    Have you tried ATCC?  	107
                         Reading books on an iPad and similar e-readers in the evening may disturb sleep patterns because of the type of light the device emits, scientists said.         Pasta maker Barilla is no stranger to having 3D printing improve its methods for churning out products for the masses.      The use of UPC and EAN numbers has become so widespread that most retailers refuse to carry/sell a product without a UPC/EAN number. Most stores (online or otherwise) use whats called a POS (point of sale) system. Basically, this is the point or place where a purchasing transaction occurs and money is exchanged for a service or product. This generally occurs at the register or check out location.                     This collection of fiction features eight very different stories, each showcasing Wilhites considerable talent and vast knowledge of the horror genre.                                                                  This is a story of a doctor named Ben Givens who was recently diagnosed with terminal colon cancer. He has three months to live, and intends to travel east of the mountains to end his life on his own terms.      The term electrostatics means the charges are either stationary or move very slowly with respect to each other.       Astronauts on the International Space Station using their 3-D printer to make a wrench from instructions sent up in the e-mail. Quite a marker for things to come? An object, after all, was designed on Earth and then transmitted to space for manufacture, indicating such events may have an impact on the economics of supply and demand for space missions.                           The modest-sounding snailfish has broken all previous records by swimming deeper than any other creature.      A beautiful story told by a master storyteller, the book Girl in the Glass is about Renaissance. The Author, Susan Meissner, gave very clear descriptions of Florence in her book which kind of makes one feel like they were physically present in real time during all the trips Sophia and Meg had and you also get to learn a few things about the Medici Family.            Mojang, the maker of Minecraft, has teamed up with another developer to create a narrative-based version of the incredibly popular block-based game.      Smith was able to extend his overnight score of 65 past 100 due to the ample assistance he was given by the free-scoring Mitchell Johnson (88), before the tail kept Australia's momentum going.      Atoms of niobium and nitrogen in an ultrathin superconducting film that helped MIT researchers discover a universal law of superconductivity.         Kepler's new life began with a 9-day test in February 2014. When Vanderburg and his colleagues analyzed that data, they found that Kepler had detected a single planetary transit.      Two days before the storms struck, five golden-winged warblers skipped town, traveling nearly 700 kilometers south to the Florida coast. (One bird flew as far as Cuba.)                Amazon.com launched a service Thursday that promises one-hour delivery of household products to its Prime customers in Manhattan.      Reading 'The Casual Vacancy' was like walking in oblivion where you just give up trying to determine the kind of direction that you want to go to.       Why does toothpaste give orange juice a weird aftertaste? Its one of many surprisingly easy ways to trick your tongue  and your brain  into experiencing strange flavours, says Veronique Greenwood. What's going on?      Modernism is a time in our history when traditional values began to change and literature became an outlet for the troubled and rebellious souls. Modernism attempted to rethink science, art, culture, ethics, philosophy and psychology. It attempted to the find new or hidden meaning in the human experience and had to deal with coming to terms with new ideas.         Air pollution may double a pregnant woman's risk of having a child with autism, according to a study published December 18 in Environmental Health Perspectives.         A lens-free microscope that can be used to detect the presence of cancer or other cell-level abnormalities with the same accuracy as larger and more expensive optical microscopes, has been developed by researchers.      NASAs Curiosity rover has sniffed out methane in Mars atmosphere. And that means that something, whether living or not, is actively creating the gas on Mars.      IBM announced a continued expansion of its global cloud computing network to 40 cloud centers with 12 new locations serving a growing roster of enterprise clients looking to move to hybrid cloud computing.      Australian Rohan Dennis will attempt to claim cycling's fabled hour record early next year amid reports countryman Jack Bobridge will also launch a bid.      Australian users report that the biggest attractions for using tablets are their portability (91%) and light weight (88%). The additional product offering of smaller screen tablet devices, such as the iPad mini, further facilitates portability. Another popular reason for using tablets is their ease of use (88%), particularly for users over 55.               The problem for the video was that since the counter ran using a 32-bit integer, YouTube ran out of characters to count the views, which it does in binary. Computers use a similar system to count away from 1970  when modern computers think of time as beginning  and will run out of space when the year 2038 arrives.           	104

 You doin' ok OP? Any news for us?   How can we help?   You could just add it to this one to avoid the post ban. I had to do that a couple times when I posted about my son.   Maybe you're just an asshole?   I... I think you're dead. I don't know how you're posting on nosleep but the crying, the being ignored like you're not there, etc. Were you in any kind of accident or did anything strange happen? Any missing time?    Yeah... I know we're supposed to believe this stuff but...   Creepy but won't scar you for life. Promise.   It is SO not your fault. Accidents happen. You didn't do anything wrong. Also, I'm sorry you're having a hard time with your transition. It's this awful cycle where being in the wrong body makes you depressed and being depressed makes you unsuitable for T and surgery, which makes you more depressed, etc. I hope you hang in there OP. Feel free to PM me if you wanna talk. I have a little experience. Not in the dead guy department but in the trans department.   What did it say?! Why isn't she feeling well?   Don't jump OP. You're safe now.   I had this theory but I haven't been able to figure it out myself. Op's username spelled on the keyboard of a phone could spell KNOCK with an extra letter. Op sent me : 42764440. I don't know if I'm patient enough to figure out what all the numbers could mean but maybe if it's a group effort? Edit - for this cipher to work, the 1's don't mean anything.    Is it possible you watched something that happened in the past play out again? What is the history of the building?   Kaskistentie, Finland?   I'm seriously gonna need to watch Preppers. Everyone keeps talking about it.    Your username.   Stop panicking. You're going to be okay you just have to stay calm and be logical. Make a list of things you need: food, water, etc. Then make a list of ways to get those things. You're alone there so what about taking what you need and keeping track of it so you can repay it? That would ease your conscience. Better yet if the store computer systems are working, scan your items, go through the process on screen, and print yourself a receipt. As for fuel for your car, there are tanks underground in the parking lot of most gas stations. They're covered by manhole covers which you can lift and drop a bucket into the tank to get fuel. It's easier than siphoning.   Edit: PM me if you need someone to talk to/more advice. I'm always here.  Edit 2: Go to a camping or sports store or even some hardware type of place and get a wind up flashlight with electrical outlets on it. You can wind the handle to charge your phone in case of loss of electricity. This is a must and needs to be done asap so you can keep in contact.   If you can get to a gas station, you can lift the covers and drop a bucket into the underground tanks. They all have access covers so they can do dips to check the level in the holding tank. Usually on a far side of the parking lot without a lot of parking spaces around it. It's easier than siphoning but be careful of sparks or any source of ignition.   Keep in touch with the meatball guy and hang tough. It's gonna be okay. Find something to eat, try not to drink too much alcohol. Post a link to this story in the comments of the other one so we can keep of track of both.    Writing was good but I'm left very confused.   I thought I was the only one who still said stay frosty.   Upvote for relevant username/comment. Hand with claws, [TALON]company91 suggests other side of story. I read too much. Sorry. Still upvoting though because I talk too much.   I've eaten four gaviscon foam tab thingies in the last hour because of my incredible heartburn. Why the hell did I read this?   Please keep us updated with anything new OP! I don't think you're in any danger right now though.   Burn it. Burn it asap. Then salt the ashes.   Any news on your situation? If you're experiencing something similar you should post it/keep us updated so we can try to help.   Any news on your situation?   We only have to believe OP's stuff. Not random commenters with obviously fake stuff!   I wish. I can't wait much longer.   Chill out. They just meant that a lot of us just skim the "New" page and read the titles that stand out to us. That's all. No one is ignoring you and it's not that we don't care about your wife's welfare. We do. We just don't all see posts all the time. There's an online database of medical professionals who are lifestyle-friendly. Check out fetlife.com groups. Someone can ALWAYS help. Maybe you both should talk to someone. Good luck. I hope everything turns out okay.   What about telling us in some sort of coded message? Nosleepers are awesome at codes. Or even giving us the name of a piece of your art we could google to find your name and then go from there? Something not direct, something that may not work, ya know? I think anything is worth a shot at this point. Good luck OP. Stay safe.   So no mold then? :(   Oh. My. God. I haven't seen gibberish like that since the mold! And the title... ROT 13. No way.    Thank you! I knew there was something there!   In this vein I've also heard that sterling silver can help ward things off. Sterling jewelry is usually quite inexpensive and readily available. I can't speak to it's efficacy though, it's just something I've heard.   I actually agree with you 100%. My son is 7 and even for being really smart and witty, the kid just can not lie to me. He has said things a few times that I've had a hard time believing but he's almost always right about whatever it was.   OP, I believe your daughter. Don't push about the mug. Ask her if her friends took the pictures, how she met them, when she sees them, etc. Maybe also don't leave the younger daughter alone with her for a little while, just in case. Not because she'll hurt her but because the friends might.   In fear of having weird stuff start happening to me, I'm too interested to not help. The numbers. Has anyone looked at their cell phone lately? 5 (JKL) 6 (MNO) 1 is blank so a space I assume, and 2 (ABC). Can anyone make a word or three words I guess out of those letters? Even if it's just a sound or something?  Edit: More thoughts. The number is an OCLC number in the worldcat.org library system. It's for a mircofilm. I'm gonna include a link just in case Cymon and Iphigenia is somehow relevant. http://www.worldcat.org/title/cymon-and-iphigenia-painted-by-sir-frederick-leighton-the-story-of-the-picture-illustrated/oclc/561621561   I literally have no idea how to help you. But you really need to see a doctor about your sore. Please update us again soon.   Anything new in the last few hours?   Agreed!   Leopard print bandaid FTW! I thought I was paranoid too.   Yeah. I assumed they were drinking. The last guy talked about beer a fair bit in his comments.   Keep posting them here just make one account and get all your dates to post from the same one, in the same post. That way it looks like a "saga" and the mods don't delete it for not being a story.   I like rules. They keep me from being dead. Unlike Eldon. And Warren.   I suggest if you have a message you'd like passed on to family or friends, you post it as a comment here and then shut down the account before she can.    Yeah. You're done for. Let us know if you make it out alive, but I have my doubts.   Oh my god. Men are idiots.  We're not paranoid, we're trying to save you.  You can get laid any time if you get out of there but you won't be fucking much if you're dead!   It's only been 46 minutes....   Why wait? Why not just listen to us and get out of there? You're probably not even Eldon anymore. The winky face in the last post meant it was Mal posting.   I think I sped it up by trying to warn him.  	48
 subreddit for 2 years   Fun fact: more boys are born than girls, but as they get older the trend reverses.    Did they not completely fabricate the murder for hire charge which was enough to get him the negative media attention before the charges were dropped?  No. One out of 6 hits was set up by the agents, although it wasn't fabricated; Ulbricht did order them. The other 5 are not known to be by the corrupt agents.   Most of the bitcoins were lost well before then. See http://blog.wizsec.jp/2015/04/the-missing-mtgox-bitcoins.html   Source?    Turns out the agents involved in bringing silk road down were actually involved in more criminal activity than DPR himself  How do you calculate *more* criminal activity?       If I can still affect it after you've already collapsed the measurement, that would seem problematic, especially if "you" and "I" refer to things the size of people.  But "I" and "You" can't communicate with each other. As far as I'm concerned, you haven't collapsed yet and are in a superposition.  You raise a good point that this may set a lower bound on how large superpositions can grow before they collapse; of course in non-Copenhagen interpretations this is irrelevant. I don't think this experiment proved it in anything near the size of a person, though.  I think defining "observer" is still an outstanding problem, but I'm just a layman. Do you know of any decent not-too-technical descriptions available about the progress of figuring out "what causes the collapse" so to speak?  I'm also a laymen, but try https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/9857/what-is-an-observer-in-quantum-mechanics and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observer_(quantum_physics).       Then goodbye causality  Why?  And who is this "you" of which you speak?  This can be any observer, does not require consciousness.  That is the hard problem of the Copenhagen interpretation.  You'll note I worded my comment to not require Copenhagen ...    You started talking about free market motivation of black markets and his philosophy and now you are just parsing words just to make a point .  I disagreed with what you said above, and said so.  If you have anything else to add please do so in the form of a logical discussion.  I think you are incorrect in your claim above that he "knew it was wrong", and I'd like you to either retract that statement or defend it.       It's a distinction without a difference in this case. So he knew he was doing something illegal, ergo he got caught and is going to jail.  No argument here.  I really don't understand what you are arguing at this point.  Your claim that he "knew he was doing something wrong", which I think is not supported.  I get it, he's is your hero  I haven't said that.   Try /r/askscience or https://physics.stackexchange.com/  https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/128680/the-alcubierre-drive-and-closed-timelike-curves    There's also the fact that the guy was caught lying about other things, like his grant funding and receiving different teaching award, on his vita.  from OP   I also take full responsibility and apologize for misrepresenting survey incentives and funding in LaCour and Green (2014).  In fact, I received a grant offer from the Williams Institute, but never accepted the funds,the LA GLBT received funding from the Evelyn and Walter Haas Jr.  Fund., and the Ford Foundation grant did not exist.   But how do you prevent abuse? Can I convince the server that road X has 1000 cars on it if I want to keep people away, for example?   I read that Google's car speeds if the cars around it do becaus it's safer.   If you didn't see the measurement, it hasn't collapsed/decohered relative to you. So you can still affect it.   How do you go from "he knew and participated in illegal activity" to "he knew he was doing something wrong"?  Many people don't identify morality with law, maybe Ross is one of them.   Ross opened a market with very few restrictions on what could be sold. He's said many times that he did this for philosophical reasons.  You claimed that he must have thought it was wrong, but haven't explained why.  Many people have defended him and think he did nothing wrong; why is it impossible that he also thought so?   His lawyer claimed in sentencing that it may have been role-play, because apparently people don't always mean things they say online.  Also, one of the six hits was faked by the corrupt agents.   Yeah but why would J be friends with him in the first place before making sure he wasn't a purple?   of is minor and left uncapped   How do you know what will happen when it goes under -2.0 and no clicks are received if that hasn't happened yet?   But for filthy pressers like you.   Will never press.  Anyway the button is rigged.   *bot too far   So why hasn't that been appealed back to the Supreme Court again?   It's called reddit, and there's a sub at /r/nocontext for listing all successes.   Well they claim he didn't write any code, all we need is for him to release a single line.   Apparently they aren't told that the other family is also judging them, according to the article.   That "exploit" was for poorly made apps that didn't verify receipts. Locking down content already on a user's device is not such a great idea anyway.  MITMs with user consent are not a security problem, except insofar as users are stupid.   Huge impact upwards, yes. If Apple loses money in the market by dumping for less than the buy price, that money goes to the other people in the market and supports a higher price.   You said he must have thought it was wrong, but why couldn't he have thought free markets are right?   That's an issue with the law, not the trial.   You can't destroy a market without holding coins, at least not directly. Buying then selling has little effect. Shorting could have a greater effect, but only insofar as Apple has the ability to short, and there are probably limits.  Declaring debate over is a very bad sign.   That was the same complaint parent had rephrased. Many hodlers wouldn't sell except at exorbitant prices, I don't know how many coins are like that, but I'd expect a significant amount of coins to go unsold if Apple stepped in.   Maybe that's because they didn't have much of a case. There were also a bunch of tactical mistakes made by the defense.  Do you think all trials with guilty verdicts are shams?   They couldn't get all (some have been burned, Satoshi's, etc), but likely can get an 80% majority if they were willing to use all their money on it.   You seem to think somebody can't actually believe in free markets enough to break the law, why is that? I'm not following your logic here.   What parts of the trial were shammy?   When was a plea offered?   It wasn't always clear, tobacco companies lied for years about it. There's a reason they paid billions to lawsuits.   Yeah but hype   That's irrelevant to my view, which is strictly consequentialist and therefore doesn't care about blame.   I think some jail time is warranted, but not anywhere close to what he got. If it was up to me, probably 2-3 years. In an ideal world, we wouldn't have jails, and these questions would be irrelevant.   Someone gets it.   I don't. Asserting that I do doesn't make it true.   Get a couple in your basement and rotate  /s   Yet it isn't one of the drugs that are illegal. (Well, except to some underprivileged members of society).   I'm pedantic, what can I do?   How are you deriving my moral beliefs from factual statements I've said, in violation of the is-ought problem?   Why is smoking cigarettes legal and not marijuana?  You could look up the debates that occurred when the laws were written if you want to find out.    Never once has a tobacco company executive gone to jail.  http://www.journalnow.com/news/local/update-phelps-gets-years-in-prison-ordered-to-pay-million/article_828ef774-b3b2-11e3-989b-001a4bcf6878.html   But smoking isn't illegal, drugs are.    yet nothing's being done about it  Source?   Yeah but one article might have info others don't.   I looked at the context, and referenced it above.  He's clearly talking about a one-time increase, if you look at the code at the beginning of the thread. There's absolutely nothing that implies multiple increases, as you claimed above, and have not shown.          The point is that "auto increases over time" is equivalent to what Satoshi meant by "phase it in."  Both of which refer to making the change non-abrupt -- with ample warning, ample lead time, etc.  No. Auto increases mean that no hard forks would be necessary in the future, the block size would increase whenever it's needed. What Satoshi wrote was just a single one-time increase.   The part you claimed above to be from Satoshi was the "auto increases over time", which wasn't in that post.      http://sourceforge.net/p/bitcoin/mailman/message/34090559/   Use virwox.com   No. First of all, the 20MB blocks would only be valid on top of all the blocks from now to the fork date.  You'd need 50% to do this.   Phased in, in context, means that clients that upgrade aren't immediately incompatible with older clients until a specific point is reached.  In other words, don't switch to bigger blocks until a delay.   Huh? Satoshi's proposal was just increasing to a new hard limit.   Tell me it's not your constimotherfuckatutional right to keep your mouth shut without having to worry about that silence being used as legal evidence of your guilt.  I didn't actually make any claims about rights, but here you go:  http://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/politics/supreme-court-pre-miranda-silence-can-be-used-as-evidence-of-guilt/  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jenkins_v._Anderson  http://thinkprogress.org/justice/2014/08/19/3472743/you-have-the-right-to-remain-silent-warning-does-not-apply-in-california/  http://definitions.uslegal.com/i/implied-admission/  Tell me cops/FBI aren't sometimes untrustworthy, crooked, and famously fraternal, that media doesn't get it wrong like when they posted a front page picture of a high school athlete and his track coach under a screaming headline labeling them the Boston bombers.  Nothing I've said implies that the media don't get things wrong; I feel strongly the opposite of that view.  Give me a reason why lawyers, judges, cops themselves, constitutional rights organizations, and your mom last night say the smartest, safest action to take when you're in trouble with cops is never talk to cops.  There are several reasons, but this is irrelevant; the silence here was in an interview to the media, not to the police.  I don't hate cops (for reference, I full on hate you), but I won't put my trust in them to act in my interest.  If you're going around hating random people on the internet for disagreeing with you, you might have some problems.  You can't be this dumb, this naive.  The statements you're implicitly attributing to me are not my opinion. You've used several strawmen in this discussion, which tells me you don't have a clear understanding of the situation here, or are deliberately misleading to make points.   P.S. you can upvote somebody without exclaiming it to the world like an idiot.  Upvoted.   That's why you don't argue over definitions.   /r/nocontext         Harry *is* his worst enemy, in the literal sense as well.

Proof by contradiction: assume that not everyone who agrees with this is wrong. That means that someone must agree with this and not be wrong, because logic. But since someone both agrees with this and is right, this must be right, which contradicts our premise that this is wrong. However, since everyone who agree is wrong, but the statement is correct, therefore nobody can agree to this true statement.

 Yes, I have become self aware.   Perhaps yeah. I'm going to estimate 1993 - 1994.   I feel this has become a very hilarious game of "Guess Who?", good fun old chap.   I need an adult.   Low attention span I believe.    Wat.   Go fish.   I know the type you're talking about, I think everyone in the industry will meet a few quantity over quality people during their aviation travels. Which of course is very unfortunate. Hope it all works out for you.    I'd love to order a print of this. I feel like this is the second time I wrote this comment to this picture in this sub. Dj vu. Anyone know the original photographer?   Very cool.   Thank you, and I hope you get to fly one as well. Good luck.   That's very interesting. Did you work on the original Twin Otters by any chance?   When and why did you make the switch?   Will do, thanks for the support!   A wise mechanic once put skydiving in perspective for me, "Why would you jump out of a perfectly good airplane? Even if this thing is on fire, let's ride it out a little and see where it goes."   Yes it is, the Calgary division.   I've never been on one, but I hear they're awesome.   Ha! No I am not, I assure you I am in the picture but wish to remain anonymous. I've never posted my face to reddit before, so I imagine this will be the closest I will get.       I used to have a large array of handles, but my main one was "Iceman". Thought I'd see if there are anymore of you out there.   Done and done, thank you!   Goddamnit I love Tina. She has to be one of the best characters on animated television. I feel star struck on the Internet now, thanks.  I just want to say thank you so much for the entertainment and please keep doing what you're doing, Bob's Burgers is awesome. How can I get an autograph from Tina?     NOoooooooooooOOOoooOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!      Unfortunately I cannot shed light on the quality, as I've only just begun collecting my favourite albums on vinyl and have not yet invested in a setup. This of course is something I want to do right and make sure I am financially prepared so it'll be a ways away. All I can tell you is Diamond Eyes is on white vinyl and that it was indeed the 85 dollar bundle (95 Canadian for myself).  EDIT: I believe they are all 180 gram.      [The article](http://wtop.com/256/3574525/Texting-walking-more-risky-than-distracted-driving)      This will definitely garner downvotes but ever since I've watched the True Detective series, looking back on Dexter is like trying to remember the plot of an Archie comic.   Cool shots, thanks for sharing. Didn't see any of Pino. Did he not tour this leg? I really love his style, was hoping he would be a permenant any member.   I too, choose to believe this happened. Amazing.      Interesting.    Thanks man, I've been waiting for this bundle to pop up again. Just placed my order.      Nice try officer.  EDIT: Minus Police.   I received "Closing Time" as a Christmas present one year. As a result whenever I listen to it I'm reminded of early evenings with wine and cigarettes in the snow.  EDIT: Redundancy.   I've always wanted to find the time to make a compilation of every time Scully's eye twitches. This is also good, thanks!   [Jacob's Ladder.](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0099871/)  EDIT: I should add this is one of my all time favourite movies, not just as a horror either. It's from 1990, but holds up really well IMO.       Yeah I hear you. I'm looking forward to it.   Grand is an excellent description.   Stinkfist.   My favourite single.   Spookiest. Grittiest. Most surreal.   I think [HR Giger](http://www.hrgiger.com) would also be a phenomenal choice.   I'd love to see it happen, although yes I know it's highly unlikely.  That's what I meant by that statement, I probably should have been more descriptive.   Definitely not against this idea.   I'm a fan of Alex Grey's work, don't get me wrong, but I just really love Aenima's style the most. I'd love to see it happen, although yes I know it's highly unlikely. Thoughts?   Me too, it's quickly moving up the ladder of my favourite APC tracks.    I start my work day every morning at 6AM with this song and a cup of joe. Actually makes it bearable.   I just wanted to say that I think the live version of "when the levee breaks" on Stone   Echo is goddamn fucking amazing.  That is all.   On the link you posted.   Ah, no I haven't. Thanks for the heads up.   CTRL+F a few key words I wrote with no results. Will it be updated?   It's Wednesday.   I would frame this if I knew where to get it.   Hey thanks for that. I'm prepared for the massive crowd and long line ups, at least I think I am. Either way, getting my evil dead poster signed is more important to me than actually meeting him. I guess I'll just have to wait and see.   Yeah it can be very tiring carrying a 30 pound kid everywhere. Especially for my poor pregnant wife at 7 months when I'm not around, essentially carrying two kids every time she has to leave the house.    I am strictly speaking from a Canadian stand point, I usually have the opposite problem as yourself, this is of course assuming you're American.   Thanks.   Hey thanks for the info. I'll look into it.   Nope, I'm talking Calgary. But I'm sure it's the kind of tour or setup.    Not sure if this is the appropriate sub for this or not, but the one and only Bruce Campbell will be at this years comic con and I'm a huge evil dead fan. This was enough to spark my interest and get me really excited about attending this year. Now I should add that I've never attended one of these before so please forgive my noobishness.   I'd really like to know what Bruce is like for those of you whom have met him, I am not really the nervous type but have a feeling he'll set me back a step. More importantly what's the etiquette for getting stuff signed? Can you bring more than one item if any at all? Or do they make you purchase while inside?  I think that about sums it up, it's going to be really cool to meet a guy like Bruce, even if it is only for a minute. Thanks in advance dreddit. Again sorry if wrong sub.     Dude, I've had a girl tell me this exact same thing, then even go as far as naming the baby girl after my Mother. I didn't think I could afford a paternity test at the time, and thought it wasn't worth it because you know, she named her after my mom and all. My brother who was much more established than I was at the time insisted on paying for the test, lo and behold the baby wasn't mine. I was surprised at first even though it was only a one night stand deal that turned into a few more times afterwards, but apparently this chick was going through a really bad break up and this was her way of coping, obviously not filling me in on the details.  Either way, I didn't mean to bore you with the details seeing how you are probably in a much different situation, but goddammit, that paternity test changed my life. Please do yourself the favor before doing anything else.  That was 11 years ago and I am currently happily married with an 18 month old boy, and a girl on the way. I'm really not sure if any of that would have come to fruition had I taken her word for it. Speaking of which, I should call my brother, what an awesome guy.  EDIT: Grammar.   EDIT: Spelling.   My son is about to turn 18 months next week and he still doesn't walk. He did however start the spider walk yesterday (feet flat on the floor, legs straight, and moving forward with his hands) so I'm hoping that's a good sign. I was having this same question/thought plague my mind the other day, and I keep asking myself if I am doing anything wrong.   On that note, it sounds like your son is doing fine, the whole army crawling thing is just another variation of crawling I believe, I watched a niece of mine develop the same way and she turned out to be a very smart and sweet little girl (age 7 now). I remember thinking it was peculiar, but it was just another developmental step before she was up and running. Otherwise everything else sounds right on par. Enjoy it while you can, babies are so sweet, I will miss these days I just know it.   Interesting. Tis a shitty situation she put you guys in, hopefully she'll cool off enough so you can track her down.   I do not personally know or have I communicated with your sister, however I would probably start with her account history, to see if any of the information she's posted in the last while makes any sense to you or the rest of your family. Good luck.   Pretty sure this is as high res as it gets.  [http://www.reddit.com/r/wallpapers/comments/1wqbdl/map_of_the_internet/cf4hklo](http://www.reddit.com/r/wallpapers/comments/1wqbdl/map_of_the_internet/cf4hklo)   Yeah, USPS is a pile of horse shit.   Would it be possible for you to transfer those to imgur? The Facebooks are blocked at my work place, and I am a very impatient person. If not no worries, thanks.            Nice thanks OP!   This is what I do when I laugh on the internet ---- "hahahaha". I'm never sure if it comes off as sincere or not.   Surely op will deliver.   I too am having this problem. What the hell?         Totally what I meant to say.   Quoting ~~hooker with a penis~~ aenima in a tattoo thread on /r/toolband.  EDIT: Brain fart.   PLEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEASE!!!!!!!!!!!!!   May I too have the recipe when you wake up, these look amazing. Thank you.      I know, tool putting their twist on that song would fucking intense.   [Echoes](http://youtu.be/uJtw7SP0oN4)   Congratulations man, that's huge news!    Thank you very much, I hope my little angel will be as observant as yours!   I've also heard of this method, but am very reluctant to use it. Although it may be effective, I don't want my child to associate me with physical pain.   I try asking him what's wrong, but he doesn't really have a grasp of the English language yet, only uses a few words. But I make sure to talk to him as much as I can, pointing and naming everything in sight. I'm hoping for that language explosion any day now.   As for stomping feet he still doesn't walk, however when he gets frustrated with his toys for whatever reason he will let out a squeal and throw a small tantrum until one of us can help him out.   We more or less do this now, I guess persistence is the name of the game. Thanks!   I have no idea honestly, it seems to be some sort of play fighting. I know his intent is fairly harmless, but it needs to stop either way. He is a really active child, we have a hard time keeping up with him, he has no interest in television and loves to drive his cars around on the floor and dance to music, I doubt it's an surplus of energy. I'm hoping it's some sort of phase that will dissipate as he develops his sense of empathy.   This sounds like a much better process than my current voice raising. It breaks my heart because he pouts when I tell him what he's doing wrong. I know he doesn't know any better and that he may even have a hard time understanding me, and that this is method I use probably isn't going to be effective in the long term.   Thanks so much for your thoughtful reply, I will definitely try it out.   Hello /r/parenting, I'm so glad I found you this past week. I can tell I have much to learn from you guys and I look forward to growing with you. Having said that, I am new to fatherhood with my 17 month old son, and his soon to be born baby sister. So far I am having a blast, with all the ups and downs, all I know is I wouldn't change it for the world and that this has been the best experience of my life so far.  The reason I come to you guys with this post is that currently my son has started to hit really hard, he has always had a thing for pulling my wife's hair, but now he's doing both to us. I really don't know how to react when he does this, should I be firm and tell him no? Or should we try not to draw any attention to it. So far I've been doing my best to make him understand that it hurts and that he shouldn't do it, but it's seemingly having no effect.  I'd really like to know how to deal with this especially before our little girl enters the situation and becomes another victim. Thank you so much for any help you can offer.    There's always a way, I have seen Jurassic Park 34+ times.   Yeah, I'd say when the day comes I require its services, it'll be all fixed up.   J'ai mang une motoneige avec des poissons?   Wow, what is this world coming to?   Probably not an intended media server, but a little go get'em attitude can fix that. PS3 wasn't an intended media server either, but it's probably my favourite one I've ever owned up to this point.   Fucking halo made me get the Xbone, even though it isn't even out yet. Regardless, when my PS3 dies as my current media server, and the price is right, I'll replace it with the PS4.  The fact that they are both lack backwards compatibility really irks me all the same, Street Fighter Alpha 3 for the PS is one of my all time favorite games, so if my PS3 ever does bite the dust I don't know what I'll do.  EDIT: I called every future shop/wal mart/best buy/visions ect ect. in the city when I tried to purchase the Xbone and there was zero availability if that means anything.   TIL the PS4 is way better than the Xbone.   I had the same problem with the xbone, so I ordered it from future shop's website with free shipping. Showed up at my door in 1.5 days VIA Canada post. Not sure if it would be similar for the PS4, but it's worth a shot.   Ahh yeah, you're right, it totally is a mirror. Very similar to the [inspection mirror](http://imgur.com/tiaPDfj.jpg) I use at work.   Excess string spooled up?   I had the same thing with the DVD, waited about a week and a bit, then got the shipment confirmation email the other day. So they will replenish their stock.      I love this thing striss, great work!  EDIT: Can we secure an area while we're working on it? Probably put a timer on there so if one forgets it'll automatically reset and be available to the public once again. I was drawing a flag, came back in an hour and someone had it messed up, now I'm pouting and don't want to continue.   Although his/her answer was thorough and awesome, s/he did allude to Calgary being more of a white collar town, which is really not the case. Maybe on the surface it would appear that way, but there are many trades for one to get into. Even with only a high school diploma, you could definitely get your foot in the door as a pipe fitter and make a great living in a few years. Do you know people in either town or surrounding areas? That would be the biggest deciding factor for me.   Good old Sook Yin, I used to have a huge crush on her growing up. I seriously miss the 90's MuchMusic format, back when the programming actually covered music, and music related subjects. Yes, we live in a different era and they have to pander to what sells, I'm just disappointed. Please don't link me to the MTV guy ranting to people like me.  I thought she did a decent job with the interview, maybe a tad nervous, but that probably comes from being a big fan. I thought Maynard handled the tool related questions just fine, he more or less finger pointed towards the other guys at the end there, but that's nothing new.  EDIT: [She's still looking cute as ever](http://m.imdb.com/name/nm0498271/)   [http://vimeo.com/m/6262622](http://vimeo.com/m/6262622)   I had a small click of friends that slowly expanded throughout high school, some of my expansion pack friends were more popular and went to parties with people who I generally didn't associate with (jocks and preps I believe were the terms we used back then). I recall going to one of these parties (somewhere around 1998), where the booze kicked in and I had the balls to stop the music that was currently playing, whatever it was I remember it being terrible. Either way I remember dropping on aenima that I had brought (I never left the house without 15-20 cd's and a discman in my backpack). I was expecting contorted faces of disgust and hatred, however stinkfist kicked in and everyone seemed to mesh to it, and it was awesome. Then I thought to myself, ok, this will all change when Die Eier Von Satan comes on. Waited patiently for that industrial German racket to begin with my troll face in gear. Again, a room full of people from all clicks just had the best time, it was the first time I think I realized that maybe it was me who was the asshole and not everyone else. It's like I shed a layer of hatred that night.  I have no idea why I just replied to your message with this.  EDIT: Grammar/additional info.   I have to agree with you. This video was on the front page yesterday after all. I'd say it's probably OP.   Hey thanks a lot, I'll look into it. My only concern is waiting right now, I like the idea of not having to order from amazon. But it's good to have options. Thanks again for the info.   Can you make any recommendations?   I'm looking to upgrade my desktop computer sound system, was wondering if any of you fine people have any experience with the [Harman Kardon Soundsticks III](http://www.memoryexpress.com/Products/MX44014)?   Thank you kind internet person.   Thank you very much!      I've never seen it. I guess I should check it out?  EDIT: "You" = "I".   Thanks. I also love the song "Rosie" by Tom Waits, and then of course there's Interpol and their song "Evil". I thought to myself, this name is mentioned way too many times in songs I love.   Thank you.   I am a little bit of a collector, however I don't mind sampling most things from the internet, but when it comes to music I feel the urge to physically own it. Maybe I'll take your advice until I can find a copy!   I hadn't taken part in this poll, but am very surprised to see "Rosemary" so high up in the rankings. I also love this song, and have talked to my wife and we have agreed to use "Rosemary" as the name for my daughter to be. Glad people love it as much as I do.   Will do thanks. I ended up ordering it off amazon but they were out of stock so I have to wait for them to get more. In the meantime I'll try music stores around the city.   It was definitely worth it. Also, the live DVD is amazing.      Is there anywhere else to purchase this item other than [puscifer.com](http://www.puscifer.com)? The $30 shipping charge is astronomical, and I haven't found another place to buy it yet. Any info would be awesome, thanks.   I just had one at [Oasis](http://www.experienceoasis.ca/index.php) yesterday, they do fine work. No membership required.   Awesome.   Haha I am not surprised.  	129
 I think I'm with you on that. But who am I to say for sure? Basically what I'm getting at is that the smartest human alive knows essentially nothing in regards to existence and the universe.    Therapy, Frank. Seek it.    I think someone jizzed in his Farina.    I think it all depends on what "version" of God you are thinking about. I don't buy into any of the organized religions, and recognize too many inconsistencies and oxymorons in their teachings. With that being said, I cannot confirm or deny that some form of ultimate creator does or doesn't exist. If some sort of grand architect were to exist, I don't know the specific abilities he may or may not possess.   Furthermore *what if* **our** creator didn't create the universe entirely? Being that he created us, would he still be considered our God? Or is that term expressly used to describe the finite ultimate intelligence that created everything in existance as we know it?  Where did God come from? Who created it? What existed before God? What is God?    So how many people have been killed over the past ~10 years by not globally transitioning from a fossil fuel reliance into fully funded and widespread use of renewable, clean, and alternative energies?   True, good points. Any specific reason why you chose to go with a wooden spoon as opposed to just a spoon in general?   Well, I mean, *if* God exists, you technically put *yourself* in Hell by not having faith in him during your life and following his teachings to the letter. Maybe it's not so much actually "sending" you to Hell as it is saying you aren't allowed into his Heaven (he has the right to choose, it's his, he created it) because you didn't obey his wishes, and the only alternative to Heaven is a dimension controlled by Satan (Hell).   (I'm not religious)   I don't get the Writing Prompts hate. This is incredibly original and well written. As someone who appreciates great writing and recognizes the difficulty behind it, I don't give two shits if WP posts tend to appear more frequently in /r/bestof than those of other subs. It has a [WritingPrompts] tag so you don't have to be inconvenienced by clicking the link if you don't give a shit about WP posts. The fact that it's being upvoted in /r/bestof means that most people appreciate the content.    It's a wooden spoon. In the fiery pits of hell. Sounds like that spoon isn't going to last very long.   Give me the fucking vacation, and while I'm there, I'll shmooze God into letting me stay.   In that case, you must be hungry. Hit up Jims Steaks @ 4th and South.   Wiz wit, lettuce, mayo, salt   pepper. Do it.  Edit: BTW, you may get a better response rate over at /r/philadelphia. Not many people subscribe to this sub.   Civil war! Nice!  Edit: And probably pretty valuable.   But first, to the hospital!   It was a murder weapon.   No biggie. High noon and low noon.    Don't be so hard on yourself, man. You seem like a good, introspective dude to me.   Not really, because smoking weed changes your metabolic rate and subsequent digestion process. When you smoke for a long time, you develop a consistent pattern in that process. When you stop smoking, your body is essentially just correcting back to normal.    That's not a withdrawl symptom, its just an adjustment to your bodys metabolic rate and subsequent digestion schedule.   Heroin kills, bro.   This is the honest truth when it comes to marijuana addiction. It's no more addicting than the skittles that I can't seem to stop eating.    You are me. Except I'm 29, manage a restaurant, and make like 1/7th of your salary.  You lucky son of a bitch.   You Goddamn genius. Brb, going to buy some panty hoes.   Get. Out.

LOUD NOISES   I think technically, if you read the article, they are trying to say that fracking *has not caused widespread damage to the US water supply, and does not pose a threat to do so in the future*. They are saying there have only been a small number of localized contamination issues around certain drill sites.   Personally I think it is all complete bullshit (politics/money), and there is no doubt that fracking causes major groundwater contamination. There is no reason to believe that this contamination and these chemicals being pumped into the ground will not eventually make their way into larger water sources.   Simply put; The EPA is bought and sold. This conclusion and article title are both bullshit. This report cannot be trusted and you should probably actually assume the direct opposite of what it's telling you.    He said a 'model' of his death beam. It was a 'model' of his death beam. It would not have to be functioning, as a model car would not be functioning.  Tesla, you sly fox.   That was beautiful, man. Truly beautiful.    Yea. We're fucked. The title of this article basically means, "Fracking definitely fucks up your drinking water."   PayPal is a terrible company. I urge anyone reading this to skip their bullshit altogether and use a viable alternative.   "Water isn't wet" - EPA   As they kick in your neighbors door.   "DROP THE WEED HIPPIE!"  "I don't even smoke officer..."  "STOP RESISTING!!!"      Ohh shiit [7]. When I read the title, I legitimately thought it was strange, and I was briefly inspired with a tiny bit of hope for my country.   "The US Navy stopped shelling something because it didn't want to hurt some whales? Well that doesn't sound right, but I'm with it!"  Oh what a naive fool I have been.    It depends... are you black or hispanic?    but perhaps shows that the system is flawed on many, many levels.  THIS is the root of all of our problems.    Maybe the military needs to train all of our police? Perhaps you can help them drop their nuts while they learn a few things.    probably from the last couple years only   My ex and her douche bag fiance are both HS teachers.

I think there is potential for treatment regarding those diseases, among many many others. On the reveres side, some people say that long term exposure to weed tends to increase the likelihood of developing illnesses such as anxiety and schizophrenia, among other types of psychosis. I think a lot of it is based on genetics. Furthermore, i think there needs to be exponentially more unbiased and regulated studies into the potential medicinal and psychological benefits of marijuana as well as those regarding the potential long term detrimental side-effects.   I have a personal belief that marijuana has tremendous medicinal and psychological potential. But big pharma can't exactly profit off of a plant that anybody can grow in their basement, which is probably 50+% the reason why it remains illegal.    Read the title and noped out before the video even loaded.   10/10 will save this gif for later use   Stretch Armstrong, you sneaky son of a bitch.    Precisely...    I mean c'mon, guys. It's not like he Roethlisberger'd a chick in a public bathroom.    Bro, i think you might be on to something. [7]   Ghost in the Shell   Not only that, they landed a probe and took soil samples.    Someone is PISSED.  Left the dildos on the roof of the car again.   I would love to.    Hey man, IDK if I can help or not, but I consider myself to be a day sleeper by nature. I just prefer to be awake at night but I can adapt myself to either cycle.   When sleeping during the day, the most important thing is covering your eyes or eliminating the light source to the room. I will put a headband around my eyes, or the sleeve of a sweatshirt, or a pillow, whatever it takes to block out the light. Also if possible try to get some good shades on the windows.  Next step is, obviously, you have to be tired. To accomplish this, try and pull an all-nighter so that you've been awake for 24 hours. You will notice that you will sort of get a second wind for night 2 and when it comes time for you to sleep, you'll be tired enough to make it happen.  Then it's all about holding that schedule and after a little bit, your body's clock will sync up to compensate.    Because of the specific capabilities of their data capturing programs, they can and will essentially monitor EVERYTHING all at once. Don't think of it as individual NSA employees wasting their time monitoring a forum, think of it as a massive data center that basically captures ALL information as it passes through whatever wires/communication hub they are tapping.   They can then use an algorithm to scan for certain keywords (could be a short list or a very long list) that they deem "ideologically dangerous" or "a threat to national security". All of those instances that the computer algorithm red flags can THEN be investigated by a person in greater detail. They know everything about you. Your patterns, your habits, where you go every day of your life, who you interact with, the foods you eat, the products you buy. You can easily be profiled based on your bank card spending/location data, phone content/location data, and internet browsing habits alone.  Your life history (and basically everyone elses) is on file for future reference.   Like it or not, if you say certain words or phrases over the phone/internet, or express a pattern of certain behavior that they don't like, you will be on one of their lists.    Probably true. Would there be any shrapnel from the initial explosion?   Dafuq is happening to this country?   Naive, you are. Educate yourself, you must.

Now the TSA is going to start "screening" the lines at football stadiums!   Got a problem? Nothin' that can't be solved with mo' asshole checks.    And the TSA didn't take mankind to another celestial body.   Daddy, NO!   Next up...  *Breaking News, Read All About It:*  **Top 5 U.S. Bottled Water Producers Have Been Donating Hundreds Of Millions To The TSA In Latest Confiscation For Profit Scandal.**   According to Cit 4, at time of production the number of people on various stages of their "lists" was about 1.2 million. Current US population is prob about 325 million.   It would be easy to say that given the time that has passed since the doc was filmed, the watch-list could have grown to at least 3.25 million. So as a safe bet, at minimum, 1% of the population (1 in 100 people) are being actively monitored to some level or extent.     they really screwed him  Literally or figuratively?

 Ride one. Ride this one, then tell me how joyless it is! I was blown away.   Wait til ya ride one. I love me some dinosaur burners, but this was one of the most exciting things I've ridden in years.      Yeah but it's more like 'yes sweep til Brooklyn.'   Ctrl-F "stromile"  All is in order, thank you.   Haha bring it on! My brother and I did an hour long dick song show last year. It's a labour of love. Get her to link me done tunes!   Please show this to your daughter, I feel we may be kindred spirits. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-QtWWZiQzo   Reporting for duty, where do I queue?   Green skinned Aussie here, can confirm.    Thunder would appear to have the edge, but dare I say DeAndre Jordan might be a big factor? Dude is acting like a 7 foot Rodman lately.   What they need is a coach who can better utilize Howard and Lin in a pick and roll offense. I hear D'Antoni is available.   Oh, I dunno, because he was playing like a sack of shit all series?   Not to mention, KD had been shooting like absolute faeces for the entire game, missing just about everything.   I gotta say it, Durant has looked like a piece of shit in this series.    That... That's actually pretty fantastic.   I choose not to be dragged down by the cynicism of this video. Instead I shall marvel at the gorgeous camerawork and sweet editing.   You smoke flavoured tobacco in those things for like 45 minutes at a time. I can't believe that wouldn't make a big difference to your energy levels in an overtime game.   /r/asmr ;)   I think it's more likely to go fungal, but we'll see!   Fair call. Unfortunately lyrics and melody are very tired together for me. Maybe this is just my dick period.    http://m.soundcloud.com/wrongtown-brothers/one-little-person ;)   I'm amazed I got the "honeymooner's choice" line past my editor in the Multistrada one... :P   Close - just north of Melbourne, Australia.   Not the missus, but one of her friends. I've banned the missus from getting on the back, she fell asleep in the twisties a couple of times and my ego couldn't take it. :P   She's fine. But yeah, I don't think she's real keen to get back on again. She had no idea when it happened, but when she saw the tape, she nearly crapped herself.   Cheers mate! We're going to get back into them in the next few months. :)   Aye, it looks tight as a motherfucker. Is that how the drag guys run them?   They made some absolutely shithouse chemistry moves when they dealt Granger and picked up Turner and Bynum. Heart and soul got replaced by a pair of me-first bastards.   Dwight and Lopez look weirdly uncoordinated on offense. Dwight's hook looks so stiff and strange.    *dominant   There's been a few similar threads on Reddit with people admitting they've got the attraction and are trying like hell never to act on it. What a tough hand to be dealt.   He also works his arse off, to be fair.    Ya mean white balance?   I feel like there's an equivalent Austin Powers gif just waiting to get made.   There were sure some amazing characters back then. Gods like Jordan, villains like Laimbeer, and a complete alien like Rodman the likes of which we won't see again.    Well, they still dribble up and down the court, so I'd like to see that included.   What a great video!   I dunno, he seems like a nice guy, but a total clown. A lot like Dwight Howard in that regard.    Wishful thinking I reckon. Consistency ain't his game.    Those things are pure horn in the metal.   That is some serious skill. Not a great bike for doing stoppies on, and he's just owning it!   Refurbished macbook pro?       Greatest that ever lived.   Durant looked very ordinary out there for most of that game. Almost seemed like he was pushing to get to his 25 points.   That's the problem here - the Spurs have a better chance of beating the Heat. Just let 'em through already.   I've taken pairs of tyres to the shop like that. Gotta plan ahead a bit in traffic! A mate then asked how to move a tyre I was giving him, and I told him to put his arms up and slip it over his head. Had him stuck like that for about 5 minutes while I rolled around laughing. Pro tip: stand in the tyre and pull it up around your waist!   As an Aussie, it's absolutely worthy of comment. Any sports stars over here that behaved like that would be treated with the kind of scorn Americans seem to reserve for Justin Bieber.   Metta's Champions thing was alright. Is he "active?" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjEUAtEisc4   Or are they just really missing Granger?   I'd agree with this. If you've got the time and skills to grade all your footage, then go ahead and shoot cinestyle. But it adds time to the process, and unless you know what you're doing, it actually makes the footage look worse than standard. I've gone back to shooting a lot of my stuff on standard because clients can't tell the difference and it's heaps quicker.   Well will ya look at that date!   It's the ring of faeeeeeceeeees...   I had a hornet 919 years ago, ripping bike, loved it. Might even prefer it to the FZS1000 at the end of the day! But ya gotta run what ya brung as they say!    Yep, the 2002. Need to keep it revving like mad to keep up with the big twins I'm chasing! Could do with some bottom end.       They absolutely fucked that piece of road up.    I dunno... Show me the data.    Barkley was an energy-filled hate machine of intimidation. He went hard as a motherfucker with full intensity on every play.   Bought it. Watched it. It's got a few moments but it's not awesome.    Dear god.   Can you say that five times fast?    My theory is that people see crystal clear photos and don't have the emotional response that they get from old photos. A lot of stylistic processing emulates the problems inherent in shit cameras, old film or old photos and that resonates with people's desire to reminisce. It gives the photos a kind of aged credibility. It's odd.    That's the "Chuck a Wheelie" signal.    WHOSE GAME IS IT? IT'S MICHAEL JORDAN'S GAME!    WITHOUT THE BASKETBAAAAALLLLL   Nigga on, if that's what gets you through the day.   Be... cause I didn't see that?  :P      Here, I knocked this up. Hope it helps! http://www.gizmag.com/remove-chromatic-aberration-color-fringing-lightroom-5/31174/   OK I'll put something together.   Honestly the bars and big eyes make it look a bit like a sad elephant. But I bet it's nicer to ride already.    Let's not forget, whichever porn star he chooses to rail will be made well aware that he's the slut shaming asshole that outed one of their colleagues. It will not go well for him.    YOU FOOL. YOU WILL KILL THIS SUBREDDIT WITH TALK LIKE THAT!    It's incredibly easy, super intuitive and extremely fast - even faster when you're dealing with a stack of shots. There's still things that PS is handy for, but LR absolutely shits on it for file handling, choosing your keepers, getting a basic look, doing your crops, etc etc etc.   And the league and the ticket buying public can't be sure one team or the other's just not going to bring half their squad. Pop reaps what he sows.   On my mobile right now but it's pretty intuitive. It's under lens corrections/color.    The primes give the best looking photos, but I can't get by without my 24-105. I probably take 90% of my shots with it.   It's a brilliant lens but pretty limited in scope. Probably makes my favourite images, but I'm not gonna take it out on a walk around!   Lightroom kills CA very effectively, you can spend a little tie and make absolutely sure you've got rid of it on your keepers.   Mine too. It flies.    Appreciated! (I think I've fucked it) :)   I've always thought he was a straight up knob.   Why's that?    Symptoms are as follows: Lens seems to work normally at 24mm, but as you zoom in, the IS and aperture start to jump around wildly. I believe this is an issue with the flexible communications ribbon that connects to the aperture control ring. Canon Australia wants $480 to repair it... That's ludicrous, especially given that you can get a whole new lens for $700 in some places.  I've found a second hand aperture ring with a new ribbon soldered on and I want to have a crack at making the repair, but I understand it's easy to knock certain lens elements out of alignment in the process. Has anyone opened one of these lenses up, and do you have any tips for me?   Old fixer upper motorcycle.   Mirror?   Anyone ever yells that at you, I got bad news for ya. Or good news, depending...   That was great!   What about "I'm... We're..." and "As if you'd ever take responsibility for something!"     Penis.   Wow. :)   Sweet baby jesus that was good.    Nice shot... I assume you've got in and cropped it as straight as you can, and fiddled with the distortion controls? If so, you might need to fire this one into Photoshop and play with the skew or perspective tools.   You guys woulda held on if it wasn't for the okc defense though. That 12-0 run had a stack of forced turnovers in it.    Just chuck it in and go! FCPX is awesome with DSLR video.    *dominant   HGGGGNNNNNNNGGGGGHHHHH  *spaff*  Two, please. One with a flat bar.   A vow of positivity... I should look into that, I'm a grumpy cunt.   I'd go a step further and name him as the greatest single sportsman of the modern era. Better and more transcendent than Rossi, Federer, Schumacher, Tiger, Beckham... Maybe there's an argument for Wayne Gretzky, but ice hockey is a much less global sport than basketball.   Stromile Swift over Tyrus Thomas: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfN0gF6MIRQ  Good god.   Funny how these things keep showing up around dunk contest time.   All this "I'm not doing the dunk contest, but look at me anyway" stuff is bullshit. Put up or shut up.   Yeah but it sort of fell flat.   I remember MJ saying something that really resonated with me - something along the lines that every night, there was some kid up in the stands who was only ever going to get one chance to see him play. He said he played every night for that kid, so he could never take a night off.   And yet look at who the heat lose to.   Similar to the way LeBron's regular season coasting will tarnish his legacy.   I can tell you I got the Canon 135 recently and it's an absolute ripper. Sharp, separates the background beautifully and focuses very fast. And half the price.    For sure, but if your auto focus system is losing you shots and getting you into trouble with clients...   Except... Most of those are deeply ordinary pictures, I see nothing that makes me want to give up my DSLR.    Yes, but he had that whole thing going where he sort of loped about at half pace, keeping up with everyone, and then exploded when he wanted to. Extraordinary motor.   Fucking hell, it feels like Stern had been on his last couple of days for about two years!    YEAH IT WAS ABOUT TIME SOMEBODY TOOK BENNETT DOWN A PEG.   It's a beast unless she shoots fast action stuff, in which case it's only awesome.   So much can happen though. KD could snap like a twig in a winning WCF game 7. You've got to be in it to win it, and the pathetic East more or less hands the ECF to Miami with only one decent team in the way.   	115

The fog might mean you want to up your carb and/calorie count a little. Play with that and see if it helps. As for getting your but kicked I'm right there with you. The way I look at it now is that I'm stronger/more endurance so I can lift heavier and longer which means I'm not taking as many breaks in the beginning..hence butt getting kicked   you may want to kill the pasta...especially late at night....various studies have shown that its best to get all your carbs in by lunch so that more fat is burnt over night.(also there will be no carbs for your body to turn to fat)   i found the best way to prepare for p90x is to put on some workout clothes, grab a bottle of water and a towel, and finally pop the dvd in   since i know the moves by heart i turn off the video and just start doing them at my pace.

Can you do more reps/higher weights. Since you didnt start out fat the changes are going to be harder to see so you really need to focus on the strength numbers. If you aren't improving there then THAT mean you aren't "bringing it"   I just bout the 90lb power blocks....but that a really good deal so i would go with it   gold level terran an occassional LoL player...would be willing. PM for character ID :)   If ALL you are looking for is losing weight I believe Insanity is your option. P90x focuses on lowering fat by increasing muscle. Also, 2 weeks is nothing! as a fellow ADD person i can tell you that you need to focus your thoughts elsewhere. If you do either completely you will get results. Also, p90x takes 90 days with most gains coming in the last 30 minutes and Insanity only takes 60   that sounds like a lot of carbs. Are you sticking to the 50% protein, 25% carbs, 25% fat macros suggested?   loseit.com   at the time i was in phase 1 i was 190 and depending on the protein bar/yogurt/sides/protein shake it would fluctuate. That being said I went back to my food logs and I was getting 170-235g a day   There should be a post in this thread showing my stats as far as working out..I played 2 hours of basketball a day in middle school/highschool. College I gained 50lb(135 to 190) and worked my butt to get back down to 175. I was back up to 200 before i started p90x...now at 180  EDIT: as for health wise...I'm a cardio monster bc of sports but lack(ed) upper  body strength    Breakfast for week: nonfat Yogurt + protein bar OR oatmeal with banana..on weekends i'll cook 5 eggwhites and have two pieces wheat toast  Lunch for week: salad with turkey/ham( i keep a supply of spinach leafs, tomatoes, carrots, and turkey/ham from the deli in my work fridge) with some super low fat dressing(i use a honey mustard dressing i found at my local walmart)  DINNER for the week:  Sunday: Cook a whole bunch of chicken breast(5). Eat one with some brocolli. Store rest in fridge. Monday: Take one chicken breast(precooked) and make a chicken chili with navy beans and garbanzo beans(this should leave a bunch of leftovers that you can eat on days you don't feel like cooking. Tuesday: One Chicken breast and saute with one bell pepper(like fajitas!) Sprinkle low fat cheese on top and serve with vegi of choice. Weds: Take one chicken breast, shred and mix with 1/4 cup bbq sauce(low sugar!). sprinkle with a little cheese. Place on top of wheat english muffins and bake for 10 minutes to make mini-chicken pizza's(2-3 english muffins cut in half should be fine) Thursday:Remember that chicken chili? leftover time Friday:cut remaining chicken breast in half. shred and serve on top of salad. Saturday: Finish chicken chili at lunch. Other half chicken used in dinner of choice  combine this with a post workout proteinshake/recovery drink and you should be hitting 1900 calories per day and keeping pretty close to the 50% p, 25% c, 25%f suggested by P90x. When I get tired of chicken I'll change it up by having salmon or turkey italian sausage or a turkey burger.      Info of interests:  * Day1: 0 normal pushups(had to do on knees), 0 normal pullups(couldn't do a negative either), 15 lb curl for 12 reps * Day 27: 20 High/low pushups(from core synergistics), 25 negative pullups, 25lb curl for 20 reps * day 56: 30 pushups, 5 REAL PULLUPS!!!!, 25lb curl for 20 reps      hmm...honestly it felt like most the weekend. But some times i feel the same way about tastosis or Day9. I think if i had to verbalize it i would say this felt like you casting for Playhem(which i'll mention is awesome).  i just expect a slightly more serious cast out of MLG than i would out of Playhem.  Once again, Just my personal opinion on that one. I really feel the next step for you is getting comfortable in front of that camera so that when you come on stage at a big MLG, you'll fit in.  ALSO, you'd better watch out for Tumba's fiance talking about him like that.    Hey robin,  I thought over all you did really well especially when compared to Beta stream last year. If i could give some advice it would be  * i didn't mind the camera work but it did seem off and/or too frequent. When you do a zoom/rotation there needs to be meaning behind it(aka getting a better view of the action) * you need to find a line in between joking caster robin and serious caster robin. I thought when you casted Korean qualifiers with JP you had it spot on...this weekend you seemed a little too "jokey"  but thats just my opinion * you need to become less aware of the camera when you have a cocaster. During the finals when Tumba asked you a question you would speak to the camera with an occasional glimpse to him...it really should be the other way   i'm in america and getting crazy amount of lag at 240p   I would suggest trying to get some more protein from natural sources instead of bars/shakes personally but it seems okay...honestly using a site like loseit.com to track the calories your intaking  and the  macros  would be best   also wanted to add that I did this by keeping 10ish almonds on my desk for when i get hungry..   Hey I'm also on week 7(yesterday being my yoga day) and I added around 200 calories to my diet and it made me feel a ton better. You know what? it may diminish my results but I don't care because this is about making a change I can live with for the rest of my life..if my results are a little slower but I feel better than I think its worth the trade off :)   Speaking from experience, you can't just go in with the mind set of looking better would be nice...you need to go in with the mind set that "90 days from now you ARE going to be in such chiseled shape that your body will be like a gods". I love to cook...guess what i did? I took the principles of the p90x diet(50% protein, 25% carbs, 25% fat) and logged my meals in loseit.com and I cooked meals i thought i would like that still fit into that plan(Last night i made a delicious honey glazed salmon).   i'm a gold level terran(and i'd like to think my zerg is silver level) and i'd be willing to help.  test_subject4671.465 I'm normally on after 7pm EST   when i get a case of the blahs i try to substitute one of my workouts for another less formal workout...this usually looks like me replacing kenpo by going to the gym and playing basketball. changes up the routine a little which i'm all for   I had been struggling to hit 1900 calories and even though p90x suggested 2400 i thought i was doing well. I uped m caloric intake by 200 for a week and saw weight loss....so i would try adding a couple hundred calories for a week and see what happens...at the worst you gain a(single) lb and find out that its not the issue.   I'm going to a concert tonight...hopefully my plyo jumping will come into full affect tonight. Really starting to kill pullups and this make me happy.   I have the Gold's gym 25. They work really well when dropping weight but can be a little tedious if you are going up a weight...they work for what i need and were cheap. My only complaint is there light weight as i'm now reaching the point where i need heavier weights   i just don't like playing tvt there...i mean i dont like tvt in general...but any map where you can seige up on a ledge and kill me and i cant stop it i try to downvote   yesterday was back and biceps...i upped the weight on almost every bicep workout by at least 5 lbs. I really struggle with form here..using my back to get weights up instead of isolating my biceps. Today starts the stretch of the week i dislike the most (yoga, into legs, into cardio day)   week 6 Day 4 today. starting the section that really kills me..my legs are still sore from Plyo and I have yoga today, leg/back tomorrow, and then Basketball(which i replaced kenpo with)I haven't weighed myself in a couple weeks but i think i'm down 2 lbs last i checked. Significant strength gains though.   i downvoted antiga bc of close spawns and taldarim(doesn't suit my play style)   you are going to run out of space if you link to every day for the rest of the program ;)    this seems like carb overload...i don't know how you could meet the 50%,25%,25% with that much carbs unless you had nothing else with carbs in it the rest of the day   yeah when i took my post 4 week pics i actually could tell a major difference despite the consistent weight. So i'm not complaining. Week 6 now and going strong   i'm jealous of your core. two years ago i was killing ab ripper x every other day....this year i still haven't hit every single rep   i think the thing i notice most is the better posture. Yoga + strengthening in the back probably have helped a lot with that. Good Job   I did chest/tri/shoulders today. Must admit i really didn't feel like doing the workout. I went to the rivalry basketball game at my alma mater and we lost a heart breaker...I really wanted to eat pizza and drink beer afterwards...instead i came home, did my workout, had a cup of chocolate milk, cooked some chicken tenders, and had the tenders with a protein shake(I WAS REALLY low on calories today)   I don't know if you saw my results when i posted them last week but that is exactly what i've been doing using the program(lose belly, gain muscle). I personally eat a 1900(plus or minus 200) calorie diet using the 50% protein, 25% carb, 25% fat principles of the fat shredder. I use loseit.com to track my nutrients   you must not play either of those two races bc if you did you would know that the statement you made above is just not true. Zerg has to constantly set up flanks to creat good engagements and still lose half the time. Stutterstep is anything but bronze level friendly especially when you need to macro at the same time.   Good because we need protoss to be more of a HERP DERP 1-A race...must remember the new snipe will now effect TvP late game which was already craptastical   I believe D is used for wide grip. E F are probably just used for casual pull ups? idk about those two   there is a lot of angst against people who are already in decent shape so thats probably why the downvotes on the main reddit. Good job on starting, keep it up! Also don't be afraid to go to your knees to get more reps  	79
 Thank you for these. Clockwork Yellow: You can see where this is going, obviously. One of the surprising things for many people is how many of these strategies we are using despite KNOWING they will make us feel worse. We don't INTEND to feel worse, so something else is going on. Anyway, I don't want to prejudice others who might reply. Other ideas, anyone?   I'm a psychologist and author (Your Depression Map) and would appreciate some help from any of you who might be interested.  Throughout our lives, much of our behaviour is designed with the ultimate goal of creating a positive emotional state - in effect, I want the better job, the cream cheese bagel, the Hawaiian holiday, even a sense of meaning in purpose BECAUSE I believe that if I get those things I will be happy/content/joyful/etc.  We spend our lives oriented in this one direction, and often seem to miss the target: we don't feel all that happy. Would we be any more accurate if we deliberately tried to be UNHAPPY instead? And what might we do if the agenda was to feel unhappy that we are already doing for some reason or another?  So here's the deal:    Imagine that 10 days from now you could win a large sum of money (in my groups, we make it $10 million - what the heck, it's imaginary) if you could make yourself more unhappy on that day than you are now.    The fine print: You can only do or change THREE things (maximum) in your mind or life. And you can't list anything that's not in your own power to do (no alien invasions, no global economic meltdowns). We give you 10 days, because maybe some of your strategies won't work right away and require some time to build up.  In return, I'll tabulate the answers and report back to this subreddit. (I've elaborated on this topic a bit more on my blog, but this post has all you need. The blog is at  http://www.psychologysalon.com/2013/04/what-if-you-wanted-to-be-unhappy.html)  Thanks!   Randy    Hey Redditors, I'm a psychologist and author (Your Depression Map) and would appreciate some help from any of you who might be interested.   Folks with depression spend a huge amount of effort trying to feel better and often feel that their progress is slow or nonexistent. But what if the goal was to go the other way - what would you do?  Imagine that 10 days from now you could win a large sum of money (in my groups, we make it $10 million - what the heck, it's imaginary) if you could make yourself MORE depressed for that 10th day than you have been for the past week.  The fine print: You can only do or change three things in your mind or life. And you can't list anything that's not in your own power to do (no alien invasions, no global economic meltdowns). We give you 10 days, because maybe some of your strategies won't work right away and require some time to build up.  I know, I know: No amount of money is worth it, etc. But thankfully it's a thought experiment, not a contract. And sometimes looking at what we could be doing to make it worse (and aren't) can help us see what we are actually accomplishing.  Anyway, that's my pitch. In return, I'll tabulate the answers and report back to this subreddit.  Thanks!  Randy      What bimmeric has spontaneously invented for him/herself is an approach called "Acceptance and Commitment Therapy" - the core of which is to demote emotions from their positions as masters and dictators of behaviour to the position of experiences and companions. ACT is extremely helpful for depression.   Keeping your goals high - what you "should be able to do" - will result, by nightfall every day, in a sense of defeat. Look at what you ACTUALLY accomplish most days.  Then create a short list of items that includes those things - even the things you already get yourself to do, like showering or getting out of bed by 3 pm. When you do something, no matter how trivial or ridiculous it seems to your self-critical mind, acknowledge that you did it and focus on that.   If you focus on what you have not accomplished, your emotions will reflect discouragement.  If you focus on what you DO accomplish, your emotions will correspondingly reflect encouragement. The boost will be small, and may be wiped out altogether until you master the knack of talking back to the dismissive part of the mind.   When a task seems overwhelming, it is always telling you the same thing.  "Make me smaller."   BTW: I recently posted in the Depression forum a link so that people can get a free copy of the Antidepressant Skills Workbook, a written-in-Vancouver (but exported around the world) guide designed for physicians to offer to depressed patients - but also for anyone to download on their own. Here's the link that'll get you to the download sites: http://www.changeways.com/resources/aboutdepression/scdp/scdp.html  One more free thing: I have an online course on diaphragmatic breathing available on Udemy. The usual charge is $15, but redditers can sign up for the course using the Coupon Code "breathingreddit" and get it for free until the end of April. Link: https://www.udemy.com/breathing-made-easy/  Breathe easy, redditers.      Thanks for the ideas, all.  I'm not a huge pubgoer but when the occasion arises it's often hard to think of a spot that doesn't assume its patrons are incapable of talking.   What is it with Vancouver pubs and restaurants and the televisions? If I wanted to watch TV I'd stay at home, and the ubiquitous flashing televisions are a distraction from anything else.    So redditors: Is there a good Vancouver pub that has enough confidence in itself that it DOESN'T have television?  	10

Just wondering?   That's what I said.   It was just a smart funny quick read. It's her story about dating in LA, her closeted gay "boyfriends", her ex who she lived together with for five years and who wrote a book calling her my fatassed girlfriend and sharing their stories without warning her and her version of their time together. It was just a funny honest look at herself and her love life and her struggle with the death of her beloved cat Emmit and having gone through a similar event with my wife's cat Noodles I could relate. I read it in a day and was just so enamored of it that when I finished it I tried the email address she had in the book to thank her for the nice few hours she had just given me and for her work on one of my favorite TV shows "My Name is Earl" and she answered back the next day! Here's a link to a story about her ex's books http://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/23/fashion/chad-kultgens-uncensored-voice-takes-a-more-serious-tone.html?pagewanted=all and here is her page I found after reading the book http://hilarywinston.com/home/ All in all a very nice thrift store find indeed.

 Anyone want to guess where Thor and Hulk will be during this? I'm guessing Thor will be in Asgard dealing with Loki and trying to find out what happened to Odin and Hulk will possibly be off world? on his own intergalactic adventure if the rumors are to be believed.           The original release of GTA 5. I think the game was impossible to get on ether the 360 or ps3 for at least a week. At least in my area.             Its still spider-man though. They don't have to market Miles Morales they just have to market spider-man.    If marvel and sony struck a deal to have Spider-Man in civil war but it was Miles Morales and not Peter Parker. How do you think people would react? would people care? I mean its still spider-man just not Peter Parker   I think a really cool franchise could be made out of Inception. It could be like the matrix mixed with a bit of bond/mission impossible action along with some spy thriller elements.And if they couldn't get DiCaprio to return then it could focus on the other members of the team and have the second and third film follow them around on other extraction jobs with an over arcing plot involving some sort of government conspiracy and cyber criminals and terrorists where they extract or plant ideas to prevent attacks and catch criminals etc. Any other ideas?   What on earth did I just watch? is this a porno?   it's gonna get a bit bumpy.   can we stop with the whole no pre order thing. this forum is about 5% of the total pc community. So its pointless telling people not to pre order it wont make a difference.    Interstellar would make a pretty sweet game.          This seems to be the "cool" answer to any half life 3 related post these days. But we all know you will still buy it day 1.    Halo and the possibility of a new Gears of war game in the future was my reason. I'm hoping microsoft will announce something awesome at this years E3 to make the purchase worth while other wise its just gathering dust.       they love it because it makes them feel special when they can say "my platform has this game so it must be better than your platform" and it also helps them justify their purchase even when they wont admit how crappy the console actually is.       Does anyone have any idea why marvel seem to have put it on the back burner for now? Everyone seemed damn sure we would get one in phase 3 but we didn't and now it looks like we might not even get one in phase 4. It looks like the Hulk will continue to be a supporting character in the avengers films which is kind of sad that marvel seem to be wasting Marks talent by using him once every 2-3 years for avengers films. Look I get that the Hulk isn't exactly an easy character to make a movie about due to him being a sort of anti hero if you will and it can be difficult to balance between Banner and Hulk but come on marvel give Hulk some love in phase 4 please!   Plus he lost to star lord in a humiliating dance off so who would want to return after that?   Your not gonna get that performance at $100. if you can add $40 you can get a 750ti.   http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814487025    I read the 960 uses 120w max at laod. So would a 500w psu be enough for SLI?   he said buses haha.    370x is probably gonna be a beast.       OP has bad taste.   are you sure you saw John Wick? because the John Wick I saw was bloody awesome. Beautifully shot and had one of Keanu Reeve's best performances.    I finally got to see it yesterday and I think it may be Michael Caine's best performance yet. That scene where Murph visits Professor Brand in hospital just before he dies, I was holding back man tears. Time and time again Caine continues to impress and Nolan keeps bringing out the best in Caine. Looking forward to what he does next.    lame spot. its all seen it , been there.    Can someone explain the ending as simple as possible because I got a bit confused when we get the bit where cooper appears to fall in to the black hole and time itself and how he communicates with his daughter through the watch. just want some clarification on it.    bullshit. no way it will make it close to mockingjay or guardians.    Noooo!    Do we know for sure that this is going to be about the bounty hunters stealing the death star plans? I heard a few other sites saying that its going to be the Han Solo film?   I think the court room drama has actually been the most entertaining stuff so far.    Totally agree. I hope they do a sequel.    Fool of a took!    old post is old.       I might. I'm not a HUGE fan of the RE games but I enjoyed them for what they are.    i say its Merlin cause in the promo you see him talking to team arrow and he presents the weapon Raz used to kill oliver. So how could of he gotten it if he wasn't there?   My planet just got Annihilated   You have to say it in the awesome Korean accent!    I'm guessing its Merlin.    aw   With Oliver potentially out of the picture for a while will Felicity give Barry a heads up on what happened?    Oliver will be dead the rest of the season until next season when Barry goes back in time and saves him.    Plot twist. They do another arrow vs flash crossover where barry goes back in time and saves him.    To be fair I didnt even notice till I saw this. So they must of done something right.       run some benchmarks for a an hour or so and check the temps.    yea this is a really interesting site. You can find other game companies on it to even VALVE.    sure you were drunk...    aye, its $109 on psn and xbox live.    wont work. they will deny your credit/debit card.    I enjoyed it. A lot of people are saying its average and doesn't deserve all the Oscar nominations it got but I disagree I think it does. Its a great film and its one of Bradley Coopers best performances. I hope ether American Sniper or Whiplash win Best picture.       its like the matrix meets superman.       The only reason Boyhood might win imo is because of the whole 12 year process behind it and Birdman wont win because its such a mixed bag. You ether like it or dislike it. Mean while Whiplash is more grounded and has great performances all round and its got the technical awards behind it to for best editing and sound which past best picture winners usually have as well.    Everyone seems to think whiplash is the under dog this year. Saying their happy its been nominated but no way it will win. I actually think it might. Anyone else?    even if thats the case it will pop up some where else quick enough.    cant tell if sarcasm or serious....    and me    unless you know someone in china who could buy it for you and  then gift it to you then yea your probably out of luck.    Under the mountain. I know Sam Neil did that real budget looking film but it was kinda crap. Would like to see a proper franchise made out of it.    Just buy the pc bro. your only going to more douche bags here trying to force you to build one.    If you dont want to build one dont. Ill get down voted for saying that but its your money and if your more comfortable getting a pre built then get it. Cyber pc are great. Highly Recommend.          yea the unfortunate side effects of ageing. I think DOFP was probably the last time well see these two together on screen as X-Men.    how long did you test it for? you can test for over 10 hours and still have an unstable overclock. These sound like symptoms of a bad oc.    It obviously means your oc is not stable.       anyone else think they should of attached it to ant-man instead? that movie could of done with the boost of ticket sales. Avengers 2 doesnt need the extra box office its already going to be a hit.    There has been an awakening, have you felt it?      So Im a bit confused about the time line in the upcoming x-men apocalypse film. Since everything has been reset in DOFP. Does apocalypse take place in a new universe post time line reset or is it before the reset? Im guessing its before since the original cast wont be returning because all of the x-men will be too young for the original actors . But its been confirmed for a while now that Hugh Jackman will return as Wolverine. So how does that work ? or will it be like DOFP and some of it will be in the past and future at the same time?   its their money they can spend it how they wish.             I think they sometimes do an easter sale cant verify that tho.    he could saved up for a couple months on a really tight budget? you dont know his current circumstances.    Matthew Vaughn Approves this shit!   Welp I could log in and get to the server list now its back to the way it was before, I cant even log in.    But the wait time is over an hour and half. WTF.    So I bought the game on steam and now im having trouble making an account. Do I have to use the same email as my steam account and do I have to use the same username as my steam account or not? im kinda confused. Because its saying my account doesnt have access.    Sony Offline Entertainment   I think it might of been too "out there" for the academy if that makes sense and it doesn't help that it wasnt released during oscar season.       Been trying for the last hour, no luck. Is anyone besides a couple of twitch streamers actually playing?   the entire franchise hinges on her being in the movie!   Just watched the film and im just wondering about the end. Did the investigation ever find out why the veteran Chris was helping killed him? I want to avoid going into conspiracy theories if possible but Im just curious about what happened.       what a weird month to push it back to. Like I can understand wanting to be on oscar season but why not November? Their brave releasing it so close to star wars.   http://variety.com/2014/tv/news/sherlock-season-4-2015-special-4-episode-1201256929/  The new season will consist of a special episode, which will begin filming in January 2015, and three episodes, which will commence production later in the year and will likely appear in early 2016.   season 4 will film later this year. when it airs idk. Right now their just filming the special.    i liked the amazing spiderman 2 so i actually want a third film.    inb4 left 4 dead is actually the superior game lmao.          Avatar  This trailer was beautifully put together, its a shame the movie didn't quite live up to the hype that came from it. Still enjoyed the final product tho.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5PSNL1qE6VY  Spiderman 3  This trailer got me so damn excited for venom and it still does. Just wish they could of done better by the character.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bzqHbTD64w  Inception  As great as inception was I still think its trailers were better than the movie itself especially this one the action, music and sound design in the trailer was miles above anything that was actually featured in the movie itself.  Still a great film tho again another one that was way over hyped thanks to a great trailer.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66TuSJo4dZM    I hope whiplash gets nominated for best picture.       I wont believe it till we get an official announcement. Ive been burned too many times by latino review. Id say there's a 50% chance is this is legit but wait till something official.       http://www.nintendo.com/nintendo-direct/01-14-2015/  Do you think well get any information regarding the 2015 pokemon game? or is it too soon?   I kinda wish Brandon Routh wasnt cast as the atom now that way he could of been superman in supergirl.    noo! are you crazy? the ending was phenomenal the way it is!    fuck, for some reason I first read this as avengers 2. Almost gave me a heart attack.    Would you ever consider directing a super hero movie for ether marvel or DC?       He was obviously joking you people need to learn how to detect sarcasm.          that's probably the truth of it to be honest It doesn't make financial sense for rockstar to have a team as large as the console development team working on a pc version they probably have like 5-10 guys working on the pc port who have no knowledge of how the pc architecture actually works they just assume that everything will translate smoothly because of the x86 architecture used on the new consoles but now their finding out that its actually not that easy.    you cant be stupid enough to think he was being serious?   it kind of is. I mean if you look back at something like the watchdogs delay that was like what a whole 6 months? to compare to something like that 2 months is a slight shift i guess its just how one interprets it.    I cant believe you people thought he was actually serious. He was obviously joking.    If I had to pick one Id say its because March is the end of their fiscal year so its just all 'money money money.     he was obviously joking , did you actually think he was serious? no one would ever do that.    I already have a ps4 and xbox one along with my pc. So it doesnt really matter.    Heck no. If your getting fps issues the problem lies else where.    the people having performance issues are the ones who have bottle necking issues. Their cpu is probably not up to the task. Like dont do something stupid and pair a 970 with a pentium cpu. ofc you will get bottle neck.       I will still buy it on PC when it comes out dont worry about that I just really want to play it right now. ive been waiting since last year when it came out on ps4/xb1.       I said to myself if it was delayed again Im gonna give on the pc version and just get it on console and that's exactly what Im doing. sorry guys but **** this. Im getting it on ps4 next week. Ive waited long enough to play this.    their talking about cpu cores.    I said to myself that if it was delayed again im gonna  give up on the pc version and get it on console and that's exactly what Im doing. sorry guys but **** this. Im getting it on ps4 next week. that's just how it is. I still have my pc but its time like these where my faith in Gaben tested.   Well I said to myself if it was delayed again ill give up get it on console and that's exactly what Im doing. sorry guys but **** this. Im getting it on ps4 next week.    Yes it does! the ending was too open ended, I want to see Christopher return with a huge as army of prawns and **** shit up.    ok here are some of mine.    Star Wars will flop and all of Disney's future plans for the franchise are scrapped it becomes the biggest flop of all time.   Furious 7 will be another smash hit in the fast and furious franchise spawning 3 more sequels. set for release in 2017,2019,2021 respectively.   Avengers age of ultron will top  avatars 2 billion dollars at the Box office. the huge success will cause marvel to change some of its phase 3 plans and bring avengers infinity war part 1 forward to 2017 and part 2 in 2018. The other films will have their dates shifted slightly but phase 3 will remain intact.   Ant-Man will be a surprise hit. Marvel will announce a sequel but will not give a release date. Many will suspect it wont be released until phase 4.   In February Marvel and Sony announce that Spiderman will return to marvel with a new trilogy of films, the first film will be announced for 2017 starring Andrew Garfield, Garfield will also feature in avengers infinity parts 1 and 2 with a cameo in Captain America: Civil War. As part of the deal sony will get a portion of the box office earnings.    The Avatar sequels finally begin principal photography in Wellington, New Zealand.   After the huge success of the final hobbit film. At comic con 2015 Warner bros announces a middle earth cinematic universe.Peter Jackson will be the creative visionary behind the universe he will be the WB version of Kevin Feige, the first film will be a trilogy of films based on the origin of the Witch King of Angmar the first film would release in 2017.   At comic con 2015 warner bros announces that batman v superman is split into 2 films with part 1 releasing in October and part 2 in march.   Fantastic Four is another surprise hit. making around $450 million at the box office. Fox is slightly disappointed but they still go a head with the sequel and believe they can make this new iteration of Fantastic Four into a money making franchise.    What an awesome movie. Beautifully shot. Especially the fight scene at the end reminded me a bit of the neo vs smith fight from the matrix with the rain and lightning in the background. So good.  This movie may have rebooted Keanu Reeves career in the best way possible. Lets hope he takes advantage of this success and we see him in more of these roles.    yea boi! NZ bros!   Doesnt this line from stark basically confirm he's the one who makes ultron?      I think the recording is gonna play a big part in the trial now.       Im going on holiday in Bali for a week in February from the 11th to the 18th which means Ill be missing out about a week of my course. Since I receive living costs and have an active Student Loan, will I need to contact them even though its just a week?    Comes out in April for me! so hyped.    April master race! so hyped!   yea it is.       Since bay is apparently out, they will need to having someone already working on it if they plan to make the projected 2016 release date. Any ideas who they might of picked?   Ive had it on my battle net account for a while but never bothered to give it a try. is it any good? worth trying out?   Furious 7.    There's still time to announce a delay.    I like how it acknowledges that its a parody of a Hollywood blockbuster.   it's not in the same universe so it doesn't matter.    Hes got a very particular set of skills,skills he has acquired over a very long career. so why not use them? let him do taken 4 imo   After seeing Whiplash I think he could pull it off. At times his character felt very isolated and was dealing with his own personal issues just like peter parker does and he played that very well. Not sure how well he would pull off spiderman tho. I've only seen him in whiplash so maybe someone else can chime in with their thoughts.    This just getting ridiculous and out of hand. Poor bloke needs help.    you can see the detail must be running at ultra, 4k, 60 fps.      you'd be surprised what they spoil in trailers these days. I would not be surprised at all if they spoiled something like that and used it as the big money shot of the trailer.    that makes no sense? if the game is on steam then the keys should be able to activate on it?   you know hes probably joking about buying the game right?   if its not delayed we should get something within the next 2 weeks. tho knowing rockstar we might not get anything till the day it comes out.    there's still 2 weeks till release calm your tits.    That is clean.    I check it every 5 minutes!   im talking about sam betraying rogers to team up with stark in civil war. This has nothing to do with Hydra.     .  that could actually make a really cool plot. Imagine the look of betrayal on rogers face when his second best friend next to buck betrays him.   You have to remember that what happens to Odin all depends whether or not Anthony Hopkins decides to return for Thor: Ragnarok.If he returns then obviously he could be alive just in Odin sleep or if he doesnt return then they have an excuse to kill him off.    I actually like SC 2013 come at me bro   DAMN IT I FELL FOR IT!   Shouldn't the game have gone gold by now? why haven't we heard anything about the pc version finishing development?   we just got the witcher 3 requirements and that's not out till May. Something is going on here and I don't like the Silence.    Does anyone find it weird steam still says early 2015 and not january 27th? Normally games this close to release have a countdown showing how much time their is till release. Maybe rockstar isnt putting january 27th on the steam page in case they do need to delay?    Been a while since I last heard news about it. Is it still happening?   your doing it wrong man. i live in New Zealand and never pay more than $65 for a new release game. And games are expensive as shit here. Thank GabeN for online Key stores.    what on GabeN's earth is this? no offence but this is a terrible build. You can do a lot better for that price. Hope you didnt buy this yet. This one is better. http://pcpartpicker.com/b/ZB9WGX   Dude Ikr! the GOW1 port is so good. It runs really well. Makes me sad Cliffy B never put the second or third game on pc cause of pirating.    we need to show developers that we support pc games. Too many developers are scared of putting their games on pc cause of people downloading them and if we ever want halo or gears of war back on pc gta v will need to do well in sales to convince other developers that the pc game market is still strong and that its worth the time and money to have an extra team during development to make a pc port.       I remember back in high school stealing chocolate bars from my local super market and putting them down mah pants...back in the day. I was young and shit and quite the rebel to ,hehe.i remember being pretty good at it to tbh. I also remember getting away with some whipped cream and later spraying some of it all over some poor buggers car and then threw it down a ditch some where on my home. I also remember getting a way with a copy of Command and Conquer tiberian sun from a local computer store.   This movie is awesome.I loved the animation and Baymax was an awesome character. Hope they do a sequel and this is easily in my top 10 movies of 2014.   Na the ending will more than likely involve ether Fury,Stark or Rogers visiting him and offering him to join the avengers.    All disney have said is holiday 2015 so around the time the force awakens is released.    use pcsx2 and play em?   up vote for dat edginess.    After seeing whiplash him being in spiderman 2 made me appreciate that movie a little more.    Before Iron Man 3 came out I remember reading that Disney decided against using the Demon in a bottle story line and went with PTSD instead.Any idea why it didn't make the final cut? I'm still kinda hoping we get some hints or nods of Demon in a bottle in future films especially with Civil   Infinity War coming up.       ill probably get downvoted for this but wouldnt it be bad for their sponsorship with antec to do this?   Damn the reference cooler is sexy as hell.       your cpu is a bit of a bottle neck.    this is my favorite part of attack of the clones.       I would of also cut the joke at the end about changing the name. it still ruins a other wise seriously toned trailer. But other wise good job :)   This looks awesome! There is no stopping marvel now boys!    These things are pointless imo.    Isn't it supposed to be out by now?   because it would of been weird. seeing the guy who's gonna be vision in the future playing a character in the past   Maybe next year ill get a 4k TV. Hopefully by then they'll drop in price.   	200
 I would not recommend smoking in the dorms; the way the smell travels in a dorm and the risk of getting caught or tattled on by an RA, shitty roommate, or custodian could not only get you in trouble but also make you super paranoid. This warning being said, though, making stoner buddies is an awesome, easy process that helps with developing a new core of friends, and this process is much easier to do in a dorm because such a living area offers floor activities such as pillow fights, folf games, etc. and encourages residents to be comfortable with the people around them. Also, smoking off campus encourages you to go find cool outdoor spots, which beat out indoor spots any day of the week in my mind. The most important thing to remember, though, is that academics should take precedence when you're at college; you don't necessarily need to cut down on your habits, but be sure to tackle your school work before you toke. You're now having to pay for your education; make the most of it!    Nice! How would i do that?   To me, magnanimous has a kind of rugged beauty like that of a handsome mountain man or grizzled soldier.   Man, I am super envious that you have the option to smoke at a coast area. I went to Oregon when I was younger and thought the state's coast's gray color and slight chill were charming and unique.  	4
             It probably knows it shouldn't have knocked over that bowl of glitter               	9
 My favorite Star Wars ship is the Voyager, and my favorite Star Trek captain is Han Solo.   Huge fan Bill!  Just wanted to ask, what are your thoughts on all of the gifs on the internet with you in them?   I cannot up-vote this enough........   I hadn't seen any simple C++ libraries for the Oculus Rift other than the normal SDK, which seemed a bit overly complicated, so a friend and I made one for our senior project.  It also includes support for the Microsoft Kinect, and I'll be adding support for the recent updates to the Rift SDK soon.  I've also got a new Kinect 2.0 that I plan to add as well.  https://github.com/gemisis/Project-Virtua  We have a website over at http://www.projectvirtua.com that includes documentation and stuff too.  There's also some example projects you can look at as well there.   If you could go back in time and change one thing about the original Tony Hawk's Pro Skater games, what would you change and why?  Side note, huge fan! :D   It's the one where [Hey, Who turned out the lights?](/spoiler)      $20 I don't have sadly.  Most of the tech here I'm either borrowing or was given to me as a gift.   If I had the money for UE4 that may have been an option, but assuming it has Kinect support then yes, that would look better. Big goal here was to do so on a low software budget.    Yeah, we were kind of pressed for time XD I'll try and get a better demo setup at some point that shows the Kinect off. First goal is to get it to use the new alpha sensor though.    	10
 1. Why not take out Hitler instead of shipping the Jews? There were a hand full of people pivotal to the Nazi movement, why not just take them out? Or better, prevent their births? 2.Why not prevent the wars? Once you start to change anything, you alter the course of history. The future as we know it will no longer exists. The wars will be inevitable. And wherever it is you ship the Jews to, it is likely they will meet the same fate in the hands of another.  I think the approach of trickles over time will work. But when you start to make 'changes' then I don't think it will work out so well.   You have put a lot of thought into this, haven't you? Gold week deserved.   We are in agreement on this very point. It should be that every one gets the proper training and directed guidance customized to them. And not in a one-sided manner. Education in a a broader sense. Basically equipping them whatever they need for a given type of work as well as for being a human being. This should include also intangible things.   Your argument is duly noted.   These are good and interesting points. I believe the disconnect here is in the idea that every one needs some type of instruction and training. Whatever you call the avenue, it is an institution of learning.   Let me get this straight: you think that somehow hiring someone with a Masters degree in computer science and paying for an h1b visa etc just to have them work for you is cheaper than hiring an American with equal qualifications.  Also, when the owner of said company tells you that there is a shortage, it is nothing but obdurate obstinacy to insist that 'it', the shortage, is a myth. Where do you find your data to back up your claims that there is sufficient supply? Why do you think so many foreigners are lining up to go to school here if there isn't an abundance of demand or shortage of supply of those with their respective degrees? But don't let any of what I say stop you from holding dearly to your opinion, after all, this is a free country... Right?   I find this disturbing. It 'sounds' funny' and 'amusing' but you may be in serious need of help. This sounds like a very toxic psychic state to be in. You should be blissful about the opportunity to continue your activities on this new day.   You're right, you are beneath his level.   My point exactly. Let's keep ignoring the 100s of thousands of educated people who built and maintain Microsoft. If which many had to be imported from India and China because people like this don't see a need to educate Americans. So sad.   That's the problem with your reasoning. It is assuming that the gifted ones come from a background of privilege. Do you see the demographics in graduate school? Hmm? You are looking at life from a1950s lens. You can not do anything in this world without at least a college education. And even if you did, you would need a week educated labor force to execute. The 'labor' you speak of, that is, the skilled manufacturing and similar work from the 50s are the programmers and engineers of today.  Please stop this idea that education is not necessary. Why do you want to keep importing education from abroad and allowing your own people to wake away?   "...You'll learn things you never knew you never knew.."   This is one of the very reasons to which a government owes it's very existence.   Even if we didn't have the supervision problem. Uneducated people create a third world country. They also don't do things like build internet, smartphones, or Reddit... I should know, I'm from one!   I was simply trying to map your words on data and experience and the brain to what we know about computers.   Have you tried mapping this idea to an actual computer? How does that framework hold up? Do the same conclusions hold?   Sounds like you have "all" the answers you need.   Edit: your strong dissention is duly noted   It would solve nothing. Nothing will ever convince anyone of anything they do not already believe or not believe.  Such evidence will be dismissed and the investigators' reputation called into question.  One likely scenario is scientists misunderstanding what they have found and forming a new religion and this new religion will promptly being rejected by all existing ones. And so the chain continues...    Your cells are replaced daily. I think on average you are entirely 'replaced' every 1.5 years or so. I forget what the math is.   Think about having two bio-suits. Actually, even simpler, think about your clothes. How many do you have? More than two, right? What exactly is going on with your other clothes when 'you' are not wearing them? They are simply lifeless no? 'You' give life to 'your' body. Without 'you', 'your' body is lifeless. It is dead. So perhaps having another suit made will simply result in it being in some kind of vegetative state or just cold and without life. Unless you can figure out a way to plug yourself into it, like changing clothes, then it is impossible to move from one body to another. I think of this in a similar way to how it is when you sleep.... Actually, this may be the best way to explain it. Perhaps the one body will simply fall into a deep coma/sleep-like state while you occupy another.  But really, i don't think this idea is possible. It is much more plausible to think of some way to propagate the body from one location to another. Perhaps we should focus on transporting a piece of stone first?   Then use it as a working hypothesis. There are things constituent of matter, which we know 'hypothetically' to exist but are yet unable to measure, or detect simply because we do not have the instrument powerful enough to measure these things. On a much more fundamental level, if something was not made up of matter, but something else. Some other substance, call it ethereal or typeB. We know from physics that it will be impossible to have any direct measurement or 'evidence' of said substance using material instruments or tools. You need the right tool fashioned for the right purpose. Otherwise it will be like trying to detect x-rays with a radio or water with a net....   It's about moderation (in the absolute sense not after you have altered your taste buds). You can train yourself to be just as satisfied with less salt if you take the time to tapper down. Your tongue will become more sensitive and require less salt to get the same sensation. Just in the same way with sugar and all else.    This is the problem with the idea that what is the real you is physical. This body along with the brain is just a bio-machine, wet-ware. Like an exoskeleton used by the actual you for an earth-life. You are plugged in during pregnancy, and disconnect once it is destroyed or no longer functional due to irreparable damage or wear and tear from aging. It's really not so difficult to accept this is it?   100% efficiency solar cells. Some integer-fraction-speed-of-light-travel transport device. And, wait for it, quantum learning pod (ala Vulcan learning pod). #thatisall   I think you should be more worried about the salt/sodium additives in preserved food than actual table salt.   Is any body correcting for increase in movie ticket prices or inflation?   So, let me put it this way: Reading any of what you've quoted, 'holy' or 'good' is about the last thing that can ever be likened to it. It reads more like gruesome, noisome, disgust, or vermin. Nothing of what is written in any of these books even sounds holy or good. And we all know who the usual suspects are when things are turned on their head and start to stink: man. This sounds very much like man's idea not something 'good' or 'holy'   Is the "beast" the government, corporations or is it simply you and I as a depraved collective unit? Government - I don't have any brilliant ideas except collective action. Similar to what the 'patriots' in days of yore did. Corporations - avoid products and services directly and indirectly. Again this requires collective action.  And so the only logical conclusion here is that all of these point back to us as a collective unit being the proverbial beast.   This is me just thinking out loud...   Clearly.   Congress 14.0 beta. I wonder what new features come with it...   Or put your money where your mouth is and stop feeding the beast. Each day we read about corporate practices we don't like and still consume, directly or indirectly, and invest in the these same corporations. Why?   From such a small sample, you can't call it a study..   Not if my upvote on your comment about upvoting it has anything to say about anything your comment has to say about it!   Sounds wonderful. I rejoice with you friend. Now, don't mess it up :)   Wow. Such a thing is very transient. Meaning she will outgrow such childish behavior sooner rather than later. If she was as great as you say, is have slowly helped her see how stupid her behavior was, and help her fix it.   Maybe we should ask the hormonal police officer that question....   Yeah, there's a video of what actually happened and the woman in question was yelling racial profanity and instigated a verbal and physical assault. The age of one sided lies are over, we have video proof now.   I wish more of us would see life this way. What is the point of a life if it isn't to the service of others? What really is the point? Fleeting, trivialities that amount to nothing.  	37
 Are you being sarcastic?    Seriously?                I just can't find a real compass!      Ones that can work on mobile devices too.        I heard border collies really go crazy if you don't give them something to do. I'm worried my pooch gets bored when I'm not home. Border collies are dogs bread for work. They love work, even if it's a simple task. So what activities or "jobs" could my Border collie do?   I asked r/ vfx, but I want an answer from a larger community.   I don't understand the pricing system. I pay 495 upfront, then what?  (I plan on buying the commercial version.)        Greetings Reddit, I think I'm done.  I can't take it anymore! I have no one to talk to!   I'm such a loser, one of my teachers has a strong disliking towards me, I live in my cousin's shadow, and my dad was never there for me...   One day at school, I had had it. I was gonna do it. I tried to tell myself that I was being irrational.    I went to the counselor. They called my mom. Rather than being supportive or consoling, she got onto me for telling the school, saying that they're going to label me.   I wanted to talk to my dad, but he is overseas. He doesn't give enough of a care.   I have no one to talk to. I'm a popular guy, and have many friends, too many to count, but yet, I have no one to talk to!    My parents and my friends are only concerned for themselves. It's always them, not me...   I can't tell you how many times I've been cheated out of birthday celebrations, or have never been called by my dad.    I can't do it Reddit!    How would this abandon all of that?     I've been on minecraft since Alpha. I loved it. I grew with it. I was 10 at the time of classic. Oh the fun!    Everyone hates the updates, and so did I for a while. But I'm starting to like them. I think horses and the armor stands give minecraft a medieval feel.    What is your stance on the updates?     We need them. C.nerd.nu is stuck in the olden days without them. With slimeblocks, we can create flying machines. We can venture into the skies of minecraft, we can safely venture into the void. This is the final frontier...     I feel like the community is dieing. I don't want Minecraft to end. Minecraft is a beacon of hope in the hell that is the gaming world, it is a fresh page that stands out against the all the "GUNZ BLAZIN COD FPS".    Minecraft doesn't feel fun anymore. It feels like it's dragging with all the recent updates. What do we do? I don't want minecraft to die!      Oh my god op... Give us the seed or instructions how to generate a world like that!     Tell us about the greatest things that have ever happened on vanilla servers. For me it was this battle we had against a guy who created this army of mobs. He built a fortress literally IN the layers of the farlands. This was beta of course.   Tell us your vanilla nostalgia stories and feel free to list the ip to a vanilla server in the comments:      Thank you for the advice!     Hello my good comrades. I'm 14 and am interested in that of a filmmaking career. I want to create top-notch effects, to do this, I feel the only professional tools for me would be The Foundry's Nuke. The thing is, this costs $4000. I've had this dream of becoming a filmmaker for a long, long time, since I was a wee lad!    My parents won't allow me to work a real or summer job just yet, so what might I do until then?      I'm about to be 14, and would like to have a career as a filmmaker. I want my cgi to be top-notch. I want it to be so good, it gets featured on the Cgbros YouTube page. So, I would like to aquire a copy of The Foundry's Nuke. The thing is, this software costs about $4000. My parents won't let me get a job yet, so I've turned to r/beermoney. Being an avid user of the subreddit, I saw how someone went to Vegas on their "beermoney", so if they can go to Vegas, I can get Nuke, how hard can it be? Harder than you think my friends...Vindale looked very attractive, but my hopes were dashed when I found it charges you for the products you test. I turned to swagbucks, which promised $35 per survey, but my hopes were crushed yet again when I realized these offers are only to reel you in, after that you get a survey every two months for only $0.02.   I need advice. What might I do?     I want to start a career as a filmmaker, to accomplish this, I'm going to need to get a copy of The Foundry's Nuke. This vfx and compositing software is used in every film from Gravity, to Star Trek, to Transformers, you name it, Nuke is in it! The thing is, this software costs about $4000. My parents don't really want me working a job yet, so what might I do?   Being an avid user of r/beermoney, I've always wanted to try a bunch of paid surveys, and maybe in 1-2 years I could get the money, but I'm afraid of scams, so I really need some advice!         Did it get taken down? It was from 2010 or 11.   I downloaded an app called badoo, put my profile as a member of isis, messed with people, someone legitametely called the police. I am in Texas.              It's turning into an rpg.     He played Saruman. He could be a great Herobrine. "There will be no dawn...for Minecraftians!"        Also, does the student version give you watermarks and only let you render in less than HD?           Say I torrent a music creating software and publish my works and make money off said works, is that illegal?         Saw this on /3DCG/. The question was, "If I used a pirate bay torrent to download The Foundry's Nuke (A vfx Software) and use it to create little short films like FreddieW on YouTube, would it be illegal if I used Google Ads and made money off of the videos I created with the software I downloaded with a torrent?"       I see places where you can find after effects, MODO, Cinema 4d and all those goodies for sometimes half-price, but are there any good places where you can find a copy of The Foundry's Nuke for $2500-1000 at least?   	46
 Based on your "corporations are people" and "taxing the church" comment; I think you've got a bit of learning to do yourself before you start lashing out at other people.   I'm confused now. What else do German men wear?   Let's not forget second best rebounder.   Kevin Love *killed* amare and dirk last season,   Just enter two line-breaks instead of one to create a new line :)   1. **Annie Hall - Woody Allen - 1977**: The greatest comedy ever made, was masterfully composed by its nonlinear storytelling, and the disappointing and undramatic ending hit harder because it made the movie feel so much more grounded in reality despite its hyper-exaggerated quirkiness. Also, just plain goddamn hilarious.  2. **The Godfather parts I and II - Francis Ford Coppola - 1972, 74**: The greatest story ever told in American cinema. While the writing, acting, cinematography, are all near-perfect; the biggest mark is the elegance with which Michael Corleon's transformation is shown. No mafia film since has gone by without avoiding the shadow of this movie's legacy.  3. **North By Northwest - Hitchcock - 1959**: it feels like it was the precursor to the Bond films, but with Hitchcock quality direction. It is the both the essential action movie, and the essential mistaken identity movie.  4. **Barry Lyndon - Kubrick - 1975**: Almost every single scene takes on an otherworldly characteristic with the incredibly beautiful shots of the European countryside.   5. **Once Upon A Time In The West - Sergio Leone - 1968**: This was the ultimate spaghetti western director at the height of his power. In my (unpopular) opinion, it has both a superior soundtrack and a more mature story than The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly.  6. **There Will Be Blood - P.T. Anderson - 2007**: a performance for the ages by DDL, masterful direction by Anderson, ripe with symbolism and analytically dense. It's a modern day wet dream for movie lovers.  7. **2001: A Space Odyssey - Kubrick - 1968**: I could talk about this movie for hours. It has so many thematic layers hidden behind an extraordinary depiction of space and a brilliantly anthropomorphized robot antagonist.   8. **Apocalypse Now - Coppola - 1979**: One of the most deep and fascinating explorations of human psychology through the medium of a war, conveyed through an Odyssey-esque journey.  9. **Lawrence Of Arabia - David Lean - 1962**: This is the definitive hollywood epic. The grandiosity is complemented by such a stark contrast in the humane and relatable personal struggle. This is what a 'blockbuster' should be.  10. **Who's Afraid Of Virginia Woolf? - Mike Nichols - 1966**: there's something sharp and gripping and poignant about the dialogue in this movie. It rips into your soul and surfaces again for air over and over again for 2 hours.  And I really, really, really wanted to put Fargo, Manhattan, It happened one night, and the LOTR trilogy. Ten just isn't enough :(   Fuck my life.   Even if Orlando was going for full on tank-and-rebuild; we could have and should have done a hell of a lot better than Mo Harkless as our young talent acquisition; and we should have found a way to acquire better draft picks than 2017-lottery-protected first rounders. Orlando unequivocally loses huge, no matter which way you look at it.   Our lineup going into this season looks something like Jameer-Affalo/Redick-Hedo-Big Baby-Gustavo Ayon; with Vucavic, Harkless, Nicholson, and whatever point guard we sign coming off the bench. It's going to be a depressing stretch of 18-28 win seasons for the magic going forward.   You are everything that's wrong with America.   I'm actually mad at the absurd lack of young talent we're getting for dwight. I really wanted the Rockets to be involved in this trade :/   ...That's not really how cancer works though.   Ha ha. You are so inflammatory and masterful with your trolling. It must feel really great.   Kareem would like a word with your word with johnydoom.   Holy hell. Australia played them tough as nails for 34 minutes and then **BAM!**   Is there a box score of this game somewhere that doesn't suck like NBC's?   Some very dubious calls going in America's favor -_-   I guess the olympic spirit got the best of him.   If we're not at our best, it's going to be even worse for you guys when you lose to us :p   Greg Reid, now this... *COME ON*  I have this heartbreaking feeling we're going to anomalously be ravaged by injuries/off the field issues for the second season in a row, finish something like 10-3, be ranked in the high-teens, and considered a huge disappointment again.     Okay. So that's probably a bit panicky. I'm just ready for the season to start.    I just thought it was a funny general example, because Florida might be the most apocalyptic legal market in the nation right now. 11 law schools + none of them having much/any interstate reach = *nobody* who goes to law school in Florida is reasonable safe the way a lot of "good regional placement" state schools are.   You haven't seen Florida's employment stats I'm guessing. The best way to get a job in Florida is to go to a really high ranked school and have contacts and connections in Florida.   And be honest.   Wait. Which continent are you talking about?   Loving the troll flair.   That article was awful.   It seems like the genuine coolness of the TED empire started declining almost completely in sync with its widespread growth in popularity. It's sad to see TEDx talks that are sometimes legitimately awful; and it's now even more sad to see, as the author put it 'that TED is no longer a responsible curator of ideas worth spreading."'   Tax. Not even a competition.   Some combination of   1. Something you're interested in doing, given the very high likelihood of deciding not to go to law school  2. Something that will allow you to maintain the highest gpa possible. Think 3.9-4.0  Depending on your interests, you might be forced to pick one of the two. But if you want to go to law school, having an absurdly high GPA is *enormously* helpful.      Nope. There's only one way in which "tiers" is used when talking about a law school, and that's in reference to its national ranking. And John Marshall is a tier-4, for what it's worth.   tl;dr- if people *tried* harder to get jobs, then more jobs will magically appear.   Let A connote "eating a butterfinger" and B represent "you are thirsty." the first part of the statement is simplified to "if A, then B" and the only other logical statement we can create from that is the contrapositive "If not B, then not A" which would expand to "If you are not thirsty, then you did not eat a butterfinger."  So your friend's statement rephased: "if B, then A" does not logically follow from "If A, then B"; is sound logic and he should be congratulated.   "Hitherto there has been no thought I have been afraid of; if I should run across such a thought, I hope that I have at least the sincerity to say, 'I am afraid of this thought, it stirs up something else in me, and therefore I will not think it.' If in this I do wrong, the punishment will not fail to follow."   (Kierkegaard)    Wait.... really?   Why are there SO MANY FOULS this game??   The Nigerian defense was so painfully bad... they would have had to start rigging their own shots to miss if they had wanted their fg% to drop below 50%.   This title/message is so confusing. WHICH ONE ARE WE SUPPOSED TO RESPOND TO?   Some of my favorites right now: Barry Lyndon, Lawrence of Arabia, Once Upon A Time In The West, North by Northwest, Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf, Apocalypse Now.   I know what you mean about just doing it to check items off a list, I definitely think there are a handful of films I just watched and moved on from, and are probably already due for a rewatching. But I think having that list there was the best way to just start plunging into cinema from scratch.      Aw man, I love the Yuffie sidequest.   that scene bugged me, because every time his ex did something to get hotter her hotness axis didn't increase, her crazy axis decreased.   At first I thought the author was just saying "you should find more tactful and creative ways of saying these things." But some of his commentary is just really poor and wrong (see: 2, 7). For 4 and 5 he's just contradicting himself by saying that you *should* say them, but don't do it right away. Well, duh.    I can understand that. But I think the point is for the rest of the congregation to know to reach out to them. I was visiting a church that did this; and several people came up to talk to me and help get acquainted. It was nice.    If he had any decent offensive threats at the 4 and 5  You say that like Carlos Boozer isn't a decent offensive threat? I mean, I understand why the Bulls hate him; but the demonizing is kindof hilarious sometimes.   **That's even worse**   He's come even farther since Angels in the Outfield.   Ew.   I've worked there. They don't.    If it's any consolation, I hate you on the inside as well.   Meh; I think that there are too many good power forwards in the west: Love, Dirk, Aldridge, the manimal, Blake Griffin, Demarcus Cousins, Pau.  Combined with the fact that Anderson went from being the Magic's second scoring option to now having to share the ball with The Brow, Austin Rivers, Eric Gordon, and company. I'd be legitimately shocked if Anderson makes an all-star team while in NO.   Eh. Most lists I've ever seen have Kareem above Bird.    Just try "hey, how are you" then. Ladies are often interested in the mysterious.  This is actually a terrible idea. Women almost never reply to thoughtless messages, because most of the time they just assume the guy is mass messaging, or under the rationale of "he didn't put in any time for me, so why should I for him?"  The key is to keep it a couple sentences long, ask conversation-starting questions about things she put on her profile, and don't sound stupid.   It also gives you a LOT less leeway if you're trying to differentiate between an A- (which is usually 90-92) and A (which is 93+).   RYAN ANDERSON COME ON PEOPLE.   Ryan Anderson has a much bright future already than Gallinari.   At least we still have ~~A great young PF in Ryan Anderson~~   ~~And awesome head coach~~   ~~A ton of cap space to work with~~   ~~Daniel Orton coming along nicely~~   Hedo Turkoglu!   I'm actually pretty positive it was meant in jest, and people upvoting origibanality didn't quite get that, or are willfully ignoring it.   Lost in a world of condescending intellectualism through middle school, aficionado of the inner workings of their thought processes by 16. My guess is that now he's about to start his freshman year of college, and spent the summer rigorously outlining his magnum opus "the psychology of man."   *redoubles stalking efforts*    Eh, that's not universal. I know a good handful of guys who ended up dating (and subsequently marrying) girls they were good friends with first.   Ummm no. The revenue of single stores can come close to 4 million dollars a year. That second number is completely wrong.   If by "large portion" you mean like .001%   Correct, it's served on a lightly toasted and lightly buttered hamburger bun with pickles.   But why make a list of something; and then put a player on that list for criteria completely unrelated to that list?  Not to mention, it's not even a safe assumption. To project he's going to have a better career than someone like Isiah Thomas or Allen Iverson is just *far* from being very likely.   How can someone realize that Malone was a 2x MVP, one of which was over '97 Michael Jordan? Not to mention he's second all-time behind Kareem in career points, enjoying one of the longest stretches of quality play *ever*, and still ranking him behind Kevin McHale?  We're talking an 11 time all-nba first teamer vs. 0 time all-nba any teamer.  This is frustrating.   This is a list that already has Kevin Durant at #25. I'm not putting much stock into it.   Why would your order a spicey chicken sandwich at the original one? They have HAMBURGERS AND FRIED OKRA there.   Chick fila's are very likely the most profitable franchises of all fast food in the southeast. A "decent" franchise can see 11k-12k in revenue on a good day. Choosing to franchise a chick fila could have very well been a financial decision, and there was probably no reason to expect boycotts in the near future.   Replace dinner table with middle school cafeteria.    I don't see too much of a problem with the military acting on a policy of "would be beneficial" rather than "need." Especially since the state of modern warfare is almost completely preventative.    No. But Chopin was bad ass.   We both share a birthday with Chopin and Justin Bieber. Yeah!   TIL I am dyslexic.    I feel bad for not knowing if you're being serious. Like maybe there's some paid bible study service somewhere that I've never heard of or something.   Rest assured, I am very afraid of how hard you are going to take it on me.   Building muscle in conjunction with some cardio, what football players do, is probably more healthy than distance running is.   Yep. Also, as a distance runner, the injury stockpile can be incredibly high (in the same realm as football) as well.    Yep, also football is so incredibly king in America, I don't think it'll come close to losing that status in the next 40-50 years.   wouldn't those be the same option though?   Yep. the word "kobe" on a menu means literally nothing about the meat.   I think he'll be a fantasy basketball steal this year.   Iwasjoking.   that's more statisticsy than sciencey; and you don't fuck with statistical validity.   Ugh, this subreddit is kindof a mess.   No way. Malone was absolutely better than Barkley. They had comparably good peaks, and Malone's absurd longevity gives him a huge edge.   Yep, Dwight is still significantly better offensively.   Better players =/= bigger roles *or* better stats.   I feel like citing to PER will get you mass-downvoted in r/nba. Especially if you mention rondo is ranked 21st among point guards in PER.   Make it 7' and I'm in.   Nah, most people could get a solid understanding of the relevant (to them) tax code by reading an hour a day for 2-3 months.  It's not like the only way to learn it is to read the freaking code itself either, there are supplements that break it down quite nicely for you.   Except recognition on investment income is, in most cases, easily deferred, so your second to last paragraph is pragmatically moot.   FWIW, accountants, lawyers, and bankers can all go up to 85-90 hours a week in the "big-4, biglaw, BBB" arena (not often, but not uncommon).   Lawyers in that field *start* at 160k out of law school in big markets (NYC, DC, some Chicago firms), accountants start 60-90k but have a turtle climb to a much much higher ceiling. I don't know what the starting salary is for big-market banking, but they have by far the highest ceiling of all.    This is actually false! For tax purposes your income is only reduced by the amount that interest accrues on those loans. So technically you're making about -850ish a year.   teenage parenthood.    I've taken about 30 LSAT exams, and I can only remember that being the case once or twice.   That's nonsensical though. If you do something, you're still by definition trying to do it first, regardless of your level of confidence.   When someone says "I'm not going to be able to pick up that rock," "I'll try to pick up that rock," and "I'm going to pick up that rock," they're still going to try to pick up that rock in all three scenarios. The middle one is just a neutral statement of fact without a predictive assertion.    You can have R v Dudley and Stephens... Enjoy it.   If you be the awesome SO I will definitely marry you.  Note: I will be a *slightly-above-average* SO.   Ugh.   IIRC there were eyewitness reports of the other team feeding him the ball at the end of the game to get to 100.   1. Yeah... that really diminished the coolness, knowing off the top of my head that one of these was definitively wrong.  2. 3 personal jurisdiction.   2. Can you cite a source then? Do you see how the second sentence doesn't logically validate the first?  5. If you're making an argument against the death penalty, it seems fair to have complaints that are narrowly tailored against the death penalty; and not broad problems with the entire justice system.  7. Spread out across the nation? That's really not much at all, and that amount would likely be doing nothing right now other than easing municipal and state budget crises to a very small degree.   -still upvoted you though because discussion is good.   Magic had already been retired for a full year when he was on the Dream Team. Bird's back was going out and he was a year away from retiring as well. Either way, that shouldn't shock you for rebounds because  Charles Barkley was a considerably better rebounder than any of the three, which makes sense because he was a power forward and they were a shooting guard, point guard, and small forward respectively.   Points/steals is still legitimately surprising, but not entirely when you consider that all-star teams tend to lead to historically wonky results; especially with such a high random chance of variation (from such a small set of games). Take for instance the [box score](http://www.usabasketball.com/misc/12_mnt_exh_05_box.pdf) of the latest game between USA and Spain. Carmelo led the team in points despite the fact that he was 6th in the league in [points-per-game](http://espn.go.com/nba/statistics/player/_/stat/scoring-per-game/sort/avgPoints/year/2012/seasontype/2) and all five players in front of him were also on the roster.    Your second point doesn't logically follow- It's very possible that it is a deterrent, and is preventing an even *higher* rate of murder. States could   Your fifth point seems moot because that's true for minorities across just about all non-white collar crimes. So it will only naturally extend.  Your seventh point is just kind of silly because the number of executions multiplied by the difference in cost between a life sentence and a death penalty is negligible compared to just about any program that could create real societal change.    I think as a big man being drafted #1 overall, you're kindof inherently expected to be a good rebounder and at least a decent defender.   ehhhhh. I think you'd be stupid to say he doesn't even have an argument for top-10 all time, but I don't think he's "easily" top-10. For instance, you could very well make a convincing (or at least, a respectable) argument that 1. Jordan 2. Kareem 3. Wilt 4. Russell 5. Magic 6. Bird 7. Shaq 8. Tim Duncan 9. Oscar Robinson 10. Hakeem 11. Lebron James 12. Karl Malone are better than him on the all time list right now.  I do think he's a top-10 all time player, but you can't deny there's a certain subjectivity to it; and Kobe could definitely be excluded from that top 10 amongst the wiggle room. I could see him being anywhere from 7th to 13th.   Not as much, but that statistic about Bowden is wrong as presented.   Only in division 1 though.   Does that really count as an infographic?  	107
 I can understand the Teamsters, but I'm not too familiar with the situation in the Ironworkers and Pipefitters. What do you think were the points in dispute ? Were there actually meetings or was the whole matter handled by email without any member input ? There are a lot of questions here.   Yes, I've always found 'The Conversation' to be interesting, informative and well written. It's well worth following.   I think you're right. The part that gets me in the quote you post is the "outside of nature" part.   It can be useful, and I'd encourage it. One thing to keep in mind, however, is that the centers are usually funded by other unions and community groups. It would vary on a case by case basis as to how much 'gymnastics' have to be done to stay on their good side.   Yes, SPF ??.   I think that's probably a good suggestion. Of course I'm only the reposter, but maybe you should write the Pew Center about it. I don't know if they can easily edit their article or not, but it's worth a shot.   I get a chuckle out of such typos as well. I wonder if it was the human or the computer that made the mistake.   I wish you well. One thing that puzzles me... in your second paragraph you seem to be saying that your latest episode was less severe "because of facebook" Am I reading you right ? If I am correct about this it gets me thinking about the "how" of such a thing. Continual useful feedback perhaps ?   Thank you. This is a valuable contribution to the debate.   Well perhaps, but consider the most massive and rapid 'language spread' in human history. Language expansion such as English, Portuguese and French in the New World were obviously correlated with a gigantic 'gene flow'. The case of Spanish varies from country to country, but its presence in countries such as Chile, Argentina, Uruguay and the whole of the Hispanic Caribbean is also an example of gene flow/language change. In the case of the Caribbean there was a 100% replacement of the genes of previous occupants who spoke languages other than Spanish, English, French and Dutch.   So...language change doesn't *always* correlate with gene flow, but in some cases the 'gene flow', often an euphemism for genocide, is the sole only explanation. It all depends on the situation.   That's the implication.   It puzzles me as well. The difference is so wide that I'm at a loss to explain it by factors such as smoking, obesity, etc.. On the other hand what innate sexual factor could cause such a disparity in this one type of cancer but not in others ? There's room for a lot of speculation here.   When you repost something from another subreddit it is considered courteous to mention that it is a repost. This was originally posted at r/worldanarchism.   Sorry, my error.   Yep, that's the item. I believe that it was first described in Naples which had extensive trading relations with Barcelona (under the Spanish Crown) at the time. From there it spread via the trade routes like the bubonic plague did in the 14th century from Genoa. Columbus' expedition sailed from Seville, but that city was something of an 'outport' compared to Barcelona. I believe it was where routes north to Barcelona, west to the Atlantic and east to North Africa branched.   There is a parallel for sure.   The general consensus is that syphilis came from the New World. The alternative hypothesis is that it developed from the tropical disease 'Yaws'. The first theory is the most accepted one. As for the Chinese they were in at least indirect contact with Europe for a long time before the 15th century. The Black Death, after all, did originate on the Mongolian steppes.   Yes, telling the future from innards is sometimes hard to *stomach*.   My first guess would be changes in diet, but why would that have more of an effect on males ? Estrogen mimics should theoretically cause an increase in a large number of different cancers. It's a puzzle to me.    Don't both sides already know who wins ?   Competition to tea leave fortune-telling I guess.   This is a pretty common response of municipal authorities whenever a big event, usually a sporting one, takes place in a city. The sweep, of course, can't by its very nature reduce the overall number of street people by one single person. It merely displaces the 'problem' to another location.    My mistake. It's been corrected. My keyboard sometimes misses the "w"s, and it did in this case in the **W**ikipedia part of the link.   I don't think so. As I read the article it seems to be promoting some sort of updated philosophical idealism in that the only reality is that created in the observer's mind. I disagree with this point of view, but when discussing it we leave the realm of physics and enter metaphysics.   There is a [Wikipedia article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pangaea_Ultima) that has links to various pictorial representations of speculations about future continents.   No problem. What's "SMH" ?   Just to clear up your misconception. I have **never** invited a single person to become a moderator at any time whatsoever. You can verify this by looking through the modmail.   This seems very much like any other time bank. What would you say makes a difference here ?   Le Guin is one of a very few sci-fi/fantasy writers who are open about their anarchist beliefs. Michael Moorcock is another. I'm sure others could add to this list.   I like the fact that the building they have repurposed used to be a prison, one that was used for many years by the Franco regime nonetheless.    Possible target for cancer therapy I'd presume.   Glad to see it. I wish you well.   Very interesting, and I hope to comment further. In any case thanks for reminding me about the digitalization project at the IISH. I read about it awhile ago, but it slipped my memory. Gotta have another look at that.   The problem is that the legal status of corporations usually shields the management from legal action. That being said there *have* been examples of individual executives and managers being sued. It's a complicated point of law. I do agree with your statement that the individuals should be charged. It's just that I am uncertain if they *can* be.   Good question. I've seen some reconstruction of dinosaur sounds, both terrestrial and aquatic, from studies of their nasal passages, but none that have been very specific.   Let's call it an example of 'The Joy of Title Cooking'. When presenting research news to the general public the whole culture of journalism and its markets pushes people towards the 'grabby' title. I read your link to NPR, and after you got past the title it wasn't that bad.    Yes, that's possible, but the nature of chaotic motion is such that nobody could predict it. Unless some craft was observing at the time probably all that we would see is 'moons at time zero' and 'no moons (or one) at time zero plus x'.    No, but you could at least invite him out for a few beers.   That's true isn't it. I can't cite chapter and verse, but I do recall that this sort of thing has been mentioned in terms of the possibility of life in multi-star systems. The multi-body problem strikes again.   Yes it was meant for you, even though you weren't the first accuser. If you weren't merely trying to clarify the original accusation then claiming that "they do not apply their supposed values to their on lives" is more than an allusion to purity. It is a direct implication/statement that the person who wants the amplifiers isn't "pure" because he wants said consumer good. If you say he is "hypocritical" you are applying a standard of judgement that judges his "purity" in relation to either his views, the views you think he holds or perhaps the views you *think* he should hold.  I don't know how many thousands (perhaps tens of thousands) of times I have heard similar accusations of hypocrisy/impurity leveled by leftists over the decades. Sometimes it sticks to the target. Usually it doesn't. It hardly ever sticks in the case of consumer goods. The *only* way it could be properly defined as hypocrisy would be if the target *consistently* demanded some renunciation of consumer goods from others. In such a case he would be "hypocritical" because he was impure himself.  In actuality it makes no difference whatsoever to the wider world if the target gets his amplifiers or not. His act of 'impurity/immorality' has no demonstrable physical consequence. If he doesn't buy the amplifiers someone else will. End of story. The only standard of judgement is about his personal character/purity. *That* is judgement of his purity or lack thereof. If he was doing something that had a real physical effect, such as being a boss then the accusation would have had a base in reality.  Once more, if you were merely explaining the original accusation I stand corrected. If you were supporting it then see above...   I think you have a point in that.   Well, if you wish to get into arguments about purity I've got a good analogy. The Jain religion takes 'non-harm' to its ultimate point. If you wish to be a *truly* pure Jain you end up starving yourself to death out of a reluctance to do any harm to any other living being. People can't live on salt alone. Out of millions of Jains at any one time there are only a few dozen going this route in India. It's basically unheard of in the diaspora. The greatest and most obvious reason why Jainism still exists is simply that at all times and places 99.9999% of the population will *always* choose to be 'impure'. Seems to me they make the sensible choice.   Yes. I perhaps date myself by saying that the electronic format is annoying enough to me that I *never* read a book that way - only in print. I'll read articles on the internet but not a book.   I believe that the efforts to make $15/hour the minimum apply to all low wage workers. It's just that people working in fast food make up such a large proportion of such people.   Yes, failure of the monsoons is amongst the possibilities of climate change, and its effects would be even more disastrous. To my knowledge climate change also had a big role in human evolution at the western end of the Indian Ocean.   Thanks for the info.   No doubt the writers take information through a 'supply chain' that begins with the military and their contractors and is thus 'optimistic'. I'm afraid I can't comment on the possibility you raise, but it is a caution worthy of mention.   That's true. It's like 'loading the dice' or 'fixing the wheel' in gambling.    If it did it would have been a great thing to do DNA analysis on.   Not really. It's long been a matter of dispute.   Fimbrae and adhesins are basically the same thing ie structures that bind the prokaryotic cell to surfaces such as an eukaryotic cell. The difference between the classical view of binding via fimbrae and the results described in the original paper is that the authors have uncovered a mechanism that leads to much firmer binding via a covalent bond to proteins on the cell surface. This is via thioester moieties.   You can find the [original paper](http://elifesciences.org/content/4/e06638) at the online journal Elife, and the full explanation is there.   In order for a place name to be transmitted to newcomers there would have to be people on hand to tell the new people the name. I wonder if there is any documentary evidence of the Vikings finding people already there when they landed in Iceland. There is certainly writings about aboriginal people in regards to both Greenland Vinland.    Rent control is a local or state matter, not a national one. The other thing is that there is not a single example of rent *reduction* via such laws/regulation. They only slow down the rate of increase.   Given what I read of the early history the people who first formed PS had been active before Occupy, perhaps for years. Perhaps Occupy galvanized them by both a sense of possibility but also a demonstration of the failure of political movements that lack a program and a structure.   I don't know if it that apathetic. It probably depends on what community you live in. The prairies, however, were once one of the 'hot spots' of radicalism in Canada, but yes, it has been declining for decades.   I assume that they are taking this from the idea that subcutaneous fat was needed for insulation in the water. The 'aquatic ape' hypothesis has few followers today. If you think this is bad have a look at some of the other comments.   Yes that would be better. I used the original title from Nature. In the context of this paper the authors are using primary production - the total biomass produced - as an estimate for the removal of CO2 from the atmosphere. The problem on reddit is that you can only edit text posts and comments, not titles. Otherwise I'd go with your suggestion.   Well, I suppose we could have a long conversation about doing something that is not only possible but actually being done as we speak, instead of living in resentment and doing nothing. We could also have a conversation about the pluses and minuses of 'worker1vote', and how I personally don't consider it the best model. *However* before any such thing I have to ask a question.......  *How on Earth do you think that a link to the **Freelancers' Union** and its Board of Directors where one of the Directors has a connection to Goldman Sachs has **anything whatsoever** to do with the pluses or minuses of a totally different organization ie the one in the article* ? ??? One can make many criticisms of both the USW and Mondragon, but dragging in a totally different union is not amongst the arguments.   Thanks. I found my mistake. The last numbers in the address are '34435' not '3445'. Sherlock Holmes and the case of the missing '4'.   There is a more detailed [article](http://www.alasbarricadas.org/noticias/node/3435) in Spanish at the site of the Spanish anarchist magazine A Las Barricadas.   Here's a few. I'll hopefully be adding others later.  Toronto: June 17: [Downtown East Women Reclaim the Streets](http://ocap.ca/node/1234)  Barcelona: June 25-28 [11 Mostra Del Llibre Anarquista](http://www.libreanarquista.net)  Victoria BC: Sept 2 [Victoria Anarchist Bookfair](http://www.victoriaanarchistbookfair.ca)  London England: Oct. 24 [London A Bookfair](http://anarchistbookfair.org.uk)   The trouble with the actions is that they aren't merely restricted to this particular company. There is a lot of other 'greenwashing' that happens. No doubt Norwegians should demand investment in renewable energy - which will probably be mostly hydro given the nature of the country, perhaps wind. The oil won't last forever.   Yes, "strive in vain" is a better translation. I've changed it in the body of the post. Thanks. I was puzzled by that last line.   I wish the Black Rose Federation well, but I am very doubtful about their success. Hopefully I am wrong. North America is a particularly 'unhealthy' environment for such an organization given the prominence of other 'points of view' amongst anarchists there. I was never a member, but I can remember saying back in 1980 exactly the same thing you say now; "it isn't time yet".  There have been other efforts since then, all of them eventually transient. NEFAC as a good effort, but it had its failings. Prior to that 'Love and Rage' went some distance, but its internal politics were basically - horrifying. I can remember reading the first edition of their paper, and the thought came into my mind; "What is this Maoist bullshit"; best I keep my distance from this crew." Of course not all of their efforts were Maoist influenced, but you simply can't have Maoists and sane people in the same organization.  Outside of the USA I'm fairly confident that there are no other Anglophone countries with the 'partial' exceptions of Ireland and the UK that are 'ready' in any sense. I think that the situation is different in other countries, but I might be wrong on this. It's easy to get a blurred picture from afar.   To speak to the question rather than other comments:  As time goes by in the 'anarcho-waiting room' if you have an open and critical mind you find yourself less and less able to accurately describe your anarchism with *one* particular label. All you can do is list the schools of thought that have influenced you rather than define you. For myself the main items are pretty typical: syndicalism, mutualism (in its socialist varieties) and to a lesser extent anarchocommunism (in the sense of community politics) and individualism (in its less dogmatic and rhetorical form). Above all I'm a gradualist. People who have influenced me in that direction include Proudhon (most of the time), Pi y Margall, Colin Ward, Joan Piero, Paul Goodman and a few others. Also many people who don't carry the @ label such as Jane Jacobs, Ivan Illich, Maurice Brinton and a few libertarian Marxists.   I really think that the high cost of living in the Vancouver area might just be due a itsy, bitsy, tiny bit to the real estate market which is something of a bubble.   Thanks. I just saw it way down at the bottom. Looks like I neglected to add the name to the post. Never saw that site before. I'm going to have to add it to my list.   In terms of simple economics the matter of minimum wages is not as clear cut as some conservative ideologues would like to make out. In terms of its connection with employment/unemployment levels I've argued the subject multiple time. In normal circumstances it has **no** effect on unemployment levels.  In this case, in the matter of services provided to the government of the City of Vancouver by private contractors (most of the actual government employees are covered by union contracts that guarantee them far more than the amount mentioned), it will most likely have absolutely no effect whatsoever on competitive advantage. The government simply doesn't contract out across borders to any appreciable extent and neither does it 'sell' to the outside. It's a local market that stops a few miles out of city limits. In terms of the local economy the effect would be stimulatory, increasing the funds in circulation.   I'm afraid I don't. I'll see if I can find it on the internet, but I doubt that it's available. Possibilities = 1)it was influenced by said book, 2) Berthier is a member of said group, 3)it was written by someone heavily influenced by the book, up to the point of paraphrase or 4) it's actually a crib from said book without attribution (shame, shame). I'll see what I can find out.  Part 4, the conclusion and my own thoughts, will follow soon.   There have been other attempts at unionization of bike couriers in various cities. I'm afraid that I am not current enough on the subject to say if any of them "stuck".   I'd imagine that they would be. Earth-based 'cloaking' is already well advanced. My first thought would be that they would establish a small nearby observation post (Mars, the Moon ?) from which they could keep track of things without being detected. If you were to believe 'flying saucer' stories then you have to assume that technological advance doesn't go hand in hand with caution and common sense. Or another hypothesis - they are galactic teases. Of course we shouldn't necessarily assume the usual human motivations to extraterrestrial life. Who knows.   I wonder ho you say "slumming" in Antarrese ?   No, you're right. It is a possibility.    Sort of "why *didn't* the chicken cross the road" ?   From an extraterrestrial point of view Earth may be "a nice place to visit, but nobody would want to live there". In any case it's pretty obvious that Earthlings aren't popular as dinner guests. Bad manners. Bad manners.   I hate to say it, but that went through my mind as well. I assume 'adult diapers'. The main brand that I am familiar with is called `Depends, but I`m sure there are others.   Thanks. It skipped my mind that when I cross post an article the links don't travel with it and I have to insert them again in the new texts. Good catch.   Neat. Thanks very much.   Communities of true believers are the same whatever the subject of the true belief is. As examples there are certainly more ex-Trotskyists at any given time than there are actual Trotskyists. As for true believing Marxist Leninists of a non-Trotskyist character well, all that I can say is that it will take a few decades before all the exes die off and the few hundreds of ignorant youngsters could outnumber the 'formers'. There are religious sects like that as well. The Jehovahs are the great example.  No doubt even anarchism sheds adherents over time, and this is nothing new. All that I can say to that is rather than going down the old 'rejection road' it is perhaps better to seek out a *better* anarchism to replace the childish one first adopted. Unlike religious or political cults there is no inherent barrier to such maturation.   I suppose you might find such claims in Bolshevik and later USSR propaganda at the time. You won't, however, find them verified in any reliable academic source if for no other reason than aside from two rather outr circumstances it would be physically impossible. I'll tell you why.  Let's begin by granting, for the sake of argument, that the anarchist groups were bloodthirsty thugs who would be more than happy to commit such atrocities if they could. If you believe a lot of the history written by Mennonites who emigrated to the West every single side (there were many) in the Civil War, except for them, of course, were barbaric, but the Makhnovists were the worst of the lot. Leave that situation aside because the Mennonites were as far from being Bolshevik sympathizers as it is possible to be. Let's situate the whole question.  First of all the anarchists. They were far less influential than anarchists often like to pretend. Aside from the Makhnovist army there were literally *no* other anarchist armed forces worth noting anywhere in Russia during the course of the Civil War. As to Kronstadt it should be noted that the anarchists were not a major force in that insurrection as well. In the last election held for the Kronstadt Soviet before the rebellion the anarchists gained all of 5% of the votes. The most influential political force amongst the sailors was probably the SR-Maximalists, a trend that some have described as being' half way between the Socialist Revolutionaries and the anarchists. In terms of sheer numbers the largest group of rebels was comprised of members of the Bolshevik Party who had left it in disgust in the years up to 1921. The *only* leader that historians label as 'anarchist, 'Stefan Petrichenko' was just such a person, and his career both before and after Kronstadt was 'checkered' to say the least.  Now, more importantly, there is the matter of the Bolsheviks and the peasantry. In 1917 the peasants comprised about 100 million people, 80% of the population. In December 1917, two months after the Revolution, the Bolshevik Party had the 'enormous' amount of members of peasant origin of 4,122. This was actually an improvement. In 1916 the Party had a total of *four* rural cells amongst this population of 100 million. At the Sixth part Congress in July/August 1917 there were **NO** peasant delegates. The first figure means that for every card carrying communist that they wanted to kill the 'anarchists' would have had to do in about 25,000 ordinary people if they operated purely on chance selection.  The Bolsheviks, of course, recognized their massive weakness in rural areas, and they made great efforts to recruit amongst the peasantry. By 1921 the Communist Party had grown rapidly to about 700,000 members. Too rapid for some. It was time for a purge. At that time there were about 197,000 'peasant' members, about 0.2% of the rural population. The Party purged about 98,500 of them. Even though the purge was partially directed at the left opposition within the Party its major rationale was to get rid of 'careerists' ie those who joined for monetary reasons. Keep this in mind. It will be important in untangling the claim of 'anarchist massacres of communist peasants'. In any case I'm sure that this would make the anarchists' murderous task much easier. Now they would only have had to go through a thousand peasants to get a commie as opposed to 25,000.  The purge had its rationale. The 'peasant' Bolsheviks were an interesting lot. Understand what the Bolsheviks were doing in the years of 'War Communism'. Basically they would send out detachments from the cities into the countryside for two purposes. One was to steal grain, so-called 'requisitions'. The other was to forcibly conscript peasants into the Red Army. When they were available they would send out workers with some sort of connection to the village in question, but such were rarely available. The detachments were basically looting expeditions and kidnapping squads. Once in a village they would try to enlist local collaborators who, of course, became members of the Communist Party. The character of these collaborators, *some* of whom were purged in 1921, is best described by the following from Samuel Farber's 'Before Stalinism: The Rise and Fall of Soviet Democracy';  Thus, among the new post-revolutionary rural Communists were to be found priests, former Tsarist policemen and government employees interested in advancing their careers.  Aside from the weakness of the anarchists another thing should be understood, the strength of the traditional party of the peasantry, the Socialist Revolutionaries. If one were to enumerate support for this incredibly disorganized and ineffective party its supporters would have vastly outnumbered those of the Bolsheviks even at the height of the latter's popularity. Besides being fractured, however, the SRs had other millstones around their necks. One was simple confusion about what they wanted. The SRs were long on good sounding rhetoric and short on practicality. Long on high sounding principles and short on details. The left SRs, who were in coalition with the Bolsheviks in the early months after October also carried a romantic attachment to terrorist tactics - totally useless in a civil war.  At the beginning of the revolution the peasants had a certain ill-informed sympathy for the Bolsheviks whom Lenin dragged kicking and screaming into a defeatist position and in  support of the peasant land expropriations which were generally taking place without the influence of *any* political party. He also convinced the Party to add the simplistic slogan of 'Bread' to those of 'Peace' and 'Land'. In the end the Bolsheviks delivered peace, stood aside in the face of the fact of land seizures and drew the country into a situation where the 'Bread' of 1917 looked like paradise in comparison to the famines during their fight for power, some of which was due to their theft of grain.  During the course of the Civil War the Bolsheviks faced peasant rebellions that literally numbered in the **hundreds**. I emphasize that. Hundreds ! Many more of these such as the Tambov Rebellion were inspired by the SRs as compared to the limited number inspired by anarchists. Even so the great majority were inspired by the natural resistance of people to thieves and kidnappers. It didn't require a political party for people to rise up against exploiters such as the Bolsheviks. The Bolshevik advantage was that these natural rebellions were almost always local and lacked coordination. There was also a great animosity between the right and left wings of the SRs. The former were willing to collaborate with the Whites; for the latter it was totally out of the question.  In the end the Bolsheviks won more because of the disorganization and outright stupidity of their opponents. Of the various White commanders only Wrangel was willing to make a small number of concessions to popular feelings, and these were indeed minor. Commanders like Kolchak, Kornilov, Yudenich or Denikin carried out a brutal campaign of slaughter and repression in whatever territories they controlled. As for the anarchists besides being minor players outside of eastern Ukraine they had other problems. If you like I could enumerate them. I'm an anarchist myself, but I'm a greater believer in truth. A lot of anarchists engage in wishful thinking in regards to Russia and the anarchist role in the revolution.  So to conclude this incredibly long reply there were simple reasons that the anarchists didn't 'murder Bolshevik peasants'. One is that, outside of eastern Ukraine there simply weren't enough anarchists to do any such thing. A large number of Russian anarchists who were anarchosyndicalists were just as much an urban phenomena as the Bolsheviks. The other reason is that the beast known as 'Communist peasants' basically didn't exist. There were detachments sent out from the cities to steal and kidnap. There were also small numbers of local collaborators who were usually not peasants at all. I am fairly confident in saying that there was not a *single* village in all of Russia where the majority were Bolshevik supporters by the time the spring of 1918 rolled along.  One more thing. Anarchists and more frequently SRs did indeed kill the occasional 'Bolshevik peasant' by accident when they killed other peasants. Amongst the anarchists there were those mentally ill 'individualists' who believed in individual acts of terror. When they attacked the general population with bombs or in robberies they may have killed a rare Bolshevik peasant by accident. These incidents were mercifully rare. Much more significant were those peasants forcibly conscripted into the Red Army as it deployed to fight the anarchists, SRs or ordinary peasants. A small number of those would have been Bolshevik sympathizers, but even though they outnumbered the innocent victims of idiotic terrorism they were still uncommon. These were the two 'outr circumstances' that I mentioned at the beginning.    Not to my knowledge. What specific question do you think might be answered by such research ? I'd think that the general profile of isolated communities would show an increased level of relatedness. Other than that perhaps it might be useful in comparative studies of the general Swedish population.   Tons upon tons. All that I can do is French and Spanish, but there is a great ocean out there of items in such languages as Italian, Portuguese, German, Russian, etc.. I've been a long time admirer of your work. I particularly found your piece on Flora Tristan valuable. Please feel free to post items here at your convenience. Forgotten Anarchism is specifically targeted to translations of women anarchists of which you have done many. Have you done any of my favourite, Isidine/Korn/Goldsmith/Goldschmidt ? It's well looking into. She was the main force amongst Russian exiles in France in the late 19th/early 20th century. She was also Kropotkin's most frequent correspondent and translated his 'Ethics' into French from the Russian. Also a book by the Russian SR Lavrov. Makhno's secretary for awhile. It goes on and on. In terms of disputes she had the ability to find a middle position on pretty well any issue - which didn't endear her to many. Everybody on both sides would assume she was supporting the other side.  I was browsing through La Frondeuse from your link, and I found something you might not be aware of. Most of the links are working, but those that link to 'previous issues' of La Frondeuse end up as 'page not found'. Have a look at it if you have time.  Take care. B.   Oh my God. The aliens have taken over Sesame Street too. Tell me it ain't so.   A lot of people did, and the aggressive anti-gay foul-mouthed pair were properly shamed. It's always good to see the benevolence in ordinary people.   Aliens eat cats ?   Thanks for the info.   It doesn't seem to be a problem for me. In any case...  ""*WASHINGTON (The Borowitz Report)  Calling the Obama Administrations actions against the soccer organization weak and ineffective, Senator John McCain on Thursday proposed military action to dismantle and destroy FIFA once and for all.  These are people who only understand one thing: force, McCain said on the floor of the United States Senate. We must make FIFA taste the vengeful might and fury of the United States military.  McCain said that he was completely unimpressed by the Department of Justices arrests of several top FIFA lieutenants this week, calling the action the kind of Band-Aid solution that this Administration, sadly, has become famous for.  Rounding up a few flunkies in a hotel is meaningless when the leader of FIFA remains at large, he said. I will follow Sepp Blatter to the gates of Hell.  McCain requested a four-billion-dollar aid package for moderate elements within global soccer, and said that the United States should be prepared to put boots on the ground in Switzerland.

I found what you were talking about in a comment to the original article at Nordic Science. It wasn't me, by the way. It's strange if for no other reason than it is totally disconnected with the subject of the article. Oh well.   I wonder how the two languages compare. Also Faroese. I always thought that Icelandic was the closest to Old Norse.   Thanks for the link. It's very informative.    Welcome. I guess the first sentence refers to a post at r/communismworldwide. The first post doesn't seem to be here. Feel free to post that as well. I wasn't aware that there was such a thing as post-scarcity *Marxism*. I've definitely seen it *hinted* at over the years but not stated bluntly.  I think it is a mistake for anarchists to assume that their will be one and only one economic system in the future. Various methods of distribution and of production each have their benefits and drawbacks. I think that experimentation is and would be the order of the day. The only restrictions on this would be that central planning by a state or a *completely free market that allowed or encouraged monopoly would not be worth striving for.   In any case I think that a mixed economy would be the best and perhaps the *only* system that would be efficient, democratic, liberating for the individual, ecologically and socially stable and perhaps even *possible*. A totally open, moneyless system of distribution in which all goods and services would be open to all takers, essentially complete anarchocommunism which 'post-scarcity' says is possible is neither desirable nor possible. Let's deal with the possible part first.  Personally I think that it is an essential part of anarchism, as it should be for any socialism, that the basic necessities of life are provided to all people, regardless of their position in a system of production. Everyone should have housing, food, clothing, opportunity for personal development, mobility within reason, electricity, running water, sewage and garbage service, etc., etc., etc.. All of these are such that they *should* be distributed free which is in  fact anarchocommunism in practice if not in the sense of a complete system.  There are, however, things for which there is a **natural** scarcity. Everybody should have shoes, but personally designed ones are, of necessity, scarce. Everyone should have mobility, but not everyone in the whole world who *wants* to go to Venice should arrive there all at once. It's basically elbow room only at certain times of the year as it is when it costs money. Not everyone can have an original Picasso hanging on the wall. Everyone should have decent clothing, but if the idea of 'fashion' persists in a freer society I can't see either the need nor the possibility of this being provided free. Everyone should have decent food, but the desire for gourmet cooking with exotic ingredients can't be satisfied for a whole society at no cost. Everyone should have decent housing, but not everyone who wants to live in a palace can be satisfied. The list goes on and on.  My own viewpoint is that a basic decent life should always be available free of charge, but that a secondary exchange economy, a market if you will, should run in parallel for those goods and services that are simply *not* infinite. I differ from left libertarians like most American mutualists in that I would see more of the economy socialized than they would because I don't have the faith in some market that they do.  There are other arguments against a totally socialized economy, but I will restrict myself to natural scarcity for now. Your opinion is that food is one of the items which are naturally scarce. This is at least *partially* true, but it's a complicated matter that I'll try and speak to later.  By the way, thank you for the post. This is the sort of rational dialogue that I'd like there to be more of.  You raise a number of issues, but I'll speak to only one for now. Others later   Thank you. You're probably right. The 'Elf' just struck me as amusing. As to the picture, however, you must admit that it is damn hard to get a picture of a real elf. Camera-shy big time.  What struck me about your post was something else; 'dalen' as valley. English still has at least one word derived from the same root ie "dale" which is another name for valley. Admittedly it isn't used much these days. Out of sheer curiosity I'm going to try and find any English words other than 'elf' that derive from Old Norse, Old Germanic, etc..   I hope the lesson took on them.   I don't believe so.   The side bar definition seems fairly reasonable to me. If it was up to me I'd expand it (the side bar) a bit in terms of 'democratic decision making' at the base of such a society, in both the workplace and the community. I'd also expand it in terms of the federalism that is necessary to run such a society ie the institutional cooperation between workplaces and communities, both local and distant. Sort of adding the 'fraternit' to the .egalit'.   The last is indeed the big question. The planned mission will, at best, find evidence for a "possibility" for life not any proof.   Quite connected to 'Bakunin against insurrectionism'   You are certainly right. The article referenced has the 'give-away' term 'some' in the body of the article itself.   Thanks for the clarification.   I remember a few years ago when there was a big copyright fight, and one archive (I believe it was the Marxists.org archive) had to remove some of their material. I see that this is being posted from Mexico, and copyright might be different there.  In any case there's a problem in the presentation. If you enlarge the text so that it is readable you find that it is often 'seeing double'. Somehow, someway the process of uploading messed up. The result isn't unreadable, but it is difficult.   It depends upon what you call a "human" fossil. As for Homo sapiens the time is much shorter, 200,000 yrs BP. You are probably speaking of the origin of the genus Homo which has been dated from 1.9 mil to 2.5 mil yrs BP. The line of descent, however, goes much further back but 30 mil yrs ago there was nothing that could remotely be called human. The genus Hominoidea dates to about 25 mil yrs BP.  I don't think that the appearance of the genus Homo is any more significant than any of the other branching points. There is ongoing work on the paleoecology in east/south Africa that may have had an effect on human evolution. Climate seems to have a lot to do with the evolution of humans.  Thanks for the comment by the way. It was thought provoking.   Yes, it would, but loss of muscle tone during development would probably imply more serious problems that would make the embryo unviable in any case.   Cross post from r/worldanarchism.   This post reminded me of a website that I haven't heard from for some time. Finally it clicked in memory. It's called [Forgotten Anarchism](http://forgottenanarchism.wordpress.com). It a regular collection project that posts translations by anarchist women writers of the past, and it's quite interesting. The originals are so far in French, Spanish and Portuguese.    Yes, but said monopoly may not be an eternal thing.   One of the 'bads' is that sometimes recycling is not.... Cities have set up recycling systems and ended up taking the trash collected to the dump anyways. Not that this is very common, but it does happen.   Some of the article certainly assumed a familiarity with a lot of anatomical terms that might be difficult. I wonder if you might be looking for some sort of introductory material, and perhaps I could help.   Thank you. Interesting.   I remember reading this a few months ago and thinking it was a very good article. Looks like I'm going to reread it. If people follow the Spanish or French @s unions you'll see that they are quite active outside of the workplace. Even non-@ unions like the Longshoremen go outside the traditional bounds that more conservative unions stick to. It's something that should be a lot more frequent.   Not really on the subject matter of the post, but I've never seen "locked down" used in this way.   Sort of like a "pre-obit" ?   The  'blank slate' is an ideological position that is held by a small number of academics in certain disciplines, and, like you say, it is rare. On the other hand the 'nativist' position as you call it is equally rare, rare to the point of non-existent as a matter of fact. The idea that *all* human behavior is genetically determined only exists in the imagination of those who propagandize against this made-up 'enemy'. In the world of academia the whole question was settled over 25 years ago, and nowadays evolutionary psychology is a very vast and productive field in which people of very different social and political views work. The question has been settled.  Having a certain acquaintance with 'learning theory' it is obvious that the adherents of 'behaviorism' accept a biological basis. You can't do science without it. At the same time, however, those who favor a more 'nativist' approach also understand the importance of 'learning'. The whole matter is not an either/or one.  As to Skinner it has been a longer time than 25 years since I have read anything by him. I presume he has been dead for some time. I won't try and pontificate on his morality. What I will say is that the view that human emotions and opinions are infinitely malleable is a view that would-be social engineers find very comforting whether they be of left or right wing persuasions. The idea of a 'human nature' that can't be 'conditioned away' should be at the base of any left wing point of view. The views of Stalin are the same as those of Hitler on this matter.   Like I said, I won't try and judge Skinner's morality even if I found his 'Walden Two' quite unpleasant about 40 years ago. Very few great evils in this world have been committed by people who didn't think they were doing good.    I gather you don't like his ideas. I don't agree with all of them myself, but what do you disagree with ?   As for 'marriages', at my age after a lifetime of avoiding events that require that I dress up I am at the situation where I avoid funerals more than I avoid marriages. Mercifully most of my grandnephews and grandnieces have already crossed that threshold. As for the grandchildren it's unfortunately coming up. Ick !  It's nice to be able to take a long view. As I recall the attitude towards gay people has certainly varied from time to time as you mention. This has generally gone along with a general societal view of sex in general.  Here's the important point that I guess I will have to repeat. I have only a bit of doubt that a 'bourgeois' world would have a bit of difficulty in accommodating something like gay marriage. In our present world which I chose to call 'managerial' there is no such economic barrier. In fact the general  'meritocratic' cast of the economy argues 'for' it rather than against it. We live in a different economy than that of the 1930s, let alone the Victorian Age where a view such as yours would be more accurate.  Yes, the misnamed 'bourgeois world' "approves" of it in your terms. What I would say is that people should accept this and approve of it. It's an advance towards general equality, and whether gay relationships are "boring and absurd" is irrelevant at this time in history. It's what many/most gay people want, and it is an advance that non-gay people will agree to . Not every single thing that happens in society has to be viewed in a lens of 'not enough'.   You may indeed criticize a society on the basis of 'property relations' in marriage, but this criticism becomes less and less relevant in a society that is increasingly 'single' and in which property rights are increasingly differentiated in the legal institution of marriage. This is no longer 1890.   Did anyone ever take a survey on the political views of gay people rather than extrapolating from news reports and personal acquaintance ? I am *sure* that the gay community is pretty much the same as the straight community with a moderate shift to 'the left'. That shift would be expected from life experiences, but it is a mistake in my opinion to equate being gay with being 'radical'. I'm old enough to remember Stonewall if not the Mattachine Society and the Daughters of Bilitis that preceded them. Very 'bourgeois' them.  Here's the trick. Something like sexual orientation is **not** a direct path to any sort of radical political or economic views. That doesn't mean that advances in the public position of gay people are not 'progressive' as it's called. It still is most definitely so. A managerial society such as ours *can* accommodate a position of equality, and it definitely *should*.  Any proper socialist should support initiatives to free gay people from discrimination/restrictions. That's part of socialism. On the other hand socialists shouldn't entertain illusions that things that can legitimately be granted under managerial society and are in the end to the benefit of such a society are some sort of inherent 'contradiction' as Marxists would say. They aren't, and I could cite Marx on the so-called 'progressive' nature of capitalism as an example of the way I view things.  The criticism of marriage that you mention was quite prominent '40 years ago'. Since then it has diminished considerably. It was a different time. You think this is unfortunate. Personally I have no opinion on whether it is good or bad. It just **is**. I take a longer view. In the absence of any great change I'll take the small changes that are possible at a given time as they come.   It's poking fun at a certain trend in American politics (and pretty well nowhere else in the world today) where the message of the NT is distorted in the service of certain current political views.   All contemporary rhetoric aside socialism has always held the concept of 'equality' as a good. Thus any legislation that automatically denies some people a 'social good' while granting it to others is against the principles of socialism. This hasn't always been recognized in all places at all times, but it is an inevitable logical conclusion. Thus, it is relevant to socialism in the same way that restrictions on this or that ethnic group are. Suppose you were a socialist who for whatever reason thought that a gay orientation was 'immoral'. Even if you held that position you would still have to accept the recognition of gay marriage if you wished to still consider yourself 'socialist'.   This relates to another contemporary question, that of abortion. Shall we say you are a 'member' (not an accurate description - 'believer' would be better) of the 'Catholic Left'. As such you will usually oppose abortion, but, for the sake of consistency, you will *not* seek legal prohibitions on it, but will rather argue against it in a free forum of ideas. People on the 'Catholic Left' are usually socialist in one way or another, and they resolve the contradiction in this way.   Thank you for the reference. I haven't read the paper before, but a quick skim says that it's a valuable source. The hypothesis predates 1999 (the date of the paper), but this seems like a good review in reference to Homo erectus. Once more thanks.   "Who would Jesus bomb ?" Or maybe picture the Holy Spirit as a drone ?   I have no doubt they are "speaking" in their new jobs. They are also "walking" to the meetings with their friends, "writing or emailing" their friends, influencing other to do favors and so on and so forth. Let them do it, but let them not get paid for it. That's the difference. You can say that Caesar should be killed in the streets of Rome, but that's different from supplying the daggers.   Not really. It is, of course, a "change in life history" **but** the *potential* for such a change could easily be a "spandrel". I'll present a simple example. Suppose we take the prevalence of genes such as BRCA1 and BRCA2. I would presume that there would be selection against such genes, and I would presume that the selection pressure would be stronger in past times when breast cancer was a death sentence. OK, that's the original "selection". Said selection would operate even in the conditions where a human ancestor was more likely to die "before old age" due to things like falls and Saber-Tooth tigers *because* even young women get breast cancer albeit at a lower rate than old women.  Now fast forward to today (or the last 100 years in *part* of the world). Even though women have less chance of dying young from all the Sabertooths wandering around the selection pressure still exists even if it is diminished. Older women have a *higher* chance of getting breast cancer than younger ones do. Relieve the "cut-off" of early death and the effect of selection against BRCA 1 and 2 doesn't just remain - the effect of its removal is **magnified** in demographic surveys because more older women live through breast cancer of which they have a higher incidence.  This is a classic incidence of a 'spandrel'. The selection is *not* for anything like increased lifespan after fertility. It is an example of where selection for one thing has unexpected events in a difference situation. The selection was *not* for the longevity that wasn't a usual situation 'back then'. It was for something quite different, but it has benefit in a new situation. This means it is....a spandrel.   Give him a break. Who do you think he is - God ?   Well, they're definitely not "turning the other cheek" except that of the victim to double-slap them. I've read the Bible, but it's been quite a few years. All the same I find it quite amazing how ignorant some believers are about the book they claim to follow.  With my old person's memory I am pretty sure that I have forgotten much more than they have ever learned, and I still know much more than they ever will.   The 'New Alabama Version^TM' I presume.   I checked. The part that you heard was when they were talking about Sainte-Marie's being blacklisted, not about government actions against native nations in general. Ste.-Marie lays the blame for the actions against her on *individuals* rather than any written government policy in any inter-office memo. What she is saying is true in a strictly legal sense. It also fits in very well with her general point of view that individuals are much more important than institutions. It's the way she views the world.  I also was reminded of the title of the song 'These Ones' that was in my mind. It's 'Now that the buffalos gone'. Going over the article carefully also brought another thing to light. I can remember Ste.-Marie on Sesame Street, but I never realized how long it has been since she moved to Hawaii. It registered today that it's been over 30 years. Hum.   Yes, but I think that the idea is that such individuals were 'helpers', and more children of theirs and their relatives 'survived'.   Thanks for the link.   That doesn't sound like Sainte-Marie, but there may be a certain subtle context here. In some of her songs she presents the listener with a challenge. Two pop into my mind. Excuse me, I am bad with song titles. I tend to remember them via 'key phrases'  rather than printed title. I'm thinking of 'Soldier Blue' and 'These Ones'. In both cases she mentions 'the government', of course, but she also challenges non-native people to oppose the actions of said government. The *emphasis* is not on the evil actions of the state but rather on the moral *obligation* to take a stand against the actions.  I'll check the transcript to see if this possibility is correct.   I believe that Stephan J. Gould would have called such unintended consequences 'spandrels' as in his essay taking the metaphor of St. Mark's in Venice. Quite frankly I'm agnostic about an adaptive explanation in this case as I believe the paper's author was.   If reproduction happened towards the end of an animal's life and the progeny would die without maternal care there would be no selective pressure for such late reproduction to persist. I think the author is talking about reproduction that is not "on the edge of the grave". It seems that there would be a 'balance' of selective pressures. As the article discusses animals in captivity show post-reproduction longevity that isn't evident in the wild. This implies that the 'risks of life' are such that such a balance exists under natural conditions, and that the scenario you discuss is a very unlikely one.   The journal 'Trends in Ecology and Evolution' is published by Cell Press, a branch of Elsevier. Yes, it is a reputable journal. I don't know if I understand your first point correctly, but it seems you are criticizing what is actually the common usage in these sort of papers. People routinely say that a certain trait is selected "for" or "against", and their statements contain the *implied* name of a trait that is the *opposite* of the trait they are speaking of. I know you are probably implying that a 'selectionist' argument for the origin of post-reproduction longevity doesn't necessarily follow from its contradiction of the expectation quoted above.  Now that's true, and the article in fact discusses this along with a number of other open questions surrounding the phenomena of this longevity. It's a *review* article not a report of results from original investigation, and as such it is open ended. It doesn't advance any firm answers. The point you raise is discussed in the context of comparisons of humans to other animals that show post-reproductive longevity *in captivity* but not *in the wild*. It's an interesting point to ponder.   That's a possibility, but it depends on what its competitors are doing at the time. How oligarchic is the industry and how much opportunity is there for collusion in such things ? Personally I don't know.   Oh shit. My mistake. I am demanding a full confession from my middle right hand finger.   He lived to 98 if I recall correctly, and he was active politically in pacifist/anti-nuclear weapon groups right up to the end. I have a mental picture stored in memory of a photo of this incredibly old guy at a demonstration.   I wouldn't call that "idiotic" at all. One of the hallmarks of scientific inquiry when it is quantitative is that it *always* admits to the possibility of error and tries to estimate the probability of such error.   You are **completely** insane.   Thank you. I read the first, but it was many years ago. I've never read the second. I have a stack of his books, and I'll look through it to see if I have it.   Really ??? If someone makes a claim the 'burden' is on those who disagree to *prove the negative* ? That's an old one. In any case **I** claim that you owe me every single penny that you have, and I'd like this debt to be paid **SOON**. The burden is, of course, on *you* to prove my claim is false. The next knock on your door will be from the repo-man.   Well, that is true. The trick is that it takes a massive amount of self-deception to convince yourself of certainty in every aspect of life. No doubt people need a certain amount of 'certainty' if for no other reason than to avoid paralysis. Yet it is impossible to have this all the time in human life. Russell says that philosophy 'trains' you to live with this. Whether this is true or not I don't know.   That seems reasonable to me. Sorry, I didn't notice the flair button. It seems pretty light on the board.   Are you sure about that ? Sorry, I had to do it.   Well that too, but as Russell might say you have to be uncertain about it.   I imagine that this isn't the only 'card-trick' that Walmart is pulling.   That's an interesting interview. One point, however, is never addressed. Nader doesn't seem to condemn Sanders' choice to run for the Democratic nomination as opposed to running as an independent. He weighs the pros and cons and refrains from making a judgement. That's fine. What is missing is the possibility/probability that *both* paths are futile in the American political system, a system that massively handicaps any challenger from outside the 'corporate consensus'. I'd be willing to say that participation in national elections is n exercise in futility. Nader doesn't seem to want to come to grips with that.   I agree. It's a very valuable mission.   Yes, that is the scenario that suggested itself to me.   Yes, but to be replaced by **what** ? Perhaps something far worse.   At the same time as some other countries are trying to get out of the nuclear industry.   Just a little thing on Zerzan. Have a quick look at his history. You'll find he's done a lot of travelling. Quite a lot ! Like many such people of his opinions he has *easily* dumped the greenhouse gas equivalent of 10 to 20 ordinary people into the atmosphere. Go outside of the USA to take your sample. In some countries the numbers would run into the hundreds. There are so many old sayings..."do as I say, not as I do", the Biblical tales of hypocrisy(motes/beams, sepulchers), "those who can do and those who can't teach", etc..   You're welcome.   The latest news on this is that the Mexican government has offered to mediate between the growers and the workers. They say that they will 'top up' any offer from the growers to a wage level they (the government) feels is adequate. The growers will, of course, 'bid low' in such a situation, and the result will be a government subsidy to their businesses. It's unknown at this time if the government offer is acceptable to the workers.   I don't think so. It would merely imply a system with feedback.   Or writes, types, says, yells, broadcasts, sends by smoke signals, communicates, sends by semaphore flags, sends telepathically, calls for, warns, paints, grunts, whispers, mumbles, etc.,etc.. The noun as a subject doesn't guarantee that there is a separate conscious entity with intent that 'does' the verb. The wind may 'warn' you of oncoming rain. The position of the Sun may say that the day is almost over.   Well done.    I'd agree that that is certainly a factor.   I'd guess so though it doesn't seem to connect to idealism in my opinion. "I" is a subject pronoun ie something that does something. "Me" is an object pronoun ie something that is the object of either a verb or a preposition. The first pronoun is an actor, the second something that is acted upon. You use "construct" as a noun, but it comes from the verb "to construct" in the same sense as "building" is to "to build". The difference is built into the English language.   To whomever thinks that they perceive such a thing I'd guess.   Corporatism is *definitely* a word. Historically it meant one of the most important points in the definition of fascism. It means that employers and workers are *compelled* to sit down together in regular planning organizations under the tutelage and with the participation of the state so as to govern and plan the economy. The ideological justification of this is that the population is supposed to work together for the benefit of 'the nation'. These days this sort of management is more often called "tripartism". It exists in all developed countries to one degree or another and with various organizational mechanisms.    Well, it's a possible alternative story to the official one. I'm still agnostic about it though. The main sticking point for me in the official version is why on Earth would they dump the body overboard.   Thanks.   Well, I'd agree with the caveat of "in most circumstances" ie not always. Other than that we're saying the same thing, disagreeing with the claim of the Prime Minister.   I don't think so. It's hard to quantify this sort of thing. There is opposition to the socioeconomic structure in pretty well all countries all the time. Where do you draw the line and say this or that event/organization/struggle/etc. is active enough to go in say a 'plus column'. Judging this sort of thing can end up very subjective. That being said I would (subjectively) say that 2015 is less 'active' than say 2011 (Occupy, Indignados, Arab Spring), and I think it would be hard to argue otherwise.   What city is the school located in ?   I would go with Oceania because I think it is more descriptive of Pacific islands. As for Cuba how about 'Central America/Caribbean' instead of just 'Central America' ? Thanks for the work.   Slightly edited for length - B   I never knew that (that it was invented by a gay man). Can you tell the story ?   Yes, I've seen people blaze through crossings and even weave around lowered barriers. It certainly happens.   Yes, that can happen, but it's unfortunately rare. More frequent though still uncommon is a worker refusal to collect user fees from customers/users/etc. . This tactic has been used in the case of public services such as transportation.  EDIT: I should also add, of course, that there have been instances of 'recuperated' workplaces where production is indeed taken over by the workers and collection by the employer is terminated. The most outstanding example would be the numerous workplace takeovers in Argentina, but there are other examples. The factory in Thessalonica in Greece and a bicycle factory in Germany come to mind, but there are undoubtedly many other examples, some successful, some failures.   I'm unfamiliar with Warren's history. Did she actually used to be a Republican ?   It's a burgeoning field indeed. There are definitely papers that connect the microbiome with neuroscience. As to developmental neuroscience I'm not too sure.   Maybe, but the gradual move away from organized religion began decades before there was such a thing as Facebook. Also, unfortunately, a lower rate of social ties extends beyond the realm of religion. It's been given many names, anomie, alienation, etc., and it goes beyond theological beliefs.    The Hubble is observing in the ultraviolet part of the spectrum for two reasons. One is that it gives a good method to estimate the age of a given white dwarf because as it cools the emissions become less energetic ie change to a smaller frequency/longer wavelength. The second is that it is useful in identifying said stars. The dwarfs *begin* with high radiation in the ultraviolet as compared to an ordinary star because their previous evolution has 'blown away' the outer layers that 'shielded' the hottest part of the star, the core. In a normal star the ultraviolet radiation from the core is absorbed by the outer layers. I hope this clears up the confusion.   The article is from the 'Global Times', published in China with the *permission*, if not with the complete oversight, of the authorities. It takes an aggregate of the top and bottom 20% and compares them. No doubt if you were to take the top 0.1% or 1% the ratio would perhaps be even more astounding than 2 orders of magnitude.  What is remarkable is how far China has progressed in that income inequality is a subject for journalism at all. The numbers may be 'massaged', but the simple admission is a sign of progress.   You're right. It's the original unaltered title so I didn't make the oops.   A lot of things are 'beneath the notice' of the US mass media. World news, of course, cuts into the time allotted to charting the lives of celebrities. One current example is the present scandal surrounding sexual assault on minors by US military personnel stationed in Colombia. It's a big item in Latin America but rarely mentioned domestically even though it *does* involve the USA directly.   It seems like a metaphoric way of saying 1)that he won't grant the demands and 2) increasing wages will simply be eaten up by inflation due to the raises. The part "beyond what the state can offer or has proposed" seems repetitious, but it has an escape hatch if he does decide to compromise. Like any politician or manager he will keep saying 'no' right up to the very hour he does 'yes'. If the unions win (or half win) it will suddenly be discovered that the state *can offer* more than before.  As to the matter of the connection between wages and inflation that is quite a complex matter. There is no one-to-one correspondence between wage rates and inflation. Inflation rates are measured in different ways by different organizations with different 'weighting' of consumer items. Some of these, especially imports. are very insensitive to wage rates in a given country.  I'll give an very simple example - bananas. I think we can be certain that there are no banana plantations in Iceland, and all the bananas are imported. They probably arrive by plane, but there is a small chance they arrive by ship. I don't know. Suppose that the wages of say 40% of Icelanders go up. The cost of importing bananas remains essentially the same. The wages of Icelandic pilots, longshoremen or truck drivers represent a minimal fraction of the cost to the seller in Iceland of those bananas. Now will their increased resources due to higher wages lead a significant number of Icelanders to start eating bananas with every meal ? No. That would be incentive for a retailer in Iceland to increase the price because of higher demand, hence contribute to inflation if bananas are part of the 'consumer basket'. But it doesn't happen. The demand for bananas is not elastic in terms of consumer income.  This is, of course, a simple, even simplistic, example, but many other items are similar. Hence the lack of direct correlation between wage increases and inflation.   Yep, if you're in the boxing ring don't pull your punches.   Or possibly *very quiet* aside from demonstrations. When these sort of things are done in various countries the unions involved make sure to preserve a skeleton staff for essential services. For instance the electricity would still flow, but you wouldn't be able to pay your bill, nor visit the power company office, nor get a person on the phone so you could complain. No doubt this sort of situation is eventually unstable. It usually ends with everything going back to normal with either gains or losses for the workers involved. In rare cases (certainly not in Iceland) either military repression or the fall of the government happens.  So no, not chaos because a lot of day to day activity in a society can indeed be set aside for awhile. Also the action of the strike movement may appear chaotic to some because it poses a threat to their interests, but it is anything but chaotic to the participants.    There have been cases where companies have done *exactly* that, simply tap into the municipal water supply.   The sponsoring organization, Amnesty International, isn't noted for its "shadiness". They have had a stellar record over the decades. You will also note that there is *no* appeal for funds, merely online support. It's not like you are watching a televangelist. As to another to possible sources of doubt: Yes Paraguay *does* have such laws. The arrest of the criminal stepfather was announced on many media outlets yesterday. Google 'Paraguay abortion' and see the coverage. Finally, ten year old girls *can* become pregnant. It's rare, but it happens.  I hope that this may answer your doubts.   Perhaps she already has and he either said 'no' or, more likely, said it would only happen with sufficient public pressure.    It's hard to say what's happening in Raul Castro's mind. It *could* be pure apple polishing. On the other hand there is always a certain nostalgia in the minds of ex-Catholics. Once you get over the anger at the Church you come to appreciate the attractions (mostly not theological) of the tradition. It's not that you wrestle over the doctrine. It's more like you appreciate the art, the music, the lives of (some !) saints, etc.. As for the doctrine... well people have a nostalgia for their childhood as well.   Jones definitely. Not Alex but rather *Jim* Jones of People's Temple fame and the bane of the makers of Kool-Aid. A lot of the people 'over there' with free market views are **very** open in labelling his following as a cult, just like the Ayn Rand cult. His only saving grace is greed. His desire to keep raking in the money is likely the main thing holding him back from a dive straight into the deep end.   Mostly but not entirely right. While not as accurate and precise as sampling from several stations worldwide historical CO2 levels can be estimated from ice cores. From these the CO2 level is the highest in 11,000 years.   Thank you. That's interesting news.   Yep, it has been looked at. Over at the [California Department of Water Resources](http://www.water.ca.gov/desalination) (a busy place these days no doubt) they discuss a project initiated in 2002 that was to fund a mix of feasibility studies, pilot plants and actual operating facilities. They set up the 'California Desalination Task Force' which produced a seemingly detailed report, available on the site, in 2008. Yeah, I know, not lightening speed. I don't know the details about how all this turned out or what the situation is more recently, but I imagine there is more current material available from both this Department and other groups.   Yes, I can see your first point. I think that there may have been other problems with power imported by California, but what they may have been escapes my memory right now. Nuclear in an earthquake zone on the coast of the Pacific wouldn't be a good idea. Think Fukushima. In terms of fossil fuels natural gas would be the least expensive and pose the least environmental problems. But, as you point out, whatever the problems it may be the *only* solution. I wonder if the State has studied this alternative in any detail. I'm going to have a quick look.   Yes, it would naturally be cheaper as there would be no losses of power in transmission. It would also be a 'plus' for oil and gas exporting states, but I can't see how it would be a financial plus for California because it would be a net payment to out-of-state producers. It would, of course, be a plus in the sense of getting potable water, and it may sooner or later become a necessity. I think that the cost would be significant enough to make it necessary for the State to put up some of the seed money. It would probably be beyond the resources of a city. Then I recall that California has had troubles over its debts before. This gets more complicated the longer I think of it.   I don't really know, but I would guess high capital costs and high energy requirements. Saudi Arabia, no surprise there, operates desalination plants, but I don't think they supply the entire country. I also believe that some of the Gulf states do likewise. The advantage there is easy access to a constant supply of oil.   Thanks for this article Mike. I've mentioned RojoyNegroTV here before, but this piece is much more informative than what I presented. One thing I noticed... really and *truly* producing a proper television show and station is a lot more complicated than my limited experience told me. It's a world away from a ten minute video on YouTube for sure. I wonder if other groups such as the French FA might want to do something similar. They do, after all, produce Radio Libertaire.   There's undoubtedly a cost factor in the equation, but the bad publicity they were getting was a factor as well. The first may or may not be a wise economic choice given the capitalization costs of the move versus any long term savings. The latter is an avoidance of loss of income which is also factored in.   I once read that in the ancient Persian Empire that the court had the following way of making decisions. Everyone would get roaring, falling down, vomiting all over yourself drunk and make the decision. Then the next morning (or early afternoon) they'd look at the decision and see if it still looked as good as it did the night before. Seems 'more or less' reasonable to me.   It is. It shows that public pressure *can* have an effect. There has been a long-standing campaign against their plant. It is, admittedly, the proverbial drop in the bucket in the picture of California's water woes.   I also think the bad publicity had a lot to do with it. No doubt they will put the best spin possible on the move. Also, like every other company, they go shopping in the 'tax break market' which often contains outright gifts. They're moving to Pennsylvania though *not* Detroit. That would be about the *last* place they would consider. Whatever else you might say about the executives they aren't crazy, and neither are they drunk 24/7.   That was good. The British answer to 'The Onion' is running ahead of the American it seems.   It depends upon what you mean by "many". An accurate estimate is hard to come by, but let's try something with a few assumptions. Let's set up a little game of 'statistics'. The first thing you have to understand - and accept and realize the implications of - is that for every person who may criticize Obama "from the left" there are something like 20,000 people of other political views. I may be *generous* to 'the left' with this, and I am lumping in *all* forms of leftism in one mass.  Now let's assume that about 50% of these people with *other* views are more or less approving of Obama and either ignorant of or in disagreement with the views of people 'to the left of Obama'. That leaves a number of the order of about 10,000. This means that for every 'leftist' post on a place like r/socialism if you went by pure chance there would be 10,000 people hitting on it who like Obama and only one who looks at him 'from the left'.   Here comes the tricky part. How many of these people might have a more or less favourable view of a word like 'socialism'. This varies from country to country. It would be lowest in the USA but higher in other parts of the 'anglosphere' such as Britain, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and goodly numbers of people in countries such as India, Pakistan, etc. where English is a lingua franca in multilingual nations. Let's try and set a low enough number such as 5%, one in 20. This reduces the likelihood to 500 to one that the viewer would be such an 'Obama friendly' person.  There are, of course, other factors that reduce this still further. Suppose that only 10% of the population are interested enough in politics to cruise the internet looking for subjects such as Obama (a quite high number) or socialism (a lower number). Now we're down to 50 to 1. A certain number immediately flee when they see their Saint criticized, are already heavily prejudiced against Obama and the left in general (already accounted for above), react with anger at the criticism, don't think it's important and skip over it or have sensible arguments about why "Obama is still a better deal" because of realism. Let's say 90% to 95% of the population bow out because of such things. That still leaves 2.5 to 5 people made up of 'Obama believers' to one 'lefty believer'.  Now the final reduction. From pure 'interest' let's say that a 'lefty' is 100 times more likely to keep coming back to a place like r/socialism. This leaves a 2.5 to 5 percent chance that an 'Obama believer' might see such an item and that it registers. This compares *very* favourably with the chances of the usual leftist propaganda, a goodly amount of which is *much* more likely to drive people away than to make the average person reconsider.  Yes, there is a small but not infinitesimal chance that this might do some good. I hope, but don't necessarily believe, that socialists of all stripes might actually *want* to spread their ideas and don't depend on 'conversion experiences' such that other people will accept their views all in a lump like St. Paul on the way to Damascus. It's better and far more likely to change opinions bit by bit. I *know* that certain purist rhetoric drives people away in huge numbers, and I also hope that if it is unlikely that people of different views might visit a site such as r/socialism that people would have enough common sense to understand that this is a **bad thing** that should be changed and nothing to be proud of. I *did* post the item in other places as well by the way.     There's a benefit from learning *any* language even if you aren't fluent in them. Simply knowing words or phrases or grammar points can open your mind and allow you to see many things more clearly.   It may be predictable, but it is also a 'spanner in the works' for some people who are great believers in St. Obama.  	199
 I truly hope i never see flying mounts in WildStar. As a long time WoW player, before flying mounts were introduced, traveling was exciting! You had to be careful not to aggro mobs or perhaps fight your way through areas, you got to see other players along the way and see the monsters they were fighting, you had to meander your way through the environment and sometimes you'd discover hidden, tucked away NPCs and villages you never knew existed before. It made the game feel alive!  Once flying mounts were added the game felt so stale when traveling, you saw a few mountains and poorly rendered villages below that you quickly glided over in a straight line, trying to get from A to B in the fastest way possible. It was boring!  So please Carbine, never add flying mounts, keep traveling as fun as possible.   I feel like the questing would be amazing if they just added more voice acting, problem is that's expensive. Wonder if there are any voice actors who're fans of WildStar and would do it for free :P I know i certainly would.   but it still says ive got 15 wins 15 losses after a team builder game not like my 1500+ normal wins and losses :/   source?   Riot said they'd change it this patch IIRC, but have they?   dunno my friend went to an all star party at some pub. Im from near Newport so dont really know much else on the matter.   There's even league events in Bristol :P   This is by far the easiest and most simpe tool, literally just press a button and it'll tell you your ping http://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/19id2r/nifty_little_tool_to_check_your_ping_na_and_euw/   Oh god i can see all the cosplayers that get WAY to into character being all like "EE KAA DOOO!!!!"   For a few patches now the mute button has been missing, it used to be next to the add friend/report/honor buttons but has since been removed. Why?   http://gyazo.com/db12f2b79980b6ed29b1c3c8681bb8c4 :D   same with annie's W which is find weird condering you can stop stuff like vel'koz's W   [/caitlyn] did i do it?  EDIT: fuck.   How the almighty shits do i lane as Yasuo?   As a Zed main i wish they'd fix the W + Q bug and the bug where he just stands still after using his ult   I added you on league and yet you're not on my friends list :( The unseen friend request is the loneliest. Y U DECLYN MI LUV?   The unseen Zed mains are the jealous...ist....?   I get accused of hacking when i play zed at least once a month. Because putting a fucking insane amount of practice into a champ cant be the reason you were able to kill me, you must be hacking! .   Anyone else had the annoying ult bug(?) where you're chancing an enemy and you go to cast your ult but because of the cast time you end up stopping, the enemy walks out of range and the ult never goes off, so end up stutter stepping? Has made me quite tempted to run move speed quints on her xD   What is OP is wrong, what if Gosu is actually Kaceytron?   Nah he's actually Kaceytron.   yeh something like that, but if i remeber correctly it's due to the dominion pros practicing on that day or something, so you get paired with super good players xD  	22
       agreed--but tanzania--lots of other great things to be found that actually are worth quite a bit.   It's a DOE lab. Expect the basics. But if you like to read, which can be hard without video or pictures, it's a great article.      This system that another oil company (Total) is actually even more powerful, although not by much. And remember, these are just the beasts people KNOW about. http://www.hpcwire.com/hpcwire/2012-02-14/sgi_to_deliver_2.3_petaflop_system_to_total_s.a..html      I guess I didn't realize that something directly from one of the major national labs was not going to be acceptable.       Agreed--Jasper Chert. Which by the way, just solved my problem of what to name a minor character is a story I'm working on. Thanks!   TACC is adamant in this article that it's NOT at all involved with the system itself--that the technology is distinct from any Dell involvement..not sure what is being hinted at.   That patent that's listed is one of three they have to their name. Seems to be the only one that connects to what TACC has going on. This blows top supercomputer IOPS out of the water...      Can you use a toothbrush to expose it a bit more and offer a pic with better lighting?   Fantastic fossil hunting. Some great Devonian (I think) era coral and shell matter.   Agree on the chert--where was this found?       Hi--thank you! I feel silly, but what is this cakeday thing people talk about here? Is that an out of touch question (ha!)   Yes, my nail (with effort) will scratch it...   Hi there! Yes, I think I have found two different answers through /rockhounds. There is an ongoing fight (via someone else's similar specimen) that it is either barite or selenite. It is indeed very heavy for its size--translucent (slightly smoky) spires vertically oriented but with a few horizontal "bars" of yellowish running throughout. No blacklight here, sorry.   Hey, I didn't downvote you--I actually upvoted you...what the heck? ... I appreciate your help!   And the slinky wave is entertaining :)   I did a google search for selenite after seeing your comment about that below and it doesn't look like this either. Here is my specimen photo, similar to OP's - found in Denver, CO http://imgur.com/mm3dUCk    Incredible and beautifully displayed...   Thanks for adding this--why isn't this commonly given as a form, I wonder. Is it that it's an uncommon form do you think?   Hi, i am inclined to agree. I just posted a pic in /whatisthisrock of the exact same stuff--down to the yellowish stripe--that I found in Colorado recently. And agreed, doesn't look like barite as I see it elsewhere. I'll follow this thread closely to see what they tell you.   Can someone help me ID this? I have done some research, a few options but still not sure. Thank you!      Can you help me ID this? http://imgur.com/mm3dUCk   Thanks, all!            Google+, is that you?                              Looks like a concretion...So yes, probably a natural sedimentary formation. These can be tricky because they often look  "purposeful"....neat find, lucky you on the arrowheads   Well, they've removed it in this offering--this is what makes the Flex system what it is but some people, from what I understand, decided that Flex was too locky for their tastes--they wanted to have flexibility on switching, mgmt, etc... There is an SDN feature here too but it's not been explained thoroughly--or maybe that's something that's coming soon (like the GPU, Phi, direct water, etc)...   If the server market numbers from IDC and others is any indication--people DO want these. The question is, would they want them from IBM when, as mentioned in the article, HP, Supermicro, Dell and others are going to stick it on the price (not to mention the flexibility--i.e. for now it's just Xeon E5) -- It's hard to see IBM competing in the "made in China" wars but this does seem to be where the server market itself is going--Open Compute-inspired, stripped down systems that are purpose-driven and free from the cumbersome crap (like Platform's workload mgr, etc--things included here)...  All server makers on the HPC side are confused.         Also--now pretty sure it's shale with the ripples. Did a fair bit of research--all signs point to this. But this thing isn't part of the ripple. Has the hard shiny (after wearing down) parts on the "bones" of it but not anywhere else.   I have something similar--it is shale and has lines in it from fossilized mud/ripples. It seems to break in odd places so sometimes it looks like something more interesting than it is. I have broken a few of mine, sanded others down, but only one appears to be really interesting/have something unique (in this case a foot/print).   I am not as smart as you--can you tell me how you're so certain so I can proceed better with my own research? Thanks!   I just uploaded some photos of other similar pieces I brought back from the same location (all in one area about 20 x 20 with nothing else like it around--I've looked repeatedly).  See here http://imgur.com/a/LH9zc   That looks about right...   Also, these came from the High Point area--   Well, hello neighbor--I am in High Point. Found these in one giant patch of similar thick rocks with ripples and brought many of them home. They were in a MOST geologically strange location--crystals unlike I've seen a couple of (seriously) amethyst points. Never seen anything like it.   These are not stromatolites for sure. Got a bunch of those already--these things are thick, like layers and layers of ancient mud. I will take a few photos in a little bit to give you a sense of what some of the others are with my tiny, tiny hands as scale (ha--seriously).  Love the Pteridinium but this thing would have to be many yards long and there's not enough regularity.  Pics coming in 10 minutes or so of some of my other hunks. Again--weird locale. Amethyst points (2), an emerald, and what appears to be citrine. Not sure what to think.   Okay--off to photograph for you!   Thanks so much for taking the time and thought to send the link and ideas. I have a number of other pieces of this "fossilized mud" stuff that look somewhat similar to the pieces there, but they are VERY thick. Some of the pieces are 6-8 inches thick, others thicker. It looks like this (which I found after a long search for anything similar) http://getoffourplanet.com/?p=3603  The weird thing is, the "bones" in this are black and much harder than the surrounding rock. It is possible for me to clean around it and those remain. Afraid to do so until I know more.  To answer your question, there is no curvature to any of the chunks I have--the link above is almost exactly what this stuff looks like. Oddly enough, there isn't anything clearly visible that's fossilized in anything other than the deep ripples (which incidentally, when a big one broke, the ripples go all the way through--completely 3D).  I am so glad you sent that info. It helps me keep an eye for other exciting things in the vicinity!     I found a number of pieces of fossilized, dark mud in a riverbed in central north carolina. Surrounded by some of the most perfectly formed quartz points I've seen around here, to boot. Strange place... Most of the fossilized mud pieces are straight or slightly wavy lines. Light sanding tones them down. But under these "toes" or whatever they are it's black hard rock, different than what makes these up. Can anyone help me ID? I am new to this...  	56

 Haha, that's sweet. I'm happy for you guys, treasure each other.    Thank you for your kind words.    I know it's easier said than done, but enjoying your time together is a million times better than worrying. Diane loved Portal. She would sing the songs from both. The graphics in Portal 2 gave her motion sickness, sometimes, though.     Thank you. I used to be cynical about such things but there's no way I could have survived this if Diane hadn't assured me that she's still out there somewhere. She knew that.   I know she has to be a very pure soul in order to pull something like that off, so wherever she is now, must be a good place. She deserves that more than anyone I've ever met.    Thank you, and I do feel very fortunate for our last few hours together. I attribute that entirely to Diane being a very pure soul.   	5
 /r/popping    That's happened to me a few times, I have worked at the same Country Club for 6 years. Each time they get closer to me.    Wtf did I just read?    Left over blow- duh...   Hello neighbor!    Toledo, Ohio.    I want to have really intense, mind blowin sex in there then take pictures of the handprints.   Is that weird?    You. Your man-bun. Your beard.   Ever close to Ohio, let me know.    Your mike has a blackhead. Lol that's what I see atleast   If only....   Quite clever    Idk that nipple tho....   For this, I would have also. I'm losing my mind.   Pull be pregnant in a couple months.    Post this to /r/popping and take a look at some of the other Plantar Warts on there!    I think it's strangely hot.   Hairy bum.   Maybe that's why Gary meows in Spongbob   Cyst* and share this on /r/popping they would enjoy it.    I cannot find it, I dug for it..      Thank you for delivering OP!    I've always used a bobby pin or an extractor. It helps to have someone help you with the ones in your ears. SOMEONE WITH A STEADY HAND. You DO NOT want someone to slip and rupture anything inside your ear.   Happy popping!    I would love to see a picture of the bathroom.   I'm a medium. I have spoken to the deceased for years, starting when I was about 6-7. (21/f) Not only that I'm an active member at our local paranormal group. People have brought me into their homes to try to figure out what was going on.   You need to research the property, and surrounding areas land. You need to be sure that no one in the home has brought home any new items.   Please be aware that even though you told this entity to leave does not mean it will not return. (I am not trying to scare you.)   We like to say that sometimes spirits will go dormant. They do also cycle. Haunt at specific times of the year, things like that.  Please post pictures, I would love to see the dog also.   Best of luck to you, and remember- we are never alone. We chose to see what we allow ourselves to.    I don't think that is harsh at all...any crime against a child is haneous.    Let's find these girls and slap them, too many people I know have does from Molly. She is not your friend.  	26
 I'm super excited for final book, as well. But haven't heard anything.  However, on the [Amazon](http://www.amazon.co.uk/City-Mirrors-Justin-Cronin/dp/0752897896/ref=sr_1_1?s=books ie=UTF8 qid=1434363208 sr=1-1 keywords=city+of+mirrors) page for it, they seem to be standing on December 31st 2016 release date.   "Is your name winter? - 'Cause you'll be coming soon."  :)   Have to jump in and say how *vastly* superior *Morrowind* was to *Oblivion*. Morrowind was so, so good. Highly recommend.   thx      Yeah I think your right about that. I just don't think Bane was any kind of follow-up to the Joker. If Bane had come first it might have been a different story, the problem was that he had to follow Ledger's Joker. Nolan dug himself a hole with such a brilliant villain, and a great film. There was no way the third film could have competed against it.  Having said that TDKR is by all standards a decent film. And you have to respect the shit out of Nolan for actually ripping a plane to pieces, rather then hollywood-ising it and using CG. The rest of the film could have been shit (it wouldn't) but that remains one of the best opening scenes to a film ever.   For the masterpiece that was *The Dark Knight*?! Everyone needs to make time! :D   Thinking of buying a game at half price (Civ 5). Is there a guarantee the price won't drop at a later day in the sale?    Damn is it that time of year again. What a terrible time to lose my job :(   You watch the sequel? The Dark Knight Rises. Would be interested to see what you thought about that.  What compelled you into rewatching it?   It's hard to say without reading the previous Sapkowski novels, or playing the original 2 TES games. 3 if you never played Morrowind.   Morrowind was an entire construction in it's own. They wrote novel after novel of information for that game, just to create backstory. The world has been growing since the very first TES game 'Arena'. For contemporary players - who perhaps joined at Oblivion, or even Skyrim, there might not be a lot to offer.   Equally, people who only joined the game at The Wild Hunt might miss out on a lot of the world only gleamed through either the original novels, or the first two games.   I think what settles this is where they came from. TES was never meant to be more than a game. The aim of its construction was, above all, to make a game that was as enjoyable as possible. It was built on the idea of *there's a goblin, here's a pointy thing.' And the world has been growing ever since.  Unfortunately, due to the polish origins (I don't speak Polish) and the fact I joined TES shortly after Morrowind's release, and the Witcher during the seconds 360 release, I don't know as much about The Witcher's backstory. However the depth of the world can be seen as thus; one is aimed at gamers. At the time of Arena's release this was a bunch of teenage boys. The Witcher however aimed immediately at a more adult market, went into the world darker and with a more likeable protagonist. (The world only shines as bright as it's protagonists).   So if you want to compare each world as a whole, the political intrigue, character division, and depth of the beasts lends The Witcher strong marks. TES draws far too heavily on medieval England, and populates its world fairly predictably. I would have to go with The Witcher.  However if you were implying to only question the *game* worlds of Skyrim vs The Witcher continent as seen through their flagship games - you would have to go Witcher also. This is however an unfair question given the years between releases.   Skyrim set out to do something fantastic, and it did. It remains one of the best fantasy RPG games of all time. It might still hold the mantle (DA:Inquisition turning into something of a colossal disappointment). And Wild Hunt has the technology (and brilliant studio) behind it to really push the boundaries of what they can do. The world is more alive and aesthetically stunning. Skyrim I felt was better to explore - you were more likely to come across something you wouldn't expect to. Whereas in the Witcher - Geralt's entire mode of life is to find and kill monsters, which takes a sheen off finding and killing monsters when you approach it with a calculated, almost contrived mindset.   Having said that, I would much rather explore the world of The Witcher - not just for it's aesthetics, but for the people, the fantastic monsters, the quests that are more than just 'kill, x 10' (though those do exist).  So yeah, I didn't expect this to be so one-sided when I set out. I though I would back TES far more than this, but, hands down, The Witcher.  Having said that, let's see what Fallout 4 produces. Which will give us a neat idea of what the next installment in TES will be. Bethesda are one of the best studios going and I trust what they produce to be excellent.  Edit: Grammar   I'm sorry, I read the whole post but am still blindsided by the title.  This is only your second viewing. *Since 2008?*    Inside Out will change that!   Same as Cars 2. Though MU was better. Brave was a bit...naff also.   I loved MU too, I'm just not sure how well it fed into the first one. Or compared to it.      Up, man. UP is Pixar's best. Though they really do make some of the unparalleled best films of all time.   I trust implicitly that Inside Out will be excellent.   I was a little bit later when Toy Story came out.   But when Pixar surged - The Incredibles, Finding Nemo, Monsters Inc, they were amazing.    The old Disney days were awesome.  But Disney cant compare to Pixar - not even a little bit.  UP. UP is just amazing.  But even that isn't as good as *How to Train Your Dragon 2*.  Favouritest bestest ever kids film.   I was pretty happy with my first rejection. It wasn't as if I had been expecting anything else. I wasn't disappointed (around the fourth that came in - then it got worse). It felt to me like I had done something. Taken a step towards my dream. Proved that I was capable of putting myself out there.   It also meant another 6 months of editing but, hey, what ya gonna do?  Congrats is all I can say =]   Support for the previous consoles hasn't died out, or for PC. Why not get Fallout 3? And try it. It'll give you the best insight into whether or not you'll like Fallout 4. The stories won't interact, so no worries there, but you'll get a feel for the world and gameplay.  New Vegas wasn't made by Bethesda - but FO3 and FO4 are. Just to bear in mind.   It was a werewolf flick, but I didn't really have anything to write. I gave up.    Know what I'm doing tomorrow =]   Night, sleep well, stranger =]   :(  :((  :(((  (x3 sad, not double and triple chin - would perhaps looks like that if I ate them shortbreads though ;).)  Looking good, thanks for the sharing dem cooking skills =]   The thing about the niche is that right now it isn't niche enough, and I need to dig deeper. I'm happy to dive in as is (so long as my friend comes aboard), but I understand it might go a bit better with a bit more planning.    Not burnt yet, and looking **delicious**.  ...  hungry   Half of convincing my friend is encouraging them to stick through the initial slow-phase. The first few months of barrenness, and hoping it pays off.   I have an interesting niche in mind, but I'm not too sure how well it will work out. Just because it's YT, and there's a lot of stuff out there, and hundreds of people trying to *make it*.   But thanks for the advice, I appreciate it. Anything advice right now is useful.   Never heard of that show. Sounds a bit Twilight Zone-y.   Green tea is a sin. Any tea but normal tea is a sin against tea, and the British. Power to Tea! I just love tea. If I'm feeling particularly withdrawn from tea, and finally get a drink, I do love it in my stomach, all warm and snuggly =]  I've given up on the story now. Was just trying to write for the sake of it. I failed.   Share a picture when they're done. I want to see that delicious biscuity-goodness :D   *-wishes he could now eat shortbread.-* Thanks for taking time out of your baking to share with me, and make me crave shortbread biscuits whilst I'm all tucked up and cozy in bed.   The worst of it? We don't know why we actually need to sleep. We just do! Just 'cause. No reason we know of. Yep, wasting 1/3 of our day, every day. I dislike.   Gaming. Within the 'Lets Play' vein of videos. But with potential to break out into more versatile areas.   It's a matter of convincing my friend to put in the time and effort. Especially the beginning few months where, on the more exciting videos, we might break 100 views.    I'm doing quite well, thanks for asking. Starting to get a bit tired, now, but I can go on a bit longer.   Coming along then. Getting there, slowly. I always say a project is serious (or "Main") when it reaches 20k.   Interesting concept. What's the word count on it now?   I usually find myself like this. Happier to stay awake ridiculously late and have a decent lie-in in the morning. I'm more awake and more active this time of the evening/night.  What anime? How's your tea? (Tea: nectar of the gods). I'm working slowly on a story, but not a very good one.   Sounds like a good day. What was the project?   Three novels, hey? Interesting way to do it. Nothing wrong with a break, but what are your novel's about?  Yeah I'm a writer, I get interested in and like talking to other writers about the craft.   So long as you enjoy it, that's what it's all about.  Ever written anything longer? A novel? Am I distracting you now? Are you procrastinating, haha.   It's a good thing you wrote it in that order. Because even though it started out rough it's turning around and starting to work out in your favour. There's not a lot you can do right now except enjoy all the free-time you've suddenly got as a single man. That's what I did when I became single. Found new hobbies, read more, just spent more time to myself, and it was great.   We hiked through the Cairngorms and up the mountain. Visited more castles (and subsequently learned a shitload of Scottish history) than I thought possible to do in one week. And I also climbed Ben Nevis. So...yeah...been to the highest point in the UK. Whoo =]   I'm just sitting here thinking of my own ideas like - *damn, that's a good idea...my ideas are shit...*  I'm sure the mods won't, hopefully I won't miss it.    Sounds like a more exciting Wednesday evening than the one I'm having.   I like to keep myself going on here, never be wholly absent. Try and have a thread going now and then, so I'm not *just* lurking. I wanted to know what was happening on the internet and reddit - on the other hand, some damn beautiful views in Scotland.   Sounds like a fun challenge, albeit difficult. Good luck getting all those done.  Also...interesting concept. Does the reader know from the beginning he's going to visit his own grave? Or is that the twist?  If you remember me, show me the collection for free on Kindle I wouldn't mind taking a peek =]   Sounds awesome. Just kicking back, enjoying not having to sleep?   Reddit altogether. I went on a week-and-a-half hiking holiday to Scotland. Was pretty much away from the internet. And most technology (except phone and car). A week away from Reddit - it was hard, man.   What's kept you up so late?   A writer! What's the short about? Plan on doing anything with it?   I stay the hell away from creepy stuff. I watched the new 'Evil Dead', and my girlfriend succesfully bribed to watch 'Sinister' with her in cinema (for *Dishonored* - which was totally worth it). And yeah...I did not sleep for weeks after each one. Every time I stumble across something I think might be creepy I just turn it off - it's not worth it.  I'm good at the moment, just feeling alive, like I want to do something. So I thought I'd catch up with CC as I haven't been on in a while =]   A little undeveloped at the moment. Need to work on it, make it more watchable, try and evaluate if it would actually work. See if my friend - who I have ran the idea past - is as interested as they seem, or if they were just humouring me...   Gaming videos. Don't worry, I know a million of those exist already but I have my own little niche to bring to it.    Sounds good to me.   Anyone else ever just in the mood to stay up all night for the sake of it, yeah, I'm currently going through that.   Current thought: I'm currently trying to devise a way to make money. A youtube channel is a good idea - but I need to convince my friend to do it with me, hmm.  Anyway, how are you?   Me and my then girlfriend were playing it. So got lost in the castle and our lantern went out. I gave up then.    I don't know a single person who wouldn't take those odds. Ok, a few, perhaps. But being able to *choose* to fly, or run super-fast, etc. Who wouldn't?   Well, it wouldn't be surgerical. It's a hypothetical; the procedure takes place in whatever way you're comfortable with :).    Couple'a months... at the most.    So a question I came up with, that I like to ask people:  You have the choice to undergo a procedure to get superpowers. The chances of it working are slim, and, if it doesn't, you'll die horribly and slowly of radiation poisoning. So - is it worth the risk?  1) You don't get to choose the superpower. It could be anything. It could be great (super speeds, flying) it could be crap, like controlling cheese or something.   2) You can't kill yourself if the procedure fails. You have to suffer. That's the point.  Dying a slow and horrible death worth even the slightest possibility of gaining superpowers? Let me know.   I think I read a lot. Probably went a film-binge. Kept an eye on my emails, kept refreshing every 5 minutes.   And, of course, got very, very drunk.    AH! This is so true. This book was so much more amazing than I thought. It truly is exceptional. Easily one of the best books I have ever read.   Just finished *Flowers for Algernon*, by Keyes. And just started *Smoke and Mirrors*, by Gaiman.   [Following this thread]   Promising review.   How does the combat go? Feel? Is it unique or same as all the other MMO's? What are the classes like?   Let me know when you've given it a chance. I've sorta kept an eye on it, enough to hear it was almost definitely going F2P (and it did), but I've played enough MMO's to be skeptical.   How is it? Any good? Might give it a try.   I've read about it just, and what I've read isn't comforting. So I know it's not just me. It's a save game bug, where I can't save the game manually. When I jumped into the game this morning there were frame-rate issues, especially bad during combat, so I wanted to save and quit and reload and hope that worked. But now I'm scared to quit unless the game throws me back a few hours. Every solution to the issue seems to risk losing my entire save file and the hours I've put into the game already.  Anybody else ran into this issue? Apparently it's not just affecting the Xbone but PS4 and PC as well - though the PC fix seems easier and more likely to not mess up the game.  I mean, otherwise a really excellent game. Cheer me up, gamers =[   Kvothe is one of, if not the, most compelling characters I've ever read. You haven't met Ambrose yet but when you do, you'll loathe him just because Kvothe does. When Kvothe doesn't succeed, I've never felt so bad for any character, nor wanted one to succeed just so much. Rothfuss does a brilliant job of making you sympathise with Kvothe on a really human level. And that is excellent.  But yeah, mostly he is an utter badass.   I cannot recommend you finish TNotW and TWMF ASAP! Two of the best books I've ever read. And I still really want to get round to the The Dresden Files but my backlog is heavy enough as it is.   But yeah, de-prioritise everything else, read TKKC. That's my advice.   I didn't watch that one tbh. Too busy playing the Witcher. But the channel is really interesting. The first half of the video - which I watched - was really good. Check it out: [Clickity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNuQZPTHALI)   Not doing any reading? Throw in some reading there =]   [My life isn't very interesting](http://imgur.com/nnxXHrj)   Trying super hard to be objective. Why didn't you like it.  I also point out that I personally think Ocean is his best, some people prefer American Gods, others prefer Neverwhere.q   I wasn't implying to start using Unity, just they have a better community over there. I think earning attaining skills is the best way to go, just speaking from my own experiences trying to find a way into the industry.   Because I couldn't find the others. Don't want to join in on a dead thread. Start my own and cover new ground, rather than trek old ones.   There's enough to be going on with online. I know you want to work in UE but if you're working with one of the C's, of Java, the community over on the Unity site are super helpful. There are other programming sites, and even Reddit should be able to help with any niggling questions. If you push at it hard enough you can teach yourself to program.  What kind of design do you mean?   Biggest hurdle will be not having anything to offer.  Can you design, or draw or program? Perhaps an internship is the best way to go. The industry is so damn saturated these days that you need to be above the best to even be considered.   UE4 is a great way to go, and learning on your own is rewarding. But difficult. Ridiculously difficult. I tried it. Programming is hard, and modelling is hard, and GUI and sprites and textures are hard.  It's a lengthy process but one of the most rewarding you'll ever do. Just gotta stick at it.   Ah, got it. Listening to it now thankyou.  I thought it was a BBC radio thing. Sounds awesome.   This game, though excellent, takes on a whole new perspective, and reaches unseen emotional heights, upon completion. You simply have to finish it. I just...the game - the story - isn't the same without the ending. It needs it.   To me his emotional growth was spearheaded by the *other charlie*, and that his own emotional growth was subdued, especially compared to his intellectual growth, by his traumatic childhood experiences. His emotional growth wouldn't have been so impeded were it not for his childhood trauma, and how it came to him so slowly, piece by piece so he could never come to terms with it in one go. That kept his emotional level at that of a child, far more than his intellectual growth. Emotionally he was at the point where he could sleep with Fay, but due to *other Charlie*, he couldn't sleep with Alice.   I read the last fourty of thirty pages in one go, so I got pretty much the events leading up to his decline, and the decline itself in one go. When his sentences fell apart, and his spelling decline, that when it really hit me. Harder I thought than it was going to, because everyone saw that coming. It was just before the decline when he said he could never go back to being, as he put it, retarded. And then during his decline he said was much happier in his current state, that was what got me.   Where can I find it?   Hey, I didn't read the whole post because...spoilers. I just wanted to ask. How good was the audiobook? Cumberbatch a decent narrator? How long is it? I'm not overly fond of audiobooks, but I would make an exception.   Thanks in advance, I've wanted to get round to this for ages, and this is a really good excuse for me to do so.   I felt a good takeaway from the book was actually about introversion. For a book about a super-genius it was about 100% more existential than I thought it would be.   But yeah, particularly towards the end the book took a pretty dark turn, and it did bottle-neck the message into: stay stupid; stay happy.   But the book was really only about Charlie, I didn't perceive it as an allegory for anything, I never read through it thinking there was a message it was trying to get across. It was a ride, and a good one.   I studied Media for five years, I have a degree in it. And damn didn't I spend four of those five years wishing I had studied gaming.  Kudos to you, I say. *Do something you love and you'll never work a day in your life.*   How are you breaking into the industry? Are you just venturing out on your own making indie games? Or looking to break into a large studio?   You don't. You get to know them better. Then you're not uncomfortable anymore; you know them.    Ya know I see a lot of these on CC. It always cheers me up seeing something like this and just knowing that a stranger, at least as far as I know, is doing well in life. That might be weird, but it's more cheerful than seeing the news. I just know that if I pop over to CC I will see at least 80% of the threads are cheerful and life-affirming. And the 20% that aren't, anyone who reads them almost always comments something positive.   Thanks stranger, I'm happy your life is working out :)   It did seem to be a central theme that intelligence generally equaled unhappiness. Which was super-important in Charlie's case. I went in expecting it to kinda praise intelligence but it really didn't. I guess that's one of the reasons the book is so good.   I know there's been a lot of threads about this book, but I've avoided them for spoilers. Now I've finished it I want to hear what you thought of it.   **Spoilers will follow**     First of all watch the film.  Second of all watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=98j1Sb97usg). It will be a major help in understanding parts of the book. But it is spoiler-ific, which is why I recommend the film first.   Once you've seen both I think then you'll be able to appreciate the book. I watched that YT video *after* I had read the book, and everything really just fell into place, with regards to the book. So I think it's worth watching first.      No. Only one. Christopher Nolan.   He just is. Perfect in every way. He doesn't make mistakes. He is the best.    All hail our lord and cinematic saviour Christopher Nolan. He is a god.   THis is absolutely beautiful. I'm super exciting, but ya know what annoys me? And The Witcher isn't the only culprit.   It really annoys me when you get the game case *and a steelbook!* I mean, *of course* I want to use the steelbook but *the hell am I gunna do with this wasted *normal* *case?* Now I just have a spare case for the shits and giggles, damnit!  Didn't know it came with a cloth map though, very nice touch.   Awesome work. Very nice and effective.  Still annoyed they changed the acronym. I mean - talk about doing something just for the sake of it!   Got me as well, at first. Boy did I feel silly when Morgenstern wasn't real.   Witcher 3   What role were you doing?    Maybe The Last of Us. But, if I remember correctly, Far Cry 3's *Blood Dragon* was pretty good. It might just have been that the ending to that game was probably the best of any game I've played, really.   It's 10:40 AM in the morning and I woke up not so long ago. Chilling in bed reading.   American Gods is absolutely amazing. Of course it's not as good as The Ocean at the End of the Lane - which is his best. His short stories are also well worth a read. He has three collections and they are all brilliant.   Your friend just needs to stretch his gaming muscle.    Good bit of broth there =]  Hmm, Olive and Whale Blubber Broth. Dinner of kings.   So if I ever get this game I will scour every coast for a beached whale now, to discover if this was a chance incident in your game, or implemented into every single one. Just how much can CDProjektRed impress me?   Ooh, do me. Do me!   Depends if you want to live-stream it via twitch or make a let's play YT channel.  As far as live-streaming go, there's really no reason not to stream live from the Xbone, it cuts out the middle-man (PC) and is just nifty and a lot more stream-lined, with faster streaming speeds, which means higher quality.  Capturing it is another story. There really isn't any way to do it other than with a capture card (heretofore called CC). CC's can cost a fair bit of money, but you do, of course, get what you pay for. Like I said mine was 100 but is one of the best on the market. Especially for the new generation, like the Xbox one.   If you give me an idea of the kind of format you're going for - what you plan on doing. I can give you an idea of the best way to do it, if that helps.   If I'd have stuck with it however my plan would have been to stream and LP both. Stream games that are more drop-in-drop-out. Games on COD, silly run-throughs, shorter, possibly indie, games. And then do YT LP's of the more serious plays, the story driven games, or the longer ones. I suppose the plan was to create a larger fan base, and, of course, play as many games as possible, and get the most from each one.   How's that 1 olive working out for you? :D   Live streaming from PC? *OBS*. Easy to use and connects straight to Twitch account. There is also *Xsplit* but that isn't as recommended.   Of course Steam has its own streaming now, so you can use that.  From consoles? The new generation (Xbone, PS4) have twitch apps you can download and stream straight from console, all you need is internet and a mic. Kinect can also be used as a cam if you want (I assume PS Move can too).   From older consoles? You might need a capture card. I own the *Game Capture HD*. The card itself cost me 100 quid, but the program to stream is free. Comes with all the necessary cables and works with every console I've tried it on, which is everything but the Wii U (though it does have issues with PS3). Also, it should work fine with the Wii U, I just haven't tested that one out yet. There are cheaper alternatives.   Ah...I think that's everything covered.   Of course then it comes down to production values. I have used a Guitar Hero Mic plugged into my laptop, and that worked fine, better than the built in one. But if you want to look pretty, I recommend a decent webcam and mic. They can be somewhat cheap, depends what you want.   Editing is also super easy these days. But if you, again, want the professional sheen I recommend Final Cut Express. It's pretty much iMovie or Windows Movie Maker but a bit hyped up. It's approaching professionalism. A little bit more pristine is Final Cut X, but that'll set you back more than a bit. iMovie and WMM do the job fine, and to start out with, they're perfect.  As for content; that's down to you. There are plenty of guides out there.   Ooh that is painful too :( I feel for you, broken TV is not cool.   We can be sad together.   Yeah, I just ain't that good, m'afraid. I write for games though. Mind you, not a lot of money in that so far.   Man, that could be weeks. I was all set to pick it up tomorrow.  	112
       **Dat selfie-bration!**               "Sorry, this is Kieran Gibbs."    I wonder if Oliver Khan is related to Genghis in any way. They're both big and scary so they're probably related or something.       The stars have aligned.          American Pharoah and Ryan Howard must be related.    I found some more information about this story that is pretty interesting. I've redacted both personal and identifying information, just to be safe with the mods of this sub. I don't know if posting personal information about a dead boy who was never a redditor is an issue but I don't want to get into trouble with the mods. They've let wholeinabucket's comment stand even though he named the boy but I'm not sure if the mods will remove the comment for personal info if and when they see it. This boy killed himself in 1999.   At one of the largest high schools in North  Texas, a single gunshot brought grief and shock to students and parents.  Classes had barely begun Thursday morning at Richland High School in  North Richland Hills when a young student, described as a loner,  took his own life. School administrators scrambled to keep school open,  but many students went home for the day. It happened right after the  morning bell in a bathroom right off the main lobby. Sophomore [John Doe]  walked into a stall, pulled out a nine-millimeter pistol, and shot  himself, once in the head. The student was rushed to a nearby hospital  where he was pronounced dead.    Freshman [redacted] said, You hear girls crying. Its so sad.  So sad, people we go to school with. So sad... As news of the tragedy  spread, anxious parents showed up to claim their children. Some worried  about how easy it is to bring a gun inside a school with no metal  detectors. [redacted] is a parent. Theres a firearm in the school.  Regardless of whether he took his own life or someone elses life, there  was a gun in the school. School officials say there hasnt been much  trouble at the school before.    [redacted] is with the Birdville ISD. Im sure this will be  reviewed. This has not been an issue. Its sort of a fine line you walk,  do you want metal detectors at all entrances of a high school facility.  Or is this an isolated incident.    NBC Fives [redacted] reports that police werent the only ones at the  school after the shooting. About a dozen counselors and volunteer  chaplains were on hand to help students cope with what happened.  Theyre meeting one on one and in small groups, talking about the  tragedy and trying to prevent another one. Reverend [redacted] said,  Its a big concern because to a lot of young people its a viable  option. And of course, were telling them its not a viable option. Life  is worth living. There are people who will help you and love you. The  pastor says the student who killed himself, [John Doe], had no  trouble with drugs or girlfriends. But he also says the teenager wrote  some 8 to 10 letters to friends on Wednesday, which have now been given  to police.    The ordeal shook up other students who didnt even know the boy, who  wonder what could have gone so wrong? One student who knew [John Doe]  described him as being very depressed. The student said [John Doe] never  played with the other students in gym class.  ...   Diary of a cult member   By [redacted]    NORTH TEXAS - 16-year-old [John Doe] committed suicide Thursday at  his high school. Journals he left behind indicate a confused young man  torn between a dangerous cult and doing what was right. They give a  frightening look into the world of a teenager who took his own life.    [His parents] say they had no idea their son was so  torn up inside, not until he killed himself and left behind personal  notes and a journal describing every day of his life for the past year.  [His father] says, He was extremely confused. He was being bombarded with  questions in his head, Whats right, whats wrong, what do I believe,  what am I doing, what should I do next.    Through words and pictures, [John Doe] described his involvement with a  so-called Wiccan Cult. The beliefs were far from the traditional Wiccan  Religion, whose members practice white magic, and encourage harmony with  nature. His dad says, Its contorted and deformed the way theyve done  it. Theres nothing good about it. The Wiccan Religion was of good  things that you can do and anyone that would do evil with it was not  accepted and they were cast out.    [John Doe], too, was apparently cast out of his group once members realized  his true intentions, to help others get out. His father found a  disturbing letter filled with threats from a fellow cult member. [The father]  says the letter said, We will join together against you, your Catholic,  anti-atheist group. The letter went on to describe how [John Doe's]  deviation from the cult would result in a so-called dreamscape trial.  [John Doe's] step-mom [redacted] says, Entering and attacking a person  through their dreams. They quote, unquote, kind of call it a dreamscape  and even if the person doesnt want to participate they can still do  it.    [John Doe's] journal also described the study of two books: The  Necrinomicon, or The Book of the Dead, and The Satanic Bible. Some cult  experts say whatever his intentions, [John Doe] was simply messing with  something way too dangerous. [redacted] of Watchman Fellowship, Inc.  says, Theres a lot more to it than maybe they initially believe.  Rather than just an innocuous investigation or morbid curiosity, they  actually find themselves being drawn into the lifestyle. A lot of times  the quest for personal power becomes overwhelming.    Its advice too late for [John Doe], but information his parents hope  will reach others whom may be lost and searching for answers. [John Doe]s  family and friends gathered for his funeral in North Richland Hills on  Monday. Pastor [redacted] told the congregation [John Doe] is now living  peacefully in heaven.      What genius at FOX thought that it would be a good idea to put Alexi Lalas and Eric Wynalda in the same room on TV at the same time? Do they want me to change the channel or watch a shitty Vietnamese stream instead?            So when is the wedding?    "You invited The Moos?"

Major Colvin must have moved them all over to Hamsterdam while you were in the hospital.     I wonder if there's a way to help him make the community center he's building more secure?

The guy could use any crowdfunding money that he gets from us to hire Darien Long as security for the community center.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XO4luf3PRC4)   Unpopular opinion/question time...

Read my previous reply :)   Maybe I'm over-reacting a bit, and I normally take documentaries with a grain of sand, but this just really got to me. I just cannot believe what these bastards have gotten away with and how they treat their people. How they practically used people, such as Tom Cruise, to gain power and superiority. Also, how they basically destroyed his marriage to Nicole Kidman. Don't even get me started on that bastard Miscavige....  Like I said, how true can all this be? It seems pretty legit to me. I just wanted to see if anyone else feels the same way :)      this just puts mine to shame...   sorry all the photos are sideways      1. It (hmmmm bring me that remake)  2. The Stand  3.

Yeah the one I ordered from the UK was region B. Yeah I saw on eBay the ones from Japan were like $98!!! But yeah I was just wandering if they were actually releasing an Australian edition :)   I live in Australia, I just ordered the bluray out of the UK! Do you know if they are releasing it in Australia?      So you liked Spirited Away?  [This man](https://www.google.com.au/?gws_rd=ssl#q=hayao+miyazaki+movies) is a god, watch all of his films including the documentary they made about him recently.  Also, the [studio](https://www.google.com.au/?gws_rd=ssl#q=studio+ghibli+movies) he works for, watch all of their movies as well.    A Bioshock film.   Nightcrawler  Whiplash  Foxcatcher  Birdman      Killer Croc in Suicide Squad? Man this just keeps getting better and better.    Scene it. Pun intended.      I love Dredd, pity we won't be getting a sequel :/                  At one point, you didn't know either.   what does TL:DR stand for? :P      Clint Eastwood hasn't directed a straight up comedy, not that I am aware of, so my guess is that it will be serious.         My respect for this man and his work just went through the fucking roof after my first viewing, I implore you to watch it.      Well I want to be a cinematographer, so really anything at all will do :)      Thank you very much   **I posted something similar to this on r/cinematography, but only few people could help me**   I just wanted to see if you guys had some more/better recommendations. Any book to do with the art of visual storytelling or cinematography will be much appreciated. Thanks!   "You could land a jumbo fuckin jet in there!"      I am speechless. Your sir, deserve an award.      Watch 127 hourse.  James Franco KNOCKS IT OUT OF THE PARK.   I think this will be great.

Source Code, End of Watch, Enemy, Prisoners, Nightcrawler and now this. Gyllenhaal's career is going the roof.   i'll check it out   wow, thanks a lot for that.      why all the downvotes? :/   Marvel movies are my thing...  In a nutshell, I think recently with The Winter Soldier, marvel movies are becoming more cinematic. I think this is happening with AoU as well.  Read the link I sent the other guy.   I probably should've gone into a little more detail, but yeah that's exactly what I mean.   I shall.   What I mean is I didn't feel that the first one had the characteristics of a film, it didn't present itself as a MOVIE. I know that sound ridiculous and I probably will be downvoted but it's just how I feel. Don't get me wrong, I LOVED The Avengers, but throughout my life I wanted to see the characters that I grew up with put into a motion picture. Unfortunately, It just felt like an entertaining but shallow action film. I wanted more, I wanted a more 'cinematic' feel and look to it, and now I think that Joss Whedon has implemented this 'feel' into AoU, just judging by the 3 trailers. You get me  Edit: http://redd.it/2gxnax   This guy knows what I am talking about, haha I just found this.      One of my biggest gripes with the first Avengers is that is wasn't cinematic enough. To me, it just didn't have that feel. From what I've seen as far as trailers go, I think the film has a much more 'cinematic' vibe to it. I can't say for sure, as I have not seen it yet. I hope it does turn out to be like that, as I believe that's how superhero movies SHOULD feel. Anyone else feel the same way? I would love the discuss this further. :)   So happy to hear that. I've actaully played a little bit of unity, the combat was great, as were the costumes, weapon selection and world design. I think it's worth getting just for those things alone. I've heard bad things about the missions and the story and lots of bugs.   I understand what it is like to lose someone close to you. That feeling of dread as the day they passed away on comes around. I've heard mixed things about Unity, I was thinking of giving it a chance as well. I hope you make it through the next week okay, like I said, PM me whenever. I will listen to anything you have to say.   Totally, talk to to me about anything. I used to play PC, my rig was soooo shit (i played on intel HD graphics). I played games like far cry 2 (one of my all time favs), skyrim, mark of the ninja, counter strike, the first assassins creed( again one of my favs). just games like that really, buuuuut i recently got a PS4, what an upgrade right? It's been great, i've just loaded up on games like gta 5, AC black flag, watch dogs and far cry 4. some of them are a little too disturbing for my taste (watch dogs) by i enjoyed all of them.  when you do finish work and go to the gamestore etc just have a think about the things we've been talking about previously, that should help a little.    Nice to hear! It feels good to be helping a person out like this, i am soo glad you are actually determined about making a change. Huskys are beautiful creatures. I never mentioned, i loved video games as well, feel free to talk to me about them. If your co workers are like that then yeah I do understand your situation, at least you have your cousin, family can be friends as well. Insurgent? not bad at all. summer (in america) is coming up so that's when all the awesome movies come out, like i cannot wait for Avengers age of ultron.   If you don't mind, every few days i would like to PM you just to see how you are doing.   I am so happy that this is getting you to think. Please tell me what you want to do after your shift. Dogs are great, I recommend you look into that.  As for your coworkers, I see the problem. I think you can still form friendships among them, even if your interests are different. You strike up small talk and just go from there. Are they friendly? I find that talking about recent news, world events etc works a lot of the time, as most people are interested in these things.  Most of all I think you need time to yourself. I mean like taking a day off work as I mentioned or doing alternative things after work like going to the park, beach etc these things can help more than you think; just some peaceful time for self reflection. If you do end up watching the films I recommended please tell me what you think of them and if they impacted/affected you in any way.   Hmmmm yeah you really need to watch those movies I recommended. Fight Club changed me as a person, as did American Beauty, as both of the main characters in those films were just like me a few years ago and little bit like you too. If I changed, I believe you can too.  You said you have a full time job. Why not start looking for friends there? Or maybe a girlfriend.   As for the drive home, eat dinner, bed at 10 thing, you really need to change that, as I can see that's part of what's dragging you down. Who told you that you HAVE to go to bed at 10? Who ever said you HAVE to go to work? Or even come home from work? Just take the day off one day, go to the park or beach or movies, just have a day to yourself. Pick a sunny, BEAUTIFUL day. Also, how about a pet? Dogs can be best, BEST friends. They can cheer you up, you can take them for walk, talk to them etc. You don't have to do the exact same crap everyday, no one ever said you did. We were put on this earth to live, you feel the emotions embedded in us, not be prisoners unto ourselves, and not to waste away our days. Is that how you want to remember your life? Doing the same things everyday?   I just re-read your post, I apologize for talking so much about myself; I feel like a dick. Here's me all Mr self-improved talking about my life and my happiness. I really do want to help you, I know that feeling, that feeling of just withering away slowly.    I know exactly how you feel.   I used to be like you.  I recommend you watch [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipe6CMvW0Dg)  I keep happy using these 3 principles:  **1. (The most important IMO) Lotsa good movies, books, music and T.v shows**  That's right. I mentally deteriorate if I don't get good entertainment. It's important to me, it is what I value. I try to go to the movies as often as possible and I collect blurays and try to watch a movie a day. I also listen to a wide variety of music. Good music, not shit. This includes Elton John, Pink Floyd, ELO, Queen, David Bowie etc. Good books do the job as well. I LOVE Stephen King and I LOVE batman comics. That's just me. It's things like this that make us human.  **2. FRIENDS!**  You NEED people to talk to, it is an absolute necessity. And remember, it's QUALITY not QUANTITY. I have a medium-ish circle of friends who I am all close to, and they love me and I love them! If you are having a shitty day then you can ALWAYS talk to a friend about it, they will always listen, and that can help more than you may think.  **3 AN ESTABLISHED WAY OF SEEING THE WORLD THAT ISN'T NEGATIVE**  You need to know where are are and what you are. That may sound stupid, but you need to embrace everything. You are a living organism. We were not created by a superhuman being or whatever, unfortunately we won't find out until the day we die. But until that day we need to LIVE. Don't waste away your time, you are a human being for christ sake!! MAKE YOUR MARK ON THIS EARTH, you will only live once!! You need to have your own way of seeing things that isn't overly pessimistic or optimistic. I am a little bit in between. Also, try not to worry to much. I know a few people who let things like world hunger, poverty, terrorist attacks etc get to them, and I can see how much it drags them down. Don't let that terrible stuff get in your way!!! The way I see it, it's all background noise, unless it comes to me, which it never does.  Anyway, enough about me. Tell me about you. I really do want to help you out, and I will try my best.  Also, watch the following films (they helped me):  American Beauty (1999)  Birdman (2014)  Fight Club (1999)   Silver Linings Playbook (2012)  Hope this helped, please respond!!           I misunderstood what you were saying when you said that it reminded you of the painter. I thought it was a condescending insult.  So what if people circlejerk? As soon as a talented director, actor etc starts being praised by a number of people they just accuse them of circlejerking.    I would genuinely find that interesting, thank you.   So your comparing my drawing (which was a VERY quick sketch btw) to that of a down syndrome painter?  Also, why did you tell me to shut up in the first place? Do people discussing cinematography usually piss you off?   I love SoS, have you heard the Alchemy Live version? It's like the original except on steroids.   ???   If I made a list, that film would be on it alright.   This is actually making me laugh. Come one dude, you started this, and to be honest I don't want this to go on any further.   Also, would a 9 or 10 year old draw inspiration from artists such as Tim Burton and Ralph Steadman to draw a character from a **PAUL THOMAS ANDERSON FILM?**    I've just been looking through your profile. How old are you?   Apocalypse Now, The Godfather I   II, The Last Emporer and The Conformist are fucking amazing.      I see what you mean.    *reincarnation   As is Skyfall and most of Deakins' other films, including Unbroken.   Also, which ones do you think match a film **perfectly**?   His upcoming film the revenant, may just be it. I don't see any oscar caliber perfomances in the months to come, but what can I say? I haven't seen all the films this year but the only oscar territory perfomances I can see coming up so far are Michael Fassbender as Steve Jobs and Leo as Hugh Glass in 'The Revenant' (did you see the image they release of him!? JESUS he looks intense)   Range? That's ok, I understand what you mean.   But if you want to see range from him just watch What's Eating Gilbert Grape.   2007.  No Country for Old Men   Zodiac  There Will be blood  And countless others, I would be here forever.   We got Drive in 2011...   Why's that?    He's just cruisin' along.   Personally, I enjoyed the first. The second? Not so much. To me the second volume was Von Trier's typical pessimistic style of film making and to a degree the first volume as well. But the ending to the 2nd volume really bothered me. As I stated before, It is a very pessimistic film. You are basically watching a character on a downward spiral, but the 2nd volume just went full Von Trier-hate the world mode, and I did not appreciate it.  Back to the first volume. Like I said, I genuinely enjoyed the first film. Although I would not watch it again, it was probably the most realistic you can get when covering that subject matter, and it didn't go over the top with it. Now you're probably think to yourself 'well, yes it did. Just look at the sex scenes!'. But the thing is, like I said, this is the most **realistic** take on this subject matter as you can get. And so while the graphic and sometimes unwatchable sex scenes are pretty intense, they are not over the top and gratuitous; they are simply realistic.  Anyway, that's my thoughts on the film. Please don't downvote! There is no need to as these are just my opinions. Yes I know my grammar is all over the place; I am not much of a writer. I would love to here your thoughts on the films, like I said, please don't downvote if you disagree just post your argument in the comments and I will be happy to discuss :)   thank you for that...    I know :'(    Michael Keaton in Birdman or The Unex- no         Interstellar  Moon  Interstellar  Moon   State of Play I thought was underrated.   *Extinction.    Yes, this will dominate the oscars.   Given the fact that Skyfall was one of the best Bonds in recent memory, how do you think they will top it?   I would love to hear your skepticism or excitement for this film!  edit: why am I being downvoted?   Is that a Dark Knight reference?   For what purpose did he sacrifice everything to become a whistleblower?   Please keep this EXTREMELY basic but please do include specific examples. Thanks!   The Revenant may be it...         Ohhh I thought it was the complete opposite    Yes I have   What is this subreddit actually about? Apparently you guys don't like Chris Nolan films.. What's with the Michael Bay Nazi thing? The drive jacket on the top left corner? What's wrong with DiCaprio? Marvel? Moon? SOMEONE PLS EXPLAIN!   This whole subreddit is about posting stills from movies...  	137
 Definitely agree with you here.  I hate Milwaukee in winter. But I have traveled to a lot of places in the world and Milwaukee in summer is somehow still near the top of my favorite cities somehow.   Reminds me of OkpoLand in South Korea.  Completely abandoned amusement park and spa.  Creeeeepy.   God hates f_gs.   Hmm...I bet not many people bought an I as there vowel...   Don't take this away from me!   Did you two discuss his enormous penis?  That is the type of question I would ask at least...   nor halal...         MCA2142 FIGHTING!!!   Vienna, Austria is pretty epic.  I was there a couple years ago for new years, and it was pretty crazy.  They legalize fireworks in the city limits fo the night.  It is seriously like a war zone. Pretty fun.  And Vienna is awesome to begin with.   I met a girl while teaching in South Korea who had graduated from there.  She was something else...   op own'd   Viking Fan in the Ill-Mill...Despise the Packers.  Lived in Wisconsin my whole life.   Mcnutt in the 3rd.  he's gunna be a stud.   Comet Cafe on Farwell is phenomenal.  So...much...bacon.   This is soo awesome.  Jealous of these fellas.          Too cute, I gotta get otter here!   Bogan cat   Sunburst sucks dick.  My parents live in Kewaskum and its and its an incredibly overrated park.  	21
 Ha I haven't either but considering I cry during half of Modern Family's episodes I'm sure I'd bawl. I get teary eyed pretty easily.    It's not silly. Without context, "Don't Mess with Texas" sounds just like that when you aren't directly exposed to the message of the motto.    Life of Joseph W. McVay as others have said but also check out Guerilla Maab 'Rise' - it's one of my favorite hip hop albums. Guerilla Maab was the 'rap group' he was in with Trae (the Truth) and their cousin Dougie D (currently serving life in prison I belive) before they both went solo.   OK that's what I figured you were saying. And I agree, we can't lose to Portugal, a tie wouldn't be ideal but at least we'd have the goal differential buffer for our game against Germany while they'd still have to beat Ghana (assuming Ghana loses to Germany).   Clarification, you're saying we will only be competing with Portugal to get out of the group stage, or we aren't going to be competing with Ghana because they're going to get out of the group stage for sure?   I don't really see how this is even a discussion. Unless for some reason he thinks we can compete with Germany for the 1 seed? Ideal outcome for the weekend - Germany wins vs. Ghana, US wins vs. Portugal. That gives both the US and Germany 6 points putting both teams through. If Ghana beats Germany and we beat Portugal then, like you said, there are 3 teams vying for 2 spots in the last game instead of 2 teams in (assuming US and Germany W).   Better to have 49 quarters than 2 quarters.     I don't really see how that would be all that beneficial. The more intersecting thoroughfares you have, the more 4-way stops and stop lights you need - this is bad.  I think the solution will be more 'science' than 'structure'. Mandated staggered business hours to lighten the rush that is rush hour, better light timing, emphasis on, implantation of and general acceptance and use of quality mass transit, better pedestrian options, better driving culture, the rise of driverless cars, etc.  Many small, subtle changes can add up to very noticeable gains.    Of course, it would require us to sacrifice certain quaint values about quiet, empty suburban streets, but oh well. This is Houston. The city proper. If you want quiet suburban streets, move to Katy.  And no, I don't want to sacrifice the small amount of pedestrian friendly areas for something that there is no basis or evidence that it works. (unless there is which I'd be interested in reading)  Buy up houses that are in the way via eminent domain, bulldoze them, and build connections in there place. This would help immensely with traffic at a fraction of the price of building new highways.  Easy to say until your house is on the chopping block. Also, this would not be cheap. Imminent domain acquisition is expensive and time consuming. Roads aren't cheap. Bridges aren't cheap. Restructuring intersections (where do we add stop lights? where do we add stop signs? where do we create 4 way stops?) to take on the added weight of new thoroughfare traffic can't be easy.   his inner circle  Melisandre and Davos?   Since when is it not OK to cry when you watch The Notebook? Thought that was a requirement.   It's hard ya know. Rockets were probably the second most criticized franchise this past season, with these same types of comments appear  over and over. Rockets fans are human and sometimes it gets to us. I try not to let it get to me but I'll be honest, sometimes it does and sometimes I miss when the Rockets were everyone's favorite little team a couple seasons ago.   I guess that's what happens when you acquire devisive superstars.    For when your primary logo gets injured.   There goes my 20 bucks. Thanks a lot Rocket's design team.   you tell 'em patty!   *especially* beard-seconds    Not really, it was where he tried, and failed, to return to power after being exiled from France. Attempting to invade Russia is what effed up Napolean's conquest of Europe.    Friends who want to see you cream or ice cream; choose one.   The Guardian is the OG.   annnnnnd he's gone   Yeah but quality chocolate sprinkles make mediocre ice cream better.   I heard they're working on their fusion dance. Hopefully it's ready by the start of the season.   Schaub didn't until last year either. 10 interceptions returned for touchdowns confirmed.  Fitzmagic: "now we're driving, now they're driving"   That was the joke.   We've got the Summer Olympics for that, as well as when the Heat play the Spurs in the NBA Finals.  (but I know what you mean)   A couple decades was the amount of time it took to go from the first production of the V2 rocket to the first man in orbit. 20 years is a long time. Obviously dominoes need to fall in place: the right people have to be born; and the right system has to be in place with the support of mentors, coaches, facilities and culture. To act like it's unfeasible is just pessimistic shortsightedness. Obviously it's arrogance to think that it *will happen* because *America*, but it's nothing more than optimism to hope for it to happen.   snap   "I deserve to only see things which I think are funny and which I think aren't annoying"  -almost everyone in this thread   I like how the website is smh.  shakin my head   I think he started loving Houston before HOuston started loving him, that's the thing. He's always repped Houston. He considers himself primarily mentored by Houston rappers. He threw a freaking week of appreciation for the city.  Yah, I can get down with Drake. Anyone who recognizes the greatness of Houston who isn't from here is a good dude in my book.   Why? He's from Canada, but has a tattoo representing his love for the city. He reps us hard. He considers us his second home. He loves Houston and considers himself a "Houston-mentored rapper". You should love the fact that someone with the pull of Drake reps so hard for a town he has no roots in. He gives us more national exposure than most of our homegrown guys (Bun B excluded - DJ Screw is legend status but outside of Houston and HH he is non-existent - Mike Jones was a cruel joke - Z-Ro, KeKe, ESG, wreckshop family, etc. all have in-state pull but that's about it).  Happy Delayed Drake Day!   He still graduated high school. It's on his transcript. They just aren't giving him the piece of paper that says he's a graduate of their school, but he is. A job/internship/school isn't going to ask to see your diploma ever.    I think FIFA has 3-4 backup countries that can host on the fly. USA, England, Germany, maybe France. It's a lot more than just stadiums.    my mom's a fat whore but she isn't that fat of a whore.   that was fun!   My go to is Knob Creek. At bars I'll either go for Knob Creek or Bulleit if they have neither I'll go to Makers.   Bulleit Rye is also really good. Kind of a middle ground between bourbon and scotch.   How?   Atenas, alajuela    How are they basically indentured servants or serfs?   Oh Jesus fucking Christ. The dark ages? Reddit takes hyperbole to a whole other level. In my experience, the restaurant experience in the US is better than most "enlightened" countries.   You got 20 in metric, in imperial it's closer to 4.    :p truth     Nah no typo. Just rains more during rainy season but rains year round.    Nah, it really only rains for an hour max every day. Rest of the time it's blue skies and white clouds. So basically really concentrated verse England just being gloomy and wetish all the time.   Really great weather. I actually lived in the town Nat Geo claimed best weather in the world in like 1990 or something.    You can get a refurbished by Nintendo console + pad + game for $200.   I was talking about Central America :D  lived in Costa Rice for a year  see: my flair   I think I was being sarcastic. I think.   I don't really support it; I can't support it seeing as how I'm not a constituent of Louisiana. I'm just trying to rationalize it. Every issue deserves more than one point of view. It's important to see something you don't agree with and try to rationalize it without your opinions in view.  But I'm a bitch and a fool so what do I know.   with 16 what?   It's not a shock if you ever lived there. There are two seasons, rainy season and non-rainy season. It rains every day during non-rainy season.  It's nice rain though, usually in the afternoon, usually pretty hard for maybe an hour or so.  Laying under your tin roof during one of those rain storms is just the perfect nap time. Then the sun comes out, and the weather is perfect the rest of the time.   Which is odd because I'm pretty sure Mexico took the obesity crown from us a few years ago.   What's the irony?    There's a hilarious bit in the new HBO show Silicon Valley, centered around Burger King and Cicadas. Highly recommend the show.   Mine was off by default. I also rarely see spotify updates from other people on Facebook, so I'm guessing that's true across the board.    There's a check box in preferences "update Facebook timeline when new music plays", it's not difficult to figure out.    The height of ignorance.    I fucking dare you to actually read the bill and not base your response off of a title/horribly editorialized article.   C'mon bitch, I dare you. Do it.    Maybe in response to the bonanza of 'loss of income' claims levied after deep water, which BP was pretty much just accepting without any actual trial. This concentrates the judicial power of the state into one entity. Now the small municipality who sees a cash cow can't just file a lawsuit and pad it's pockets.  I think the bit about any monies received must be used for wetlands protection supports this.  Anyways, truth probably lies somewhere in the middle and once again a lot of people are gonna be wholly misinformed because OP is wholly misinformed.    But it's not good.    maybe the 25th and 2 second rounders. No way Morey trades 3 first round picks.   I think Rondo is 2nd on Morey's want list after Love.  Go for Love, if you can't get Love swing a deal for Rondo.   Would Lin be a bench player on the Knicks? Would Asik?  I can't see Lin coming off the bench and Asik versus Chandler would be an interesting position battle.   Dwight made 10 other dude's change teams because he was scared of the bright lights of LA. What a jerk.   stop socializing with me bro   How so?   downboated   Can't you hide all notifications from certain apps? I remember doing that with Farmville way back in the day.   I love the social aspect of Spotify. Seeing what your friends are listening to in the desktop app, being able to share music easily, etc.   It's off by default I'm pretty sure. I never turned mine off and it isn't activated.   You know you can turn that off, right?   I never said they're the best just that they have the highest top speed.   I'm dumb dude, you said so yourself. How could you expect a coherent sentence?    Cool. Good thing it was posted today too cuz I missed it yesterday.   You pegged me bro. I'm *that* dumb. I now to your obvious overwhelming intelligence.    The lighter characters have the lowest top speed though.   I mean, I get that, but like, being official is pretty important for a lot of things.   That's his point?  Klinnsman was hired on his credentials. Klinnsman slams Kobe for being extended on his credentials. Wilbon slams Klinnsman for hypocrisy.    That was his point though. He got a contract to be coach based on his past actions, then he went and criticized Kobe Bryant for getting a contract based on his past actions.  He conveyed the point with absolutely no tact but I think that was what he was saying.   Michael Wilbon is a sports writer too.   He's an American but he isn't a citizen?    If you're not first, you're last.   They were tied, Ronaldo scored shortly after this in stoppage time.  Then he got fired.  Worth it?   Be worse at FIFA bro   If I remember correctly Ronaldo promptly scored after this. Pretty sure it was in stoppage time or close to 90 minutes.  So no, probably not worth it. They lost, he lost his job, he probably fired up Ronaldo which resulted in the goal.  Ivan the Idiot.   Jesus shut the fuck up. Pedophilia charges? Lol. She is most likely 18 and even if she was 17 it would still be legal in the state of Texas.  Learn to not be dumb.      She is probably my least favorite casting on the show so far. I think the actress who played Ros would have been absolutely perfect for Shae and would have been a much better match personality wise with Tyrion. In that universe I wouldn't mind her taking the place of Penny. Gonna be interesting casting Penny though, are there any female dwarf actresses?   Huh. I'm sorry, were you expecting resolution in book 5 of, a minimum, 7 book series?   Fair enough. Sorry for making you read my faggotry.   "I don't spend..."  I probably spend an hour a day on the internet these days.     Smurflogik, internet historian.   i did make an edit to amend my comment to not include smurflogik.  i could go into a majority of comment sections for posts on the front page, paste that onto one of the repost comments and it would be relevant.   Cool, did you like your new house?   you have an exceptional memory, i must admit   yeah see edit   How do you remember the exact year you saw that? You sure it wasn't 2002 or 2006?   See man, that's what you people just don't fucking get. I don't spend 15 hours a day on the internet but I see my fair share, and I've managed to never see this. You might have seen it 15 times, but this was my first.  Sometimes shit just slips through the cracks and you miss something. The simple enormity of the internet and all the content within is impossible for a single person to completely digest in *their lifetime* let alone the relative short amount of time that the internet has been churning out this content.  With that in mind, try to visualize all the stuff that you see for the first time that someone else has seen 15 times. Imagine trying to talk about it and the conversation revolves around the fact that it's "*a fuckin repost man*"  It's annoying. If you have seen something a billion times, what force drives you to go into the comments to let people know that you've seen it before?  I just picture you people in the real world, listening to someone tell a story that you'd already heard before.  "So there I was, sitting on the bench minding my own business when out of nowhe..."  "Dude, wtf, repost! you told this story already."  "Oh ya I did tell you! Sorry mate, but Patricia here hasn't heard it so I'm gonna keep going."  "Fuck Patricia, provide new content and stop being such a story whore"  "Fine... So there I was, sitting on the camel, minding my own busine..."  Patricia speaks up, "I've heard this, one stop telling it!"  e: i mean you're pretty chill about it but damn it's annoying when people act like they're above the repost     Yeah when I was talking about vicinity to the light rail I meant Midtown. I do walk from the rail to my apt in montrose (Westheimer and Montrose abouts) every day after work and I don't think it's far (though it's starting to turn into a sweaty walk). I walk wayyyyy more than the average Houstonian to be fair.  There are a few bus routes that will take you there a lot quicker but I prefer the walk after work; gets my blood pumping a little.   Midtown sounds ideal, shouldn't be too difficult to find a place for $1,000, though might be a little more for the "perfect" spot. There are plenty of places that are pet friendly, but be prepared to pay an extra deposit for large breed. Midtown's population is predominantly young business types between 24-35, has quality night life, is about as central as you can get, it's close to downtown and the light rail (though fairly limited use depending on where your office is located).  Might also want to check out Montrose, there's a ton of large complexes going up and being finished right now. Montrose is just south of Midtown for an idea of the area.  The place you have in your post is pretty much right in between the two (Saint Danes is a great bar if you end up there - only a couple blocks away - and they're dog friendly).   Spirited Away is playing at River Oaks Theater, Friday and Saturday starting about midnight.   Natural flavors: strawberries, chocolate, lemons, grass, rocks, etc. etc.    /r/im14andohnowigetit   That was much closer in history than a hundred years ago. Our average precipitation is still 48" and we average over 100 days of rainfall per year.  The past 4-5 years of dry have jogged the memory a bit I think.    I'll tell someone I like their new Nikes - like Mikes - though that is traditionally reserved for 'street/urban shoes' such as AF1s, Air Max's, Dunks, etc. etc.. But for the most part yeah it's Nike like Mikey.  Nikes like Mikes is pretty much only for sneakerhead type shoes.      Sorry but that HEB is not only a better grocery store, but also a much better looking building and space. Love that they kept the big oak tree up in the parking lot. The high rise that's going up where fiesta once stood... now that is another matter.  Not really sure what would satisfy you if you can't find a bar in montrose that caters to your type of people. Yuppie bars, bro bars, hipster bars, gay bars, dive bars, cocktail bars, etc. etc., pick your poison. Also still an abundance of smaller retail outlets (which are seemingly popping up faster than your chains).     But that's only because it's big... Per capita is not an important metric when talking about immigration. You can't say, "if Germany had the same population as the US, it's immigration numbers would reflect that increase".    mural: a painting or other work of art executed directly on a wall  checks out.    	107
                            Wow, you don't see CDs everyday   There is an old joke that goes "How do you know when a ______ (redneck, hippie etc) is on her period?"

Can you actually refute any of the facts presented in the article?  ?????????   Looks like a lot of padding going on in there.    Can you actually refute any of the facts presented in the article?   Obama is the worst president America has ever had. He hates America and is a socialist.    http://i.imgur.com/mPYw7fP.jpg                                 I am beginning to think I stumbled into r/guns by mistake..     http://i.imgur.com/Eaz3lJC.jpg   http://i.imgur.com/Eaz3lJC.jpg   Please, please tell me you didn't think I was being serious? http://i.imgur.com/Eaz3lJC.jpg         The socialist elements of Naziism were purged in the Night of the Long Knives.  Communists yes but the Nazis were socialists and viewed Communists as competitors. Hitler did not like Communists because they were too internationally focused and had too many Jews as members.  Regardless of the rumors of the Nazi leadership's beliefs, they still had to mobilize the Christian German population.  How does mobilizing Christian support make the Nazis Christian?  The reasons for choosing Jews as the scapegoat are probably complex, but antisemitism has a long history in Europe, and its almost undeniably religious in origin.  Antisemitism has a long history, there is no evidence that the Nazis were influenced into antisemitism by any Christian doctrine.        Both of those things were true of the Nazis. Can you offer ANY proof to the contrary? Please provide historical evidence.   A lot of people have that opinion, or at least that their motives are hardly in line with any popular interpretation of Islam. I could say they are to Muslim extremism what the Nazi party was to Christian extremism.   ISIS is motivated 100% by extremist Muslim views. The Nazis were socialists and  atheists and were not influenced by the Christian religion at all.   Perhaps the military budget is being cut because drones are supplanting many of the roles our military has been serving in the region.   How can you suggest that? Drones are great as an adjunct tool to combat terrorists and I support their use but they are not replacements for a strong and supported military. Obama has pursued huge cuts in the military and pursued policies that have allowed ISIS to expand and the losses of Libya, Yemen, and most of Iraq and Syria to Muslim extremists.    I can confirm that there are lots of attorneys who are psychopaths     He was facing re-election in 2011. The Patriot Act via the NSA gave Obama useful tools unrelated to anti terror goals.   What is your point on Muslim extremism?  Obama won't even admit that Muslim extremism even exists. How do you explain that fact? Obama claims ISIS is not motivated by religion. What?      Interventionist strong military  He has cut the military's budget drastically. How effective has he been regarding Libya, Iraq, ISIS, Syria, Iran, Afghanistan, Yemen, Boko Harum etc etc etc? Other than drones, how could  you even claim Obama favors the military or is interventionist?  continuation of Bush domestic terror policies  See above  more money on the border  Huh? Do you realize he has directed ICE and Homeland Security to open the borders? Remember all of the refugees from central America?  Guantanamo is still open   Many prisoners have been released and returned to Jihad   taxes weren't raised  Ever hear of Obamacare?  the deficit is lower  Hahahahahahahaha. thanks, I needed a good laugh!   Although he voted to extend the act it was a political move. His actions and policies regarding boarder security and failure to even admit Muslim extremism exists shows his security policy views in action.      Can you name a single policy he supports that is center-right?      100% of Obama's policies are Leftist. Can you name a single Conservative policy he supports?                            Actually, the Nazis were socialists. Are you suggesting that Cheney is a socialist?                     Pituitary glands are a bitch.   Huh?   I do not accept your claims. The facts don't support you. Also the EU is a very different place with a very different economy than the US. US military spending in Europe and dependance on German loans to name a few examples.   Very few poor people are hiring these days. Like it or not, wealth is necessary to create jobs in the amounts needed to increase employment. Can you please explain how the recent government stimulus helped anyone except political allies of Mr Obama? Did the middle class gain anything?   Except government does not give $500 tax credits. Instead, government stimulus involves large payments to political allies such as union building projects. Very few industries benefit as a result to the extent that it warrants expansion.   Supply side economics views tax cuts and regulatory relief as tools that stimulate industries because they know their fixed costs will be less and predictable. This stimulates them to expand to both capture a larger market share of existing markets and expand into new markets.   The fact is that Keynesian economic models only stimulate limited parts of the economy and do so for very limited periods. Businesses are unlikely to invest capital to expand when they know that government stimulus is temporary.      SHORT RUN during recessions that money spent by govt may stimulate the economy.  Yet that never happens.  Industry does not invest capital and expand based on an anticipated short run boost of public sector spending. They know that such a boost will be tiny and very temporary.    I did it my way (until I broke my hip)   I await your economics explanation as to why I am wrong. Until then you offer nothing to the conversation.   I agree that the possibility for abuse could be high. As a purely economic business model, a special status membership level, a "Reddit Platinum" membership which required members to pay $10 per month would possibly make Reddit lots of cash. Such a deal might hurt Reddit if it drove membership away though.       There is no such thing as trickle down economics or voodoo economics.   Supply side economics in a nutshell is the belief that making industry cheaper via less regulation and lower taxes stimulates expansion and increased hiring.   Keynesian (aka Liberal) economics  in a nutshell is the belief that public spending stimulates expansion and increased hiring.   Both theories are based on the belief that giving cash to either the public or private sector will improve the economy.   If one is against supply side economics then they must also be against Keynesian economics.  Both are "trickle down" economic models                               I estimate 2 million per box                                                             I don't care about some religious leader's opinions on another religion's beliefs.

Clearly though, the number of rapes committed by allied soldiers were perpetrated by a tiny minority. The rapes committed by the soviets were widespread and systematic. They were part of a policy of revenge. The two allied side's rape histories during WWII cannot be considered equal    Can you offer any proof of that? The Soviet rape and pillaging have been well documented.   As the war ended, not all allies responded to German civilians equally. American, French, and English troops were respectful for the most part. Russian troops on the other hand engaged in a massive campaign of revenge rape on any German female found regardless of age.     "Sweep the leg Johnny"   Republicans are not anti science. Republicans are anti politicization of science such as not believing in phoney climate change taxation schemes.    I think anyone who does not vaccinate their kids is crazy or misinformed. The media seems to want to make the anti vaccination issue as somehow part of the false claim that the GOP is anti science. I was merely showing that the issue is not politically based.    Historically, socialism has caused  the deaths of over one hundred  million innocent people over the past century. Enforcement of socialist policies by socialist governments has required the use of terror and violence.     If you were taught that socialism has been a success then your teachers have been teaching political indoctrination and not history.  All one has to do is compare western style representative governments with socialist governments to see which system is superior in terms of improving the human condition and human life.  Just honestly compare the facts.   Thank you for responding. I suspected you were young because of your previous comments. As a student of history with college/university several degrees, I encourage you to continue your education. History is a fascinating subject as it offers a clue of what we can expect of the future. That clue only exists though if we search for facts and not political indoctrination.  The study of socialism is an interesting field but one that is rife with political falsehoods. If that aspect of history interests you then you should pursue it further with an eye towards avoiding non factual political influences.  Socialism has failed miserably wherever it has been tried. As an Aussie, you should honestly compare the histories of socialist states with your own productive and fair society.    Nic, does it ever get tiring having to filter your reports through a PC filter rather than just reporting what you see?    I am curious, what level of education have you achieved? I am not asking  to mock you.   haha what? Mussolini and Hitler were facists, the exact opposite of communists.  Hitler and Mussolini were fascists AND socialists. Fascism and Naziism were forms of socialism. Nether were Communists and both viewed Communists as socialist rivals.  Pol Pot was not a marxist  He was a socialist though   He (Castro) liberated Cuba from a dictator and now Cubans enjoy a higher standard of living and longer life expectancy than any country in south and central America.  Then why are so many Cubans risking their lives to escape Cuba? Why does Cuba need a secret police or political prisons? Why are Cubans prevented from freely associating, protesting, and traveling out of the country?  Mao was an interesting guy, but I'm curious why you would think he is bad?  Please look up Mao's "cultural revolution" and other socialist policies  http://necrometrics.com/20c5m.htm#Mao   Socialism is a system that looks good on paper but always fails in practice because ultimately, the state must use coercion and violence to force everyone to comply. The Soviets had to use violence and starvation to enforce compliance to socialist policies, Mao had to kill millions in his cultural revolution to enforce compliance to socialist policies, the killing fields of Cambodia was likewise a policy of purifying society by eliminating those who opposed Pol Pot's socialist paradise.  The bottom line is that socialist systems use violence to eliminate any counter revolutionary individuals or populations that may oppose them.    Forced collectivization in the Soviet Union under Stalin.  The killing fields under Pol Pot  Mao's cultural revolutions     Those deaths were directly related to the implementation and enforcement of socialist policies. In other words, if Germany, Italy, Russia, Cuba, Cambodia had been ruled by democracies or representative governments then the vast majority of those deaths would have been averted.     I define socialism as a political/economic system characterized by a planned economy, non private control over the means (and distribution) of production , and a government/community centric society at the  expense of individual liberty.  That definition encompasses the Soviets, the Maoists, the Nazis, and the Fascists. Each form of socialism has its unique qualities but they all retain the same core elements.    Actually, 100 million people died as a direct result of socialist policies or because they opposed socialist policies. They didn't all just commit suicide did they?    http://www.nationalreview.com/article/372197/nazis-still-socialists-jonah-goldberg   They were still all socialists   Stalin was a socialist  Mao was a socialist  Castro was a socialist  Pol Pot was a socialist  Hitler was a socialist  Mussolini was a socialist  All together they are responsible for the deaths of over 100 million people over the past century.  Maybe socialism IS bad   The theory behind these weird speed limit signs such as this one is that drivers would ignore a speed limit sign with a common low MPH limit such as 20MPH but that 9 1/2 MPH is so odd that drivers would actually notice and respond compliantly.    If you read Marx and Engels, you will see that socialism is a transitional phase of government that precedes Communism.   In other words, socialism is a preliminary step that societies evolve through after they pass from agrarian systems, to industrial/capitalist systems, and ultimately into Communism. It is only during the final Communism stage that society evolves into a state were non private ownership of the means of production is complete.   by definition having the cronies of government own and control all the means of production is fascism.   Socialist systems merely have to have non private control over the means of production. Control does not require outright ownership of the means of production.  Socialism allows  keeping some industries in private hands during the transitional phase from capitalism to communism but those private hands are ultimately controlled by the government.  Again, Marx wrote that socialism  is a continuum. It is an evolutionary process that societies travel through from serfdom through capitalism and ultimately communism.      I stand ready to debate you with historical facts and proof. You only want to slink away in defeat.   You obviously want to quit because you know that your claims are false.   I deal in facts, You deal in faith.    Sorry but your collection of pictures are not Tea Party related. Only one picture has a tea party flag. None of the other pictures provide any proof that they are from Tea Party events or created by the Tea Party or its members. Many of the signs aren't even racist. If the Tea Party is as racist as you claim then there should be countless examples of Tea Party racism. Such examples simply do not exist.  For the record, the Tea Party stands for three things: Lower taxes, less government, less regulation. That's it. Racism has nothing what so ever to do with the Tea Party. As you will see, the Tea Party will continue to oppose any Progressive policies regardless of the race of the Democrat who proposes them.  As for the Nazis and the Fascists, both movements were forms of socialism.  Hitler and Mussolini were both ardent socialists. Both viewed their particular version of socialism as being superior to the various forms of socialism then offered. Hitler opposed Communism because he felt it was too slow, internationally focused and contained too many Jews.  You fail to consider in your analysis the facts that socialism does not require actual ownership of the means of production but can control the means of production via crony capitalism, regulation, and  favoritism. Both Nazis Germany and Fascist Italy exhibited all of the core elements of classical socialism such as a planned economy, control over the means (and distribution) of production, and a government centric community based society at the expense of individual liberty.    People often wrongly confuse Naziism and Fascism as being right wing movements. That claim only makes sense if one's political spectrum is made up of only socialistic movements.   Please read this article as it lays out the historical facts that the Nazis and the Fascists were indeed true and actual practicing socialists.  http://www.nationalreview.com/article/372197/nazis-still-socialists-jonah-goldberg   Sorry but there is no proof of that. Simply photos.      Can you please explain when that happened?   How do these links involve the Tea Party? How do we know who these sign wavers are?  And regarding your other comment,  the Fascists and the Nazis were socialists    Tea Party is not racist at all.

 Not exactly. UV-A refers to UV closer to the blue spectrum while UV-B refers to wavelengths slightly shorter than the ones considered UV-A and UV-C is in between UV-B and X-ray I believe...wikipedia...http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultraviolet#Subtypes    What would be a theoretical time scale for something like this occurring? (not in real life, but if the gif were in years, how many?)   You'll get better at it as you go, so start with what you can manage, then do something else. As you work through it, what you can do will probably increase. Also, not knowing your major, you don't always need to read the whole article to understand what they're claiming and how they did it. This is a big time saver.  Also, organize your stuff. Whether it's Mendeley (my favorite), Endnote, ReadCube, or another program, don't just have a folder on your desktop or documents folder with PDFs floating around. You'll never be able to find anything or you'll take too much time organizing it for it to be effective.   I worked with the base uPrint model in grad school and we went off the service plan and there were a ton of issues. I replaced the print head, the chamber fans, the tips (this is more of a they need it eventually thing), and I've even taken the print head off and put it in an oven to get support material that leaked to soften enough so I could hit it with a hammer while it cooled so the thing would switch between the two heads.  When they work, they work great. When they don't, they're awful.  The thing that happened at the base is surprisingly common I would say. Also, the base plates are reusable. Completely. You can either dissolve the material off or take a chisel to it (carefully) and any material will pop off.   After spending lots of time on here (and time elsewhere such as Google) I've come up with nothing.   I'm looking for a 3D printer that can print in wax and ABS/PLA (not necessarily at the same time and not necessarily both ABS/PLA) for work. I know there are printers that will do one or the other, but I haven't found anything. I think the closest has been one of Stratasys's printers but those are ridiculously expensive and my experience in Graduate school left me jaded (Dimension uPrint).  Any help would be much appreciated   I had SolidWorks available to me in graduate school and would always add material properties to stuff until it looked the way I wanted and then I would have SolidWorks render the image in 3D and it always looked nice, but may not be as great for chemistry type figures   Here's a link to the abstract for anyone who wants it. I haven't been able to read the article yet, but will be doing so sometime today:  http://stm.sciencemag.org/content/7/273/273re1  Edit: Ok, so I read through the paper and it is interesting, and it does work quite well, but I'm a bit concerned that they're using 1 L of blood as their sample. The tests were compared with traditional tests and found results of sensitivity and specificity that ranged from 100%-77% and 91%-82%.  It seems like a good platform, and yes, current tests today may be less than $34 each, but the start up costs and training are what are the problems IMO. They also said that after clinical trials they were able to improve sensitivity by increasing the antibody spotting concentration on the gold nanoparticles, but that seems kind of obvious.   Title is definitely misleading   Is she wearing a bonnet as a strap guard?   As someone who just moved out of one of those cities and into one not on that list...I have made a terrible mistake   1984 First time ever. Also watched the movie.   Thanks for the review. I'm generally a fan of what they do, but recently it's been a bit of a struggle bus.  It's unfortunate this one didn't live up to their past work, especially V and The Matrix.  Guess I'll probably wait till Netflix or RedBox have it   Knowing people who did it and paid for more than I did (I had auto insurance/cell phone covered by parents cause it was convenient and didn't cost them much extra) it's quite possible.  Basically make your own food as much as possible and avoid going out, don't get TV; stick with Netflix, avoid movie theaters.  Traveling is kind of out of the picture, except maybe once per year as is new technology.  Also, live somewhere cheap.  I lived in Tucson where the $15K-$25K stipend is enough. If you pick a place like New York, it won't be and that'll be difficult.  	13

 HAHA Lemmings :P thats a decent point, shall be making nose smaller :)   Hey what about this do you think I'm joking about? Happy to answer any questions :)   This game looks great I can't wait to play it.   Haha yeah I always get mixed responses to my goofy art style, I've attempted to try something different and have posted it to the OP, lemme know what you think.   :P thanks, yeah these are concepts, not final versions :) the script will be proofed no worries :)   Ok fair call, might mess around with different art styles, see if I can use my limited skill with more efficacy.   Thanks for the feedback :)   - EDIT 2: Thankyou so much for all the feedback so far, I have revised the artstyle and altered the character design as people have suggested and this is where I am going: - https://i.imgur.com/navT2jf.jpg and http://i.imgur.com/bj0EeW5.jpg - More suggestions and feedback is welcome :) - ORIGINAL POST:  Any feedback on the artstyle or idea is appreciated, just be aware that any feedback may be taken into account in the project, which means anything you post here could be used/appropriated - so if you have any ideas you think are too brilliant to give away for free please keep em to yourself and make your own game because I'd love to play it :)  Concept Screens (alternative art style idea linked below):  https://i.imgur.com/N1LuEp7.png - http://i.imgur.com/zN3XUTM.png - [TW: physical threat] http://i.imgur.com/1w0WQ9C.png - http://i.imgur.com/Au1jLGa.png - http://i.imgur.com/Geija8m.png - Basically the game plays like a chose your own adventure/screen based game (maybe like visual novels? I dunno never played one), you have conversations with characters and decide where the plot goes by what the character does and what tale she ends up experiencing :)  I'm planning on having vastly different story threads depending on every choice you make, you could befriend someone or kill them :o - characters could betray you or you may never know their true motivations by the end.   Because there are going to be a lot of panels, I've chosen a simple artstyle. I may also include a QTE decision system for high pressure moments, but it won't be anything complex, because I don't like complex QTEs.  Would you play this kind of game?   Edit: wow! thanks for the comments, feedback and upvotes ^_^        "War... War has changed..." vs. "War... War never changes..." It's almost like Kojima wrote that line to challenge the inherent view of our culture's tendency to fetishize violence and revere warriors as mythic things instead of seeing them as people who are mistreated by those in power.   Nice observation! I like it. Good point.   Yeah it's kind of like Andy warhol, creating new art from pop culture.   I love how Kojima can use a wildly contrasting tone (camp 60's in this case) and still deliver a really serious and compelling criticism of war.  I love how MGS3 basically shows how soldiers are used and abused by governments for their own ends. There is no king and country bullshit here.  MGS is basically pop culture porn, but it is NOT war porn, something I appreciate greatly in the franchise and in a climate where MANY video games and even similar genres are playing up war as "cool" in a direct and shameless fashion - it's nice to see MGS actually having something to say about the shitty state of affairs our world has become.   sweet thanks!   I have two games in the works currently, the trailer for the first is a free one here (i took a break for a long while so ignore the release date lol)  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0rQxQik-zk  The one I'm writing atm on the side is a graphic choose your own adventure type thing. ^_^  How about you?   Twine sounds amazing, is it free to use even if you sell your game? I just need it for the "screenplay" so to speak, not the game making, which I'm doing in Construct 2   This looks cool!   Traditional script writing software has been fine for my linear stories but how do I legibly construct a non linear narrative with different endings? A story tree writing solution would be immensely helpful so any suggestions? Preferably free options :)      The Thing is a singleplayer game where any of your team could be infected at any moment and attack you. You have to maintain their trust and if you think someone is turning you have to make hard decisions IIRC. Great game, haven't played it in years though.   Not surprised by the American news shows introduction emphasizing the money he makes to legitimize his past time, because money is everything...  not...  He looks like he enjoys his profession and thats the main thing - being happy and not hurting anyone in the process :]     Wow love a new sci fi setting :)   Need to finish those Witcher books! Can't wait for this game.     	22

It's a small town a few kilometers away from my city...   Irina.   Thanks a lot! :D    [Here's one!](http://imgur.com/WC2DL7E)   Yes, that's what I might do today! Would you like to see one of the pictures I took?       Yeah, I was too bored and there was nothing to do :D   It did, but nothing much. But there was a bug no nice y and I think my whole colony must have gotten up as it was 12.30 Am xD   Nothing much, just riding and drove into a car which was parked XD   Just lying around. Feel down yesterday while riding a cycle, and my whole body hurts :(   So, what's up today?   Gary   Hey! I don't think I had any compliments :(   /r/androidcirclejerk   /r/Android   /r/Disney   /r/India   And CC, obviously. That's it.   Why??? Why can't just /u/Dakar-A create it?   No, what's it about?   iPhone 6   **ADMINS ADMINS ADMINS ADMINS ADMINS**  	113
 What was he supposed to do? Get out and challenge them to fisticuffs one at a time? What if he doesn't stand a chance at winning, or they gang up on him?  OK, so that's a bad idea. Well... drive away? Wait, they're surrounding me, I might bump into them. "Sorry Mr. Drunk Asshole, I'll put the car in park and let you ruin me financially and destroy my livelihood"  How about the third solution. Oh wait there isn't one. I guess we'll let violent people just walk all over us.  What's your solution exactly? I'd like to hear it.   I might be thinking of a different, similar video, but weren't these people charge with battery?   All you have to do is make more money of the DRM than you would have if you didn't include it. Let's simplify and say that including DRM has the following associated costs (we'll ignore 'brand damage', like people not buying future games, and other costs for simplicities sake):  -Development costs of the DRM: $500 -Lost sales due to customers disliking DRM: $250 -DLC sales lost from unhappy customers: $100 -People returning the game because DRM prevents if from playing: $100 Loss: $950  However, by preventing the game from being torrentable immediately, a small fraction of people who were on the fence about torrenting vs buying now cave in and buy the game. If these people's sales exceed $950, the DRM is worth it. Furthermore, the DRM might be developed for one game, but used for future games, meaning including it in future titles won't even cost the full $500.  Having said that, the data isn't usually as clear cut (hard to quantify gained sales vs lost sales for including DRM, for example). However, I think it's fair to say that these companies have some reasonable data supporting their decisions. I'm not entirely convinced that DRM is 'useless' like most people seem to think. It might be, but the mere fact that companies, with access to way more data about their products than us, are so adamant about using it leads me to believe that there must be some argument for it. Or maybe it is costing them money and they just don't have the data to realise it.  The point is, whether it's actually good or not isn't just a simple case of "people hate it" or "it'll get cracked anyway".  Another pro-DRM argument is maybe the technology is costing them money on products sold today. But maybe they're just using today's products as guinea pigs to make better DRM for a future generation.   Sad and lonely, sure. I think it's missing the 'crazy' criteria.   Insurance rates are determined by looking at your background and comparing it to statistical info to find a marketable price point that will yield the greatest profit (the goal of any product, really).  So if you have a heart condition, you are obviously more likely to require medical treatment for a heart condition, so it's a bigger risk to them to offer you insurance, hence it costs more. I'm sure you already knew that though.  Makes sense right?  Well, gender has been show to play a huge role in the number of accidents you have.  Men are more likely to be involved in dangerous car crashes, usually where the driver is at fault. However, these don't often result in insurance claims (I don't think?) and are not as numerous as small crashes. On the other hand, women are much more likely to be involved in small crashes that result in insurance payouts.  Hence, women are more expensive to provider coverage for.  I've seen a lot of people complain about this being unfair, but it makes sense to me. If you cover 100 men and 100 women on the same rates, the group of women is going to cost you a lot more.  (I'll just note by saying I've never read the studies this info is based on myself, but I've never heard anyone criticise them so I've always assumed they must be pretty solid and still up to date).   You're preaching to the choir.   Do homeopaths believe that you can get drunk off a single drop of alcohol in a glass of water? Also does it have to be water? Could I dilute medicine inside milk?  Or vice versa, could I put a drop of milk into water and 'increase' the amount of fats/protein/etc my body gets out of it? Or does it only work with curing things?  Finally, only liquids? Or can I put one part of say, sleeping gas, inside a bag with a ton of 'regular air' and knock myself out?  Basically, what decides what can be diluted and still effective and what can't?  (No, I'm not suggesting homeopathy actually works. I know it's quack medicine. I'm just more interested in what THEY believe).   He's probably a virgin.   I think I was one of the few people that really liked the Steam Workshop. It was actually a selling point that convinced me to buy several games instead of pirate. I can't believe they just monetized community mods. I'm fucking done. Pirating every single player game from here on out.   Yeah, I tried restarting about 5 times to no avail. Can only seem to find non-Australian servers or play solo.   I think it's fine for balance reasons, but it just feels weird. More like the button is unresponsive rather than that it's too slow for balance purposes. I'd like to see them tweak animations and speed to make it fill a bit more natural.   I had no problem playing the game yesterday, but now when I press the matchmaking button it just does nothing.  I can't use the server browser either because there does not seem to be any servers under 100 ping (I live in remote Australia). The matchmaking games I found yesterday all had under 100 ping though.   I'm sure Tripwire appreciate any feedback, even if it something they ultimately decide will stay regardless of opinions.  I'd rather let people voice their opinions here freely then let you decide what does and doesn't qualify as a viable complaint/reddit thread.   For example, someone causes me to suffer an injury and a costly hospital bill. I take out money of a large interest account, and sue the party. It takes years to get that money back. I win the case and get the lump sum to cover my medical bill. Do I also get the interest I could have earned had the money remained in my account for a longer period?  What about lost opportunities (like using that money to buy a cheap house)?   Step 1: Create Reddit Account  Step 2: Comment anywhere on Reddit and casually mention that you're a young girl  Step 3: Free dick picks      Right, but a business that offers a better service would take their clients, so I'm not sure if this is a valid reason.   You might want to downsize condoms    I mean, everything I saw was a lie? So this whole story was fake?   You were watching a movie bro.   He definitely had a heart condition. It was weaker for sure, he masks it with a heart recording. I don't know what this guy is talking about.   I've never seen Star Wars (sue me), but is that accuracy consistently bad, or just in this one scene?   Isn't it like effectively covered up the crimes of others? For what benefit? Just admit it and condemn it.   Except they are designed to prevent people from getting into a prison. There are all sorts of security systems   Maybe he's secretly a wizard which is how he accomplishes his occasional feats and survives so much physical punishment, but he hides it because bounty hunters are after him.  Or maybe an alien failing to fit in with humans.  Maybe... Not.   Probably because OP didn't ask why it is the way it is.         But why not just use historical data to determine better wait times? For example, if after 12pm, on average, each patient is waiting for 20 minutes, then book the first patient after 12pm twenty minutes later than usual to 'fix' the accrued wait differences due to the compounded late patients.  It seems like all the data to cut down wait times should be available.   Edit: so HARD for them to estimate wait times   There just seem to be a lot of them.   "Haha nerd, I emotionally crippled you in school and now I'm financially hurting you in adult hood"   Funny, most of the bullies from my high school are moderate successes. A lot of the bullied kids are unemployed or working shitty jobs.  I'd be interested to see if the notion of bullies becoming gas pumpers is actually true, or of it's something people just say to make themselves feel better   It was a homeless man's gibberish.   No, that's the number one theory   I read it's been heard all over the world. How do they know it is one whale and not just a rare species?   Try 52hz whale   Round 1) TV Show Cory  Round 2) Videogame Cory   He probably didn't know who he was at all and misheard his name when people off camera tried to tell him who it was.      But they do, it just takes 14 hours.   So the answer is: yes. You would just have to keep your head submerged for a very long time.   While other people's answers are more on point, in general, it's just as easy to pirate anything. The vast majority of videogames have the same low quality piracy checks.   I think he already covered that in his post...   but no way to verify if it is due to the Final Solution.     You ignore the scenario where the creator gets nothing (usually if they work for a large company).   If it's a film based camera (not digital) and someone takes a photo with it, wouldn't you be the owner of the physical film? What if the camera was stolen to take the picture? You own the film that the image is printed on, but the shooter owns the rights to the image?  What if they take a photo with my camera (digital) and I refuse to give it to them to get 'their' property off it? Can I delete the photo if they have no copies?  What if I let them use my camera, they take an awesome picture and show it to them (still on the camera) to a third party who wants to purchase it for $200. Can I delete the picture before they copy it to a PC in this instance? Or would I owe $200?   Half-Life 3   Maybe he quit. No one wants to watch children play a videogame forever.   I think we're moved away from models that would lead to a collapse. Interesting thought nonetheless.    They die from forgetting too many dank memes and losing the will to live.   Is he wearing his pants up to his belly button in that pic, or am I imagining things?   Oh man, he sounded so excited.   I made [this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/whowouldwin/comments/1tsmsv/sherlock_holmes_gregory_house_and_adrian_monk/) a bit over a year ago. I've decided to redo it, but with some changes, as there were some flaws with it last time.  The contestants this time will be:   * **Ambrose Monk** replacing Adrian Monk. He is to Adrian what Mycroft is to Sherlock. However, after working closely with a psychologist, he has beaten most of his major issues and is able to compete on Jeopardy with minimal hassle.  * **Gregory House**, however he is fully motivated to win at all costs.  * **Sherlock Holmes** - specifically, the Sherlock from the BBC adaption, enabling him to level the playing field by not being at a 100 year disadvantage. * **Batman** - Generic Batman * **Adam West Batman** - From the 60s live action Batman. * **Shawn Spencer** from the television show Psych.  What order does each contestant come in in the following rounds:  Round 1: Ambrose vs House vs Holmes  Round 2: Batman vs Adam West Batman vs Shawn  Round 3: The winner from each round faces off  Bonus Round: The audience votes for a their favourite contestant. Who most likely wins the audience over with their overall performance, personality and banter with Trebek.  There is no cheating (no, Batman doesn't get the answers beforehand with prep time). It's a legit contest and assume everyone is motivated to win. Because reasons.         From wiki:  The value of Finnegans Wake as a work of literature has been a point of contention since the time of its appearance, in serial form, in literary reviews of the 1920s. Initial response, to both its serialised and final published forms, was almost universally negative. Even close friends and family were disapproving of Joyce's seemingly impenetrable text, with Joyce's brother Stanislaus "rebuk[ing] him for writing an incomprehensible night-book",[198] and former friend Oliver Gogarty believing the book to be a joke   I tend to pirate most games. Occasionally I will go on to buy the actual game if it's really good. This is something I've noticed while doing this. Anyone know why?   I don't recall one apartment that wasn't littered with cardboard boxes. If they existed, they were in the minority. Were people just constantly moving houses?      No ratings system to help filter quality stages from the rest, no search by author so talented stage creators can easily share there work. There aren't even shareable codes for stages. I was really looking forward to this feature since I've seen some great custom stages online, but it's not possible to share them without manually adding the author to my friends list. Anyone else disappointed in this regard?      I drink low fat because my girlfriend is a diet and exercise freak and I just assumed it's better. However, one day I just realised I don't have many fats in my diet at all. Should I start buying my own milk?   It's modern day Mike Tyson in a boxing match against the following opponents  1) A real life opponent  2) Real life, currently active boxers.  3) Fictional opponents only            The bomb is a special bomb that can only be disarmed with doubles. The 4chan user has no doubles currently on him so he has to get doubles of his own. He uses a nearby laptop to attempt to get the doubles. The laptop comes pre-equipped with 4chan's homepage already loaded and several hundred Christian Bale pictures.  His board of choice, but he must balance the odds of a slow board not being anywhere near doubles (and considering post restrictions) vs the difficulty of timing dubs on a fast board.  Can he do it in time?   text.         Comment text.            I'm applying for some part time work and stumbled upon a few jobs by this title. Hours look really good to suit Uni, but I'm not entirely sure what it actually involves. Some of the position descriptions include activities such as:   All aspects of merchandising for leading magazines publishers   Ensuring products receive the maximum benefit of promotional activity with effective product placement and visual displays using provided point of sale   Maintaining authorised planogram compliance and stock replenishment   Reporting on competitor activity  Does it involve sales of some sort? Because I'd be terrible at that. Is it just stocking shelves in Supermarkets? Any insight here?   I've always known it as a class in Final Fantasy, but it's also the title given to one of the characters in Game of Thrones. Where did the term originate from?   This might belong on Out of the Loop, because I just plain and simply don't know much about this shit. Also I understand that the goals of the people... attacking videogames (???) are not necessarily consistent.  But as a general rule of thumb, what are the main changes they want to see in the videogaming world? Like, if we all 'surrendered' and they typed up a list of demands to be immediately actioned, what would that list include?      Is there a directory or database of doctors that I have to register through? How do THEY check that I'm licenced? Or is it as simple as applying to a hospital, getting some friends to act as references and getting a job like any other?   Text here.   Cosmic turtle is canon?   From this page:  http://www.sony.net/SonyInfo/IR/financial/ar/Archive.html[1]  "Sony no longer produces an annual report."  Do they have any reporting requirements enforced by law? Can a public company just withhold it's information like that? What if shareholders want audited financial statements?         Instead of always trying to steal one why doesn't he just buy one and learn the secret forumula?

Rules: If he throws up, he loses. If he fails to consume one slice in a 3 minute period, he loses.   The Chosen Undead (Dark Souls), Bearer of the Curse (Dark Souls 2), The Hunter (Bloordborne) and the playable character from Demon's Souls enter a round robin tournament. Who wins?  You may build these characters anyway, with any weapons, based on the following restrictions:  Round 1) Starting classes only.  Round 2) Level 60 (distribute how you wish)  Round 3) All skills at their hard caps  Who is the ultimate winner?   I know it's probably too early, but I'm willing to accept speculation. Basically, I'm hoping to buy one in November as a Christmas present for my brother. However, as I live outside of the US, I will pretty much need to buy it ASAP in order for it to get here in time.  So: thoughts on it's viability as a controller in each genre? I'm most dubious about FPS games. Seems like it would be great for third person games.  What about stuff like Civ V? Would it actually be comfortable for extended periods?  RTS/MOBA are the only genre I'd immediately rule out having not used one.   Stemming from this discussion [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/startrek/comments/30t18v/why_enterprise_is_getting_another_look_and_why/)  It seems a lot of people did not appreciate how much Voyager jumped the shark and filled the Universe with too much overpowered technology that would limit any Trek's set post-Voyager.  The show is also often cited as being one of the low points in the franchise.  So what if it was officially de-canonised and a new Trek took it's place taking place after Deep Space 9? Would you be interested in seeing this happen?      I don't know why this sub requires it to be mandatory I supply text here since my thread does not need more than the title in the first place, so here is some text - and now I have to wait 10 minutes to make my post again because of this pointless rule.               Tried in home streaming and the lag was awful. Would upgrading my router (it's an entirely wireless connection, btw) be the best way to resolve this? What are other major factors that would affect in home streaming?      I'm wondering if I should commit to just fully upgrading my Kirkhammer, or should I hold onto some resources for later weapons? I'm trying to go for a simple Vit/Strength build for my first playthrough (with a little stamina thrown in).   I've tried both servers and the ping is pretty bad. Have any Australian players found a solution? Is there any possibility of getting SEA servers at some point in the near future?  From what I've played, this game looks pretty enjoyable, but the ping is a huge turn off.      Referring to the US.  It's illegal to hire a prostitute for sex, however it IS legal to hire an actor to have sex with someone else for the production of pornography.  So could four people (we'll say M1, M2, W1 and W2) get around prostitution laws by paying eachother off to make porn?  For example, M1 can't hire W1 as a prostitute. However, he could agree to hire W2 to have sex with M2 and request they film it (and upload the video to the Internet to fully ensure it's purpose as porn, even if it's to a deliberately small and unadvertised website) and in return M2 pays W1 to do the same for M1. M1 and M2 work for free.  Technically it'd just be porn, but the effect is just basic prostitution (providing you're willing to let the video go on the net).  Could you take it a step further and have 'brothels' that match participants for them, acting as an Agent on their behalf, and even include a service to blue the faces? If that's too much hassle, just use really, really low quality film and remove the sound?  To summarise: people basically just hire prostitutes for eachother and call it porn.   Daily? Weekly? Monthly? I guess it would vary pretty wildly, so I'll ask the question for two broad categories and accept generalised answers:  A) Famous porn stars. One's many people would know B) The 'average' porn star  Is it common for people to just do it once or twice and never again? Do most pornstars do it as their primary job or 'on the side' for some extra dosh?      And does he do anything else other than stand there? Sounds like an amazing job.   New to the game, my weapons are starting to feel really outdated and I'm not getting any good mod drops.  I've got blueprints for a Grakata and Heat Sword just sitting there ready to go, all but for 2 neurodes and a neural sensor. Where can I get these items ASAP? I've done the first two missions on Jupiter (first + Io) and found none as well as no neurode drops on Earth.  Why can't I seem to find any? They just drop from enemies right?         Three handicapped, but otherwise perfectly identical Batman's all face up against one another. Each has a unique handicap that will inhibit them in the fight. You may choose any Batman from any continuity or just answer for Batman in general since it's a larger generalisable answer between Batmen anyway.  Each Batman has a handicap: one Batman is missing a single arm (at the shoulder), another is missing a single leg (at the hip) and the third is missing both eyes, but has all limbs intact.  No gadgets that can overcome their handicaps can be used (robot limbs,  sonar replacing his eyes, etc).  **RULES**  -ALL ROUNDS ARE ROUND ROBIN STYLE TOURNAMENTS (three 1v1's as opposed to a single 1v1v1).  -NO PREP TIME IN ANY ROUND. They're thrown right in only finding out who their foe is at the last second.  -No leaving the warehouse  **Round 1:** Hand to hand combat with NO GADGETS. Takes place in an empty warehouse.  **Round 2:** Basic gadgets are allowed. The standard arsenal of Batman minus access to vehicles (so no remote controlling the Batmobile in to run the other Batman over). Takes place in standard warehouse.  **Round 3:** A large warehouse filled with crates, shipping containers and rafters. Completely dark, no lighting, emphasizing Stealth. Each Batman may use gadgets batarangs, grappling hooks and smoke pallets.  **Key**  Just to prevent confusion...  One legged Batman will be referred to as 1L.  One armed = 1A  No eyes = NE      It seems after Chappie opinions regarding the Blomdog have shifted a little around here. Are you still excited for Blommer's Alien movie? Do you think he has was it takes to pull it off, so to speak?   Their only option is to shoot one or the other with a potentially lethal shot (no time to close in as they are about to stab eachother in the heart).   Let's say Bill Clinton goes to stay at Obama's place to play videogames and have pizza all night. Each President is assigned mandatory security, so what happens in this scenario? Does Obama's guard just look after Clinton for the night, or does Clinton's security tag along?   I'm just going to rattle off some questions here that I'm curious about concerning the President's occupation of the White House...  1) When the President moves out, can he take any furniture with him? Does the new President inherit the furniture? What about stuff like mattresses and linen?  2) How much of the White House is the President's personal living space? I mean, does he have a garage he can go mess around in that no one else can enter? A loungeroom? Or is it like living with a ton of roommates all day?  3) Does the President get private Internet access? Can he watch porn with no one knowing?  4) What about buying personal things he might not want others to see? How does the First Lady buy lingerie? Sex toys? Etc?  5) Can the President choose to redecorate at will? What if he buys a new couch with his own money for the White House loungeroom? Does he get to take it with him when he leaves? What happens to the old one in the mean time?  6) Is there a White House landlord? Can the Pres make renovations as he wants? Or put in a new hook to hang a picture? Is he personally liable if he breaks something?   Also how likely would some sort of aircraft be at sneaking a nuke into the opposing country and dropping it manually?  Just how good are their anti-nuke defenses?   Alien can be any character from any franchise not born on Earth or part of the human species (so Thor would count, as he was not born on Earth). It also counts interdimensional beings and Gods, etc.  Round 1) It's a 'fist fight' on a football field. Contestants are not allowed their weapons (unless it's part of them).  Round 2) The alien is hunting Duke on the Nostromo. The strongest alien contender in this round can be no bigger than three times a the Xenomorph from the first Alien movie in order for it to move about the ship. Duke gets any and all weapons - but will risk structural damage by using them, as well as use of any of the equipment aboard the Nostromo.  Round 3) On an open field like round 1, but both sides get their equipment (whatever gear is typical of the alien and any weapon Duke has used).      http://www.dotabuff.com/heroes/played  46.66% at the moment.   For further clarification: if we measured some quantum interaction and rewound time to observe the interaction again, would it play out the exact same? Or, because it's truly random, could something completely different happen?   I'm just wondering what Steam Link actually does and what kind of equipment I need to minimise lag. I don't really have much of a home network beyond a cheap router and a PC. What exactly are the requirements for a good Steam Link connection? It performance dependent on my router?  Also I'm assuming the Steam Controller will use bluetooth? The only thing I have tried in this regards with my PC is a DS4 control, which had huge input lag. What is most likely to cause this issue (so I can get whatever gear is needed for Steam Link's release)? The DS4 or my Bluetooth dongle?      Batman's Bane, with this suit: http://i.imgur.com/1AWryyp.jpg  Round 1) Can Batman beat him without hurting a baby?  Round 2) Who is the weakest superhero that can beat him without hurting a baby?      Everytime I launch the game I have to re-download them. Anyone know what's up?                        The battle format will be a round robin style tournament, with one point awarded for a win and 0.5 points awarded to each contestant for a tie. The contestants are:  **Runescape Guy**  * Max level in all stats * All quests complete (use as a feat marker) * Any equipment may be used * Potions may be used to buff your character pre battle  * No healing consumables may be used post battle * Unlimited runes * May change gear mid battle (IIRC, this is true for the game. Otherwise ignore this point)  **Dragonborn (Skyrim)**  * Max level. Skill distribution as you see fit * Access to any gear, max refinement * Same as Runescape guy in regards to consumables: may buff before battle, but cannot use healing items, etc * Access to all spells * Access to all shouts * No companion (but can summon units) * Only feats that occur in game (eg. it's said the Dragonborn can destroy mountains with shouts, but nothing approaching that strength is actually performed in game. It's hearsay) * Can change skill distribution between battles to best match the opponent * Can change gear mid fight * Any race, gender, starting class you want  * Can change between rounds  **Bearer of the Curse (Dark Souls II)**  * Access to any gear (max upgrade) * Can change gear mid fight * May buff weapons and self before the fight * Skill distribution as you see fit * Access to all spells * Can change skill distribution between battles * Can use a fully upgraded Estus Flask, but no other consumables  **Geralt of Rivia (The Witcher)**  * Max level. Skill distribution as you see fit, can change between battles * Access to all gear * CANNOT change gear mid fight * May meditate and use potions before the battle * Geralt as at Witcher 2.  * This means you can use the first game and all the books as reference for his feats * Access to ONE of each bomb and trap type  --------------------------------------------  *Round 1* Geralt vs Runescape Guy  *Round 2* Geralt vs Dragonborn  *Round 3* Geralt vs The Chosen Undead  *Round 4* Runescape Guy vs Dragonborn  *Round 5* Runescape Guy vs The Chosen Undead  *Round 6* Dragonborn vs The Chosen Undead  -------------------------------------  *Scoreboard*  Use the following format for a quick summary at the end of your post if you would like.

If used on allies, a stat bonus is applied to all of the targets stats after the shuffle is complete.   **DURATION:** 8  **STAT BONUS:** 2/4/6/8  [](#mana) **MANA COST**: 95 / 105 / 115 / 125   [](#cd) **COOL DOWN**: 5 / 4 / 3 / 2   * For example, an enemy with 20s, 18a and 15i may wind up with 18s, 15a and 20i. However, an ally with those same stats will wind up with (assuming the skill is level 4) 26s, 23a and 28i. Depending on the difference between stats and the skills level, it could have a net positive affect on each stat if used on an ally. Low cooldown allows you to wreak havoc in a fight, although has short cast range.   -----------   **W - Break**   | | | |-|-| | Ability | Target Unit | | Affects | Enemy hero |    Breaks the fundamental connection between an enemies item and The Source, causing it to malfunction. Item is selected at random.  **DURATION:** 5/6/7/8   [](#mana) **MANA COST**: 120   [](#cd) **COOL DOWN**: 60 / 50 / 40 / 30   * An enemies malfunctioning item will be marked in his inventory. A malfunctioning item will continue to provide stat bonuses, but will not offer any other passive effects. Attempting to use the malfunctioning items active ability will result in a 50% chance of the active malfunctioning (doing nothing and going on cooldown), a 40% chance of it backfiring (varies from item to item. Abyssal Blade will cast on yourself, whereas BoTs will simply deal damage to you) and a 10% chance of functioning normally.    -----------   **E - Block**   | | | |-|-| | Ability | Passive | | Affects | N/A |    Blocks random amounts of damage from each source of damage applied to Gabe.    **BLOCK MIN:** 5% / 10% / 15% / 20% **BLOCK MAX:** 10% / 20% / 30% / 50%   * It is NOT evasion, so it cannot bypassed with True Strike. Works pretty simply. After the final amount of damage is determined (after magic resistance, armour, other blocks, etc) the damage is reduced further by a random amount. For example, if Lina's ultimate would strike for 500 damage with this ability ignored, once the ability is taken into account (say, a level 3 Block) a random amount between 15% and 30% is blocked. In this case, say 20%. Only 400 damage will be dealt.   -----------   **R - Rewind**   | | | |-|-| | Ability | Active | | Affects | Everyone and everything | | Radius | Global |    Turns back the course of events in the universe, returning everything to its original position several seconds earlier.   **TIME REWOUND:** 4 seconds  [](#mana) **MANA COST**: 100   [](#cd) **COOL DOWN**: 360 / 320 / 280   * This works as if rewinding the game in a replay. EVERYTHING goes back. If you used a BKB two seconds ago, and Gabe uses this ability, your BKB is back off cooldown, its time restored. All spells go back to whatever their cooldown was a few seconds ago. Etc. It's just like restoring a save state. It's a 'free undo' of a bad teamfight or an ally getting ganked. Nothing can prevent it or block it.   By that I mean, I don't need to do a bunch of missions introducing units and mechanics one at a time. And the missions involve traditional RTS objectives and style of play instead of escorting main characters through a level?  I'm specifically looking to play a single player campaign. I enjoy AoE, SC (original and II) and Sins of a Solar Empire. I've never played much Warcraft, but from what I could see it focused quite heavily on hero units, which I'm not that into.   Thanks.         And assuming they saved the two US citizens, would they face consequences for saving them over the POTUS?  Would the answer change if the two citizens were children?  The scenario isn't important, but imagine an ultimatum type scenario. A decision must be made - and quickly (maybe a hostage situation with only enough time to save one, or they're drowning, idk). Saving one group will lead to the death of the other group, doing nothing leads to everyone dying. For whatever reason they have to work as a group, so they can't split up an attempt to help both. Also, all this information is known to everyone involved. It's one or the other.            I don't mind ordering from overseas. Looks like Ozgameshop ($74) is the cheapest I can find.      Frieza was considered to be the most powerful being of his time, and was for quite some time. Then all of a sudden, in the course of a few years, we go from Frieza to God level enemies.  How can there be so many levels of Super Saiyan above basic Super Saiyan without them ever being achieved in history before?  It's like if after years of 100m runners shaving milliseconds of someone's records, all of a sudden someone comes along and sets a record at 5 seconds. Then some other guy comes along and does it in 4, then a third guy in three all over the course of a few weeks.  If Super Saiyan is so rare, why are so many cropping up in the decade (or whatever) that DBZ takes place?  Why is everyone suddenly so powerful? Where were these bad guys a few decades before Goku?  **TL;DR: Why is this point in history seeing a sudden power spike?**   Scenario 1: Bruce Wayne is adopted by the [Nolastname's](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Characters_of_Malcolm_in_the_Middle#Main_characters) after his parents deaths.  He is a genetically gifted child with the ability to excel in anything he does, but has a very different temperament to Malcolm and the boys. Does he excel in this environment or wind up like Frances?  Scenario 2: He is the birth child of Lois and Hal, replacing Malcolm. Genetically the same as he was before, except now his parents never died. How does this impact his development? Remember the negative impact his older brothers will have on his behaviour.  But this is who would win!  "You will never come up against a greater adversary than your own potential" -Dr. Stubbs, Star Trek: The Next Generation.      For more info: it's a 27 inch monitor, and a smaller (21 inch?) monitor, around a 600 PSU in my PC and a 40W/240V desktop light and a 6 speaker set up. Currently I just have the larger monitor, PC and speakers plugged in. It comes from an extension cord that runs to a powerboard accross the room. Would the rest be too much?  I'm in Australia btw.         Skyrim is the obvious standout. What other games have made great use of the Steam workshop?               I'm sure we're all aware of the classics by now: Pixelvision, Metro, Air, etc  But what are some nice, lesser known skins or newer skins that have impressed you? I feel like it's time for a change.  	163

 [To this song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQYQTFudrqc)   So much for civil discourse.    They could implement dogs on to those farms. Such as the [Anatolian shepherd](http://www.dogwork.com/anatolian-shepherd-cheetah) that has been used in Botswana and South Africa to protect cattle and sheep from cheetahs. These are centuries old techniques that absolutely work.  Wolves were here first. We have to manage our resources responsively. That includes hunting, preservation, reintroduction, and capital gain from our biodiversity and ecosystems.   As a hunter, think about it. Big game parks, all over the great plains. Coinciding with ranches, state, and national parks. Hunters benefit. Local economies benefit. Tourism benefits. It's a win win for everyone, when done correctly.   Can you cite a source? I've just never heard of humans successfully replacing natural predators, I could be wrong though.  Edit: And the reason to return these megafauna is to return (for example) the great plains to their natural state. Large animals eat large amounts of plants, which are hunted by large predators, which die off to feed large scavengers. All of which returns nutrients to the soil. VERY, VERY simplified.   We also have fossil evidence to date a lot of those animals back as well. Pre-humans. As in 13,000 years ago. Not very long at all.   I'll bite. Care to elaborate?      If you're interested, [Dr. Martin](http://www.amazon.com/Twilight-Mammoths-Extinctions-Rewilding-Environments/dp/0520252438) did a lot of research in that exact field.

Christopher Moore is someone you stop all books to read for, finish the book in two days, and realize you quote him more often than you'd like. *cough cough* Such as.  "I like my men like I like my tea. Green and weak."    First off, yes, I'm getting him a 'omg, we're back together' gift. weird. But let's move on. And bare with me, book suggestions are needed.  A)  1: He's a fan of The Jungle Book movie, which is a pretty sweet animation. I just thought it'd be cute to go a step further and get him a first edition of the original, or a later edition with some age to it that he'd like. Maybe I'm thinking in the wrong direction. Any who, where a bouts could I find such a book for a good deal? In that same arena...  2: Disco Bloodbath by James St. James. Made impossible to find by Party Monster. We are a gay couple, and he's seen the movie and all it's horrific glory, and thought it'd be a sick find. I don't even know where I'd begin to find such a thing, and how much it's selling for. Is it too risky? Is the Jungle Book idea better? You tell me...  B) Scrap both of those ideas. Something philosophical? He was a philosophy major for awhile, and enjoys reading on the subject quite a bit. Very spiritual. Almost nihilistic. But I know for a fact he doesn't like pompous, or over the top eccentric language. Down to earth. Readable. Hopefully positive. I'm more of a 'tangible sciences' type of guy, so I really have no idea on what would be good. Help?  Overall, which idea do you like best, which is doable, and maybe what suggestions you might have.  Oh yea all online!   Thanks r/booksuggestions!

I believe the dog was a poodle, basically I knew the dog needed to come in. Called the woman. Told her how long it had been since the dog's last haircut. Told her we'd love to see Sir Barks-A-Lot back in the salon. She proceeded to call me a liar, that the dog had been in recently, and it hadn't been 10 weeks. This went on for about a minute, before i just told her, in my nicest most sincere voice, to have a wonderful day and hope to see you soon.   I'm a dog groomer, and sort of late to this one.  I've been grooming for around 2 years now, but when i started as an apprentice, my instructor wanted me to shave the hair out of a bulldog's pads (they have short hair, so this doesn't make sense, though i believe the dog stepped in something that gunked the hair together that the bath couldn't get out, I digress.)   Well, I was doing my job, and as bulldogs normally do, he donkey kicked me. Except I had clippers in my hand. Well the clippers went flying. I fumbled them in the air for a few seconds while they were still running, and the clippers, just for a millisecond of a second, landed on the dog. They made a three inch line of no hair, on a dog that never needed to see clippers for a groom in its entire life (maybe a #50 or #60 blade for surgery prep, again, digressing.) Fortunately my instructor was cool about it, and explained it all to the owners, and took the blame herself. Could of been like a million times worse. But then again, I'm not sure the hair will grow back normally. Bulldogs are weird.

My boyfriend and I have been talking about jealousy a lot lately.  We broke up a few months ago, and got back together. My jealousy had a lot to do with it. I get pretty mad when he hangs out with his other gay friends. Especially older ones that are in open relationships. I've curbed it to some extent, because I know he loves me. I want him to have friends, and wants the same to me. I just can't help but say stupid shit and act like an envious, psychotic douchenozzle. Bleh. I'm *trying* to work on it.   Roger the Alien.

I'm not sure if this is a stereotype, but your gay friend growing up? He probably had a huge crush on you.  I'm gay and crushed on my best friends. I must have heard the same thing from most dudes I've dated.   Get a sulcatta tortoise! They basically eat the same stuff as rabbits. They poop once or twice a day. They need a bath once a week. And if you put them on your (untreated) lawn, they basically mow it/fertilize it. Here's my [baby](http://imgur.com/a/ZDS69#SBQumVB)   This made me sad to think about. Well... I got STD tested before I dated my first boyfriend at a christian testing center. We started dating, and then the results came back. It said I was HIV-1 positive. While I freaked out and got tested over and over again (even the state health department got involved), my boyfriend stayed by my side, well aware he might test positive as well. Every test came back negative, and I, understandably, lost my shit over the next 6 weeks. Finally, they were able to tell me I was negative. The whole thing of me losing my shit mentally, and this whole 'we both have HIV' thing threw a wrench in our relationship, so he broke up with me. Which I get. Completely. It was both of our first relationship and it was just totally fucked up by me. We've both moved on and done better and bigger things.   Oh my god that's so goddamn good.   This. This is what I was going to say. But we're gay, so it's different. (Or maybe we aren't different after all)   Mexican red rice.

The little koala    Our story begins deep within a forest that was big, tall, and smelled clean all the time. The sky was always blue and the sun was so hot you could cook an egg on a rock. The leaves were crunchy, and the birds were real loud. They sounded just like in the movies. What does this sound like to you?   On one of these big, clean smelling trees, slept a little koala. She was small and grey. Her eyes closed shut and she snored, sometimes itching her little back with her big koala claws. A parrot looking bird called a cockatoo landed right next to her and woke her up with the birds loud squawk.   When the little koala awoke, she wasnt happy. She was grumpy from her nap. She likes to sleep all the time. The little koala was now hungry and grumpy, and wanted to drink some milk from her mother, so she called out to her mother. It sounded like coo-coo.   She looked to the left. She then looked to the right. Her mother was no where to be seen. All she could see was that loud cockatoo that woke her up. She began to cry, because now she was grumpy, hungry, and sad. Where did her mother go? Didnt she know it was time for the little koala to eat?   The cockatoo looked at the little koala with curiosity. This made the little koala even more grumpy. The cockatoo came closer, and closer, and closer. The little koala swatted the bird with her big claws, but the bird wouldnt go away. Off in the distance, a bunch of odd sounds finally scared the bird away. They were coming closer!   Bark, bark, bark, bark, the little koala had never heard the sounds before. They were new sounds, and they were scary sounds. They were getting louder, too! The little koala started climbing up her tree, as far up as she could climb with her little koala claws. The animals that made the 'bark bark bark sound were close.   She was so scared! She closed her eyes real tight, and imagined her mother was holding her close. Nothing could get her if her mother was there. Just like that, the barking stopped, and the scary animals ran away. She was still scared, but glad they were gone. She started climbing back down the tree, when all of the sudden she was stuck in a net!   The little koala fell from the tree inside this net, and she scratched and scratched so she could get free. She used all the strength she had in her little koala claws, but nothing worked. She soon gently fell to the ground, and was surrounded by a tall blonde woman that smelled like flowers. The little koala began to cry.   The woman quickly wrapped the little koala in a blanket and held her close. The little koala was less scared. Im sorry, little koala. You must be so scared. Lets get you some food and a nice place to sleep, away from those dogs. Everything is going to be alright. The little koala felt a little better from the sweet sound of her voice.   Just like the woman had said, the little koala was safe with her. She was no longer grumpy, and she was no longer hungry. The little koala wasnt mad, and she was no longer scared. She had a new home, with lots of other little koala friends, and she could still climb the clean smelling trees and sleep, just like where our story began.    Hi, I'm the CEO of Seaworld Entertainment, and I'm sure most of you hate me! (Nicely) AMA!   Understatement of the year.   It gets better once you don't test positive for THC, which could be a few weeks, or for me, a few months (I'm not fat, I'm big boned.... lol I'm not fat).   Your symptoms of withdrawal will take about that amount of time. [Marijuana Anonymous' website](https://www.marijuana-anonymous.org) has a great section on what to expect with withdrawal. Some things i experienced? Mood swings, outburst, being thirsty, decreased then later increased appetite and weight gain, insomnia, paranoia, lethargy, believe it or not, these are normal. Your body is getting rid of THC, you will be weird. It looks like bipolar, schizophrenia, clinical insomnia, which you may or may not have, but you need to properly detox before getting the best diagnosis. Thank god I waited, cause I'm (mostly) good now and don't need medication for much of anything.   That's good man! I might even go a step farther though... It sounds cold as fuck, but friends that still smoke? I might just hangout with them less. Or if they do, let them know it can't be around you. For any reason. I mean I still have friends that smoke, just only a very select few. And they don't smoke around me. My boyfriend smokes as well. And I NEVER let him do it around me, he even keeps all his gear in a cabinet I don't go in to normally. What has happened, is that the people that smoke bud moved on. They didn't have a codependent in me, so they just found other people to blaze with. I'm better for it, they weren't real homies. Day.... 323 or something? I should probably know that.

I think people could guess that one.      Nanananananananananana... BAT DOG.         I feel real things. Motivation.... i'd say is pretty medium to low. Though that's my personality. I pray for my drive, and soak in social interaction. When it comes to work though, taking pride in doing a good job gets me through the day. I don't experience abnormal mood swings. I get startled, upset, mad, happy, excited, in very natural and steady ways. When I was detoxing I was a roller coaster. Interacting with me was like walking on egg shells. Today I'm mellow, and let things come at me as they are.    Drink tons of water. Herbal teas. Stay away from caffeine. Understand that symptoms of withdrawal are real, and will pass. They are mood swings, resembling bipolar and or depression disorder. Going on walks will become your best friend. Realize that you can only live day by day. Your goal is to not smoke JUST for today. You are not a fortune teller. You could pick up a joint tomorrow. But just for today, you won't. And that my dear friend, is amazing.  Guy, by the way. Cheers.      He wasn't much to look at,  The ragged, mange'd tiger.  Let's just say the years took a toll.   The cat had a strip of forest,  Grandfathered in, gifted, with  The occasional sika fawn, food.   Moving forward wasn't an issue,  And survival was second nature  When cornered with a hunter's gun.

I think I know one of the [fish](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarcastic_fringehead) that it was based off of.   Hey guys!  Well to start out, i first smoked pot when I was around 16, to get closer to friends I may or may not have had crushes on. Well music sort of replaced that, so I didn't smoke really until college, and I met more attractive people whom I wanted attention from!  Soon, it wasn't about friends, it was about feeding my monster (I'm the monster). Reisin tokes from pipes that weren't mine, stealing from friends, digging through my car carpet to look for little nugs, hitting up people to hook up with ONLY because I wanted to smoke (I think that counts as a form of prostitution?); I was a slob. I had this chick that worked at a clinic tell me I was on the lower end of the pot smoking pyramid. I agreed not knowing how right she actually was.  So I went to rehabs. 3. When I was 19 (outdoor wilderness... sweet), 21 (hospital?), and 22 (mostly heroin junkies there... fuck). Nothing worked. I seemed to get out, be sober for awhile, then just kind of meet up with certain people and it'd be back to square one. Well most recently, I was sober, working a great job, then just kind of got desperate. Met a stoner, moved across the country with him, and surprisingly (not surprisingly) my life turned to shit quickly. So I quit. I quit pot, quit him, moved back, and got my life back on track.  I've pissed off a lot of people in my life. I make amends when I can. I find prayer helps. Working. Being proud of my work. Dating has been considerably less stressful and oddly enough, people find me more attractive? Weird. It's also weird to look at that number. 320. A lot has happened in those days. First 2 months I was still basically a train wreck while I detoxed. I got over it with a good diet. But it just zoomed by. Life has gone by, with or without pot. Now I'm just aware of it. The haze has been lifted and I can exist within the days passing by.  So. Thanks for existing. Thanks for not smoking pot. And thanks for reading a little bit about myself that i don't normally get to share.   And yet people still wonder why dog groomers require rabies vaccinations for every single dog we work on.  "But California NEVER has rabies."  "IDC, don't wanna test that statistic with your dog."   I've never stared at a gif for so long.   Ok. Well believe it or not, your 'Shower Thought' has been answered before. The answer is no. Gay children aren't the product of gay parents. People are the product of people. Gay communities don't breed more gay babies.   7.162 Billion.   The episode with Brian and Stewie in the bank vault? 100%. I don't even think it has any cutaway gags.   I lost brain cells reading this.   I always thought sig figs were relevant only when you had other numbers you were dealing with. Just out of curiosity, why would it matter if I rounded that 2 up or not?   80085 doesn't look as cool on a computer screen...   Unless you get me something really cool.   I just bought my baby for $35 (I know, I know, Walmart sells it for $24.99, heard that from every girl in the salon), and I want to know how to best keep care of it, how long to charge it, how to get the battery to last longest, when to buy a new one; ANY tips you guys can dish. Thanks so much! :-*   Ok few things  1) I would always go the professional route, 10 lbs australian shepherd should only be about 50 bucks.  2) If I was absolutely strapped for cash (and wasn't a groomer), I wouldn't use clippers on the dog, especially a double coated dog like yours. The hair grows back badly, ruins the top coat. I would skim the butt area, where the most hair grows, with the clippers. I've used a 10, but you can make mistakes easily. If you don't want to make a mistake, use thinning sheers to make the butt area behind the back legs look uniformly rounded. Then, I would make the outline of the dog even (the back of the front legs, the chest, the undercarriage) with thinning sheers. It's a great, natural look. For the clippers, I would clean the anal area (one inch each side to make sure poop doesn't get stuck), the bottom of the paws (scooping out the hair gently), and that's about it. #10 blade, I use a #40 on the feet, don't do that. I would not shave this dog, and i would beg a client not to either. This is a brushing dog. Lots and lots of brushing. Make sure the dog is 100% dry before doing any of this, and clean 100%.  Edit: Tired of hand scissoring? Skim with a #10, just do it at your own risk. You may make holes.  Let me know if you have any other questions.      **SEA LION**   Its the only source that says that   Like that's the only evidence i found it's an april fool's joke   I know that's why i posted it, but I'm not sure it's an april fool's joke, or that in itself is the april fool's joke that you can do it yourself.   Newspaper correspondent Hou Mingming  Newspaper correspondent Chengjiang Feng / text  Newspaper reporters TaoYu its / photo  Spring, the Dongyang streets often inundated with strange taste. Dongyang people say that this is the boy egg taste, but also the taste of spring.  Do not want to surprise people familiar with the matter: the boy with the boy in urine is boiled eggs, eggs, eggs in the spring of stalls selling all over the lad Dongyang streets. A fifty-one lad expensive than ordinary eggs boiled eggs, can often sell out of stock.  Do not underestimate this one boy eggs, it was named Dongyang intangible cultural heritage.  Classroom door  The boys in front of a plastic barrel "hush hush"  Dongyang city in an elementary school, recess, a bunch of little boys crowded in the hallway outside the classroom noisy. Do not think that what they are playing new stuff, they are urinating.  In Dongyang, this old custom has been formed: the street vendors who sell eggs boy or boy eggs to cook their own people, will be carrying a plastic bucket to a school boy to collect the urine.  Students who long ago got used to this, one to three grade boys to urinate, he will align the plastic bucket outside the classroom. School teacher, also acquiesced in such behavior, they will always remind the kids not to pee in a plastic bucket during cold sick. The children came obedient.  Boiled eggs and cook boiled eggs almost boy  The most critical time heat  Oddly enough, although this season has filled the stalls sell eggs boy, but every family believes their own unique taste.  Li aunt runs a stall selling eggs boy. Her husband went to a nearby elementary school is responsible for daily pick boy urine. She is responsible for cooking and trafficking.  In front of her stall, a briquette stove is hard to give steel cookware is heated. Pot head "water" looks yellow, which also had a little foam afloat. Li aunt to wash eggs one by one into steel finishing Guo Lifang.  "After this road to boil, put all our eggs out, knock crack the shell, and put into cooking. Over time, then up and down to change the location of the eggs, add fresh boy urine. This repeated, with different fire , cook the whole day and night. "When it comes to the process of boiled eggs, and Li said the aunt, principle and almost cooked boiled eggs, and time to master the furnace is the most critical.  Some people say eating addiction "really sweet", some people feel that "stinks"  With urinary boiled eggs, what would taste?  Yesterday, 12:00 many people coming and going on the road, Dongyang urban revitalization, visit the lad egg eaters natural lot. "Good food, I eat 10 it one day." Liu Dongyang several years ago with her husband came to life, "had never eaten later after eating a hooked."  If one sentence Dongyang preference for boy eggs, friends, "surname eggs" on the microblogging put it very well - the lad egg taste is the taste of spring.  But not all people are good this one Dongyang. 30 years, a native of Lee boy did not eat eggs, "that I can not stand the taste, I thought of nausea, stinks."  Boy eggs fill it? TCM each saying: be careful to eat, no objection  Dongyang in many people's eyes, with a boy in urine cooked eggs, spring tonic of choice. Boy selling eggs will always tell you, boy eat eggs, spring would not be sleepy, summer does not heat stroke.  But to say this thing is going to fill a number, maybe the doctors would be more objective point.  "Boy has a long history of eggs in Dongyang, previously poor living conditions, to do farm work, to make himself something only the eggs, while urine sediment over time, will form crystals, which is equivalent to a crystalline called 'white people' of traditional Chinese medicine, can nourishing yin, bleeding governance silt. "Dongyang City Hospital medical director Wu Yunhua introduced this boy eggs. But she also stressed that not everyone is suitable for the boy to eat eggs, depending on the individual's constitution.  Jinhua Central Hospital Nephrology Master Ren Huangjian think, urine is the body's waste discharge, substantially free of substances beneficial to the human body. Therefore, he does not advocate everyone to eat the boy eggs.  TCM  Jinhua City Hospital director said that, in ancient times, the boys often used as medicine introduction of urine, but modern health perspective, children boiled eggs in urine is always less hygienic. "But boy eating eggs has become Dongyang local customs, I do not advocate nor oppose it."  Reporters also learned that the boy has been named Dongyang egg Intangible Cultural Heritage in 2008. In this regard, it is  Intangible Cultural Heritage Protection Center for  said that he collected information lad eggs and handed application. Finally, Dongyang folk art leadership team nine members unanimously adopted, after two weeks of publicity, Dongyang city government official under the document.

So cool. So I post it on r/gaming. My intention wasn't to argue with children.   By the way, I have countless dogs that come in to my salon EVERY SINGLE week. And they come in tails wagging, recognizing me and my coworkers.   You haven't brought any argument forward that it is animal abuse. These dogs do enjoy it, anecdotal evidence or not.

And if you are reposting something, just deleting it seems to make sense.   It was 5 days ago I posted it, and I wouldn't be surprised if someone posted it before or after that. OP is a douchenozzle.   I kind of have to agree, you sort of do suck though. Just delete it. Do it. Do it.

A cute guy's smile as I stare at his bulge. Yup.   Take a bowl, put in some flour. Put a one or two pinches of baking soda and salt, any spices you want like pepper or cumin, whatever. Mix it dry, then slowly add water. Slowly mixing it, until it is doughy, not running. You want to be able to knead it in your hands (having flour on your hands help not get them disgusting). Do it for like... 5-10 minutes? Then flatten it in to small patties. Put the patty away from the flame, but close enough that it gets cooked, and here's the kicker, right on the ashes. What?! But then I'm eating ash! No, you pat it away after the bread cooks, plus, a little ash never hurt anyone. It's awesome, amazing, and great to eat with beans, hummus, meat, whatever.   It's not confusion if they've come to terms with their identity. Heteronormative culture tells you because of your genitals at birth, you fit in this corner or that corner. That's what has people confused at a young age. Their brains tell them what society says is not true. That constant chastising of a person's personal gender identity, such as saying a woman is not a woman, because she happened to be born with a penis, is transphobia. With or without whatever genitals said person has, it's not your business, and it's not a determinate factor of that person's gender identity or sexuality.   Look up the game 'Mafia'. 'Candybar' is another really good game.  If you bring flour, some baking soda, some salt, you can make ash bread in the camp fire.  Cook food you like. Go shopping and freeze stuff if you must.

Yes, I get it, but that's a ball buster for me, LGBT people are my homies, and I don't stand for transphobia.   Ok, hold the fuck up, you can't speak for what goes on in other peoples' heads.

    Also the first time the word "vagina" was said on film.   I love KSC....live right up the road a bit, and I don't get out there enough.  I'm a space and science nerd, and I find plenty to keep me interested there. Totally worth admission.  Unfortunately, there are several paid add-ons at the park now. Didn't used to be that way, but new times, new money. The biggest is the new Up Close tour, which gets you in the VAB and STS mission control. I think it's around $25 more, per person. I haven't done it yet, but I have friends that say it's totally worth it.  Overall, even without the add-ons, especially if you haven't been there in quite a while, I say go.

Rip a page out of the girl's playbook and make a few pre-emptive comments to make sure she knows that she's hanging out in the friend zone.  But make sure that you're right about her being interested. This could possibly backfire in a big way.   I like boob-shaped boobs.   Dude here.   Um, no. A lot of jokes, and there's an understanding that all of us do it, but that's about it.  I guess the closest I ever came to really having a conversation about it with a guy friend is recommending a personal lubricant (Coconut oil!) but no frank discussions. (My wife and I do, though)   I think it's completely okay to tell someone that you think they are wrong. But as an atheist, and a realist, I know from experience that people with deep held beliefs, especially those of faith, are not familiar with the idea of being wrong.  Sexuality and xtian beliefs are very difficult to navigate, and after OP states his issue as "GF won't have sex because of her christian reasons", I have great concern about any conversation along the lines of "Let me tell you why I think you are wrong about the way you feel about sex." OP's gf is likely translate that as "Let me tell you why your religion is wrong" which is probably a relationship ender, if she has strong beliefs.  Repeating myself, but certainly OP and gf have to talk. The two of them are going to be doing a lot of that, they will have to if they want a non-believer/believer relationship to work, but don't try to talk your way into sex, that's coercion at best, and when you combine that with trying to change someone's faith, it becomes something terrible.  My opinion. Meh.   Absolutely. But to attack those beliefs in order to change them, no matter how strongly he feels that she might be wrong in those beliefs, is wrong.   First off, your link is broken, it goes to the search page. But I found what you are talking about.  1. Lust and Fornication are sins. You are shit outta luck here bud. If she believes, then she believes, and belief is going to tell her that what she wants is wrong, and is bad. That's a tough one to get over.  2. Virginity is a gift. Sure it is. And if you guys are in love, then give it to each other.   3. The risk of pregnancy. It is true that not having sex is a pretty sure fire way to not get pregnant. But my wife and I have had sex....oohh about 7 billion times and we have far less children than that.  4. Heartaches from dating. Sure, breaking up is terrible. But if you guys are sure that you're going to be married and like totally in love forever and ever, shouldn't be an issue then.  5. Virginity is cool. No, no it isn't. Neither is not being a virgin. It's just a state of being.  6. Sexual purity and God's plan. If she believes, then she believes. See point 1.  7. Fornication is not healthy. Well, unprotected sex might be risky, but the human body is built to do this sort of thing, so not so much.  Listen, if she has deep set xtian beliefs, you're going to have to respect that. You can't talk her out of thinking that her virginity is God's gift to her, for her to give to her husband, and only her husband, without attacking her religion at large. If you do that, then you don't respect her, and without respect you guys have no hope for that ever after bit that both of you are hoping for. (You can however, lead her to read, and maybe she'll begin to question her faith on her own, and then you can be there to help, but you can't push. Taking someone's faith just so you can take their virginity is a very special kind of rape.) Best of luck.

I never saw my mom or dad drink when growing up. I have had a beer with my pops in the past five years, but I don't think that he does much drinking.   I'm a more-or-less daiiy drinker.  I think my dad's dad, who died early, might have been an alcoholic. There wasn't much talk about it, but I get that feeling, you know.   I too am a FOH guy, though trained and most comfortable as BOH. I sort of fell into a job as a FOH guy, with food safety management responsibilities.  I like my job, it has its perks, but I'm working for less than I'm worth. Was hired on for less than I'm worth. Made that deal with the devil so my kids could go to a good school, and I live on the beach, and super close to work, so all good.  I hired on as the fourth manager. After the first one got fired since I was there (for theft and drugs) the boss decided to not replace. After the second one got fired (also theft and drugs) it was just the GM and I.   During the next four years, we have had manager after manager brought in and fail.   There was the KM that was transferred over from another unit to avoid sexual harassment charges. He was fired after a threat of another sexual harassment charge.  There was a FOH manager that was brought in that couldn't count. Couldn't keep his hands off of the girls. Made threats instead of plans. All around douche. He was fired, basically for being a douche.  There was the combo manager, FOH/BOH, that acted like it was his first time in the kitchen, had no idea how to talk to either customers or employees, and spent most of his time on the phone threatening his ex-girlfriend. (His wife had died under somewhat suspicious circumstances, as well). He was fired for being ineffective, and went over to his ex-girlfriends house and shot himself.  I put up with all of this and more. Got a couple of raises, basically each time someone got shitcanned, but not enough, but I appreciated the gesture. During this time, sales were down terribly, we work in a tourist town, and the recession fucked us, so I didn't make waves.  Last month, we brought in a KM to train for another restaurant, and a FOH guy for ours. (Side note, to explain how batshit insane the boss man is sometimes, our KM approached our boss interested in moving from hourly at our restaurant, to salary at the other unit. He was turned down, and then asked to train the KM that was going to take the job that he applied for. It was super effective.)   While doing some EOM paperwork, I noticed an email that talked about how we were going to distribute the labor burden for the KM trainee, and I saw that he made 2k less a year than I did. Pissed. Did some digging and found out that the new FOH guy was hired on at 2k plus what I was currently making. More pissed.  Wouldn't have been that big of a deal, but this FOH guy doesn't do anything. Like all day, nothing. Walks around, talks on the phone, and does a hundred little things that work against the restaurant, not for it.  I approached my boss, and explained that this was unacceptable, and that if she was interested in keeping me (we get along famously and are a good team) that this needed to be addressed.  She approached the boss man, and the response that she got was "I didn't think that he (me) liked his job anyway..."  I started looking for new work the next day. Still there, but not for too much longer, and I won't be going out of my way to give notice or help train a replacement.   Yeah, sandwich stuff. All those ingredients going into the po-boys will have to have been prepared ahead of time.  Proteins: Peeling, cooking, cooling shrimp, slicing meats, that kind of thing.  Breads: Buying bread from a supplier means you'll have to slack (thaw out) bread, as it probably comes in frozen, if it's fresh, you're in early to bake. (Early, like 4 am)  Veggies: All have to be sliced and panned, for each days service.  Sauces: Prepped and/or cooked each day.  General Line Setup: Rotating stock, checking for freshness, getting ready for the day.  If you have any specific questions down the line, I'd be glad to help. I'm a trained chef, currently a food safety manager and supervisor, been working in the restaurant industry for 25+ yrs, from no star to four star.   Depends on the restaurant, and the menu.  In our generic restaurant, every morning you would need to do recipes. Things like sauces, soups, gravies, desserts. Any thing that would need cooking. You don't want to have to do that during service. (That wouldn't be the case in a restaurant that was very fine dining, where a lot of sauces and such are prepared from scratch, to order.) You would also need to do set-ups. Things that you are going to use frequently through the day. Maybe you garnish a dish with slices of red pepper, you would have to cut enough slices of red pepper to complete the amount of plates you expect to sell that day. You would also need to do flow-through and line set up. That would be putting all of your ingredients on the line, making sure everything is set up for the upcoming day's business, making sure your ingredients are fresh. (The things you need on the line probably need to be prepped as well. Whether sliced onions for sandwiches, or pre-made entrees like chicken cordon bleu, for example)  This is a very generic overview. Without information about what sort of restaurant and what kind of menu, I can't get more specific than that.   Sticky pans. There are a couple of methods of pan release when baking cakes. It depends on what sort of cake you are making. Most importantly, you should have a non stick cake pan without dings, dents, rust, scratches, pocks or debris.  For most cakes, you can use a spray release like Pam. If you follow directions when baking, let it cool slightly before releasing, it should pop out fairly easily.  As cake recipes rise in sugar content, they become a bit stickier. For higher sugar content cakes, like rich chocolates or cakes with fruit baked with or in them, you should use a coating of cold butter before putting the batter in the pan. If your cakes still stick using the butter method, try a light dusting of flour after coating with cold butter.  Cutting wax paper in a circle the size of the bottom of the pan will work well, make sure that you have the shiny side up.   Also, never lift a cake out of a pan. Allow to cool, place a plate over the top of the cake pan, invert, tap the bottom and the cake should release cleanly.   I was a visitor before I became a resident. If you held a gun to my head and made me complain about something, I would point out that the property taxes are pretty high on beachside...but that's it.   Have fun! I hope you enjoyed your stay!   Remove the nails using a pull block. (A small shim or small block of wood that you put under the head of your hammer before using the claw to pull them out.) Assuming your walls are gypsum or plaster or drywall, get a tub of drywall joint compound, or wall spackle, and fill the hole. (If wood walls, use wood putty, if stone walls, you live in a cave, don't worry about it.) After drying time, sand, then repaint with match paint, or repaint wall.    Yep, there are fetishists of all types, but they fit my example, I think.   I went to see him in Tallahassee. Couple of good friends, a whole lotta whiskey, prepped for a great night.  Got there early, decent seats, smaller venue. Gonna be a good show.  Opening act comes out.  Blown away. It's The Derek Trucks Band. (Here's a favorite of mine, [I'd Rather be Blind, Crippled, and Crazy](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSbcpLLadX0), it's got a 15 second no-skip ad, but it's the best live version of that song that I know of. L 6:22)  Stole the show. Outstanding performer, super fun show.  Almost forgot that Eric Johnson was up next. His show, while still amazing, was far less satisfactory for me compared to the discovery (for me) of this new thing.  Unfortunately, I suppose I left that night less of a fan Eric Johnson. I still like what he does a bunch, and this song is my favorite of his.   Code is 166 KA. That's a champion Katana then.   Yep, Scarborough, isn't it? My dad worked that one this year.    I know, it was very confusing. I know it when I see it...lemme see.  How about this?   Some women that I think are big, but not necessarily fat.

The word fat gets thrown around a lot. Maybe too much.   I have loved me some big girls. I know big girls that are fabulous, and delicious, and amazing.  But fat, in my opinion, implies a controllable situation. Not big boned, not large women, not beg girls, but *sloppy* ones. Girls that don't take care of themselves. Girls that are big in the all the wrong ways. I don't know how to accurately describe the difference, but every man here knows what I'm talking about.  Short answer: Being a big girl may decrease your chances in the dating game, but in no way is going to keep you from being successful. Being *fat* as in not caring about your weight, accepting your bigness and piling on bad diet choices on top of it because it doesn't matter any more...that kind of fat, is a huge turnoff to me, and to most guys I think.   Restaurant style french toast? Hmmm. You need thick sliced white bread for one thing. The batter mix is the same, but the biggest difference is in the cooking. Most of these joints are cooking on flattop grills that keep a real consistent heat. Best results at home are going to be found with a flat top griddle. Barring that, try a pan way bigger than you need, cook one piece at a time, make sure that your pan is heated correctly, and hot before you add the toast. That should come close.   Good luck my friend. I'm well into my second year of attempting to quit. Two weeks ago, right about when you started quitting, I had well manicured nails, longer than I wanted them. (Got in the way of playing guitar, and I kept cutting myself with them!) I had a rough night, and without really thinking about it, chewed/gnawed/gnarled/ripped/bit/crunched every millimeter of them away.  This was probably the fourth or fifth time that this happened.  Take it day by day, and don't give up, because you will probably backslide a time or two.   Seriously, good luck to you, and everyone else fighting this ridiculous habit. There is every reason in the world to not do this. So do it. Do it for cosmetic reasons, because we know what our fingers look like; that's why we hide them. Do it for the health of your hands. You're two weeks in, probably no infections or redness anymore? It's nice, isn't it? Keep at it.   Terrible story, poor little girl. First time this American has heard it.   And it's also terrible that the reporter researching this could possibly have to face charges for this. Hope UK cops and judges aren't quite as dense as our US ones.  Have to point out a few things though. The "Gateway" drug comparison doesn't hold water. Many studies have shown that marijuana use does not necessarily lead to harder drug use. There is correlation, but no causation. The same is true about porn. Those that actively search for child porn have looked for other porn types before. This does not mean that the use or search of other types of porn will lead to violent child porn.   I fucked a one-legged redneck meth addict girl. Does that count? Cuz she couldn't.   If it is an open gear tuning machine, that might be possible. Are you sure that it's not just the string slipping? When you put the string on, wrap the first coil of the tightening process over the top of the string coming out of the hole in the tuning peg, this will keep the string taught on the peg.   Okay BrandNew...  What kind of guitar? Electric? Acoustic? Classical?   You were having a hard time with the G *string* I assume. You say that the *thing* is clicking, let's assume you mean the tuning peg, or tuning machine.   When it clicks, is it happening at the tuning peg at the top of the neck, or somewhere else?  And, did you just recently string it, or re-string  your guitar?    There was still plenty of that, I was just lucky to know some very cool people.   Hope it's a good show. I've seen him twice.  First time, in Tampa, he was so damn drunk, they had to bring a stool for him to sit on, which he promptly fell off of. Show went about 40 minutes before Bob walked off. Terrible.  Second show, much later, was amazing, other than the fact that Bob wore some sort of metallic silver suit and the shine coming from the spots reflecting off of him made him damn near invisible, but an amazing show.   Another great song! This one resonated with me after I became a father for the first time.    That one, and The Times They are A Changin are probably my favorite to play from his early career. Both are just timeless, and seem to speak to me at different times in my life in different ways.   I've played guitar for almost 30 years now. I picked up my Dad's Gibson one day out of curiousity, I might have been about 13 or 14. After a couple of weeks of just messing about with it, I decided I wanted to really learn how to play.   I found two books in my Dad's music collection.  Mel Bay's Guide, and Bob Dylan's Best of Songbook for Guitar  I learned how to play guitar by learning how to play Blowin' in the Wind. And Maggie's Farm. And The Time's They Are a-Changin'. And Like a Rollin' Stone. And Chimes of Freedom. And Knockin' On Heaven's Door. And Don't Think Twice. And so many more.  So many high school parties, sitting around playing Bob Dylan, (and a whole lot of other 60's hits, as those were the songbooks that my Dad had...it was a dark time, before the internet.) and having singalongs with good friends. Everyone knew Dylan, it was what our parents were listening to at home. Good times with good friends, and I still play many of those songs when I'm feeling a little homesick.  Happy Birthday, Bob. Thanks.   I'm no scientist either, but the one thing that I know is that a lot of what we are getting exposed to science-wise, isn't science at all, but a massive disinformation campaign. Both sides of the argument are guilty of this, but it seems like the pro-GMO side is skewing the science more than the whole food movement.  My family and i are going to err on the side of caution on this one, and are trying to limit our exposure to GMOs until more is known.   Probably use the same strings.    To replace the nut, you will have to remove the strings completely. Depending on the type of guitar, this may cause some tension problems. You may want to have this pro repaired if you're not handy at guitar tech.   To check a pan of ground beef, when you think that it is close to being done (after the fat looks clearer, if you can tell that), scoot everything over to one side of the pan, and try to get a temp reading in the middle of the pile. Generally, with loose meat like ground beef, assuming that you're stirring and mixing, if one part is at 165 f, then all of it should be at temp.   Thermometers. [Here's a handy-dandy chart for you](http://www.extraordinarybbq.com/bbqbasics/meat-temperatures/), (That previous sentence is a link to it.) Covers the basics. Do some more research on temperature charts, and you should be okeydokey for the future.    You have to stop what you're doing. Someone is going to catch you, and they might just fuck you up for your trouble.   Why allow the tornado in the first place? When I hear people say things like this, I hear the unmentioned comment that somehow they deserved saving, while there was a reason that everyone else was not. What did those kids do to god to piss him off? Or their parents, maybe? And so many, that were so evil, that god decided to save you, instead of them?   I play a pretty heavily wooded course as my home course as well, and the hardest thing that I had to learn is to not overreach. Sometimes your best shot is the shot that gets you out of the woods. Too many times have a thunked the second tree trying to make a shot that was harded to make than my drive was in the first place!   Simple laughter. I looked like a hairy man in a dress. But, my friend is not feminine at all, and he's happy when he's CD. (I think he looks like a dude in a dress, nice dress and all, but just a dude in a dress, but I can see that he is happy, and that's what matters most.)   Comfortable older male here, hetero, but with many life experiences that touch on some of these issues, and I consider myself well in touch with my sexuality.   What do you think about the idea of wearing girls clothes, like a dress?  Personnally, doesn't do much for me. I have, in the past, on rare occasions, worn women's underwear (at the request of a gf). I found it fun, but partially because I knew that if she asked me to wear her underwear it meant that we were going to get funky later.   What would you think if you saw yourself in the mirror dressed like a girl, and what feelings does this invoke?  I have seen myself in full women's clothes. (Halloween a couple of times, a couple of other times for other reasons, none sexual in nature) It was odd, to see myself that way, but there were no negative feelings, neither did I feel comfortable. I am a burly male type, and mostly I felt that I made for a really ugly girl.   What do you think about the idea of having a feminine body? (i.e. having breasts, long girly hair, and a curvy, womanly body)  I have long hair. I have (fantasized is not the right word, freethinking is what I call it, just imagining for the sake of imagining, sort of) about having breasts, or a vagina, and experiencing what that would be like, both on a day to day basis, and in a sexual context. I am happy with my body, and wouldn't trade it for anything, but I would like the chance to be someone else, or some other sex for a period of time.   What do you think about the idea of being socially accepted as a girl? (i.e. whether or not your looks change, everyone thinks of you as a girl)  I would not be comfortable identifying as a woman.    What do you think about the idea of having a vagina?  As a said above, I have thought of this, and I would enjoy it briefly, but wouldn't trade Big Jim Thesselwine and the Bullzac Twins for a vagina, not permanently.   Also, this is mostly irrelevant to gender, but what feelings does the idea of performing fellatio from a man or receiving anal sex invoke? (This question is directed to heterosexual men, but others are welcome to answer)  I don't find the idea of performing fellation on a man exciting at all. Receiving anal from a man, I've thought about before. (I'm a pro-prostate/anal hetero) As far as I can tell without expermenting, which I don't intend to do, I am interested in it, but not from a man. (I may try letting my wife experiment with a strap-on)   Outside of this, and I hope these answers help you somehow, I would just say that you got to get in touch with you, stop worrying so much about labels, and find what makes you happy. I have a good friend who identifies male, is hetero, and is at his happiest in a dress. Whatever makes his day, makes me happy, and the people that truly care about you will be happy when you are happy as well.   Nope. Only fairies can help other things fly, and only fairies have full open control of their flight. Some other living creatures when exposed to fairy dust have been able to self control, but others seemed to just levitate. (I would cite sources, but this conversation is weird enough.) Objects simply get lifted.   (I always did like bad girls)   I too suffer through many Tink movies with my daughter.   1. Yes, fairies need pixie dust to fly, but other creatures and inanimate objects need pixie dust to fly as well, but really should be that they need pixie dust to *levitate*, but let's forgive them as we are adults watching a show meant for little girls.  2. I also noticed this. It is a glaring inconsistency in the canon, and will not be forgiven.  (also, I'm a Vidia fan myself.)    A great book, and a very campy movie. Read it/watch it, it doesn't hold up to comparison, but a good piece of disaster fiction, either way.     This is just great photoshop.       The next time that you give her oral, when you're done, go up and kiss her, and tell her how much you enjoy doing that for her. One, the girls like that sort of thing, being told that you like doing stuff to them, and two she can experience her own taste/smell and maybe see that there is not much to worry about, and seeing you not minding it all over your face will reinforce for her how much it totally doesn't bother you.   Um, nothing.   Ice should be safe, but you really don't want to be storing things up there. That can lead to all sorts of problems. If you're looking for feeling full for a period of time, get a small plug you can wear while being out and about.   Who would have won if nuclear war broke out between US and USSR?  The cockroaches.   They make this. It's called superglue. Just a dab on the end of your fretting fingers, and it will give you some extra "callous". Remove with acetone (fingernail polish remover). DO NOT USE ACETONE WITH OPEN WOUNDS! (ouch)   Hmmm...might not be the best look for you, but maybe you should try that next time! Surprise her with nothing on but goggles and a snorkel.  In all seriousness, be careful of rubbing your eyes with your hands after sex. While all that juiciness is lots of fun, it does harbor some things that your eyes might not appreciate.   Um, I don't think you're doing it right? I don't usually use my eyes for anything more than looking....    No prohibitions against ownership in the old west, but most towns would not let armed men ride down the high street. In town residents were sometimes restricted as to what they could own though.  It would be tough to come up with a statistical counter-argument to this graph, because I don't think you could do so without creating something as equally ambiguous. Gun crime is a very complex system, and much of the arguments being talked about rely on obscuring some of the real data, while heavily manipulating other parts of it. Maybe some research into background checks and how they affected gun violence? Everyone on either side of this argument is looking for the golden bullet point that will make the other side admit that they are wrong, but I don't think that it exists. The reality of gun violence has fingers in our education system, our social reality and values, our economic disparity, our culture, our history, and our emotions.   [Here's an article that looks at the correlation between gun controls and gun violence from a different perspective.](http://thinkprogress.org/justice/2013/04/03/1811311/study-states-with-loose-gun-laws-have-higher-rates-of-gun-violence/)  [Here's an article from the Joyce Foundation that takes on a couple pro gun myths, with lots of links to backcheck and factcheck.](http://www.joycefdn.org/gunviolencemyths/)  [A bit off your topic, but a good article on the difference between causation and correlation relating to the gun debate.](http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/comment/2013/03/armed-correlations-gun-ownership-and-violence.html)   Okay.   Let's start with the graph itself. What the hell is the left axis signifying? 2, 6, 8 what? Gun deaths per thousand? People who own guns? Number of alpacas in Maine?  From right to left...  The Wild West: First, the west was not so wild. Most towns had very strict gun controls. What we "know" of the wild west comes from movies. (Bonus: The gunfight at the OK corrall was about a gang that refused to be governed by gun laws!)  The Union Led Controls: This had a lot to do with reconstruction, not with gun violence. Many households were allowed to still have hunting rifles, but not military grade weapons. Doesn't really have too much to do with overall gun violence.  Prohibition: This makes sense, if you assume that the left axis actually means something. Violence was up during prohibition, and down after its repeal. But this violence was different than the overall homicide rate in the US now, again assuming that's what this graph is trying to represent. Big difference between machine gun Kelly taking out a rival gang and a husband shooting his wife for cheating.  Post JFK Controls: I don't know much about these.  War on Drugs: The increase makes sense, but why so much up and down? Is that related to the WoD at all?   Carry laws: Curiously, these carry laws conincide with the general drop in crime that started in 1993. (The folks that wrote Freakonomics famously compared abortion rates with crime rates 20 years later and saw a very interesting correlation, look it up.) And not all states started issuing these permits.   I call bullshit. Overall, I think it might have started as a real graph that contains real info, but to use it as a pro gun argument just because you can identify a few things on a timeline to defend your argument does not make a solid case. It certainly does not tell the whole story of gun violence.   I like my discs to be whatever color stands out from green/yellow/light brown...I play in Florida, and yellows and oranges and greens just disappear sometimes. As far as stamps, I'm a dyer, I like 'em not there!   [There are places in Florida where you could be jailed for this ](http://imgur.com/SUwlLlY)   I think you already know the answer....take your man out and go buy new memories together.   Men are visually stimulated. That's why we like porn so much. It's our eyes that get turned on first. Additionally, it tells us a lot about you; how you enjoy to be pleasured, what works for you. We can use that...whether for information, or just to save to the spank bank.   Yes, yes you can. We call those Twice Crispy Treats!    Mmmmmm....language porn.    I work in foodservice, and I always wash...when I'm at work. The reasoning behind it does make sense. It's not just peeing on yourself; some bacteria and/or viruses can migrate. Either from your poo, or if you're a carrier.  Saying that, the idea of washing your hands when you're done in the bathroom is the idea of *everyone* washing their hands when they're done. A good way to help ensure that infectious diseases don't spread.  At home, no, I don't wash everytime I pee; only when I piss on myself. (And that's just a "grossness" issue, urine is sterile) I know I'm clean and disease free, and take care to remain so.  ALWAYS ALWAYS ALWAYS wash after dumping.   Half rice crispies, and half other cereal. I've used fruity pebbles, cocoa pebbles, broken up cap'n crunch.  Also, coating in chocolate is good...laying a bed of chocolate down before you put your crispies in is better...then top with caramel.   I think that products like this don't appeal to me for two reasons. One, don't like to think about menstruation. The menses are a completely natural biological process that all women experience during their reproductive lives, but it is something that men experience second hand, and it is both mystical and clinical when described to us. We don't know how to deal with women menstruating as men, and as a society, we still view this part of a woman's life as dirty, or gross.  Secondly, living in a disposable society, the idea of washing these out and reusing them relates to that dirtiness aspect, and we have been trained our whole lives to view certain things as dirty, and disposables can take the stigma away, by never having to think about it.  I'm a dude, and yes I find that idea gross, but as a member of spaceship Earth, I know how detrimental disposables pads/tampons are to the environment, and if my wife wanted to use something like this, I would support it. Easier to deal with this than the [Mooncup](http://www.mooncup.co.uk/about-the-mooncup.html) anyway you look at it though!   [Full Results](http://www.vancouversun.com/sports/Kentucky+Derby+2013+full+results/8339211/story.html)   Frustrating....I'm looking for full results as well. Nothing yet.   Played regular Thursday club round this morning in pouring rain/wind.    I was a dedicated diet soda drinker. I stopped as part of my weight loss plan for this year. I've been eating better and excercising, but I assume that stopping the diet sodas was a big part of weight gain. Why? I lost so much weight at first, and fast, when I made these changes. And more importantly, the change in how I feel was amazing.  Saying that, if you're only drinking three a week, just stop. Find your caffeine in coffee, or tea, where you can control how much (and maybe more importantly *what kind of*) sugar you put in them. I personally would recommend staying away from diet sodas just because you don't want to find them becoming too large a part of your diet, but at the level that you're drinking, it shouldn't matter.    Lots of my favorites on there.   Huck Finn - Mark Twain. Gotta love Twain. I don't think it's his best work, I like his essays and short stories, but he tells a tale well, and it's easy to read.  White Fang - London. The ultimate boys adventure book. I think that this one is a bit of a "young reader" i.e. not much to it, but a great read, great story.  Brave New World - Huxley. I think that this is a "must read" especially if you're politically minded at all. Put it on your list to read, but don't do it for this assignment unless you're looking to impress. Tough subject, very involved.  The World According to Garp - Irving. Another great story. A big read, but not impossible to communicate the story to a class. (Also a great movie, with Robin Williams in a serious role.)  They're really all good. I've read 90% of these recreationally, but I don't know what you're looking for for your assignment. Good luck, happy reading.   Having a great round at my local park, shooting well.  Throw a drive out of bounds left. Pissed. Working on my drive, been getting better, know I can do better. Throw a provisional, for practice.  Out of bounds right.  Towards a fence.  Topped with barbed wire.  That encloses a lake.  Panic.  Find disc, newest and current favorite (a banana yellow amp with a custom dye) laying juuuussst next to lake, behind fence.  Send wife to go get it.   Crispy clear film around the edges sounds like your pan might be just a tad too hot. Try turning down the heat and cooking slower.   I'm glad you were able to fix it.   One of my earliest memories is my dad being upset at me because I hadn't cleaned my toys up in the hallway, and him stomping on and breaking my Hess truck and trailer with real light up lights. (If you're over 35 you know what I'm talking about)  Dad and I have lots of other reasons why our relationship is garbage, but my mind always goes back to that.  Talk to your wife.    State the situation? I wouldn't be very comfortable going down on a girl at the dinner table, at her parents house, during Thanksgiving dinner...but if it's a sexytime situation, I'm a-goin down faster than the stock market two years ago.  My age now? When I did it the first time? How old she is? Very confused. This is something that I did in probably my second or third sexual encounter, almost 30 years ago now. And she would have to be older than 18.   It's a poem. Semi-famous in its day. It's actualy title is Old Pothead's Experimental Method. It's by Sam Abrams, a college professor and Fulbright scholar.  From Dr. Lester Grinspoons' blog:  Sam Abrams has been a Fulbright Professor of American Literature at the University of Athens and currently is Professor of Language and Literature in the College of Liberal Arts, Rochester Institute of Technology. He dropped out of academia from 1968 to 1978, during which time he was a film writer, a communal organic farmer, a casual longshoreman, a union laborer, and a public relations flack: he considers that of these, the farming was the best learning experience.  The poem was originally published in The Old Pothead Poems.  Here's his [wikipedia page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_abrams)   I've recently read an article about birthgasms here on reddit. Have you experienced this, and is it difficult for women to talk about when it happens?   Doo doo do do do.   Yeah, thanks, no spell check. I'm lost without it.   This might be part of the phenomenom as well. Testing has improved greatly over the last twenty-five years or so and we're better able to identify allergies that aren't of the *eat a peanut and die* flavor.   We take allergy awareness very serious in our restaurants. We have a clientele made up of mostly old folks, who are in the danger zone when it comes to food bourne illnesses and allergies. I understand making it idiot proof on the menus to some degree, but when a case of cashews comes in the back door to be stocked and I see a big sticker that says Warning: CONTAINS NUTS it makes me wonder what sort of stupidity had to happen to make the manufacturer have to put that on there.    I've done a lot of reading on this, and fingers point to everything under the sun. Personnally I believe that there is a connection between food additives and food allergies. There is little to no direct evidence showing this, but food allergies have grown in our society right along with the massive increase of artificial colorings and flavorings, with the increase of steriod and antibiotic use, and the increased reliance on pesticides/herbicides in our industrial farming.  Exposure, or lack of exposure, may be an issue as well, as many children that develop food allergies come from homes that eat a diet heavy in processed foods, so that the exposure that they do get to the common allergens (wheat/gluten, soy, dairy, eggs, fish/shellfish, and treenuts) are processed so much. Again, there is little evidence, or studies, that point to this as a cause.  I don't have the link, but I did read about a study that showed that children who were fed a whole food diet were the most unlikely to form any food allergies at all, and when the mother consumed a whole foods diet as well, the chance of food allergies became almost nil.   It's incredibly difficult to get good information about our food anymore. The foxes are running the henhouse as it were, with the government authorities who are in charge of making sure our food is safe, true, and healthful are run by industry executives across the board. There is less monitoring in our food service manufacturing now than at any time since the early 1970's, and that directly correlates with the increase in food bourne illnesses that have sickened and killed people in these last 40 years.     I work in the foodservice industry, and am in charge of producing allergy information menus for our restaurants. Food allergies are growing in leaps and bounds, and it's important to get correct information to our customers so that they can avoid allergens, and so that we can avoid lawsuits.  Saying that, it makes me crazy to have to point out that a peanut butter and jelly sandwich contains nuts.   I understand pointing out hidden gluten, or eggs, or shellfish in recipes that the customer might not automatically assume were there, but if you have a nut allergy, then "Don't eat nuts!" seems like pretty good advice. Do you really need a warning?   Bastards. Assuming the story checks out that is. If it was me, I would be turning on Daddy Kick Ass Power, and probably be going to jail in addition to losing my kid. I hope they get out of this without too much more nonsense.   Go for it. The wife and I enjoy that one, gives the female a feeling of control, of dominance, she can grab my head, twist my ears, and fuck my face for a change!   He's asking because he wants you to do it...so he doesn't have a problem with it. He obviously finds you sexy and attractive....so who's judging you but you?  Turn the lights out, or compromise; through a leg up on the couch and put him to work.   No, because I've done it. There's so many benefits from ideas like these. Spices things up for sure, shows an adventurous side, and the learning, if you can keep your head and pay attention, is invaluable.   You need to ask your woman, not Reddit.   Go to her. Now. Tell her hot fuckin' hot it was to watch her finish herself off. Tell her that whenever she's ready and comfortable that you would like to pay more attention to her masturbating so you could see what it is that she likes. Follow through. Take fuckin' notes.   Sex is a strange thing; most of us can do it, but only a few of us take the time to get really freakin' good at it.   I make most of my decisions based on human interaction with a possible employee, but adding what I can find online can help me get a better overall picture of the person that I'm talking to, and direct some questions that might get them to open up about themselves.   I have once in the past confused two people because of similar names, but most of the time I do the online check almost immediately after talking to someone so I can use all the info that I have to make sure that I'm stalking the right person.  I don't agree that google searching in this useage is because of cowardice, but more because we live in a world where people share more of themselves online than when in person, especially with a stranger. Stalking out their digital profile is no substitute for social interaction, but it is a wealth of information when you're trying to make a decision about someone that you just met.     I caught that, and appreciate it.    I didn't say that, but I would look to see if I could infer what your recreational drug of choice would be. Big difference between a pothead and a meth-head.   It wouldn't be too hard to put the two together...but I'm also not currently looking for a job! I would delete a whole lot of Reddit and Facebook and others first thing before beginning a job search.    That is an issue. Hard to prove though, unless the employer is stupid enough to either admit that they check FB as part of the decision making process, or something equally as stupid...admitting that they don't hire pregnant atheist muslims.   I keep a "real name" social media site, and a real one for my real friends. Makes things a little easier, unless I forget to give out the right one to the wrong person.   It's not always easy. But most of the time I get an applicants social # or email as well, adn that can narrow things down as well. Middle names help with common names as well, so does knowing how to use Facebooks terrible search function.   That's why I like it here.   Manson is actually a well-spoken and intelligent guy. Look up some of his interviews; he's far more than his public persona. Hate his music, but I think I would have a nice time chatting with him.  The Biebs, however, I get the impression that he's as one dimesional as it gets without being in geometry class. I don't think he has a thing to offer anyone, outside of his inevitable dissapperance.   I'm surprised when someone doesn't have a facebook page, or when I can't find one (nicknames or fake names on page) but a simple google search gives me a wealth of information to sift through. When you fill out your app, I have your full name (check arrest records, check for other social media sites), I have your address (check out where you live to get an idea of your previous income and current financial situation), and I have your past employers (google search employees name plus previous employer can sometimes turn up any positive or negative feedback, either posted by the applicant, or by a supervisor, coworker, or customer).   You'd be surprised how much you can find out. Try it on yourself, or a friend that you have that info on, and see what's public out there. I do, once every couple of months, just to see what my digital profile is like.   This is how and why terrorism works. As soon as I saw the bombs go off my first thought was for the victims, but immediately following was concern about how my government was going to react.  Though to be true to form, once we found out that the bombers were Chechen, we should have invaded Switzerland.   Add alliteration:  "Soon I'll be stopping *by* to grab my things and say good*bye*"   Were they weighing themselves before and after puking? Seeing how many pounds of sex toys they could insert at once? You throw confusing parties....I like that.   As an employer, I would never ask for your fb password. But, you should know that I absolutely will check your facebook when considering you for a position. Protect yourself! When looking for a job, ensure that your profile is set to private, and that I can't see photos of you using illegal drugs, complaining about how messed up your financial situation is, or comments that show you are a racist/sexist/militant/etc.   Welcome to the 21st century. Douche. Change your handle, you're giving atheists a bad name.   Start looking at flavor wheels.  Did a quick google image search on [flavor wheel](https://www.google.com/search?q=flavor+wheels safe=off hl=en tbm=isch tbo=u source=univ sa=X ei=gq5yUfWcIoiK9QTIyoCQAg ved=0CDgQsAQ biw=1680 bih=923#imgrc=_) just to show how much information is available out there to you. Do some experimentation with searching (your ingredients) flavor wheel. It's a handy tool, and good for inspiration as well.   I've read Borimi's comments on this, which are well thought out and better written than my response. What I mean by not so much about slavery might have been better said as not only or not specifically about slavery. Bormimi puts it quite well when he says "slavery wasn't the spark which started the war, it is the overwhelming common denominator underlying the factors which caused the war."  I don't think that Lincoln used slavery as *only* a foreign policy tool, but it certainly was used that way.   I agree totally that any argument that you have about the Civil War are going to be wrapped up in the cloak of slavery, the states rights issue was about the states individual rights to have slaves or not. When I hear people say that the Civil War was about slavery, I envision Lincoln as some sort of super hero swooping in to free the slaves, and I don't think that history really bears that out. This could easily degenerate into an argument (It's **State's Rights!!**, no, it's the **State's rights to keep slaves!!**) but I just wanted to express that slavery wasn't the *reason*, but obviously it was the underlying current that this particular piece of history swims in.      I thought they were all good ones.     Justification in war is generally decided by the victors, who often write the history.  Slavery. Not so much. Lincoln believed that blacks should have equal rights, even though he was on record as saying that he believed they were lesser beings than whites. Short answer? Slavery was a tool that was used by Lincoln and his White House when trying to prevent foreign powers getting involved in the Civil War. Other countries had already outlawed or curtailed slavery throughout most of the industrialized world, and by making the war about slavery, other countries had to consider how they would be perceived supporting a rebellion that was about the right to keep slaves. The civil war was started in ideation because the states wanted to have self-determination, while the Fed Gov't felt that it could overrun states rights in certain instances, *such as slavery*.    Preserving the Union was far more important than slavery itself. Preserving the Union might as well have been political code for 1, I'm not gonna go down as the president that lost the south, and 2, we can't exist comfortably without the food and materiel that the South provides. (Textiles, tobacco, raw cotton, and many foodstuffs.) The industrial North would have to import all those things from what would become a foreign country.  Let's use Syria as an example. It doesn't matter as much what happens during the war as the result. If Assad wins, and continues his reign, what will be remembered a hundred years from know is how a brave and beleagured Assad was able to hold off the rebel hourdes and defend his country against those that wished it harm. If the rebels win....history will be theirs to define.   Own it. It's yours. Especially if you're good at it. Bassists and guitarists are a dime a dozen (and you get two bassists free with any purchase) but a banjo picker that knows what he's doing is worth a damn or two.   It's perfectly fine as is, because it is. This man likes to see that chocolate starfish standing out from the rest of your buttskin. No woman should want to take that simple pleasure away from us. In fact, why don't you look into dyeing Sauron's eye a darker color! Make your balloon knot a dark purple! Embrace your puckered starfish! Celebrate your ham flower! Love your rusty bullet hole!

Complained about it "not tasting right". Shot on over to do my thing, talked to her, the only thing she could say is that it "just didn't taste right". So I go to the bar and have the 'tender make me another one, stood right there and saw it get made. Took it over to the table and presented it to the customer. She says that it tastes just like the last one!  I tell the lady that I stood there and saw it get made, and that I was sure that it was Stoli and water.   She says that she's had them before, and it doesn't taste like she remembers.  After mentally thowing my hands in the air, I restated that I was sure that it was Stoli and water, just like she ordered...  She asked me what flavor of Stoli that I used.   Late tonight, had a trio of old white folks walking out the door just as an african-american couple walked in. Little old lady, about 80, maybe five feet tall, walks right up to the black fella, probably 6'8, grabs his belly and tells him "You look just like my son!" Without explaining why this makes sense, they ask him (of course) if he played basketball. Turns out he played for UCF, and the litle old lady says that her son also played for UCF, years earlier than this guy would have been in school. After chatting basketball for a minute or two more, they went their seperate ways, and I caught the eye of the big guy, and he kinda rolled his eyes at me. The little old lady turns to her husband as they walk out the door and says...  "6'8 and he played power forward? He's fulla shit!"  Surreal.       Sex outside the bedroom can be very cool. The wifey and I are all middle aged and shit and still like gettin' it on in sketchy semi-public places. We have a date with a park down the road next Monday afternoon actually....gonna do some "bird watchin'".    Maybe by his room-mate? Either way, that's one hell of a walk of shame.   Just a quick run like that, might be best to put an ad in our [local newspaper want ads](http://creative.news-journalonline.com/classified/) or in our local trashrag, [the Pennysaver](http://www.floridapennysavers.com/new_smyrna_beach/). Short of that, the only service that I know of that you could possibly use are more of a booze cruise/charter boats that are gonna run 50-100 bucks, and stay out for a few hours.   Fixing is my thing, and the additional income could come from purchasing the rental property...but I see what you're saying. Can't make a play on it for lack of funds....love my place, hate to think about leaving.   We've got another six months or so on our current lease, and the landlord situation is a little, let's say unprofessional. Landlord that we deal with has sold the property previously, to a family member, who does not live in town. Current landlord makes all the decisions, and is the kind of guy that would work with emotion first, and economics second...having another lease drawn wouldn't be a big deal, I think, as long as the sale wasn't imminent.  I didn't figure I could do anything to try and secure the property, but I would be a dope for not asking!  Want to get this figured out so that we can make long term plans. Doing credit counseling/building up our credit score...we do have a long term plan to buy, we just are worried about how soon we may have to move, and what that will do to our finances.  Thanks for replying!   San Marino burned down or something, didn't it? The new Malibu condo is there, or next door?   There's an encampment behind the Indian River plaza, but other than that, don't really see them like I see them on Canal.   We just found out that our landlord is putting our building up for sale. It's a three unit condo, beachside, 1650 sqft or so per, 3/2, brick and mortar. Our landlord has been very friendly for us, keeping us in our unit for less (way less) than market value. (We pay 1k/mth, going rate should be 1500 or so, if not higher.)   We're concerned with new owners coming in, where we live is developing and growing, and we're just not sure what our plans, long and short term, should be.  So, a couple things you guys could answer for us?  Short term: Three unit, priced at 400K. Property is zoned res only. Possible income about 4500/mth or so. How quick is this thing gonna sell. I know you don't have crystal balls over there, and the market in FL is rebounding, but still shaky, but does this sound like a clearance sale to you, or are we going to have a minute before we have to worry about it selling?  Mid Term: What are my rights as a renter? Assuming this place does sell, how long do I have before the new landlords can demand higher rents, or demand we vacate? Do they purchase any lease agreements when they purchase the property? Meaning, do they have to honor a lease signed by the previous owner? (This is important, our landlord is *very* cool, and if our plans needed to include us staying there, he could set us up with a lease for three or five years, at our rate, with no fee for early vacating.)  Long term: What's our next step? Single wage earner, paycheck to paycheck, minimal savings, minimal credit history. Is it even worth it to start looking for a home to buy, or should we be looking at another rental? (Info: Income (on paper) 40k/yr, own investment property only worth about 10k, about 5k in savings currently, both wife and I have *ahem, questionalble credit....(default credit card - her, and student loans - me.))  Thanks in advance for anything you guys can suggest to ease our minds and help us plan our future! And, I hesitate to ask because it seems so far fetched, but is there something like a Small Business Loan that I could get hold of (if I could even qualify for such a thing) and make a play at the property ourselves?   Thank you!! This is why I reddit!   Interesting place. A wide spot on the road....I-75, just north of Tampa. Was hitching out of Tallahassee one summer, and got picked up outside Lutz by a dude and his family in a short bus that had been upconverted to a camper bus. Spent the whole hour and a half ride into St. Pete listening to this dude explain how magic crystals could be ground up, dropped from planes into the atmosphere, and that would prevent hurricanes from ever forming again. He had some very convincing pictures, drawn in pencil on notebook paper, that explained how it worked. He was very adamant about how it needed to happen, but it never was going to...."because of the niggers and the gays." A ride I was glad I was still alive to see the end of. I made eye contact with the wife on my way off the bus, and I couldn't tell if I saw pity for me, either because I had to talk to her crazy old man, or because I didn't understand how magic crystals worked, or maybe, just maybe, a pleading look, begging for help, some rescue unlooked and unhoped for from her madman of a husband.  She haunts my dreams.   Shhhhh! I'm trying to get more cool people to come to Florida!   Been through Polk. It's no different than most of middle FL. Ever been to Lutz?   Yeah, that's gonna be hard to do. Depends on what kind of frisbee you want to do. Simple recreational frisbee easier than a regulation Ultimate or Disc golf disc. (Because of the plastic blends used in manufacture.)    Yeah, no career as a travel agent for me.   It's basically all the parts of FL that aren't advertised. Orlando? Crack heads, murder capital of FL. Tampa/St. Pete? Meth. Robbery. Rape. Clearwater Beach? Ought to call it hypodermic beach, also the headquarters of Scientology. Panama City Beach? The beach is nice, the rest of the panhandle is backwards southern rednecks. Miami? They'll eat your face off, but only *after* they rape you.    Some parts of it aren't that bad. No, really.   English and spanish, from FL.   Post here...lots of new dads, and second and third dads here. Also, get your wife a copy of What to Expect When You're Expecting, and read it yourself. Great book, very informative.   What's the design? (How difficult?) Single color, or mutliple?   I'm a rocks drinker. A good whiskey, poured over ice, swirled, allowed to sit just a minute or two before enjoying, is a delight. I personally don't "add" any water, other than my melty ice.   Ahhh, rape-dancing. It was very popular in my high school.   Our home course is short, technical one. We warm up on 18, no practice baskets. Practice upshots from the basket at 18 to the basket on hole 9...got to talking to some club members, and we talked about doing a day where we shoot from the previous hole's basket on to the next hole. (Hole out 1, and then shoot from that spot for 2, and so on.) Would work for our course, and sounds like a lot of fun. We may try it soon.   If there's a downside to playing disc golf in FL, besides the unbearable heat, how much water you have to carry, bugs, spiders, alligators, and wind/rain/hurricanes, it's that you have some real interesting ground cover colors....I throw a lot of white and black and blue discs to make sure I can see them in the green, greenish yellow, yellow, brownish yellow and brown we play in.    All year disc golf in FL...but getting ready for windy spring early summer with this:  Driver(s):  171g Champ Beast (beat in, forearm go to disc. Reaching just shy of 300 with this.)  172g Champ Beast (softer beat in, back hand control disc. Right about 300')  177g Champ Beast (newest, throwin in the wind. Can boom this one a bit further.)  177g River (glide like an eagle, headwind or tailwind. Love this disc. Can hit 275-300')  178g Amp (newest disc, not sure if right for my windy bag)  Mids:  175g Champ Shark (Beat in, forearm approach and finesse disc)  180g Champ Shark (softer beat in, for shot shaping and longer approaches)  Putts:  2X Anodes, 180 and 178   That, sir, is fuckin' creepy.    I whistle, happy tunes, and smile and say hi to everyone that I see....generally helps. But, I still get "the look" every now and again.   I hope so, it's getting re-reported too much.   It was announced today that Andrew Lincoln may be quitting the show. That might change a few things.   Survivors.    [Here. Enjoy!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHac2pJaPUc)    Married three years, together 10 more.  I would at least consider it, and talk to her about it. The issue wouldn't necessarily be sex, but I would want to know that there were some emotional protections in place. (Not worried about her fuckin' somebody else as I am her fallin' in love with somebody else.)   When you want your haircut, you go to the barber.  When you want your teeth cleaned, you go to the dentist.  When you want your balls drained, why on earth wouldn't you go to a professional?  And you had to go to the barber the first time, and you were probably scared then. You had to go to the dentist the first time, and that was probably scary, too.  Do what feels right for you. But don't cloud up this decision with a lot of nonsense. Do it if you want. Don't if you don't. Whoever she is, she's done this before. She'll be gentle. And understanding, and won't make fun of you.  My opinion? I lost my virginity to a girl just a year older than me that (if it's even possible) knew less about sex than I did. The idea of your first time being special is mostly a myth. It's usually a misinformed fumbling occasion marked by unneeded embarassment and stickyness.     For sure.   Nowhere near that fast, but a fun story.  I had been playing with a couple people on and off, shitty bar gigs, whatever. Didn't work out, drifted, lost contact.  My friend (percussionist) and I moved, out of state for work and school.  We ended up working at the same shithole restaurant, and one night after work, we're sitting around outside, having a ...smoke, and my friend says fuck it, we should start a band.   Work sucks, extra money doesn't, but we laughed it off, we don't know anybody in town, blah blah blah.   My buddy (percussionist) and I (singer/songwriter/guitar) are catching a ride home that night with this dude, and dude says we have to stop by his place to ...have a smoke.  We roll into his apartment, and there is this red-headed fuck sleeping on the couch. He wakes up when he hears us moving around in the kitchen, and it's my buddy from the other state (lead guitar) that we haven't seen in about two years.  First words outta his mouth? We need to start a band.  We jam a few times, nothing really, and start thinking about finding a bass player. We get this guy over, and he's some kind of jazz/fusion guy that can't fit with southern progrock, and after deciding he ain't working, my buddy (lead guitar) says that he thinks he know someone.   Give him a call, he lives two streets over from the band house. He says he knows a drummer. They both come over.  We all work on a jam, hits that sweet spot where you can feel it right, and for the next six years we make beautiful music together, scorching the scene in our little town.  Serendipity was considered for a band name.   I did not even consider smart-people only orgies. I may just start organizing those, and to hell with the birth control.   Birth Control in the water.  You gotta have a license to fish, but anybody with a vagina and a donor can have a kid?  In the face of severe overpopulation just a generation or two away, and idea like this could be revolutionary.  Consider that Russian scientists have announced that they may be able to "curtail againg" by 2050 or so, and most scientists agree that the human lifespan is going to skyrocket in the next 100 years or so.  Consider that in many parts of the world, absolutely no care is given to our genetics. Any body can breed. Maybe this isn't the best idea? Given that many of our best and brightest are too busy to start families, and it's the portion of our society that least needs to be breeding that seems to be the most productive at it.  Birth Control in the water. Go to the doctor, get a physical, get screened for genetic diseases, get a license, go to the pharmacy, take a pill that makes you fertile, have children.  The singlemost large problem with this idea is that some government has to be in charge of this, and that's almost never a good idea. But something has to be done, or not only will we overpopulate, we will be surrounded by the worst that society has to offer us.   It's not gonna make you feel any better about almost eating that, but that's a piece of common dish room scrubby made of steel. Real common for those to end up in pots and pans, that are then used for cooking, and the piece of metal makes it into your food. Our restaurant does not allow them any longer for that reason.   There was a point where I wanted to like Merle, I really did. He came close to some kind of redemption...but even there at the end I didn't trust him...I think that he might have been doing what he was doing just to gain cache with Rick's group, or maybe I'm just jaded as hell.   Yeah, that'll happen.   Such a powerful scence, but I for one am glad to see Merle gone.    One of my favorite places...lol. Tacos carnitas for the win...shitty wine based margaritas, though. The family hits that place up once a month or so...I'm a chef/manager, so I like to eat at home as often as possible. :) One of the best joints on beachside, and just a bit down the road from my house.    In between the bikers and the breakers (Spring break starts on the heels of bike week) this is the least favorite time of year here for me. Another month or so, and things get nice around here. Good summer crowd, but they stick to the beach, and the bars are crowded, but not with assholes, ya know? Just interesting folks. Next to early fall (when everyone goes home and the town is empty) summer is my favorite time of year here.   Norwood's is still there. I've been here a bit, and I don't know the San Marino at all. You wouldn't recognize beachside...condos, condos as far as the eye can see...almost all the way down to Canaveral National Seashore.     You should have been here for the Casey Anthony nonsense....you would have loved it, and forgive me for my yankee comment. Most transplants are from up north, I just get used to calling 'em all yankees.   As far as Warnos goes, did you see the Discovery Channel mini-doc on that case? The woman who played Wornos is the wife of one of my good friends and ex-employees, and is also a retired *original* American Gladiator!  Bike week is pure hell for most of us down here. Fake ass bikers with creases in their leathers, taking a vacation from their podiatrist practice to come play big boy in my little town...most of them don't know how to drive well anyway...cruisin' at three in the morning, knowing that they're the same people calling the cops when someone in their neighborhood is playing their radio too loud at nine at night...sheesh. Rant over   Biased opinion for sure, but they really are the best steaks in town. Real wood grill, imported mesquite from TX, nice bar, best happy hour in town, it's not a bad place.  The NSB can be great. It gets better when all the (no offense...) yankees go home. (Don't worry, give it a few weeks and you'll be on island time too.)   Okay...never go to the Outback again...keep going down the road to the Publix plaza on the right hand side. There's a local steakhouse there. (Full disclaimer: I work there...it's a job, so I hate it, but it really is the best steak in town.) Called the New Smyrna Steakhouse. Enjoy!   Careful, or you'll get to watch that crane eat those lizards! Not the best thing before breakfast! Manatee is awesome, we take the kids there every now and again. (We're true islanders...we generally don't come across the bridges if we don't have to...lol). On your cruise down Canal, just off Canal St on Sams Rd is the NSB historical museum. If you're into that sort of thing it's a neat little place with some history about our groovy little town.   Canal St. can be alright. Check out Ruth's for breakfast...skip it for lunch. (Ruthies is on the west end of canal...don't know which side you're on.) Big Joe's on the corner of Dixie Hwy and Canal for the best subs in town, or check out Maloney's for lunch and cold beer. (Ask for Michelle, tell her Joe sent ya) Feel free to PM me for anything NSB related....I love our little beach town. I've been here less than a decade, but I've grown to love this place, and know it well.   Welcome! Glad to have another Redditor in the NSB. Bums in your yard? Should have chosen beachside!  Cool things to do in NSB? Meh... Drive on the beach, do it at least once, then never do it again, it'll wreck your car.  Check out the lighthouse at Ponce Inlet. Long drive, small admission, worth it for the view.  South end of the island is part of Canaveral Natl Seashore. Go there. It's stunning.  Lots of park, and outside stuffs to do. I second Beachside Tavern for good shows. Cheap, and cold, beers too.   That's exactly what's its like. The chopstick is the structure to support all the hot glue. Shaping the glue is more like layering the glue. Adding in seperate layers to get the shapes that you want. It's easier than it sounds...I've made a fairy one for my five  year old girl, and a wizard one for my eight year old boy. Super easy, done in an evening, and I made hand-made paper boxes for them as well.   Prepare to be awesome, Dad.  Homemade Magic Wand/Princess Wand/Fairy Wand/Wizard Wand  You will need:  * Wooden chopsticks, like from the chinese takeout.  * A glue gun. Glue too.  * Spray paint. Pink, green, yellow, brown, you know.  * Sparkly shit. Glitter, ribbon, beads.  * Just a little bit of time.  Break off your chopsticks so you only have one. Get yer glue gun, and start gluing. What you need to do here is use the glue to shape the chopstick into a wand shape. Nice and thick on one end for little hands, dull down the sharpness of the skinny end so nobody loses an eye. Use beads or broken pieces of the other chopstick to help this shaping. Just build glue on top of glue until you get the look you want. (Pro-tip: Using wax paper, or latex gloves, you can mold the glue. But only right in between it being magma hot and completely set.) Once you get a shape that you're happy with, get your spray paint on, hit it with a couple of colors, make it bright, make it right. Brown for wizards/witches, pink and green for fairies and princesses. Get sparkly. Sprinkle glitter on that thang while it's still spray paint wet. Tie a ribbon around that thing. Personalize, accesorize, right? Go the extra mile and box it up all fancy-like, and prepare for the awesomeness of "Thank you Daddy!"     Male in 10+ LTR.  She does if I ask. Not a huge thing for me, I prefer her nekkid. But I do like it when she does. Would like it more if it was spontaneous from her end, but if it's something that you want, don't just ask for it, talk to your girl and see how she feels about it, tell her how you feel about it, and see what happens.   I don't need it bald, but as a frequent giver of oral, I really appreciate when the girls keep everything neat and trim and out of my way...makes my life just a little bit easier. I can deal with hairy, I just prefer not having to. Bald is porn hot, but not necessary all the time.   Here in the US, cilantro refers to the leaves of the plant, while coriander generally refers to the ground up seeds of the same plant. Two very different flavors in the kitchen.    Real books will always have a place on my shelf, and I assume that there are a lot of other people that feel the same way.  What I would like to see in the future is a serious on-demand printing based book economy....where we don't have to choose from the few books that the publishers feel like producing, but can audition books online, and purchase printed copies of the books that we like, books that we have loved and lost, and eliminate the idea of a book ever being "out of print."   Girl is trying to do something, good for her, I ain't gonna hate.   Yep. Don't use RIT. They changed their formula a bit ago, and it no longer works on plastics. (Though, I have had some success in darkening colors with black RIT...).   Find Jacquard iDye poly fabric dye. You can find it in Micheal's or online. Mix one pack with one quart of water, heat to boiling, let cool until you can hold your hands on the pot without hurting yourself, and dye away. Do not use the color intesifier that comes with the dye.   Also, check out [the forums on DGCourseReview.com.](http://www.dgcoursereview.com/forums/forumdisplay.php?f=25) Plenty of info there.   Happy coloring!   There are two sides to studying how to be a pick-up artist.   The first side are those men that use those tools to bed women indiscriminately. They're in it for the game, for the conquer, and for the nookie. Many of them are the kind of guys that aren't going to call you in the morning; you are just another score to them.  But there's another side to studying how to be ultra-confident around women. It's for those of us that aren't. Many men have the tools to be a good partner to women whether it's for the long term, or just the long night, but they don't know how to act around the opposite sex, or lack the confidence in themselves to be that suave guy that we're all told we're supposed to be.  Studying the art of the pick up can help those kind of men show women that they are more than the quiet guy in the corner, making eyes at the hottie 'cross the way; it can help them be interesting, to conquer the art of small talk, and break down the walls between strangers that keep them from becoming closer.  tldr? Don't hate the player, hate the game.   I had a good friend while I was living in a university town. She was finishing her Master's and working at the restaurant that I ran.  I had many enjoyable evenings talking to her about politics, the future of genetics (her field of study), and general sciency stuff. She was a very intelligent, very well spoken young lady.  Until the men came around.  I had no interest in her, she none in me, purely friends, but the way that she would act when men she was interested in made it very difficult to remain friends with her. She could go from an intelligent discourse on current events, to that high-pitched-voice, flounce-my-hair play stupid bullshit that so many young women seem to employ.  I talked about it with her one time, and she felt that many men felt threatened by how smart she was. I responded that I thought she was smarter than that, and that the only men threatened by smart women are dumb men.  We've gone our seperate ways since, and I still see her on FB occiasionally, and it doesn't seem like much has changed. She's working on her Doctoral at another university, and her comments/posts seems to show that her intelligence has only grown, while the pictures that she posts, and the FB friends that she keeps reinforce that "dumb girl" facade.  tl;dr smart girls acting dumb to get beefneck men that will never respect a strong intelligent woman.   I am a gentleman in public, but a master in the bedroom.   Justin Bieber's last CD  Justin Beiber's new CD  Whatever Justin Beiber does next.  Or if you prefer, I'll like what I'm told to like from the hivemind of cellar dwellars.  	187
 The US air drops around Kobane resulted in 20% of the weapons going to IS. The US weapons to the "moderate" groups have resulted in 2 of 12 moderate groups defected - with TOWs and other weapons - to Nusra (similar to IS). US weapons to Sahwa (The Sunni Awakening) are also now firmly in IS hands with the mass executions.  Basically, along with the weapons given to the Iraqi army that IS looted over the past months, we've effectively armed the people we've declared war against - supposedly for a good reason. It's just been one epic fuck up.   Do you have a source for your attribution to Muhammad? Khwarijj were a group of sectarians with the explicit belief that commission of the kabair is tantamount to apostasy. You can throw the title around in a derogatory way, but it doesn't apply technically to these guys. In fact, the closest existing sect to the Khawarij would be the Ibadis in Oman...   They also separated the Christians. Christians and Sunnis were free to leave.   You will get downvoted. This sub is a cess-pool of armchair generals with a hard-on for the any and all current international conflicts.   That video of them pleading for help sure was convenient for the SAA   Very appropriate music video to go along with announcing these:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rY0WxgSXdEE   **Abdulaziz bin Khalifa al-Attiyah was found guilty in absentia by a Lebanese court of channelling financial support to al-Qaeda.**  Sounds legit /s   I'm not really qualified to have a real discussion on the topic. My only contention was that its not as simple as declaring all new celebrations prohibited (opinion held by some of mashayakh you quoted) - since there is valid ikhtilaf on whether the celebration is religious or secular in nature. I can't speak to Halloween, Mother's day, birthdays or national holidays specifically.   Also muslims had the disgusting habit of making eunuchs out of their male slaves.  Maybe. Deliberate castration is explicitly prohibited in Islam however so the carry-over cultural practice really has nothing to do with them being Muslim.    All their "state building" initiatives need to bombed too IMO.  Yes - collective punishment is the way to go. Let's teach those average Sunnis for using the resources provided by the fighting groups that control their cities /s   Something that doesn't make sense about the video is that it looks homegrown, not one of the well-edited videos usually produced by this group. The group instituted a treason-policy on people recording "your brothers" on film without state apparatus - right?    I'm not going to give a value judgement on the concept, but happy to explain it. What your right hand posses is a reference to female slaves of age.  Although Muhammad encouraged the freeing of adult slaves in general, Islam doesn't completely prohibit slavery. That doesn't mean slavery in Islam is anything like what was done to the Africans transported over to the United States by people who's religion laid down no laws with reference to slavery. Slavery in Islam is not perpetual and doesn't transcend subsequent generation. Every slave earns a wage, the wage must be paid timely and they eventually earn their freedom. It does mean that, as a general rule, Muslims can cohabit with female slaves who are of age.  As far as Muslims following the rules associated with it in modern times, its rather difficult. You get slaves by winning wars. Islam doesn't just allow you to pick up random people and declare them your slaves. You also (generally) can not enslave other Muslims - so when a Muslim extremist group fights another Muslim extremist group, they don't get to take any slaves. In the recent past, Muslims have generally been fighting other Muslims so there hasn't been a lot of associated booty or slaves.  Slavery in Islam isn't simply about sex though. Suppose you're at war, and your army kills a child's family. The child is your slave, but the majority of the world would look at rearing the child as 'adoption' and not outright slavery. In any case, the topic is a lot more nuanced.   I don't know specifically about Mother's Day. I was actually talking about the logic for prohibition of *all* secular holidays, "All celebrations which differ from the Eids prescribed in Islam are innovated festivals" - which is how I understood what Sh. Salih b. Uthaymeen was saying. Other scholars don't count non-religious festivals in the same category:  [Sh. Abdullah b Bayyah](http://en.islamtoday.net/artshow-411-3472.htm)  [Sh. Salman al Ouda](http://en.islamtoday.net/node/618)   Sh. Salman al Ouda opined the opposite. There isn't one 'right' opinion in jurisprudence.    Netanyahu was born in the United States  You're right. OP is not wrong to consider Netanyahu a native speaker. He's spent a lot of time over the course of his youth and adult life in this country.   Yep, flash some buzzwords, exploit their sympathy *for you* as they're passing by trying to get to the next class and say stuff that people generally agree with "let's not bomb people" "give peace a chance". The whole video was bullshit.   For the US, "hearts and minds" was just a strategy - that's not the case here.... People don't join extremist religious groups for no reason. These people legitimately believe they're doing something good for their community, as misguided as they may be.   If it's one thing the various factions of Islam can agree on it's that the Koran is a perfect transmission from God and has never changed since Mohammed's revelation.   Most sects believe that, sure.   They won't be welcomed. IS basically waltzed into Tikrit and Baiji. I know from anecdote and even videos of people thronging to them when they came in. Locals helped IS identify particular soldiers they despised from the army when IS executed many prisoners. Things may have changed, but Sunnis in places like Tikrit and Baiji have plenty of reasons to despise the Shi'ite army - possibly more than IS, if IS is actually not doing them too sharp.   No - they killed people associated with Sahwa and they killed certain tribal leaders. There are *a lot* of tribal leaders and vested parties.   You will quickly find religious fundamentalism after a defeat followed by years of humiliation.   If the city falls to a suicide bombing, it'll be called Kurt Kobane    IS is a fanatical upstart regime. They are recruiting thousands of disillusioned youths from Western Europe.  IS is made up almost entirely of recruits from Syria, Iraq, Turkey and Tunisia. The disillusioned youths from Western Europe form a trivial component of their standing army.    Our media needs to inflate this trivial hot-spot, let's not bring facts into this one.  3--- 3--- 3---   These stories are being told by rather questionable anonymous sources. At the same time, AI has a good reputation in the West for their reporting.    This sort of thing goes without saying yet people still act shocked. After all it's called the Islamic state, not the Buddhist state or the Episcopalian state.   [Burma/Myanmar](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013_Burma_anti-Muslim_riots) is considered a Buddhist state by both demographics and constitution.   Because things aren't as simple as our media makes it seem.   ["the death toll may be in the hundreds of millions."](http://i.imgur.com/mMBILmY.jpg?1)   When it's actually a genocide. [Proving genocide](http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/2ksk5j/hundreds_of_iraqi_tribesmen_opposed_to_islamic/clp6hyu) isn't as easy as throwing the word around meaninglessly.    but i have heard some pretty nasty things of ISIS members raping small children (even babies)   As far as propaganda goes - that's some of the nuttiest   Through the more reliable primary source:  http://www.hrw.org/news/2014/10/30/iraq-isis-executed-hundreds-prison-inmates  The article that was posted by OP is very shoddy journalism at best, complicit deceit by the journalist about a very serious international matter at worst.   If you're not Muslim, you'll be paying 5% jizya tax on your earnings. If you are Muslim however, you'll only pay 2.5% zakat tax - but, you run the risk of being drafted into the standing army. As a member of the fighting force, if you don't die, you'll be forced to fork over 20% of earnings as khums tax. Avoiding taxes with IS is like taking out a mortgage - you can pay a shittier fixed rate, or pay the lower rate with the possibility of being sucked into something much riskier. Going as a non-Muslim under a guarantee of safety is probably your best tax-bracket bet.   Why? Engineering departments are already full of virgins. Lots of them.   I've heard they do have black market stock options. They're performing a bit better than Hezbollah and the Iraqi army, with a strong upwards trend. I'm bullish on IS stock.   It's very difficult to kiss your head. Even when you're decapitated.   This is the same reason I became an alterboy at the church.   TL;DR Grassy Knolls is a phrase associated with the assassination of President Kennedy. Bibi Netanyahu is implying a presidential assassination of the president of the United States. Our media didn't care and instead focused on just the "third world" jab. Our media did the same thing when the tape leaked about the US role in government change in Ukraine. Rather than focus on the meat of the tape, we focused on the fact that a government official used the F-bomb.  I think I'm going to be sick.   Israel won't sink without the $3 billion in direct military aid. It makes up 1% of Israel's GDP. It was great to cement its existence while the country matured, but its not as significant as people think.   Bombings aren't exclusively against JN/IS. Bombings have also been directed against alleged SAA positions. During the Israel/Palestine debacle of late, Israel even attacked an SAA position on the grounds of there being a rocket mysteriously flying in from there. I wouldn't be surprised if Syrian air defense and long distance capabilities are targeted in the near future as well.   I really appreciate your insightful post - should've gotten more upvotes/visibility as its one of the rare handful of meaningful posts on this sub.   When he posted - this thread was still being bombarded. Things change once a thread makes front page...   You should edit your post. What you're referring to only happens to articles while they're still working their way up. By the time an article hits front page, a lot of the comments that make it up are pretty well-reasoned.   Well, its not like they can give the furniture to the Gazans now that their flats are completely demolished.   Probably a lot. The same way people dismiss good things they appear to have done as well. The story isn't black and white, but it's definitely a bit troubling that young impressionable minds are being recruited to blindly follow apparent leaders operating from hiding.   Fun fact, when these guys were first closing in on Baghdad (or so it seemed), the Shi'i government there ran mass executions of Sunnis accused of being "Sleeper Cells", Sunni inmates, and so on and so forth, and anti-regime Shi'ites like followers of Sarkhi. Course that wasn't covered by HP or Reuters...   Jews aren't allowed on the Temple Mount anyways under Rabbinic law either...   Nope none of that. 'Ali is a common Sunni name also btw.   Can one identify a Shi'te from a Sunni from appearance or accent?   No. The issue most people, especially in the West, don't want to touch with a ten foot pole is that the only way to do this is through the collaboration of locals. It goes back to the (now ignored) suffering of Sunnis in Iraq over the past several years under the democratically elected Shi'ite government.  Some people hypothesized that they can ask questions or ask you about something Sunni-specific. Firstly, that makes sense if you have 5-6 prisoners. It's not a reasonable way to go about things to have an interview for 200 prisoners. This also discounts that mainstream Shi'ism is a reactionary religion to the Orthodoxy. Religious texts of Shi'ites actually teach Shi'ites about the majority opinions as well - their belief is that their leaders did put on a public face as Sunnis but were secretly teaching a completely different religion. It would be rather difficult to single out Shi'ites on this alone.  What would make things easy is lining up 300 men, bringing around villagers who sympathize with you and who suffered at the hands of some of the prisoners. Have them point out the guys they like to keep alive from amongst the prisoners, guys they'd particularly want dead, etc.   People here don't like to read - so let's be clear about one thing - they aren't mass executing civilians or committing some "genocide" per this article. They're killing, en mass, people who physically oppose them, etc.  according to witnesses who said most of the victims were members of the police or an anti-Islamic State militia called Sahwa (Awakening).  Is it a war crime? Dunno enough about international law, but seems like a mass execution of unarmed prisoners would be. Is it the carte blanche murder of an entire demographic or whole generation? No.   We can rest easy that they likely died swift and painless. Torture is more the forte of the Iraqi army than these guys.   He's probably never had someone throw a rock at his head out of desperation. I'd venture to guess it has something to do with him probably not usurping or destroying other people's homes, livlihoods and even their lives. Just a guess.   It was funny. There's a place for stuff like that in Middle School - College. International politics - probably not so much.   And most of Sweden isn't Ikea either. The point was that Israel can get away with caricatures of foreign states, while foreign statesmen would have to deal with the Anti-Semite card had they done the same.   For not being cunty enough.   We should force Israeli politicians to team up with a Palestinian politician and together assemble some ikea furniture. This would promote cooperation and teamwork like never before.  But the Israeli will get to keep the furniture. The Palestinian who's home was just demolished doesn't have a place to put it - I don't think he needs it.

Please post your analysis - or cases you notice (especially if you have information about the mods involved) at http://np.reddit.com/r/isrworldnewsbiased/  In the past two days, I've seen three articles, several with karma in the 3 digit range, get removed. The recurring theme in each of those articles? They all brought up Israel - and they all did so in a not-so-positive light. I've never seen the moderation team act so swiftly and I must commend them for staying ever-vigilant. At the same time, it's a bit troubling that articles critical of Russia, China and ISIS keep seeming to get accidentally missed by their moderation team even when the articles are from (a) baseless sources or (b) opinion pieces. It's also troubling that in spite of the vigilance of the moderation team with respect to articles that point out terrorism practiced by Israelis, that they seem to keep missing other articles that their logic for removal would apply to. I've set out to help our friends at r/worldnews. They're probably just dropping the ball because they're super-duper busy.  I've started the above sub to keep track of cases like this.

 Can someone explain why The Simpsons isn't on any on demand service like Netflix?   I don't think so, at uni a lot of american exchange students seem to take a lot back home so i'm guessing they can't buy them there.    To be fair though Tim Tams are totally worth checking out.   Personally I really loved it because it was a more personal tale for Bond as it explored his history and childhood. A sentiment that is echoed in how M says "orphans make the best agents", which kind of makes you feel for Bond since he is a fairly cold and ruthless character.    The theatrical cut glosses over or completely cuts out many key characters that are integral to the actual story. The directors cut re-inserts this aspect into the film and adds layers to the developing world around the characters as well as political story threads which establish conflicts during the film. The directors cut is a 3 hour long film while the theatrical is around 2hrs 20 minutes, which gives you an idea of just how much was cut out.    Agree completely, the theatrical release of the film is completely different to the directors cut.   Was that scene even filmed? If it wasn't, would it even count as a deleted scene since it never existed to begin with?   Damn haha I had no idea!   Umm wouldn't a bike use less energy than walking or running, especially since you can just coast on a bike.    Hey bud try and list your other computer specs if you can!  Current CPU, GPU, Power Supply, RAM, Motherboard and of course what's your budget?   So is this one of the few big next gen games that actually hit its date without being delayed?    Looks like a set from Alien on board the ship Nostromo.    This one's easy!  [Moby-God Moving Over The Face of Waters](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3IXg8t8Ybs)  Used in the ending scene for Heat (1995).   You have been living a lie mate, 4th of Goblet of Fire directed by Mike Newell and the 5th is Order of the Phoenix, directed by David Yates.    So how's that RPG coming along??   Well the game is pretty much dead here in Australia. You can only really get a game of attrition and that's in the evenings on weekdays and weekends. Any other mode you are SOL since the population is dead. Playing on the US and EU servers isn't an option since the pings are too high.    I imagine we won't hear a single thing about it once Witcher 3 is released.   It sucks for me, I live in Australia and the game is basically dead! You can most likely find a game of attrition in the evening on weekdays and weekends but want to play a different game mode? Tough luck and playing on different servers is not really a viable option due to the ping affecting gameplay :/   Oddly enough I live in Australia and Avengers and Amazing Spiderman 2 both came out at least 2-3 weeks earlier than the US.   Have you actually seen any of the films?      These cars looked so cool that year, everything looked very experimental.    The assembly cut in my opinion actually makes it a much better film, while it still isn't as great as Alien or Aliens it is still a fascinating film since it continues the trend of each subsequent film having a drastically different tone. I think it's worth checking out especially for the cinematography which is truly amazing.    I always thought that the man on the balcony was hinted at being Ziegler. However there are many theories, even a theory that he may have been the main leader, the man in red.    Haha ah right, yeah VB may be iconic but it is not iconic for its taste, that's for sure!   Haha yep!   Why can't EA just put the DLC on Origin instead of running it through Bioware's website :/   My favourite use of that smile is when he burnt Piers Morgan in the studio.    Really *VB?*....   The Day The World Went Away by NIN - Terminator Salvation Trailer   Definitely Contagion. It seemed to handle the outbreak in a rather realistic manner especially when you compare it to a film like Outbreak where they end up chasing after a monkey in the forest for the cure.    This was actually pointed out to me by James Cameron in the directors commentary on the blu ray.     These pics should be cross posted to /r/WTF and copy and paste your text into the first post. You may get a lot more responses.    It actually reminded me of those weird fake adverts at the start of Metal Gear Solid 4.    Could be Australian like me where the average adult price for a movie is $17+   I'm pretty sure he is the Santa Clause that stabs Simon Pegg's hand at the start of the film.    I feel that all the Euro cars get it as they have intuitive knobs for controlling all your music/nav while being able to keep focused on the road.    Anyone here think Hugh Jackman could play a great Joel? [Here](http://images.askmen.com/1200x600/video/entertainment-and-celebrities/hugh-jackman-prisoners-interview-1085204-TwoByOne.jpg) he is in Prisoners, which is what made me think he would make a great Joel.   I agree I enjoyed the film. To be fair though, Need for Speed is probably one of the easiest games to adapt into a film since none of the games really feature an in depth narrative with fleshed out characters that are remotely memorable. So in that regard NFS was extremely easy to pull off since you only need to feature fast cars and cops.    Fillion would have been great maybe 5 or 7 years ago but he looks a bit too old now for Drake.    Yeah he was a miscast for Prince of Persia  but I don't think he was the main problem with the film.   So that means it will probably be like $1000 dollars in Australia.   I was a boom operator for two short films during uni, nothing serious mind you but man my arms and back were wrecked by the end. It didn't help that the old guy we had as an actor kept forgetting his lines.    So in the aftermath of both MH370 and now MH17 will Malaysia Airlines be able to sustain these tragedies and keep moving forward or are they already on their way out and expected to go under soon? Just curious to hear your guys opinions.    Cautiously optimistic, Uncharted on paper seems like a very easy game to make into a film but a lot of these easy on paper ideas have fucked up so monumentally in the past. It will be interesting to see how the Warcraft film turns out in 2016 as that is also a big budget video game adaptation.    What's the song you used in this vid?   While it's not a video, I have to say the [Jonestown death tape](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkookcrAnSE) is some creepy shit. Just knowing what was actively going down in that recording is way too fucked up.     The performance of a youngling.          As much as I disliked Age of Extinction (4th Transformers film) it is a lot easier to now tell who is fighting who when it comes to the transformers.    Cheers thanks mate    Hey what is the wallpaper on your laptop? Is there a 1920x1080 version of it?   Yeah I'm in the same boat man, the game was obviously quite populated at launch and a month or 2 after then I stopped playing it for a few months and now when I wanted to get back into it I can't :(       Man I love the look and feel of all of Michael Mann's films. Especially Miami Vice, Collateral and Public Enemies. I felt it gives it a much more intimate feel with the viewer.    I always thought banks were pretty strict on copyrighted images etc being used on cards. Do they just not check I guess?   Hey guys so I came across these short films that bridge the 10 year gap between the Dawn of the Apes and Rise of the Apes film. They are actually very reminiscent of The Last of Us from the setting to the way they are shot. I feel you guys would really like them, they are also very well acted!      Yeah but the question is if it's actually interesting enough to be made into a film.    Hey OP what's the setup for that racing wheel? It looks quite nifty!   Australia, ping is usually 17ms   From what I understand, they were reviewing the bike and the journo just fucked up.    Does the game scale difficulty according to the amount of players? I haven't quite figured that out yet.    I did Day 3 of the Framing Frame for the first time with 3 buddies on very hard difficulty (stealth) and it took so many fucking tries to get it right. That stage I feel really depends on the placement of the items and layout of cameras. Although doing it stealth and getting all the gold is worth the effort as it nets a nice $590k. It can mentally break you though.    The upcoming film [Fury](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q94n3eWOWXM list=PLYeOyMz9C9kYmnPHfw5-ItOxYBiMG4amq) starring Brad Pitt looks like it has some very good looking props and sets.      I hope so. I feel that Kojima would probably want to try something new as well but he is in the unfortunate position of Konami owning the IP and he is afraid they'll run it into the ground. I would love to see Kojima remake/re-adapt Snatcher for the modern era.    Man I would recognise that TV anywhere. Pioneer Kuro Plasma, one of the best!   My face is my warrant.    This trailer reminded me of the [Castlevania Lords of Shadow 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dk0PZMsk9ps) trailer. They have very similar looking aesthetics.    I have a strong feeling that it was a much cheaper effect to do the floating cubes than to have them actually transform.    Holy shit so this is my first time commenting on this sub and I think you perfectly described how I feel! I couldn't really put it into words until I read this, thank you.   I feel that makes owning a beamer even better if it's your weekend car, that way it feels extra special when you get to drive it!   I would recommend it as the driving in this game is pretty abysmal, I can't imagine what it would be like with a keyboard. Also combat is better suited to a controller imo.   Me too, I was more of a Sack Lunch kinda guy.   Shawshank Redemption for me.    For all the hate this car got it sure looks incredibly comfortable. How's the maintenance on this car OP?   It's on the *right* side.   As someone who has very hairy legs, is it worth it?   Any news on whether the UK/AUS release will be censored?   I think Media Hint isn't free anymore. Try using Hola Unblocker.    Hah I was wondering if this was Sydney, I felt the bus kind of gave it away even though it's blurry as hell.   Hahah yeah it does look like a ghetto interface, is it accurate?    OP what is home schooling like? How long do you get taught for per day?   She's actually smiling in this one!   Yeah almost all negative press about the film has been in regards to it's box office performance which is a shame because it's such a fantastic film.    Can that screen still display navigation? If so can it even be updated?   Does Sidwell still work for Tony? I thought he left to start up his own hedgefund.   Can we just talk about how unrealistic it is that Daft Punk would be having a concert.    Fuck me, if this is true that they are planning a trilogy in with Mass Effect style decision based choices then I am beyond stoked for this. DE:HR was one of my favourite games last gen and to see it return like this will blow my mind.    Hahah this where I first heard that scream!   From what I remember he was about to but they crashed and he was knocked out by the airbag, then waking up in the infirmary with another persons blood.    She said she could feel it, she felt that she had lost the power much like Cage said he had felt he lost it as well after the car crash.    I just checked the Ford AU site and it has this quote:  "There's a thrilling 5.0-litre V8 engine option available, but the real news is how we've unleashed Mustang-level performance from Ford's highly efficient 2.3L EcoBoost engine."   Then it again it does say specifications will change closer to date.    So nothing like Batman then.    What kind of material are these made of? They look so weak but seem to do quite a bit of damage to someone.   We won't get the Mustang here in Aus though :(   She explains in the film that she bled out exactly like Cage did and when she woke up she had lost the power. She never said she died and lost it but that she bled out and had her blood replaced.    I think pretty much all these changes are for the best. The film ending can also be up for interpretation, while it isn't as directly sad as the book ending, it can still be sad in it's on way since film Cage may have almost fallen for Rita but due to the reset he realises that she wouldn't remember him nor fall for him.    When they tease the other 2 films at the end it really reminded me of the [teaser for The Matrix Reloaded](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-URQ4sMzBvA).    Splitscreen is very hard to develop into a game. It requires extensive coding and testing plus it would probably add a delay to a game. Personally the amount of people who would be using split screen would be minimal and thus the effort required for the amount of people that would use it is not worth it.    Hahah this is actually hilarious   Fuck I love elephants.    I wonder if the film would have done better in the US if they kept that title. While it may sound like a silly title it is catchy and doesn't sound as generic as edge of tomorrow.    Do you guys think Mel Gibson could make a career comeback? The last film I saw him in was Get The Gringo which, personally I loved. It seems that he really isn't getting any recognition because of some off screen incidents. Personally I would like to see him direct again.    Are you sure you don't mean A.I?   So I saw this for the first time a few weeks ago and I don't really know how to feel about this one. It seems like a fairly dry film but with some seemingly cool ideas and themes. The masked party in particular was very interesting and has that perfect mysterious air about the whole situation, however I just don't know how to feel about the film overall I felt kind of empty after watching it haha. What was the general consensus for this film, it being Stanley Kubricks last film as well.    Yeah I generally do shoot on manual mode and got some decent snaps I just didn't know you used the stock lens to get these shots!   I know that a lot of people didn't like the film but I have a feeling that The Counselor may get a cult following.    Why exactly do they owe Sony an exclusive game?   Well shit I have the exact same camera and lens haha it seems now I know what is capable of my camera.   	112

                Madison County maybe? There is a movie called Pig Mask could be from that, I just surf gifs and post what I like.

 Despite the conflicting nature of these left and right analyses, there is a strong case to be made that they are, in fact, complementary and that they reinforce each other. What if we put it together this way? Automation, foreign competition and outsourcing lead to a decline in well-paying manufacturing jobs, which, in turn, leads to higher levels of unemployment and diminished upward mobility, which then leads to fewer marriages, a rise in the proportion of nonmarital births, increased withdrawal from the labor force, impermanent cohabitation and a consequent increase in dependence on government support. The major roadblock to synthesizing competing explanations has been  and continues to be  political polarization. Vested interests on the left and right have delayed, and in some cases prevented, recognition of the overlap between liberal and conservative hypotheses, and have pointedly ignored evidence that contradicts their preconceived partisan positions.  Most of what you need to know about the causes poverty in America and our inability to reduce it in a few sentences.        True, but's it's so amusing. I particularly enjoy this part.   Ryan professed not to know the price of the wine, and one of his buddies responded to Feinberg's chastisement by loudly saying, "Fuck her," Feinberg told TPM.  Ryan is a guy who complains about the lack of civility in politics and public life.  But when he had an opportunity to correct one of his buddies, appears he didn't step up.   Somehow [Paul Ryan's report on poverty](http://budget.house.gov/waronpoverty/)  never mentions this issue. Now why would that be?     May be?  Is. FTFW   If you want to extend the alliteration, you could add bankers and bumblers.   I see Texas has moved up to [30th](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_U.S._states_by_income#cite_note-1) among the states in per capita income while managing to maintain [46th place](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_U.S._states_by_income#cite_note-1) for it's poverty rate.  Maybe one day Texas will catch up with New Jersey.  which has somehow, with high taxes and without the enormous natural resources Texas has,  managed to have a higher income and a lower poverty rate. Oh  and why have property values held steady in Texas?  Funny thing, a [legal restriction](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/04/03/AR2010040304983.html), played a big role in that.    That's why, no matter what the problem, Republicans insist that government is not the solution; tax cuts for the wealthy are. There's only one hitch: none of this is really true.  But that's no reason not to believe it.      That's a pretty funny simile. I'm gonna steal it and claim it as my own, just like a banker.   What's even more amazing is that we're supposed to take him seriously.     Should we keep bailing out the bankers when [they fail](http://dailybail.com/home/busted-watch-tarp-republican-paul-ryan-begging-congress-to-v.html)? They should keep all their profits when they succeed and be rescued when they fail?  Paul Ryan seems to think so.   Paul Ryan - Putting America's bankers and billionaires first!      Alternately, the GOP could stop talking nonsense.   There might be some other writers at the National Review who are thoughtful on race relations, but I doubt these ideas are widely held among conservatives.  If you put the above quote in front of the voters who selected Mitt Romney, what percentage do you think would agree with it?   The fourth view, closest to my own, is that the problem is fundamentally one of economics and economic history: Having been formally shut out of much of the economy until within recent memory, African Americans simply lag behind the average. The relatively fast economic advancement of other minority groups, such as Vietnamese immigrants, does not negate that premise: The history and position of black Americans is fundamentally different from that of immigrant groups. American institutions expended a great deal of effort to help assimilate and advance Vietnamese refugees, while many of those institutions had spent a solid century after the Civil War working to prevent the assimilation and advancement of African Americans.  I'm rather surprised to see a paragraph like this in the National Review.  I wonder how many of Williamson's fellow conservatives agree with it. Not many, I'd think.   Not to mention the economic system.   Thanks. The best insults are the ones you can back up.   GOP congressional candidate Torrey Westrom is an obvious [moron. ]  (http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2012/09/19/heres-why-the-47-percent-argument-is-an-abuse-of-tax-data/)  Next topic please   I would imagine the conservative country would become a low tax, low public service and low wage economy.  A large percentage of the population would  have few opportunities and no meaningful civil rights, there would be  a relatively small middle class, and with most of the wealth concentrated in a few hands. Sort of like the South until the 1970's.  The liberal side likely evolve into a society more like Canada or Northern European states.   In international affairs, I would expect the conservative nation to be isolationist or belligerent and xenophobic, or more likely alternate between the two.     Stravinsky's Rite of Spring, played live with a full orchestra.   I wouldn't want to give up my car, but I'd gladly give up my daily commute if their were a reliable and reasonably quick public transportation alternative. I would cut my driving by more than half.   I had a friend whose mother-in-law was in an assisted living facility with dementia. My friend told me 'One day when I was visiting I looked around and noticed that almost everybody who works there smoked, the nurses, even some of the doctors who came in.  I think they saw the end game and decided they aren't staying around for it.'   Once I was driving and heard Ole '55 on the radio and thought to myself, 'Maybe I've misjudged the Eagles all these years. I never knew they could write a song like this.'   Turns out they can't.    I'm not impressed. I inherited nothing, so if you consider the ratio of wealth created to inheritance received, I've done much better than the Koch's.   Deut. 15:7. If there is a poor man among you, one of your brothers, in any of the towns of the land which the LORD your God is giving you, you shall not harden your heart, nor close your hand to your poor brother; but you shall freely open your hand to him, and generously lend him sufficient for his need in whatever he lacks.  Good idea, and I hope all his Republican colleagues read this verse.     Best comment in the thread.  I'd rather buy from a local 'natural' or 'no spray ' farmer than industrial organic everytime.  Local produce also tastes better because the farm to table time is much shorter than organic food from Chile or Mexico   Unless we have a collapse in the financial  industries similar to the auto industry, no. Though New York does have one hell of underfunded pension problem.   AND plutocracy, let's not forget plutocracy.   As John Stuart Mill, the British political economist, argued, people should be free to do as they please, provided they dont cause undue harm to others. But greenhouse gases have already caused great harm and threaten much worse. Mills cost-benefit framework provides no reason for thinking that someones freedom to escape the small burden of CO2 taxation should trump other, vastly more important freedoms. To the contrary, he said, restrictions on individual liberty are needed when the health and safety of the great mass of people and the purity of the natural environment are at stake.  It makes good economic sense to be a climate change denier if you're a heavy CO2 user or producer. If you argue that the problem doesn't exist, you can't be harming anyone else, and you don't need to pay to clean up your messes.   Correct.  Our Northern European pale skins are going to be a maladaptive characteristic soon.    What books are impossible to keep in stock?  I knew a used bookstore owner  who told me he was tempted to put up a sign that read. 'No, we don't have any Bukowski or Henry Miller.'.   Walker wants Wisconsin to become a low tax, low wage, high profit state.  Sort of like a North South Carolina.   Unfortunately, the availability of guns is used by the police as an [excuse for further militarization] (http://rt.com/usa/164816-american-police-militarization-war/).  I doubt that Franklin, Indiana is actually a war zone that requires armored vehicles.   [There's plenty of Republicans who have suggested Obama's impeachment.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efforts_to_impeach_Barack_Obama) Too bad if they don't like the what they started.   I don't know why he apologized.  Seems like a rather generous estimate of Fox Nation News.      Calling Rush Limbaugh as asshole would be underestimating him.   Looks like the Republicans have her replacement lined up. [The most frightening candidate Ive met in seven years interviewing congressional hopefuls](http://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2014/07/30/the-most-frightening-candidate-ive-met-in-seven-years-interviewing-congressional-hopefuls/)   I'm with you.  I see EBT cards used to buy crap junk food much more often than I see them used for luxury foodstuffs.    I think the consensus opinion on the stimulus and jobs is more like [this](http://money.cnn.com/2011/09/08/news/economy/stimulus_jobs_record/).   Did anyone else notice that Ryan's report on poverty fails to mention that wages for low income American's have fallen dramatically over the last few decades?  The single biggest cause of poverty is essentially ignored. Honestly, you'd need an entire team of Clydesdales to come up with this much horseshit.   1) Renewables are more expensive now, but we've really only started to put research and money into them.  I remember a time when cell phones were much more expensive than land lines and had very limited coverage.  The relative cost of technologies can change rapidly. 2) Natural gas would be a good bridge if we're serious about reducing the methane leaks when extracting it.  Otherwise methane is serious contributor to warming as well.    It's not just Republican governors who you should be worried about.  There's plenty of manipulating government grants for political purposes at the local level. Do you think the Chicago Democrats would keep their hands clean when there's a big pile of block grant money in front of them? Corruption doesn't really track party lines.   Take a look at the [proposal](http://budget.house.gov/uploadedfiles/expanding_opportunity_in_america.pdf).  .  Do you see any discussion about the change in [ income distribution] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Household_income_in_the_United_States )   in the United States over the last 50 years? I can't. The biggest driver of poverty in the United States is an economic system that is concentrating wealth at the top.  Anyone who discusses poverty in the US and leaves this out is not interested in having an honest discussion.   Fair enough, but then the utilities need say that.  Structure a base rate with a minimum number of kilowatt hours included, and charge that amount for the monthly connection.  They could then structure rebates and further charges against that amount.   A homeless guy once asked me for a dollar to help make his BMW payment. I gave it to him.   We all want to look older than we are until we want to look younger.  There's about 5 minutes in between when age and appearance are in the right balance.   Atlantis.    I wasn't commenting on the on the proposal, but on Ryan's veracity. It seems to me that people who I've found to be dishonest tend to stay dishonest (and I don't care if you're talking about finance , romance or politics), and you should look at any proposal from such people skeptically. Perhaps you've had better experiences with reformed prevaricators than I have.    But turning to the proposal itself, I'm surprised by how much there is to like in it. Lower incarceration rates and increasing the EIC for childless adults, if it were any Republican but Paul Ryan suggesting this, he'd be getting jumped on for having become a squishy moderate.  There are also a number of dubious ideas, such as replacing programs with block grants to local governments.  I would imagine that places like Minnesota and Nebraska we'd see well run programs with impartial administrators, and in places like Chicago and Louisiana you'll see the grants abused for political favoritism, if not actually stolen.  There's also one genuinely laughable idea, life coaches.  We've had 'life coaches' for the poor since Jane Adams' Hull House, except for they're called social workers.  Relabeling them life coaches isn't going to make it any easier to transform people's lives. But here's the real problem with Ryan's plan.  Do you see any discussion about the change in [ income distribution](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Household_income_in_the_United_States )   in the United States over the last 50 years?  In fact, hit crtl-F, type in distribution and see how many times and where the word turns up.    How can you claim to be discussing 'Opportunity in America' and how government programs have failed  to end poverty and ignore the fact that the income of the lowest quintile has fallen so greatly compared to everyone else?  Perhaps the problem isn't really the personal pathologies among the poor, or the ineffectiveness of government programs, but a increasingly unfair economic system.  I suspect that Ryan doesn't want that discussion started, so he's hiding the ball here. Its just his latest in his long line of distortions ,dissemblings and dishonesties.    Ryan does have a habit of telling ["stretchers"](http://www.cbsnews.com/news/fact-checking-6-claims-in-paul-ryans-convention-speech/6/).    I think that's a good move. US has been giving away its resources as ludicrously low prices for centuries.  If we're having an oil and gas boom without selling government resources, why put them on the market now?  And I would think our free market friends don't want the government competing with private industry to sell mineral rights.   Oil companies are upset that Obama isn't leasing Federal Lands at give away rates.   Another successful minority outreach by your Republican Party!   Well. since they're far from the coast, I guess they think the sea level rise and flooding won't reach them ,,, Although if I were in the coal industry, I think I'd want to support politicians who were working on new cleaner technologies.  Carbon capture would be the best chance for the coal industry to stay viable.   Great idea.  Also any business receiving a government subsidy or tax break  should receive a 'profit coach' and present a plan for getting of the government teat.   I always like to ask conservatives if they can tell me of some more contemporary examples of Republican politicians doing something for blacks.  The smart ones know about Eisenhower and civil rights, and then they kind of run out of material ....    House Budget Chair Paul Ryans "new" plan picks on poor children and families while not asking for one cent of sacrifice from rich corporations and rich individuals  If Paul Ryan was running an honest campaign, his slogan would be "He'll never ask the billionaires or bankers to sacrifice."    Excellent comment.  You should send it to [Amar Kaleka](http://www.votekaleka.org/).    But where Ryan and others get it wrong is in their pervasive assumption that all you have to do to get a job is want a job. In this regard, here is what you need to know about work requirements: in the absence of strong labor demand, such requirements are a recipe for more, not less, poverty.  Why is it so hard to understand?  Do conservatives think the unemployment rate went from 4.7% in January 2006 to 9.7% in January 2011 because Americans became lazier and less willing to work over those 5 years?      Maybe it's my ethnic pride, but I think Irish Catholics are the true masters of internalized guilt. Jews talk a good game, and don't overlook the Lutherans, but for that soul-crushing, immobilizing guilt, nothing beat being Irish Catholic.    How about this for an anti-poverty program?   An economic system that benefits everyone, not just a small fraction on the top.    Greatest insult?  No it's just everyday, immature rudeness.   Those Publicans always mess it up.    Somebody's got to fill the void left by Michelle Bachmann's departure.   Recycling and repurposing at its best.   I'm a straight white man and I don't understand how straight white men can vote Republican.     Myself, I think the album would have improved if they'd left off Maxwell's Silver Hammer.   Americans hate it when they think someone is getting a free ride, which is why attacks on welfare recipients are so effective.  If the Democrats would show that the 1% are not earning what they're getting, they'd put the Republicans on the defensive.  But only Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders seem to have the cojones for the fight.    The best predictions for the 2012 election were not done by Nate Silver, but from Sam Wang at [Princeton Election Consortium](http://election.princeton.edu/ ). He predicted Obama's win earlier that just about anyone else, missed only Florida in the electoral college, and called all the Senate seats correctly.  At the moment, his prediction on the Senate is "Bottom line, Democrats have a 55% chance of control in an election held today. That is as close to a toss-up as it gets. "   So were these increases in homicides made up entirely of justified homicides allowed under the new laws? Both studies were inconclusive, but the authors seemed doubtful. The Georgia State study noted that substituting assailants for innocents didn't account for the increase. The Texas A M analysis concluded it was "unlikely, albeit not impossible."       Its puerilty has finally crossed over into indecency. Its triviality has finally crossed over into obscenity. The comical political starfcking that is its primary raison d'erp has finally crossed over into $10 meth-whoring on the Singapore docks. Once a mere surface irritation, Tiger Beat On The Potomac has finally crossed over into being a thickly pustulating chancre on the craft of journalism. It has demonstrated its essential worthlessness. It has demonstrated that it has the moral character of a sea-slug and the professional conscience of the Treponema pallidum spirochete. Trust me. Stephen Glass never sunk this low. Mike (Payola) Allen has accomplished the impossible. He's made Jayson Blair look like Ernie Pyle.  That, Ladies and Gentlemen is an insult for the ages. And he maintains the pace for the entire article.      What's he worried about? It'll be fabulous!      I read Vonnegut as a teenager and young adult, and then ignored him for years afterward, thinking he was an entertaining writer, but kind of an intellectual lightweight.  But as I've gotten older , I've come to the opinion he may not have been the most subtle or original thinker America produced, but damn, he was often right on the money.  You needn't be a complex writer and thinker to be a good one.   While there are some well written and reasoned counterarguments to Krugman, but articles with titles like [Paul Krugman Is Dumber Than We Thought](http://www.forbes.com/sites/richkarlgaard/2014/07/11/paul-krugmans-is-dumber-than-we-thought/) are far more common.      Krugman is being demonized by the right wing press because they don't have answers for his arguments. And if you can't win the argument, you attack the person making it.    And Ryan's a smarmy liar too!  They should really be better friends.   I'm always amused that these clowns need to go back 50+ years to find examples of Republicans fighting racism.  Why they don't cite so more contemporary civil rights advocates, like say Jesse Helms?   While 99.9% are fighting for scraps, the .1% is making a big play.  If the Tea Party and OWS types ever figure out they're getting screwed by the same people, we'll start seeing some changes.   Here's another topic NRO may want to explore  Black Americans: the true casualties of racism.

Excellent point. What the economy needs now is consumers with money in their pockets, not more capital.  But since it doesn't fit the conservative dogma, ain't gonna happen.   Sure seems so.  I can't think of a single piece of economic legislation pushed by Republicans that doesn't benefit the wealthy disproportionately.    [The University of Chicago Crime Lab](https://crimelab.uchicago.edu/page/guns) has been studying gun violence for a long time.

The Republican majority in the House is due to geography and redistricting, not a majority of conservatives.   The difference would be that while Bush only gave lip service to bipartisanship, Obama made a genuine effort.  Seems like Obama was about the last person in the country to realize he was wasting his time.   Best chance we have for a Democratic Senator from Mississippi.  Go for it Chris!  Show everyone that the Tea Party can screw things up even after losing a primary.   The obvious counterargument to trickle down economics is that Customers with money create jobs.  I don't understand why liberals have never pushed this.   Perhaps, but I think the tag of 'Red State Socialist' might make it harder for southern and Western conservatives to pretend their states aren't dependent on government spending, and make it more difficult for them toss off the word 'socialist' every time someone suggests an improvement to social welfare programs or reasonable regulation.    Red State Socialism is an excellent phrase.  It identifies the hypocrites readily and tags them with a label they'll hate.  Hope it catches on.  Edit: removed extra word.   And the uniforms!!!

We had a media day where all of the ships got in a large circle, all facing inwards. The goal was to take a picture of all the ships together, and right in the middle of everything they were going to blow up a mine. As all of the ships had just finished getting into position, a sandstorm came out of nowhere and just swallowed up everything around us. We couldn't see the ship next to us, which was only a few hundred yards away.

If i get the Y50, the upper model already has an SSD (only 512GB but should be enough storage). The GTX860M is about 30% better on average framerate than the GTX850M. So basically, which would you go for? i love the red look of the Y50, but it is more pricey (i would get a discount of prolly a few hundred of the ASUS). Is it worth the extra?  	5
 When discussing his favorite films since he started directing, he said The Matrix was his favorite before he saw the sequels which 'ruined the mythology' for him.  I consider the sequels strangely sub-par films compared to the original but am curious what specifically do you think he meant by them ruining the mythology.   I'm looking for specific examples/themes/etc pertaining to the mythology set up by the first film.  Thanks!   Edit: Grammar/clarification.   Bonus Edit:  Here's the [video of Tarantino talking about his favorite films since he started directed](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zv0WlHbBhdc).  He talks about the Matrix around 3:00.

[Better angle](http://i.imgur.com/LfWFuRt.jpg)  ..Though obviously, the bone in this frame doesn't 'touch' the device.  The misaligned angle bone, so to speak, DOES 'touch' the device in the frame.  Perhaps this is one of the reasons it is used.   Also, notice the vertical antenna (or whatever it is) on the device just after the cut.  Curiously, it's slightly misaligned with its base.  In the next frame (and beyond), it's attached.  Here is the second frame after the cut..  [Second frame after cut](http://i.imgur.com/6iFjGxd.jpg)  ..Maybe a transfer issue with the DVD?  Unnoticed special effects flaw sort of like the helicopter blade shadows in The Shining?   As you can see, when you slow down the scene and/or watch it frame-by-frame, you can see the angles do not line up, which could have easily been done with a few less frames.  Since Kubrick was a known perfectionist and quite in control of every aspect of his films, it would seem he purposely ensured they were not lined up. (Perhaps to symbolize the road of technology was imperfect?)  What are your thoughts?

She's continuing with therapy.  After talking with me over several weeks, we've concluded that it's best if she is not intimate with men (for the foreseeable future).  She's always been bisexual, but becomes very anxious when thinking about intercourse with a man now, but says she still wants to be with me.  She thinks she can overcome the feelings she has when she's intimate with me, since she loves me.  Over time, I was able to convince her to move on.  She's been with women before, but hadn't really been consensually intimate with a man besides myself.  Her studies are improving now, and she's getting healthier.  We'll be fine.  	18
 Well, I'm not bald, but my husband is.    When I was 20 weeks pregnant, we got one of those 3-D ultrasound photos of our unborn daughter.  She already very clearly had my husband's nose.  When I would show it to people, I would say proudly "She already looks just like her daddy," and more than one person, totally serious mind you, would say "Oh, because she's bald?"  Guys.  Come on.  He shaves his head.  It's not a genetic trait.  She came out with a Mohawk, incase you were curious.    I collect a certain set of Christmas tree ornaments.  I also keep track of a bunch of silly little details on them (release year, amount paid, place procured, release number, etc) in an Excel spreadsheet.  I mentioned this spreadsheet in a job interview.  Obviously I was just about laughed out of the room, but they still offered me the job.  Even at six months pregnant.   That Tiefling they make you party with in Neverwinter Nights 2.  I can't remember her stupid name.     A lot of court issued documents are public property and some states have begun putting them on the internet.  If you know someone's name and date of birth, you can find things that can potentially lead you to other things.  I had the most luck with tracking down things like divorce papers and death certificates to give me locations that I then used to check archived obituaries for.  Obits list survivors.  You can look up these survivors' phone number and get leads.    Aww, thank you Sunshiny Cloud!  I'm glad things got better for you!  You're a very kind person, your kids are lucky to have you. :)     "it will take about two years to get back on track"  I'm so grateful to you I have tears in my eyes.  Thank you so much.  Really.  Thank you.    No, not yet.  My OB decided to do a pap at my two month post-natal appointment, so my insurance doesn't cover another well-woman until 2016.  I didn't even think about it at the time!  Do you think it's serious enough that I should just pony up out of pocket?  (I've got high deductible insurance.) Thank you for the response. :)   Hello,  My daughter is now seven months old, but I'm still dealing with a lot of the physical symptoms from my pregnancy. The most annoying one is the carpal tunnel. I've lost all my baby weight, why are my arms and hands still hurting? Will they never go back to normal?   I'm also struggling with "baby-brain" before I would make mistakes like having to say "wanting to help because we're all people" instead of "compassion," which makes sense, but these days, I go to type "beautiful" and end up typing "people!" What gives?!  I've also still go a lot of pain down there. I gave birth naturally and it took them an hour to stitch me back up. I've healed, obviously, but the scar tissue hurts during intercourse... will it ever go away?  This is TMI (like most of the things in this post, sorry!) but what about hemorrhoids? I'm never constipated, but they just won't go away.  Ladies, does it get better or do we just sort of forget what it was like before and move on?  Thank you for your time and responses. :)     http://static2.stuff.co.nz/1367997005/733/8648733.jpg I got you a link!    It's Georgie!  I'm a girl. Ahahaha.    To be 100% honest, it's not their concern.  If they were a better fit, they would be doing it.  If they're just criticizing with no aspirations, then the manager should consider it to be noise so long as they accept that valid points may be made that contribute to personal or professional betterment.  But the truth is that a lot of times subordinates are just bored and looking for things to get upset with.  If someone has a legitimate concern, to reiterate what I said, they need to bring it to their manager.  If the manager fails to act, go above them.  It's on that next tier to decide who is qualified and who is not.    Maybe I clicked through your username.... maybe I did.  It's okay, though, all I did was upvote some of your more inane comments.  I consent to a similar stalking act if you feel so inclined. ;)  Sorry that board harshed your mellow, man.    Did you die tho?  Just kidding.  I'm loving your contributions.  The Double Double one made me spit out my soda at my desk. XD   Two Times:  1) You've been very explicit about your issues, but they are blowing you off.  2) It's an issue of a sensitive subject (e.g. sexual in nature) that involves them.    Lost in Translation.  Pretty much every scene he filmed for the whiskey commercial was priceless.  When he acted in slow motion, his goofy impression of Roger Moore, all of it.  So silly.     Let me start by saying that you're doing a great job.  These first few weeks are one of the strangest times of your life and you're expected to handle them on little or no sleep with a broken and recovering body.  You're so strong and you're doing such a good job.  Now let's talk about this sleep thing.  You have some valid complaints here, but you seem like a very practical and reasonable person who knows that some times you just have to let things slide.  I want you to examine why you're upset when you get upset.  Do you feel that a specific remark is insinuating that you're not working hard enough?  That you're not competent in his eyes?  It's good to understand why we feel what we feel because understanding allows us the chance to recognize when we are overreacting or being unreasonable.  This has nothing to do with you, personally, it's just human nature!  The thing is that a lack of sleep make a mountain out of a molehill.  We're more irritable and we don't feel well, that makes things seem worse.  I love that you said you don't get frustrated with your baby, but the truth is that frustration is normal, you might be putting it somewhere else, wrong or right.  Don't feel bad about it, just think about it.  Now the most important thing here is to communicate.  If he is making you feel like he thinks you are a bad mother, you should say so in a way that is matter-of-fact and as unemotional as possible.  A lot of times people just don't realize that what they're saying is hurting us.  I want you to think about something.  How often in your life have you said something with the specific intention of hurting another person?  Probably never, right?  Other people are usually no different.  If he is hurting you, he's probably not doing it intentionally, but he still needs to know how he's making you feel.   His overreaction to the baby's perceived health problems is borne out of love, I think you know that because you are very observant.  If he's that enamored of your little man, you might just be able to convince him to go show him off.  My area hospital has pre-natal classes that are just for fathers.  These classes pair up with the new-father support group and their babies.  Daddy might just need some time with other guys who are going through the same thing, validate those feelings, and then relax.  I know we want to be all things for our partners, but sometimes we relate best to members of our own sex, you know?  This little stuff you're talking about that bothers you, it's time to employ pragmatism.  If he is questioning how you are doing something, in a nice, calm, non-emotional way, explain exactly why you are doing it.  If he suggests a different way, ask him to explain (nicely, don't confront) why he thinks that way is the best, to explain it.  If he is a man with a plan or someone who likes to know how things work, this might just short-circuit a heated situation.    I'm sorry that you're having trouble and feeling lousy, but I'm SO PROUD of you for asking for help.  Not only just asking, but you clearly want to do what is best.  You're going to be a wonderful, wonderful example to your little person.  You're rational, caring, have a good perspective, question things that should be questioned, and most of all, you want the very best for everyone involved.  When you come from that place, you're the very best kind of caretaker.        Wow, now you're swearing at me.  I've been nothing but civil to you.  I apologize in advance for how angry this is probably going to make you, because it is never my intention to make someone feel bad, but I am choosing not to give a moment more of my energy.  Take care.     1) I was going to reassure you that attire is a lot less strict these days, but man, if it's Baptist and a small town in Texas, you should probably ask someone you know for clothes to borrow or buy something. It's a lot more normal than you might think to borrow funeral attire.  Lots of people don't have anything to wear to a funeral.  2) There are two parts that happen when a person passes away.  The visitation and the actual funeral.  The visitation is the viewing of the body.  It's usually in the funeral home itself, although in old fashioned places, it can be at a family home.  There are usually prayers recited to the group and then people go up and talk about the deceased.  It's a low pressure deal.  The funeral itself is where you go to the grave site and bury the person if that is what's happening.  Typically a man of the church will be there to say a prayer, but, again, it's not a high pressure thing you participate in.  You just stand there with your head down.  3) Totally not tacky.  I'm sure your family would love to see them.  I'd add a nostalgic little blurb about what a good memory it was if you're so inclined.    I'm glad I could help.  Thank you for thanking me!  It made me feel accomplished. :)   What I did was to put Former before their job title and company, so the reviewer would understand the connection.  If they want to know about current situation, they can ask when they call.  I formatted my line items like this:  *First Name Last Name* / Former *job title here* - *former company name* / Relationship to me (e.g. Past Direct Supervisor) / *Phone number with area code*   I simply don't like exercises in futility. I have rationale, but why do you deserve to know what it is?  I don't owe you an explanation.  I know in my heart that I don't believe a single thing you've accused me of thinking about men.  You can't convince me that I do.  I likely can't convince you that I don't.  So what's the point?  I kind of doubt that you have one.   As an aside, if you really want my attention, you don't have to be a bully to get it.      As a companion to my response to your other question, I'd still rather be short.  I can get into spaces most people can't, I'm more resourceful, I occasionally get out of doing things I don't really want to do, I look adorable at my height, while at 5'3" I would probably be nothing remarkable.    And I would totally date a boy who was short.  I happen to be married to someone who is 6'1.5" but let me tell you, it's pretty much just awkward in every way.  Our wedding pictures are hilarious.  My biggest (ho ho) crushes are right around 5'5".   Edit: Although thinking about it further, I'm pretty devil may care... being 6'2" as a woman would be pretty cool insofar as it fits my personality.  I think if I were very tall, I'd be braver.  I'd still date shorter men though.  Long hair, don't care.     I'm not quite five feet tall.   People take this as a license to rest their forearms on my shoulder as a joke.  They say things like "How's the weather down there?" which they think is funny and original but is not.  They ask me stupid things like if I'm turned away at amusement parks (no, dumbass, I'm not 4'5") and how I put pillowcases on pillows.    The night I got married, I went out for supper with my husband, his step sister, and her husband.  I was 24, the hostess was 19 at the very most.  She said "So three adults and one child?"  Another time, while I was visibly pregnant, and 27, I went out to dinner with the CEO of my then company to a place called "Shula's."  Like Don Shula.  They brought me a menu that was printed on a regulation sized football.  My boss got a paper menu.  Yes, at six months pregnant, they STILL thought I needed a kids menu.  I am almost 30.  I have crows feet.  Are you even paying attention!?     What would be an acceptable answer to you?   I recalibrated the counterweight and set it according to your directive about the anti-skate matching the counterweight setting. I'm still having the same trouble. It is very intermittent. Like the same distance into multiple records, but not a constant issue, track three is bad, track five is terrible, track four sounds fine.... I might just need to bring it in for repairs. I'm out of my depth.    I'm not actually certain that the counterweight is right... it was already installed on my unit.  I'll try taking it off and putting it back on according to the instructions to be sure.  Thank you for the help.  I would have assumed that the settings on it were accurate rather than that the part might be on wrong so the settings mean nothing.    Can you give us any more background?  Is his mother in pain?  Is he not getting enough to eat?  Is he not interested?  Is he detaching?  What exactly seems to be the trouble here?    I'm not sure if you're actually asking me or just making a point, but to err on the side of optimism, no, it told me to set the counterweight at 2.    I've looked up anti-skate and what I'm getting is that everyone has an opinion on it and I probably need some sort of test record to set it?   What exactly are you looking for here?    What is anti-skate?  Like I know where the setting is, but what does it do?  What should I be listening for it to change?  I have a 0 - 3 for that one.  My manual doesn't explain what it does, it just tells me to set it at 0.    How often do you ever say anything with the explicit intention of hurting someone's feelings?  I bet it's almost never if not never period.  The truth is that even the most hurtful people we have to deal with on a daily basis rarely intend to hurt us, they're just not cognizant of how they really come across.  If you feel attacked, take a moment to think if there is any possible positive place that the comment could come from.  If you can't think of any, just say in a curious, open kind of voice "I'm not sure what you mean, can you elaborate?"  If they really are being an asshole, at that point they'll get all red and sputtery and you'll come out on top.  I doubt that scenario will play out, though.  People are seriously about 10x more harmless than we can ever imagine.    I went ahead and did it three separate times just in case I was accidentally twisting it somehow... it's still too slow.  Could it be the pressure setting?    No, it's definitely the player.... My brand new Neil Young album played fine on my last set-up and it's all distorted and slow on this one, just the same as the other record, which was also brand new. :-/   The third track is too slow, I'm sorry, I should have specified.  I haven't tried a different record... I'll go do that now and report directly back!    Hello, thanks for the fast response!  I just went in and tried it and it is the same.   Hello /r/vinyl ; I got my second-hand Teac TN-300 in the mail today.  I don't have any experience with turntables, but I think the belt needs to be replaced on this one.  The first track on the record sounds fine, but when I get to the second it's intermittently the wrong speed, and the third is unlistenable... I've tried Google and looking through the Amazon reviews and the Teac website but I can't find any information on replacement parts....  Can someone tell me what kind of belt and stylus I should get for this turntable?    I apologize in advance if these are ridiculous questions. I'm really lost!   Here you go, friend: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice#Ice_harvesting :)   While I think responding to you will probably only encourage this type of behavior, I'll take the time to point out that it was by merit of my action, a forward suggestion to contact a stranger about personal issues, that prompted my comment.  It was meant as a reassurance.  It wasn't meant as a condemnation of men in general, but a recommendation on why I might be able to help.  I'm very sorry that you took offense to my remark to the point that you needed to go to the trouble of making an account just to catch me out, but you only need go through my comment history to see that I'm interested in helping other human beings.  I'm not a man-hater.  Hopefully this susses things and you move along back to your main account.    I'm actually really flattered someone cares so much about me that they made an account just to send me weird replies from though.... Oh reddit, you magical place, you. :)    I'm not sure why this is a reply to me, man. I don't believe that at all!    It's nice man!  I like the leaves and the yard too!  And the color of your t-shirt is a great color with everything else.  Nice picture. :)   This is interesting to me.  My husband once told me that he never suggests any solutions to my problems because he simply assumes that anything he could come up with would be something I already thought of myself.  He's rather missing the point (which I've told him)... it's the act of making an effort that matters, not the outcome.  It's the same with this, the act of trusting someone enough to tell them what you really feel.  From your response, you're either someone with anxiety (like me) or you're with someone who isn't good to you.  In either case, I'm sorry that things aren't easier for you, and I hope they get better some day.    I think that it is infinitely more responsible than protesting abortion by carrying giant photos of aborted fetuses in public where children can see them and be scarred for life.  Too much?  I'm big on freedom of speech.  I'm big on my country.  I'm also big on personal responsibility.  Yes, I understand that it is your right to protest with photos of gore.  But should you?  Does it not contradict your whole position?    I LOVE America.  I'm SO PROUD to be an American.  Really.  While I will be the first one up and I will sing every damn word of the Star Spangled Banner, I will not recite the pledge of allegiance.  I find worship of an inanimate object to be fascist.  And I love that because I am an American, I can talk about this with you all.  I am only too aware that my freedom has come at a cost, and so not exercising those freedoms is a crime.  Since I'm on the soapbox, vote folks.  It's important.      PM me if you ever want to talk.  I promise I'm not a creepy old man.  Just a girl who is close to 30 and knows what it is like to be in a problematic marriage.    I'm sorry. :(   Okay, I think I've been waiting for almost 15 years to see someone ask about this so I can say:  All or Nothing.  I have seen All or Nothing.  It has no plot, you can't understand a single thing they're saying without the captions, it's depressing, and confusing.  But sometimes I see the preview again, and it is literally such a good trailer that I think to myself... Maybe I just didn't get it the first go round.  Maybe I should see it again.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qz6RreTMEyA   I have a friend who lives half the way down the world from me.    He refuses to believe that we have "not for profit" banks here (meaning a credit union).  He also refuses to believe anything about the phenomenon of Ice Harvesting.   I've proven both things, but as he says "I believe it, but it's bullshit."   I don't think it has anything to do with luck, except in the way one might say our souls are placed into specific bodies, but I actually don't believe in souls.    I think childbirth is one of those things that hasn't really been researched in the way it should be.  For example, while doctors know what to give you to induce labor, they actually have no idea what it is in our bodies that sends us into it.  Why don't they know this yet?   Virtual Reality by RedRover... or anything by RedRover really.... but this one is about LadyDevimon tricking the girls from 02 Digimon into entering a virtual reality with their Digimon and forcing them into about ten odd combinations of sexual assault on her and each other.      Stop.  Are you being serious?!  Edit: I actually don't want to know.   Stuffed bell peppers are too much of a pain in the ass to make unless you're making a ton of them... I'd do that!  And I'd freeze the extras. :)   I've got a new theme song for you : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8AhKO4NXJA4  Apparently it is not so weird of a phenom that it prevented Ryan Adams from singing about it on what is arguably one of the best country albums ever written.    Mac, c'mon, man.  What's that first word in my reply?   Typically in America no "whole food" is taxed, meaning ingredients such as vegetables or oatmeal or meat.  It's only prepared and processed things that are non-essential that are taxed, like soda, chips, and fast food.   I like to use it in conjunction with holiday weekends.  For instance in America, Christmas is on a Friday and New Years is the following Friday.  I'd take off M-R of New years week for sure... and I'd ask for it now.  You get ten days for the price of four!     Oh no, you misunderstood my question, but also gave me the answer.  I mean there, because you said Tampons were, pads were not, so what are cups?  Thanks for the info, this is useless trivia I'm sure I can entertain someone with.  :)   Seriously though, can you let me know if the Diva Cup is taxed?  Now I'm actually curious.    Listen, you can't hold back your diva power when you are a stripper.... so you use le Diva Cup.  This is 101 stuff.  Cancel the revolt!  Mort le Revolution!    Any question whatsoever I might post in /r/vinyl   Talk about an intimidating group.    Here in America, prepared food is taxed (le Cheeseburger) but grocery items (le broccoli) are not.  Tampons are the fast food of feminine products.  Off-the-cuff-theory-Thursday! Hey!    Snowtown   I'm sorry you've upset yourself so much by thinking about this... it's pretty simple, so don't worry further: It's a human survival trait to recommend ourselves to others by mimicking their facial expressions.  They see us smile, they become conscious of their ability to manipulate their facial muscles (you can stick your tongue out and raise your eyebrows at a newborn, and they will mimic you, but it is subconscious), and then they smile to recommend themselves to you.  Smiling feels good because it releases endorphins.  So they keep doing it. :)   Kismet.  You stop that.  I'm looking at you, alternative rock band HURT.    My OLD apartment.  Funny thing.  The lightbulbs kept burning out there.... So we moved.    Yes, your first sentence is exactly what I'm saying.   Team Dakota Regular 4ever.  (Yes, I'm trolling, but in a fond sort of way that I hope is endearing rather than enraging.)   Because if you use your caps lock and italicize it, it looks like the distinctive handwritten font used in 1960's era comics.  We need this for our satire.    I feel very flattered by this and some what self conscious since I'm laughing alone in my office like a crazy person.     Honey, the very worst thing that can happen to you is that you say the words "You know what?  That's a great question.  I'm not sure about that, but I would like to ask my supervisor.  Would you mind holding?"  I've been on every level of a call center from agent to business development.  It really is that simple.   Your anxiety is totally normal for anyone that is starting a new job.  You will learn, and because you're so concerned about doing a good job, you will probably become a shining example faster than you think.  Good luck!  I believe in you!    If I weren't married, we'd be getting married.  To each other.    This is actually pretty simple: Beer tastes good.  Good gin also tastes good.  People don't necessarily drink to get drunk.   It is an easy thing to feel happy in an altered state.  The hard thing is to be happy when you're just yourself.  To be able to deal with things that are uncomfortable or boring or upsetting without reaching for some crutch.   Thank you for telling me how you feel.  I will endeavor to use more descriptors if you ever ask me how I am and it is my impulse to say "fine." 3   Okay, now I have to confess the one passive aggressive thing I did that I'm, like, super proud of, indulge me, okay?:   My old apartment had a HUGE window on one wall. The neighbor would leave the porch light on all night, so I couldn't sleep well as it was bright, and my dogs would bark at things moving in the driveway. I asked my husband to turn it off after an hour, but he didn't want to offend the neighbor. One day when the light had been on all night and all of that day, I went out with a broom and very lightly tapped the lightbulb, breaking the filament in it, so it appeared to have burned out from being on all the time. The damn thing was nine feet up, so it wasn't like they were going to change it. Ahahaha!    I hate to break it to you, but some of us women (like me) operate in a typical male fashion where we just say what we mean when we feel like it.  And some men are insufferably passive aggressive.  We're rarely matched with two of the same kind. ;)  If I tell you I'm fine, I actually mean I'm in a neutral place between "really great" and "not so great."  I'm telling you the truth.     I have inane stories for all occasions, but here is one to humor you:  My mother planted a weeping maple in our yard.  As the name suggests, the leaves hang downward on it like it is weeping.  About four months passed with this tree in our yard, and my sister came in and said, 100% serious mind you, "Mom, I think your tree is sick."  I have about 10 more stories like this between my two sisters.    Giving birth.  They tell you the first time it'll be 20+ hours of labor and more painful than you can imagine and that you'll probably end up needing medical intervention at some point.  I was in labor for 11 hours, pushed for 45 minutes, no drugs.  They did spend an hour stitching me back up, but I was pretty much in shock at that point, so all I remember is how I wanted to put my legs down, so what is taking so long.  All in all, I was thinking it would be MUCH WORSE.    Do Canadians have birth certificates?  In America, we have our fathers' names on them, linking their government identifier to ours.  Also in America, we sometimes have to bring in a birth certificate as proof of our citizenship with other things.  This might be a way to get your hands on it...   My situation isn't exactly like yours, but my father was never a part of my life, and then when I was 12, we got word that he had passed away.  When I was 21, I managed to get ahold of his ashes without having met or interacted with anyone on that side of the family myself.  I had his name and I dug into old obituaries.  The obits list survivors which gave me leads that led to other leads on who to find contact information for.   Good luck!    "A personal point of pride for me is my discipline.  I am organized and manage my time well.  While I work well in a team, independently I can be counted upon to hold myself to a standard of excellence.  I know that I would be an asset to your company, and you only need speak with me in person to see how passionate I am."    Talk about their feelings.  Like I get that you don't tend to feel things about petty issues, but my goodness, you must feel some things some times.... why are you just waiting for me to be able to intuit what you're thinking?  It drives me crazy that there are probably things I need to work on but because we never talk about what annoys you or what hurts you, I'll never be able to examine and grow into a better partner.     I'm not sure... but there is actually a whole section on the Argentina Wikipedia page about whether Arggies are actually white.  It's very weird.    This was a lyrical miracle.    I am younger.  And about a foot shorter.  I mean, I'm pretty smart, but how would she know that?  It may be because I am the direct report of the CEO who is also her immediate supervisor, but c'mon... I'm just a secretary!  I'm hardly relevant!    I don't know how much of this is a pretty girl problem, since I suspect it is just a short, young girl problem, but when I worked at Gamestop, I would specifically ask guys if they had any questions, they would tell me no, and then immediately make a bee-line to my male co-workers and proceed to ask them things.    More to the point of what you're talking about here, at my current job, I've incurred a bit of pointless one-sided rivalry with one of the top level ladies.  We're decently close in age.  She was asking co-workers I went to high school with ten years ago what they remembered about me.  She never allows me to do the simple things my predecessor did for her.  She refuses to make eye contact.  She also criticizes my snack choices at board meetings to her co-workers.  I have no idea why she cares about me.  She's got three degrees, I'm in a no-ladder position, and I'm pretty nice/helpful/competent.  I think some women just tend to struggle with the idea that building someone up doesn't detract from your own merit.  It's too bad.  Building people up feels so much better.     We just want to drink NOS and watch Tokyo Drift in peace.    This isn't a television commercial, but we have two super morbid radio ads up here in MN.  One is about boat safety and we get to hear someone drown while someone narrates what is happening in that person's body as they are drowning.  The other is about going through a windshield in a car accident and what exactly is damaged and how in your body.  Both pretty unnecessary.  To add stress to dismay, the car accident one also features sirens.  So you flinch and think you're being pulled over. :-/   I love the original flavor of NOS.  They even have a great website where you can put in your location and they have distributor data that tells you WHAT FLAVORS the stores carry!  The Loaded Cherry flavor is pretty awesome too.    If you're comfortable, can you tell me what sort of job you're applying for?  What you've got here is painfully generic and not specific to any one type of work... here is an example of a similar paragraph I wrote for my sister when she was applying as a bank teller:  I am a very service minded individual who takes pride in being able to identify the needs of others and to make sure that they are taken care of.  I am energetic, outgoing, and positive.  I love being able to improve someones day and to make people laugh.  I feel that I would be a great addition to your organization.    Well, you're looking at the difference here between making an open ended statement like "Sorry, I really don't want to intrude, it's just that I've been having trouble sleeping, would you mind keeping it down at 12am," which while perfectly reasonable could still backfire on you, and a statement where you're insinuating your roommate should live his life the way you want him to "Would you mind going out instead of being here after 12pm sometimes?"    All criticism usually ends in defensiveness no matter how careful we are with people, it's just human nature.  To be more specific though, if her husband is still hanging about and they're getting a divorce, your roommate going over there could result in him being assaulted.... who needs that on their conscience....? Even if he didn't take your advice, he'd probably think you're a bit off suggesting it.  I'd be very scared to run into a soon-to-be ex husband as a man.  I hope this didn't come off as condescending.  I swear, I'm trying to help in good will. :)    About a month ago or a month ago?  Most employers have a 30 day grace period in which either party may terminate your employment contract at any time. :)  Of course, you need to be respectful and grateful and apologetic.  Life happens, but if you go above and beyond to make it clear that you are only doing what you feel you must and feel very guilty about it all, they will likely harbor no ill will.    If you've already decided that you don't really want to mention it, you can take the path of least resistance.  I have this at my house, and it works great, you just need to make sure you put it in a central location in the room... it doesn't overpower noise, it scatters it.  It just sounds like a box fan: http://www.amazon.com/Sleep-Easy-Sound-Conditioner-Machine/dp/B00GFSF402/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8 qid=1432823103 sr=8-1 keywords=white+noise+machine   Well, like so many things, this isn't something that someone can do for you.... make you want to live.  You have to want it yourself.    I'm a huge believer in choosing things.  Deciding in my head and heart that I'm going to do something and leave no room for an alternative.  Being stubborn and having high level anxiety (so a fear of failure in any form) pretty much guarantees that I'll follow through.  You've said that you can't allow yourself to die and that you feel guilty for even considering it because of your parents.  It sounds like to me that a pragmatist would have grounds to see the opportunity to make a choice here.  If you don't care about yourself then give yourself over to the betterment of things.  Yes, you could choose to die, but that's selfish and will probably only guarantee that your parents will divorce at the very least, or kill themselves at the very worst. (Source: http://lighthaiti.org/the-connection-between-divorce-and-death-of-a-child.html)  That's a negative on a negative and doesn't make sense.  Instead, you should make yourself work to better things, to make life beautiful for people who can enjoy it.  I recommend volunteering for a hospice.  Many people are dying and have no family to be there with them at the end.  They are scared and they are lonely.  Government regulation mandates that 5% of all hours in hospice come from unpaid companions.  Maybe you should look into it.    I've actually (what a coincidence!) got to go to bed myself.... so just in case you think I might be on to something, here is a Mayo Clinic link for you... don't worry, it's not a big deal, just a blood test and some cheap pills: http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hypothyroidism/basics/definition/con-20021179   I've got a book suggestion for you: "How to Stop Worrying and Start Living" by Dale Carnegie.  You need to learn how to live in day-tight compartments as Dale says.  Good luck!     Have you ever had your thyroid tested?  This isn't something the doctor will do unless they suspect there is a need.  If you haven't had one, and you can't afford to go right now, look in the mirror, thyroid issues will typically leave a physical clue on your neck... it will look like you have a slightly puffy collar... almost like you have a hair tied under your chin and another just above your collarbones.   Edit: Photo Reference: http://www.steadyhealth.com/sites/steadyhealth.com/data/userfiles/articles/247980/Image/neck-swelling.jpg   Madeline Albright!  Prague Winter was amazing!  :)   Could he possibly move on ahead of you?  Set things up so you can join him in a few months?   Have you ever invited this friend to do something in the city with you?    You seem like a pragmatist; so I'm sure you know the answer here: Is this person someone you like enough to do stuff that's not your favorite with? If they are, compromise, say something like "Since you're always dragging me out into the woods, I figured this weekend I could lure you out for a steak and some gin here in civilization. :)" (the smiley is so you don't sound bitter when you say it)  We all have to do things we don't like for people we really like. Right now I'm stuck in the 80 degree car while my husband refuses to turn on the a/c, listening to music I don't like, and having to pretend that I care the Sox lost to the Twins today. But tonight he'll have to pretend he's not annoyed when I leave him with the baby and read in bed for a half hour. That's life! :)   Where you go to college isn't going to have much of an impact on who takes you on as a game warden, so if you really want to live in Maine, going to school there might be the perfect way to ensure you get a couple years in.  I mean, it's beautiful country... But there are so many beautiful places in these here United States.  You should see Oregon and Montana and Virginia State, and hell, even Northern Minnesota.  :)   Most states have job boards that you can sort by profession, here is the one for Maine: http://www.maine.gov/portal/employment/jobs.html  You can also check out the IFW website: http://www.maine.gov/ifw/warden_service/index.html  Here in other parts of the world, we call it the DNR or Department of Natural Resources... took me a minute to find the equivalent in Maine.  Hope this helps! :)    Hello.  I'm sorry that you're having such a tough time.  You seem like a hard worker who really cares about her family.  Have you looked into any housing programs in your state?  Here in MN we have a thing called 1 Roof.  If you meet a certain income guideline, you can just take a class on homeownership and prove that you can keep $1000 in your bank account for one month, and then you can get a mortgage without having to make a down payment.  They even have companion programs for if you need to do home repairs.  My advice is to look into what government assistance programs are in your area.  A lot of places also offer free financial planning assistance, so if you're struggling to budget, you can educate yourself.  I'm not sure if any of this will help you, but I hope that it does!     This person knows their stuff, inevitably when you are actually up there, your nerves will cause you to speak more quickly than you did when you practiced.  If you keep this in mind, you'll be able to maintain pace. :)   	101
 How is that a counter? Once you have an achievement you always have it. So if you are trying to not die one game, you can just get the cs achievement next game. You don't get all the achievements in one game.   Idk about ranked, but AD sion is just insane. The way I play him, I just farm for the first 30-40 minutes, and hope my team doesn't feed too much. Bring cleanse and ghost and just jump in a random team fight and try to win the game. Time spent farming can vary, but the health bonus is very much needed. Also I never go back unless I get killed, I will even ulti to stay in lane if I need to. The way I see it, if you have no kill by midgame they don't build to counter you unless they notice your 400 cs, if they don't counter your build or stop you from farming, you will end up 2 hitting a ziggs, or ulting your team back to full health.   Supportplank...awesome.  	3
 Because there is no force. If the bases were loaded, touching the plate would be enough.   Pablo rakes right handed pitching too.   35   Just bought Moneyball (book) today. Stoked to start it after the game tonight.    Pete Rose looks like a Cabbage Patch Doll.   Pablo Sandoval, you're the next contestant on "Who wants to win a $90 million contract."   My baseball pet peeve is when crowds boo timeouts, pick off attempts and mound visits.    Nothing but love for Nate. Good Giant.    And they say baseball is a sport for nerds...   Dude, that's exactly it. It's the chin and slicked back hair.   Welcome to AT T. Where homeruns go to die.   I don't care what anyone thinks, I fucking love that Jeter commercial.   Good, good, let the hate flow through you.   That's the greatest compliment you can give a baseball team.   [Until April, Dodgers fans.]( http://i.imgur.com/TaTdV.gif?news)   [Until April, Dodgers fans.]( http://i.imgur.com/TaTdV.gif?news)   The $200 million contract probably makes it pretty easy.   It was a no win situation for Mattingly. Pulling the best pitcher alive for one of the worst bullpens in the league would have been criticized too.    You should come to the good side. You get one every 2 years.   How the hell, in a NLDS game, do they not have a camera angle from behind the base?    This was a must win game for the Cardinals with Kershaw and Greinke pitching games 4 and 5. Should be an exciting end to the series.   #I'm up all night to get Lackey!    AJ Ellis stole Puig's hitting ability Space Jam style.    I hate it when people compare Matt Carpenter to Jesus. I mean, he's cool and all, but he's no Matt Carpenter.    Puig is historically bad right now...I love it.   Someone has this exact same comment in the earlier game day thread, Even down to the same misspelling of Nielsen.    That's the conclusion the author of the article came to.       Hunter Pence hates off days so much he had the team take a dive today so the series could continue.    From the looks of it, they're still in their seats.    In the playoffs, Bumgarner turns into Kershaw and Kershaw turns into Edwin Jackson.    We're used to stretches of no offense.   Like Sherman could even be in the same conversation as Griffey Jr.    Ishikawa is a completely different player now than he was with us in 2010. He used to be an automatic out that played outstanding defense at first. Now he always gives a professional at bat.    Pablo wants that $90mil.    Bum took a ball off the shin? That poor baseball!   It's gotta be his defense.   What exactly does this mean for the franchise? Why should I be excited?    If only I could maintain an erection!   TBS just plays the same five commercials on repeat.   As opposed to Detroit, where no one has a job.    I loved going to trivia night at Rosie O'Grady's when I lived in San Diego.    I'm curious, are any non-Angels fans rooting for the Angels in this series? It seems like the Royals are everyone's sweetheart right now.    At this point, the only thing Josh Hamilton can hit is a crack pipe.    Game going 19 innings confirmed.    Same here. I don't have anything against the A's themselves. Their fans on the other hand...   If half of the salty Tiger fans in this thread had bought tickets, they probably could have come close to selling out CoMerica today.   Red Sox/Yankees is definitely over hyped, but when they're both competitive it's a great rivalry. It was the best in baseball in the mid 2000s and will be again someday. It's felt forced the last few years though.    The AL West is odd because there are no great rivalries.  A's/Angels was pretty good this year though. It probably won't last though.   Vertical line   The last resort of a fan who has given up hope.   I agree about the A's/Giants. Most Giants fans generally root for the A's to succeed. It seems like Oakland fans are the only ones who consider this a rivalry.    Remains silent   Is this game seriously not a sellout? That's shameful!    Torii has a son named Money Hunter? Dear God...   KC was wild for the WC game and Pittsburg was wild until Crawford hit the grand slam. Every other crowd has been a let down. Looking forward to the Royals game tonight.    Nah, gotta rep your city.    It's easy to say Zimmerman was pulled to early now that we have the benefit of hindsight, but he had just walked the potential tying run to bring Posey to the plate. It would have been Posey's fourth AB against him and he had had a few good at bats already, including a rocket to third base last time.   This game is going 19 innings.    We got dominated for 8.2 innings, but still stole this one. Feelsgoodman.jpeg    Whooo?   Hudson pitched 7.1 innings of one run ball and he's not even the best pitcher for the Giants tonight.   *"John, this game is not over yet."*   I'm telling my my grandchildren about the first 9 innings right now.   I don't think there's a single person outside of the LA area that doesn't have the Royals as their #2 team right now.    Did I glance? Please. I'm still erect from that!    I've never seen as much salt from a subreddit as I see in /r/angelsbaseball right now.    Hala wala!    Which scrub did the Dodgers start tonight and when do they pitch their ace?    That kid behind home plate will swing at anything. Madbum needs to start with the chin music and work his way across the plate.   Really Kruk? It wouldn't surprise you if the best hitter in the NL got a hit?    Somewhere in the middle of game six in the 2002 WS, I commented about how sad the fans looked. That game and series turned around right there. I'm not doing that again.   Madison "Dad dick" Bumgarner    Seriously, who has sex without being wasted?    Who the hell cares what Curt Schilling thinks?    This silence is deafening.    [Aye! Que lindo!]( https://pbs.twimg.com/media/BjRPvHECYAAZcQ5.jpg)   Very good.   Hunter Pence prefers Hunts ketchup.   Likewise, Piratesbros.    He's been a solid bench player for us. Always has a professional at bat, has power and plays great defense ^at ^^first ^^base   [Let's do this!]( http://imgur.com/ZJGHNh3)   I'd love to face Kershaw twice in 7 games^no ^^I ^^^wouldn't   I've always been a fan of logos that include the letters of the team's city. It seems like the NL has more of that.   Can we have a moment of appreciation for MLB Network? After being raised on ESPN, it's such a refreshing change.   If it should come to it, rather than extra innings, the game should be decided by a competition between left fielders. Whoever is better at shagging grounders at 1st wins.   Best of luck, Piratesbros! I've never been a believer in having number 2 teams, but if I had to pick one, it would be you.    Let's just end the season after this game. No one can top this.   Time to send back the "Always October" sweatshirts.    Alright, I think we've all established that we don't like the announcers. We can talk about something else.    Ernie seemed so bored during that home run call I assumed it was a lazy fly ball to center. That made it all the more shocking.    #BOOM. YOASTED.    Best bullpen in the league.    Son, there are some things you should know about Missouri...   Something tells me we're not watching the future WS champions tonight.    It's fitting that a Marlins fan is confused by an excited crowd.    You jelly, bro?   Not until the bottom of the ninth in game 7 of the WS.    Unless there's two of them, Bridges is right by SDSU. They are offering $3 beers for anyone in Giants gear.    I feel like I should be excited, but I don't know what this means. Can anyone enlighten me?    2006 @ Miami 21-0   It's like watching the end of an era.     RULES    No picks that are favorite by more than -200     No parlay or teaser bets, single bets only, prop bets are fine     Please include what sport you are talking about in your pick     Pick with most points at the end of voting is our pick of the day    A's fans are like that younger sibling who is living a very successful life, but obsesses over their more successful older sibling.    That's a routine 9-4-2-3.    It's in the box score as a double, because he was thrown out going back to second. I just don't know how to show that he was retired.    How do I score that Belt double at home?    Says a lot about Jeter that he can get a standing ovation from the fans he absolutely tormented for 20 years. Baseball won't be the same without him.   	108
 Zero consequences. The ending of Taken pissed me off so bad.    25th Hour   Just say "3". Say it.  ^^^SAY ^^^IT   This picture had to have been taken today or yesterday. We never get snow.   Dude, that's his daughter.   That's also (hopefully) their order from worst to best.   You need to add "Because that's how you get ants!"   That's fucking awesome. I want one.    Some crazy, awesome shit goes on in Seaside, man. Last fall break, 18 different kids from my high school got arrested on different occasions.    That's it. Thanks. Was driving me crazy.   Just say 2 years.       You really want to be the guy who fucks the date guy? Nobody fucks the date guy.   But then you'd just be that weird guy that always carries dates.   That's fucking bullshit. That's Chic-Fil-A and you fucking know it, don't you?   Don't let the doc fool you though. The guys a fucking asshole.    You don't?   You look like a pudgier Paul Dano.    [Make Her Say](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmSV2cim0Qg)   You resemble Will Forte   Well shit. I was about to link you to Boogie2988's YouTube channel because your situations sounded so surprisingly similar.   Yes, and...?   You sound like a character from a teenage soap opera.    [Rorschach's Attempted Shanking](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B3lsJmwNO40#t=7)   Was recently blown away by **Prisoners** * Hugh Jackman * Jake Gyllenhaal * Viola Davis * Maria Bello * Paul Dano * Terrence Howard * Melissa Leo  There was no weak link. Everyone was perfect in their roles. I was surprised when I realized it had gotten little to no Oscar nods.   You think wrong.    I expected this to be a Blade Runner reenactment with snails.    being able to be who you want to be  "B - A - R - B - I - E"   Do. That was surprisingly heart-wrenching.    Don't think they're high as much as they're probably just bored to tears during a long-ass press junket. Still funny though.  Edit: Got three minutes in or so. Totally high.   He had to have planned it. Otherwise he wouldn't have been wearing the hat and glasses and overcoat. Plus, he knew he had to get do it eventually.    You and /u/chubbo55 might go to the same uni.    It just got cancelled, but I highly recommend season 1 of Hello Ladies with Stephen Merchant. Incredibly funny, especially if you loved the "cringeworthy" awkward moments of The Office.   Trisha and Ross are my least-favorite hosts for news, but my favorites on table talk.   If you had a million-dollar-an-episode budget, what myth would you test first?   "Hi, my name is God and I like to party.    I met Macklemore about a month ago. He was really quiet and all alone in a store in NYC. He seemed super sad and he looked tired as dicks.    Looks like I'm going with this. Thanks.   Oh yeah. One of my favorite "mind-fuck" movies.   Se7en is one of my favorites. Looks like im watching TGWTDT.   I have a kid in my class who talks like doge in public.  Everyone hates him.   If you are in for a longer ride and have Netflix, watch the BBC series "Luther" starring Idris Elba. Judging by the movies listed, we have similiar taste. I promise it wont let you down. It's incredibly well acted, written, and directed, and has some amazing cases and killers. The last two episodes of season two were up there with Se7en and Prisoners. Really good stuff.   The Strangers is the cheesiest horror movie ever. It makes no sense and it sucks.   That came across very terse and rude. I just have strong opinions about how shitty that movie is.   He says, having already clicked on a close up photo of the gaping head of a penis.    You wouldn't need to.    Philip Seymour Hoffman was. Not just saying that because he just passed, but the man made great choices with his roles. I've never been disappointed with a movie he's been in.   Well if it's just a picture of someone warming their spoon so they can scoop their ice cream better then the caption doesn't make much sense does it.   I watched Punch-Drunk Love last night and she played Adam Sandler's abusive sister. Wish he would've just salted the bitch.   He OD'd on heroin. This is someone prepping heroin for use.    SHUT SHUT SHUT SHUT   This isn't fucking offbeat.    Thanks. That's a high goof count.   This guy! I like the way he thinks!   Can any of you cowards direct me to an episode where Amir says "goof"?    ...so he did Die Hard?   Where can I buy one?

Looking back at it the guy has an amazing track record.   Directed by Alfonso Cuarn's crazy Thai cousin.   I am pretty upset that the entire cast of Hustle got Oscar nominations, yet no one from Prisoners did. EVERY performance in that movie blew me away.   /r/MoviePosterPorn    Fuck off, Jim Crow.    He's in a huge war movie blockbuster coming out this summer with Brad Pitt. So probably just a few months.    Can someone link me to the proper images? I'm getting a giant red banner than says "DANNY - are my bitch - you will obey"   Is there one of these for each state?   http://imgur.com/4TyINrO  Same thing happened to me at Pet Smart.    Well fuck. Fuckity fuck.   http://lawandorder.wikia.com/wiki/Serendipity  This one?   I know it's not going to happen, but Fassbender is such a suave bastard.   Craig's got 2 more movies left. I think they'll go with a relative unknown, although I pray for Fassbender.   I love it. The only thing I would change is that I would allow his hair to breach the border and not be cut off. It might give it a more three dimensional look. I'm just nitpicking because you asked though, I think it's awesome.       Try /r/tipofmytongue. They're great with these kind of things.   [This is a screenshot off of her YouTube. I couldn't find a better picture.](http://imgur.com/XTjVhyq)      She had to cut most of it off after complications that came from what they had to do to it when filming American Hustle.

 Although I like all of them I think I'm still leaning towards DGM. White and Blue are awesome but they're so overdone, literally everyone has one of those two colors.   Nice! I'm in Ontario too :D   I'm about to purchase a 16' STi Sport and can't decide on the color. I have it down to WRB, White, or DGM. I'm leaning towards DGM but not 100% sure yet. What do you all think?   Was also wondering, how much were the protective measures you took at the detail-er if you don't mind me asking?     Is this the DGM? Been debating what color to get for my STi. This really makes me lean towards your color lol   My Impreza is white, does the fact that the interior is red/black bother you? lol. I'm down to either white, blue or DGM.   My current Impreza is Satin White and I love it, although it gets dirty so easily    I normally don't like blue but the STi is an exception, really speaks to the Subaru heritage. Although the black/red interior makes me OCD run wild as it doesn't go with blue at all IMO lol   glad you got it working :)   congrats! I'm picking up one myself soon. Still can't decide between wrb or white.  	10
 spooky.   exactly    they're ghost.    I believe the toys didn't free them, just brought them together. When purple guy is killed they finally get their revenge and are freed. I also think the original child (The Puppet) was killed in fredbear's which is probably why they were so quick to sell to Fazbear Entertainment. That's just what I think though. We'll probably never know all the answers to the story, we just have to work with what we have.   they're ghost...   well thats why i put 'might be'. Also i doubt Scott is making FNAF4. The series had its good run and started a good community. Actually, maybe not a good community..whatever.  	6

 I'm calling this now, and I hope I'm wrong, but I'm worried they're going to screw up the scene of Tyrion strangling Shea.  Either it won't happen at all, or it'll be a lot more tame. Seems like something the producers would deem "too brutal" for one of the show's hero's to do.   It's not the same company. Squaresoft is dead. The franchise has changed and will never be the same. We must look elsewhere.      That's awesome- congrats    Going by how many rings Eli churns out I'd say he's making the most of that dough, compared to let's say...Aaron Rodgers.   Cool!   Specifically I'm looking to buy some protein powder. Is there somewhere I can go to get a reasonable deal on this? Or is taking the train all the way uptown to Cosco my only option?   Tuck rule.      Do you have a link to fangraphs write up on him?   Can't find it.   Concerned the tofu may go bad, only cooked with it a few times.      My girlfriend wants to start gymmin it regularly and has asked me to help her along. I consider myself pretty well versed in the fitness world, yet find myself a little at a loss when approaching advise for her. Is there a specific routine someone can link me to that I can read up on, or just advise in general. As far as her goals: lose weight and tone up, generally just be healthier.  Thanks!   The best sushi I've had in manhattan is at Sen (flatiron district), keep it mind it's a bit expensive.  As far as cult videogame stores, can't go wrong with 8bit on St. marks.    Found a still image of it: http://www.edmontonjournal.com/sports/cms/binary/9764915.jpg   After Lawrie's three run jack, he's dapping people up in the dugout, reaches Melky, and the two of them grab eachother by the sides of the head and just start screaming excitedly at one another. It was so hilarious to watch, and I can't for the life of me find this anywhere. Help would be most appreciated- go jays!   Vonnegut.   If you're into historical fiction, Colleen McCullough is a BOSS. Highly recommend her masters of rome series.   If you dig scifi, I'd recommend Stranger in a Strange Land- pretty hilarious but also has some great commentary/insight on humanity in general.  For literary comedy though, everyone should read A Confederacy of Dunces at some point.   I realize requesting a suggestion like this is a reach, but I can't help trying to scratch this itch. Recently re-watched the film Eyes Wide Shut, and was curious why I hadn't heard of a book which was similar. This seems like such an intriguing topic to me. I know there are many mystery/crime novels set in New York City, but I'm looking for something that focuses more on "high society" so to speak.  Thanks!      Turn off the inner monologue. Be yourself, be jovial, don't give a fuck.   Just as bad.    I'd rather have mccutchen and iwakuma. Elite offensive talent is much harder to come by than good pitching, iwakuma's numbers last year were terrific- I'd give him a chance first this year.  Don't do the deal.   My post is in response to this injury news. Fresh off the surgery announcement I don't see how his value could get any lower.   What you guys think? Was going to offer Melly Cabrera for him.   Watching on gamecast-can someone describe what happened?   Keep an eye on this guy Karnes they've got. Was competing for a role during spring. Has a tremendous K/9 rate in the minors. I'd prefer him over bedard/ramos.   Hey Mike, Great job on your columns. Razzball's the best fantasy website out there.  Assuming Matt Moore's elbow injury is serious, who do you see taking over the role in the rotation for the rest of the season?   In a heartbeat!   I'd do it. Ventura could be a ROY ace, Hamels could suffer from shoulder issues all season. Fantasy baseball is all about taking gambles- I think this is one worth making.   Dawg you gotta have Wong on your squad.   Keep kershaw.   I like your team, nice work.  I'd say freese/gee could be dropped depending on the talent available via waivers.   Great post!  Refreshing to see one of these on this sub.   I'd do it   I'm weary of Perkins simply because he's on the twins. They aren't going to win a lot of games this year, thus less save opportunities. Soria/Johnson are top of my list this year.   Scheppers/Quintana. I like Josh Johnson in the long haul but he's most likely gonna be DL'd for about a month.   People are high on him this year. You don't want to log onto reddit tomorrow morning and see the post "Some fool just dropped Fister, who do I get rid of for him."  To my knowledge it isn't a sever injury. If it's your first year and you're not that comfortable make trades, place him on your league's trading block and let the offers come to you. Any offer you get you can consult with this subreddit and typically get good advice.   I'd take Rollins, Jeter, A Escobar, and Gordon over him. If you already have Baez, without question keep him stashed.   I'd hold on to him- I'd be shocked if you couldn't find someone interested in trading for him.   Every team in an 8 person league looks stacked, too difficult to rate. My guess is clever trading is what wins you the title.   Hard to make a decision surrounding someone as risky as Abreu. Let's say he lives up to part of the hype and puts together a good first half- then yes the trade is worth it. Your rotation is strong enough to lose Cobb, however I'd wait and see what Abreu is first.    Definitely a solid team- congrats. Who's available on the waiver wire at SS?   Without knowing anything about your league, I'd find a top level outfielder you want, and offer that owner Posey + Mediocre Outfielder you own(say a cuddyer).  Would be easier to answer this question by showing the rest of your team, scoring system, and the outfielders that you want.   Kolten Wong and Neil Walker are better than both those fools.   I like the trade for you. You come out with tremendous rotation depth. Can butler go in a utility spot? Even if he can't, he can be a top of the line bench warmer, or package him in a trade to get an outfielder.   1. Hutchinson  2. Alvarez  3. De La Rosa   Thanks for the response!  So you'd recommend starting Davis over Cuddyer regardless?   I like loney, but best bet is going on a matchup by matchup basis.   H2H 6x6  My rotation needs the upgrade- should I do this trade?  I'd be replacing Cuddyer with Khris Davis.   Yeah you'd be getting raped, segura is top 3.   I think pablo sandoval is poised to have a monster season, you could probably buy him cheap off someone.   Whoa "Law of the Wolf" cover is guaranteed to give me at least several nightmares. These are impressive- inspiring collection thanks for sharing.   When I say "cue" it means it's something I'm anticipating. If I'm wrong, then that's a good thing.   Indy fans have a history in this sub of blindly defending him, I'm glad they're not living up to my expectations.   Cue all of these Indy fans defending him. I'm so sick of this classless owner. What if he killed someone? Born with a silver spoon in his mouth and can't take it off the bottle. An embarrassment to the organization. I'd take Snyder/Jerry over him any day.      I chuckled solemnly, whilst shaking my near perfect visage at the panel of self-proclaimed specialists, "The decision, my fellow mortals, falls into your laps, not mine."  The stirs of uneasiness crept along the semi circle of listeners in waves, from those dimwitted enough to have to think on my words and those who already shared my thoughts.  I smiled. An amused, sardonic, smile, one the writers of this moment would most assuredly classify as evil. The panel speaker cleared his throat, "Could you expand on that response a bit, Sir?"  A cigarette of some sort would certainly make this upcoming monologue of mine more dramatic. I sighed, regretfully. "You see, gentleman and gentleladies, you look upon the most cutting edge technology produced by the natural phenomena known as evolution. This is what the new human looks like as we stare straight ahead into the brittle future of humanity. You ask me to sacrifice myself. In order to save those that must be left behind simply do to the natural order of humanity. You ask to stunt the growth of evolution, in order to selfishly save yourselves from your DNA-ordained fates. Now, I could fall onto my instinct of self preservation in order to justify my refusal, but it would be disingenuous to lie to the lesser breed like that. The moral quandary you see, is not mine, but yours. Will our society allow you to murder every evolutionary breakthrough our species has in order to preserve the flawed masses?"  My mouth held a taste of metallic and hot blood. I craved the cigarette now not for vanity's sake but to cover the death which permeated my glands. The stares that met my eyes, and the stares which gazed deep into the future had already answered the question. And I amazed myself at how instantly arrogance can transform into fear.   Great call, thanks      At some point the articles coming out aren't going to be discussing how it can be fixed, but rather when we should accept it's doom. Final Fantasy is dead. It isn't the same people that made these games, it's not that same power company that was churning out all those gems of games in the late 90s. Obviously opinion matters a great deal here. If you're somebody who loved playing XIII, that's awesome and I'm happy for you- just keep in mind that it's not 'Final Fantasy' by the standard they set long ago. So many of the 'positive' comments I read about the game are "I didn't mind it", "I thought it was pretty good"- a Final Fantasy game should make you stop playing for a moment and say, "This is amazing".   I found that whenever I was at work browsing this subreddit, I'd get super motivated to exercise. Just seeing discussion about fitness gets me pumped. Whenever I'm losing steam I pop open my alien blue app and start reading through threads. Works great for me, thought I'd share in case it helps any of you all. Cheers.   Does this have any relation to the videotape, Parasite Eve?  	64

 Thank you guys so much for your help!  It worked :D  But now I've noticed I have another problem, and that is when I open my blog on my Ipad, the menu drops down fine, and I can click on colorado and nevada, but california doesn't seem to work.  I click and click.. but it doesn't take me anywhere.  helpp :D  edited to add the new problem   Hi!  I have a photoblog http://www.test_subject6067.com and I just added the travel-at a glance page on the nav bar.  I made it a parent page to two other pages (California, Nevada), and I would like it to just drop down instead of always taking you to the parent page.  I'm not sure if I'm making any sense lol but any help would be appreciated.  Thank you!   If you make cold process soap, you could puree them without the seeds/stem and make pear soap!  I do that with fruit all the time.  Or maybe put the puree on your face like a fresh fruit face mask.   Yup I'm a girl :D  Best I can do is use my experience with shaving my legs.  Even then, I'm not using a brush so I have no idea the kind of luxurious foam everyone talks about when it comes to shaving your face.    I agree, most of the shaving soaps people seem to recommend are all tallow based.  I have met lots of people that were allergic to lanolin, so perhaps offering some with and some without would be the best choice.  ty!   I love buying handcrafted soaps as well.  I just call it "product research" ahahahah.     thank you for the tip on the puck being too small.  I had never considered that being an issue.  TY!   Scent right now isn't what I'm thinking about.  Just creating a great base is #1 :D    Tallow definitely turns many people off, but I have noticed that popular shaving soaps all have it.  There are vegetable oils that give vegan soaps a similar lather so I'll definitely be testing out lots of recipes.  I agree samples is king! lol   I will definitely try using a brush and a razor to shave my legs to test out the quality of the lather.  And I definitely agree with you on the adding bentonite clay and calling it shaving soap phenomenon .  All it seems to do is add a little slip.  Definitely not the great lather I've seen on many youtube videos demonstrating shaving soap.  Thank you for the advise :D    Thank you so much!  Many of the oils used to make a foamy, bubbly soap can be drying.  That's why it's a balancing act.  I really appreciate the help :D   Hi illsolvethat!  Thank you for helping me out.  I love using grassfed tallow!  Soaps made with tallow gets lots of great foam.  I was wondering, is moisturizing an important aspect to a shaving soap?     Hi everyone!  I've been a soap maker for 10 years and recently decided to start selling.  I would love to make some great shaving soaps to add to my line.  Since I don't have a beard, I'm not really sure what makes a great shaving puck.  There are lots of glycerin soaps that give extra lather, but do you guys think that they perform well enough? Do you guys have a preference when it comes to an all veggie soap or one made with tallow or lard?  Do you like a soap puck that comes in a container already or prefer a puck by itself?  Thank you guys so much!     90% of the time I use self checkout, a cashier still has to come over to punch in codes or something...    Hi everyone!  I've been keeping a worm factory worm bin on my balcony for the last 3-4 years very successfully.  I've always seen a couple of maggots in my bin, but not a lot.  I just pick them out and toss them.  Suddenly in the last 2 months there's been more but today I just checked and I couldn't find any worms in the top 2 bins!  Everything I see moving are small maggots!  Now.. I'm not sure exactly what I should do.  If I stop feeding them I'm afraid that my worms will starve (I think they are already) but there seems to be too many for me to pick out.  Any help would be appreciated :D   Progressive insurance.  Ehhh Flo...    Ripping the warning tag off stuff...freaked me outttt   Omg yes! I like soy sauce + finely minced garlic on mine.  Delicious!   Hi guys! I had a quick question regarding batting.  I'm really interested in starting to quilt but wasn't sure where I should buy batting that has the best prices.  I've looked at Joann's, Walmart, Michaels.. but wasn't sure if there were other options.  Any help would be appreciated :D   We reuse all of our plastic bags from grocery stores as trash bags or as doggy poop bags.  Now.... we are just going to have to buy more plastic bags.  Danggg   YES!  And I loved how the upstairs bedrooms all opened to the outside balcony and not an indoor hallway.  The outdoor shower was pretty fantastic too.     I shot there a few times.  It's a beautiful property.  At the time he was building a movie room and a party room... I wonder if those are finished.     Yes this please!!!    Your brother is freaken hilarious on Dexter!  Yay for a funny Asian guy on a hit show :D    OMG please please fire him.  I can not stand Benjy anymore.  I don't know if it's cause he's getting older?  If Elisa is driving him crazy, but Benjy is just becoming more delusional and less funny rapidly.   I want to like her...but sometimes she is really irritating on the show.  She has no clue that she comes off as being really annoying and that makes me feel kind of bad for her.  The worst was when she kept apologizing to Benjy by saying " I'm sorry you were offended " EHH!!!    Yeah definitely a bigger cab with our luggage and carry ons.   We will be on the east coast so there will be 2 full sized luggages and 5 carry ons along with purses, etc.  I figure pulling everything during rush hour can't be fun.  It does seem like getting a larger cab and splitting it is cheaper than renting a shuttle for $20 a head.     Yes I agree, I'm almost 100% sure we'll just take a bus to AC.  AC to DC... we might just rent a car and split it.  Now I"m just trying to figure out the toll roads situation.  I don't even have an idea of about how much it will cost since it looks like we'll be hitting up 3-4 toll stops.   Well there's definitely no deadline to DC.  I've just looked from google maps and it seems like we'd have to transfer a few times.  The idea of us dragging our luggage around seems like it may turn into a lot of work... hahahaha   The Greyhound seems to only take 2 hours 30 minutes so it's not too bad, but it's 5 hours to get to DC from Atlantic City since it goes through Philadelphia.  I will definitely check Ri Ra!  I'm not sure if we'll be leaving the boardwalk area but thanks for the tips :)   I did see that Amtrack is SUPER EXPENSIVE.  I would LOVE to take the train but wow.. the prices.  I do think that renting a car would work.  I used google maps and saw that there are a few toll roads we would hit if we were to drive to DC.  Is there a website I could check how much the tolls would cost?   I think we'll Greyhound it to Atlantic City.  The free slot play is pretty tempting.. lol.  As for getting to DC... I saw that the bus takes 5 hours, but driving would only take 3.... so many things to consider.    The only shuttles I found cost $20 per person.   Hello East Coasters! 5 of us will be in NYC till Friday and wanted to check out Atlantic City before we leave.  I wanted to know if you guys had any tips on how to get there from Times Square.  I saw that there are a few bus options and was thinking about trying Greyhound's Lucky Streak.  Is that a good choice?    After a fun Friday in Atlantic city, we will have to travel to DC on Saturday and needed a recommendation on how to get there.  Are there bus options?  Should we subway it?  Rent a car? Any tips would be appreciated! Thank you ahead of time :D   lefferts = awesome.  Thank you for your tip :D   Thank you so much!  $58 + tip is not bad... and would definitely be easier than jumping on subways with all our luggage.  I'm afraid we'll get ripped off cause they can tell we're out of towners lol   Hi guys! 5 of us are traveling to NYC this coming Monday and wanted to know what is the best way to get from JFK airport to our hotel in Times Square.  We will have luggage and there's 5 of us so I figured getting regular cab would be impossible.  I would love any tips you guys can offer.  Thank you!   You're photogenic! I must be really ugly in person :(   Maybe you can get a detachable shower head and hold it on your head while tilting your head backwards.  Less water dripping down your face!

 You have a responsibility to your students to keep the environment of your class safe and conductive to learning. Having someone who is not participating can be distracting and throw off the energy of the practice. I think you did the right thing, have you checked with other co workers to see if it has been an issue in anyone else's class?   I would start by considering what you are looking for in a teacher and a practice, is there a style you prefer? Or are you searching more for a teacher you vibe with? I don't care for the brand lulu lemon, but the people who work in the stores tend to be pretty in sync with the yoga community. That may be a place to get started.  Best of luck to you!   Teaching is the hardest, most time consuming, and difficult thing I have ever done, but I wouldn't do anything else. My mentor said something great to me , I can teach you how to make a lesson better I can teach you to manage a class, but I can't teach you to love kids. I think thats what makes a good teacher, it is how much do you care about your students . I love my kids so I push myself to make better lessons , I make sure I do everything I can to help them succeed, and I make sure they know how much I care. I have seen teachers who go into teaching because they love their content area , and those teachers burn out quickly , because no matter how much you love math if you don't like kids it won't be worth it in the end. Hope that helps some best of luck.   Thanks for the info, not trying to lose weight  (I am 5'7 130 lbs) but I just noticed that I have a lot of sugar in my diet, I love baking , and dark chocolate. I have a strong family history of type 2 diabetes and while I don't have any risk factors now I would like to try and tame my sweet tooth before it becomes a problem.    I'll keep you posted on how it is going.    So I would like to give up foods with added sugar in my diet for the next 30 days. I was wondering if anyone would like to join me, or if anyone has advice on getting rid of added sugar? Edit People have been asking why I want to do this, it is partially because of a family history of type 2 diabetics, but also because of the other health issues that seem to be related to added sugar. I AM NOT TRYING TO LOSE WEIGHT, just trying to feel better and hopefully reduce my risk for disease. Also thanks for all the support r/vegan    There are different certifications for yoga teachers, and they are typically done by hours 200 hour 500 hour ect. I am not sure how they measure the hours though.   I am learning so much ab electricity from this thread   yes , but most people die at a certain voltage , because of a skin mutation he can withstand, and have a fair amount of control over electricity    source?      If you meet someone who is great date them, if you are happy being single and no one strikes your fancy then be single. I will say that dating in college is like an experiment and it is likely that at no other point in your life you will have as many variables. i.e. there are many different types of people to date in college and this can help you figure out what you are looking for. I had one of my worst boyfriends while I was in college followed by one of the best. College is about figuring out who you are and what you want out of life if you want to do that by your self great if you meet someone to share in your adventure of self discovery then thats great too. Hope that was helpful.   I started a new job that I love. I met the love of my life. I moved into my first place by myself.  My SO and I moved in together and then 2 weeks later he got a great job opportunity 6 hours away and he moved out , now we are doing the long distance thing   I was never overweight, but I lost 10 pounds by going vegan ( I was already a vegetarian), cutting back on the wine I drink , and hitting up the gym 3 to 4 times a week. I did all of these things to feel better not to really to lose weight  but small changes add up.    Daiya vegan cheese , cheese was the one thing that was super hard for me to give up and nutritional yeast only does so much. I love Daiya it melts it is yummy and I can have a grilled "cheese" with tomato soup.   thanks !   I loved psyc, but I got out of college and I was bar tending to make ends meet, I had planned to go to grad school and become a counselor but I wanted to take some time off. Part of being a bartender is talking to people listening to problems I was good at it but I was exhausted by it (I am sure that the 12 hour shifts didn't help) and you can't really offer any real solutions, you can just listen .I figured I needed get a better feel for if I wanted to be a counselor, I started working for a crisis hotline that too left me feeling burnt out. I went a head and applied to grad school , a few psyc programs and a couple education programs . I got into a few schools and I decided to go with education , I had a real tough time when I was in middle and high school , and it would have been much worse if it wasn't for a few out standing teachers. I felt this was a way for me to help people , that was sustainable for me. I love my job , it is very challenging, and time consuming, but I wouldn't trade it for the world.    Well I teach high school now, so some times I accuse my students of having Landau-Kleffner Syndrome, a disorder where children forget how to express themselves or understand their native language.   I suppose I could be delusional, but I am very aware that it is just for fun in my own mind, and that the majority of people aren't suffering from a psychological disorder.    BS in psyc MA in education   Abnormal psychology, I got a psyc degree before I became a teacher and spent a lot of time studying abnormal psyc. I found it fascinating and terrifying at the same time. I have a deep seeded fear I'll get dissociative fugue at some point in my life. I also secretly diagnose everyone with very mild forms of psychological disorders in my head just to keep myself from forgetting the symptoms.   but why ? Are their genes that tell them to move back ?  How come bones don't move after they are set ?   yes link please   So I understand that braces are put on to straighten teeth, but why when the braces come off do some teeth move back to their original placement unless people continue to wear retainers?   I am a teacher so I am on my feet all day, I love the look and feel of leather shoes , but not the suffering. I have bought many Vegan "leather" shoes, but they tend to fall apart, give me blisters, and look a bit cheap. Please help me find some stylish, comfortable, and durable shoes for the new school year!   I find the most effective argument to go vegan is, to show people that you are happy and healthy. People always ask why I choose to eat this way and I tell them because of the environment and animal cruelty, I typically leave it at that, but I may say if they are interested to check out book x or documentary z. Its not preachy it encourages them to seek out their own answers. It also doesn't hurt that I am lean, unfortunately a lot of women are only interested in veganism because they think they will lose weight (case and point skinny bitch) Oh and Peta has lost all credibility in most people's minds so it doesn't matter how loud they scream no one wants to listen.   Pros everything stays pretty clean, you can have sex where ever you want, lots of privacy cons you don't have someone to keep your pet company when you aren't home, no one to vent to about your day, those weird noises you hear at night can't be blamed on your roommate...so I think that someone is breakinginto my house a lot more   Just found out my SO will be moving 6 hours away, I would like to hear your tips, and stories about how to make it work.    Hey I just finished my first year teaching gov and econ at a title one school, I would be happy to send you a post card and lesson ideas , for your class.    Al gore ...robot voice   When I was in high school I went to a ci cis pizza buffet, my friends and I had gotten our plates and started to eat.I got some sauce on my mouth and reached for a  napkin out of the dispensers.30 or so little roaches started crawling out of the napkin holder and on to the table. My friends and I began to scream the manager came over to see what was wrong , he calmly picked up the holder and took it in the back their were still roaches crawling everywhere so we ran out , and never came back.   I'm guessing that if she is 23 then she just finished her first year of teaching,   so here are a few things I would have loved after my first year teaching(some of these are more romantic than others)  A trip to a museum, or historical site ( teach history, but this could be adapted to any subject or any interest) Replace some sort of technology that she uses daily ( printer, laptop, Ipad, etc) Or just plan an evening with her , take her to dinner, go dancing, check out a band, sometimes as a teacher it is just really nice to have someone else plan things to do.  Hope this was helpful, you sound like a thoughtful boyfriend   Ear plugs and an eye mask, in college everyone has such different schedules these things can save you if you have an exam the next day and your neighbors/ roommates are being loud...or if you are hungover and need to sleep it off while the rest of the world buzzes about. Speaking of hangovers keep gatorade or coconut water on hand drink half of it before you go to bed after a night of drinking and the other half in the morning, it helps take the edge off. Bonus if you can get the extra electrolyte packets that gatorade makes , check with your friends who are in the athletic trainer program. source :was a bartender in college and grad school   Octopuses have three hearts two are used for general blood flow and one is used for their organs. edit a word   Are you kidding me I encourage my seniors to become welders, or go into construction, if they know they dont want to go to traditional college, the military and police academy always come up for options too. Teachers need to realize not everyone wants to go to college not everyone needs too. Sorry your teacher said that welding is a great career.  	35
 The kid I was playing against has Peyton Manning, Andy Dalton (both on byes) so he picked up Big Ben and Eli Manning (you start 1 QB) and he started Eli. At least he has 2 empty starting roster spots...    Started him over Jay Cutler who has been great so far this season... Well not doing that anymore. This kid in our league has 4 QBs too so the QB depth for a backup is light.    I have Antonio brown Alshon Jeffry Victor Cruz Marques Colston and Julian Edelman. I found it easy I part ways with sanders and welker       Some friends and I were having lunch or dinner on a rainy day at my favorite chain restaurant when suddenly I heard an explosion and a few screams. I looked outside the window and saw some smoke and then heard more explosions and off in the distance I saw a lot of smoke coming from an old factory in the distance with tall smokestacks. The smoke was coming from the building itself and not the smokestacks. More explosions came and suddenly the smokestacks began to crumble down and then it was clear what was causing this. Oddly enough it seemed like fireworks were going off and there were so many of them that it was doing serious damage to this building. Sooner than later the while building was reduced to rubble and the fireworks stopped. After this we left the restaurant and I went to a house where these three girls were. I only recognized the face of one of the girls, but she was the only person of significance in this part of the dream. It was clear that she was interested in making sexual advances with me, but I wasn't taking advantage of them even though in real life I find this girl really attractive.    I've never had a dream like this where so much happened and I was hoping someone could interpret this or help with an interpretation. I really don't even dream that often - maybe once a month.  A lot of what I think are minuscule details were left out, but if you have any questions let me know! Thank you.    Standard ESPN scoring: Sanders (SEA), Welker (SEA) and Colston (MIN). Pick 1. Thank you.    It is so crazy! I don't understand Arizona!   So I've got my flex options this week between Julian Edelman, Andre Ellington, Mike Asiata and Desean Jackson. It's a standard espn league. I'm leaning Ellington because I think it's clear he will play and provides the most upside.    Yeah I try hard to not be that guy. Thanks.   Alright,  I'll definitely hang on to him. Thanks.    Pick that guy up!   Edit: I might have made an unintentional pun that could have been taken the wrong way.       I would go with Matt Ryan. You've got a beautiful QB situation here though. Can't really go wrong, but I like Matt Ryan more because he's go better targets around him and Cinci seems to give up a lot of yards.    The potential of Cruz would be enough to have me start him. Arizona does have a nice secondary, but Cruz is able to light it up if he gets the touches.   I would go with Decker. I think he has the better situation around him to score points.   Standard espn scoring: Marques Colston vs Cleveland, Julian Edelman vs Minnesota, victor Cruz vs Arizona, desean Jackson vs Jacksonville, Emanuel sanders vs KC,Alshon Jeffries vs San Fran. Pick 2   Standard scoring: Locker vs Dallas or Cutler vs San Fran. Seems like Locker is the better bet here, but I would like another opinion.    I've been feeling awfully shitty whenever I'm alone or not with people I know. This feeling started at work about 2 months ago and once in awhile I would find myself really in the dumps outside of work, but not too often. The longer time went on I would feel worse and worse outside of work. The last 3 weeks or so it's become so prominent in my life the only time I escape it is when I'm with friends. Even then I get an occasional feeling of hate for myself. I've been getting about 3 headaches a day the past week and I haven't been sleeping well. I've had a shitty appetite and I'm starting to hate everything about myself. It was suggested to me by my HR that I take some time off to try to clear my head. Tomorrow is my first day back in two weeks. Things haven't gotten better and I'm always alone at work. I'm scared to go back. I don't want to. We have a point system there and if you get to 10 you're fired. Work was a trigger for me so I've collected either 8, 9 or 10 in the last 2 months or so. I forgot how many I had so I could be getting fired when I come in tomorrow. I need money and I've applied to new jobs already just in case, but I know if I get fired it will be the most bittersweet thing in my life right now. I would've gotten rid of a large stressor in my life, but I would not have enough money. I'm 20, live with two roommates and go to school. My family is poor and I know they would struggle to support me if I didn't have a job. I have my own bills to pay and I'm really going to be screwed for a bit. All of my friends with the exception of 4 are away for school now and ude to school I won't have much time to see them. I'm scared things are going to get worse and my feelings will only escalate into something that could be troubling. I was recently rejected by this girl that I've still been friends with and tonight a friend went to a fair with her. When I asked that friend what he was doing earlier in the day (I wanted to hang out) he said he just wanted to stay at home tonight. I found out because the girl I like told me that they were going to the fair. That made me feel really shitty. My Mom's birthday was a couple of days ago and I forgot to at least call her. I felt like I was worthless for forgetting. It was 6pm and she texted me and she had to tell me it was her birthday. I really didn't want to live anymore after that text. I'm scared I'm becoming a huge failure and disappointment to myself. I want something bad to happen to me so I die. I know I wouldn't be able to take my own life from myself, but I don't think I would hesitate to try to save myself from anything bad happening to me. I don't see the point in living if I'm just going to feel shitty and scared all the time. I'm becoming extremely irritable, I find myself being quick to judge and then hate other people. I'm becoming an extremely bitter and pessimistic person. I'm seeing a therapist once a week now. I need that to help me. I need a lot right now.   TL;DR My life feels like a waste, I think I'm becoming a fuck up and I'm scared of my future.    As a united fan it cracks me up that both picks are tough ones, but for totally opposite reasons.    Hey I sent you a pm. Hope it helps.    Thank you   No, I just have no idea where to start.   So I actually got sent home from my job yesterday because I just felt myself on the verge of breaking down while there and I just couldn't work and I nearly broke down speaking to my manager. The last month and a half or so at work my performance has dropped rapidly without me realizing it and at the same time I've been feeling worse and worse about myself while working. I loved this job and now I just can't focus on doing it. My family has a history of behavioral health problems and that causes my anxiety to increase just by thinking about it. It also doesn't help that this amazing girl I had been talking to suddenly isn't interested even after she basically said she was.   So today I got up feeling alright about myself and I just go brush my teeth and I just start crying my eyes out. I had been feeling really crappy about myself the last month or so except when I'm around others and I think this rejection was the tipping point. I always think about suicide even when I'm not feeling down on myself, but the past month and half I've thought about it more and more and the last two days it's been all over my mind. I'm usually able to shake off these feelings of despair, but I really don't see any hope in the future and I'm not sure if I want to.    Writing is awesome. It's impressive to be good at writing   What makes you brilliant?   Is that James Franco?   It's really tough sometimes though    ELI5   So this girl I've had a crush on for a whole now recently broke up with her boyfriend about two weeks ago. I've hung out with her a few times since and I'm really getting interested in her. I'm 20 and I'm really awkward when it comes to these situations so I'm not sure how to handle it. I definitely want her to know I'm interested and I've tried to by giving her compliments (not too many), but I really don't want to come on too strong since I've heard her say to her friends she doesn't want to rush into a relationship. I know she doesn't think I'm bad looking and at least as good looking as her ex and we get along great. Ask any questions you all need, I'm appreciative of any help I can get.          Lol thanks   I sleep nude and I sleep walk   Alright I think I can do this. Thanks.   Yeah I try to avoid compliments until later on anyways.   I stole 3 snicker bars while I was a cashier at my first job. Never caught - I'm a good thief.    Brilliant idea! It has slowed down, but it's still happening. I'll give it a week. Thank you!   Weird prank    And I'm a straight guy. I typically message them back most of the time and try to tell them I'm straight and not interested in the most polite way possible.   I wouldn't say I'm mad this is going on, it's just a little weird. I've been on OKC for over a year and never had a gay guy visit and in the past week I've had 11 guys like me and 5 message me. My profile still says I'm straight.   Anyone having this same thing happen?    I'm really bad at flirting. For me it's normal conversation or making fun of someone slightly.    I overthink messages.   I was thinking I'm too conservative in my messages. I'm not sure I know how to be flirty!    Yeah sounds about right.   I go full out on here. I do judge looks first, but then I go deep into the profile and their questions. Yeah, I guess it's not bad to know I'm not ugly... I guess.    I ask them about things in their profile and stuff like that. Maybe I just suck at communicating.  	45
 To give it a purpose!   YES!  	2
 Right now Super Hot is getting some buzz. In Super Hot, time moves only when you move. It's pretty interesting. Right now it's only a demo, but still really good and really fun.  Also, there is Receiver. Receiver is an ultra realistic shooter. In the game, you have to operate your gun like you would a real one. Taking it off safety, counting bullets, putting bullets in magazines, cocking it, etc. It makes for some really tense gameplay. Every time you spawn you are given a random gun with a random amount of bullets.   It's not my favorite game but one of my favorites.  I always thought Bradley Cooper would be a great Nathan Drake from Uncharted.   Boy Meets World.  That or any Disney movie. Especially Disney channel original movies.   This is actually the case for most movies!   Me.   I don't have an under the bed. That's just another place for spiders to go.   Fuck.  It doesn't really make sense. In fact, a lot of the time "fuck" and its derivatives are frequently used purely to bridge thoughts and sentences.   There are plenty of words we could say in it's place, but it *is* useful to express certain emotions. It's the same with any swear word really. They don't make a lot of sense, there are plenty of words that could be said in their place, but they do a good job of expressing certain emotions.   Saw Nine Inch Nails. Absolutely fantastic concert. It had the best lighting I've ever seen at a concert and amazing stage design.   Nine Inch Nail's album The Fragile. Incredible, interesting music.  Also, apparently Rage Against the Machine's self titled album is recorded with highest standards and is used to test audio equipment.   In person? I saw a dead cat. But the way I saw it was like something out of a movie.  I was asked to take care of my neighbor's cat while she was gone for Christmas. One day I went over and saw Mulligan, that's the cat's name, sitting in the bedroom with foamy drool hanging from his mouth and he was making weird noises. I took him to the vet and the vet said it's probably just stress and to not worry about it. "It might go away when the owner gets back."  So a few days later I walk over to my neighbors house to feed him and check up on him. I opened the door and the whole house is silent except for the Beethoven-esque music playing on the radio(we turned the radio on to keep Mulligan company). So this beautiful orchestra music is playing and I look down the hall and all I see is his tail sticking out. I called his name and he didn't respond.  I walked down the hall and there was Mulligan, dead. He was laying next to his toy, too. I checked to see if he was breathing and maybe just passed out. He was stiff as a plank of wood. He was gone at least 12 hours.  The whole thing was very eerie and morbid with the quiet calm house and this beautiful orchestra music echoing through the house. Sad day. Apparently he had a stroke.  I also hit a golden retriever once with my car when I was in high school. That was a tough day.   Look, I'm not saying that until we have evidence to disprove it, it's true. I'm saying that until we have evidence to disprove it we shouldn't rule it out.  Something may be ridiculous and unlikely, but that's not enough reason to say it's impossible. Not without evidence. Like I said, the lack of evidence that something *does* exist is not the same thing as having evidence that it *doesn't* exist.   But you're right. It is a two way street. The lack of evidence that something *doesn't* exist is not the same thing as having evidence that it *does* exist.   *That's* what I'm saying. No matter how ridiculous something is, without evidence to prove or disprove it, we can't rule it out.  I'm about to throw down another bad analogy. How do we know the sky is blue? Well, through science we know, but let's try another way for the sake of this analogy. A way to know would be to survey thousands of people. If you asked 10,000 people what color the sky is, it's safe to say all 10,000 will say "blue". So it's safe to say that the sky is in fact blue. I mean, how can that many people be wrong, right? Again, bad analogy, but it's the best way I can describe it.  It's kinda the same thing with the Bible. It's full of first hand accounts and testimonies of various people who have come in contact with God and/or Jesus and witnessed their, for lack of a better word, "powers". There *are* witnesses who saw Jesus heal the sick and afflicted. Now *how* he did this and the veracity of it is up to interpretation. But there *are* records of not only Jesus healing people, but also being resurrected. Around a hundred people *witnessed* Jesus being crucified and killed. And a few days later they saw him. Alive. Free of any scars except for the nail holes. Now again, *how* he did this and the veracity of it is up to interpretation, but there is a record of it happening. How could all of these people in the Bible be wrong and crazy? I don't know. But for right now, we have to kinda consider that maybe the Bible is accurate. Even if it is crazy.     But like I said, my Bigfoot analogy was really dumb. It wasn't meant to be taken literally, it was meant to just put in perspective the whole thing.   And also like I said, if you believe the Bible to be true, then there *is* proof. It's all written there. That's why I used Bigfoot as an analogy. Because the only proof we have are first hand accounts people have. Just like the Bible is firsthand accounts of people's interactions with God and Jesus. But again, this all goes back to faith. It's up to you, and only you to decide whether to believe it or not. And if you don't want to believe, fine, that's okay. That's your choice.   But you should never rule anything out. We as a human race don't know everything. We are incredibly smart and have made massive advancements, but we still have so much to learn.   I've said this in another thread but I'll say it here. The lack of evidence that something *does* exist is not the same thing as having evidence that it *doesn't* exist. Until we have evidence to disprove something, we should never rule it out. *That's* science.    I can't answer that because I just simply don't know. It's not about anyone being more special than others. It just happened that way.   However people still had to have faith. There were numerous people who didn't believe. Jesus was crucified because they didn't believe he was the son of God.    Do you watch any of your own shows? Like do watch every new episode of Archer or Bob's Burgers when they first air? Like as a fan? Or do you not because hearing your own voice creates some sort of weird disconnect?   Then like I also said, if you're the kind of person who needs proof of everything, then there's really nothing anyone can do to convince you.   No one has any physical evidence of God. Yet you ask for it knowing no one has it. Which leads me to believe that you simply don't want to believe.  So let me ask you: Do you want to believe? Because if the answer is "no" then there is no point in you asking people for evidence. Because there is nothing anyone can say or do to convince you. And maybe you simply don't want to be convinced, and that's okay, because that's what you want.   That's what I'm saying, the only evidence we have of God and Jesus doing those things is written in the Bible. It's up to you to have faith that the things written in the Bible are true. Even the crazy things like the burning bush, Moses splitting the sea, Jesus raising the dead and healing the sick and afflicted.   Experiences make people smart. You can study about things all you want, but until you experience something or try it out, you can never really fully understand it. I can read about how to cook a certain dish, but it's not until I actually try to cook it and tweak it that I actually *know* how to make it.  Now I'm not sure how much this applies to everything, but so far I've found it to ring true.    I don't know if this sheds any light on anything or helps at all, but that is kind of what religion is about. Religion is all about faith. If God came down in the flesh right now in front of everyone and showed us some Godlike powers and we all believed that this was the actual God, then it would eliminate the need for faith. We'd have proof that he exists. Full, undeniable proof.  Depending on what faith you choose to believe, if any, the reason we are here is to receive a body. A physical body. We wanted a body to be more like God and Jesus because they have physical bodies. Before the Earth was created, we were all in heaven. We were presented with two plans. One was by Satan in which we would be forced to do things on Earth against our will. The other plan, presented by Jesus, was we had free agency on Earth. There was a war in Heaven and those who sided with Satan were cast out of Heaven with him. But those who did side with Satan have a chance at redemption, which is a different discussion.  Anyway, those who sided with God and Jesus came to Earth. Here on Earth we not only received a physical body, but free will as well. This brings in the other reason why we are here: To be tested. To have our love for God tested. To have our faith tested. Now that we have free will, do we choose the way of God or Satan? Do we even believe in a God? This is basically our love and faith being tested.  If we have undeniable proof of God, then we don't have faith, we have science. And if we have science, proof of something, then there is no reason to have faith in it because we know beyond a reasonable doubt that it's true. This is a really dumb example, but God and heaven and all that stuff is sort of like Bigfoot. We don't have undeniable proof of his existence, but we have first hand accounts and testimonies of those who claim to have interacted with him. Those who choose to believe in Bigfoot are going on faith. The Bible, should you choose to believe it, is kind of like first hand accounts and records of people who have come in contact with religious experiences and Jesus and what not.   This all goes back to the core component of religion. Faith. It sounds unreliable, and if you're the kind of person who needs proof of everything then there's really nothing anyone can do to convince you. You just have to have faith.  I hope I helped, even if it is just a little bit.    Wait I don't remember that, when did this happen?   Yes this is it! Thanks!   In this horror movie, which takes place in a jungle type location(maybe Australia?), a group of friends go camping I guess? They swim in a lake and I think one of them gets leeches. The leeches make her sick and turn her into like a homicidal maniac? One scene that sticks out is when the friends attempt to trap their turned friend by dropping a net on her.   I don't remember thinking it was a great movie but I enjoyed it and would like to watch it again, but I have no idea what it was called. Help?   Someone asked what the creepiest Wikipedia article they knew was. I saved the post, but it doesn't show up in my saved section. Also, when I search for it, I can't find it. Did it get deleted? Or does someone have a link to it?   I'm curious about what event in your life led you to have such a vendetta against Mormonism. Why can't Mormons believe what they want? Why does what they do bother you so much?   I just fail to understand why you feel the need to ridicule an entire religion. It shouldn't matter whether you believe what they do or not, or if you think they are ignorant. You don't go around saying people's religions are based off of lies. Religion is supposed to revolve around faith, not facts. Religion is all about worshiping Gods we can't prove exist. So even if you don't believe what Mormons believe is real or true, it doesn't matter. It's real to them.   Also, why do you care so much? Do you believe you will be the great hero to all ignorant Mormons? The one who will wake them all up and make them see the error of their ways?   That's, like, not even the same thing.    You just said "probably" wrong. Because you *think* something *might* be wrong doesn't automatically make it wrong. Not unless you have proof beyond a reasonable doubt. The lack of proof that something *does* exist is not the same thing as having proof that it *doesn't* exist.       ITT: Mormon Bashing   You're allowed to believe whatever you want to believe and whatever, but how could you possibly know that the Book of Mormon is fiction? I mean, it's kind of dickish of you to basically say that everything a religion believes is false. You may *think* that, but you can't *know* that.     Poor Marv.   Anxiety   I don't mind comic book movies. I'm just tired of the idea that instead of Hollywood sitting down and coming up with original films, they look for what ever comic book hasn't been made into a movie, whether it should or not.   Like I said, I don't mind comic book movies. In fact I quite enjoy them, but it seems like lately instead of being made along side other original films, comic book movies are taking the place of original films. I know Hollywood is a business, but it sucks that Hollywood will almost always choose a super hero or comic book movie instead of taking a risk and making original movies.   What nights are the board game nights         So my friends are super busy with college and work so we rarely get to hang out, but I love going out. I hate sitting at home by myself.   What are some places or activities where I could go by myself and still have fun and get enjoyment and not feel weird being alone?   They don't have to be night clubs with loud music either. They can be jazz clubs, dance clubs or whatever. I'm just looking for some great clubs or bars with great atmosphere. I don't really venture into the club scene so I have no idea what the club scene in Memphis is like.   How do I learn what shows are where and when? Is there like a website or something?   I'm new, just starting out. I honestly don't have the slightest idea how to create a podcast. How to record one, and how/where to post it. What are some good resources for someone to learn all of this? Any help is incredibly appreciated!      Recently our neighbor went out of town for a few weeks and asked us to watch her cat. Long story short we went to her house to check on him the other day and discovered him lying on the floor dead.  After talking to our neighbor on the phone, she asked us to bury him in her backyard. So we got a box to put him in and when we picked him up he was stiff. Like a plank of wood. His joints wouldn't even move hardly.  What causes this? I know it's suppose to happen, but what happens in the body that causes it to become stiff and hard?    Recently our neighbor went out of town for a few weeks and asked us to watch her cat.

Would love to see an after shot   I know David Fincher comes from a background of directing music videos but who are some other directors who have directed music videos? Either before they were famous or after they became famous, I'm just looking for music videos by film directors.       So lately when I'm not home and out in public away from wifi, my phone will not connect to 4g. Like there isn't even an icon at the top. It didn't use to do this. It started about a week ago. It's a pain because it keeps me from doing ANYTHING that requires internet. What is causing this and how can I fix this? Any help?  Here's a screenshot http://imgur.com/390q1uY  You see in the top left corner? No wifi signal, no 4G, 3G or anything.   Why do you say that? If I said something wrong can you please correct me?   Yes this exactly. I haven't done anything different. Just one day there was nothing.   You're not getting too old. Rockstar tried to make a game with rules that contradict the kind of game it is. Open world sandbox games are not supposed to be restrictive.   I always thought it was more about the leather and less about cats. Like, he seems like a kind of latex/leather sort of guy.

It's a pain because it keeps me from doing ANYTHING that requires internet. What is causing this and how can I fix this? Any help?      Charlie's Angels. I love that movie so much.    I dunno, I'd show a 13-14 year old The Matrix but probably not Wolf of Wall Street.    "How much you wanna make a bet I could throw a football over them mountains?" - Napoleon Dynamite   I love it because it's so dumb and he's completely serious when he says it.   And don't be broad by saying Italian or Asian. Be specific! If it's pizza, what kind of pizza? What's on it? Describe what is in or on your favorite food! If it's from a restaurant, which one?   /r/nocontext   I think this is the best answer.    I'm super late to the party so this probably won't be seen.  The Tree of Life. I grew up in a very religious family. A family sort of like the one in the movie. I was super close to my mother and my father was a hard worker, so he wasn't around much. He was stern, didn't say much, and had a hard time showing his love for anyone. We all knew he loved us, but had a hard time saying or showing it. I saw the movie with my mother and we both cried. It was a very beautiful film about family, life, death, faith, and what it all means.   Even though I'm in my 20s, I felt like I was going to get in trouble by my mom for watching this movie.   It's hard to believe this is the same guy.   I'm wasn't defending Argo or knocking Lincoln, I was just interested in why you thought that. After your explanation I can see where you're coming from. Lincoln did have pretty great performances.    Question, What exactly did you find great about Sam Rockwell's performance in The Way Way back? I saw it and thought, while good, it mostly felt like Sam Rockwell being Sam Rockwell.   Really though? I mean I thought he was great but it felt like he was just Sam Rockwell in it. I'm not saying you're wrong for thinking that, I just find it an interesting choice.   I'm surprised to see New World mentioned. That movie was fantastic and Hwang Jeong-min was great!   You could also argue that Lincoln is a type of movie that has been done a hundred times over.    Wow, I never heard this before. It's fantastic!   Any song, anywhere, as long as it was a live performance. Links welcomed!      All I really listen to are 101.9, 98.1, 99.7 and 107.5. But they all play the same music. What are some other radio stations with different music?      Tree of Life. I think it's one of the greats. It's a super mixed movie. People either love it or hate it. Mostly hate. It has a pretty low score on IMDB (or at least to me it's low). And everyone I've talked to about it says its bad.    See the saddest thing about Paul Walker is that he was on the cusp of pulling a Matthew McConaughey. He was totally about to become the actor he was suppose to be. Running Scared is one of my all time favorites.        I'm not trying to discredit animated films or the people who make them. But I think it's more difficult to create beautiful cinematography in a live action film because cinematographers have to work within the realm of reality. They have do deal with real world lighting and what not. Whereas animators can kind of make it up.   Again, I'm not trying to discredit any animated films or the hard work people put into making them.    What scene on top of the train?   I think there was something to get. But you didn't get it not because you're not smart, I just think that the movie was super vague on its symbolism and metaphors. I think even the smartest people will scratch heir heads at it.    I still want to see him do a super hero movie.   I just can't find it for the life of me. Anyone else go here that knows how?   xXx (Triple X)?   I don't know how plausible this is, but it could be he simply didn't know he was plagiarizing.   What I mean is, have you ever thought of something or tried to remember something and then you think, "I can't remember if this was from a movie or book or dream."  There's a word for it. When you think of something and you think you're creating it from scratch but subconsciously you're pulling it from you memories of, in this case, a book.   Now I'm not saying this is what happened or even that it's likely, but it is possible.       For example, Sister Act 2: Back in the Habit is one of my favorites.  Also, it can be a prequel, sequel, threequel or whatever.      Man I would have loved to see Inception as a horror movie. I really want to see what Nolan can do with horror. And I would love to see what kind of creepy, horrific, twisted things would've happen since anything can happen in dreams. Would be very interesting.   I think it all depends on personal taste. I prefer TRL because it focuses on the emotional and psychological toll of war. I love SPR, and I appreciate what it was trying to say but its message was drowned out by all the action and violence surrounding it.  Edit: Wow downvoted because my opinion is different than yours. Thanks for encouraging opinions and discussion, reddit.    Also, the Elton John biopic coming up.   Yeah that was probably the biggest shocker of the award season last year. Everyone thought Lincoln would win everything.    Hugo was pretty and well shot. But Tree of Life was incredibly gorgeous. Easily one of the most beautiful films ever shot.    I would give The Tree of Life best cinematography. One of the most beautiful movies.   Also I don't know if it got a nomination or not but Samsara should have gotten best documentary.   And I still think its a crime Christopher Nolan didn't get a best director nomination for Inception.   Also I'd give Into the Wild a nomination for best score, original song, cinematography, picture, and leading actor. Don't know which it would've won but it definitely deserved more nominations.    You say that but if I remember correctly (which I'm probably wrong) didn't Lincoln only walk away with just a few awards?   I *hope* it's Lupita. I love Jennifer Lawrence and think she's a great actress and I haven't seen American Hustle, but Lupita's performance was incredible.    Frances Ha is one of my favorites of the year. Gerwig was great in it.    I definitely consider it emotional. It's a song where you can feel his pain.   Ouch :(   Exactly.   Lately I've been trying to find music where the singer is singing with so much emotional power, it's like you can feel their pain. Their suffering. Their sadness. Almost to where it might even sound like they're crying or holding back tears.  What are some songs like this?      I watched [The New Guy](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0241760/?ref_=nv_sr_3) the other day for the first time in years and I thought it was pretty great. I wanted to know what those of you who have seen it thought about it.  I thought it had some really great physical comedy and had some great cameos by celebrities. Definitely one of my favorite high school movies. It even has a decent message about being yourself and not forgetting who you really are.  Any one here seen it? And if so what are your thoughts on it? It's not a movie that gets mentioned hardly ever.   It's not that. This article is basically saying, "Despite your opinion, these are the worst movies of the year and if you like them and think they are not that bad then you are wrong." At no point do they say, "Hey, this is just our opinion." They're treating their opinion like it's the correct one.   I like to believe everyone is going by the saying, "Out of sight, out of mind." I think everyone wants to just forget that movie happened. And the best way to forget it is to never mention it.   I really liked Wrong and thought it was good.   It's not the same song, but it definitely sounds like the same guy. His name is Johann Johannsson.   This looks so sick! I really really hope this doesn't turn in to another case of Man of Steel where the trailer turns out better than the movie. I'm optimistic though.    I'm late but I wanted to give my personal thoughts on it. There have been some great advice on here already as well as not so great. But here are my thoughts.   I feel like if two people love each other, and I mean really love each other, they will understand if one of them wants to wait. I feel like they wouldn't throw away their relationship with you if you don't do it.   Also I feel there are more important things I want in a relationship than sex. Now is sex important? Yes I feel it is. But I don't think you can base your decision of whether you love someone or not on sex. I want a girl that I can have deep intense conversations with and I can feel comfortable being vulnerable around them. If I find a girl like that and we love each other, and she tells me she wants to wait, I'm not going to throw it all away.  It doesn't mean she loves me less.   But this is all just my feelings on this.    I love them. They bring me back to a time when I was that age. I know most people would like to forget that time but it was the best time of my life. I love being reminded of it.    It makes it feel like I'm looking into the human body. Cells, nerves, all that stuff.   I know this has been theorized before, but it's so cool to think about. What if our universe *is* someones body. And what if all of our bodies are different universes for other life forms. And their bodies and so on and so forth. Infinite universes.     two many ears  FTFY         But why do you think that though?   You're right. I was super surprised to hear the many bad reviews of The Counselor. I mean, when you look at all the people involved in it; Ridley Scott, Cormac McCarthy, Brad Pitt, Michael Fassbender, and Javier Bardem, it's easy to assume it won't be anything other than great.   But based on the director and his previous works, didn't you know what you were getting yourself in to? I mean Nicolas Refn isn't exactly known for having fast paced non stop action movies. What exactly *were* you expecting when before you saw it?     Doesn't that kind of make it partly your fault? When you allow yourself to have high hopes for something, you automatically take the risk of it not meeting those expectations. Am I saying you're wrong for not liking it? No, not at all. It's perfectly okay to not like it.   I am curious though to know your thoughts on it.   I agree. I think people are over exaggerating how terrible these movies are. I mean, they're pretty well made movies. Are they great? Not really, but I've seen WAY worse movies. In fact, I actually kind of dug the super dark comedy/crime tone of Hangover 3.    I was the same way. OGF is one of my favorites of the year. While I realize it's not perfect, I didn't think it was terrible. People tend to think that "slow" and "violent" and "little dialogue" automatically means bad. I understand that many people may not be into that, but that doesn't make something terrible.   I don't think this is the kind of movie you see based off of what people say. It's a very subjective kind of movie. You should see it on your own merits. If it is something you might be interested in then give it a watch.   You need to get your expectations straight before you see OGF. It's not Drive. Visually it's similar, but Drive is a lot more straight forward and easier to watch. If you go into OGF with the expectations that it's like Drive you won't enjoy it as much. It is incredibly slow. It takes its time. More so than Drive. It is more like Refn's Valhalla Rising. I'd say that if you like Drive than there is a good chance you'll like OGF, just don't expect it to be another Drive. If you don't mind movies that take their time and are really slow, then give it a watch.   Exactly. I feel like any movie can be terrible if you had the wrong expectations for it.    I know she doesn't resemble the physique of Wonder Woman, but I would've loved to have seen Olga Kurylenko as Wonder Woman.      "How much you wanna bet I could throw a football over them mountains?"   Of course it's private.      This is very helpful! Thank you!   I was watching Jumper, and it reminded me of the sweet marketing it had before its release. Before there was even a trailer, Jumper had this really cryptic website that, if I remember correctly, was set up like a conspiracy bulletin board with weird photos and notes on it. Finding out what the movie was, was sort of like solving a mystery. The same with Cloverfield. Strange teaser. Cryptic website.  What movies do you think have had great, clever, or interesting marketing? Billboards, websites, teasers, promotions, or anything else that falls under marketing.      MLA format.  I'm wondering about how to do a citation for a movie? I've never cited a movie before. I'm wondering if I need to cite a specific quote from a movie, or just reference the movie then cite it. Can I just reference a film and that count as a proper citation? Or if it's a quote from a person do i have to cite the person who said it in the movie as well as the movie itself?      Specifically citations? I posted in /r/HomeworkHelp, but that community isn't super active with there hardly ever being more than a dozen people there at a time. HomeworkHelp is great, but I need to find somewhere to ask a citation question where I can get some feedback quickly. Any subreddits like this? I have to finish this paper and all I need to do is work in this one source I'm having trouble with. Help?   My essay is basically done. All I need to do is work in a citation somewhere.  My question is about how to use a citation. Can I just reference something and that be considered a citation? Or does it have to be a direct quote?   For example, my teacher is telling us that one of our citations has to be from this documentary we watched about The Black Power sign showcased at the 1968 Olympics. So I didn't really know how to use a movie as a source.  How exactly do I use a movie as a source? Can I put in a quote from someone that they said within the film and consider that a proper citation of the movie? Like for instance if someone said, "The stunt they pulled at the Olympics in 1968 is what propelled the Black Power Movement forward." If I put that quote in my essay, is that a proper way to use a movie as a source?  I really need help figuring out how to use this movie as a source. It's literally all I have left to do in my essay, and I cannot figure how how to do it properly. I've never used a movie as a source. Help?   Dat drum intro/outro   It doesn't have to be something exactly $50,000, but just think of it as that's how much you have at your disposal to spend on someone.   Edit: Screw it! I can't change the title so I'll put in this edit. I'm raising the limit to $500,000. I want to see what you guys come up with. I want o see how much good you can do. And so you don't have to rack your brain trying to figure out how to spend every penny of it, let's say you can do whatever you want with whatever is left over. Blow it, put it in the bank or whatever. But I don't want to hear what you'll do with what's left, I want to hear how you'll use that money for good.      The Matrix. Saw it for the first time when I was a kid. It blew my mind. It was the movie that made me realize that movies can be more than just entertainment. I realized they could be art. If it wasn't for the Matrix, I wouldn't have seen all the movies I have seen now. The Matrix is also what got me into film making. Film is my passion. I love watching them and making them, and I owe it all to The Matrix.   You look like a tv star!   Don't know if you have one, but I'd love to see a current pic? If that's okay   I think there's more than that involved when it comes to Oscar bait. When I think of Oscar bait I think: period piece, usually biopic, has an ensemble cast, they alter their appearance somehow, and is usually directed by an Oscar nominated director.   Things like The Kings Speech, The Artist, Lincoln, and even though it isn't out yet, American Hustle is looking that way. Now does Oscar bait mean "bad"? I don't think so. All those movies I listed are great. And even American Hustle looks good.    I'm the same way. I find myself playing devil's advocate a lot when talking about people with a group of friends. I don't like talking about someone behind their back. It feels...weird. It feels like I'm betraying them. I just can't do that. And if I do start to talk about someone, I feel bad midway through my sentence and back out before any damage is done. I guess it's because my parents always told me to "treat everyone like they are having a harder time than you." I don't know what kind of life this person has when I'm not around. I don't know what problems this person might be dealing with. And insulting them, whether it be to their face or behind their back, doesn't solve anything.   I don't know, man. They were either Oscar bait or had heavy handed messages about the environment, racism, or religion.   If that's the criteria we're going with for what makes something terrible, then I guess there are a lot of highly praised Oscar movies that are terrible. Wall-e's terrible, Americn History X is terrible. As well as American Beauty, Django Unchained, Gravity, 12 Years a Slave, The King's Speech, The Artist. I mean really, with the criteria you set up for what makes a movie terrible, this list can get pretty long.   But why though? I'm genuinely curious, not trying to start something.   Whenever 2004s Crash is brought up, almost everyone says it was terrible and "utter shit". I mean, it's not the best movie, and it shouldn't have won Best Picture that year, but I feel like I'm one of the few that not only like Crash, but think it's pretty good. Yeah it seems heavy handed with its message and it might have been Oscar-baity, but the acting seemed really solid. And the cinematography was pretty good as well as the directing. I mean all in all I think it's a decent movie at worst.  I just fail to understand why most people will say it's absolutely terrible and again, "utter shit". Could someone civilly explain to me why people think this, or if you think it then why?  I'm genuinely curious.    Yeah I love Saving Private Ryan, but I think The Thin Red Line is the better WWII movie.   Dude, was it oscar baity? Yes. Was it the best movie of that year? Not at all. But Crash is in no way a bad movie.   Everyone has their own opinion and to each his own, but I think "terrible" is a little strong. This was not a bad movie. It may have not even been good, but I thought it was decent and solid. What makes you say it's terrible?   Me? I mean when you look at who's involved it seems reasonable to assume it would be great.    I loved the original, but maybe I'm not as much as a hardcore fan because all in all I thought it was a solid remake. And I use "solid" loosely. It wasn't bad. In fact, it's pretty decent. I think as a movie it's pretty good, but as a remake it could have used some work. Maybe this will be a Daredevil scenario where the directors cut will greatly improve it.   When I said it felt rushed, I didn't mean just the ending felt rushed, I meant the whole movie felt rushed.   Eh, I don't know. I guess I could buy that considering it's a different country with a different character. And without spoiling anything, they do kind of hint at something that could definitely make that a possibility.   I watched Frances Ha and I really loved how it captured the mood, tone, vibe, and what life living in New York City is like. What are some other movies that really capture what life in a big city is like? Where it's almost like the city itself is a character? Whether it be NYC, Detroit, LA, Hong Kong, Tokyo, or whatever.   As someone who has seen the original I thought it was actually pretty good. It's not bad at all. Josh Brolin is great in it. It's shot well. It's definitely a good remake, but like I said, it did feel rushed. But all in all it was pretty good. However, I think if you have the opportunity to see the original, you have to watch it. Spike Lee's is good, but Chan Wook Park's is a masterpiece. But if you can't watch the original, then Spike Lee's is a good option. It stays pretty close to the original.   That's funny cause I just saw it and I thought it felt rushed.  	153
 Seriously the best food when going for a day out, especially for things like hiking or travelling (not flying obvs)   I just find it easier to massage around with one hand towards my fingertips, as I'm usually using my computer with my more dominant hand haha. I suppose I could just pump it onto my left hand but I really lack control.  Will the balm work well as part of OCM? I really enjoy the steaming part   I thought making us remove our water bottle labels was going too far.   This shoot deserves to be in Vogue.   Seconding this; bar street can be fun but its become pretty pricey (so is all of Sanlitun to be fair) and a bit repetitive. The clubs and bars around Gongti Ximen are definitely the place to go for meeting expats.   If you're thinking of drinking something different or are into beers, Heaven supermarket is a nice place to head to, its not very expensive and has a variety of drinks in a supermarket style but with a seating area to meet people. Personally, I prefer going there over the clubs.  If you're looking to meet foreign students (inc. girls) in Beijing, head on over to Wudaokou, its good fun, local pubs have things like Quiz nights going on too.  I do really recommend going to some night markets, the Wangfujing Snack Street at night is pretty good for tourists but be sure to haggle. Also, eat lots of street food (if your stomach can handle it), jianbing is definitely one to pick up.   I'm currently using TFS's Rice Water Bright cleansing oil as the first step in my evening routine but i find it to be too 'slippery', its a little too runny and I have to tilt my face back a little to make sure it doesn't run down into my eyes (I pumped it straight onto my face and begin massaging.... I know, its odd but I really need to maximise my study time). I do love the smell of this one though 3  Could anyone recommend a different oil with a bit more grip? I have blocked pores on my forehead and normal/combo skin. I also don't wear very much makeup but use the Biore UV gel sunscreen.   I really like the palette, maybe I'll get one after finishing up mu current finishing powder. I'm looking to buy my first cushion compact, will definitely keep the AmorePacific in mind!!   So jealous of your glow right now!! By the way, is it the Ambient Lighting palette your using? I'm thinking of getting one as people say that it gives you this radiance, but its sooooo pricey.   I actually got a sample of the Fresh Cherry tint in my Jolse delivery the other day! I'll definitely give it a go. Can you apply lip balm on top of it?   I have used the Mario Badescu drying lotion which is basically calamine solution at the bottom with alcohol at the top. I used to apply this, let it dry then wash off and repeat and this has created such bad scarring, as the alcohol completely dried my skin out leaving me with a thin scab. Once the scab came off, the skin underneath was very pale pink, a sign of tissue damage.  I received the Mizon Acence Blemish Out Pink Spot the other day and and it seems to be pretty much the same but it has castor oil as to not dry the skin out as much. I would recommend this over any other spot treatments.  However, if you need a transparent one, the Origins Spot Zapper works well too.   I'm pretty sure the BHA A-sol is meant to be spot treatment but most people use it as a toner, seeing as the BHA content is not strong enough to just use as a BHA.  If you use a higher pH cleanser, something like 6, maybe the AHA/BHA toner would be better as it would bring the pH right down to balance the skin?   I'm looking for a lip tint/stain, preferably something similar in texture to YSL's Glossy Stain and having the longevity of Sephora's Cream Lip Stain but I don't mid if its more matte. The only thing is, my lips dry out quite easily so I'm worried watery tints will seep into the dry spots.  If you guys could recommend any lip products, especially any red ones, that last long (through eating etc.) I'd really appreciate it!   I have double eyelids but they're uneven, one sort of folds at a different angle, so for the past 2 years I have been wearing eyelid tape during the night (so that when my face swells in the morning, it helps to take shape) and the days when I'm at home all day (weekends and the days I finish school early). This has been a very long process and I have seen some improvement, but I expect it will still need longer.  My cousin, who has monolids, has managed to create a permanent double fold over the years, by using tape to 'teach' her lids to fold that way. However, she still often goes out with the tape on, although so do many other girls in China.  Eyelid tape does and probably will do some damage to the elasticity of the skin, so remember to be gentle and try to reduce any tugging etc.  My dad also has blepharitis, and he finds that using salt water for a hot compress really helps when his eyes get itchy and red.   They're fake but they do the job, my mum went there when she misplaced her reading glasses and she got a pair of 'Cartier' glasses within 2 hours using her glasses as a reference for a script. She did say they ended up being a lot stronger though...   Hey! Welcome to the world of AB!! I'm pretty new to it myself but its been a really good learning process so far.  What's your skin type like? From what's in your cart, I'm assuming you have some PIH and maybe acne?  If it's those, I think your products will do a good job, I pretty much bought the same but I have the CosRX BHA returning A-Sol to use as a toner after cleansing as I've read that the AHA/BHA toner from CosRX has a really low pH of 3.85, which [u/SnowWhiteandthePear](http://www.reddit.com/user/SnowWhiteandthePear) blogged about [here](http://snowwhiteandthepear.blogspot.co.uk/2015/03/review-cosrx-aha-bha-clarifying.html).  Make sure to introduce the BHA and AHA's into your routine slowly, e.g. starting with just once a week, then slowing increasing or decreasing depending on how your skin responds. An overhaul of acids can often lead to purging.  To tackle blackheads and acne, I would start with BHA and the Vit C first (do remember the OST is an L-AA, so your order should be Vit C, wait 20 mins, BHA, wait, then AHA if using all three). The snail is also great as a light moisturiser, use it according to the light to heavy theory of viscocity.  I like to use the Mizon Snail Recovery Gel as a final moisturiser as I like the texture it leaves on my skin, its not too suffocating before going to sleep.         Yeah, the BHA sample is from them, I'm not quite sure when I'll be able to use it though.. it seems like such a small amount.  I tried everything last night except the AHA, but I'm going to put them through more use to get a better feel though. I found the CosRX Snail Mucin so weird though, I put one pump onto my palm and used my fingers to spread out on my face and it just had the biggest trail. The texture is a little odd at first but it did moisturise quite nicely overnight.   The waiting is the hardest part! The first 2 days I was obsessively tracking where the orders were but eventually I just gave up cause after I saw it had arrived in Europe, there weren't any other updates.  Excited for you to get your products though!!   You know, I honestly didn't feel too different after using this, probably because I usually oil cleanse with grapeseed oil and coconut oil (although I've stopped using this for facial cleansing now). I found the Rice Cleanser hard to lather up too, even though I used like 3 pumps, did you have any problems with emulsifying?   I'm a little hesitant due to the things I've heard about purging, I know you're meant to take it slow (giggledegoo) but I just want to rush in and see what clean pores look like!   Everything haha! I'm really excited/nervous to give the process chemical exfoliation a proper go, I've used Mario Badescu's Glycolic Acid toner before but it didn't do anything for me in terms of lifting my PIH, although it did give me a slight glow.   I've never used BHA's before so I'm hoping it'll do a good job cleaning out my pores, particularly on my forehead where I normally get breakouts.  	22

 What a gentleman.   Oh she's black. Surprise.   Jimmy's dad   Do like fish sticks? Do you like fish sticks in your mouth?   Father forgive me for I have lied about my age.   Did it win homecoming king too?   This would never happen at a McDonald's, where blacks work. Only good old country folk stores like Dairy Queen.   Fucking Obama care.   The bible says he who does not work should not eat.    They drive a Hyundai and treat animals like shit. They are Korean.   Yea but hockey is boring as fuck. If I want to watch a bunch of Tuff white boys play a sport ill watch UFC.   That probably smells so bad.   A group of noisy rude blacks, I would send them away in a heartbeat also.   Sigh, black ppl...  	14
 We didn't domestic dogs. They domesticated us. Read about the co-evolution of our fury friends and man.    Need to bring this festival to the United States. Good picture.             This new life came from the seeds and nutrients of the bird poop.   I had a near death experience from a mugging and experienced the same feeling.    Most likely but I would be cool if you didn't.    Good question.    Maybe we are all  one hologram of a "parent" universes black hole.       The buildings almost caught on fire.   I like it.      Did not know that. Going to have to check it out. Thank you.      Ok. Going to buy a big bag of lemons today. My side is hurting a little.    With or without sugar?   Thanks for input. I am going to try to cut down my coffee to a couple of cups a day and drink more water. This is not going to be easy but I hope this help because kidney stones are aweful.   T-mobile doesn't have hidden charges like verizon.    The United States is not a democracy but a constitutional republic.                  Should have won.            No problem. Have a good one.   The point is not the smoking but rather his own freewill and humor in the face of authority. In this aspect, he was ahead of his time.    He is currently died but his words live on. RIP.   I am not advocating smoking. Just like adults with independent minds and  speech styles. He was a little too much off a left brain analyst for my taste but  I enjoy his attitude toward irrational authority.    Not really into fiction. My short term memory is too poor to keep track of all the characters. Good at visualizing and understanding abstract concepts and macro theory.    He has a wild trance like cadence to his voice.    My dogs are littermates so they are real protective of each other and me at the dog park. Crazy little guys. They have the small dog napoleon complex.   Thought people would get a kick out of this old short video clip.   Like dogs better than most people.   Watch Terence McKenna's youtube videos. Don't take most of what he says literally but rather as philosophical abstraction.    Not the book but understand some of the story from philosophy websites.      Ever heard of the concept of reality tunnel.   They are my kids.    The mystery of life. I am not 100% sure of anything.A couple of years ago, I  had a near death experience from a mugging. The feeling was beyond words. It was like I was one with the universe.    Our universe could be one of many. There is a strange new theory that our universe is in the center of a black hole. In this theory, the big bang was the moment of formation of this black hole. If this theory is true, that means we live inside a black hole of a "parent" universe. I don't know if this is fact but it would not go against the known mechanics of quantum physics.   Awesome video.         Should have titled video: Caitlin/Bruce in 1980's McDonald's commercial.   And when your a kid.  	51
 The higher level ones always say "the remainder of the solution is trivial" and give you no clue as to what to do next.   That is not the same leprosy, the medical disease, of today. Does leprosy get on a house?   That sounds like a line from a math textbook.   It is widely agrees that the root is the verb "to be." The only difference whether it is causative or not. The different translations given are just poetic.   No, I am a **stick!**   Don't embarrass yourself by trying to tell Hebrew speakers what Hebrew means. The different translation depend on the verb inflection, not the etymology.   If it is idolatry it would be forbidden according to the Noahide laws.  And this becomes a Jewish legal discussion of what exactly idolatry is and how it is different for Jews and non-Jews.  And if I don't like it? Would I have to move or just accept it?  Accept, try to reform it, or move.     The same reason that as an American (or a citizen of any country), you have rights and responsibilities that others, immigrants or tourists, do not have. If David's mother is American and he is born in another country, he gets citizenship as soon as he visits the nearest consulate. You are Jewish the same way, it's just more automatic and cannot be revoked.     Everyone has to go through a period of atonement/spiritual cleansing. Non-practicing Jews just might have a little bit more to go through.    What is the purpose of saying he must technically keep the commandment if his actual obligation is waved?  How it is treated in Jewish law. Suffice to say that until he learns about it, it doesn't matter.  Humans are humans and if you WANT to be in this covenant, that's one thing. But, from my POV, it's completely unfair and unjust that my friend Daniel is given expectations because of his blood.  His blood and mine are NOT significantly different. Of course there is a difference, but the difference is not significant. Making it significant is a fabrication. A method of keeping clan-unity in the ancient world. We should, as species, move past this obsession with blood-line. It's unhealthy. It's unfair. It's unreasonable.  This is ancestry, not "blood." The blood is pretty much the same all around.   It comes down to a different system of values. Post-Enlightenment western values places a lot of emphasis on individuality, while traditional Judaism has more of a balance between community responsibility and individual desires. As an atheist, I assume you support the idea of moral relativism, of which this is a manifestation.   All I'm saying is it's ignorant to think that we can say with absolute certainty that the Big Bang is fact, same with evolution.   the exact mechanism of the big bang is still being researched, but the fact that the universe is almost 14 billion years old is proven by several different methods.    I'll assume you're going about the halakhic definition of Jew, Jewish mother or Orthodox Jewish convert. If you're using another definition please let me know :)  That is the Orthodox definition, yes.  Why would I follow this rule if I believe that not worshiping an idol would be bad for me? Also wouldn't Trinitarian and Latter Day Saint Christianity count as idolatry?  It is forbidden for Jews to practice it, but it is probably allowed for everyone else.  Would saying "I think the god of the Tanakh, New Testament, Qur'an and Book of Mormon is not worthy of worship" count?  Debatable, but probably not.  I don't eat anything with meat as the primary indigent but I do eat stuff with meat as a secondary indigent. I don't think eating an animal while alive will be a big deal to me. Also it is unsanitary.  Eating meat, in general is allowed. But with the cruel conditions many animals are raised today, there are actually arguments to say that this is being violated. Also things like shark fins which were torn from the animal before it dies.  What does this exactly mean? And what law?  A system of justice that society chooses for itself.   There is no eternal hell in Judaism, and no one is cast into "damnation."    Calm down. The situation you're describing is, in Jewish law, equivalent to someone who is taken captive. He is still technically has the obligation to keep the commandments, but he is not liable for any of them since he doesn't know about it.   I'm sorry, but BONDAGE that is inherited by children and their children and their children is UNFAIR. My friend Daniel is a free agent and he decides who or what he forms a pact with.  This is a different discussion entirely.   And the residents of the south will continue to suffer in the meantime. It's time to end this now -- it's the best chance that we're going to get.   But giving in to demands without anything in return is even worse, since it further legitimizes Hamas among the Gazan population.   A forced cessation of hostility because they ran out of rockets is much better in the long run. This ceasefire only allows them to restock...again.   A ceasefire? Now? I would have been a favor of one 10 days ago. But now Hamas has few rockets left, the majority of people near Gaza have already left, and the international community's attention has turned away. Now is the time to continue until they run out of rockets and force them to demilitarize, not to **reward** Hamas for shooting rockets.    It lasted 2 minutes   It was supposed to start at 7 but rockets are still being fired. So much for the truce, then...      Islam is not based off Christianity the same way either is based in Judaism.   It's linguistic, as the ayin in mizrachi Hebrew in guttural.   No one died, so it apparently worked.   It's the opposite. The casualties are disproportionately male, ages 16-35, compared to the population. Women make up less than 20%, children 10%   The quotes of scholars fall somewhat flat when there are people justifying terrorism in that very thread.    More kid Icarus and Dr. Mario aren't necessarily confirmed.   I have a Rangemax wireless router wpn824 v2. It doesn't seem like the comcast one actually has better specs. In addition, it doesn't allow nearly as much configuration.    We just got the wireless gateway, and it seems to have a router already installed internally. Is it a good idea to use it? Is it better or worse than a standard external router? Does it allow comcast any *more* power?  Thanks. :)   It's Exodus 19-21.    Micah 5:2 But you, Bethlehem Ephrathah, though you are small among the clans of Judah, out of you will come for me one who will be ruler over Israel, whose origins are from of old, from ancient times. 700 B.C.  This is not a prophecy that the Messiah will be born in Bethlehem, but will come from the clan of Ephrat near Bethlehem - i.e. the line of King David.     Matthew did not "make up" whatever ancient writing he was referencing to say this.  Matthew either made it up or referenced something of which we have absolutely no record today. Considering that the Jewish canon, including the prophets, was already codified at the time, I think the former is more likely.     How exactly is the Conservative movement heretical? Reform makes sense, as they reject the Torah as binding. Conservative ideology does not.      Do you want to hear about my dad's experience from 40 years ago? It might no longer be relevant. :P      I hope that it remains a good place for now, but a shift of evangelical opinion combined with demagogues using populist attacks against "Jewish banksters" -- well, let's just say that things could turn around very quickly.      America is...for now.   To add to your analysis, Israeli news is reporting that Hamas has around 25% of its rockets left, but only a few of which can reach beyond the area right near Gaza.   His dissent is pretty much in line with every major news source out there.   What is your answer? Currently it's "Iron Dome doesn't work!" Then why are there no injuries?   I am looking for a reason you can give as to why there are no injuries or damage in Tel Aviv. So far you have failed to provide one.    ok my bad. Israelis are the most awesome, most educated, most aware people in the world. They know everything before it happens.  If you lived in Israel then, you could see that the Patriot system didn't work, which is what people said at the time. If you live in Israel now, you can see that Iron Dome is working. How is this so difficult to get through your thick skull? Why do you believe a bad analysis of grainy images of eyewitnesses you said the true thing both times?     maybe the iron dome is 90% effective...but maybe it's just like with the patriot system and it's all bs.  Again, my parents looked out their window in Tel Aviv, and saw the damage being done by the scud missiles and how the Patriot system was failing. People look out their windows now and see how Iron Dome is succeeding. Are you going to respond to this point?   The point, that you clearly missed, is that what people THINK they know today, typically turns out to be wrong when they actually look at the details later.  And proposals vs. weapons systems being fired are two totally different things. At least the analogy to the patriot system is actually legitimate even if it shows how Iron Dome is working. A vague "wake up sheeple!" isn't going to convince anyone, you know.    You're right. I was just distinguishing between batteries (of which adding more in the same area would be mostly redundant) and multiple interceptors per battery, which are already used.   They are adding more batteries to different areas to ensure complete protection, for example if the north and south are both attacked at once. In 2012 there were 4 or 5 batteries, I think know there are about 10 and more are being added. There is also much more support for the "Iron Beam" proposal which would stop short range mortars.   yet the reality we found out after the fact was that is worked less tahn 10% of the time.  And Israelis', who were the ones who were supposedly protected by it, knew during the conflict that it wasn't working. Just like they know now the Iron Dome is working.  you gotta open your mind and ears.  Fine, point me to the best. Your argument currently comes down to "wake up sheeple!"   Your argument would hold water if you were talking about not developing it in the first place because of the cost. You're saying this:  yes that's the problem...what people "~~see~~ want" and the reality it's used for are quite often different.  We can see what Iron Dome is doing *right now.*  look at the patriot act - after 9/11 every single person was gung ho for it because it seemed like it's protectingus.  now? it's the most unpatriotic thing and a tool for all of the recent NSA abuses.  And people warned about that when it was passed. This is a weapons system, not a law or planned war. Your analogies are awful.    The evidence for this is that only 22 people have died in over 15,000 rocket attacks over a decade.  This is where you analysis absolutely fails. Yes, people have died in roughly the same numbers because of other security measures, **but injuries and damages** are massively down. That is not pure chance.  you are raging so hard you didn't realize the 10% figure is the number of the effectiveness of the Patriot system. The same system that the US claimed is 90% effective...similarly to how Israel claims the Iron Dome is effective.  we won't know til later - like we found out about the patriot system.  Except Israelis knew during the Gulf War that the patriot system wasn't working by looking out their windows, just like they know the opposite now.     That was the argument as to why not develop it in the first place. But the vast majority of the cost was paid in development and now it is working extremely well and people feel much safer, so no. It is actually a kind of celebrity.   I would more compare it to stopping a sexual assault, but whatever floats your boat! :P  I'm not here to argue with shitheads online, but to refute them so that other people reading are more informed. Trying to change posters' opinions here is useless.   now I understand why the bias and selective processing of information  Now you know why people like Iron Dome so much. It is not statistics released by the IDF, but what people see.   Mind if I copy paste this into my analysis above so we have a coordinated rebuttal?   I save my downvotes for Hams supporters on worldnews. Why I go there is still a mystery...   Israel doesn't have an military-industrial complex like America has, so the comparison to the patriot missile is bullshit.   I agree. Take a look at the democracynow discussion. Guy makes some incredibly good points.   What are his best points? I can't see any very good ones?   This is an edited letter I sent to a news publication earlier to show why the 5% figure is complete bullshit:  I can definitely state that Iron Dome's intercept rate is over 5%.   **Statistics and Analysis**  First, his analysis is not new and is mainly based on Operation Pillar of Defense in 2012, not the most recent conflict, and was done using civilian photographs. (Weirdly, I can't find the original analysis itself, only reports of it.) It is not clear in yours or other articles whether he is stating that only 5% of total rockets, or 5% of rockets that Iron Dome fires at, are intercepted. A clarification would be nice in that respect, since the IDF only fires the Iron Dome when the missiles are headed to a built up area, since it are so expensive to use.  [Here is Ha'aretz on the 2012 analysis.](http://www.haaretz.com/opinion/how-many-rockets-has-iron-dome-really-intercepted.premium-1.508277 ) Two articles([1](http://www.technologyreview.com/news/528916/israeli-rocket-defense-system-is-failing-at-crucial-task-expert-analysts-say/ ), [2](http://www.technologyreview.com/view/528991/an-explanation-of-the-evidence-of-weaknesses-in-the-iron-dome-defense-system/ )) in the MIT technology review have been published about this. I believe the article you linked to is based on the second:  [Here are the latest IDF statistics](http://www.idfblog.com/blog/2014/08/05/operation-protective-edge-numbers/ ) of rockets fired at Israel (note: as of 8/05):  * 3,360 rockets fired  * 2,303 hit Israel (70%) * 475 hit gaza (14%)  * 584 intercepted by Iron dome (17%)  If the IDF claims an 80% success rate of Iron Dome, that means:  * they fired at about 730 (22% of total rockets) * and missed 150 (5% of total rockets)  * Most of the 2000+ rockets that did hit would have hit open areas, but not all.  5% effectiveness related to total rockets would be 150 intercepted, which is 20% attempted interceptions, nothing to sneeze at though still not great. 5% of attempted interceptions would be only about 40 rockets. Which is it?  **Refutation**  Second, His analysis is pretty easy to refute, not by looking at grainy images, but by looking at warnings, damages, and casualties. There have been over 30 sirens in the Tel Aviv area; unlike your article states, most of it is apartment buildings or high rises, not open space. (If you want to see a city with open space, go to Be'ersheva.) As far as I can tell, and I have been following updates closely, there have not been one rocket reported to actually hit the area. How is this possible if Iron Dome only intercepts 5% of the rockets it launches at? The expensive, Iranian made Fajr-5 missiles actually use a targeting system and would be aimed toward civilian populations.  And the places further south (Kiryat Melachi, Ashdod, Ashkelon, etc.) seem to have much less damage than they did in the 2008 war. You're the reporter, not me, so this is something you can research, but my impressions were that it was unsafe to at all live in those areas during that war, and there was a lot of destruction. This year, there have been very few reports of damages, while I remember almost every day I heard about rocket damage in 2008 and 2012.  During this operation there have been only **3 civilian deaths and 22 injuries** (according to the IDFblog which seems to have stopped updating in mid-July, but I can't imagine that it is more than 50 injuries) while in 2008, according to Wikipedia, **600+ were injured** (4,000 rocket attacks) and in 2012 it was **almost 300** (3,000 rocket attacks). This is another place your analysis and/or the professor's fails; yes, the deaths are about the same, but as he says deaths are unlikely anyway. However, injuries and damages are dramatically down while rockets, and more targeted and damaging rockets, are up. This would make no sense if Iron Dome wasn't working.   *TL;DR A 10-20 fold decrease in injuries, and massively reduced reports of damages, is absurd if Iron Dome wasn't successful.*  **Feeling of Security**  Furthermore, anyone on the ground can tell you there is a large difference between this war and 2008. There is a different sound if a rocket hits the ground, a rocket explodes on the ground, or an Iron Dome intercepts a rocket. There have been multiple reports of shrapnel falling from destroyed rockets. People feel much safer because they notice my points above. **Iron Dome is not a celebrity in Israel because people see it shooting and the IDF publishes statistics, but because they can see that the destruction from Hamas is severely limited now that it has been deployed all across the south.**  **Conspiracy**  Final point: It would require an incredible conspiracy to cover all of this up (/r/conspiracy levels!). There are lots of people working or have worked on Iron Dome, and they would have to prevent anyone from speaking about its failure. If there has been damages from rockets hitting buildings, like the one that killed 3 in 2012, it would need to be covered up. If there were no rockets fired at the Tel Aviv area, the only other conclusion from my above analysis, then fake Red Alert sirens would have to be ordered and then covered up. None of these are plausible.  Is it possible the IDF is exaggerating somewhat? Possibly. But nothing on the order of a 5% of claimed interceptions or of total rockets. We would be seeing entirely different results on the ground if that was the case.  Edit: Your points are addressed above as well, but to show specifically why you are wrong:  it has more to do with the crude and shitty rockets being used than the Iron Dome.  Then why are damages and injuries down so much if Iron Dome wasn't working?   Also, the thing that keeps Israelis safest isn't the Iron Dome - it's the incredibly effective and well deployed early warning system that allows people to find cover quickly  Absolutely. But even with this system over 600 people were injured in 2008, and we are seeing nothing on that level today. Statistics of damages are much harder to find, but it seems to be a lot less as well.  Studies have shown that even a 5 second warning, allowing someone to lie/duck down and cover, increases surivability by 60%+ Makes sense if you think about the explosion and trajectory of debris.  **Survivability =/ Injuries.** Yes, they might survive, but could still be moderately or severely injured. Your analysis doesn't explain the discrepancy.     From what I've read, it's mostly three and four. There are already 3 potential interceptors fired from each battery before the rocket hits the ground, and each interceptor costs $20,000 to fire.     He hasn't been following the news. The 90%+ figure was only at the start of this conflict.   So you should support Al-Qaeda and not Hamas!   This article was published today and the Jerusalem post is a pretty major news source.   Everyone remember this: Hamas first says one thing to the west and then another thing to their supporters. The same will come out about the death count in Gaza once everyone has stopped paying attention; innocent civilians will magically transform into heroic martyrs who fought to the death.   Is there any statement in American law which says the purpose of American citizens is to follow those laws?   Ok, now I'm just confused what your response has to do with my original comments...   Operation Protective Edge is not Operation Brother's Keeper, and both occurred with provocations, not randomly.   Yep, just correcting because these kinds of misconceptions can be easily propagated, as the history of christianity shows.    The kitzur's issue with flames not being at the same height (and the Ah"S would probably agree) is the latter.   Except aren't these requirements still valid whether or not a shamash is present? This seems to indicate that the problem addressed is showing that the 8 as one unit but still distinct from one another, not that they are a unit which are separate from the shamash.     Also, KJV, not JKV.  Thanks.  The simple fact that a significant portion of rabbinic texts are written in Aramaic and are, in many cases, considered more authoritative than the original text of the Hebrew Bible itself undercuts the notion that Hebrew was the authoritative language.  Yes, all true. But you said: the only accepted version of the Qur'an is one that is in Arabic, whereas this is not the case with the Hebrew Bible  scriptural texts written in English...are all just as authoritative as the original languages  This is what I am disputing, not that there are many texts written in other languages in Jewish and halachic literature. You are giving the impression that the **translation** of a Hebrew Bible into English, or a Talmud into the same, is as authoritative as the original text.     Are either of these two things incorrect? Jewish converts to Christianity are not expected to follow the Torah, and from a Jewish viewpoint worshipping Jesus is idolatry.    Yes, but it is an addendum and not part of the requirement. It reads like this:  Do not follow a man who leads you astray by telling you to worship other Gods, even if he performs miracles, for God is testing you by sending him.   Yes? All 8 candles must be recognizable as being lit together -- but the shamash must be separate so as not to be confused, which I see as the biggest problem here. Neither of your sources here seem to address that.   Just so that there is no bad blood between us, I never downvoted you.   From what I have learned, it is the commonly held belief in Rabbinic Judaism after the fall of the second Temple. Even among the modern, liberal streams of Judaism translations are much more acceptable but not authoritative, especially compared to how the JKV is treated among many Christian sects. Do you have a source that says otherwise?    If that's true provide a reference for it.  Start with [this wikipedia page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christianity_and_antisemitism). Click on the links on top of the subsections for expanded explanations. This is all burned into the Jewish collective memory.  Reference?  See the link above, specifically the arguments among early church fathers and the Spanish Inquisition. If you want to read more on the latter, google conversos, crypto-Jews, and marranos.   Considered them backward? I thought they were tortured and killed? (Really, can you source any of this?)  Augustine is the most commonly given example. Again, read the opinions of early church fathers on Jews and Judaism.   Oh, I do that too. I mean that when the problem continues afterwards and they continue to complain without doing anything.   three months is "right after" now? Who knew!   Of course, I meant that the shamash flame must be different in some way from all of the others.    For many Christians and Jews, scriptural texts written in English (or French, or German, or Swahili, what have you) are all just as authoritative as the original languages.   I do not believe that this is true in Judaism. The original language is always the best, as far as I have seen.   Would it be possible to delete the old bigoted posts?    Go talk shit about israel  Yeah, this might be the problem. Criticizing and talking shit are two different things.    we are held to a higher standard than the believers of the OT  How is not following the law being held to a higher standard?    In other words, jews follow the letter of the law and christian follow the spirit of the law.  The spirit of the Law is quite clearly to follow the letter of the law, which christians don't do.    The person would be considered raised as a captive. That means that he would be breaking commandments (which is based on actions, not intentions) but would not be held as liable for what he did.   I meant that just because someone in Gaza tweets something expressing sympathy of someone in America does not mean that Hamas doesn't want to kill them.    Peter didn't do either of these two things. Or if he did, she me where (again, chapter and verse).   1. The Church, which is based on Peter's teachings, told Jews to not follow the Law.  2. Peter and the Church both told Jews to follow other gods (Jesus).   Fits pretty well.    For very good reasons.   such as, that there were foods that "defiled a man", in the sense that they, of themselves, had the power of making someone unclean.  Why do you think that Jews ever taught this?   I said above that Peter never instructed any Torah observant Jews to disobey one iota of Torah. Nor did I suggest anywhere that Jesus told any of his Jewish followers to disregard Torah.  Except it is your church that has multiple times, over the past 2000 years, given Jews living in its lands two options: convert or die. And if converted, they could not keep the old laws under pain of torture and death. Even when they were suffered to live, the Church considered them backwards for keeping the Law that God enjoined upon them, and celebrated converts from Judaism (who, incidentally, were not required to keep the Law).      Jews were used to seeing Gentiles as "unclean", like dogs  Why do you think this is true?  These cleanliness laws, as well as circumcision, built up a "wall of separation" between Israel and "the Nations".  Why did God make a law, which he called eternal, only to tear it down a few years later?    *Christianity* doesn't make sense. Don't tar all religions with the same brush, though.   Correction: A false prophet is someone who causes people to transgress by claiming that he is receiving a divine message. Performing miracles is not part of the criteria. The Torah just says that miracles should be irrelevant to the message.   There are only two things God created that can be classified as evil: death and free will. Just because God created them doesn't mean he cannot be good.   I guess hit on = attempted rape now...   From what I learned in high school, the most important thing (edit: in this case) is that the Shamash is distinct. Both could work if you place a visibly different candle in the shamash holder, I think.   Then can you also explain why women *do* it? "Venting" without wanting a solution, ever. Sympathy without a solution, like the person above said.   Send a few "summary" paragraphs and ask him out on a date. Otherwise it's a little bit too much in the beginning. Use the rest to guide how you would like to express your feelings in person.   Could you list/link to all the army ranks in Hebrew with the english equivalents?    You mean the one that the US took over through an aggressive war less than 200 years ago? Mexico has a right to that land!    They'll be faulted regardless of what they do.   Hamas =/ individual Palestinians   Many of the alleged conspirators are Hamas members who were released as part of the Shalit deal and then rearrested. These are the same people that Hamas is demanding be set free as part of the ceasefire negotiations.  I wonder how this will change the Hamas-PA unity pact which has still been technically in effect throughout this war?      From a previous point of mine about why Isaiah 53 is clearly about Israel:  Isaiah 53 is very clearly talking about the Children of Israel, though it is obscured by the way Christians separated the chapters. If you look at 52: 13-15 (which is the same section that starts with chapter 50), you can see that the prophet introduces a "servant" in third person. 13 says that the servant will be exalted, 14 that (in past tense) "marred beyond man is his appearance," 15 that (in future tense) how kings and nations will react.  Then, in 53:1, the narrative shifts to the perspective of those kings and nations, who are talking about the servant after he has risen and exalted. In the past, "he had not form," "he was despised," etc. But now "He has grown," "he might see offspring," etc. Then in the second half of verse 11 the narrative shift back to prophet, who describes the servant a bit more.  Now how is it possible that, during the time the prophet was speaking, Jesus was already marred, and that nations were appalled (did this ever happen?). Only in the future will the nations say "As one who hid his face from us, he was despised, we held him to no account." Did they ever say this about Jesus? On the other hand, (the house of) Israel fulfills all of this! In context with chapters 52 and 54, if one is a believer, one could see the prophecy be fulfilled today. If you read the entire section, chapter 53 is actually the pivot between a mourning Israel/Jerusalem and a joyous one, it makes sense why Israel would be referred as a "suffering servant" here.   Me? No. Do some commentators? Yes.   Judaism's view: It's a debate whether it was slight of hand or actual magic.    Do you want me to go through these and show that each and every one is, to quote from above, "not a prophecy at all, not a messianic prophecy, or taken so far out of context that it's purported to mean the opposite of what it actually means?"   How is this the letter of the law? Sabbath mode just disables the electronic displays and auto turn off. It's the exact same thing as having a constant fire going.   It'd be like saying that we can worship other Gods now  Funny thing us, that is what was done with Jesus and all afterwards.   What's interesting is that the symptoms described by galphanore are very similar to the real ones after fasting/long term malnourishment. But the latter are a lot more...insidious, I guess?   It's too goddamn long and not much happens.  	109
 Oh,thanks, I fixed it.        	3
                                        I'm pretty happy with my build right now, and I want to create it again in the next league. Is there a way to keep a snapshot of it for future reference without fearing the next tree will break the paths?                                     I always create a group before going into maps (i farm masters, so I want to share it PA) - the group is created **public**. I cannot change it to private until someone joins. Why is that? it doesn't make sense.   Also, when the last person (besides me) leaves or even if I kick the last person - the group closes (sometimes it doesn't, I haven't figured out when) and I need to create a new one. Why is that?   I should be able to create a perma private group.                  And 7+ masters should spawn rare areas (up to 6 mods).         I'm trying to use life formula to match my actual number, and I'm coming short.   According to the wiki:       Life = (38 + (Level * 12) + (Strength / 2) + additive modifiers) * (100% + multiplicative modifiers)  On the gear I have +288 life and +36% to max life (Belly of the Beast). Per PoEBuilder I have +20/+138% from the tree.  So the calculation coming up as:      Life = (38 + (86 * 12) + (213 / 2) + 20 + 288) * (100% +36% + 138%) =   4067  My life is just over 4200, so where am I missing 200 HP?                Preferably wrapped up in a GroupBox. Any hints and ideas? Thanks. (PS reading the files isn't the issue here, just the dynamically adding buttons inside a groupbox)  Update. Okay so basically I create those 2 functions, and I think it will work for me (the variables are self explanatory - x,y,w,h and some margins in between):       add_group(group_number, group_name)     {      global      group_y := (group_number - 1) * group_h + 10       Gui, Add, GroupBox, xm ym+%group_y%  Section w%group_w% h%group_h% , %group_name%     }      add_button_to_group(sub_name, caption, is_first=false)     {      global      if (is_first)      {       Gui, Add, Button,  xs+%gui_m%    ys+%gui_m% w%gui_w%  h30 g%sub_name% , %caption%      }      else      {       Gui, Add, Button,  xp+%gui_w_margin%  ys+%gui_m% w%gui_w%  h30 g%sub_name% , %caption%      }     }  To use it, I simply call:      add_group(1,"Shortcuts #1")      add_button_to_group("RunSomething1", "Name #1", true)      add_group(2,"Shortcuts #2")     add_button_to_group("RunSomething2", "Name #2", true)     add_button_to_group("RunSomething3", "Name #3" )                                                                                              Or do I need to scan my gear one by one?                              When I purchase a decoration I see, for example, 11 Variations (Crypt Tomb). What does it mean? how do I get more variations? is it just between masters?                   I used Flesh Offering in my previous two summoners, and I wad wondering about switching to BO. My question is, do attack and spell block really boost the minions' survivability, especially against AOE bosses?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    I just downloaded it and gave it a try, the things I'm missing are:  * Is there a slideshow mode? in BaconReader I can view the post full screen (image, webpage, etc) and then slide right to the next one. Very convenient for image focused subs. Couldn't find this option here. *  When clicking on a post on the front page, I get directly to the post content. Is there a way to get directly to the comments (skipping the slide up part)? * Is there a way to collapse all comments by default? * I have some subs I view often, but I don't want to subscribe to them. So I added them manually without subscribing, that's cool - just like BR. However when I sync my subs, the new ones were deleted. Is it a bug?  Thanks. The app looks great.                  	200
    I can only speak for myself, but I think the graphic novels are **superb**. Not much differs from the novellas in regards of the text. Though I am not an expert.    Patience my dear Padawan. It will all come. So long as HBO doesn't fuck up the rights, or sell them to Warner we are all good.   You are keeping a good pace! My tip is don't rush. There are vital information on almost every page, and you only got one chance to read the books for the first time.    They had Dragonstone for a long time before moving there. It was the westernmost outpost of the Valyrians.    The Golden Company started as Blackfyre loyalists.    Casualness, casualness, casualness.   No it's more the setting of Bloodraven. He should have one eye with roots digging into his very flesh. He just sat there like a regular dude.    Also Doctor Who is pretty overwhelming when it comes to brittish guest actors.   **EDIT  Game of Thrones / Doctor Who Crossover edition**  Tobias Menzies and Liam Cunningham as mention by *sbutler87*  Joe Dempsie - Gendry  Harry Lloyd (Viserys)  Mark Gatniss (duh.)  David Bradley (Walder Frey) is in Doctor Who and also plays William Hartnell (#1 Doctor) in the movie "An Adventure of Space and Time".   Iain Glenn (Jorah the Andal)  Thomas Brodie-Sangster - Jojen  Diana Rigg (Queen of Thorns)  Julian Glover - Pycelle  Jamie Sives, Ron Donachie and Ian Hanmore was all in the same episode "Tooth and Claw".  Lucian Msamati - Salladhor Saan  Mark Killeen (Mero, Captain of the Second Sons)  Spencer Wilding - A White Walker who has played several aliens in Doctor Who  Tim Plester - Black Walder Rivers  Finn Jones (Loras Tyrell) was in the spin-off The Sarah Jane Adventures  Burn Gorman (Karl Tanner) and Owen Teale (Alliser Thorne) was in the spin-off Torchwood   Donald Sumpter (Maester Luwin) and Julian Glover was in the old Who-series  **'t'was a lot more than I realized.**    Benjen is the Nights King confirmed   Rhaegar?     yes, partially.   *"Unreliable Narrator"* is GRRM's explanation that describes the whole "Wylla scenario" The name of the series "A Song of ice and Fire" should add some thought.    Nice thought. Could be they travel past it, and we get a bit of history.   Brynden Rivers is Ravenclaw   Dunk is Hufflepuff     The thought as come across my mind as well.    Thanks!    YES. But make sure to get A Feast for Crows expansion as well. Vanilla with less than 6 players is a bit broken, but the exp-pack makes the game a 4-player objective based game that doesn't take 6+ hours.   The Lady of the Vale will probably open her arms wide when Dany arrives through I would think. It was to Aegon and his dragons Torrhen Stark bent his knee. I think Sansa will remember that.   I wonder if they are preparing people to see Game of Thrones at the cinema.. 6 seasons and a movie, anyone?   There is also the sun Daenerys remembers. The sun rarely shines in Braavos.  You should read the Luke and Leia post if you are interested in the theory. I quite like it, although we *have to wait and see*   He hasn't lied about his unfaithfulness because he refuse to speak about them as to make any more lies. I think R+L=J is solid. Totally fits the title of the book. What I don't know is The frickin' lemon tree. There are plenty in Dorne, but none known in Braavos. Rain and Fog doesn't give lemontrees a chance.  But if Daenerys was born in Dorne? Is she the daughter of Aerys? Viserys was a miracle after millions of miscarriages (10?) The whole Luke and Leia post really got me thinking.. I think I will make another as to put fire on the discussion.   I watched John Oliver on net neutrality. And he got me thinking. Internet Providers basically has us in our grips.  I will provide a personal example which I hope others will too.  Watch the very informative John Oliver explain it here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpbOEoRrHyU   nbsp; **In Sweden**, where I don't think it is as bad as in the US, the status quo is:  *-* 3 or 4 big providers for countryside and suburbs.    *-* Around two more advanced providers additionally avalible in larger cities.  My sister lives three blocks from me in a smaller city, separated by a main road. I have access to one of the big ones exclusively, and she has access to the other two.  The one I've got also has cheaper service in student-apartments.   nbsp;  If one could gather information on avalability you could possibly prove that they have areas of control for reduced competition and therefore possibly *illegal(?)* monopoly on the market.   I'd take some *Unsullied*, Dothraki riders and freed slaves for archers, grab an Ironborn fleet that is cruisin' nearby and go straight for The Vale of Arryn.   Conquer it in a couple of days with my 3 dragons. And then I'd have an inconquerable stronghold from which I send letters saying "Bend the knee, or I will fry you like bacon. **Burnt black.**   *But hey, why not chill in a pyramid?*   You should call HBO or GRRM's marketing guys. Use the interwebz to find a number somewhere.    Upvote for flair, but well. This is old news on this sub I would say t'was the redditor Honey-something who discovered the Benjen stuff.  **How much Anne Groell knows about where George is in his process has been disputed by the Maesters for centuries.**    I like your spirit. *But we'll have to wait and see!*   Dunk of course..      Want to fit this into my own tinfoil of Bran warging Dunk with the help of Bloodraven.   Sworn Sword: "It was if some God put the words in my mouth"   Remember how Bran desperately wanted to be a Knight and is told he never will be.   Well, as it happens Dunk isn't a Knight, and still is the most chivalrous Knight in Westeros?     Jaime is going to the Riverlands in the end of the seasons though right?    http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0265610/  Her schedule seems a little light, am I right?  One movie completed and a tv series that I don't think have been shooting this fall if I am reading the air-dates correctly.   She is born in Ireland, so she would have reason to be basically on location.. **I have hope**, but I am ready for a dissappointing surprise.   Well. if R+L=J, Aegon i fakeon then J = the rightful heir to the Iron Throne, since he is the last male heir to the throne.     That would be ironical considering how Ned's oldest son does exactly the opposite and well..   That's how I first interpreted it. Now I don't really know. it feels like some old gods magic to me but.. well it's in my titles.   Really like this theory.  *But we will have to wait and see!*   average would be average health.    You'll have to wait and see.   The dragon must have three heads. Daenerys eggs,  Lyanna's crypt and Aegon with greyscale?  Sure, *but you'll have to wait and see!*    The significance here I would say lies in that you could identify another Warg?    The big three. D or J i would guess.    Got mit uns!    I feel that Bran is not so bad in the books? His chapters are like magic,  magic, magic. Awesome magic.  Show Bran is whiney as hell.    Worth noting is that the English version will be **heavily** illustrated. The ones released in other languages this year will not be..    AFFC is slow. It picks up but not to the extent of ASOS.   I got the black one! Just had to say that.   Yeah, visiting Gibraltar Casterly Rock was all I thought about.  That and the Neanderthals.   April 1st right?   Maybe! You'll have to wait and see.   Coldhands = Brandon the Builder confirmed?    Maybe the best casting of season 1?   I hate that the door seeminly have been painted white :(   I think CH is an old (old) dude. First Men for sure. Maybe a Stark, maybe just nobody. (But probably a Stark)   That TES V: Skyrim was a bit influenced by A Song of Ice and Fire is certain. Dragons, The Northerners rebel against the kingdom (empire). Riften is basically Braavos and Windhelm and Winterhold makes me think of Winterfell.  Oh, and Draugers..  But I came to thinking about TES IV: Oblivion, and Brother Martin is the **illegitimate son of Emperor Uriel Septim VII**, and the last remaining of that ancient bloodline. In the beginning of the game, he is sworn as a munk. At the end, he turns into a dragon.  Am I grasping for air, or is The Elder Scrools very influenced by A Song of Ice and Fire? **Bethesda was almost about to make a licensed Game of Thrones!**  http://www.vg247.com/2011/09/15/bethesda-why-we-turned-down-a-game-of-thrones/      I do not think they hold a finished novel in ASOIAF. They want that out ASAP. George could be sharing information with his publisher though. It's just the readers frustration he is tired of, right?   Why not. We have nothing better to do than wondering about how potatoes got to Westeros anyway.  New editions for A Song of Ice and Fire are releasing in October this year. Which could very well be Harper Voyagers way of cashing in inbetween the wait for the next big payday.  But I always keep a good look on GRRM's website. Particulary the tour-dates. http://www.georgerrmartin.com/appearances/ The next big convention is The Pacific Northwests Science-Fiction Fantasy Convention which almost coincides with the Season 5 premier date. And after that if follows with Fantasy conventions all year long.  **Let's speculate** Our dream would come true if GRRM announces this April with a summer/autumn release.   My more modest but still falthering hope is we have the book by Spring 2016, before season 6 starts.   Maybe it's 6 books?  *The Winds of Winter Confirmed*?     God I would hate this. And I have nightmares about it happening. **It happend to Half Life 2.**   She was young, madly in love and probably naive as well.     "I'm gonna give you a clout on the ear". **so hard you'll fly across the lake."**  SearchDE! "clout"   Gave my10 YO nephew KSP for christmas. He love building planes. Well. Even I can't build functional planes, but he loads in a stock one, and mods them. Finding out what works and what don't.   Children are awesome. Trial and Error has made him capable of landing and starting again. I have high hopes for him being the first astronaut visiting Europa. ;)   This is the kind of post that makes me and my accomplishments in this game feel so small.   I don't understand these kinds of threads.  Not saying you can't wonder, but I don't see what's interesting about Westeros having food that originated from the Americas. **There is a wall made of ice, 700 feet high for christ sake.** Let them have their lemon cakes and potatoes.   I suspect he will be Bran's tool. Broking a peace between the Others and Westeros.  Or he will frikkin' kill all the Others with his burning sword.   Kings who ate, drank and fucked around is not something new. I am sure he based King Robert Baratheon on some of the old kings in history who has been known to have a few similar traits as 'Ole Bobby B   Well. Benjen should be a candidate?  Maybe TreeBran aswell?   'Ofttimes a very small man can cast a very large shadow.   Simplifying. Simplifying. Simplifying... HBO fears viewers will go away from that episode wondering "Well, who the hell is Cat?"   **I think distrusting viewer's intelligence is the greatest crime of television writing today.**   Later Dunk sends the smallfolk home, defying Ser Eustace and Ser Bennis.. *"It was if some god had put the words in my mouth. Not the warrior"*..  Bred my theory of Bran influencing Dunk. The Castle Wall through weirnet  somehow. Maybe because he is Hodor's grandgrandfather or something. **"He knew every stone of that wall".**   I feel what you write could be true, but not relevant to the story.  It could just as easy be an homage to Tokiens's "The Undying Lands" which lies west of Middle Earth.   Em-Com would even be right :)   Regrettably no.. I needed to fly past Ike for a science contract and this came up. It was easily corrected but I felt like sharing it because it looks kind of hilarious.      You have to read up on the **R+L=J** "theory". There are so much foreshadowing for that theory it is generally regarded as a known fact.   HBO makes Dunk and Egg mini series with 3 episodes   Robert was the heir to his house, Baratheons are known to be proud. Ned was a second son of the quiet house Stark.   Wow Thanks guys, exactly what I'm looking for!    I must first say. I suck at building spaceplanes. I have watched Scott Manley building but it is really hard.  I bit into Career into beta, ship costs are really expensiv. So a cheap reusable ship to carry loads for stations and such would be really handy.  I wonder if anyone here have a good build with stock parts for a shuttle taking of vertically or horizontally with high cargo capability or wants to create one for this purpose would be a Kerbal King.  If it looks like one of Nasa's Shuttles. Bonus points!   Volantis is close to Valyria. Well relatively. They have a lot of experience about the waters thereabouts and know any ship going to Valyria won't return. They knew Tommen II was going to die in Valyria, so they followed him and stole all he had and killed them?  Why not! :D   Ordered the book 1-4 moments after seeing episode 10 of season 1. so I knew everything there.  When I had read aFfC I was depressed, but happily realized book 5 had just been released!    Oh my. Are we having **another** rebellion? You must be kidding me.   As an honourable man of the North he felt he could be useful at the Wall. You must remember The North look at serving in the Watch as a great deed. Jorah could handle Bear Island (well)..   Yes, and that's what she would say should she be in the next season.  http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0265610/  Her schedule is pretty empty, she might appear. I won't be surprised if they cut her though.   Yeah. screw Brienne right?   His blog is down? tWoW release for christmas 2014 confirmed !   ** can see why people downvote you to hell...** Should actors have been contacted a script would be done. Then we would have producers already working on it and somewhere along the way it would have leaked.  You will be considered a troll making such statements without a source. And don't say it's because you can't say anything else. This is the internet, not the streets of North Korea.   I too have vague memory of HBO owning all rights... :(   I think you may be right. Bloodraven is in them though, and Maester Aemon could easily be made fit to make a cameo in the beginning to gather interest. **And I think with the proper title and a "pilot" with many references to characters and events we heard of**, HBO could make people interested in Dunk   Egg.   **Any suggestions**?  "A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms" is actually pretty good.  "A True Knight of Westeros" would be more eyecatching.   Sweet summer child. GRRM had the whole story fleshed out in 1995.. It has nothing to do with that. It is the dialogues, the foreshadowing and the subtle hints in every other paragraph that makes these book take so fucking long a time to write. That and the 1500 pages of manuscript each one consist of...   Agree on Robert's rebellion.  However I don't feel Dunk and Egg is quite epic enough to make it to the big screen. It's still good drama though with a good climax in each story. As I mentioned in the OP, BBC's Sherlock has a quite fitting way of doing it. With 3 episodes per year each 1 and a half hour in length.   It could be awesome considering each novella is a separate story still connected to the other two.   I am so glad you shared this life changing revelation! It invites to a lengthy discussion indeed!    Well. I don't know how to answer that without offending you.   Good point. We would get to see how Rhaegar fought nobly and get to know the Targaryen family first hand before diving in to the great history.   I would like to see the conquest, dance of dragons and blackfyre rebellions made with the budgets they deserve. Because even though the series-format makes for a dramaturgically better story I can't help to believe the lower budgets that comes with it would basically massacre some of the grander events visually.       Barely nothing word by word. But he wrote the whole Targaryen history, too long to be in the book. Elio and Linda shortened it down. Georges version will be published later as a complete history of the Targaryens.   Foreshadowing for revenge of some sort I would say! Bran will remember the whole history of Westeros and most likely the whole world, so I doubt I is in regards to that.    Wasn't it steel that came with the Andals?  I feel the first men came with bronze as their main metal, but had discovered iron by the time of the long night, what 4000 years later?   And the others aren't vulnerable to iron. They just hate it as it is an object crafted by man.  At least that is how I perceive it.    He replied to a comment on his blog once. That's it and I don't see why it's a big deal.   You sweet summer child. You know nothing of fear.   E-LL-I-O-T?   They said it to boost sales. Really lame. He wrote it 10 years prior to ASOIAF. it can't be set in westeros, because 1981 Westeros didn't exist.   I really think Alfie Allen has portrayed Reek so extremely good. He was an ok Theon. But he really is Reek.  I just want him reeling about and rhyme a lot on his name next season and I will be fully satisfied.   I consider it an "in-universe history". Most historical things are correct, but description of events crucial for ASOIAF are false or missing.  I got it for christmas (waiting was really hard). And I have read some small portions about the Dawn age and some of the Targ kings. And I must say, though it is exceptionally interesting. The Art is really what blew my mind. Dunk vs The Laughing Storm made my jaw drop.   **I really (really) hope HBO makes Dunk and Egg into a series. Maybe like Sherlock, with 3 episodes each year about 1 and a half hour in length."** That would make 3 seasons.  HBO should prepare for such a series in the Show with Bran somehow. Just hinting at it with something to make the stories intertwine a bit.   same here..  	105

 Huh?  What advantage could netflix have by asking this question?  It'd obviously have more against it than for it.     I asked because they were talking about it on the "news" today.     I like that "netflix free" idea.    Would be nice to be able to catch their series for free with ads.  It might actually drive people to sign up for ad free subscription.        With the exception of Everquest, Runescape is probably the biggest old title game around right now.      You're a superhero; but would you feel cooler if your last name were West?     FPH: Fucking People Heavywhere.      Stay off of INTERNET personals everybody.     FTFY     It's subjective.   So you don't advocate a gun on every mans hip like in the old west?  I've heard the argument (and I don't know that this is true) that hollywood gunfights didn't happen that much in the old west because every man was armed.  The "mutual assured destruction" argument. I guess.    I have slow internet in the philippines but I'm only seeing a couple  of real big gun battles in searching. Like Kansas city and tombstone.  Tombstone's gun battle is actually overstated a lot.    So I guess in early search I can kind of substantiate that claim.  We certainly didn't have near the deaths we are currently having.... for whatever, probably multiple, reasons.     That's patented tho.... so it really doesn't matter if the original is still there.     That's how companies get protected from scammers making a copycat iphone.   The whole reason for the patent system is so that peoples shit doesn't get stolen.   Yes but does his exective power extend to unilaterally changing drug classifications?  I thought it was congress that had to do that.      "Remember to play in the street all day, Kids!"     I'd be such a good dad.   That's true.   But saying "white people are superior" isn't really threatening or terroristic as "lets hang all black people".       The later is a direct threat of actually harming another, whilst the former is just uttered nonsense that we should point and laugh at in a shaming manner.     One is the very definition of a "terroristic threat".   The other is not and could never be construed as such legally.     Public shaming works.... to a degree.  Until you drive them all together and underground.   Then once they are excluded by society, they have no reason to follow that society's rules.    So in a way, you shrink the size of the groups but in being cornered they lash out more.     That's a whole different can of worms.     I would most certainly feel threatened if I were black and whites were running around saying they were "superior".... but probably not as worried as if the whites started saying "lets kill everyone who's not white".    Edit: Bananas and touchscreens    Try reading.  He's in one thread defending stealing.  Then he's in this thread arguing the opposite.   I suspect you're his alt.    It's good.  I read it all.   It was informative without being a long say nothing word salad.   Thanks for all the info.  You've given me a lot to chew on for a while.     Hard to cut through the hysteria when the topics of guns comes up.   So it's hard to really allow opinions to evolve in that environment.      Does Obama have that power?   Yeah... no Asian immigrants is how our railroads were built. /s   Until reading your post I have been against the electoral college.   Kudos on the CMV on that.   Only if they engage in violence or threats....    but at its core states rights was always about the right of slavery.   What????    No.... States rights has been used to defend slavery but that doesn't mean that's it's sole purpose; which is to keep the federal government from micromanaging states.   So chill with the dogma...   Yeah I'm a bit on the fence with that.  I do know that we don't need assault rifles with huge magazines on the street. Weapons of war have no business flooding the streets.   But like you pointed out there is no way of undoing that without forcefully stripping people of them.  Which is more wrong than having them in my mind.   At least mandatory training and safety classes would be nice.   I think I might have not communicated correctly.  I mean if we did not infringe on our rights to own weapons then there would be non such thing as illegal sales. Because every single sale would be legal no matter what.     It's both sort of.   This is how violent criminals get their hands on so many unregistered firearms.   It sort of fuels the black market.  Edit:  although there would be no need for a black market if we just stopped restrictions on gun purchases in every state.       Thanks!   Wyoming says fuck you.

During the summer we would coil individual vines around stakes and lay them on a ruler.   You can literally see it moving slowly... like watching a shadow move from the sun.     Whoevers vine grew the most won the bet.      What is the gun per capita number for each state?      AZ doesn't pay any mind to the casuals of other states.   "You can't sing worth a heck with a big hole in your neck... no you don't always die from tobacco."    On a side note, I like how it was supposed to show you can't sing by using a catchy song.   It's not about the ashtray.... it's about winning the fight.   I'm just saying if it's not on Netflix or hulu why would I sign up for a third temporary service just to watch it.     Just make the content available... then I might have been enticed to watch it on TV for the current season.    The point is,  with all the other available content, Imy not going to go out of my way to watch something that takes going through a signup and cancellation of service process.  They killed themselves.  That's not my fault, that's their's for choosing to limit the size of the audience their content reaches.   It's like putting ice cream shop at the top of a long flight of stairs whilst 2 other ice cream shops are already positioned at the bottom.  Unless your product is immensely better and your prices lower, few are going to take the extra trip to visit you.

Have fun getting your door kicked in for stealing copyright material because you were too cheap to pay for it.   [Umm you were just in another thread making excuses for stealing the content.](https://www.reddit.com/r/television/comments/3ar4ap/nbc_has_canceled_hannibal/csfbfy7)   Yeah. Wtf is he talking about the selection is bad?   Sure some of it his lower budget on average but as we've seen recently, simply throwing a ton of money at a project doesn't make it any good.  These people are just thieves.   And they want any lame reason they can think of to serve as an excuse for being leeches.   Bro... he has to PAY for it then.  He clearly just wants it for free and all these lame overstated reasons are simply justification for theft.    I get its hard to watch it... but stealing it is not the solution.  It's hard to buy a car.  That doesn't mean you just take whatever one you see on the street.   Yeah but you can't keep doing free trials everytime a show is on tv.     The point is its a pain to access it... so why do it?  There are si many other shows that are available that aren't so difficult to access.        I couldn't hardly get through the first season.  It was so gratuitous and bad.   I've owned a lot of trucks and I don't think I've owned one with vents in that location since the 90s.   I don't know where they are now... but not there.     Regardless those vents wash all liquids away from where the air is pulled in.    Most people use recycled air settings as it is more efficient and you don't smell the pollution from other cars in front.   I'll just pick up some tomatoes, cucumbers, and 80 kilos of calcium hypochlorate.   Yup.  How many architects are also master programmers?

I'm good then. That's what I do.    I thought I had Monsters Inside Me.   Fuck that show really hard.   That's just seasoning.   It means everything I wanted was taken so I said fuck it and made it as lame as possible.   Those percentages are huge and scary.    Do these parasites reside within the vegetables or can they be washed off?     Yeah... and they sell them to WA and Org.   No one said the beer had to be brewed in the state that consumes it.  It was a joke anyway, Mr. Know-it-all-correct-everyone.   That's it.     Who is they?    As a basement dwelling expert my twinkies don't have ecoli.   Sauce?   Cali only. Oregon and WA just drink obscure piss tasting small brewery beer and type on typewriters in the most ridiculous places.   That's it I'm not eating anymore so that I can live forever.   Dude... Fucking cool it.   turns out its way up in the fucking sky like on morrowind.   Well yeah... no one is paying tax really at that wage level.    Americans are about manufactured crisis.  Gotta stop all those tax dodging food servers.  When it's REALLY about giving businesses a pass on paying people a wage they can live off of.   If he doesnt die of old age by then....  He will be 79 at the end of his first term...  He better have a damn good Vice President for me to vote for him because odds are that VP will be required to replace him.   Well this pope isn't likable to the whole world.    He pissed a lot of people off here in the Philippines; where the demands he made for his visit required money for Yolanda recovery to be diverted to his needs.  Then he dipped out as soon as a small tropical storm hit.  I guess he didn't have enough FAITH that God would keep him safe.     feeding stray animals is illegal?    Well the whole reason they make less than minimum wage is because tips cover the difference and also taxes.    If you erase the difference then the only reason is taxes.  The law was originally passed on the premise that servers were not reporting their tips and not paying taxes on them.    So.... how do you get people to stop tipping after it's no longer necessary.  Otherwise you just go back to the same problem of people getting tax free income.   That was like 12 hours and everyone came back cause voat sucks    Those aren't dicks... this is eggplant beer.

They are supposed to be for cleaning foods; especially fish (after/during scraping scales off) and produce.     Not really sure why they put this in the area where you wash hands....      Look bowls have not reached vintage status yet....    Well to be fair... the entire empire was after solo and even they had a difficult time capturing him.     He had to get fucked over by a friend to make it happen.  Han Solo is a smuggler... so escape and evade is kinda what he is at the core.. I mean.. he's the brass fucking ring when it comes to capturing. So I don't really fault boba for failing at that.     Immitation is the highest form of flattary.     I liked, in Star Wars, how all the props and costumes would have dings and scratches and other signs of wear and tear.    When everything is shiny and in perfect condition it is easier to tell it is fake or made of plastic or whatever.   I have never been paid minimum wage for not making any tips.  I was a waiter for 6 years.     I cannot substantiate these claims based on my experience.   I travel the world on the regular and I get the shittiest service in the USA. Because the workers are stressed and it shows.     you're tipping the business by subsidizing the low wages they pay.   This makes me feel something inside.  I'm not sure if it's anger or what...   I lived off being a waiter for many years.  Yes I had big nights where I made hundreds....  I still would have taken regular pay over that.    Because my landord doesn't take the "tips were shitty this month" excuse on late rent.   How would you get people to STOP tipping after such law is passed?    The smell: Is it fresh and cooking?   Look at the cooks:  Are they clean?    Thats it.      If the food looks 2 hours old and the cook has more dirt on his clothes than the bottom of his shoes.... then it's a true hole in the wall.

How dare you make fools of us by reading out the names of our shit.   China.   Or is it Japan?    THIS!  THAT'S MY PROBLEM!  I have been fighting messy writing for years and as I write more neatly, I realized how painful it was after just a page and then I got sloppy again.    I never realised it was because I am fighting myself.   To err is human.   To Arr is pirate.     I saw that written on the wall of a pizza place here in Manila.   Why don't you lefties learn how to write from right to left?      I agree except for the war part.   The president is Commander in Chief.  Congress still had to declare war as it did with both Iraq and Afghanistan.     If the president orders an air strike for immediate response I don't think we should be opening impeachment.     Commanders have always had a little leeway in their operational parameters without having the order to attack come from above.   We should not handcuff ourselves from immediate response.   I think our system for engaging in war is still okay.      I'm not sure if you're one of those people that think all combat=war but as a combat vet I'd take issue with that.  Can't sit around waiting for Congress to bicker about declaring war whilst some group of people rape and murder or attempt to take over.     Do you think the volitile nature of modern politics would be capable of writing a constitution that stands for over 200 years and works as well as the first one?   That's true.   Like the prohibition and then it's undoing.   You know I never looked at it from this angle.    I'd worry about not having a bill of rights.... but i can see where having a constitution has made a lot of aspects of modern day life more difficult.  It isn't clear any longer how the old constitution should be interprered and applied for the modern world.  Society, culture, and technology have changed so much.     I like this... you pick option C out of A and B.     you're the man.  I never even considered simply not having it.      You are so FUCKING ignorant.   50 years ago there werent many institutions to check ones self into.   And they were more like torture than actual help.      I'm turning off inbox replies.   You're so ridiculous dude!   Gotta be trolling....   Yeah which would make your point moot.... so obviously you typed that without actually believing it.    I assumed you left out a word because it completely contradicts your original point that he should have done something about his illness..     HE FUCKING DID      If you actually read about him it turns out he did ask for help.  But 50 years ago was the dark ages for mental health care.   Seriously consisting of techniques like blood letting, electric shocks, and shoving spikes into the patients brain....  I'm done here.     Bro... when are you going to stop demanding that an unhealthy irrational mind should function like a healthy rational mind?   You need to check yourself in.....   It wasn't an option because he wasn't capable of making the decision.   Good Mental health care was pretty much non existing existing at that time.     Stop talking now.   You don't know what you're talking about.   So... you know how many sick people do that and still don't get help?  Writing does not equal the capacity to make a decision to check yourself into a place that has reputation of torture. Insane Asylums at that time are a place you didn't want to be.  Keep talking and embarrassing yourself by displaying a deeply flowing ignorance.   Especially during his time.    Holy cap!      What?   You clearly don't know anything about mental health.    Obviously a mind that is broken is not going to have rational thoughts like " maybe I should go to an institution".     Also the insane asylum during this time was not a place you want to go.     Makes you wonder how many people we kill in execution that may have a health problem effecting their choices.     Plus the **GENUINE HORN W/KILL PHOTOS** will pull a higher price.      No... it'll be a selling point.    "Genuine Horn" with photos of the kill... .people will pay MORE for it than they do now.     Yeah but they were all in a coma. That's how it stays plausible.   	106
 Yeah, but the show has already deviated from the books (and I expect this to get even more pronounced as Season 5 develops). Ain't no going back now.     the therapist would have to report you to authorities  If that's true then it's terrifying - and infuriating, because such a law would keep many pedophiles from seeking help, thus directly endangering children!   I agree. I don't believe that he can be faulted for having such desires (after all, you don't get to choose your sexuality) but his unwillingness to seek help for it is a red flag for me. If you have pedophilic tendencies you represent a danger to other people, no matter how well you think you have it "under control".     Well ain't you just a ray of ~~thinly veiled rage issues~~ sunshine.    Speaking as a European (from a country that is basically being worshipped by U.S. pro-gun people, mostly for inaccurate reasons) if limited magazine size is your biggest gripe with a candidate for the presidency you oughta be jumping for joy...   I just downloaded his thesis and flipped through it, curious about the writing style. The first thing I noticed? The dedication:  In the hopes that this work may in some way contribute to their exploration of space, this is dedicated to the crew members of this country' s present and future manned space programs. If only I could join them in their exciting endeavors.   Made my day!     Where did she say that?  She was talking about 23 year old men who *pursue sexual relationships with underage girls*, not all 23 year old men. That's a pretty big difference!   You can resign from the council. Voila!   What's safe or unsafe about any of us? Are you asking because you think that white men *specifically* are less 'unsafe' than other groups of the population or because you don't understand / disagree with the concept of a safe space?  I'll give you an example: Twice a month me and a whole bunch of my male friends get together for an evening - no women allowed. Activities differ - we might go for a hike or play some b-ball or go see a movie or have ourselves a good, old-fashioned N64 multiplayer-party. Usually there's copious amounts of drinking involved as well. We always have a great time.  And always, at some point in the evening, we start talking for real. Discussions that we can't have (or can't have in that way) with our girlfriends (and in the case of two of my mates, boyfriends). We talk about issues in our relationships, our careers, our physical and mental health and we all get a lot out of these talks. Because sometimes it's just nice to get some feedback on your issues from people who have similar experiences without having your partners involved.  That's an example of a safe space. Don't you see the value in that?    Yeah, I gotta agree.   Hey i made as many as of you hosts so please invite loads of BME women and non-binary people!!  Also if you've been invited and you're a man and/or white PLEASE DON'T COME just cos I invited a bunch of people and hope you will be responsible enough to respect this is a BME Women and non-binary event only... Don't worry lads we will give you and allies things to do ;-)  I think that post is silly but I also think the word "ban" is hyperbole. Safe spaces can be useful tools - just think of women's or men's shelters, support groups for addictions or illnesses(Damn you Marla Singer)).    I remember reading research about incidences of anorexia suddenly sky-rocketing in developing countries when their TV stations started broadcasting western programming (I want to say sitcoms but I'm not sure) for the first time that depicted thinness as an attractive trait. If you're interested I can try and find it as soon as I'm not on mobile anymore.  In general I think that people who don't believe that we're influenced by the media are the same sort of people who claim that "ads don't work" on them...

I remember more than one game-changing interception return from Brown during this season. Talk about a guy that brought such intensity every week, going all-out is why he had so many injuries, and when he would get injured you could see how much it frustrated him to be on the sidelines. We miss you, Mike Brown. '  Edit: Confirmed info: Brown had two walk-off interception returns for TDs during the 2001 season.   Why did you have to bring up 2004 Cubs? Haven't watched baseball since.   [This McLaren?](http://imgur.com/a/IAfoX) That guy actually was parked in front of a pizza place the other night, so from your husband's directions that'd put you in Alexandria.   TIL the Acura NSX has a spare tire under the hood.   If you're listening on WBBM: Every time Tom Thayer says "Unbelievable!"   I think you may have really high hopes for Greg, but it makes sense that he'd be Cam's next guy to throw to after S.Smith. Plus, I sort of hate Eli Manning after last year's inconsistencies.     Picking Charles at #7... I'm happy to say that I was able to do the same, shocking as it may be.   If I remember correctly, there was a model called the VL that was lower. It had a 2.0L instead of the 2.2L in the RS. Also, it was missing those badass white wheels, and Rally Sport trim.   1991 Chevy [Cavalier RS](http://carphotos.cardomain.com/ride_images/1/3093/1221/7730610002_large.jpg) Owned this car in high school/freshman year of college, and actually drove it from 2005 to 2007; which is shocking, because today it is one of the most egregious vehicles that I have ever seen let alone owned.   The car was sort-of white and featured electric blue and black trim along each bumper and exterior door panel. Giant electric blue and black letters saying "CAVALIER RS" bedecked the driver doors. The Rally Sport edition that also had painted-white metal wheels. Mine was literally falling apart. Any parking lot where I closed my door was sprinkled with rusty dust.   Then, literally everything on the car broke. Someone slammed into the driver's door in high school, so that didn't open. The power locks broke, so I was forced to climb through the trunk should I decide to lock the doors that actually worked. No A/C. No Heat. I came out of class one day to notice that the exhaust system had literally snapped in half, and  I dragged the pipe down the street going a top speed of 30mph with my gas pedal to the floor.   The good news? I sold it for $100 in '07.  TLDR: The 1991 Cavalier RS is an incredibly shitty automobile.    But... these shirts were on clearance.   So, this is in Mexico?   It's a fantastic looking car. However, keep looking for someone willing to fall in love with it if you want top dollar. Despite the car being out of production, there seem to be plenty of them in the used market; I don't think you will get a ton of calls if you're pricing it over $20,000.     Comparable GTOs are going for ~$20K. Have you got a picture? If not how externally modified is it?     I saw this thing in Old Town Alexandria, VA about 3 weeks ago; nearly everyone on the street stopped to look at it!    Actually we did forget Cam Barker, intentionally.   A nice tribute to the nineties at least with the Dodge Shadow grille   Animaniacs touches... Let me go off on a tangent and say that was a truly great show.   [Here are a couple options through DC social sports.](http://dcsocialsports.com/leagues/soccer?state=LIVE locationId=) The co-ed league is more at the recreational level. (Although the teams I have played for had some really great females on them). The men's league is much more competitive. We play at the Long Bridge Park soccer fields, they are synthetic turf, and lighted for night games. Plus, the league usually has a bar component where everyone goes out and drinks post-game.   Will do; thanks for the resource!   I have been offered a position to teach middle school social studies in DC. After just speaking with my principal in passing, she said that she would like to sit down with me and discuss the "scope and sequence" for the 7th   8th Grade social studies curriculum next year. From my research, I'm picturing that this is a long term, big-picture framework for district wide lesson planning. However, she mentioned that she was not satisfied with the last social studies teacher's "scope and sequence." Which makes me believe that I may have to do some collaborating with her to make the overall, big-picture framework.   Of course, when I sit down with her I would like to appear like I know what I'm talking about. So, if those of you out there in r/historyteachers-land could give me some information on what I can expect to talk to her about I'd greatly appreciate it! I have seemed very confident in my interactions with her thusfar, but she is a bit intimidating (Columbia Teachers' College grad, and also a big history nerd). Just trying to avoid being sent to the social studies teachers' graveyard like the last guy.   [This is the only example I was able to locate online](http://dcps.dc.gov/DCPS/Files/downloads/In-the-Classroom/How-Students-Are-Assessed/Grade%207%20ELA%20SAS%20SY13-14.pdf)      Thanks!    Also, that Focus is very fun to drive. I had to drive a friend of mine home once in a Focus hatch from this era, and I was very impressed with its pickup and handling. Probably had all the same features as yours, but she had hers shipped here from the Netherlands, so it gave it an extra cool factor. One of the most fun cars I've driven for sure.   It is a rare rear-wheel drive beast. However, this guy had [the last of the Grand Prix GXPs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Pontiac_Grand_Prix_GXP_.jpg)   Just found this! [It's never too late, man](http://www.recycler.com/details/24681296)   Not necessarily stupid though, more of a sad trade-off. The area I moved to last winter made driving my Pontiac far too laborious. I got a "smarter" car that saves me money on both fuel and VA requirements. However, it lacks the special feel of driving the Pontiac.   I was going through a quarter tank of gas every day working in DC, and then I find out that Northern VA has a 24-point inspection for road safety. (My driver's door didn't shut properly   power windows didn't work among some other issues with the power steering) All in all, I sold it in MD for $4000 in exchange for a friendlier DC driver (the Elantra).   In summary, we aren't making "stupid" decisions, just dealing with the reality of the increasingly Pontiac-less motoring world of today.    your rant is completely justified. I can't even tell you how many people had the same criticism of GM about the frankly dumbass choice of preserving Buick. The consumers need to let their voice be heard. Time to put the soulless division of Buick to sleep and resurrect the excitement that was Pontiac!!!!!!    I feel you. I had a Grand Am GT Coupe that I bought when I was 19, and I just let it go this past February. Let's not credit Pontiac for making the best quality cars; but Pontiacs did inspire a certain feeling for those who owned them. It was certainly a car that I was excited to drive.    let's hope. Front end looks majorly improved.   $33, not too big of a deal    Well put. Although, I wish all my neighbors their just reward for not being a great resident of Alexandria like myself.    Yeah. Plus, it isn't very much anyway. I've paid 3 times as much for "city-stickers" before. Guess I should have made the association that city-sticker=a source to generate revenue for the local gov't (aka TAX). Initially, I was taken aback back by the term "vehicle property tax."    I've been in Alexandria for about six months now, but after buying a car in FL, and then switching over to VA license and registration I have paid the "vehicle property tax" and posted the sticker on my car as proof.   Here's the thing, less than half the cars in my neighborhood have City of Alexandria stickers on them. I'm noticing that a number of the ones that do have stickers also have out-of-date ones. Is the vehicle property tax just something that isn't really enforced in AVA? And am I a sucker for even paying it?    I'm calling an ugly one by Shaw ending it.   some of us might remember john scott's being longer   "so big and long" -pierre    Just Game 1...buckle up.   Thought you had the lead? Oduya now?   Shaw has impressed in this game, he's due for one of his own.   Join DC Social Sports   Classic Kane. When they were coming into the league those radio commercials with Toews and him were painful and hilarious at the same time.   Not sure I'm feeling that Camaro he's driving.   Listen to John Wiedeman and Troy Murray online on WGN radio. These guys are hands down the best as far as intensity, analysis, and general passion for the Hawks goes. I live in Washington DC and try to blast the volume on these guys whenever possible... although it makes me long for my hometown.   [Wiedeman   Murray!](http://tv.trb.com/extras/wgnam/player/listen.htm)    [This is a great looking car.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Mazda3MPS.JPG) Probably an overall better choice from a financial standpoint + I really like the front end on this generation better.   Got to love that Q has him back on the wing; Center was not a great fit.    I'm looking at Kane to score more goals than last year despite the abbreviated season    Unfortunately, I didn't get to experience the concept of the "two hour delays" that can happen here in the schools that I work in. (I would assume more snowfall needed.) The reactions are certainly different than the midwest; I remember having to walk to high school with 16 inches of snow on the ground in Chicago. I think my school had one snow day every 40 years.   Just moved here 1 month ago from Chicago. The top two things I miss are:  1. The Blackhawks 2. Being able to order Giardiniera on things  I'm not about to jump on board with the Caps, though. I think we'll be lucky to see 5-6 Hawks games on local tv in DC this year. Such a shame, because this team is going to tear it up this year.   Got to love that car. Is that a Ford Aspire, Donovan?    Raffi Torres for sure.   What about the [Dodge Daytona](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Daytonashelbyz.jpg)? It looks like it was built on the same platform as the Starion; much like the Mitsubishi Mirage was to the Dodge Colt.     Hondas and Toyotas have the best reputation for reliability; however, in your price range you can expect six-digit odometer numbers. I think that you may be able to find an Elantra with 60-70K miles on it.     Yep. Darryl Drake.   So what's up with Shaw then, just 1 goal on the season so far?    Thank you. From what I read in a guide to teacher certification reciprocity, it seemed that 3 years experience was almost a requirement to have my certificate recognized in MD.    Thanks! This is very helpful, I haven't really sought out the charter school opportunities in Chicago too enthusiastically, but I'm probably better equipped to take on those challenges now than I was a year ago. I'll definitely investigate. Any insight that your wife could provide would be greatly appreciated.   [Mr.Robber's Neighborhood] (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61CCYSHrSds)= Sven's best parody.   Please tell me what is the job market for teachers like in the metropolitan area?   I am moving here next month from Chicago as part of a project that my current employer is doing. However, I'm a certified teacher and haven't gotten a classroom in IL due to an insane disparity between many applicants and very few openings. (not to mention widespread district cutbacks, etc.) I'd love to teach in DC or northern VA.   So redditor-educators of DC, what type of climate should I expect? Are there any districts that you know of that I should target? Do you know of any paraprofessional/teaching-aide positions that may be opening up in the near future? I'd love to get my foot in the door, and would be open to ditching my employer to make a positive step in obtaining my goal of teaching in the classroom.   Any suggestions or advice would be much appreciated.  Thanks!!     That has got to be Wal-Mart.   Soccer fans are ok with it, because the result is 45 minutes of continuous play uninterrupted by commercials.  	61
 :) :) Not high.. That response was just a thought.. Although all proverbs are not metaphors.. some damn certainly are!   *The Brief History of Time* by Stephen Hawking - fits your specs of scientific non-fiction.. That being said, there are great books in non-ficiton domain. Try exploring books that are outside the apparent science genre because when you look keenly, everything has science at its heart.   Books by :  * Malcolm Gladwell, Nassim Nicholas Taleb (fall under Social Science) * Michael Lewis, Tim Harford  ( fall under Financial Science)  are very insightful.  And then:  * Isaac Asimov (if you ever find any non-ficiton book by this person, devour it without second thought, he's that good.) * try reading biographies of remarkable people.. I loved Steve Jobs by Walter Isaacson * Walden by Henry David Thoreau   Into The Wild by Jon Krakauer * A must read novel: *Flatland* by Edwin A. Abbot * The Flipside by Adam J. Jackson  These are some of my recommendations for now, just to make you get used to reading interesting stuff.. and once you do that you will automatically start finding books on your own!    don't take Chinese proverbs literally. Same goes for any language proverbs.  True. Proverbs, in their deepest sense, are merely brilliant metaphors.    no, it seems OP did not make it up  :) You're right.. I did not.   Harry Potter's magical world!   I experience this whenever I stay away from reading for more than a couple of days. Something seems missing in my daily life when I do that. And this quote seemed very appropriate for this sub where *reading* is a part of our lives... So I just thought we should see this.  EDIT: This post made some people feel like we are looking down upon non-readers.. No. We are not.. And this quote doesn't share even the least bit of such intentions. *Reading is about knowledge, but it is no real knowledge if it doesn't tell you how to treat people that are different from you in ways that you feel are vital for a person's ethos.* I offer my apologies to all those who felt hurt by a few number of comments that some people (may be even me) posted here. We sincerely don't mean to hurt anybody ever in the matters of book reading.. **May be we kid sometimes, here and there, but we are all a brotherhood here!**   Thanks, everyone :)   I guess you took this quote right out of Austin Kleon's blog... Worthy quote, though!   IN 2014:  * I STARTED MY JOB CAREER. MOVED TO A FAVOURITE CITY OF MINE, PUNE, INDIA. * I TOOK UP [R/NOFAP](http://www.reddit.com/r/nofap) CHALLENGE ON REDDIT FOR 131 DAYS IN A ROW WITHOUT A SINGLE REPALSE. * I [FINISHED READING 25 BOOKS](http://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/2qoi2p/im_24_now_i_was_free_much_of_2013_and_id_read_36/). * I GAINED AWESOME FRIENDS AT MY COMPANY DURING THE TRAINING PERIOD. * I'M A BLOGGER. I WROTE GOOD STUFF THIS YEAR. * IN NOVEMBER, I TOOK UP A WRITING CHALLENGE FOR MYSELF AND WROTE MORETHAN 13 THOUSAND WORDS IN 21 DAYS. (EVERYDAY HAS A MINIMUM OF 500 WORDS IN ITS NAME FOR 21 DAYS AT A STRETCH.. I'M A NON-NATIVE IN ENGLISH.. LIKE I MENTIONED BEFORE, I'M FROM INDIA..) * WITH THE PUSH THAT WRITING CHALLENGE HAD GIVEN ME, I STARTED WRITING FLASH-FICITON FOR THE FIRST TIME IN MY LIFE IN ORDER TO IMPROVE MY FICTION WRITING SKILL. (I WANT TO BECOME AN ENGLISH LANGUAGE NOVELIST!) * DECIDED NOT TO TAKE UP ANY, SO CALLED, 'NEW YEAR RESOLUTIONS' FOR 2015.   BUT THAT'S ALL IN THE PAST.... NOW IT IS ANOTHER YEAR, MOTHERFUCKERS. SO LET'S GOD DAMN BE CONCERNED ABOUT THE **NOW** PART.     MAJOR FUCKING NATIONAL EXAM NEXT YEAR  I WISH YOU ALL THE VERY BEST WITH ALL MY HEART FOR YOUR EXAM THIS YEAR.      UNSTOPPABLE MAGMA-BLOODED RHINO  THAT IS JUST FUCKING WELL PUT.   Awesome post, pal.. Thanks for posting... It's very inspiring....  especially the below line:   It is time to take that pain, that agony and use it to build from here.  I've my things lined up for this year, which actually started in December 2014, and that was a very apt line for me to remember. Thanks :)   The Wiki link is obvious... but I'm more interested in personal opinions and experiences of people here.. Thank you though :)   Nah :)   awesome... if you do any such ones plz do post the links here in the comments.. because I'm saving this post already :)      Hey, high five.. Same problem with me as well.. I suck at writing dialogue. And I was already skinned alive on r/destructivereaders for that.   Haha :) :) That would serve a great purpose indeed :)   Yeah.. Simple as that..   Read. Stop. Repeat.   ok.. after moving to Pune in March of 2014, I had been to a book sale where they were selling books by weight.. 1 KG for (just) Rs.100/-  I bought 23 books for (just) Rs.570/-  That's the best buy, not just of 2014, but of my life till date :)   Honestly, my best buy of the year relating to books is the Rs. 1100/- broadband internet connection.. *(If you know what I mean!)*   I've always had this doubt since I read *Gitanjali* by Rabindranath Tagore, him being the first author I read that was awarded Nobel in Literature.. and then I went on to read Ernest Hemingway's *Old Man And The Sea* and John Steinbeck's *Of Mice And Men*...   I loved *Gitanjali*, liked *Of Mice and Men* and disliked *Old Man and the Sea*..   I thought it's time I clarify to myself about how Nobels are awarded in Literature category. So, here I am asking about it. Please shed some light. Thanks :)   I can't suggest you any books but I am surely taking some titles out of your list as suggestions for me.. Thanks :)   Hey very informative reply, pal....    And I just love this thread :)    The Alchemist. No matter how meandering the path, the journey is worth it.  This book is a part of my life..    Although I like your determination and all, it's a serious way to turn reading as a chore than as a pleasing hobby.. Reading is a blessing, and don't count your blessings word by word, pal, counting them by books and their respective pages is enough already.. But that's just me :)    there's so much to be read!   Yes.. there's so much to be read.... It's like a Universe in itself.. There is always very much more to know of :)   Oh.. roger that :)    One per week.   Awesome.. All the very best and Happy New Year :)   This isn't even a bit about Hindu mystic bullshit.. or for that matter any religious bullshit... It's solely about my own mystic mind's bullshit. Simple as that, buddy :)   Sorry, although I've a Masters in Computer Applications, I don't like the idea of algorithms telling me what to read next. I would like to leave that duty to the destiny.  But thanks for sharing the link here, there are people who prefer to believe in digitized life than in a destined one.. they would love the link, I guess. So, here is my upvote for the post :)   The main thing that drove me and still drives me towards reading more books is *I'm an aspiring writer*.. and to write better you gotta read better and read like hell... So once I tried to take up writing seriously, and as they say *when you pick up one end of the stick you pick up the other end too..*, I had to take reading seriously as well... and that lead me through myriad portals toward the kind of stuff I'm interested to read/write about.. and I kept picking up books..   So, that's the most important thing about forming my reading habit.. and also another vital aspect is I was gifted a *Kindle Paperwhite* by my brother-in-law for my birthday around July 2013, and thence my reading habit got redefined :)  And coming to the part of feeling reading as a *chore*: I've a weakness in my mind.. that is when I start reading a book and if I don't feel interested in it or if it felt tough or anything, I simply cannot give up reading it.. I feel defeated by that book when I do that.. I somehow continue it till I end it.. So during such times, yes, reading feels like a chore... In the list I mention in the post, the books that especaily felt like that were: *The Loser* by Peter Ustinov and *Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde by R. L. Stevenson* (I'm trying to fight this weakness, which would help me save time and makes reading not to feel like a chore, at times..)  Rest all were fine, but I obviously didn't like all the books equally...   So, that's about it :)  Thank you so much for the interest you showed in asking me about my habit forming..   Roger that.. Thank you for the correction.. Will remember when I use it next time :)   I was just like you till a couple of years ago... Maybe you too would pick up the reading habit soon.. Good Luck.. Happy New Year :)   good resolution..   I'm thinking to name 2015 as *my year of short-stories*.. I'm an aspiring writer, and I recently started to write flash fiction to practice my fiction writing abilities.. So, I'm thinking to read lots of short stories in 2015.. atleast 100 short stories.   I got recruited from my campus (NIT Kurukshetra, India) in the March of 2013 itself while I was in the final semester of my Masters.. but the joning date didn't turn up till the March of 2014.. meanwhile I picked up reading books all along that waiting period.. and also a bit freelance writing.. I'm a blogger, too.   yeah I love non-fiction.. especially the ones that talk about technology, economics, science, and ofcourse biographies... among the list the non-ficition books I read this year are *Next* by Micheal Lewis, *The Accidental Billionaires* by Ben Mezrich, *The Undercover Economist* by Tim Harford, *The Tipping Point* by Malcolm Gladwell, *Tuesdays with Morrie* by Mitch Albom... I loved each of them.. and among biographies, last year I read and **loved** *Into The Wild* and *Walden* (although not a bio) and another technology book about Big Data.. and I also started *Steve Jobs* by Walter Isaacson but did not finish it as I didn't carry the book with me later... But i loved whatever I read from it.   The non-fiction book that I'm currently reading is *Representative Men* by Ralph Waldo Emerson.. and I plan to pick up *The Information* by James Gleick in 2015 :)  Non-fiction is almost always awesome :)   Finally, finished the book... and also took help of *Sparknotes* to understand it better... Thanks, guys :)   Thank you :)   Thanks :)   I know they're not great numbers compared to what people here usaually hold.. But still, I did fine for where I came from..  I'm a non-native in English, (from India), so I slowly picked up the habit of reading books, and now they're an integral part of my life. Books mean a lot to me. My dream is to become an English language novelist. So, I look forward to develop my reading habits and abilities to a great extent in the future.  The list of the 25 books that I've finished in 2014 are:  * *The Great Gatsby* by F. Scott Fitzgerald  * *The Man Who Japed* by Philip K Dick   * *The Accidental Billionaires* by Ben Mezrich  * *Tuesdays with Morrie* by Mitch Albom  * *Siddhartha* by Herman Hesse  * *The Doomsday Conspiracy* by Sidney Sheldon  * *The Illusions* by Richard Bach  * *The Flipside* by Adam J Jackson * *Animal Farm* by George Orwell * *Saving Faith* by David Baldacci  * *The Loser* by Peter Ustinov  * *The Undercover Economist* by Tim Harford  * *The Tipping Point* by Malcolm Gladwell  * *Screw It, Lets Do It* by Richard Branson  * *Flatland* by Edwin A. Abbott  * *1984* by George Orwell  * *Prey* by Michael Crichton  * *The Giver* by Lois Lowry  * *Out of My Head* ( also published as *Unknown*) by Didier Van Cauwelaert  * *Next* by Michael Lewis  * *Gone Girl* by Gillian Flynn  * *The Old Man And The Sea* by Ernest Hemingway * *The Rubiyat* by Omar Khayyam  * *Of Mice And Men* by John Steinbeck  * *Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde* by R. L. Stevenson    and also an essay called *Walking* by Henry David Thoreau  Thank you r/books, for being such an awesome sub and for putting lots and lots of new books into my life.. You guys rock :)   The fuck bro.. It's awesome :D.. Thank you so much.. I was fucking surprised there are no comments on this post yet.... That's very mean :(  Especially the awesomest thing is that the videoscreen has the name of the track playing... Fuckin perfection, pal :))   Dude, come on.. that was Mark Twain... not from Michel-whatever-his-name-was!   This is SOMETHING!   awesome   Hey, it's not Ghandi.. It's Gandhi.. Sorry, pal, we Indians take this seriously..   I absolutely loved them though.. I was asking this only out of curiosity :)   BATMAN.   Here is the track that I was talking about from Predestination film. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=599vpKbNEek  This is such an intriguing track.. I would like to know more of such tracks.  Please help.. Thanks :)    Jon Krakauer    Malcom Gladwell  *Into The Wild* by Jon Krakauer is a part of my life now.. and so is *Outliers* by Mr. Gladwell.. awesome non-ficiton writers both of them...   Malcolm Gladwell and Michael Lewis.   *On Photography* by Susan Sontag   The Alchemist by Paulo Coelho, of course.. But I think you must've already read it.. Sorry, if so.   Ok.. thanks for encouraging, pal.. I will continue it :)   HEy, thanks for the list... :)   I thought that it is such a small book and a classic, too, so I felt happy to pick it up, but, boy, I was so very wrong.. The book is literally unreadable for me :(   (I'm not native English.. )  Is it only me or is there anybody else out there who felt similar difficulty??   Robert L. Stevenson, why would you do something like that, sir?? I loved your *Treasure Island!* It was such a nice read..   Great and true advice :) Thanks for reminding us to do what is necessary.   * Opening paragraph was well engaging.  * Second paragraph was tough to read and sounded very confusing. * Third slowly seemed to be losing direction.  Ok, now I better probably stop pointing out para wise.. All paragraphs can and should be improved for easy readability and visualization.   Now, there are for sure very good lines from the letter:   What are words, but dancers upon a page?   Awesome opening line.   the way you stabbed them with your tongue.  Very well put sentence.   And this letter will never meet your lips.  I didn't get if the narrator was expecting the letter to be kissed (*meet the lips?*) or just be read (done by lips as well). If you meant 'to be read' this line can be better put as: *And this letter will never flow through your lips.*  or better: *And this letter will never flow through your lips and into your heart.*  And one more thing about my critique.. If my words hurt your feelings, don't take me seriously... Keep up the good work and do awesome writing as always.  [As you mentioned that you wrote this piece over a year ago, and as it is usually said that you need a good amount of time between you *write* something and you come back to edit or *re-work* on it... I guess you just didn't look into it after that year's time, and directly posted here without reworking upon it. It's visible, the *first-draftness* in the writing]   Awesome Christmas Tree :D :D   I liked Bradbury's *Fahrenheit 451*.. What an idea it holds!! Amazing concept. By the way, what's the name of the short story collection of his that you're reading?   Can yo please share with me what you loved about *The Old Man and The Sea*?? Why am asking is I'm new to reading classic books, and I didn't enjoy this book much.. So I want to know what made people love it, so that I can read such books with that mindset next time when I pick up some.    The Old Man and the Sea    The Great Gatsby  I've read these both... They felt ok... Good ones.. Gatsby book was way better than the other, though.   First of all, I was expecting great story from the book because of all the hype of it being a classic and all.... and most importantly due to the depressive environment the entire book had bestowed upon me (I must say, in this case the author succeeded in making me feel the Dystopian time completely.. Orwell did great work at that)... So, I guess, I disliked the book mostly because I was expecting lot of great thrilling story from it rather than focusing on the classic idea of privacy invasion.. so that's the reason. My bad.    Nobody aint denied nothing  Oh that just tripled.. LOL :P   Herman Hesse is good too.. His Siddhartha was very intriguing.. Thanks, shall try Steppenwolf as well.   Steinbeck is no doubt great.. In just over a 100 page novel he came up with such an engaging story of people.. I like this kind of small books that tell a lot.. I loved *Animal Farm* as well.. Suggest me some more small books that tell a lot, if you know of any.   I love *Animal Farm* but I dislike *1984*.. Sorry, can't help :(   The first edition of *Five Point Someone* by Chetan Bhagat. The inner page of the book cover has Chetan Bhagat's coolest picture on it. I love books with their Authors' full page picture in them.    Thoreau is great! Both in life and in text.   I'm from India, and I'll probably be downvoted to hell for asking this question:  *Why do Americans use a lot of double negatives?* Isn't that a wrong usage of the language? So, why would an English speaking country use it so much??      I'm ridiculous at the things that I love... Can't help.. ;)   And you're talking as if it's a sin to do so!   Hey, 2014.. I want to thank you from the bottom of my heart for giving us this film. We will reminisce this experience all our lives. We will engrave *2014* in our hearts with golden letters, and probably sprikle some *star-dust* on it, too!  This year will remain a truly life changing period to many people, like myself, who saw *Interstellar* as more than just a film.  Thank you so much, 2014, for giving us such a cherishable conclusion for the year.     but serving in a greater sense.  Sure he is..    What does the quote actually mean?   This was a very weird concept - comparing a person to a movie and the situations in it... but interesting as well... A new perspective :)   Hmm.. may be I will :)   No.. I like italics, that is all.. and why should italicised words mean disgust? Why did you think so?   In case you haven't gone through the below post today on r/writing, please do.. It's a great motivation for writing!  http://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/2q0air/what_are_some_sentences_you_wish_you_wrote/   Second of all, your post is going to give ideas and inspiration for many nbewbies like myself.. thanks again for that, mate :)   "Anything with the power to make you laugh over thirty years later isnt a waste of time. I think something like that is very close to immortality."  That's another Stephen King right there... from *Hearts In Atlantis*   You just suggested me a new book!    Hey, OP.. First of all let me thank you for coming up with such an awesome post.. Really refreshing and requiring for aspiring writers..   That's one outstanding line. Now, I wish I wrote that!   I've never read Joyce. Was he referring to *semen,* in that sentence?    The first work I've read of Stephen King's is *Hearts In Atlantis* which is a collection of three novellas.. and I loved the storytelling in it.. Bobby's character as a young school kid in *Men In Yellow Coats* novella is written very well. I could almost relate him to me when I was a young kid myself.    Thanks, OP, for this post!   Why, indeed?    It wasn't pleasant to read... Too many neithers and nors, especially... And also a bit of hi-fi vocab here and there... Should've been easier, I guess.    fuckin' awesome!   This post also belongs in [r/Interstellar](http://www.reddit.com/r/interstellar/) I request you to please post it there as well.  It's necessary.    This sounds like it is about *The Interview* film ban!   Awesome advancement...!!!    Do you realize that you just gave me a new idea for a book, or may be a short story. Thank you so much :)   May be we give it away by finding it out...   Anyways, in this scenario Interstellar helped me stop being a creep then. But still, isn't writing poetry artistic and not creepy??    A Gripping Glitch...    true that!   Ok. I will keep that in my mind.. But here in India, things work differently.. Anyways, I wrote that poetic piece not because I just wanted to give it to her, but solely because as an artist, a writer, I couldn't hold back the explosion of feelings in my heart whenever I looked at her or thought about her.   Creepy?? Since when is expressing your love for a girl in poetic form creepy? I thought it is artistic.   Acc to me, The Lost Symbol is the least impressive RL adventure. The recent one, Inferno, is way better than TLS. But *Angels and Demons* is his best ever work.   Dan Brown - Robert Langdon novels.   (This is all from India) A couple of months ago I started liking a girl in my office.. She is a very beautiful girl.   I'm a writer by hobby, and the beauty of that girl made me pen some lines about her. I wrote a poetic piece, titled as [Her](https://medium.com/@krishna_mydream/her-c95a39117644) and I gave it to her. I don't know if she even read it or not. I tried a few times to talk to her in person after showing her that poetry, but she straight away refused so talk to me.   This whole incident had toubled me for weeks, my mind was occupied by her thoughts.. and then one fine day, November 8th, I watched the most awaited movie, *Interstellar* - and that's it.. The chains of that girl's beauty that had imprisoned my mind all along this time could not hold me back any longer, and they freed me.   The grandeur of the cosmic tale told in the film had made my mind to wash away many trivial troubling things of my life, among which is my liking towards that girl.   I'm an aspiring writer. After witnessing the mind bending brilliance of Interstellar, I realized that I had better things to do in my life than to sit back and feel bad for a rejection.   Interstellar really expanded the horizons for my exploration of stories. Now, standing in front of the enigmatic journeys into the tales of wonders of the Unvierse I can voyage into, worrying about a girl seem merely unworthy of my mind's thought process.  Thank you so much for all this, *Interstellar* :)   First, simply put *Walden* is called an *American* classic because it is a classic work written by an american (I'm an Indian, by the way).   And second, it is definitely a classic book, no questions asked. In *Walden* Thoreau's insights about where the Mankind is going in the matters of human character and environmental love, the two things that are put into each of us from the moment we take birth, are nothing less than astounding. There are many instances in the book that are capable of making us feel embarrased for the way we're living on this planet, without worrying least bit about this eternal(?) home of ours. If there is one book that should be seen with no boundaries of country, it would surely be this. Hence, please don't call *Walden* a specific *country's* classic, rather call it a Mankind's classsic, which it is undoubtedly is.   *Eldorado* by Edgar Allan Poe    Hey thank you so much for the share :) :)      Yeah now i'm interested in Gillian Flynn... I will surely read her other books but I don't read same author multiple times in short spans of time, so I will wait...    I'm from India and the movie is not present here anymore.. so I'll just wait for the DVD/Bluray to come out.. You just saw the film, so I would suggest you to wait a while and then read it... because I guess one would not be able to read a book properly under the influence of its film, so try waiting till it wears off.. but that's just my thinking though ;)   I don't generally read this kind of fiction.. I'm usually into Thrillers, Sci-Fi, Non-Fiction.. But after knowing that the movie by David Fincher has done so well I thought of picking up the book before watching the film adaptation of it.. and it was an amazing experince over all.. The most interesting part about the book is that both male (Nick) and female (Amy) narrations are great.. The thing that most intrigued me is how well Amy character turned out as the story moved forward.. It evolved very powerfully. I loved it.    A 4/5 book for me in the recent days... Awesome :) :)   My thoguts exactly... I was spellbound realizing that perfection and be this perfect!   Thank you so much for the interest.. It's a simple breathing pattern/technique. But I'm afraid I won't be able to articulate the process and benefits of Sudharshana Kriya as much as the *The Art Of Living Foudation* does, the institution where I learned it from.. So, [here is the link](http://www.artofliving.org/in-en/what-sudarshan-kriya) to where you can get a glimpse of what the Kriya process is all about.. Whatever is explained in there, believe it or not, it sure did change my thought process a couple of years ago, and I'm a person who stronly believes that your thoughts make your life, hence I can happily say that it did bring a great change in my life. (And you can also find many videos of the Kriya process on the internet, in case if you wanna try learning it.)  Good Luck and Namaste :)   Brilliant piece :) :) Thanks for sharing....   I loved the science and behind it and also Man's conflict with Nature.. especially the Chaos Theory part.. I absolutely love this book :) :)   thank you so much for reading it, pal... and special thanks if you decide to share it with others.. i'll be very thankful :) :)   interesting... good luck for whatever comes your way :) I too just did a blog on what interstellar means to me, and posted [here](https://medium.com/@krishna_mydream/pursuing-your-passion-can-be-an-interstellar-journey-e61b49187aa9).. it's more of the uplifting blog types.. but your experience is a better and new one.. try giving it a read.. Thanks :)      Hey thanks for the info and the comment.. :) :)   Good that you posted it here.. Can somebody please explain the sentence in detail??   Interesting!     	122
                                                                                                                                                                                        ?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                	184
 *Look, American families and small businesses are still struggling.  Many are still asking the question, where are the jobs?  Some Americans are doing better, and frankly thats great news.  But most middle-class families arent seeing the improvement in their daily lives.  So weve got a lot more work to do. "*  And yet he lays out no plans to do this, claims government doesn't create jobs, fights UI extension, wants to cut food stamps, welfare, school lunches. The only plan the republicans ever have is tax cuts for the wealthy, increase defense spending, 'reforming' social security, and pushing a pipeline. All the while ignoring infrastructure.  And he says 'where are the jobs'. Well, I dunno, you said people didn't need a UI extension because it made them lazy and they wouldn't find work - so you must believe there are plenty of jobs for them to work.   Yeah, I'm laughing too.      Yeah, and it's possible I read /r/gonewild just for the comments.   Yet, on the campaign trail, I am sure we will hear him say "Every vote matters!"   According to our conservative fundie friends lots of people have been hurt when jeebus sent hurricanes/etc to punish America because of gay marriage. Divorce, murder, rape, wars, ignoring the sick and the poor, etc doesn't bother god. Just gays.   Conservatives: "We have had a minimum wage for decades and we believe a few economists when they say it is bad. But we think most scientists are full of shit when it comes to climate change."  Derp.                                       Hunh. So they were going to confirm this whole time but wanted to use her for politics.   America. Fuck Yeah.         Weird, more sites are doing that, I use ghostery and ad blocker and don't see them.                                    It is patently unfair for Senate Republicans to single out same-sex marriage for government disapproval. As Sen. Hillary Clinton (D-NY) told her colleagues,  if we were really con- cerned about marriage...[w]e should have been in this Cham- ber trying to amend our Constitution to take away at the very first blush the idea of no-fault divorce  ( CR ,J uly 13,  2004, S7995). In a nation still battling prejudice against homosexual- ity,  gays and lesbians serve as easy targets for politicians as- piring to appear strong on family values. But political expedi- ency provides poor grounds indeed for continuing to treat a minority unfairly.            *shrugs * Ok...so a rw think tank is tracking birth rates for immigrants (hunh, they didn't add 'illegal' to it as a dog whistle for the idjits?)  Can't say I am shocked that a group that advocates for less immigrants is saying this and that a rw rag is picking it up.   This same group claims *The Center has asserted that there are adverse effects of immigration on the environment* - which is odd because according to the right humans have no affect on the environment and if they do it is ok because 'profit'. "Sure, dumping this waste in the lake kills all the fish and ruins your ability to drink it - but the government shouldn't stop a company from creating jobs!"  Git r done.

Just not to cnn, they will probably use cgi for their coverage and have wolf standing on the volcano :)      ISIS is filled with religious fundies, so there really isn't a science discussion to be had. To such people it can melt anything if they pray about it before hand and god wills it. Or if they accuse the beams of being gay, in which case (according to religious people in this country who vote republican) got will send storms to destroy the beams and anyone in the building that has such beams.   You have to mix it properly with the blood of a virgin (or is it Virginian? Always mix those two up). Not that I know anything about it all, my uh...friend billy told me about it.   The Grim Reaper.         She knows she won't win. She just wants to get some cred with people. She will use this to trade 'votes' from those who say they back her. She'll endorse the person she thinks will win in exchange for later political position/favors.   Think about your avg republican voter here. They don't think or care about such things really. They just want to use deaths for their own gain. 9/11/2001? Support the president or you are a traitor, use the deaths for new laws and wars.  We aren't dealing with rational people who care about the US, they just want to 'win' elections because 'winning' is awesome. When Obama won and they lost they decided to do all they could to destroy that loss, not support him (like they did bush after 9/11), and whine daily about things - including making up things (he was born in kenya, will confiscate all guns, destroy stock market, let ebola kill us all, etc).  It isn't about country for them. I would like one conservative to tell me they honestly care about this country and always did - but that won't happen because what they care about is getting some human, any human on the planet, into office with an (R) after their name. They are mad, sad (sore losers) over 2008/2012 and they care about nothing at all but 'winning' - then suddenly, not matter what or who is in office they will kneel on their flags and open their bibles and just praise them.  Just like they worshiped bush. The greatest man, to them, in the 21st century, who saved America. Yeah...I won't ever make the mistake of voting for a republican in my life again.   Funny how the right is so silent on this here. Hmmmm. Maybe they are sick of hearing of it too but don't want to upset their masters (so much courage on the right...when they aren't kneeling down and boot licking).    A 14-year-old Mexican girl seized by federal police and sent to a woman in Houston is being returned home after DNA tests showed she is not the woman's daughter.   Last week's removal of a screaming Alondra Luna from her middle school last week provoked an outcry from her family, who said authorities ignored proof of her identity.    Federal police said they were acting on a judge's orders to send the girl to Dorotea Garcia, who says the girl had been illegally taken to Mexico by her father years ago.            Religion. Sheesh, can't folks give it all a rest for a bit? "You put carpet down! AHHHHH!" *facepalm*   No matter where you seem to go in the world there are religious conservative fundies who get all upset over stupid shit. "People are hungry and dying? Wars? Meh. We must not allow desecration in a holy shrine! Where are your priorities!?"         He doesn't have the time for that. He has to focus on another benghazi investigation, the most important thing the GOP has going for them.         And when Unemployment Benefit Extensions were set to expire where was he? Oh yeah....   *Mitch McConnell Laughs at the Unemployed as He Promises to Vote No on UI Benefits*   But this, this he will fast track. Wonder who owns him? Someone obviously does.           Thanks for the information.   Oh, ok. Here is how I view it - there should be outrage whenever government agents/employees kill people. Waco and Ruby Ridge sure as hell got some people up in arms. Ah, but those were white people I guess and the right suddenly cared.  It's not my fault that white cons don't get upset when white people get killed by cops. Maybe that is because, in general, they don't care when cops shoot people. They feel it is always justified.   If you have some cases where white people were killed/hurt/etc by cops you think should be discussed because you come down on the side of the person being injured by the cops - post em. And I will back the victim of police brutality.    They are trying to, they are blaming Obama for the delays. No shocker there.   I didn't have any issue with them wanting to look into the whole ordeal and get some basic answers. But jeebus, it has gotten downright silly.   On the other hand, it really does show they have nothing else, at all, when it comes to Obama. They were wrong about him being born in kenya, wrong about him when they said he would crash the market, take all the guns, turn the US into a caliphate, threw open the borders, etc and so on.  They got nothing, and this just is making them look stupid.  You would think there would be some on the right who would see this and tell em to stuff it -but they are too invested now emotionally to act rationally.       That got tossed after 9/11/2001, Anthrax, patriot act, tsa, and the Iraq war.   Best comment I have seen all day. Upvoted it ;)      So does the city/county have to pay him?  Step 1. Speed in reverse Step 2. Get ticket Step 3. Profit   Well, someone apparently needed to - look, I can be sarcastic too! :)   Story isn't big on details, hopefully nothing but if anyone has other info please feel free to add it.         If you're in the US (as I am) you probably know our justice system is screwed up beyond all hope. I wish I had answers on how to fix it, but even if I did the system is so screwed no one would implement the fixes.   My mom put me on the bus and that was that. Sort of. She became active in the school. Volunteered her time there, got to be good friends with all the teachers and the principal. She and her best friend (whose daughter was my age and lived a few doors down) were at the school a lot and would hang out and smoke in the teacher's lounge, hand out hot chocolate to us kids who did patrol, etc.  A drone would have been easier :) but it had it's perks. I got the teacher I liked each year and me and my friend always got in the same class.   MSM is in the business of making money, and they make a lot of it from corporations that advertise on their shows.   Add in to that the big wigs in these media companies probably own stakes in gas/oil and make more profit if said companies do well (see Sanders and his take on raising royalties on land the govt leases for drilling/etc).  The internet is allowing more and more information to find it's way into the public than ever before - another reason some companies want to have more control over it.   I don't even have a tv plugged in anywhere but the kitchen, where I like to listen to a show while I cook. News sources for me are a pick and choose online. With twitter I follow every TV news station in the US (about 600 of them total, ignoring some duplicate stations and pbs ones).   Radio is mostly owned by a few corporations who restrict the local licenses (they buy them up and you can't get one - they let them sit silent to kill competition). The internet is leveling the playing field more and more.      I don't have a phone anyway, so good luck to anyone trying to call me at all :)      Isis kills more muslims than christians. Wonder which ones the fox/hannity/etc groups focus on.  It obviously isn't discrimination against christians - they probably did something bad like run from government isis soldiers who told them to stop, failed to obey orders from 'cops' etc.  Sure...maybe some were killed because they were different, but that's just a few bad apples.   Interesting how things are looked at when you apply a conservative lens to things. Suddenly, cons believe there is discrimination and hate somewhere. Hunh. Weird.   That's ok, I don't answer the phone when the IRS calls me. So we are even :)   I'll just repost what I said in another thread on this:  Is that some sort of conservative attempt at a 'gotcha' moment? Man, cons are funny people.  Ever hear the old adage "It takes money to make money"? in cases like this, yes, you use resources you have in an attempt to make a change regarding the use of said resources.  You might run a website discussing the over use of coal, and it might be powered by electricity generated by coal. That doesn't make the information you are presenting bad, it is using the system to fight the system.  Investing in the short term to change the long term, etc. But hey, it makes some people get all giddy and say "See, climate change and such isn't real! I is smurt man now, I saw someone use gas in their car and they drove to park on earth day to pick up litter! Hypocrites - it means thar ain't no problems! Wheeee look at me, I'm a super smart science minded conservative!"    Let me try to explain the disconnect.  Man is working hard to support himself and kid. It's not enough. So he gets assistance. The right calls him a bum, welfare queen, etc, and runs around posting stories about how people like him are living up eating lobster and can't possibly be poor because he owns a tv.  Then: The right sits around telling people "If you work hard, you can make it!" all the while ignoring that working hard doesn't mean that at all. It usually means you are getting taken advantage of by people who aren't working hard but running things because they invested in a company and they feel they deserve more of the profits than those doing the actual work.  Those people the right cheers (investors) but when workers ask for me they get called greedy and we are told it will hurt the company and raise prices.  A more progressive view is that, sure, I don't have a problem with investors/etc making more - but I also think kicking down more to the people doing the actual work is the right thing to do.  Here's the thing for me: Despite what the right tells you....not every human can own their own company and be a millionaire. There would be no workers. We need workers to pick up trash, build things, cook, stock shelves, etc. They are just as much a part of this economy as anyone else and while they may not invest money they do invest time (though they do invest money in a way by getting a car, gas for work, right clothes, showers each day, etc and so on).   I wonder if that makes the bacon taste better?   Is that some sort of conservative attempt at a 'gotcha' moment? Man, cons are funny people.  Ever hear the old adage "It takes money to make money"? in cases like this, yes, you use resources you have in an attempt to make a change regarding the use of said resources.   You might run a website discussing the over use of coal, and it might be powered by electricity generated by coal. That doesn't make the information you are presenting bad, it is using the system to fight the system.   Investing in the short term to change the long term, etc. But hey, it makes some people get all giddy and say "See, climate change and such isn't real! I is smurt man now, I saw someone use gas in their car and they drove to park on earth day to pick up litter! Hypocrites - it means thar ain't no problems! Wheeee look at me, I'm a super smart science minded conservative!"   It isn't necessarily that more people favor gay marriage (although they do) - I think, perhaps, more now favor less religion in our government as a reason for having some laws.  The rw argument is our nation will be destroyed, mainly by god, if we allow gays to marry, serve in the military, etc.   They don't think in a logical manner, they think in a religious way like their cousins in isis/etc. More people nowadays think more for themselves and don't need some invisible sky daddy to play dictator.  Real freedom is something conservatives fight against because it isn't something they can control with bible verses and fear. They want everyone to be obedient to what they are because they are scared if they don't force people to god will do bad things to us all.   Investor: "I want more return on my investment" conservatives: "Smart thinking, we can cut jobs, raise prices some, etc"  Worker: "I want more return on my investment of my labor" Conservatives: "Greedy bastards! You are what is wrong with this country! You don't deserve more!"   You don't need guns just like you don't need science or health care. Just pray. Like when someone you know is sick - don't donate money to find cures, help cover the costs, etc. Pray it away.  Someone is attacking the US? Just pray. You see a crime, drop to your knees and have faith.  See two men kissing? Pray and god will send storms down to punish the country.   Fundie conservatives. They don't make much sense.      If you want to appeal to them just try treating them like fellow humans and citizens who want to live, work, and defend their country and get married - sort of like everyone else is allowed to do.          Yep. And if you say it isn't you aren't truly a good christian conservative. The devil is messing with your mind and tricking you - mainly because he has more power now that people with the same genital structure can kiss/marry without being stoned.   The republican version is "Rape the earth day". They celebrate by fracking and dropping bombs all over the place and pushing for new laws to kick science books out of school (to be replaced by bibles)     Only when people who don't work for the government do it.      It does have the flag on it. Now all it needs are some bible verses on it and a cross. Add some ammo in etched with "John 3:16" and it would be a rw'er dream gun (note, I am all for gun ownership I just find some gun owners to be a little...well...'interesting').               *But members of Congress are exempted from rules that otherwise prohibit people from having assault weapons, including AR-15s, Capitol Police said.*  Laws for thee but not for me.         You must be a conservative because it went over your head. The right will howl about this and the person I replied to was stating that vandalism didn't teach acceptance. Which I agree with.  Now these same cons who will preach that in this case will ignore such core ideals and resort to any and all methods to kill/blow up things/etc in the ME thinking that by doing that they will somehow gain the acceptance and gratitude of the people they are killing. You don't gain acceptance by vandalism or wars/etc, yet it seems the right only gets that idea when it is one them on the receiving end.      Sounds like a plan to me, I got nothing better to do :)   Well, nothing teaches country in the middle east like we are serious about peace like blowing em all to hell. But for some reason we keep doing it....                     Here is what republicans want:  -Back Israel and push for Armageddon so Jesus will return.  -Ban teaching of evolution and sex ed in schools  -War with Iran (so they can "support the troops" and honor them when they get killed/injured)  -Kick people off food stamps, health care, welfare, unemployment benefits while killing jobs and then calling people lazy (like how they called the unemployed lazy while blaming obama for them not being able to get jobs....)  -Gut science when it comes to climate change and space, funnel money into more guns for peace  -Privatize more schools and prisons so their backers can profit (money is the true god of the right, the golden calf if you will)  -Ban gay marriage, kick gays out of the military - all so that they can save America from hurricane and floods (and earthquakes, like in Oklahoma which are being caused by fracking, but the right denies it because it is science and not in the bible).  And so much more.    That was shitty of her, but she probably doesn't give a crap what I think. But now that they have the body she is in deep doo-doo.   If we treated sports like politics the Buckeyes would still be national champions :)   For Conservative Media, Iran Is Always A Year Away From Having Nukes  http://mediamatters.org/blog/2012/02/21/for-conservative-media-iran-is-always-a-year-aw/185058  *In December 2005, both Rush Limbaugh and a Washington Times editorial repeated a distortion from the Drudge Report of comments by International Atomic Energy Agency director general Mohamed ElBaradei regarding how soon Iran might have a nuclear weapon; the Times claimed ElBaradei said Iran was "a few months" away and Limbaugh claimed ElBaradei said Iran was "months away."*   Netanyahu in 1992: Iran close to having nuclear bomb:  1992: Israeli member of parliament Binyamin Netanyahu predicts that Iran was 3 to 5 years from having a nuclear weapon.  1992: Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres predicts an Iranian nuclear warhead by 1999 to French TV.  1995: The New York Times quotes US and Israeli officials saying that Iran would have the bomb by 2000.  http://www.juancole.com/2012/09/netanyahu-in-1992-iran-close-to-having-nuclear-bomb.html               Well, republicans are big on 'belief' - from their religion and fear god will kill us all because of gays to believing climate change is just a scheme to make money.   It's all about belief and not facts/science.                  Cons tells us if you work hard companies will reward you. Unless you are just an avg worker they can ditch after your hard work and replace with someone younger and cheaper.  Of course, they also believe every single human on the planet can own their own company and be wealthy. Wouldn't be any workers of course...but hey, details don't matter....   Ah, republicans, the party of science.  Earth is 6k years old, climate change is BS, being gay is a choice that causes god to send hurricanes.  The American isis wears a flag and carries a bible.               Most developed countries have single payer, paid sick time and holiday time off, more time off for pregnancy/birth, and spend a lot less on their military.  They also usually have more restrictions on guns.  So...not sure why I care what other countries have when it comes to abortions.         Guess we should treat guns like women's rights then the right will do all they can to pass laws restricting them.  Or treat women like guns and they will become holier than the cross to the right.   Often times people, like the disabled, send someone to the store for them. Or someone may have transportation issues, etc.   Just wait, breitbart/levin/etc will be out later saying that Obama is sending our ships there to give them to Iran as a gesture of peace and working together to make the US into a caliphate.  And the right wing will believe it.   Another weird thing is that Jews don't believe Jesus was the son of god, basically they are 'atheists' when it comes to Christianity.   *Do not be unequally yoked with unbelievers. For what partnership has righteousness with lawlessness? Or what fellowship has light with darkness?*  Overall, Jews reject the ideas of Christians but fundies have bound themselves to those who reject their beliefs. They see Israel as their path to both salvation from punishment and to the end times. Their belief is that if they are nice to a nation that rejects the very core of their beliefs they will get some sort of favor in return (and they seem to forget all the times god punished israel/judah for rejecting him....).  Their allegiance doesn't really make a lot of sense. I can see them as an ally in the region from a strategic point of view. But to put them above reproach and accuse anyone who speaks out against their policies as anti-semitic/hater/anti-christian is just...well, nuts.   Not the media so much as the actual people themselves, especially (but not only) online.  I follow every tv station in the US on twitter and see plenty of news. Yeah, there are some loons on the left too - another reason I am proudly, and have been since '84 a registered independent.  Now the news I read (out side a few places) generally isn't overly slanted (because I see so much of it). But I do read comments and rw sites/comments. I also listen to a lot of radio and shows on talkshoe (where anyone can broadcast live for free, have a chatroom and phone number for call in).  And the more I have seen/heard the more I am convinced that the rw cons in this country are just plain nuts. Not rational people trying to have a rational discussion.   As far as hurricanes/gays - just google around. And what you will find are the people saying that are conservatives and republicans. And to make it more interesting try to find someone with that alignment saying it's crazy. They just shrug and ignore it as though they expect it or partially believe it (Christians are a huge chunk of the populace here and the more fundie ones are republicans - and they do believe god punishes the US for it's 'sins)  The left has it's wackos as well, but with a big tent they tend to fight with each other and it balances out in a broad sense. On the right folks tend to march in lockstep on a broad scale. They have a common hate (obama/liberals) and a common core (bible/religion).  The two groups are different.   Nice use of 'strawman' - people seem to pull out that word a lot....  Conservatives here in the US are, by and large, loony religious zealots. Against gays in military, gay marriage, etc because they fear god will send hurricanes/judge America.   They insist Obama is a muslim - again, bringing religion into politics. They create policies based on bible verses they take out of context "If a man does not work he does not eat" kind of crap.  Their whole philosophy they back up with god. And yes, they are wanting to punish America. Look at what was being said when Obama was elected; they wouldn't cooperate with him, rush/et al said they hope he (thus we) fail.   Try listening to rw radio for a week or reading what the loonies are claiming (obama and ebola and how we were all gonna die cause he hates america, the whole stolen libyan jet BS which turned out to be false, Obama will take all the guns with no discussion of how he was going to, etc and so on).   I ain't no big fan of Obama either and not a huge fan of the aca (better than nothing to get the ball rolling). Some of his policies and decisions I can certainly complain about. But, yeah, these people are just plain nuts. If he looks the wrong way while at the podium they run off screaming he is a commie mooslim who took all the border patrol away and threw open the border for ebola laden kids trained by isis.  I don't take the right serious anymore and will never, ever, in my whole life vote for a republican (which I did up until 2004, including raising some funds for ole bush).   It's like some virus from space landed on earth and took over their minds and erased critical thinking skills, courage, honesty, etc. It makes me regret saying I ever voted for them in the past. Was i that dumb or was the party a little different last century?   Can you imagine if Hillary wins it all? My god, their heads will explode. Bet you they make a run on gun stores again swearing by all they deem holy that like Obama she WILL take all the guns. Not that she wants to, no logic on how she could if she wanted to, but that she will. And the suckers will believe it like they did with Obama.  Of course someone will come along and say "But Obama was in favor of the awb" yeah...that's a long way from he "will" take all your guns - which is what some still claim.  Not rational humans and the type who make america look dumb as hell.   Which means cons will try to get him replaced with someone more nutty. Tea party folks especially can't handle reason and logic. It's all about how they 'feel' about someone.   Of course the comments are insane - do you know any conservatives that are rational?   It's all about emotions. They are pissed off because they lost twice and want to punish obama/usa for losing. There is not one conservative that care about this country over their little parties (tea/gop). Think about it: They are mostly fundies who love Israel over the US and are praying daily for Jesus to come back and kill off most the human race. The want this. They live for it.  We're not dealing with sane or rational people. Not one, not one anywhere, will stand up and call BS on things like this, Iraq, etc because they have no courage and no principles. They just have getting on their knees for their party and to pray for god to punish/kill all the sinners.  Loony people.   Does anyone with a bit of intelligence actually read dailycaller each day? Good god, it's like WND but worse.  Of course, the people dumb enough to want congress to hold hearings about nasa and temperature readings probably would read it .  Conservatives make me embarrassed to call myself an American. If I ever travel abroad it will be with my head held in shame should anyone recognize I come from the usa.   What is most likely is the right is trolling because, as usual, they can't stand on the issues so they will just attack with made up shit.   The right is always wanting to destroy things. I guess it speaks to their ignorance and lack of desire to learn and understand things.  We took out Iraq and Afghanistan and that fixed what? Leaders of Al Qaeda and we still aren't 'safe' from terrorists and people carrying bottled water onto planes.  America has become the land of perpetual fear where there is always a 'devil' we need some party to 'save' us from. Republicans have a 'jesus' complex.   Don't even have to click on it to know it is rw'ers whining and crying because they can't win on issues :)   And Obama being born in Kenya may sink his presidential chances. Riiiight.  I love the right, they are so much fun and so easy. It's like they live in a bias bubble and can't see outside of it. Again.   It's Luke behind the mask. Or Jar-Jar.   From what I can tell by the schools, but their websites aren't clear on that :/   you can tell the republicans are scared by how loony they get.  Look at everything they claimed about Obama (and still do).    Paul lets conservatives here distance themselves from bush and the iraq war (and tsa/patriot act/etc) while still supporting what they see as conservative ideals.  In reality, they probably don't agree with him on a lot of things. When it comes to Israel, for example, they are still married to the bible above the country whereas (at one point) Paul looked at it from a more practical point of view.  Conservatives are, at their core, religious people. They react based on what they believe god wants or doesn't want. On the country side they don't care about gay marriage - but they believe god will punish a country that allows it. So paul is sort of a go between where they can pretend it isn't about religion while hedging their bets: "I am still a conservative but not really" is pretty much how it goes with them.  Paul gives them street cred early on which they will toss out the window in a heartbeat as soon as they can. They can pretend to have principles and 'look good' right now because they know he won't win. Then later they will push for someone who is truly backwards and regressive.   While people in both parties can act that way let's look at some basics.  During the bush admin, yes there were negatives tossed out. But much of it was correct. The economy tanked, wars were a bust, and we lost more freedoms and government got more power.  Obama gets elected and predictions from the GOP are a bust. Obama didn't take all of the guns, he didn't let ebola kill us all, the economy didn't tank and market crash, he wasn't born in Kenya, he didn't force all the conservatives into Fema camps and turn the US into a caliphate.  There is 'negative' and then there is bat shit crazy. The cons in this country are nuts.   Thanks for the insight.  It would be nice, imho, if the media covered more of what reps/etc do locally for people (Joyce Beatty is my rep here in Ohio) or if the reps would put more info out showing how they have helped people locally (again, all of this aside from voting).  I was complaining in an earlier thread (in news) about the lack of local talk shows on radio (consolidation, local shows replaced by big radio names, etc). Way back in my day we had more local radio where politicians actually talked about constituent services and the like.  It seems candidates disappear off the radar (to the media) when elected and the general public doesn't see the day to day work they do and feel more and more isolated from their congressperson.   Just my 2 cents :)   Like I said, I tend to be a tad cynical :)  Seems like there is a lot of 'horsetrading' that goes on in the background, lobbying, politics and the people elected are less interested in what your average person thinks about an issue than they are in bigger/more powerful/influential 'groups'.  I have had success with issues I needed assistance with in the pass by calling my congressperson. Nice people, good information, even made a call on my behalf to help get things resolved.   But when it comes to voting I just don't see A) that they would listen to me and B) that the congress person ever even knows I called/etc and what it is I said. But - obviously, they can't spend all day listening to people. Not practical.  Can you explain what happens to the letters/calls/etc - are they collated, numbers given, some comments passed on?   She could just say she is in the militia and the cat was caught sneaking over the border.   As far as Texas:   3)       Shooting stray Dogs and Cats (Penal Code 42.09 Animal Cruelty).  Any person who shoots a non-livestock animal, which includes any stray or feral cat or dog, and a wild living creature previously captured, can be charged with a felony offense.  Penal Code 42.092 of the State of Texas law states that a person must have the owners consent to kill the animal (exceptions to prosecution are provided in Section 42.092(e)(1)).  It is clear that a stray dog or cat either has no owner or that the person who shoots the animal did not get the owners consent.   How much do they even care on average? Calls, faxes, emails, which do they even pay attention to?  Seems like lobbyists $peak the loudest to them. But, maybe at my age I am just a tad cynical :)   I think they are just trying to make sure a crime really happened first. Was it feral, domestic, was it even a real cat/photo? Was the cat already dead and she just abused the body as a joke? Etc and so on.   Employers can fire you for anything, the government needs a little more to go on (usually. One would hope anyway) before charging someone.    The whole thing boils down to one simple idea:  You don't have to customize things in a way you don't want. Whether it is a credit card company and the pic you want for a background or a bakery not wanting to write something on a cake.  You still have to bake the cake, etc, but customization has always been protected. From cuss words to everything else.   I don't understand why all of that gets lost in these discussions.   Probably because a lot of more progressive people don't need to be babied and lied to in order to support their ideals. Like religious people in the ME or here - they don't want anything that contradicts their beliefs, they want someone to lie to them and validate their hate/fears.   A smart business person will give them that and get their money in return because they know not one of them would dare challenge someone on what they say. Might put a crack in their armor and belief systems.  Interestingly enough note how rw christians here brag that they are not like muslims and have become more 'progressive' over the centuries. Then they attack the people muslims listen to and tell them there is a better way, etc.   If only they would take their own advice, not listen but think, and continue trying to be more progressive than they used to be. Again, it is funny how they tout how much more progressive their faith has become - slavery is bad now, blacks can marry whites, women can vote, etc - all progressive ideals compared to the backwards way of how they used to use the bible.  The right needs someone to listen to because deep down they know they are wrong and don't like to face that.   That the 20 soldiers/vets who kill themselves a day aren't going to hell.  Fundie conservatives believe that they are (and you can look that up) and religion/hell are popular with them - and their opinion that death by suicide leads to hell is quite popular amongst them  They call the poor, homeless, sick, etc lazy, stupid, weak - even the veterans they claim to care about. But I guess their idea of care is to send them to wars or something.  So, yeah, I guess my view of them will be unpopular to them but it is at least accurate.  Just because a depressed vet (or anyone else) takes their life doesn't mean they will burn in hell forever. I don't care how popular that idea is amongst them, it's stupid.   I have an open hostility towards some in that faith. They want to make their own little 'caliphate' here, I call em the American ISIS. Rule by religion. Kick science out of schools. Encourage discrimination of others out of fear god will punish the whole country (two men kissed? Hurricane!). Control the medical decisions of women and relegate people to praying for healing instead of getting actual health care.  They are sick people who serve mostly money and their own interpretation of some old book - which they will put above their own country.  Dangerous bigots who should be on a watch list.   see my earlier reply. And yeah, a multiparty system would be great. Just like having radio/tv/papers again that weren't owned and controlled by the few. From politics to info the few want to control the many - hence why some were so against net neutrality.   Why does a show have to have a hard political bent? I registered as an independent in 1984, and I have listened to a lot of local shows over the years where the host was pretty open to all sides of things and facilitated discussion instead of trying to overtly control it.  The was licenses are structured now and with consolidation we have lost a lot of local hosts and instead have shows like here on one local station hours of beck, then rush, then hannity, then levin - about 11 hours of rw talk radio on a national level and most of it just fear mongering and distortions.  Oh hey, here is an idea, I could get my own station and start a show, right? No. Big companies have bought up the spectrum here to control and stop competition (same in most markets).   Yes, I have worked in radio (and still do, albeit internet only at the time - though we can broadcast a pirate signal).   Radio has become like politics - run by the few for the few and small, local community radio has been taken away for the most part.   (Pours some gas into his Minn Kota) http://www.politifact.com/personalities/rush-limbaugh/  http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/article/2014/oct/21/pew-study-finds-rush-limbaugh-least-trustworthy-ne/  Or...you could just listen to his show (or hannity, who is worse) and actually think for yourself and you would pick up on these things.   When I go fishing down at the creek I like to putt around in a small 'john boat' (as we call em). I prefer using a Minn Kota trolling motor.  What kind of trolling motor are you using?   Rush blames the Obama's for just about everything. The guy lies and is wrong on so many things I don't know how he stays on the air...except conservatives see him as a preacher and just go on 'faith'.   Some american soldiers murdered people in iraq. They weren't enemies, just civilians.  Believe it or not some people in our military are like that.  There are people who guns who shoot/rob others. Seen them in real life myself, but not in a bagel shop, at a pizza shop.  So...ok. What's your point anyway?   Veteran was wrong in this case.   The old "I am willing to die for your freedoms" stuff wears old when you have someone who is willing to basically steal from protestors over a piece of cloth. Bush walked all over the damned flag with his wars, tsa, patriot act, etc and got cheered on. After 9/11 the right insisted we stand behind him no matter what...benghazi happens and suddenly these same people want to impeach.  The very people who will whine about people walking on the flag are the ones who stood by before saluting the screwing over of our troops. Patriotism isn't a flag you wave or a bible you thump.    The media seems to cover such things a lot, which is fine. But there are laws that expire, need renewed, ones that update rules, etc and so on.   There are a lot of laws that need fixed - from patriot act, tsa, etc to this like this: H.R.41: To temporarily increase the borrowing authority of the Federal Emergency Management Agency for carrying out the National Flood Insurance Program.  Laws don't all have to be new and restrictive and there are enough problems in the legal codes we have to keep congress busy - if they are willing to fix them.   Some laws remove restrictions, some fix problems (VA/etc). Not all laws are made to restrict freedoms but help the government we pay for to run better and change as needed.   I was on it for a short time in the 90's. Was on worker's comp, they lost paperwork, so lost benefits for a time. It was no fun. Food stamps, putting off one bill for one month then another the next.  3 kids, disabled wife (now deceased) who didn't get benefits. Some months we did manage to save a little and got the kids happy meals. It was a huge treat to them but others looked down on us for being 'frivolous'. Long story short, after about 14 months and a hearing before 3 judges I got everything fixed and settlement and went back to work (though I still suffer from the injury, I turned down permanent partial disability so I could work and get out of the system. Still some jobs I can't do.)   Which is a dumb idea. You use less electric that month, coupons, etc...   Thanks for the new information!   So if you save a little each month....oh, wait, if you save a penny you aren't poor enough for conservatives. It means a penny more that the government can use to kill people in other countries.  Message to poor people - don't save a damn dime because if you do it means you aren't poor. You can't save up for anything. So quit suffering each month to try for something you want - it's not christian or american like, you know?   It ain't 'murican to not pray afore eating yer hot dogs and stop everything to grab yer bible and stand still fer da pledge. Git r done!   Ohioan here as well and I would agree. I am sick of driving around the countryside and seeing damn corn and soybeans. Pot would be awesome to see. Keep the pumpkin patches though :)   "We're going to have to have a meeting about all these damned meetings!"   If you read his FB page he is now claiming he is getting death threats for his beliefs and something about a gofundme page. LOL. OK buddy. He is just taking advantage of bigots who will shower him with money.  America. Fuck yeah.   If you notice on his FB page his last post was December. Then on the 14th he posted this crap. Then later on started a post basically saying it wasn't fair he was getting death threats, etc. And set up a gofundme. Sounds like a copycat.   Care to expand on that? I don't dislike religion, it's the followers of it I have problems with (and not all of them).   I am guessing you have never had any issues at all with people using religion to control others via laws/etc?   My concerns are those with power in this country who use their religion to make decisions about laws.   It seems, from your comments, that you don't like religious people all that much either. On that we seem to agree.   Don't know about there, but hope it goes away from here in the US sooner than later.  Fundies are against helping people, non-inclusive, believe people who kill themselves go right to hell (including the 20+ veterans a day that kill themselves). They want America to makes it's laws based on some old book and believe god sends hurricanes/floods/etc to harm america because two men kiss each other (all the while ignoring rape, robbery, murder, suffering of the poor, starving kids, etc...yeah...all god cares about when it comes to sin and the US is gay people.)     A new veterans hospital in Colorado is on track to become one of the most expensive medical centers in the world with a price tag so far of $1.7 billion.  Theres a $100-million-and-still-rising price tag for an atrium and concourse with curving blond-wood walls and towering glass windows,  http://www.abcactionnews.com/news/local-news/i-team-investigates/veteran-says-he-was-repeatedly-put-on-hold-by-veterans-suicide-hotline  It isn't that they can't afford more people to help with the phones, it is that they don't want to.   Yeah, but he was afraid they would end up on hillary's private email server and he would somehow be tied to Benghazi....Everything ties to Benghazi!!11!1!!   Another defeat for fundie bigots. But hey, they can still get pizza in Indiana at their favorite place.   Let me guess, they are conservative and Christian.   *checks article*  Yes, yes she is. You can spot em a mile away on issues from race to gender to sexuality. They are like the US version of isis.   I dunno, must have won though because he changed topic and said he would just downvote everything I posted. Usually, people do/say things like that when they can't continue the argument and are faced with facts.   I think he was mad because he said someone else posted the same thing I did and I got a lot of upvotes on it. When I pointed out some things, and even talked to the other person who posted it and they told me it was obvious I posted it first, he got even more upset.  I don't get some of the drama....Been online since BBS days and, at times, reddit seems worse than the old alt.flame wars :)   I just try to do something I enjoy each day even though I am in a bad situation. I keep it simple - example from my own life:  I used to make a decent living, would drive across country a few times a year. Out of work, car died and junked, have just about nothing materially - but have a place to stay, food, and the internet. Lots to read, learn, etc. It sucks compared to how it once was - but I have a daughter and we play games and have fun each day.  I listen to the radio, watch movies, and am happy each day my daughter isn't ill and in the hospital. I get no govt aid, don't ever have hope of getting a car again and working (hard to do without a car/etc) - but each and every day I see her smile and we laugh.     You can buy a 10 year supply, for one person, of food (freeze dried) for 12k. I would buy a few of those and lock in the rest on a car and a bomb shelter - just in case a republican wins in 2016 ;)   Pretty much no one PM's me. But one guy did, after losing an argument, and said he would follow me and downvote anything I said/posted.   I think he was serious because I post a lot of things in news/politics and even stories that get way voted up get to zero right after I post them it seems...But, meh, not like karma gets you anything.   I still find it funny :) I just post for fun and to discuss interesting things with my fellow humans. If I get more Karma than someone do I win something? What am I missing?   I was at the theater the night it came out. Midnight showing. Only show my dad and I ever went to together (movies just weren't his thing). IIRC I had school the next day but he knew how much I wanted to see it and took me.  Yeah, it was somewhat of a shock. But one of the things that stuck with me was Han and Leia. We didn't know Luke and her were sister/brother (I think I was 14 at the time, no internet, etc). Why was Leia warming up to Han when it seemed like she and Luke would be together?  Heck, I was ok with the whole Luke/Vader thing, thought Yoda was awesome, but why couldn't Luke get the damned girl? Han had Chewbacca, R2 had 3PO, and luke had...well, not leia it seems.  Of course, being a young man my thoughts were with Leia :) And I used to play with my action figures and it always worked out that Luke and Leia were together. Until Jedi...   Over 90% of the terror list is created by Christians in the US.  Weird.   China, the US, Russia aren't really on that list - but they are the ones supplying arms, starting wars, overthrowing governments, supporting regimes.  When you define who is a 'terror' org what does that really mean anyway?   So let me see if I understand this. Hillary has some times to some for profit colleges. Then, instead of giving them (colleges) a pass - she calls them out. Ok.   What am I missing here? Should she have showered them with glowing praise because someone says she has ties to them? Or is that something conservatives expect because when they are bought and paid for they give such things a pass?    	200

I was going to reply that all men want blow jobs for Valentines Day, but this answer is much better    I live in a suburb of Chicago, and our plow drives don't give two shits. They have a schedule to keep and they aren't slowing down to give our driveways a break.  Slightly different subject, but I've seen cars that are under tons of packed snow, slush, and ice.    This.  I already clear my drive way to the right (flow of traffic) and part of the road (so i can get in and out of the driveway), but my driveway is always full of snow again when the plow comes through.    The problem is some people CAN'T get vaccinated, due to being too young, too sick with something else, or allergic.  It's the people that CHOOSE that are putting the people that CAN'T in danger.    That's the point of getting vacancies, so you don't get said diseases.     Do you want to drive in the road with uninsured drivers?    I don't know why, but the last line made me genuinely laugh out loud.    The other day = within the last year   I like how the show seems to be taking a slightly different path than the books.

Lots of people don't know that it's then coolant that also provides the heat.  If your coolant isn't good, neither is the heat.    An O2 sensor is a pretty hardy device, and they don't go bad that often. If you're getting a bad signal from the O2 sensor, it means you have an emissions problem.

How is this person still alive? I'm picturing a person who can't figure out how to get food in their mouth.     Pcp is a hell of a drug.   	53
 Want to spice up microwave popcorn? You'll need   2 bags microwave popcorn. ($1.00) 1/3 cup olive oil ($.20) 1 pack powdered ranch dressing mix ($1.30)  total: 2:50 (6 serving, approx.)  Microwave both bags of popcorn. Mix oil and ranch mix. Pour popcorn onto cookie sheets, drizzle olive oil mix over it. Put in oven for 30 minutes at 250 degrees.  I made this today, was tasty. What're your ways to supe up microwave popcorn?       	1
 Longest headshot or longest headshot on a chopper pilot?   I live in an apartment, alone, in wichita, ks, and if I made even $20,000 a year it would cover everything for me. That would include car, insurance, tuition, rent, food (the highest cost for someone with my appetite), internet, electricity, and phone. Anything more than that and I could freely spend it on anything. Granted my apartment may be a bit drab to some, and I don't drink, and I don't need fancy things to be happy. I'm still shooting for ~100k for my career salary, but that's for financial security.   Your trolling is successful! I don't even play the game, and I still hate you. Keep up the good work!   My apologies, I don't know the rules to reddit, and I'm on my my phone always so I can't read them. What does it matter anyway?    Your fun fact made me sad. That shouldn't be a fun fact..   Was this a parody/joke they were doing for the class? Or were they serious?   Fun fact: The particles that we *smell* are not the same as the actual particles. So smelling poop does not mean there is poop floating in your nose. Reddit taught me that!   Best way to do it is by uploading your image to imgur.com, which is in itself very simple, then paste that link   I'm level 30 and I play *lite* hours, on regular servers. If you play those 1750 ticket metros even 3 or 4 times a week, you'll easily be up there pretty fast, assuming you have some sort of skill.    Like if it rolled on its back and I wanted to tickle its belly, it would slice the flesh off my fore arms. I see..   Well I'd have a conversation. Haha that was my problem. I was always as friendly as I could be, and I was tipped generously for it, but when you wonder why you don't have your drinks yet, it's because you told me the story about how you became the prince of bel air, and I just can't be in two places at once. You just don't tell the customer to their face that you don't have time to talk to them.   Well that is unfortunate. I would really like a lion cub or two to spruce up the apartment, but I'm definitely not trained to handle that. Thanks for the reply!   I saw that post with the picture of the lion cub in the front seat of taco bell guy's car, and had this question. If I raised my own lion cub from birth to adulthood, is it DNA-wired to be a predator? Would it eat birds and my neighbors cats and eventually my annoying neighbors when it is an adult? Or would it only act as I trained it, so it could just be my really frightening looking house cat?   This will sound weird, but please don't try to be my friend if the restaurant is full. I usually had five tables minimum, and if you literally talk to me for five minutes about my life or yours, that's great, but it throws off my entire night, because I keep a flawless routine. Come in later when we are slow if you want my life story, that's when I'm glad to give it   That's entirely personal. People not stacking plates drove me absolutely insane when I was a waiter. The conglomeration of trash and plates spread over the table always took longer to clean then whatever the kind customer did for me. I think it's better for the server to be more flexible in handling what is given to them.   To all current or future Subway employees:  *Coat* the bread rolls in herbs, don't just dip one side in, they're so much better that way.  Proof to about 13", they shrink when they bake.  Always wipe excess cheese off the baking forms, it'll save *literally* hours of cleaning later  Last, bake them so that they're light brown, still visibly green from the herbs, and the cheese isn't burnt. You all suck at this part a lot and the bread tastes awful because of it.  I was a Sandwich Artist at Subway, and I put the art in artist.   This was the answer I was looking for. I figured it was just a mirror of some sort, but I didn't give it a close look, and it looked completely real. Thanks for this.  Edit: Look at the base of the flag for example. How is that being done? That's not a mirrored image, and I don't see any other part of the image that it could have been taken from.   I've never used photoshop before in my life, and I'm 20 years old. I saw [this gif](http://arixev.deviantart.com/art/Diablo-3-Act-2-Wallpaper-How-i-made-it-307916030) today and thought, how is this even happening? Do pictures like the character loading screen have multiple layers, so that you can crop out the character's layer and the background image will exist beyond it? I know photoshop uses layering and other magic like that, but I need more explanation.   I get it! The clown is deaf! Right?? Guys?   Mine forgets where the AC vents are everyday, and when she finally finds them again she gets super excited and decides that she is the only one allowed to have air conditioning after that.   Pretty much any day I would open the freezer door when I first got my husky, she would sit in it at the bottom just like this. She still tries and she is massive   It's the tinfoil-hat comments that make me realize I have no idea what is going on 80% of the time here on Reddit.    http://imgur.com/f0B01  You have negative downvotes, while people usually have positive downvotes.    Excited, excited, EXCITED.  Then you let me down. I'm gonna go with, you say it means nothing so I don't investigate more, and uncover a truth you don't want me to. This isn't over.   I'm new to reddit and the RES as well, but why does your karma say (2|-1)? Is that not the same as (3|0)? What is happening?   I want to downvote you for trying to do something heinous, but I also want to upvote you for possibly actually believing that you would appreciate that more than me.  And, kittensngravy, that would be awesome, but I cannot ask that of you. Thank you anyway!

 I got detention once for simply roaming the hall without a pass. Mind you - there were a dozen other kids doing the same thing at the same time in the same hallway - kids that frequently got in trouble. The dick hall monitor noticed me, a straight-A student, didn't belong there, breaking the rules, and gave me detention. I said something like, "I do all my work and have never gotten in trouble for anything." He said, "I know but YOU know better." Fuck that.   no.   About a month ago I was getting ready for bed at my girlfriend's apartment when I heard her two cats making those weird purring/hunting noises in the kitchen. I was like "Oh shit, there's a mouse." My girlfriend was in her room, so I wandered into the kitchen to subtly investigate. Sure enough they had a small rodent trapped in a corner of the kitchen under an end-table. I kind of just hung out for 5 minutes until they flushed it out. One of them grabbed it in his mouth and before I could react, he shot over to the g/f's room and dropped it on the floor just outside her open door. The SECOND she looked up and saw the cat she knew what had happened (neither of us knowing if the tiny rodent was alive or dead) and screamed, "Ugghhaaahh what does he have?? What does he have??? Get it!!! Please!!" I was laughing so hard at her reaction that I kind of paused then realized, oh crap it might be alive and run into her room. But it wasn't, sadly. I stepped on the poor little mouse to make her feel better but be assured, the kitty had already killed it.   Good. Fuck them.   so cool   Health Care.      That translates to roughly 2 hours a day, every day, for almost 14 years. If that's the case then I'm an expert in staring at cleavage. Nailed it.  	8
 Pomson isn't that bad though, 10% uber is 5 seconds and less than half of an Ubersaw swing. It's more annoying than overpowered. And before Medic mains get mad at me, I too, am a Medic main.   pyro has no mobility.      [Uh huh] (http://wiki.teamfortress.com/w/images/thumb/7/79/RED_Powerjack.png/250px-RED_Powerjack.png?t=20111211011424)    Play Medic so you can heal people, if you wont do it then who will?   I guess I will since I sold all of my Soldier crap for Medic crap.   [Damn right it is.] (http://steamcommunity.com/id/MrLoak/inventory/#440_2_3741638880)   Assuming you do 100 or more damage with both hits, you can.   nanned      My nanny uses the Gunslinger.   Have you two ever traded items? Because if you ever gave him a free item he becomes a kind of free to play to play. It happened to me and a friend of mine, we were doing trading way before we got Premium and when we got the Mann Co Cap from buying something neither of us got the Speks option.   I second this.   [d4nk] (http://i.ytimg.com/vi/u0XAEtHh-L0/maxresdefault.jpg)   Someone told me to post it to truetf2 so I did it.   test_subject7026's Dead Ringer/Cloak and Dagger/Invisiwatch is now rank whatever.      This has gotten me killed a few times and has helped me get kills a few times. Unless you have a Hale's Own, it's not a good idea to use a strange watch.   Can I have that script? I've started playing Medic and I feel like it would help greatly.   If you hit a dude like three times then he Dead Ringers it's believable    test_subject7026's Strange Dead Ringer has ranked up!      Screw you, Valve, now everybody knows I'm a Dead Ringing bastard.      If you have a Strange Dead Ringer, I'd highly recommend that you do some strange leveling for that baby. I sold mine because of it getting me killed two times.      EDIT: Ok so I made a mistake in saying comp because apparently everyone knows if there's a Dead Ringer in pubs, but my point still stands for the other watches.   Spy is a soft counter to everything in this game, his sappers only break your guns if you're not near them or if you're dead. If you're dead then Soldiers and Demos can take it out anyway, and they can kill you easier than a Spy.      I'm speaking from past experience by the way. I've hardly ever had trouble from spies.   I do it when I play CS:GO sometimes :]   I'll do my part and tell you all of my binds from f1 - f9      scout is noob class he runs too fast   soldier is noob class just shoot feet get kills   pyro is noob class just wm1 get kills      demo is noob class m1m2m1m2   heavy is noob class click and hold for bullets   engineer is noob class just hit sentry get kills      medic is noob class don't even kill anyone   sniper is noob class just click on heads get kills   spy is noob class no explanation necessary    Can you pop with the Overdose out? Taking out the xbow is only for when you need a burst of hp you can't do with the Medigun or are at a distance.   Spy is removed, Spy Mains are pissed, everyone else is happy.   That was the intention. There's a reason I have this account.   So I was chilling out in Foundry having a good time when out of nowhere a bullet goes through my head and I'm like "Damn that was a good shot." And then I see who did it and go "That's probably a hacker." I came to this conclusion when I saw the Gibus. I also noticed that he was about 3,000,000 lightyears away from me when it happened, so I spectate him and I see some Sniper gameplay, now I'm gonna admit now that I like hackers. Kinda. I like seeing what they do and how proud they are of it, it's just funny to see the stuff they do sometimes, but being the good guy I am I told the server and the guy says "Nah it was just luck." to which I replied "I know what cheats look like, I know what it looks like to shoot far away from a dude and get a headshot." and he goes on his merry way chanting "Whatever bro".      So we're on Coldfront now, my hands are freezing, my coffee is countering that. And then from across the map like some Robin Hood bullpoop an arrow goes directly into my soul, reaping me of all the enjoyment I had. Now others are starting to talk about it. Things are getting so heated that the snow is melting, I decide to take a few seconds to message a good friend of mine named [Max] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vh1Vo6mLv0g) asking him how he feels about [hackers who deny it when it's obvious] (http://i.imgur.com/eBvudfa.png)      The guy starts to get nervous at this point, almost as if I've spoken to his parents about his poor grades at school. He starts a votekick on me which fails with a final score of 2:14, he tells me that "People hack every day, get over it" and he promptly gets kicked in the nuts by everyone on the server.      So anyway, what are your opinions on the Baby Face's Blaster? Do you think it's OP or just a Side Grade?   I like your name. That's all. I like your name.   how to upclock as sonic from boston   how to do deadclock as french stick   how not die but look die as international businessman   how make pretendsies death as crab man   where to get rich man watch for baguette   how go ghost as danny phantom cosplayer   who give infinite health code to sneaky man   That is the reason I lose 20% of my 5cp matches, I want to change to Spy and sap the nest, I want to sap the 6 Engineers, but we already have 3 Spies. It's so much easier to play the game when the Spies have a functioning mouse.   As a vegan, these kinds of people make me want to drink a coffee and eat a steak with a side of eggs. Also I'd have a can of pepsi because that is a great drink.   I am known to lie from time to time, but when it comes to hats I'm an honest man :]   Exactly, which makes me think he got it from somebody else for some reason. I just have a strange feeling he did. They go for like 4 extra keys if they have any spec kit on backpack.tf but basic ones don't add any value really so buying one with it just seems likely.   Knowing is half the battle      ^^^^^^^^^^GI ^^^^^^^^^^JOE   Granary Mid. I love Granary as a whole, but in MGE if you want to fight me you aren't going to if you want to fight in Granary Mid, I just don't like it.   It's got basic killstreak which makes me think otherwise, I don't know why, it just does.   [Pringle has a bad taste in anime] (http://steamcommunity.com/id/MrLoak/inventory/#440_2_3725312782)   Dude I'm the leader of the Lucky Shot Hot Shots, the reason is that I have an unusual Lucky Shot with, wait for it, Stormy Storm!   And my bow   The worst part is that I forgot why I reset and I played some Mannpower and long story shot I have 500 points as Spy.   Ruined my high score loading menu stats thing. I reset it because I was pretty mad. I had 400 points as Soldier, I know I'm good and all but I'm not *that* good.   /s.   Strange Levels are a direct rip off from Dota 2, proof being that they count things.      That's what my "Inscribed Amulet Gloves of Whatever" do right? Count things and rank up? idk I never played Dota.   How would those even work though?   I also kinda thought it was ping because I don't know about that nerd stuff :]   Lenny faces make someone a 4channer? I better inform all those pink Snipers!   They probably care about this one because Wayne is #6 on backpack.tf and d0 is #50, two rich backpacks will be looked at over the thousand poor ones, I'm afraid.   I'm sure there will be a lobby kind of system like MvM, so playing as a team seems more than likely. :]   If you're on a gambling website and get salty over losing something you've got issues.   I'm not even good      I agree.      It sucks though because they find the delete button and then nobody else can know of such joys!    Unlikeable?

You can survive three without an overheal. I do it all the time.   This was way too long for me to read, and I'll probably read it later, but the one thing I want to say is that you can live three stickies from jumping. :]   Probably something along the lines of "Somebody really wasted $3000 on a livestreamer? What a fucking loser."         I like the speed boost every now and again. It's also what I use in the actual game, I use MGE for practising and improving, I'm not going to use something I don't use in the normal game in MGE.   My Gaming Edge, 1v1 with instant spawns on different arenas, score limit of 20.      Mostly for 1v1s but you can do a 2v2 basketball thing   They are way way better, which is why I don't understand the dude calling it broken, I might add that I was on Granary Mid, a small map where you can't hide and regen.   Sorry I phrased the thing a bit wrong, I meant you can do more depending on the situation, the situation being that the rockets are aimed around the feet and the shotgun is aimed around the chest, I've seen ~100 damage a couple times, and the rocket launcher is a very splash based weapon most of the time, the splash damage does around 80.         The 2 hp per second saved me like twice during the fight, and half of his kills were with the Shotgun anyway.   Imagine someone yelling at a Pyro "THIS MEAT IS SO RARE BOBSPLOSION WOULD BUY IT!"   I personally love the thing (sorry /r/bisonmasterrace) but every now and again on MGE I'll get told that it "ruins MGE" and that the regen is super broken.      I can see how on it's own it gives an advantage, but when they're using a Shotgun I don't see an advantage for me, they have a gun that can do more than the Rocket Launcher and think that the 2 hp per second is broken.      What are your opinions on the Magic Conch?   I would but the guy who gave me them wants to only make profit   Basically, I told my friend that I'd sell his whole inventory for pure and get him exactly what he wants, he game me *150* crates. One hundred and fifty. I can't find any website that will buy them in bulk, do you guys know any sites or people that will?      [This is my inventory right now. Crate city] (http://steamcommunity.com/id/MrLoak/inventory/#440)   Fool I wasn't talking to you, I was talking to the person being all high and mighty, I also looked at their post history, [The first post they have on /r/TheButton was 10 days ago] (http://i.imgur.com/4YsbR29.png) which shows that they most likely did not arrive on day one.   /u/trollabot MommyNurse2012      I hide mine because I am an enigma, wrapped in a mystery, I will tell anyone who asks that I did infact press the button, anybody who wants to know can know that I pressed at 60, and that doesn't make me dirty, that makes me early, I've likely been here longer than you have you dirty grey.   I'm jealous of all of them, mostly the Engineer.   You're like the kid who sits in the back of the class just to say something to prove the teacher wrong.   I see what you're getting at, but potentially there could always be another Burning Team Captain waiting inside that crate #4 you have sitting around, or a Sunbeams Killer Exclusive. Although it is much more likely that you would get the kritz/awp, you will 99% of the time get utter garbage.   I don't think a Strangifier for some weapons would be a great idea, I'm mostly saying this because a Strange Vintage would make the Stranges from earlier be less valued   They're too big for Mom's fridge :[   Thank you for the SFM, and is that a Glengarry Bonnet I see? That was actually the second unusual I got before I cashed out and restarted.   [I suddenly support the idea] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GTzHd1h47o)   Boys, we have a traitor!   Too many greys are going to go for red, hey assholes! Don't press the button! Day one pressers are excusable because we didn't know what was going on, you guys know what it does.   Give the button the sweet release of death!   cunt   I didn't draw them but the dude who did told me the moment he gave them to me that the Heavy and Demo look like trash, he's definitely improved since he did these, I can probably get a picture of his Sniper which is actually much better. Also, who is Medli and can I kill it?   Do you guys want me to do this for the other 8 classes?      Well probably 7, I'm not gonna list "Hudda hudda huh!"    Thanks for the idea.   I always have this fear that I will walk into it and take damage.   Can you remember what this particular post was? Was it a link to his soundcloud?   Speaking of things that include movement speed, do you ever see a BFB Scout going slow and assume it's a Spy? Because I do this way too much.   Ooh, dude you might want to give up on that before you get too far into it, as much as I love the idea of it, I don't think Valve would want a taunt added to the game that removes the Pyro's mask.    Are you the same Smithsonian that dominated like 5 people on a Sawmill game using Loch n Load? The dude who may have been you had an unusual Sober Stuntman, just wondering.   Be a counter to cunt a cunt   It sounds like the MvM spy laugh tbh   I don't   Yes!   I main Soldier because I have 0 skill, I just go on any KOTH map and win. It's not hard.    Then don't use those weapons?   I'd have to say the most fun weapon for me is the Liberty Launcher, combined with the gunboats you take a whopping 85% less rocket jump damage, You can take ~15 damage from 1 jump! It's so much fun to be able to use a damaging Rocket Jumper and a Direct Hit without the splash reduction!      Least fun to use? I'm sorry to the people who like them, but any Sniper or Spy item annoys me and I can't find fun in them, it's such a boring way to play in my opinion, *opinion* being an important word here, I see the value of them on the team and know that they have so much power with 1 shot potential, but I hate playing as/with/against them in every way.

 Fuck that. I didn't even get 3 sentences in. I just got home from college last night. I'm on the toilet reading this with my front door open.   Save me   After watching this movie I did some research about it. Some people actually believe the demon travels through pictures of the box. I read about people warning others to stop sharing the image, because even looking at it can act as a "portal" for lack of a better term. I just thought it was interesting.    It happens to me rather frequently. My first experience with sleep paralysis happened when I was around 6 or 7. I remember "waking up" and feeling very threatened (I apologize for the lack of detail as I was very young). As the feeling progressed, I tried calling out to my brother with whom I shared the room with. I immediately realized that my screams for help were inaudible. Soon after I tried sitting up with no avail. I was lying there helpless, mute, and temporarily paralyzed. It was one of the more frightening experiences of my life at the time. The next vivid case occurred about a year and a half ago. I was asleep, facing my girlfriend when I "woke up" again. This time my sleeping girlfriend's eyes opened slowly and her face became very dark. At this point I realized I was paralyzed again, and this was about the point where the panic set in. She then began to mumble quietly, yet aggressively in an incomprehensible manner (think of a double-voice synonymous with demons? . I felt an immense pressure on my neck as if I was begin stranged. This sensation lasted roughly 15 seconds and abrubtly ended when my paralysis ended, and my girlfriend smiled at me and rolled back over. After doing some research I found out that it happens to people who are under a lot of stress. I am currently an engineering student and know that I am always under a large amount of stress and anxiety.       I actually live outside of North Philly. Thanks for that      That made me so mad when I saw that. That guy was so sad when they shot his dog. I felt horrible.   I do this alllll the time!

  they are hoping for 5-6 seconds a lap which is a massive difference on what they do now   yet another thing they will have to address as well as these changes  people just illegally stream even though the quality is terrible   they may of been leaving for years but it got worse after 2014 the noise is only one part of it  every article i've read on these changes is full of people happy refueling is coming back and that there will be louder cars  people want faster louder cars     you may be happy with it but a lot of people are not, it's more important to draw the fans back that are put off by the current state of f1 and possibly draw new fans in   so many people don't want these changes but guess what the biggest complaints about f1 are slow cars, less noise etc etc  a lot of fans has been driven away from the sport these changes will hopefully bring them back and attract new ones  you can't keep it the way it is especially when track attendance and tv audiences are dropping it's the whole reason they had this meeting in the first place   the entire reason they are bringing this back is a LOT of fans miss the spectacle that f1 used to be  you may think it's for 8 year olds but clearly a lot of people have been driven away from the sport due to the slower cars and less noise or they wouldn't be having this meeting to change the sport  getting those fans back and attracting news one will keep the sport alive not keeping it the way it is and have track attendance and tv audiences die off anymore then it currently is   if  the racing was good they wouldn't of had this meeting to introduce these changes  people are moving away from the sport in droves   a lot of people are no longer interested in F1 these changes could be a good thing and attract more fans to the sport  leave it the way it is and it will die off   they had to take a pay cut a few years back they used to get around 440k an episode   they will probably recast them because that's too many characters to retire you lose a lot of development like lenny+carl smithers+burns bart+skinner  however people are used to what they sound like since they have heard them for over 20 years so suddenly changing voice actors will sound weird   considering what they pay them it's not that bad of a request that they be there when they need them they get over $250,000 an episode   they will probably recast them because that's too many characters to retire you lose a lot of development like lenny+carl smithers+burns bart+skinner  however people are used to what they sound like since they have heard them for over 20 years so suddenly changing voice actors will sound weird    i think Ricciardo is given more credit then he deserves due to last year.. his wins came when Mercedes had problems and safety cars  i want to see him in a good car for a few years to see if he can consistently pull off results like that or if it was just a one off due to special circumstances   i don't like it when you know which team has won the championship 5 races into the season   no one is passing at the front because the teams are so far apart that the only action is in the midfield  f1 won't survive for years and years if this continues   you can since no one has seen gameplay yet and the game is far from being released  even with all the missing features it could still turn out to be a good game   it looks good but i'm just not sure of the timeline  it's weird seeing a Industrial Revolution Assassins creed game with trains etc but i guess after all the others from earlier timelines they had to finally do more modern     f1 isn't going to survive if the only good action is teams fighting for scraps  people want to see a real challenge for the championship not know that one team has already won 5 races into a season because they are so dominant   they have to do something or F1 will die a slow painful death   Mercedes Ferrari and Williams drive in a procession whilst the other teams fight for scraps... that's if red bull torro rosso and mclaren can even finish the race  many other recent years have had better racing then this   f1 has been a procession for years instead of red bull leading it now it's Mercedes  Hamilton Rosberg Vettel Kimi Bottas Massa this has been basically every race so far and likely for the whole season just switch the names around when someone different happens    i know, they need to change it though so they can at least push for a few more laps then they currently can  that way you can still have strategy with tyres but at least get some more racing   the races are getting more boring now with tyre management and DRS  no one pushes anymore because they need to save tyres it takes a lot of the fun out of the sport   they should make the tyres last a little longer then they do not the whole race long but enough so they can push for a few more laps then they can now     he's just as good as Ricciardo   let them leave getting sick of the crying from them... they dominated for 4 years and now want to quit because they haven't got the best car  many other great teams have had bad years before but didn't want to quit because of it  red bull is like a child that just got told it can't have the toy it wants   my opinion is Ferrari is more interested in Bottas than Ricciardo if kimi leaves   i think people are just over the domination by Mercedes.   We just came out of 4 years of red bull to go straight into 2 years of complete Mercedes domination (who knows if the same will happen next year)  at least a few years back after the 2000-2004 Ferrari domination the 2005-2006 seasons was actually close (kimi and schumacher almost winning) then 2007-2009 being different teams winning   seems they are willing to take the risk for some more speed at this rate they will keep getting 6th place or lower   urging Renault to take risks is going to lead to more engine problems but it's not like that matters considering both drivers have almost used up the allocated engines      honestly i hate this track with a passion and if it didn't have the history behind the track it would of been scrapped years ago   qualifying is the only part worth watching for me   Monaco is worse   i thinking Ferrari might be looking at replacing kimi with bottas   the other teams have already improved the cars and some have more updates coming so i don't see it making a massive difference even when they do get the 2015 car..     they are going to need a hell of a lot of funds to do any better the other teams will improve cars for 2016 and leave them in the dust again   they are just there to get in the way of other cars... they always get lapped 3-4 times and are at least 3-4 seconds behind in qualifying times  they have no place in F1 unless they improve significantly which i don't see happening    the pit stop is what screwed him more than anything but the start didn't help   it's time for marussia to leave F1.. 3-4 seconds behind in qualifying and lapped 3-4 times in a race   excuses.. no other team on the "dirty side" had a bad start he screwed up    Hamilton's shit start didn't help him as well as the bad pit stop   Hamilton screwed up at the start and had a shit pit stop vettel didn't ruin anything   don't even know why they are still even in F1 they are a joke   he won't lol if he blows the engine   these streams are like AIDS for me always cutting in and out at the worse times   ouch bad pit stop   he'll screw his tyres if he pushes too much   he had a shit start   button sounds drunk every time he makes a radio message   thanks seems like a good one   any decent streams going almost all of them are screwed   this will get downvoted to hell but Raikkonen is overrated and Ferrari is wasting money on him   it's basically been used for marketing so in a way it's disrespectful even if someone from the family approved   not the same as putting them on stage in front of a audience as a hologram especially when it's about marketing  	54

THIS FAGET PIECE OF SHIT HAS ALREADY GRACED THIS PAGE FAGET   Repost   I feel like I saw this the other day...   One of my favorite movies too. The first time I watched it, I got so scared and paranoid that I would religiously check every window and door plus any possible entry ways every night for an entire week.   Now, who's to say these men are gay? A real gay man would never look this terrible. They're obviously straight.   I know your feels bro   Fake dummy of Sigourny Weaver from one of the Alien movies maybe   Having your foot too close to the side because it has the potential of getting caught perhaps   Tommy Defendi (guy on far left) is one of my top fantasies.

That guy sucks at catching and keeping his brides." But still, I'm glad you made the reference. :D   My heart. These feels. Sigh...   Please tell me they actually said that on television.   Sometimes I just want to say "Free? You just made it $5 more expensive."

WHAT   Congrats! I just lost my virginity this past September on my birthday.   FUCK OFF WITH YOUR NO CAPS SHIT   WHAT ABOUT YOUR CAPS LOCK FAGET   Very cool. Thanks for sharing.   4chan beat you by days.   Someone said it but *hearse   I just got told that. Sorry about it.   Sorry about that. But a simple "hey this is a repost" would've sufficed you fucker.   I hide requests and other stuff so I only get statuses and important life events but they slip in and then I think of the other people they're friends and ask "Do you think the other people like to see that stuff either?" Answer is no.   I do that too but there's some people I actually like to keep in contact with so I just ask them to stop. They usually do.      Inconceivable   Aw, you're so sweet!   Oh ok. Thanks!   It's a pig *gosh you guys*   Oh my god, I'm so butthurt. Let me go swig some bleach because I can't take your bullying. I'm so depressed because you said bad stuff about me.   *I do my best*   Some of the comments are racist? That's outrageous..   *drool*   If he doesn't look directly at me, I'd do him morning noon and night.   GET THIS SHIT OUT OF HERE YOU FUCKING FAGET   You really should. Fantastic movie. Long but worth your time.   By proving that they shopped it to be a half a foot longer than what it is? Innovative. You'll go far here.   I was just born. How am I typing?   What do you gain with this? A sense of accomplishment in falsifying the post and hoping to get karma from it like the fake artist girlfriend poster? Original or not, that alligator is still rather large. This does nothing.   Common thing in local Mexican restaurants here in South Texas.   Always   There's a picture somewhere of them blowing a guy. Just google it, you'll find it.   It doesn't matter. But if a white guy does that, it's all over the news and he's a racist.   There are plenty if guys, gay and straight, who have nice handwriting.      Bitch stole my wig   Does OP have a problem with it or OP just jealous and amazed?   PETA this and PETA that. PETA bullshit, PETA PETA PETA.   It was one of my favorite books as a kid. And my favorite childhood snacks.   No hope left.   It was nice most of the time. We'd get into little fights but we got over them quickly and everything was good. And being big and not getting guys that often, I have to go for guys that fetishize fat guys. Sometimes it gets creepy. I don't want someone who wants me because I'm a big guy and that's what they like, all those people do enable guys like me to get bigger. I'm trying to shrink, not grow. I want someone who is going to support me in weight loss. I would talk to my ex about it and I asked what would you do if I lost weight and it was a considerable an he literally said he wouldn't be with me anymore. I need to get away from the fetish. But sadly, it probably won't happen. I have to get skinnier before I can find that.    It's hard to seperate things because a lot of things I do on a daily basis or some of my mannerisms remind me of him a lot. Things I say, thing I think of just scream out and it just gets me down. My self esteem has always been an issue for me because I'm a fat guy, and I'm trying to change that. It's hard work but I'm trying. He brought me up and then when he said he didn't love me anymore and broke up with me over the phone, it destroyed my confidence.   *things I will masturbate to   Seriously? Go back to your PETA headquarters and take a piss shower while you're at it.  	79
 lol I went internet only some time ago. Really, pretty much anything is out there. I finally bowed to the pressure of the non-techs in the house and got me some Dish Network. The woman can dvr whatever, it's her's.    Cool, it made the store, thanks for the tip.    More than you'd think. NetFront Life Screen, Rocket Launcher, SPB Shell, and Launcher 8 are the first that spring to mind.    When installed, did you go into your phone's settings  applications, find your app, clear defaults, data, etc? When unistalled, did you search for any associated folders and files saved on your phone ?    What, the list? Since the list has gotten so large and launchers have become more common I now watch the Play Store and check out all the new apps coming through, keep my eye on xda, periodically Google around, and listen to what people point out. It used to be updated every month or two, but I got tired of spending hours and hours at a time updating. Now I spend just a few minutes every day or two seeing what's new or what I've missed. I've also followed a suggestion to post the updates recently.    It has face recognition also, though I haven't played with it yet.    Now, I'm not sure if it has a limit to the number of previous episodes available or not. I just know I wanted to listen to How to Succeed in Evil (liking it a lot btw) and with 70+ chapters, the other podcast apps wouldn't let me start at the beginning. So I know Podkicker lets me go back at least that far.    So I can have access to more than 30 or however many previous episodes. I couldn't start at the beginning of a long podiobook. Podkicker doesn't give me that limitation.    I used them both, and prefered PocketCasts. But I could only download so many episodes. Since I also wanted to use my pod player for Podiobooks books (which can have tons of chapters) I use Podkicker now.   Really, they are all very similar.   I posted this before, but it's gotten huge since then. It's now organized by minimum Android version needed to make it easier to navigate and find something you like.   http://androidforums.com/showthread.php?p=3133690 The Big List of Home Launchers - March 22, 2013 (237 and counting...)    Just looking around for other game clients that are worth looking into. I know of Games for Windows and Origin, but that's about it. Am I just not finding really good game clients or is Steam pretty much the only good one?   It is 100% wrong that I can buy a product that doesn't work, though is claimed to work, and the seller doesn't need to refund, fix, exchange, or make any kind of effort to resolve it other than shrugging their shoulders and saying "look around, maybe you kind find a way to fix this broken thing we sold you."

But you sold me an unplayable game. Doctor Who: The Eternity Clock has a glitch that won't allow me to pass a certain point in the game, a point none too deep I might add. I read the forums (I'm not the only one who has the glitch), attempted to contact the makers (never did respond), and have spent hours trying to get by it randomly (did once, but died immediately afterwards and got sent to the beginning of the level again, never could repeat getting past the glitch). All was for naught.  So in the end I was sold, by you, a game that cannot be played. Or at least, can only be played up to a point (London Underground II) and cannot be completed. May as well call it a demo that can only be played a few levels in.  As such, I can't see how it would be possible that I wouldn't be due a refund. I've uninstalled and re-installed the game (which didn't help), and have once again uninstalled it for good.   2 Message by you on Sun, 2nd Dec 2012 9:50 pm BTW, if you have a fix for the game, I would be eternally grateful and would accept that in lieu of a refund.   3 Message by Support Tech Wiktor on Tue, 4th Dec 2012 5:56 pm Hello Scur,  Thank you for contacting Steam Support.

Steam Subscriber Agreement http://store.steampowered.com/subscriber_agreement/   Please send me a copy of your conversation with this third party support team, which outlines what steps youve taken to try to get the game working on your computer and I will investigate this matter further.   7 Message by you on Fri, 7th Dec 2012 11:31 am I told them the same things I told you, essentially. Not much more to add. They still haven't contacted me, and I still paid you, Steam, for a game I can't play. In what world are you living in which that can't possibly be one of the few exceptions where you must provide a refund?   8 Message by you on Fri, 7th Dec 2012 11:40 am I have 185 games so far on Steam.

Please contact this support team and attempt to troubleshoot the issue you are experiencing.  Please send me a copy of this conversation with the third party support team, which outlines what steps you have taken to try to get the game working on your computer and I will investigate this matter further.   10 Message by you on Tue, 11th Dec 2012 9:47 am ...did you even read my original statement? I HAVE attempted to "troubleshoot my issue with the third party support team," but they will not respond after repeated attempts to contact them. I cannot force them to respond. Apparently you are privy to some secret method of making someone sit down and writing an email.  So I guess the dollars you've accepted from me in the past will have to suffice for the total amount you will ever receive from me. I will continue to use steam and play the games I've paid for, but you will NEVER see another cent from me again.  Thanks for nothing.   11 Message by you on Tue, 11th Dec 2012 10:05 am Oh, wait.

I'd like him/her to see that you didn't even give my responses a cursory glance.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  So in my aggravation with Wiktor, I called him a dimwit. I'll apologize in my final response to him, then close the ticket since he isn't interested in even reading anything.  So can you tell me, where do I stand? Steam just sold me a game I can't play or get any kind of support or response from the third-party developer, and now keeping my $8.99 with a "Sorry we sold you a game that has a glitch that won't let you play it, or get help with fixing, but we're going to keep your money."  I really do have a crap-ton of games on Steam (granted, the bulk of my items aren't the high-dollar new games but games bought during sales), and have never had this kind of trouble with Steam before. I would gladly continue to purchase games from Steam if we could resolve this, but the developer won't help or even respond, and it seems that Steam isn't very interested in anything except pointing their finger to the deaf ears of the devs and saying "I know we took your money, but take your problems up with them."  2 Message by Support Tech Rudy on Thu, 13th Dec 2012 2:49 pm Hello Scur,  Thank you for contacting Steam Support.  I'm sorry you are having an issue with this game.   When did you contact the third party support team?  If they have not responded to your original ticket, I would suggest creating a new support ticket with them. It is possible the ticket has been lost in their system.   They will be able to assist you in resolving the issue.  3 Message by you on Thu, 13th Dec 2012 4:49 pm  I emailed support 3 times. Can you please just refund my money? It's become obvious that no help is coming. As I said before, I really don't want to have a falling out with Steam over $8.99, but I can't just allow myself to be ripped off like that by a corporation, as in paying for a product that doesn't work and to be refused a refund, a fix, or a replacement. I'm stubborn like that.  4 Message by Support Tech Raymond on Sat, 15th Dec 2012 4:35 pm  Hello Scur,  We do not offer refunds or exchanges.  Our records indicate that you have played this game for nearly ten hours, effectively using the license.  At what point in the game does the glitch occur?   Have you tried the community discussions/forums for help?  5 Message by you on Sun, 16th Dec 2012 2:41 pm  I played for 10 hours trying to get past the glitch. I didn't just hit a wall and demand a refund. I put in a LOT of time, as in hundreds of attempts, to get past the glitch. It is during the London Underground II level. When I boost River up the second wall, she's supposed to reach down and pull the Doctor up, as she would any other wall. Instead she just jumps down to follow me.  Yes, I've hit the forums. Others have found this glitch, and no one knows a way to get past it.  So I have an unplayable game. Thanks for the info that you will do nothing except keep my money. I can now officially say that you've seen my last dime, and any new games I buy in the future will be through some other means. I will continue to use the games I've already bought from you in the hopes that every time I play a multi-player it will cost you some small bit and you'll never ever receive any more compensation for it from me.  Again, thanks for being the giant conglomerate that cares more about 9 bucks than, up until now, a dedicated customer. Don't send me any more rationalizations for your greed, please, it just increases my ire.  6 Message by you on Mon, 17th Dec 2012 4:21 am  Here at a later time, I'm re-reading this conversation and realizing I didn't play anywhere near 10 hours. Maybe I left it on or something, but I played an hour or less when I hit the glitch, and I know I spent more time than that off and on trying to get past it. Not that it changes anything or that you folks care or anything. Just putting that out there.  7 Message by Support Tech Raymond on Mon, 17th Dec 2012 6:38 pm  Hello Scur,  Can you provide a link to some of these forum discussions showing the issue?  8 Message by you on Tue, 18th Dec 2012 3:05 am  They're your forums, I'm not doing any more leg work. I've washed my hands of Steam, keep the nine bucks for all I care.  9 Message by Support Tech Raymond on Tue, 18th Dec 2012 10:15 pm  Hello Scur,  Please feel free to reply or reopen this ticket when you have the necessary information.  10 Message by you on Wed, 19th Dec 2012 3:26 pm  Necessary for what? For you to continue telling me you won't help me in any way? What possible reason can I have to continuing this conversation? It's obvious Steam will do absolutely nothing about the faulty product that they sold to me, except pushing me to find my own answers about possible solutions to the glitch. Am I wrong?  11 Message by you on Wed, 19th Dec 2012 3:30 pm  I am so utterly disappointed in Steam, so instead of fruitlessly looking for solutions that don't exist or trying to get any sort of resolutions from Steam, I am going to spend my efforts in showing everybody that I can what kind of company Steam really is when the chips are down. I think Reddit is a good starting point.      Yup, GrooVe IP for me too. I'm always around WiFi, got tired of that Verizon bill since becoming a cord cutter.    I'm looking for alternative to the Google Voice app to text with my Voice account. I don't keep service on my phone, only over WiFi these days, and found that the Google Voice app isn't really the best. Sometimes texts won't show up in the inbox, only in the text box, so I'm not alerted. Any one know of maybe a mms, sms, or IM app that can work with Voice without service and only use WiFi? Or even some ideas? I haven't found anything yet.   lol I guess I stand corrected. That's a nice-looking home screen.   Different:  Claystone Launcher  Hi Launcher  NetFront Life Screen  Rocket Launcher  SPB Shell 3D  ssLauncher  TSF Shell    I have 14 monks that are buying Smartphones off of me.  Another sentence I would have never believed that I would hear.   [Advanced Pro Widgets](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.rdr.widgets.core feature=search_result#?t=W251bGwsMSwxLDEsImNvbS5yZHIud2lkZ2V0cy5jb3JlIl0.) are great if you do a lot of socializing on your phone.   While I agree that Task Killers aren't the best way to go, my Androids have always had memory and lag issues until I fiddle with the minfree values. I don't have a newer phone anymore, and I hear that Android has gotten better about memory management, but the GB phones I have now all have issues until I use AMM or V-6 Supercharger on them. I like lots of tools and system apps though that like to take up memory. When I restore apps on a fresh GB ROM, my phones all lag until I make adjustments. Stock GB just doesn't handle them well. Without those adjustments, I can easily see why task killers are so popular.   I saw that featured in an Android article somewhere recently. Seems fine for women, but for guys? Meh...   I do that while I'm waiting for my inrupublic invite to come. I use GrooVe IP for phone calls over WiFi and Google Voice for texting. That way I can still use my Google Voice number for everything and on my new phone, too.   Also Android Community, Android and Me, Android Atlas, Android Guys, Talk Android, Androinica, AndroidPIT, IntoMobile, AndGeeks.  I use Pulse to view feeds lately, and those pop up in addition to the aforementioned.   Reversed tethering and a WiFi hotspot are the 2 apps you need. xda probably has them. Or you could just take a router with you.   I remember someone on some forum, xda maybe, who wanted to have something like that. Reversed tethering, I think he called it. So you just need reversed tethering and a hotspot app. I would search the forums for those 2 things.   [Here's a youtube comparing them against each other.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdU4jFmUGtA)   I used an app from the ap store, don't remember the name. But I just searched for "remove contacts" and poked through the results until I found something that looked good and would perform batch functions.   On my revue I'm mostly watching Amazon (I have Prime), Crackle, and Project Free TV.   Yeah, gratz on the first post, ignore the trolls with the low self-esteem.   Gratz! It's all uphill from here. :)   In today's world? As opposed to what, the dark ages?  Raising a child is a joyous responsibility I guess. My daughter is a part of me, so my life is just bigger. Sure it's life changing, but it's not life ending. If you're ready for a kid, have one. If not, then don't. You're over-thinking the whole thing, I think.   FWIW, as you'll discover in the Revue's browser, most of the major US broadcast and cable networks deliberately block access to their streams from Google TV devices. They don't like Google.  That's why I use the Clicker and Spotlight apps. They point you to streaming sites that allow GTV. And I have a HD antennae to watch local channels (albeit rarely). I was just hoping someone had some great free streaming sites or apps that I haven't yet. So far, Crackle is pretty much the only decent free site for streaming movies.   Bit on the dangerous side. :)  I've done a ton of geotech drilling all over south of 395 between South Capitol and 12th SE, so there are a lot of plans for knocking down older buildings and putting up new stuff that they haven't even started yet.   Did you ever notice that the lights on 7th sync at different times? I've made it all the way from Constitution to Silver Spring without stopping a few times after 4 pm.   It's kinda pathetic. Hardly anything there. Baltimore Aquarium is the one to visit. If you can survive the drivers, that is.   Link isn't working. For me, anyway.   I learned the hard way that one should *always* skip the National Aquarium in the Hoover building.   I recently ditched cable (live in small town, WAY overpriced) and went to just internet. So far I use Avia w/ Logitech Media Server to play anything on my computer, and it works fine. But as far as streaming, what are your options? So far I use Amazon Instant Video and Netflix, have a bookmark on my home to Crackle, and use Clicker and Spotlight apps from time to time to find other stuff. What sites/apps haven't I found yet?   I have a Revue, so I use a few apps to find stuff. Amazon Prime covers most of Netflix, so I dropped Netflix. Clicker and Spotlight are decent apps to find GoogleTV friendly channels. Cracked actually has quite a few decent movies, and it's free. Hulu won't play on Google TV, though, and I haven't found a free way to stream online content from my puter to my Revue yet. Avia will stream all my videos and whatnot from my hard drive, though.   I spent 7 yrs in NoVA and still didn't hit all the museums on the mall.   That I raised an awesome girl.   It was Detroit PD at first, but if there was any kind of evidence that suggested another state was involved, it would become federal. (best guess)   EAZY!   Perhaps a button at the top to open/close it? It would be nice to not have it taking up so much screen space.   Well, when I go to /r/Android in my normal Chrome, there's a big list of links in the right-side bar. How will it show that bar?   SwiftKey is my favorite, too. The predictions are awesome. And I went through the options to get it to behave as I liked.    The old market app downloaded and installed as many at once as they could.  The new play store app will put them in a queue. It will download one, then it will install it. While it's installing the first app, it will download the second app. If the app is finished downloading before the first is finished installing, it will wait for the install to finish. It won't download a third app until the second one begins installing. So it will only  do 2 things at any time: download a single app and install a single app.   I've become a fan of "Fast for Facebook" myself.   The reason why Google apps aren't included with CyanogenMods is because they aren't allowed to include Google apps with the custom mods. Copy-write laws and all that. So Google apps (gapps) must be installed separately.   Sigh.., it's neither of those.   Not a rock, but yes, [it's alive](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyura_chilensis). Or was.   Yeah, I just tried it. 15 mins later everything was uninstalled.   WTF. I had mine still within warranty when it slid off the couch. Fell less than a foot and a half onto a carpeted floor, and broke the screen. They told me they wouldn't help me.   Nice looking widgets, but I keep those in a toggle bar in my dropdown. Much handier place to keep them, imo.  I do like that WiFi widget, though. Good idea.   So what's up with this, is it a nice setup?   My X2 has a HDMI port, so when I wasn't using it it sat next to the TV and streamed video (damn you, Hulu!) and my Ascend was given to my 8 yr. old daughter with GrooVe IP so she has her own phone as long as she's within WiFi.   That's how I feel about heights. When I was a kid I climbed trees and jumped from branch to branch like a monkey. Now if I try to, say, climb a ladder to the roof, by the time I get to the top I'm almost paralyzed. It's a horribly nerve-racking feeling. It doesn't matter how badly I want up there, it's just completely beyond my control.   I used it and really liked it, but there was some limitation (that I can't remember now) that kept me from using it like I wanted to.   Well, almost. I find it more enjoyable to manage my phone than actually use it. I love fiddling with it, and have been know to flash half a dozen times in a day.  	62
 They're just so peaceful.   This is what happens when people on the government dole are allowed to vote.   He tried to tax everything that moved in Maryland and it failed miserably.  We need someone who understands that businesses create prosperity and a welfare check doesn't.      Title is misleading.   "Rohl, Dents attorney, contends that a close review of a video released this week shows Melendez pulling a bag of drugs from his pocket."  So his attorney contends this.  Where is the video?   Good for Indiana.  If I start a business, I should be able to decide who I do business with.  This whole politically correct mandate from the left is an obtrusive overreach.  We are free citizens not subjects.      The Democrat Party would have you believe that evil like this doesn't exist anymore.  They are naive and dangerous in any position involving national security.            Iran will kill millions of innocent civilians when they obtain a nuclear weapon.  War will rage across the Middle East, Europe and possibly further.  But who cares?  We have a cool, mixed president and aren't racist and stuff.         When you funnel money through any government program, this happens.  After hundreds of billions of dollars of tax money, why are private schools still better than public? They operate on their own money so there is much more accountability and incentive to perform.   Except 50 cent wasn't shot with an AK-47.   Because nothing measures pure success in life quite like a great "Reddit track record".   Contrary to what they would have you believe, the Democrat party is really a party of elitism.      If you stacked the entire 2015 Department of Education budget in new one dollar bills it would reach from Los Angeles to New York....and back.  Do you think further increases of funding are going to  a) increase our students' performance or   b) line the pockets of "administrators" and bureaucrats?   We already spend **HUNDREDS OF BILLIONS** of dollars on the Dept of Education.  It is a collosal failure and a demonstration of the inadequacies of central government bureaucracy.  We won two world wars without the DOE.  We put people on the moon without the DOE.  We invented the Internet without the DOE.  What have we done since the DOE?  We've sank to the lowest level education-wise of all first world countries.   Abolish the DOE and give control of education back to the people.  We'll be just fine without it and billions of dollars richer.   Obama snuggling up with Iran.  Does he have to make it any more obvious?  He has never said one good word about America  and praises Islam every chance he gets.  The emperor is wearing no clothes.      Is your idea of a perfect government one in which everything is provided for you?  Because that doesn't make for a free society.   But...the Republicans!  The link I sent has **65** references. Did you even read it?   Liberals of reddit:  Why are you okay with Elizabeth Warren lying about her Native American ancestry?  http://elizabethwarrenwiki.org/elizabeth-warren-native-american-cherokee-controversy/   If you think more funding makes a government program successful, please point your eyes to the Department of Education.      Humble pie.      Proof?  Have you been in a cave for the last 10 years? Do you really understand the state of Europe right now due to substantial populations of unassimilated extremists from the Muslim world?   Politically correct cowards of Reddit, put your heads back in the sand and keep telling yourself that the true evil in the world comes from white, Western capitalists.       These things are inseparable from massive, centralized government programs. We will learn this the hard way.   Bureaucracy? Red tape? Queueing? Rationing? Inefficiency? All while our masters in Washington don't live under the same rules?  Yes we can!         I should be able to decide who I do business with, if I'm a consumer **or** business owner.    Put an amateur in charge, get amateur results.      Get these clowns out of the White House.      Who cares how much it is?  Why would we put elites in charge of determining if you are allowed to keep your own money?   But putting the federal government in charge of the entire health care system makes perfect sense. /s   It was so horrible, he was allowed by the Taliban to carry a weapon.   You mean Republicans think when you die and leave your stuff to your children, it shouldn't be taxed?  What a horrible idea. /s   What is wrong with his wife working at Goldman Sachs?  Maybe we should put everyone in the finance industry in prison and have Obama's people run the entire industry?  /s    http://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2014/12/shock-report-us-paid-5-billion-released-5-taliban-prisoners-for-deserter-bergdahl-video/   Do you think Obama will ask the Taliban to give back the 5 BILLION he gave them?   It's ironic that someone with thousands of dollars of tattoos is flying across the world to threaten third world people that are driven to poaching simply to feed their families.   Why don't you go first?   Because a corporate tax rate of 40% will not create economic growth or jobs.   Why should I pay a higher percent of my income simply because I make more money?    The progressive tax system is in obvious violation of the fourteenth amendment.  A different law is being applied to someone simply because they make more money.  Everyone should pay the same percent of their income.   TIL: Freedom is historically toxic.   Desperation is a stinky cologne.   Republicans take money from rich Americans --- outrage  Democrats take money from rich foreigners ---- crickets   Leave it up to Washington Post to attack a victim of attempted murder for political gain.   Guaranteed their parents are unassimiliated immigrants who don't give a shit about American sacrifices or traditions.   It is currently the longest period without a hurricane hitting the mainland US in recorded history.   The dispute is not that the earth is warming.  The dispute is whether humans are causing it.   Not when you consider they were *all* in custody at one point.      Obama did say he would "stand with the Muslims".  That's the only promise he's kept.   I'm looking forward to having someone back in the Whitehouse that values integrity.   "The U.S. has accepted two new immigrants for each additional job created since 2000"  Third world status?  Yes we can!        I'm sure your plan doesn't cost $400.  Your employer is paying the rest.   My family's health plan now costs $2200 a month.   How is this good for me?     The same way Obama became President.  http://tinyurl.com/nzxvlur   Play stupid games, win stupid prizes.      1939 take two?  Yes we can!      Many conservatives are ex-liberals.  There are almost no liberals who are ex-conservatives.  Why?  Liberalism is largely based on ignorance of the realities of the world.  Once one learns these realities, they abandon the naive idealism of progressivism.   Eggcellent   And Obama golfs on.      Obama has vowed to find the evil, white Tea Party members responsible.      A campaign donation is far different than a payment to an elected official.  If our citizens think it's okay for the Secretary of State to run a charity that accepts donations from foreign governments then we are in trouble.      He was just murdering the women that Americans wouldn't murder themselves.   All prosperity in our nation comes from the private sector, through the 'evil' employers. Your god, the state, does not create any jobs, drive innovation or provide a sustainable path for people to leave poverty.  Government does not produce economic growth, private business does.   Vacations and pensions are benefits, not rights.   You're right.  John Kerry siding with America's enemies is not news.    This, along with the proposed 75% income tax, will definitely attract more business!  /s      The Kurds did in fact greet us as liberators.         The federal government has no business defining and regulating "political activity"  Power corrupts.   Obama supporters: You wanted big government? You got it.     	92

 /r/delusionalartists would probably like this  Edit: nevermind.    We also like to verb nouns.   I just cannot do the Misfits. I can't explain why.

I feel like I've seen this video here multiple times in the past few weeks. I may be wrong, though.   Well, I can't explain them to you! I don't know what they are, either!   If you go to /r/bitcoin, there's lots of info there.   Don't need none'a that here!   I may have gone a little overboard...      I was seriously thinking it was the one I usually go to.... But your comment has made me second guess myself.   Every now and then I find myself wondering what it would be like if we just ejaculated one big sperm. It keeps me up some nights.   My neighbor's sister rear-ended somebody.... On her way out of the dealership.   When she was really young, my sister cut her hair on only one side of her head and then tried to walk past my mom and go to a friends house. She tried to play it off as her "falling" when my mom stopped her.   Yeah, but, ya know.... Fuck that.   KoTOR has to be one of my favorite games of all time! I've had it for years and only just finished it for the first time a few months ago.   Thank you!      Sex. I really don't care.   You realize how dark those movies really were, later on... And it's so fucked up.   Which Flashpoint is it, exactly?   I almost never use the Masterball out of fear that I'll need it some other time...   Why does religion always have to be cited as an enemy of science? The group that doesn't believe in these things is in the minority. You're being just as closed-minded as they are.   I don't know about trading, but you can sell at the LS Customs.   Swamps of Dagoba is a fucking masterpiece.   Well, there's all this philosophy about whether people are inherently good or evil. It's all perception and not really an answerable question.   I fucking loved this video in drivers ed and can't forget it.   That game has been and will remain in my top 5 forever!   *Karmanaut*   You are Karmanaut   I've been using an old piece of paper as a mouse pad for around a year, now.

The seller has been killing everyone that they have sent the camera to and taken a picture.   I realize that it's not common at all, but I am currently learning about the stock market in American high school.   Oh, I didn't know that. Thanks!   I'm a pretty big fan of the Prius plugs on Bones.   The closest one is probably the Ruiner and that's pretty loose.   Do you have to keep putting cars back into the garage (mainly the 4 car ones)? I've noticed that if I took one out and didn't put it back in or it got destroyed, it would no longer be saved in the garage. This happened 3 times (once in franklin's/aunt's house garage, once in Trevor's 4-car garage, and once in michael's 4-car garage) and I'm wondering if it's a glitch or the game is supposed to be like that.   You *know* Rockstar would put that in, too.   It is a country, isn't it?   As someone who isn't even halfway through, yet.... Oh, my fucking god.    I'm pretty sure that's what happens when they grow up in too small a space.    It's 3 flavors of sugar in layers.    ITT Risky clicks everywhere.   I'm sure you could put it on the nexus.

Because they're actually a communist propaganda manufacturer.  Edit: as well as the letter Z and the number 20. Those are tools of communism.   CoD4 has a HUGE PC player base.

I think what you're talking about is the guy that kept a journal of everything he did in Skyrim. It actually really helps with immersion if you like writing, at all.   You should check it out. It's really good! It's called the Titan EP.   Have you heard their new EP?   Somebody make a subreddit just for these videos. Now.   I thought people liked that movie, am I wrong? I haven't seen it yet, so I don't know any of this.   Still haven't seen a show better than these guys.      The Unfinished Swan is a really cool indie game.   As a teenager, fuck them.   I finished that game for the first time since buying it years ago.... And it felt great.   Simultaneous isn't bad.    I definitely didn't play the third one to see the ending. I really wanted to see how my decisions in the second game affected the third game.   Oh, my god. Fuck those guys.   I got to have the rare experience that is a wall of death in a 150-200 person venue. It was... Odd, to say the least.  	91

 I run a fun, small subreddit: /r/SummerScavengerHunt. Every year on June 1st we share a scavenger hunt list. Participants post photos and videos of themselves finding items or completing tasks from the scavenger hunt list (last year's list can be found in the sidebar) and then the moderators award points to your team if the submission meets the criteria (teams can be one or two people).   Here are some of the items people submitted for last year's scavenger hunt:  [#89 A drink with a phallic name that isn't Bawls](http://i.imgur.com/Lnmg5mh.jpg)  [#142 Someone in a banana suit](http://i.imgur.com/3x3JG8Z.jpg)  [#165 A banknote with a denomination larger than 1,000,000](http://i.imgur.com/K5fmlLE.jpg)  [#202 Make a pair of ice skates by attaching ice to the bottom of your shoes.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaXsKrmg4io feature=youtu.be)  [#260 Feed an animal (besides a human) a carrot out of your mouth](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_qerX9uuK0 feature=youtu.be)  It would be great to have some more participants this year, so please join in the competition!      There would be about 18% less GHG emissions, substantially less water usage, lower rates of heart disease, far less risk of antibiotic resistant bacteria evolving and killing people, fewer [dead zones](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_zone_%28ecology%29), fewer dangerous algal blooms.   There would be a lot of major global consequences if the world was filled entirely with people like you.                                                         That's awesome news! What got you to start looking into the issue just a few hours ago? What did you see/learn that changed your mind?    deontological  I'm more of a consequentialist actually   [If this guy can be vegan with his metabolism, I think yours can handle it too](http://veganworkout.org.pl/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/941424_4174963751044_813804607_n.jpg)   Is there any other ethical question where you say, "if you're able to commit the action yourself then that makes it okay?" That seems really out of line with how most people feel about other ethical issues.   A century ago when orangutan populations were relatively undisturbed there were roughly 230,000 in the wild. Today roughly 50,000 remain. [Source](http://wwf.panda.org/what_we_do/endangered_species/great_apes/orangutans/)  Even for the production of vegan foods it is likely that many millions of animals every year lose their lives. It is tragic that any animals die, but palm oil is not unusually harmful to animals compared to other foods we have available.   You don't get to just be ethical some of the time when it is convenient or when you feel like it. Being ethical means evaluating all of your choices and considering how your actions impact others.   An ethical person also isn't someone who just considers how their actions impact certain groups that they deem worthy. In order to be ethical you need to consider the impact your actions have on all others. There is no reason why that should only include humans.   Oh, vegan diets are by no means an anti-keto diet. There are actually large communities at /r/vegetarianketo and /r/veganketo. I was just trying to show that the healthfulness of vegan diets is backed up by solid evidence.    Nobody cares about the most "ethical" diet either.  What? Everyone should care about making choices that are ethical.   And unlike keto diets, vegan diets have support from mainstream dietary organizations and experts:  **[American Dietetic Association](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19562864)**   It is the position of the American Dietetic Association that appropriately planned vegetarian diets, including total vegetarian or vegan diets, are healthful, nutritionally adequate, and may provide health benefits in the prevention and treatment of certain diseases.

You were "vegan" [here](http://np.reddit.com/r/news/comments/31n10f/federal_report_vegan_diet_best_for_planet_a/cq5mmc4) and [here](https://np.reddit.com/r/aww/comments/2y0oj5/sharing_an_apple/cp5hoqg). Why don't you ask yourself?   India is doing very well in terms of health compared to countries with a similar GDP per capita. Obviously they aren't going to be as healthy as a much wealthier nation that can afford far better health services.    Just like all those rich vegetarians in India - all marching down to buy whatever expensive foods they want from their local Whole Foods /sarcasm  The world's poor rely upon cheap staples like rice, beans, and cassava that are all vegan. Meat is considered a luxury by most people on this planet. You need to be completely out of touch to think not eating meat is only for rich people.   I clicked on both of your links under the header "vegan children don't grow normally". One of them studied vegetarian children and said their height was within the normal range. The other was about macrobiotic diets.    Did you give up on pretending to be vegan?   That's unfortunate that your wife is struggling with anemia. Clearly her current meat heavy diet isn't sufficient to meet her needs. While taking iron supplements is probably a good start, there are many other factors that can increase or decrease iron absorption (for example consuming vitamin C with iron will increase absorption, while foods containing phytic acid will decrease absorption). There is no reason why she would have to rely upon meat as a superior source of iron.   Finally, nobody is pushing anything upon you by simply writing something on the internet. Feminists aren't forcing their beliefs upon others when they say that women should receive equal pay for equal work or when they say all women should have the opportunity to receive a basic education. As Elie Wiesel famously wrote:   We must take sides. Neutrality helps the oppressor, never the victim. Silence encourages the tormentor, never the tormented. Sometimes we must interfere.  The people who are pushing their beliefs on others are those who are forcing animals to live lives in terrible conditions of confinement and who force these animals to ultimately be slaughtered for their meals.     There are large communities of people over at /r/vegetarianketo and /r/veganketo surviving on the sort of diet you are proposing without any meat. That said, following the sort of diet you propose is still vastly outside of mainstream dietary advice (despite being perfectly possible as a vegan).   The American Dietetic Association addresses Omega-3s in their position paper. I'm much more inclined to trust the world's most prominent dietetic organization on the subject (who also cites peer reviewed research to back up their position) than I am inclined to take your word on it.   Every major dietary organization in the world has published statements saying appropriately planned vegan diets are healthy for all stages of life. Anyone who rejects that is radically outside of the overwhelming scientific consensus.  **[American Dietetic Association](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19562864)**   It is the position of the American Dietetic Association that appropriately planned vegetarian diets, including total vegetarian or vegan diets, are healthful, nutritionally adequate, and may provide health benefits in the prevention and treatment of certain diseases.

There are tons of foods fortified with vitamin B12 and a supplement costs pennies per day. This is not an insurmountable hurdle.   You mean amino acids, not proteins. The same amino acids are used by all known life forms though, so these are by no means easier to get from meat than from a plant-based diet.

I put mushrooms, beans, tomatoes, avocado, corn and so on until /u/test_subject7471 comes over and eats all my food.  FTFY     Nope. I spend 40 hours per week working for a company that administers health insurance and pension plans. I do volunteer with animal rights groups in my free time in addition to sharing things on reddit.   Also /u/tyroneking deserves a lot of credit for [this comment](http://np.reddit.com/r/gifs/comments/36qv3n/laying_down_with_a_cow/crgfw1u).   I'm vegan for the animals, but my health, the environment, and personal superiority are nice added benefits!   Those first three are all gifs that I made and shared. That last one was someone else.   Check out /r/veganrecipes. It is a great place to find ideas for delicious meals that are egg-free!   Once again, how would it even hypothetically be possible to show that plants feel pain? What sort of experiment could be conducted?   You're welcome. :-D   How could a study even hypothetically show that?  I am familiar with the sensational news stories that get published every time a new piece of research comes out about plants reacting to stimuli. While the research is fascinating, rocks also react when kicked and light bulbs react when an electric current is passed through them. That doesn't mean that rocks and light bulbs can feel.             Note: I did not write this. A friend of mine who works for the Humane League shared this.  I went vegan after receiving a leaflet on the horrors of the animal industry. This was handed to me four years ago, when I visited my cousin's college. I would like to pay this forward now by taking a more active role in animal advocacy at my university. I recently realized that to be the best vegan I can, I have to change not just myself, but influence others as well. With The Humane League's resources and support, I will enthusiastically work to increase people's knowledge on the environmental and ethical problems of animal farming, and hopefully spur them to action--and to veganism!                     There are a few people saying it is vegetarian-shaming, but people also said that last time I posted a picture that essentially said, "be nice to animals".   There are plenty of people who give up on their vegetarianism, and hopefully seeing a reminder of why being vegetarian is so important will encourage people to maintain their vegetarianism. Furthermore, simply being vegetarian isn't everything that we can be doing to help these animals. We can donate to animal rights groups, get involved in animal rights activism, cut dairy and eggs out of our diets, and much more. Hopefully people here who already care about these issues will do more to help after seeing just how tragic videos like this are, not just for this one cow, but for millions of other similar cows.   I don't see anyone attacking anyone. The only critical comments in this thread are in response to the person who said they wish they were as lucky as that cow.                                    I enjoyed it, I'm glad he did it, but there was way too much, "you could stop eating chicken, but you're not going to do that."   A piece like that needs to have the guts to say, "we *should* stop eating chicken." Without that it will only have a tiny fraction of the impact that it otherwise could.   I'm not the person who wrote the message, so I couldn't tell you.   I have been vegan for the past 7 years. Ultimately ethical veganism is a boycott intended to lessen the demand for animal products. Other animals do not possess all of the capacities that a typical human would have, but they show responses that appear quite similar to our own reactions to suffering when treated in many of the ways that would cause us to suffer.  [Utilitarianism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utilitarianism) is a common school of ethical thought amongst vegans. Utilitarians view an action as good if it maximizes the amount of goodness (generally judged as increasing pleasure or happiness, and minimizing pain or suffering) that is expected to occur as a result. While many ethical vegans will openly admit that they enjoy the taste of meat (evidenced by the numerous meat alternatives available for vegans today), they recognize that the harm caused to other animals to produce these products almost certainly exceeds the pleasure they gain as a result. The boycott that is veganism lessens demand for these products, and correspondingly supply will decrease as a result.  Another way of expressing this is in the principle of [equal consideration of interests](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equal_consideration_of_interests). That is to say that the interest of any individual should be given equal consideration where, and to the extent that the interest exists. This isn't to say that all interests are equal, experienced equally, or that all animals possess interests, but that where there are interests, we should weight that interest proportionally to the intensity of the interest and not discriminate on any other basis.   Most vegans don't care what you eat. They care about who you eat and who is harmed in the process of producing it. I think we can all agree that it is important to consider how our choices may harm other individuals.   I do not. A Facebook friend of mine who works there shared this.                  I am interested in interning with The Humane League because I was recently exposed to issues of farm animal cruelty when someone was handing out leaflets on my college campus. The leaflets included information about the abuse farm animals suffer and a quote about how it's odd that we cuddle some animals (our pets) but stick forks in others (farm animals). I have always been an animal lover and have been trying to become vegetarian for years, but this really hit home with me and I have become vegetarian. I think that spreading awareness about animal cruelty is the most efficient way to get people to understand it, as many people are unaware of the cruelty that occurs. I would love to be part of an organization that works to fight against this.                  Did you give that mouse a cookie?   Now I want to try hitting a PB J sandwich with a baseball bat and film it with my high speed camera.    Humans are not sentient. You're just anthropomorphizing.   You know me well.  I eat a lot of the foods featured in this fridge, but it is not mine.                                    The threads that were deleted because people's personal information was revealed, which also led to accounts being banned?  Are you trying to set me up?   There is overwhelming consensus that humans can be healthy on vegan diets. Once again, who cares if it is "natural" or not?  **[American Dietetic Association](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19562864)**   It is the position of the American Dietetic Association that appropriately planned vegetarian diets, including total vegetarian or vegan diets, are healthful, nutritionally adequate, and may provide health benefits in the prevention and treatment of certain diseases.

Australians following a vegetarian diet can still meet nutrient requirements if energy needs are met and the appropriate number and variety of serves from the Five Food Groups are eaten throughout the day. For those eating a vegan diet, supplementation of B12 is recommended.  **[The Mayo Clinic](http://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-living/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/in-depth/vegetarian-diet/art-20046446)**    A well-planned vegetarian diet (*see context*) can meet the needs of people of all ages, including children, teenagers, and pregnant or breast-feeding women. The key is to be aware of your nutritional needs so that you plan a diet that meets them.  **[The Heart and Stroke Foundation of Canada](http://www.heartandstroke.com/site/c.ikIQLcMWJtE/b.3484249/k.2F6C/Healthy_living__Vegetarian_diets.htm)**   Vegetarian diets (*see context*) can provide all the nutrients you need at any age, as well as some additional health benefits.   We also don't commonly live to 80 years old in nature. We all benefit greatly from fortified foods like iodized salt, enriched flour, and fortified cereals. It is also recommended that [all pregnant women take a folic acid supplement](http://www.webmd.com/baby/folic-acid-and-pregnancy). We can, and already are doing things much better than nature thanks to supplements and fortified foods, and many other unnatural aspects of modern life.  On the other hand, humans have engaged in tribal violence for all of recorded history and we even see signs of it among other great apes, so war and violence seem very natural, but I think we would both agree that they are not good.  Simply stating whether or not something is natural tells us nothing about whether we ought to continue doing it going forward.   I'm not denying that vegans should either take a vitamin B12 supplement or eat fortified foods to ensure that they are getting an adequate supply.    Good luck getting your B12 without supplements.  B12 is a vitamin, not a protein. It is produced by bacteria.   /u/Zhaey deserves the credit. He compiled the list.   But will we ever be able to answer one of life's greatest questions?

Reddit also has awesome communities at /r/vegan and /r/veganrecipes!   Yep! There is wide consensus on this point!  **[American Dietetic Association](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19562864)**   It is the position of the American Dietetic Association that appropriately planned vegetarian diets, including total vegetarian or vegan diets, are healthful, nutritionally adequate, and may provide health benefits in the prevention and treatment of certain diseases. Well-planned vegetarian diets are appropriate for individuals during all stages of the life cycle, including pregnancy, lactation, infancy, childhood, and adolescence, and for athletes.  **[Dietitians of Canada](http://www.dietitians.ca/Nutrition-Resources-A-Z/Factsheets/Vegetarian/Eating-Guidelines-for-Vegans.aspx)**   A well planned vegan diet can meet all of these needs. It is safe and healthy for pregnant and breastfeeding women, babies, children, teens and seniors.  **[The British National Health Service](http://www.nhs.uk/Livewell/Vegetarianhealth/Pages/Vegandiets.aspx)**   With good planning and an understanding of what makes up a healthy, balanced vegan diet, you can get all the nutrients your body needs.  **[The British Nutrition Foundation](http://www.nutrition.org.uk/publications/briefingpapers/vegetarian-nutrition)**   A well-planned, balanced vegetarian or vegan diet can be nutritionally adequate ... Studies of UK vegetarian and vegan children have revealed that their growth and development are within the normal range.  **[The Dietitians Association of Australia](http://daa.asn.au/for-the-public/smart-eating-for-you/nutrition-a-z/vegan-diets/)**   Vegan diets are a type of vegetarian diet, where only plant-based foods are eaten. They differ to other vegetarian diets in that no animal products are usually consumed or used. Despite these restrictions, with good planning it is still possible to obtain all the nutrients required for good health on a vegan diet.  **[The United States Department of Agriculture](http://www.choosemyplate.gov/healthy-eating-tips/tips-for-vegetarian.html)**   Vegetarian diets (*see context*) can meet all the recommendations for nutrients. The key is to consume a variety of foods and the right amount of foods to meet your calorie needs. Follow the food group recommendations for your age, sex, and activity level to get the right amount of food and the variety of foods needed for nutrient adequacy. Nutrients that vegetarians may need to focus on include protein, iron, calcium, zinc, and vitamin B12.  **[The National Health and Medical Research Council](http://www.nhmrc.gov.au/_files_nhmrc/publications/attachments/n55a_australian_dietary_guidelines_summary_130530.pdf)**   Alternatives to animal foods include nuts, seeds, legumes, beans and tofu.

It could also mean you eat things that emit light.         [I shared this two days ago](http://np.reddit.com/r/UpliftingNews/comments/361zz5/chicken_runs_to_her_boy_for_a_hug_but_somethings/) :P         Someone else compiled the list. I think they wrote a program that did it.   I run a fun, small subreddit: /r/SummerScavengerHunt. Every year on June 1st we share a scavenger hunt list. Participants post photos and videos of themselves finding items or completing tasks from the scavenger hunt list and then the moderators award points to your team if the submission meets the criteria (teams can be one or two people).   Here are some of the items people submitted for last year's scavenger hunt:  [#89 A drink with a phallic name that isn't Bawls](http://i.imgur.com/Lnmg5mh.jpg)  [#142 Someone in a banana suit](http://i.imgur.com/3x3JG8Z.jpg)  [#165 A banknote with a denomination larger than 1,000,000](http://i.imgur.com/K5fmlLE.jpg)  [#202 Make a pair of ice skates by attaching ice to the bottom of your shoes.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaXsKrmg4io feature=youtu.be)  [#260 Feed an animal (besides a human) a carrot out of your mouth](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_qerX9uuK0 feature=youtu.be)  It would be great to have some more participants this year, so please subscribe and join in the competition!   In circumstances where no harm is caused to animals to produce an animal product then I have no ethical issue with using it. You will find this is frequently repeated position amongst vegans. For example, [here is an article about how it is ethical for vegans to eat oysters](http://sentientist.org/2013/05/20/the-ethical-case-for-eating-oysters-and-mussels/) (you can find several more articles along these lines with a Google search), and [here you can find an essay from Ingrid Newkirk about how she is excited to eat lab grown meat](http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2012/04/20/magazine/ethics-eating-meat.html?_r=0).  I think with a little research you will quickly see that cruelty is still inherent in any commercial production of wool and eggs. I would say we don't understand the experiences of bees very well, but it is quite plausible given our current understanding that they suffer greatly as well.   Finally, meat isn't going to be abolished tomorrow. Hopefully, demand for meat will decline down the road and fewer animals will be bred into existence to meet the lower demand. There are still wild or feral chickens, boars, and cattle living in several parts of the world, so their existence will continue. If down the road there comes a time when a majority of our society wishes to abolish meat then we can decide whether to outlaw the breeding of new farmed animals and allow the others to still be slaughtered or if we desire to invest in providing safe living conditions for the farm animals who are alive at that time to safely live out their lives. Stopping the mistreatment of animals for human consumption is not an insurmountable hurdle.   This really just goes to show your lack of understanding of why people choose to be vegan. While buying organic is completely unrelated to being vegan we are well aware that manure is often used as a fertilizer.   Being vegan isn't about some dogmatic avoidance of any product with some arbitrary connection that can be drawn to some animal product. The Vegan Society (which coined the term "vegan") defines veganism as:  Veganism is a way of living that seeks to exclude, as far as possible and practicable, all forms of exploitation of, and cruelty to, animals for food, clothing and any other purpose.  Veganism is about minimizing the harm we cause to others, which is a cause that most sensible people would get behind.

I have considered myself part of the Effective Altruism movement since I read Peter Singer's book "The Life You Can Save" back in 2009.    I added him as a friend on Facebook a few months ago after seeing some of his really cringy earlier videos. He intends for his videos to be humorous, and while I agree many of them go too far into the awkward and cringy humor realm that invokes criticism, I thought this particular video was worth sharing.   He is also doing a lot of other great animal rights activism work, such as having now passed out over 100,000 Vegan Outreach booklets on college campuses!

I'm doing a coffee cleanse where I drink 20 cups of coffee a day to cleanse my body of toxins, and I haven't been able to sleep at all! It must be because vegan diets are deficient in protein and essential nutrients.   I have read it. Good book, I encourage others to check it out.   I want to see more research about what works best for getting people to go vegan and/or reduce their consumption of animal products like [Humane League Labs](https://humaneleaguelabs.wordpress.com) is doing. They need more people donating to fund additional research.   Who do you think can afford to spend $4.00/lb for chicken, but can't spend $1 per pound for beans and rice?   Doesn't cultivating any land for any crop lead to loss of habitat?   I am not arguing that people don't enjoy the taste or convenience of animal products, but the point was made that they are "needed", which is false.   People are a lot less sympathetic to those who say, "I kill animals because I enjoy it."   You can also get nutrition by eating human flesh. That doesn't mean you need to eat human flesh to get nutrition.

 Pantaria has a lot of weird creatures, but the most popular are Dungeon Dogs. They resemble Yorkies, but can assume the form of any inanimate object. They tend to favor the forms of treasure chests,giant keys and statues, ensnaring and devouring adventurers who find try and take them.  Like Discworld's Luggage, the species has a stomach that apparently has no end, allowing the creature to swallow creatures and objects of any size. Magizoologists have confirmed that it's 'Really cool' and after sending an intern in, they confirmed that 'it's probably dangerous.'    However, they can be tamed and several generations have been bred to be adorable house pets in various colors like orange, blue, red and pink. They tend to bond with one person in particular and will fiercely defend them to the death. They also do well with children as their morphable bodies allow Dungeon Dogs to withstand rigorous play.   The species also enjoys adventuring with their masters, accompanying them into dungeons or even other dimensions. When at home, they tend to take the form of common house hold objects or sometimes other species of animals, albeit with the Dungeon Dog's true coloring.        YES!   I really wish someone would draw the Yogs in the style of Archer.   Livestock wandlers tend to be vegetarian and their forms are vastly different from domestic livestock. They're more like the animal's natural form. E.g: a pig wandler would be a boar, chicken, game cock ect. They also tend to be embarrassed about their forms and tend not to use their abilities.   Animal rights are pretty different because while meat is eaten, it isn't a major staple of people's diets. Whenever a person hunts, they can sort of tell who is a wandler and who isn't. Wandler's tend to be slightly bigger than the normal animal and hunters are taught how to make sure their shots are correct.   As for wandler- made products, there probably is a black market for those, but most would see it as gross.    Not at all my friend! Thanks for asking, I shall respond in order of your questions.  1. Yes, the animals they become are in relation to where they were born. A polar bear wandler would've been trained to handle warmer climates, but they'd have a stronger affinity for and work better in colder temperatures.   2/3. As for animal traits, the animal side is a tad like Firestorm in DC Comics. The animal side often nudges and 'tells' the human side what to do while in animal form, but in human form, this 'spirit' is gone. The level of control is dependent on the person's emotional state. If one is 'horny' or depressed while changed, the animal side can react in fear. Some walder's physiques mimic their animal forms while human, but usually the extent of animal abilities in human form is slightly enhanced sense of smell. But this varies.   4. The shapeshifting doesn't last while their unconscious. Holding the form just takes practice so it varies from person to person. I'd imagine that the longest a walder could hold their form is an entire day if their focus was high enough or they needed to get somewhere fast.  5. Clothing must be left behind or be destroyed in the change. Items as well. Yes, it sucks if it's in the winter and you need your cheetah form to take down a fleeing enemy, but it's a part of the job. The training in the north is done primerly without winter gear, so they have some experiance in the matter. Modesty is usually perserved by having a cache of clothes hidden or turning a hair wrap into a loincloth (those stationed in tropical areas favor this over clothing any day).   6. Wandler's can leave the order at any time without consequences. However, wandler's who are in service often look down on those who aren't, and life can suck in major cities where wandlers make up a good amount of the population. One character I plan for the first book will be dealing with his father's choice not to join.   7. The naming conventions are similar to ours. Expect to see some 'Aidens', 'Nathans', 'Devins' and 'Reese's' mixed in with some more fantasy typical names.   8. No, wandler's can't communicate with animals. If their smart and communicate with the 'animal' inside, they can get a understanding of what the animal is telling them, but outright communication would make them too powerful.      P.S. This is how I can most acculratly show off how the whole 'animal voice in one's head would work. Sorry if anyone isn't into superheroes. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJsMzTG1YCA      Hey Redditors, I had an idea for a world for a possible series I want to write in the future. Here it goes.   Set in a world similar to the medieval era called Faria, there are people who can become a single animal at will. Called Gestaltwandlers (Wandlers for short), these people are in charge of protecting normal humans and other races from supernatural beings similar to the Fair Folk called Volks.   Wandlers are found at a young age and taken to one of the three academies and trained in either swordsmanship, archery or magic. They also are taken in by a teacher who becomes their mentor/parent. When they are around 15, they are sent to the Hall of Ice, a  dangerous training center in the frozen north. Once their training is complete, they get sent to one of the major cities and either patrol it or teach new Wandlers.    When it comes to the world's geography, I need the most input. I know I want it to be similar to Earth's and due to the shapeshifting, I need it to as varied as possible.   Magic exists, but isn't very reliable. If one is a mage in this universe, they tend to only use magic in rituals, similar to Willow's in Buffy the Vampire Slayer. Magic usage opens the caster to the Volks influence and in some cases, can drive them mad. Magic can be used by anyone, regardless of race, species and gender.   Any questions or possible plot ideas? Leave e'm in the comments below, I would really love the Reddit community could bring! Thanks!    Magic and technology can match each other. In my setting, magic was discovered around the first time that spears were made, so it's always been a sort of arms race to see who can outdo the other. However, sometimes machines like airships are a fusion of magic and technology. True robotics is a dangerous and new field and thus golems are a suitable substitute. Healing magic is good for when your on the field and need a quick patch up, but so is a bandage. The major reason why magic and tech are neck and neck is because for every magic spell that's researched, a new piece of tech or weaponry is whipped up in a lab somewhere.    Yeah, if it's fantasy, magic is the logical choice. I think sometimes people read into things too much.    Pantaria's races Humans- As varied as normal humans are. Asian, African American, First Nations, you name it, the race is there.  Elves- Come in two flavors the hipster Light Elves and the kind hearted dark elves Orcs- Varied as humans. Although they seem brutish, they are actually really intelligent. Not all are warriors and some are mages.  Fauns- Fauns are bascily humans with goat legs.    "Light Elves" in Pantaria are like hipsters. They hangout in expensive areas of towns and cities, selling their custom jewelry and drinking tea and coffee. Light Elves are stereotyped as 'dicks beyond mesure' for their patronizing attitude towards other races, but this sometimes isn't the case. Light elves usually wear their hair long and flowing, braided with silver wire. They wear the most expensive clothes and favor wine brands 'that you've never heard of' like Yentarian Yak or The Crying Dragon. Pioneers in anti gravity magic, their cities are built to float and are often found hovering just above the cloud layer.   Dark elves are considerd to be really nice in Pantaria. They're similar to Canadians and are polite to everyone, even golems. They don't have a sense of racial tension, and will often try and get races that are at war to party. As a result, many believe that Dark elves are morons due to their ditzy nature, but in actuality dark elves are technical geniuses. Designers of crossbows, war golems, semi automatic mage staves and enhanced swords, Dark Elves cornered the market of weaponry and are the leading minds in weapons. The only two races dark elves have any form of animosity towards are Goblins (due to the weaponry market, Goblin tech is at a disadvantage due to 'accidental explosions')  and Light elves.Dark elves love dwarves due to their mutual love of beer and it's pretty common to see dark elf and dwarf couples getting married.           The LGBT community in Pantaria isn't a big deal. Sure, gay relationships happen, but one's sexuality doesn't matter when it comes to jobs or marriage. For example, a rouge named Nate is comedically omnisexual, wanting to and implying that he's been in relationships with every gender and species in-universe. He isn't seen as a pervert, just odd due to his mannerisms. Gay teachers are as common as heterosexual ones and aren't discriminated against. Yet the central romance plot is between two humans and is heterosexual.  I like to portray odd things as normal and accepting the LGBT community is one of the ways that I do it. Plus I can always have a different types of romance to spice things up.   Hey Zoey, I understand how rough things are. My parents and I, all the way across the world in Texas are praying for you! And rember, you're not alone. You have the Yognauts behind you!   You need to get an orangutan from the zoo and act like everything's normal.   Sir Pratchett would be proud   However, it would be awesome if the community did. Considering how devoted some Yogs are and how skilled they are, I'd love to see concept art or something.   Hey Yognauts! I've been playing a lot of Leauge of Legends and I wondered, 'what if the Yogscast had a MOBA?' So my question is, if the Yogs made a MOBA, what would their stages, abilities and class types be?   We need five different versions of the Yogs from different universes -Apocalypse World: A post apocalyptic world where all the Yogs are irradiated and use Road Warrior style weapons and skill trees. When in play these Yogs decrease the enemies speed and inflict a 'Fear' debuff that prevents a turn at random  -Super Yogs: A world where a particle accelerator exploded, giving a portion of humans (and dwarves) superpowers. The Yogs are a superhero team. When on the board, all allies gain +5 strength and speed.  -Agents of J.A.F.F.A.: In a world like ours, a covert team created by Canadian, American and British intelligence was formed to protect the internet. These agents wear the same black suit and tie (except for Agent Zoey, her tie is rainbow colored). When in play these Yogs provide a special buff called 'Back up' that increases the strength of allies.   Dog Yogs: A universe where dogs are the dominate species, the Yogscast consists of dog versions of the normal cast (have fun with the breeds). These cards have a special buff called 'Healing Slobber' that can heal allies or cause minor corrosive damage on foes.  Dragon Rider Yogs: Set in a universe where people ride dragons, a mercenary team called the Yogs, travel to various lands with their dragons and have adventures. These cards are cast two at a time, one card being the dragon rider, the other being their dragon. The Rider card and the dragon card must be on the field at the same time in order to use their unique dragon breath ability. (Sjin's Chili Burn, Rythian's ender flame, Kim's Flux breath ect.)     Plague, I intend on keeping the guild! I was partially inspired by Welcome to Nightvale and The Discworld series to make some of the weirder guilds just for fun. In each story, a new guild will be added and mentioned. In my first book, Death Seekers, there's a guild of Those who stand near street vendors. In the next book, Son of Magik, there's the guild of plague masks. The guilds aren't actually a major factor in stories, but sometimes they'll be hired by the Adventurers Guild to do some unsavory task.    In order to be edgy in Pantaria, teenagers tend to wear necromancer robes, even if they don't have any skill with magic. If they aren't into magic, they can start internships for major guilds like the Adventurers Guild, Warlock Guild and the Guild of men wearing those hats that make their faces look like concerned pigs.   Edginess also depends on species. Elves and gargoyles tend to be conservative, so wearing revealing clothing is obscene, meaning that their teenagers wear little clothing to show defiance. Dark elves don't wear much at all, so teenagers dress in parkas, knit caps, mittens and (perish the thought) scarves. Even Dwarf teenagers show their edginess by hanging out with elves, snorting gemstones and engaging in illegal golem construction.    Now I really want Telltale games to make a Tale's from the Disc series.   Well how am I going to find a realtor now?   Happy birthday Simon!   Dear Redditors, today I felt very sad. The man who inspired me to become a writer has passed, but now I feel like I'm going to finish my project because of this. As a tribute to a man who, while not as well known as J.K. Rowling or Tolkien, as touched many more hearts, broke down barriers and inspired this shy young man to become something creator. And as I see Death take Sir Pratchett into the great desert, I thank that man for all that he's done for our world and the Disc.   It's been a wild, heartwarming, horrifying and hilarious ride through a place that never quite made sense, and still doesn't. But that's the beauty of his stories. They parallel our world so much that I can't help but think that's what he was telling us. The world is crazy and full of the evil,the good, the morally ambiguous and potatoes.   So, to Sir Pratchett I say good night, not with a heavy heart, but with one that is enriched with the lessons, joy and heart that I have learned from you. Good night Sir , good night.   I don't see why someone from inside the department wouldn't do this. He or she would be angry enough at possibly losing their job to an uprising of people they once suppressed for so long. Now is the chance to try and stop them and make them out to be the bad guys, knowing that the news will blow this whole story up and out of proportions.    Hey Redditors. Why can people just put on masks and police the streets themselves? Likes a neighborhood watch.   Sensory deprevation sphere with speakers hooked up to the inside and a tv. My target can either play sonic 06 or be forced to listen to bad music.   Hey Redditors! Just asking for some advice. It's my first year being a volunteer at Quakecon with my two friends, and I'm not sure what position to apply for. My primary skills are in writing and video production.   Hey Redditors! For a few months, I've been talking to this girl I met in my college English class. I want to ask her out for pizza, but I'm really nervous. I can't drive, and this is a major source of worry for me. Help!   My name is Martyn Littlewood. For five years I was stranded on an Skyblock with only one goal - survive. Now I will fulfill Toby's dying wish - to use the list of names he left me and bring down those who are poisoning You-Tube. To do this, I must become someone else. I must become something else.   Well, my birthday just got sad.   Why not Mac? I understand that PC players will lose their minds when I say this, but I'm a gamer too.   If anyone can do it, you can!   Damn. Nice. You should do one with the Buffy theme.  	33
 Last time I got a BMI test done at my ymca that included a body fat percentage...It was around 24.1% and my waist is around 27 inches. So, according to that I'd be average.    I will be honest with you, I do not like what I see in the mirror most days. It's easy for me to pick out the flaws instead of 'good parts'. And I don't receive compliments very often.    My BMI is 23.4, which is on the higher side of normal weights based on the calculator I used...Now, I'm 5'1...124 lbs...and I'm a 19 year old female...Is this a normal weight for my height and age? I've been made to feel like its not by most BMI calculators etc. I also gained a lot of weight in the past year...I started community college last year and gained 20 lbs. I used to be 110, so I've lost about 6 lbs since I gained weight. I think this might be why I'm so worried about my weight but I'm interested in getting opinions as mine may be biased. Any advice is appreciated.       I find after 2 coats its looks opaque on my nails, I absolutely love it...Maybe try a clear coat over top if you're finding it too thin?    the ring and pinky finger designs look a little busy but besides that I think they look absolutely lovely. :)       Yeah, I'm learning its better just to do it myself! haha, mine don't turn out every time but atleast I'm only paying out for polish and remover! I totally agree with you, I'd feel soo bad if I couldn't give someone exactly what they wanted for their mani. I'm sure your nails always look beautiful, they definitely do in the now picture! :)    Same!!! The red I used for dots bleeds too so that definitely didn't help things. haha.   Yeah, you're definitely right...I didn't wait long enough for it to dry...I thought I did but I didn't. And I didn't have any clear coat besides glitter. I know for next time though! In hindsight I should've left them white with the purple and pink middle piece. It looked tidy.       I paid $70 for a mani and it looked like the then...Except she couldn't even do designs and she was the only in house nail 'artist'....One of the nails broke in half on me 2 days later...She told me it was gel and that it could only come off with an electric file or acetone remover...I basically filed it off after one of them broke...   I found leaving mine alone and not painting them for about a week or less always got rid of it.    No problem! And I am too, it's a really shitty experience for her to have during her second tattoo...I told her most artists aren't like that and everything and she seemed to get it but I'm sure she's holding off on getting more for awhile.    yeah, she moved once...told the artist it really tickled and apologized for moving and then stayed still.    Also, my friend is 18 and still fairly new to being tattooed so...she does have a bit of leeway in my mind...    She was a guest artist so I don't think I'll ever see her around again. But, if anyone asks me about my opinion of her ever I'll keep chode in mind as a describing word.    Admittedly she was, I cringed at her behaviour and didn't encourage it at all, but it still didn't justify the reaction from the artist in my opinion.

 As we live in a 'destination' area usually frequented by locals and visitors this aroused by suspicions a bit.  Mindful the neighbours car was broken in to a couple weeks back  I rang local police to report the van in case. They offered some friendly advice which in retrospect seemed obvious - just go and talk to them?   So I went out, had a quick chat. It was an Asian couple, they spoke very broken English but the gist of it was they had just arrived in NZ, and were going on a long trip and wanted to make sure they were comfortable driving with the new car, and were used to driving on our roads before they headed off! They kept repeating "Safety!".  I thought it was very nice of them to take the responsibility so seriously.   I just wanted to share this with you all to highlight the vast majority of tourists are responsible on our roads, it's just the incompetent arrogant few who ruin it for the many.      Yeah, a con artists who has set up a grant to inspire young inventers.. [What a total wanker.](http://www.jamesdysonfoundation.com/) /s   Jesus, little wonder you guys have no faith in your police or judicial system. Really can't blame you when they don't even give you a choice like this.   Your police and bureaucracy really really suck shit. I guess we should appreciate what we have in nz then. Appreciate your comment to help me gain some insight.   That is some fucked up shit. Ok, I understand where you're coming from, but they're looking for a reason to target you. By obeying the law you're rendering them toothless, powerless to stop you. Isn't that kinda empowering in its own right?    Why? For the record I'm from NZ, so this kind of shit very rarely happens here, we have a very different attitude to our police force (at this stage.) so please help me understand?     Fucking beautiful.   Their critique was cringeful to watch, it was an unabashed insult laden chastising that was uncalled for. Then **to insinuate he could be a mass murderer because of the fact he took pride in his appearance and you think he wanted to dress like  you**??? That's just makes you look like an arrogant fucktard.  Fuck the guy was there to sing, not to be judged for (what I though) was a spiffy looking suit.  He took pride in his appearance, they have no fucking right to put him down because he actually took the effort to look good.   I honestly couldn't watch their foul mouthed display, I felt ashamed for the guy, on the upside, what a fucking gentleman, stood there and completely took it like a champion without a word of retort.   Fucking Americans.  A deranged mental idiot uses any gun he can get his hands on shoot a lot of people..  The gun company didn't give her the gun? I presume they didn't tell her to leave the gun out? I also presume they didn't tell the guy to use their gun? No????? So how the FUCK are they being held liable?!?!    Here's a novel idea, don't give the fucking police a REASON to arrest you, and they WON'T arrest you!?  Firstly: 100 people marching with purpose through a city can cause a lot of traffic mayhem.  Secondly: it's fucking expensive to hold up traffic, to get diversions in place and have a police stop the cars because I'm sure they reallllly don't want some impatient git flooring it through the middle of the crowd.  Thirdly: you're protesting against police, which is already getting their hackles up, don't provoke them by breaking the law. Just no.   Because (and yes, i'm going to shamelessly paraphrase you here.) Everyone wants to justify sinking a grand's worth of wages into their shiny new toy.   Judging by the comments on a lot of posts, we have an awful lot of HTC and LG phone owners who frequent /r/Android (Jesus, should have seen when the G3 was rated best phone by the MWC, the mods were cleaning the semen off the floor for days, it was a major circlejerk.) and when the competition does something better they naturally want to bag it to make themselves feel better. Human nature I suppose.   That is true.   OP, after lurking in /r/android for a few months now, you have a lot to prove as the vast majority here really love bagging Samsung the first chance they get.  I love the figures, but when you have the first decent review: http://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/2yyftj/samsung_galaxy_s6_review_subject_zero/ And the top comment is "Worse battery than last years by a bit. But unless the M9 can blow me away with battery (which in all honesty I expect it to), I still think my next phone will be the S6 ^Edge?"  You're pushing shit uphill trying to impress most of the trolls here that Samsung can produce a good, well rounded device.  I do admire your effort though!    Interesting to note, however it's almost laughable my year and a half old phone will get to taste lollipop sooner than the newer phone I got 2 months ago..    Just let Darwinism sort them out.      Indeed.   A few select flagship varieties were upgraded first for influential markets to ensure people still bought the device, knowing it was going to be upgraded, however for the markets that they don't think people will buy a phone based upon the latest OS (smaller countries like NZ) they didn't bother releasing the latest ROM for.  (There's a website called "geekzone.co.nz" which allows the tech geeks from Vodafone/Telecom/2Degrees to chat with the users, and they've confirmed as of Feb they haven't even seen the latest Lollipop ROM for any S5's yet.   So Samsung aren't just scattering them once they've been approved, they're not even bothering to release them to be tested by local carriers.   Preeeety frustrating.   Fucking Censorship.    They've upgraded more of the very limited market S4 - i9506 devices to 5.0.1 (about 6 markets last I looked) than they have of my flavour of S5 - G900i (Just fucking 1 market.) So yes. Samsung are so unreliable with lollipop.   I love the first line " * Your old warranty is now void." yeah.. like you'd still have a warranty on a 5 year old phone :P      A little better than s4, but not by much, biggest benefit is water resistance.  Camera is not that much better, fingerprint scanner is really awful, heart rate monitor is a piece of shit.    Interesting, thanks for clearing it was up.      That's kinda fascinating, any idea she was possible of this?    It's pretty fucked up.   There are kinda two things you have to no morals to fuck with: charities and cancer.      But the s5 has the proprietary iso cell camera module making it more perplexing why they're shafting their customers.       As an s5 owner all I really hope is they enable "pro shooting mode"on the S5 too, because ignoring the camera2 Api on the s5 lollipop and then releasing this feels like they're kneecapping the camera to make the s6 more appealing to camera enthusiasts.   Then I would say it's probably not a genuine screen, and if possible place it size by side with a genuine amoled, s3-s5 you'll quickly notice the difference.   Also check out your screen options, you may have it on cinema, change it to dynamic?    Did you replace it with a cheap third party or genuine screen?          Could they suck from Samsung's teat any harder? Seriously..   Good Night Sweet Prince.   That also works   They have their laws, we have ours. What I was attempting to draw is the fact that the laws are quite disparate despite the same crime.   Maybe a little.   FUCK NO. More highlighting the completely different approach the different countries have. Yes, the amounts were significantly different, but this women was a repeat offender, and got off very lightly.   Then when you compare to do something similar in Indonesia and the comparison is pretty fucked up.   Is there a reference I'm missing?   Same crime, but completely different attitudes. It's posted as a reflection to how out of whack the laws are.      Fucking racist cunts.    This is true. There's a final moral line between sucking off the ego of the device manufacturer, and providing an accurate and fair assessment of the device.   Most review websites fail this moral test, and lean towards the former, and as you said - ensuring a steady and good income due to relieving further devices, not matter how many people they piss off due to them using their ego wank review as the basis to buy their next shiny toy, and then find out that actually the review didn't mention this fatal flaw which actually makes it a piece of shit....   Thanks, just read the review. Most honest review I've read in a while, I loved how they specifically picked up on the awful screen which also plagued the original Flex device.  The funny (!) thing is I was utterly slammed on /r/android for picking this up on an early review of the G Glex2 after a youtube pre-release benchmark was released. I insinuated it was not an accurate test due to only running 1 benchmark at a time (and unknown cool down period between) and people left more than a couple of unsavory comments as a resut, so I think there are more than a few people who just don't want to know the truth sadly, and the review websites are pandering to this.   Right, I believe you, but no-one mentioned this on any reviews I saw, which makes sense as if I were Qualcomm I'd be careful curating news as well.    Reviews. Performance wise, it's not stellar, but reviews have not mentioned overheating. (Or none I have read anyway.)  If Samsung, Sony are having/had issues why is LG able to pump it a legitimate phone toting the 810 chip. Either the reviews experienced some serious heat issues and stayed quiet, or the issue isn't as big as everyone is making out to be?   Don't get me wrong, I hate LG, but if they can make this SoC work, why can't anyone else?    How can the LG g flex do so well without overheating then?    Holy shit the Verge are like love sick puppies with their nose shoved so far up Apples ass they eat at the same time. This line made me fucking sick:  "Thats the same approach that Apple took when it expanded its iPhone lineup last year with some long overdue larger devices, and the ***payoff for that move was the biggest sales success in corporate history.***"   Can we stop calling her stupid?  I don't think she thought at all, you can't apply rational thought to someone in that scenario to be honest, your adrenaline takes over. Judge her all you like, but we have the benefit of hindsight.   Why would they bother?   Pharmaceutical companies have squillions of dollars to fight any legislation and even go so far as to actively inventiveness doctors subscribing needless amounts of medication.   I'm not saying it's not a problem, but it's just not worth it -not in the current political climate anyway.   Admittedly they've had some bad fucking luck, but surely shit like this should be picked up by routine checks?   Any aircraft engineers care to weigh in?   Fucking cunt bag mother fuckers. NZ misses out again. Fuck you Google. you Magnificent fucking cunts.   I have to wonder how many parts of Android that most users never see, and never appreciate. For instance the (other than default) lock animations, or features they never knew existed like Face unlocking.  Has anyone ever seen you use your phone and gone WOW! and you've shown them their phone can do it too?      Don't know.. Nothing came up via Google, but you may honestly have to ask a Japanese historian.      HTC are barely treading water in the mobile market. Only so many people want a certain type of device.  Samsung have realised this, and done a more shot-gun approach of have a device for every piece, none particularly great, but adequate. This failed when their flag ship's sales weren't great.   Oppo/One Plus have gone for cheap but good market, which is serving them well so far.  HTC have gone for the same market, 3 years running. You can only satisfy so many people in the world with 1 thing, before people start asking for alternatives.  Yes, their design **was** great, and won awards, but if they want to survive they either need Apple's iSheep affect to help the same thing, or they need to adapt.  They have not adapted by upgrading the Internal's, as one commenter on here mentioned, his 2 year old M7 is still more than adequate due to the chipset, so upgrading the internals is not adapting, as this isn't a very marketable changed this only serves to illustrate my point they have failed to innovate by upgrading their chipset with the same externals!  I mean people are arguing with me - saying that the people who bought their old device complained about certain features, which were then changes.   So are you telling me HTC are marketing to the same people who buy their old devices? Again, they're going to/have already hit market saturation in some areas, so I was looking for some diversification from their design, or at least a better enhancement than a purely under the hood modification.    You're missing the point. But very well.   But I want an HTC with options.. In NZ the Mini isn't stocked by any major retail outlets, our options here are either a mid-range Desire, or the One.   You're saying if you want a larger screen, go for a different manufacturer, from a marketability point of view that's an appalling attitude - we're not going to cater FOR any other market, other than the one we're been catering to for 3 years now.   ... Yeah, cause that's a sound business model.   I'm not arguing it was once a beautiful piece of kit, however consumers needs and demands change a lot over 3 years. As they don't release many other models (and certainly those don't tend to go to the same markets as the one does, they are making up consumers minds for them by saying this is the only screen size you need. Or this is the only design of phone you should ever want.    That is arrogant. And as I mentioned, design awards aside people slammed Samsung for "evolution over revolution" with their devices, yet praise HTC for doing the same damn thing year after year?   The review websites are very carefully avoiding mentioning the design copy paste. It's fucking hypocritical to the max and I'm so over the tall poppy syndrome.   You tell me you aren't disappointed the same designers who made the original m7 have failed to improve upon their design in ***any way shape or form?***   But    They've at least done consumers  a favor by increasing the screen size and pixel density for goodness sake! HTC have been arrogant shits and stubbornly kept the same size, same pixel density!    All I have to say: **it's the same fucking phone design for 3 fucking years!**   ***3 God damn years!***   That's just lazy and shitty.   I would argue, citing Samsung and Sony as two prime culprits who have done this - produced very similar looking devices year after year and they have subsequently had their mobile divisions post significant losses.  As the pundits loved to say about the S5 - "Evolution over Revolution" simply isn't enough to stay relevant in today's fast paced mobile industry.  A good example of this is Samsung - they are rapidly faced with losing their (once lion's) share of Android sales.   Should your logic ring true the sames of the S5 was released with no major cosmetic changes (argueable of course) over the S4, sales tanked.  As a result, faced with a do or die situation (which may be overstating it..) they have done a complete about turn on two things which were once elemental to their design ethos - SD card and removable back panel.  People may have no design changes presented to them, however the market has shown it will not stand for it, and no manufacturer is totally immune from public opinion swaying against them if they feel like said manufacturer is merely using their brand name as a means to sell products.   Of course I'd have to be a blind idiot to not realise it's not a significant part of the consumers purchasing decision. However, this is not, and I doubt ever will be the ultimate reason people chose 1 device over the other.  As a result they need a "catch" a reason to say "I'm going with manufacturer XYZ because I like their design ***and this new feature*** is what is making me buy their product.  HTC have unfortunately fallen into this, thinking they can get away with people buying their product purely because they're HTC. Correct me if I am wrong, but by producing the (mostly) ~~identical~~ same product for 3 years in a row is most certainly them telling the consumers "You don't need that extra special feature because ***I, HTC*** have made this."  As I mentioned earlier the only company who could pull this off is Apple. And HTC are as far from Apple as chalk and cheese.  However, if you have examples where you believe this may work, I am more than open for a good discussion! :)    For those supporting the move - the Snapdragon 615 is shat on by the 801.  [See GSMArena's review of the HTC Desire 820](http://www.gsmarena.com/htc_desire_820_dual_sim-review-1198p5.php)  Antutu: 27070  vs E8  (Snapdragon 801) 46857  Yeah.. They are so utterly kneecapping the M8. There's no if, buts or maybe's.       Actually he's quite correct - in NZ at least in Oct 2013 when the 5C and 5S were released.  Facts and source below.  The iPhone5 was $800.  [Source (see graph point for 2013-10-30](http://www.pricespy.co.nz/product.php?pu=1406659)  The iPhone5 was $899 The iPhone5s was $1049   [Source](http://www.stuff.co.nz/technology/gadgets/9265519/New-iPhone-NZ-pricing-details-released)      Severely disappointed it's not an ISOCELL sensor, but clearly that either was a gimmick, or wasn't ready for version.2 in time?  Also such additions as motion tracking autofocus is extremely awesome.    HTC are basically admitting they're fucking useless and suck ass at innovating, so they have to cheat by kneecapping their old phone in order to sell the new one.  They are admitting there's little reason for people to upgrade otherwise, and it's the fucking losers option to destroy the competition (their old phone) rather than produce a device which they know will sell on it's own merits. Because it won't, because it's a fucking clone of the previous 2 versions before it.  And furthermore, EVERYONE fucking bagged on Samsung for "evolution rather than revolution" with their S5 product, but HTC have done it for 3 years in a row, and everyone thinks they're fucking Gods.   The phone industry are a bunch of fucking hypocrites with a severe case of tall poppy syndrome.   This is what you've all created: The retarded child in the family who won't amount to anything because everyone keeps telling them they're doing a good job rather than telling them to do better.   Exactly, even they weren't stupid enough to think they could get away with the same shit. Again, HTC do it, and people think it's the best thing since sliced bread. I mean where the fuck is innovation? Innovation isn't using the damn processor as everyone else. Or using the same fucking camera sensor as everyone else, it's putting up new ideas, and actually standing by the choices you make.   As HTC have shown however they are not innovators, they are fucking sheep who don't even have the balls to work on their ultra-pixel camera. And everyone is actually congratulating them for this phone!? And looking forward to it!?! The same crowd who called for Samsung's blood for daring to release the S5 which was "too similar to the S4" and yet here we have the SAME PHONE 3 years in a god damn row!  /rant./   But everyone slammed Samsung for making a phone that remotely looked like the predecessor, however HTC do it and everything thinks it's God gift to the world. Fucking hypocrites.    Let's be honest here, most people already have a perfectly functional device, it's the WOW factor that makes people crave the latest.  Makers are slowly realizing they need a "Buy This MotherFucking Phone, It Will Make All The Girls Panties Drop at the mere site of your awesomeness."  One needn't look any further than Samsung thinking they could get away with largely a "Me too" phone with their Samsung S5. Not even ~~waterproofing~~ water resistance or a dodgy heart rate monitor could help the fact that the phone largely feels like a S4 in your hand.   Potential owners need a flash factor, something that makes people go: "Wow, what's that phone?" It makes them feel good, and helps to avoid buyers regret.  However HTC have missed the boat entirely. If customers want a good HTC phone, they could very easily go with the M8 and not miss anything from the new version.  Put it this way:   Your contract is up, you walk into TMobile, and go excellent, I can get a new phone!  How a layman sees it while looking at what phone to buy:  **Screen:**  * M7: 4.7 FHD  * M8: 4.7 FHD  * M9: 4.7 FHD  **Design:**  * M7: Aluminum unibody  * M8: Aluminum unibody  * M9: Aluminum unibody  **Operating system:**  * M7: Lollipop  * M8: Lollipop  * M9: Lollipop  **Speakers:**  * M7: Front Stereo  * M8: Front Stereo  * M9: Front Stereo  **Camera:**   * M7: Takes photos  * M8: Takes photos  * M9: Takes photos  Why would you walk out of that store with a phone that looks and feels just like the 2 year old phone sitting next to it?..   Most people won't - they will turn to the Samsung for a larger screen, or Sony or Samsung for ~~waterproof~~ water resistance, or Huawei for a cheapie to tide them over.   There's just no justification why most people with last year (or the year before) should upgrade to this model.   Don't get me wrong, people will buy it, but there's zero WOW factor, and this will cost HTC sales to their competitors.   Yes. I thought it was so obvious I didn't bother putting /s. However I was wrong.   Very true.   They really couldn't afford to rest on their laurels this year, and they don't have the Apple Effect^ to pump out a "S" version and think people will buy the new thing.  Same screen size as M8, same exterior as M8, same speakers (indifferent to most users) as M8, same interface with Lollipop as M8..   The users aren't going to notice (largely) a 'beneath the hood' CPU/GPU or RAM upgrade, as most aren't power users who benefit from alt+tabbing.  They needed to make current M7/M8 owners jealous, they have not succeeded.    Samsung are losing significant market share in China and they can't afford to: http://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=prHK25286814   Upvoted for the good memory. :)   I noticed the complete lack of OIS has been glossed over by bloody everyone.  As Sammy proved, even with a redesigned sensor (ISOCELL) you still need OIS backing it up for lowlight photos. It's a no brainer.   [This (and other sources)](http://www.amta.org.au/articles/amta/Brazil.Russia.India.and.China.emerging.middleclass.drives.extreme.mobiles.growth) show China as a new emerging market which isn't near saturation point for mobile growth yet. As a result Sammy have heavily leaned on Asian design culture for the S6 in a unbridled effort to grasp some of that newly available cash.   The West are a very well saturated market, the current expanding market is China. As a result they're pandering for an asian design taste rather than Western design taste.   the S5 has a fucking awful fingerprint scanner. How this got past quality assurance in the first place remains a mystery.   I think Apple are also eagerly licking their lips in preperation for the "looks like an iPhone6" law suits..   I think a lot of people (Especially S5 owners) are feeling fucking jipped right now that Samsung COULD have pumped out something like this earlier, but didn't.    Jesus. When he zooms in the quality looks like a hundred dollar point and shoot.   I have an s5 after a fortuitous insurance event after an s5 and can happily say they are so fucking alike it's not hard to see why sales tanked fucking hard.   A better screen? No.   Better battery? No, same screen on time.   Better feel? No fucking creaky back panel.   Better features? Fuck no! Unreliable heart rate monitor, and still too nervous to put anything worth a grand in a pool of water!   Better phone? Fuck no. Not in any way shape or form. (And I used the s4 for a year for over 6 hours a day every day, so I'm more than an average user and if I cannot really justify this, can't expect most of your average Joe's to do so.   Eli5 why does north Korea come across as fucking crazy to westerners. Is their leader fucking nuts, or is there method to his madness?    They're like fucking children. No! I don't want anyone else playing with my things! Grow up.    We're so fucked.   Samsung unfortunately have a lot riding on this. But I fear they've done too much to please those who buy other phones regardless and bag on the Samsung brand than those who are actually loyal to them.   Tl;dr pleasing the haters only to alienate your core fans = stupid stupid stupid.   Thanks, good tips.  My warranty forbids rooting unfortunately so I have to stick with the auto-adjust (which I only need to over-ride when showing old people photos!) black/dark backgrounds, and now using the night theme for Reddit Synch.   Yeah, suprising. Still one of the best resources though, obviously not something many people know enough or want to write about.   This does interest me, there's scant information real world available to layman who just wants to save a little bit of battery.   I have an S5 and before than an S4, and on both devices struggling to hit more than 4 hours SOT. I would love to hit more without the need to resort to powersaving. (Where's the point in having a Ferrari while driving it like nanna?!)   Well, you don't have to change your wallpaper, to make a small change but still save significant amounts you could change your keyboard theme to a darker one instance   It's more small changes can make a big difference. I've changed the theme of Swype to "midnight" to be more dark as in working to get more than 4 hours screen on time on my s5.  Also just downloaded Reddit sync with an amoled dark theme, going to see if that helps.      I should also add have you tried scratching the contacts of your battery terminals?  Just with like a pin/knife gently scrape the 'knuckles' of the phonebattery terminals and the battery terminal pads themselves.   Just want to say it's nice to have an /r/galaxys4 "please help" post where the OP actually responds to questions!   So basically the greedy sons of bitches got told to fuck off?   Update: Sports mode has made a significant difference! Thanks /u//Bedk for the suggestion!      It's like a leprechaun is pissing on your hand.      I agree, and as mentioned I've got a d7000 50mm 18- 140mm however the best camera is the one you have on you at the time! I'll try fv5. Thanks!       I think outta around 80/20%   80 = locals.. But they're targeted by campaigns constantly telling them they're driving like idiots.    Awesome! I'll just use sports mode from now. Thanks man, simple fix..    Good point, we really don't have the funding/money full stop to afford extra manpower/equipment etc to do this.   Yeah.. A bit!    Perhaps. I did in rarotonga, took 15 mins, happy to do it again.   Makes sense. To plead arrogance to such an infamous icon is a tad weird though.    Couldn't agree more. I recently went to Dunedin, most of the trip was alright, but we got a lot of 130km/h in passing lanes, 80 every other time.. Dangerous overtaking etc.    You could find extremes like this in every scenario, regardless of whether they're a kiwi or not.   Foreigners are however quite bad down south in comparison to the rest of the country. I can't recall stats, but they're not great.   We have ad campaigns targeting our bad drivers, drink drivers, stoned drivers, tired drivers and angry drivers, but there's very little in the form of foreign driver campaigns. (They're are recently putting some in place, but I don't think it's widely advertised enough).   You misunderstand my statement, I mean we have no idea how they got their license, no idea if they walked into the testing station, drove around the block and were handed a license.   Why is that? The police/government are such hypocritical pricks.  They say "Driving is a privilege not a right."   But then argue "You passed a potentially arbitrary driving test in a completely foreign country, with rather different road laws to New Zealand but yeah, of course you absolutely have the right to drive on NZ roads."   I saw that.. My heart goes out. I've driven that road recently, they would not have stood a snow balls chance in hell of avoiding a collision, and now that driver has to live with the fact he was in control of the wheel when that poor girl died. Just fucking tragic.   Thank you for providing some context to their actions. That's crazy....      No, we should keep helping out elsewhere - like peacekeeping efforts to allow other countries to focus on ISIS etc.   Million (trillion?) dollar question.   Thank you for the suggestion It's not preinstalled, but I'll grab it from the Samsung store and just leave it in that mode   Sorry, yes, damn I should have picked that up.   Thank you, to the layman like me this didn't make sense, but your explanation provides sound reasoning.   Good point.    Pretty much this.  I talked to someone recently who'd read the Koran and he realised how utterly futile it is to try and reason with them, so what can you do?   Can't kill an ideology, you can't reason with it and you can't change their beliefs. I don't think most people get this.            I'm not envious of ARS at the moment, they have the unenviable moral dilemma of raising the profile of this, at the same time as letting potential attackers know who otherwise wouldn't have bothered/thought about using this to their advantage.    Hi /r/Android I just basically want to try and understand why Samsung have a hard-on for using rediculously low expsosure times on a hand-held camera.  I have a 6mth old child, so naturally he's always moving, and as I've recently upgraded to a Galaxy S5 over an S4 I was really looking forward to taking semi-decent quick exposure photos.  I've been horribly disappointed that basically the bloody camera defaults to an (obscenely low)1/33 for EVERY scenario and just alters to ISO to cope, except for extremely bright scenarios!  To back this claim up I've gone through my photos and summarized the settings the camera chose:  * In a well lit pool environment (Shutter 1/33 ISO250),   * In a zoo on a sunny day (Shutter 1/33-1/110 ISO40-80),   * At home with good natural light (Shutter: **1/17-1/20** ISO 320-100)   * And out and about (Shutter **1/15** ISO400)  Even with an APS-C sensor D7000 with 50mm F2.2 fails to take decent photos at 1/17 hand held for goodness sake! And coupled with Samsung's utterly bullshit excuse for *software image stabilization* you just cannot use the damn camera for any sort of even partially low-light scenario with even slow moving objects!  To make matters worst I've taken photos with the iPhone5S and iPhone6 and noticed that..  * They take higher ISO photos.  * They have vastly superior software image stabilsation.  After having used the S4 *(which I usually didn't even bother to try and take quick photos on as it barely focus in anything other than perfect burn-your-retina bright sunlight)* for a year, I'm really disappointed in Samsung for doing very very little in the image stabilization department, I had hoped they would utilise the ISOCELL sensor to increase the shutter priority and allow for higher ISO's but this is simply not the case.  I will concede the focusing accuracy, especially in low-light is 99% better, but this is useless if you can focus on your item, but the resulting photos is ruined by the smallest quiver of your hand!  I'm stuck with the damn thing for now, but I just hope them to open the camera API and allow me to use smarter camera software to set higher shutter speed's or at least higher ISO's!   **(It would appear the arrogant fuckheads have chosen to ignore the new API with Lollipop for now)**  Is there anything I should be doing differently?   Is there a better Android camera fullstop which will produce faster photos?   What do you think, am I just being a whiny little bitch?   Pulse was good until they decided LinkedIn was an awesome partner and changed the GUI dramatically and made a perfectly functional application into a an utter dog.  Took them many months to recover from that.  	131
 I don't care for your books.    That combination has been known to cause uncontrollable cravings for wieners in the people who take it.   Well it would be one thing if it was a fresh leaf, but to put dry leaf in your mouth? Fuck that.   Brother.. you ain't gettin the tingle in your sacknuts?   Call their post office. If they aren't willing to hold it for you, UPS or FedEx will for sure.    Load a turkey baster up with hot butter. Get naked. Lay in fetal position. Insert turkey baster into bunghole. Have friend jump on bulb of turkey baster. Keep your mouth closed when he jumps on it so it doesn't fly out your throat. You're welcome.   Just mail it to your destination.   Well... As much as I love a good back and forth with a mentally retarded person, I'm gonna have to cut this one short. I hope you figure out your complex problem without giving yourself an aneurysm. Take care. I love you.   Well, you implied the guy was retarded, like he didn't understand that dipping a wet spoon into a bag of kratom was bad. All I was doing was pointing out that he probably didn't fucking mean to do it that way. If you weren't such an asshole about his advice, I wouldn't have said what I did. See how that works, pumpkin?   Kratom. It'll give you a tingly feeling in your ballsack..... ...Kratom. Toilet paper now lasts 3 weeks.....Kratom. You won't want to beat your girlfriend as much.....Kratom. Shitting like a rabbit is great...... Kratom. Gagging never felt so good. Unless you're gay. ......Kratom. Boners were never really that important anyway. ....Kratom. Crying when the mail's late is normal, right? .....Kratom. So good even your eyeballs will be staggering. .....Kratom. No more wet shits, rim jobs are now game all day long. ......Kratom. No, you dumb slamhog, I don't want to go get something to eat yet. We need to get the fuck home so I can dose before I smack the living fuck out of you. (See number 3)   Amps just give me motivation to jack off for like 9 hours.    I use their measuring spoon, I just dump it out into a regular spoon each time and then put it in my mouth. It sort of surprises me that you wouldn't be able to figure out a way around dumping the wet measuring spoon back into the bag.   Fuck those dirty fuckin cocksuckers. It's shit like that that gives kratom a bad fucking name. Foxykotton. Anybody who buys that shit is directly contributing to kratom's downfall.   I would be out in about 3 hours, Kramer style   Yes... go there and search "speciosa" in the search bar. You have to do it that way every time if you want to see their kratom. Sorry, I should have mentioned that.   I hate to beat a dead horse shill style, but I take RVS every day, and I get it from Herbal Salvation. It's 25 bucks plus 5 for shipping for 105 grams, and it's great. Those numbers you're reading aren't really much to rely on... just get it, start at 2 grams, and go from there.   That's exactly the type of program Mac is referring to. It's ridiculous. The one I had to go to recently was $95 for an hour and a half session. There's like 12 people and one counselor. That's almost 1200 dollars they make just for us to sit in a circle and shoot the shit. It's a fuckin joke. I've done plenty of those outpatient programs, and I must say, if you really want help, go to AA or NA. It's free and it's sure as hell a lot more helpful than outpatient programs... unless, of course, you're mandated to go to outpatient, like I was... then we don't have a choice.   They're bullshitting you. It's a tactic they use to try to get you to admit you've done something. If your piss test comes back clean, there's no way for them to tell you've ever taken any opioids at any point in your life, period.   If it bothers you so much, you could just stop coming here. IDK if you thought about that. I think you might have some sort of mental retardation.   If you're getting high on oxy every day, your tolerance will build up to 100 mg in no time. That's a pretty average dose for a regular user.   Isn't it supposed to have a money back guarantee?   Wtf are you talkin about man. #1: He needs to drop two on an empty stomach and go from there. If he drops three with food in his stomach,  he'll likely not even fuckin feel it. #2: He also needs to wait longer than fuckin 20 minutes before dosing more, you crazy asshole. More like an hour. You might start to feel the effects after 10-20 minutes but they're nowhere near done hitting you at that point. I don't feel the full effects until about 40-50 minutes after dropping it on an empty stomach. #3: It's blatantly fucking obvious that both of those are plain leaf. Anybody who's done even rudimentary research on kratom knows exactly what those fuckin strains are, and they sure as hell know the vendor they came from, seeings how it's the most fucking popular one on reddit... if not the most popular period.  #4: WHO THE FUCK PAYS A DOLLAR FOR A GRAM OF PLAIN LEAF?!?!?!?! Take your shitty ass advice over to r/KratomKorner and keep it over there, dickface.   Poppy seed Tizzea.   Phew. Thanks for lettin me know man. Appreciate it.   Oh shit. I don't have enough posts to message anybody or comment on XDA so I didn't say anything over there, but I didn't realize you were the guy lol. Thanks man. Greatly appreciated. I sent Huawei an email 2 days ago for the unlock code. Haven't heard back yet.   Just get the Paypal debit card and use that on sites that accept Mastercard.   I wish it was a little more in-depth.   Well. Percocet, like anything with "ocet" in the name, has acetominophen in it... I know what you're talking about though. Roxies. Instant release oxycodone. Yeah 30 mg a day isn't much of a hook. NAMSAYIN.   This brother righteous.   I was just about to say that lol.   It makes an unbelievable difference... 30 mg of fentanyl would kill somebody, whereas 30 mg of codeine probably wouldn't even be felt.   Kratom used to cause me terrible sinus issues. They've pretty much gone away since I quit snorting it though.   30 mg of what opiate? Would need to know.   You just gotta get good at spreading the ballskin taut, and then itching it. I love it. Feels like Jesus is touching my nutsack.   Ginger root   Roger that. Can't blame you there... but if you run into any nausea issues, cop yourself some ginger candy or ginger ale. I chase every ingestion with a couple swigs of ginger ale.   Yeah my drugs of choice in order were opiates, meth, benzos and addies. That shit's all behind me now though, thanks to the big K. And yeah man it's only 6 bucks for 4 10 gram samples. No Maha Kali though. I tried asking for it, not realizing they don't give that one out in samples, and I ended up receiving a white vein lol. I was pissed. I just can't bring myself to pay 35 bucks for 100 grams. It won't be long before I cop a kilo of the Red Vein Sumatran from Bikhuk, seeings how it's half the price of HS. Unfortunately they don't have Bali, I'd probably just keep getting that from HS.   BLUCKA BLUCKA SUP NUGGAH That would make sense, because the Bali I received gave me more side effects than anything. I'm sure I could have talked to Ken about it but it wasn't even worth the aggravation to me. I use Bali every day, I would have to get it from somewhere else regardless. I did receive a sample of White Vein Indo from them, and that was the first and last white vein I ever tried. Nothing against them, I'm just not into the whites. Gives me wicked anxiety. Funny that I shot meth for 7 years but if I try to smoke weed or consume white vein kratom, I feel like I'm gonna have a heart attack. lol.   I ordered from MS twice, got Bali both times and I honestly didn't even think it was good, don't even understand what people are raving about. I went to HS and got way better Bali for a hell of a lot cheaper than MS, and I haven't looked back since.   If you just ate, don't even bother trying to take any more for a couple hours... it works best if you're hungry when you take it, I usually wait til I feel the first hunger pang come on. Having any food in your stomach greatly diminishes the effects... But you probably just didn't take enough. Take 3 g of that RVT and mix it with 2 g of that Green Malaysian. I love RVT but I gotta mix it with Green Bali to get the most out of it. Redosing is cool if you don't feel like you got enough of an effect, but not if you just ate.   I think I would like to own it.   Heyyy-ooooooo iOSPoundcake. You made a fine choice. RVT is the stuff dreams are made of. Is that an Apple computer I see? You dirty traitor.    I just looked at your post history under your username... you did morphine three days ago. How dare you come here and chastise us. Just because you're a morphine addict doesn't mean you have to drag people who are maintaining a positive lifestyle down with you. Shut the fuck up.   I, too, would like to know how much he took.   Shoot it into your dick vein.   ROGER THAT ROGER THAT TEN FOUR MOTHER FUCKER I CAN DIG IT LOUD AND CLEAR I GOT THAT GINGER CANDY ON STAND-BY READY TO ROLL IF THAT SHIT GETS REAL YA HEARD SICK TWISTED GINGER GAME SO HARD CARTMAN BE HATIN NAMSAYIN    YEAH NIGGGUHHHHH THAT'S THAT SHIT I'M TALKIN ABOUT BABY BIG DOG BONERTICKLER STYLE I'MA OVERDO IT AND HAVE A WICKED HEADACHE IN THE MORNING AND EVERYTHING IT'S GONNA BE TIGHT BUTTHOLE   AH-CHA-CHA    GOOD THING I GOT THAT RED THAI COMIN IN HOT FROM IDAHO TODAY YEAH NIGGGUHHHHHH STRAIN SWITCH   No, I hate whites and Maeng Da so I'm not sayin just mix anything with reds... I'm just saying from my own personal experience that mixing Green Bali with reds gets me exactly what I'm looking for.    Oh and mix Green Vein Bali with the Red Vein Borneo, or Red Sumatran or Red Thai or whatever. That's the ticket, boy.   It will definitely help with premature ejaculation, but it will have a detrimental effect on your sex drive. It's all about timing. Sex might not seem appealing an hour after ingestion, but you'll last as long as you want to in bed. Or in the kitchen... Basically wherever your slampig likes doing it. But there is a sweet spot, somewhere between 3-5 hours after ingestion... at least for me. A little trial and error is in order... but oh Jesus lord, prepare to pay for it dearly if you decide to quit taking kratom. You think you blow your nut quick now? It'll be ten times worse after you quit, until enough time passes by and you go back to normal... which, your normal is premature anyway. It's quite a predicament.    me fuckin too. great phone but desperately needs root.    The doc uses kratom?    Sometimes all it takes to cure kratom-dick is a little of the test_subject7558's eloquence.    Are you ready to stop touching children?   I wouldn't give kratom to my cat. He has to be ready for peanut butter time at a moment's notice.   That's extremely common. Generally speaking, if you execute sexy-time with your old lady, you'll still end up with a boner and the desire to make her fat rolls quiver. You just have to go for it.   He wakes up, hits the bathroom for a quick jack-off (his wife is a cunt), and then he uses a trowel to scoop heaps of phenibut into his mouth. Then he mumbles and stumbles for a bit, bumps his head on some things, gets some coffee and walks to work. Then he's set for the day. He says his hands have never been as steady as phenibut makes them. I suppose that's a good thing, considering he's a dentist.   What a coincidence. I introduced my dentist to phenibut and now he can't start his day without a phenibut OD-blackout. He says it really hits the spot, gets his juices flowing.   Dude, an activation rig consists of a magnetron daisy-chained inline with a 2 farad capacitor (500 volt of course) and a low-fidelity digitizer. Do you even kratom, bro? I feel so bad for people who ingest dormant kratom... my life hasn't been the same since I built my activation rig.   Just dump it out into a pile on a GLASS plate, and get a TV remote. Make sure the batteries in the remote are good. Point the remote at the pile while holding down one button for 20 minutes... any button, doesn't matter. After 20 minutes, all static will have dissipated no matter how large the pile. Make sure you don't let go of the button at any time while you're pointing the remote at it or you'll have to start all over again.   Huh? Are you being sarcastic or is there something I don't know? Facebook?   You are thoroughly entertaining me, and I appreciate it.    WHAT   No problem. Glad to help.  	66
 I bought a Savage and although I love the guns and firepower, it's very defenseless and it leaves me vulnerable flying around in free mode.

 cobra's gunna cobra: cant argue with that..  another gem: we SHOULD make fun of drunk drivers.   the question is: what was it used for??  but really i think its fair to use a washcloth with soap to wash your body, i'm sure i know people who do that. I remember thats how we showered when we were kids, but i personally havent used a washcloth in years. straight up soap to skin all the way!   Lawlz. Of course.   YOU are a fat ...mmBITCH!   thats fair   shes gunna look super hot lying prone on the couch when her back is out tomorrow, amirite guys??    ...is it? i feel like things like winters are cold enough to freeze things...   although actually i guess the cold beverage may only count as "nice" if you are drinking it while you are very hot, which maybe requires electricity, so since then, sure i could see that.   maybe im trying to overthink this but... i dont get it? whos taking off the top? man or woman? does it matter? im definitely overthinking this; help a brother out people!   right?   here's an idea; lets give drunk people tiny razor sharp objects and encourage them to throw them around the bar.  great work, everyone!  its actually shocking and/or impressive  how rarely you hear about horrible dartgame blindings or maimings..   edit: words  	9

Give me 4 nightgaunts and you can call me a cheesy lucksack all you want while I collect my 10 tickets   Feast of Snakes by Harry Crews   p2p1 warcharger  p2p4 metatransfer  p3p3 gloomfiend  p5p1 i like spiritleash a lot but it isnt that good in your deck. you have a death seeker/nightgaunt but unless you play all three, i think id just rather take a 3rd infiltrator. if you want to go for it though it seems fine, it won't kill your deck either way  p5p2 i think ossuary spirit is pretty much filler, rather take digitize for a trick or a 2nd wurm  p6p1 maybe death seeker since you have the leash, or sonic pulse.    same thing happened to me yesterday with the scarab, but 5 nekrium cards. definitely soured me on the card.   This book was really a slog for me. Interesting premise, but horrible, wooden characters. Peter's wife is a walking stereotype. How many times throughout the book does she ask Peter if "this is really happening?" It's pretty clear Shute cannot write women. Commander Towers is unflinchingly rigid and by the book. I had a very hard time believing people would act like this at the end of the world.  The book just follows around these boring lifeless characters who are waiting to die, and don't do anything of note....I don't understand the praise heaped on this book   I like Fallen enchantress legendary heroes and civ 5 for reference. Should i get either, neither, both, or something else entirely?   GPs are the ideal event for thieves - not even necessarily from the mtg community   The game has certainly improved in a lot of ways. They have implemented card crafting, which somewhat alleviates the P2W problem. The game is still not as friendly to F2P as Hearthstone, but it has improved. The introduction of drafts is also a great leveler where you can just focus on that rather than constructed.  They've also implemented drafts and constructed tourneys, which addresses the "not rewarding" problem which certainly existed before - there are actually fun things to do in the game now besides logging in and getting your 3 daily wins.  The game is about as luck heavy as any other CCG is. If this turns you off CCGs probably aren't for you in the first place.   Losing a close draft game with next turn kill on board to a level 1 nether embrace   Pretty much the only 3 tips you need to know to be able to draft, barring card evaluation.  I will usually let myself level 1 spell during level 1 max. I'm ok with leveling insane ones early (still try for 1 max though) like epidemic, twin growth, or spiritleash. If i can get nice value from it, I might play a spell at Lvl 1 that I can play for free the rest of the game like a contagion surge or primal strike.   It's pretty great. I've read some of McCarthy before so I sort of know what I'm getting into, but I still really needed to slow down my reading to catch all the details - and I'm really glad I'm reading it on Kindle, because I'm looking up multiple words per page. The prose as you said is fantastic though, I'm maybe a third through and already there are lots of unforgettable scenes.   you get tickets, which allow you to enter tournaments, as daily rewards. You can also buy them with silver (which is also accumulated for free), so yes, it is possible as F2P   * [The Woman in the Dunes by Kb Abe](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9998.The_Woman_in_the_Dunes) 3/5  * [Person by Sam Pink](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9496823-person) 4/5  * [Sunruined: Horror Stories by Andersen Prunty](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15721172-sunruined) 3/5  * [On the Beach by Nevil Shute](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38180.On_the_Beach) 2/5  * [The Sorrow King by Andersen Prunty](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10156063-the-sorrow-king) 3/5  * [Annihilation by Jeff VanderMeer](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17934530-annihilation) 4/5  * [North American Lake Monsters: Stories by Nathan Ballingrud](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16057298-north-american-lake-monsters) 4/5  * [The Demolished Man by Alfred Bester](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/76740.The_Demolished_Man) 3/5  * [Notable American Women by Ben Marcus](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/155641.Notable_American_Women) 1/5  * [Off Season by Jack Ketchum](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/179734.Off_Season) 3/5  * [Elric of Melnibone by Michael Moorcock](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1026508.Elric_of_Melnibone) 4/5 (reread)  * [Selected Unpublished Blog Posts of a Mexican Panda Express Employee by Megan Boyle](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9811933-selected-unpublished-blog-posts-of-a-mexican-panda-express-employee) 4/5  * [Freakonomics: A Rogue Economist Explores the Hidden Side of Everything by Steven D.

I have no doubt most of the guys at the top these lists are good and I've run into most of them, but "most wins this week" just isn't a very interesting stat to keep track of   Slam that nightgaunt   I guess people haven't played a lot with Scarab, because it's insane. Still probably below Strategist and GGP, but Scarab is miles better than Frostwild Tracker and a card I'm pretty happy first picking   towerofthehand.com to catch up on what you've already read. I suppose you could skim book 4 this way if you wanted to, but book 5 was pretty similar, so it wouldn't make much sense to do so   97 packs, 5 legendaries, 16 heroics   I guess I'm one of the few Ramsay fans...   I agree, although the only part I really disliked were the Sam chapters. The Cersei chapters are some of my favorites in the series.   I tend to check kirkus reviews, the millions, and book beast, but content can be pretty sparse. I was wondering what the favorite sites of others are, to add a few to my daily routine. Thanks   The recommendation engine. Like anything else it isn't perfect, but it has lead me to some interesting reads   I did it in the past, but found it lead to me not finishing a lot of books, so I try to stick to one at a time now unless I have good reason otherwise.   Encyclopedia Brown   Thsi book was really a slog. Great premise, horrible wooden characters. Peter's wife is a walking stereotype. How many times does she ask Peter if "this is really happening?" Commander Towers is just unflinchingly rigid and by the book. I had a very hard time believing people would act like this at the end of the world.  The premise is interesting but sadly the book is about following around these boring lifeless characters who are just waiting to die, and don't really do anything of note   Except it's only possible in arena, and your opp needed to draft two yseras in the first place. Guarantee it didn't happen   I really doubt that   Can't go wrong with anything by Flannery O'connor or Cormac McCarthy. I recommend Donald Ray Pollock all of the time, The Devil All the Time and Knockemstiff are both great. These books lean more to the southern gothic genre.  2666 is a great book.  There's a lot of horror on the list that is good as well - Lovecraft, Ligotti, Barron, Bierce, etc - good as well but not really like True Detective aside from the King in Yellow/Carcosa connection.   Winds of Winter   Frank Bill, Donald Ray Pollock, Nathan Ballingrud, Jeff Vandermeer   you're an idiot   Ah, makes sense, thanks   Probably a dumb question but how do you trigger it on your own turn?   To Train Up a Child   Or the lack of any wildly popular books on that list - Harry Potter, Hunger Games, 50 Shades, etc. It might be due to where the sample was taken, but I'm guessing it's actually a "books that are more popular percentage-wise in this state than anywhere else" rather than a "most read in each state" list.   I feel like the vast majority of people obsessed with speed reading are people that don't read and don't really want to put the effort in, but would still like to acquire the knowledge.  Seems fine for something like a textbook or something forced I suppose, but I'd never want to use the tool while I'm reading for personal pleasure.   You don't have to like everything that is popular. Obviously do not read Blood Meridian if you didn't like The Road. There are plenty of other books out there.   OK, there is a background to most of the stuff, so maybe Deus Ex Machina is the slightly wrong term. Nonetheless Stephenson continually uses futuristic technology throughout the book to get his characters out of impossible situations, so I think it applies. Certainly didn't make it any less groan inducing... I mean, he uses the Rat Things twice if I'm remembering correctly - don't they also save YT during the snow crash pickup? (In addition to running miles at warp speed at the end to save the day and take down the main villain?)   At the end of book Uncle Enzo literally presses a magical button that destroys Raven and all of his glass knives....guess that wraps that up.  The entire book is full of them. The rat thing coming out of nowhere to save the day, the all knowing librarian...   Snow Crash   This apple is MUCH cheaper and tastier than this orange!   poor guy   Lol, so many cheating apologists in this thread. He obviously cheated dum dums   Good Country People by Flannery O'Connor   The Devil All the Time by Donald Ray Pollock, book is just superb.   Can someone explain the gameplay to me? Couldn't tell from the trailer.   This lady clearly made a big mistake, I just find it funny that the response to this woman lambasting an author without even having read their books, is the mob mentality equivalent - flooding her amazon pages with one star reviews. People are such hypocrites.   Katamari Damacy   The Devil All the Time by Donald Ray Pollock   Banished   Lol, condescending much? Not every Solforge player is a whiny child that needs to be punished. Some of us are just looking for reasonable updates, and a reason to keep playing this game.   Then don't use crowdfunding next time if it's such a hassle...   Fix WWP please, card has been breaking constructed and draft for months now   Just picked up this game yesterday, quick question on trading - Started a game and built some light ships to protect trade interests. Once I became involved in a war, all of my light ships got demolished. Some of it was definitely due to me not paying attention, but what is the general method to protect your trade ships when in war?   Regarding the border and her husband, I thought it was possibly a doppleganger, so maybe expedition 11 never really left area x after all and they were all dopplegangers that came back.  Great book though, looking forward to the next two.   Here is the barometer test if you will like this game. Do you like Super Ghouls n Ghosts? If you do why the hell don't you own this already?   And the award for douchiest article ever written goes to...   repost   Sam Pink as well   http://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1yaood/18_great_books_you_probably_havent_read/   There are 3-4 titanfall posts on the front page per day every day  also who cares   Man, still waiting on an amazon price match...gift cards need to be spent   By no means a literary classic, but a fun read   The idea that some classics should be retired or are talked about too much doesnt sit right with me. I would never advise someone not to read a classic  Im not in the business of advising people not to read books. A lot of books are dated, but their time may come again. Classics are classics for a reason even if not all of those reasons, or the books themselves, are truly good.   Do your own homework   No point, LH is strictly better   it's a movie buddy   White Chicks 2   Years of Refusal is good man   Annihilation was great! Can't wait until May for the next part   Are you new here?   He didn't even ask for roguelikes.  * many items which change your style of play - check * weapons with different attributes - check * randomly generated levels - check   Just came out on Steam. I am a big roguelike/roguelite fan and have close to 100 hrs in Binding of Isaac. This looks similar but looking to hear if anyone has tried it.   There are of course legitimate reasons, but it happens far too often for every case to be legitimate   As of recently, I'd say more than 50% of my opponents mysteriously go inactive once it becomes clear they've lost, almost always returning once their timer hits around 2-3 minutes left in hopes that I've left to scum out a win.  Some modes it matters a little more than others (play vs. draft), but it makes the game unplayable in bite sized doses unless you're willing to lose or babysit your opponent for up to 15 minutes while doing nothing.  I understand implementing a turn timer or inactivity timer won't universally be an improvement for all, but something should be implemented by SB to combat this, it's a real enjoyment killer.   I haven't read this book in about 15 years. I loved it and reread it a few times when I was younger, and I'm now too scared to give it a re-read as I'm afraid it might be something I won't like anymore    And that's great, don't get me wrong. But there's a HUGE difference between when new gameplay mechanics are generated, and when they occupy a significant portion of the mainstream gaming consciousness. And indie games almost NEVER do that.  What a bunch of fluff. Why should game of the year be entwined with popularity? Of course indie games never "occupy a significant portion of the mainstream gaming consciousness", they can't compete with the corporate giants in terms of media exposure.    Who cares, his opinion means nothing   no kidding...   Mockingbird is still good :)    Let's restrict it to books between 1800 and 1920.   Best I've found is to use a PS3 controller for games where I'd use the d-pad and a 360 controller if I'd use analog stick.  I know you said you weren't a dualshock fan, but I haven't found anything to be better   Mockingbird/A Wrinkle in the Skin are not old, though   then don't play it   and by unantagonistically, you mean comparing a critically acclaimed game many people here like to games designed for 4 year olds? You're an asshole lol   Stick to Call of Duty?   nope   *With Liberty and Justice for Some* by Glenn Greenwald    Reading a book a week doesn't mean you are a shut in. I've pretty easily read 4 so far this year by just reading an hour or two before bed each night.   you have plenty of time, you just don't want to do it   Libraries are free   14/17    I haven't read a book in 10 years...I would **loose** my mind.     whatever floats your boat chief   Why bother eating a steak when there's ramen and easy mac?   http://phys.org/news/2013-10-literary-fiction-mind-reading-skills.html     Reading words isn't the same as reading a book. I get what you're saying, and Fallout 1 +2 are great games, but reading dialogue is simply not the same as reading a book.   stop watching tv   Because it's the quantity that counts, right? They can all spread their knowledge of the man with two penises to the rest of the world   That's like saying reading 50,000 words while browsing reddit is the same as reading a book. It doesn't count   no    I'm alright smart  you sure is     [Steelheart](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17182126-steelheart) by Brandon Sanderson   What are the last five books you read?   5 is one of the best in the series, sadly marred by horrible battle load times. It would rival 2 if they fixed the load time issue   myth   Worth getting for Blood Meridian alone, if you are unfamiliar with it. One of the best novels written in the past 50 years. The greatest living author's masterpiece   **PWYW**:  * *The Satanic Verses* - Salman Rushdie * *Stolen* - Lucy Christopher * *Abandon* - Meg Cabot * *Junky* - William S. Burroughs * *Found* - Margaret Peterson Haddix  **BTA**:  * *A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius* - Dave Eggers * *Blood Meridian* - Cormac McCarthy * *On a Pale Horse* - Piers Anthony    I felt the same way as you. Enjoyed the story well enough, but the gameplay was a boring collect-a-thon   Andersen Prunty   Flannery O'Connor's *Everything that Rises Must Converge* and *A Good Man is Hard to Find*   wait til you get 400 more dust from something else   If you do you will probably regret it at one point when warriors are the flavor of the month. I disenchanted my nat pagle when i started playing and i'm regretting it now   **Beyond Good and Evil** - great game with exploration, puzzle solving, areas that are cut off from you until you acquire new equipment, lots of mini-games(photography etc), good boss battles. Well constructed story and characters, highly recommended.  **Okami** - similar to the Zelda games, great visuals, great gameplay, cool paint mechanics, lots to explore, another big recommendation.   Seems like this game is just constantly the daily deal   indeed  	132
             I've been in a crew of 3 with a couple of mates since launch. They're not buying the PS4 version and so I think I'll want to join a crew that does stuff. No roleplaying or anything but definitely fun stuff. I'm an average gunman but an above average vehicle handler.  What does your crew offer in the way of fun/things to do?                                             RULES FOR CONSIDERATION:  -They must be somewhat realistic. For example Sonic and Mario are not allowed, but Master Chief and Marcus Fenix are allowed. - They must be proficient with guns. Swords and fireballs etc don't count. - They may be male or female.   HAVE AT IT!                                                         One of the most strangely fascinating films I ever saw was Waking Life.  Blurb: A boy has a dream that he can float, but unless he holds on, he will drift away into the sky. Even when he is grown up, this idea recurs. After a strange accident, he walks through what may be a dream, flowing in and out of scenarios and encountering various characters. People he meets discuss science, philosophy and the life of dreaming and waking, and the protagonist gradually becomes alarmed that he cannot awake from this confusing dream.                      Think about it. When your wife asks where you're going you can truthfully tell her "I'm going to the future." Say you had to come back home because you forgot your wallet, when leaving for the second time you could say "I'm going back to the future!"  Got any better pub names?                                                                                                                                                                                          Hey guys. My oldest and most popular series is Skyrim Roleplay Adventure where I never break the 4th wall.  Here's the first episode: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE_K8F-MGvw  And here's the latest episode: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qOufdKDD88  Please let me know what you think.   Hey guys. I've been making Let's Play videos for a year now and would like to share some of my thoughts of my experience.  My channel focuses mainly on story driven let's plays, my oldest and most popular series is Skyrim Roleplay Advneutre where I never break the 4th wall. In addition to this I have done let's plays of The Last Of Us (no commentary), Gears of War Judgment, Max Payne 3, GTAV, Metal Gear Solid 2 HD (no kills, no commentary) and Heavy Rain Move Edition (no commentary). I also make and upload random videos like GTA montages and I used to make the occasional Black Ops 2 video.  As anyone who does let's plays can tell you there's much more to it than simply playing the game with a mic in front of you, which I wasn't expecting when I started. I think I've streamlined my process a lot since I began doing this last year and the general quality of my videos has improved as the months have passed.  I seem to be plagued by inactive subscribers, although this may be due to my upload schedule. I always stayed away from a schedule because I didn't want this hobby to start feeling like work, but realised my subs deserve content at regular intervals. So I started uploading my two current let's plays of Skyrim and Beyond Two Souls at 8pm GMT on Fridays and Wednesdays respectively. This doesn't seem to have helped my view count at all. I suspect that because the majority of my  views come from America I should start uploading videos at USA friendly times, do you think this is a good idea?  I'm disappointed that I have nearly 300 subscribers but struggle to get more than 15 views per video, after a year of doing this I've only made $25. I've considered giving up a couple of times but then I regain the passion for making the videos and carry on. Another thing that bothers me is that people almost never leave comments on my videos. I welcome feedback and always respond to the few comments that do get posted. Oh well, if they don't want to leave a comment they shouldn't feel obliged to I suppose, but it would be nice to have some interaction with my fans so I can humanise them. For the last year they've just been some intangible force.  Anyway that's my experience after one year of making let's plays. Let's hope the second year is more rewarding.                                                                     I don't use Facebook much and have never used 9GAG or 4chan.                                                                                                                                                                                                         	198

Yeah, fr00b   cs:go compet.. if that does not require skill I don't know what does   55   No photoshop     	56

I first heard of it when my boss said "We're going to make our workplace green".  My reaction was "Ew, Why?  Green's an ugly color.  Why would anybody do that?  What the fuck?  But if you want me to paint the houses green, OK."  I got laughed at and I didn't know why.   Then having MIG7 aircraft keep on flying over for the entire time, and have troops march by for the entire time, and broadcast it live on TV?

Three to five times a week.   No, no I mean male or female?   Male, female, sometimes camel.   Holy cow!   Yes, cow, sheep, animals in general.   But isnt that hostile?   Horse style, doggy style, any style!   Oh dear!   No, no! Deer run too fast.                           Back in 96, I crossed into canada on a band trip.  I got asked 3 questions:    1.  Do you have any weapons in the vehicle?  (my knife) 1b.  OK, do you have any firearms in the vehicle?  (no)  2.  How long to you plan to be in Canada?  (a week, I want to go to the Edmonton Mall, and I play the bass drum in the percussion section, I'm on a band trip).  3.  Business or pleasure?  (pleasure)  On re-entry into the USA, I got asked one question:  1.  Are you a lawful resident of the USA? (yes)  It was easy to cross international borders then.  Now, I need a passport, and documentation to prove that I'm legally in the USA to even leave, let alone get back.  It's fucking retarded.  Back in 96, I TRIED to show my ID, and they had me put it away, and said "verbally, are you authorised to be in the United States?" I responded, Uh, yeah?  Why else would I be on this bus?  The INS guy just shook his head and said "You'd be surprised", and kept on moving down the line.    We almost got stopped because we had a russian immigrant aboard, and I'm glad we didn't, because I bought a CO2 pistol in Canada, and was smuggling it across international boundaries.  And some chew too. :)    But these days, I can't even go to Canada, (or reenter the USA legally), without a passport or an EDL.  **EDIT:** It seems like we're becoming the USSR, and employing the exact same practices we used to ridicule them for.  I guess "Welcome to the USSA:  Land of the Fee, Home of the Slave."         I have a 15" sub that's been doing nothing for the last decade. it still worked when I took it out of my rig back in 2002, and I just never got around to installing it again. I realistically will never install it in my vehicle again, but I don't want to get rid of it because it cost me over $500 back in 1999. I want to hook it up to my home audio system. How would I go about doing this? It's just the speaker, not amplified.      How well does it work for decrypting QAM channels?                     I have a budget of $100. I need to be able to pick up QAM and ATSC TV. Also NTSC, as there is 1 repeater here that still broadcast in NTSC, and the local cable system (basic service), is analog still. What is the best tuner that I can get for under $100? I have money now, so I want a decent tuner for under $100. Antenna isn't really an option here, according to my TV Fool report: www dot tvfool dot com /?option=com_wrapper Itemid=29 q=id%3df1f0978977115 e]. I want ATSC capabilities because I might some day move to an area where I can pick up OTA signals, and an NTSC tuner because we still have an analog cable system here for Extended basic service.          If you go to your clock/calander in the taskbar, single click on it to bring up the calander, and click "more clocks", you get an option for an alarm clock, world clock, countdown timer, and stopwatch. :)  ABOUT TIME!  Now I don't need third party software to do all of this. :)                                                                                                                              Such as a 20" CRT TV is easily watchable from 10 feet away, but a 20" LCD TV is hard to make out what is going on on the screen.  Forget about trying to read any text from 10 feet away on a LCD when watching something in SD format.               What is a fairly decent ATSC/QAM box for my TV?  It would be nice if it could receive NTSC signals too, so I wouldn't need to jockey between using the remote for the TV, and the remote for the box, but just use the box.  I have a budget of $100.  Any recommendations?            Microsoft's new browser, formally referred to as "Project Spartan" is officially going to be called "Microsoft Edge".  I wonder if they'll use Aerosmith's "Livin' On The Edge"  to market it, like they used "Start Me Up" from the Rolling Stones to market Windows 95?                  Surround baltimore with concentra wire, and make it a "no-go" zone. Ban the media from entering because of "security reasons". Cut the phone lines, power, and water. Disable cellular service, and internet access. Don't respond to any emergencies, and let the place burn down. Close down the hospitals. Nothing gets in or out except for food, which will be air dropped once a day in the form of MRE's. Let it burn. Because of the scum there, that city would shortly turn into a 3rd world hell hole making Mogadishu look like Disney World. They hate police and emergency responders? Fine. Let's see how well they get along without them at all.                                                                        It's no longer on channel 9, instead I'm getting a station called "Antenna TV".  Where did Fox28 go on the analog feed?      [Slow-moving vehicle to pull off roadway.](http://apps.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=46.61.427)  Why does this need to be a law? If you're holding up traffic, PULL OVER! NOT HARD PEOPLE! (queue flashback to 2002 when I threw an engine rod on the Lewiston Hill, and drove in the shoulder, called my mom because my engine blew up, pissed in my radiator just to make it to WA state line to shut off my engine).   Fuck. If you're holding up traffic, PULL OVER! The Lewiston hill is beautiful at 7MPH, and it takes about an hour to get up it, even flagged by the state bull.  Let them pass, keep on your way, and only get back in the lane once you let everybody by, (optimally, just drive on the shoulder).    I ask because my DL is about to expire, and I honestly can't afford the renewal fee.  I know I can operate a Moped on a standard DL, but what if I can't afford to renew it?  Can I run an electric scooter legally?  Yes, I will wear a helmet.    If it's faster than a bike, I wear a helmet, (even if only a bike helmet).  I got saved once by a helmet, and I'm not riding anything that has power behind it without one).  But if I can't afford to renew my license/registration, can I get on my scooter and go to work?  I'l keep off of the public highways when I can, but if there's no sidewalk or shoulder, then I'll keep in the right lane.  Do I need one of those orange triangles on my back, (because I'm going less than 35).  No, I'm not getting on the interstate.      I'm in Eastern WA, and I just heard a couple robins chirp outside of my window.  Time is now 0148, and it doesn't even start getting light until around 0542.  Why are they chirping in the dark?  WTF?         I'm not sure where to put this, as it's not on a physical Macintosh, but it's on a emulated PPC running in SheepShaver on my Windows 10 installation.

I really don't have a need for Enterprise, so when the next release is made available, can I just upgrade the build to Pro, or will I need to clean install?           	200
 OP /u/chimpaman, contrary to common belief when you use e.g. you are supposed to list things and i.e. is when you elaborate/restate what you just said.   All I have to say is that, a good story excutes on a few basic points. Character development, conflict, suspense, and the resolution. All this were either non-existent, half-assed or just plain unsatisfying. I just don't understand how so many people could like the movie.   Green place confused me, but I guess what I'm trying to say is that, if I remember correctly, where the water was being kept...just above that...there was grass and whatnot and that's where the main female character ended up in the end when they were going up the 'elevator' contraption. Also, WHY do they want to go to the greenland in the first place, didn't get that either.   No man, They did him right in my opinion. Granted, I never read comic books at all so I don't know exactly the in's and out's of Kingpin's character but I get the essence of him. And I feel like they took a comic character and made him a REAL human being. Also, the reason he was a 'numbskull' was that he truly fell in love and it changed him. I think we will definitely get a more darker Kingpin in the future of the show though which would be cool to see.   Thanks for respecting my opinion :)   Where do I begin. I hated the orange filter over the film, Tom Hardy doesn't even talk, they didn't really introduce the setting or environment for those who have never seen a mad max film before (like me), the conflict at hand was sort of confusing, they drive for about an hour in one direction only to drive back, their were probably more explosions than words spoken and dare I say that the transformer movies that people shit on had more of a story and coolness factor than this movie, they want to see the green place or whatever the fuck but you see the grass on top of the pillars in the beginning of the movie, this movie could have been over in 13 minutes had they seen the grass on the top of the pillars, OHHH and if the mass majority lived without water and power why the fuck don't they revolt, how did the world become the sahara desert, what is the world like on other continents, and lastly the story was absolutely non-existent which kind of pisses me off and I am not hard to please when it comes to movies, but this is one of the few movies that I've ever truly hated and it disgusts me that people drool over it and honestly demand more movies like it.  TL;DR: Mad Max is garbage. Don't get sucked into the hype.   Marketing. Get as many people to know about the game. Advertising early gives you more time.   It depends...If you run in the direction of the earth spin you would stay in the same place in space (therefore it would take 24 hours). However, if you run the in the opposite direction of the earth spinning then you would actually take only 12 hours.   Love to experience 'The Dark Knight' in the theaters for the first time.   Funnel Cake. Only get them when I go to the beach. Only twice in my life.   The Holy Grail   Read the 'Death in the Family' comic book. That's probably what had happened years before the Man of Steel encounter.   This didn't change me or my life, but it was a great read. Check out 'The Most Dangerous Game'. Really short intense story.   'The Stranger' introduced me to existentialism   1984 definitely   The graphics kind of suck TBH   I remember when I was younger I once had a dream of Darth Maul chasing me around my house...Those Star Wars prequels really messed me up man.   Pretty self-explanatory...   [Lullaby](https://soundcloud.com/sonnywane/lullaby)   Zucchini   rhythm    Club Penguin. Don't judge I was like 10.   I think I'll just stay in the U.S   * Mad Max - I wanted my money back and I wanted my 2 hours back.  * Man of Steel - I almost feel asleep, despite how bad I WANTED to like the film.   Nailed it.   Please don't downvote me, but I didn't particularly like Mad Max: Fury Road.    Watch the Daredevil TV show. I'm vouching for this.   Bacon paired with ANYTHING else   OoOoK Chef Ramsey   I just imagine Kyle in a batman costume porking that one chick, and him just asking her "Do you bleed" as he 'dislodges' her diaphram with his huge manhood.   Not gonna downvote you, no one should. You have your opinion. I'm not trying to make a choice between the hosts and Wings (or say that one side is bad) but I just really miss the old fun spontaneous times ya know. I just watch alot of old PKA's out of nostalgia and it kinda sucks that Wings, arguably the life of the show, is gone. WE WILL NEVER SEE THE OLD CAST TOGETHER EVER, which really upsets me. Anyways, Murka and Kyle are great. I'll keep watching until those two are gone.   [Tum hi Ho](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Umqb9KENgmk) is definitely one of my favorites. Love song in which you feel the story. Music is the universal language.   Did you take this picture with a toaster?   Thanks for the link!   I would love to see a Green Arrow film. That'd be really good, the TV show is one of my favorite things out right now.   I don't know how you could do a proper green lantern film. Just like they can't do a Hulk film correctly for the life of them.  	36
 This would be a stupid move on Wilmots case in my opinion. I think Wilmot mismanaged this Belgian squad in Brazil. Though Belgium got as far as some expected after the draw was revealed. I can't help think that he didn't do enough to get Hazard motivated or involve him enough. Hazard at the beginning was tipped to be one of the stars of the WC, but turned out to be a shadow of his usual self.      This quote seems kind of odd. I feel like he didn't need to apologize because he wasn't owned by us. If anyone should be close to apologizing, it's Courtois, but even so, I don't want him apologizing either.  Costa didn't have a %100 guarantee of being sold to Chelsea so he shouldn't be sorry for putting on a good *audition*, he should probably apologize to terry for irritating him haha.   Ha ok then I don't know.    Hmm, it was working initially... I even checked since I posted it from mobile to see if the URL was different. But now I'm actually having trouble accessing it too. Might be a disruption on their end.      Why did Argentina bring Palacios to Brazil with them instead of this man?   Separate ways by journey??   Yeah I remember his album with josh where is was basically all guitar instrumentals. And that's an awesome fact about curtains ha   Yes indeed, John is a beautiful human being. Now I don't have any knowledge of this, I haven't read any articles or anything. But in his solo albums does he make all the sounds? Not necessarily play all the instruments but maybe does he use computer programs and such? Or does he bring people in to sort of collaborate.   I know, he's one of the guitarists that I associate with their guitar. In a sense when I hear him play, it feels like it's speaking for him. He's a pretty eccentric dude so I can only assume that he's been trying to really experiment, and maybe it's selfish for me to tell him what to make, but oh well.   Why is this a thread? Seems like Marketing 101 for the 1960's.   My other favorites from the album are The Mirror and The Will To Death, gotta love John, however, I couldn't really get into his newest album   Zzyzx rd - stone sour, absolutely a great tune   Damn, that was good. So now you got me wondering why this doesn't get equal praise. Probably the simple answer, Rise Against being the most recent to do it. Also with the lessening popularity of our involvement in the Middle East, with the video playing a very key role in my experience with the song.   i'll have to give it a listen.   From my experience, I haven't heard a song that talks about the warrior after the war. And the regret the warriors have when every gratifies them for their "heroism". If there is another song that does this, then so be it. But I haven't heard it   This is actually really awesome, is there somewhere he'll be posting the songs or has it already been done by him elsewhere?    It seems like English papers get away with posting bullocks   Sergio Busquets   Even though I feel like the East is getting stronger, it's still not the west... so we have a chance to at least maybe surprise some people   Damn, sixers drafted Elfrid before they traded him, woulda been oodles of fun   Oh god, that handshake at the end was cringe-worthy. Handshakes bring out the whiteness in all white people.   Jokes aside.. Lookin forward to Joel's impact in the future   I want the Sixers to be above .500 with Nerlens having a good year after recovering from injury his entire rookie season. BECAUSE HAIR.   Last Kiss - Pearl Jam   Camera Thief - Atmosphere  Make Em Purr - Sage Francis    I've always admired Rise Against for their lyricism, but damn did this song step it up for me.   DK in Donkey Kong 64   Hey reddit, I see this album mentioned a lot and how it has had a major influence on the history of music. I was wondering if anyone knew any articles that discussed this albums influences or basically anything that would teach me more about this album. I like music history a lot, but this isn't something I've looked into deeply, any comments would be great.   I'm just messin around, it's actually a good point   Fuck Iggy with a Ron Jeremy dick   Wax is back and crack is whack kids    EDIT: duh   Doesn't lead to a fulfilling climax? Then you've obviously never shouted "oh mama Mia mama Mia" as loud as you can, very fulfilling   Innuendo by Queen has some awesome acoustic guitar soloing, definitely worth the listen if you haven't already.   I blame Rosie O'Donnell   And sisters! You eugenist   Wish you were here - pink floyd   Nah, I wasn't talking about your whore mother specifically, just in general. The thesis was about the whore in everybody's mom.   His name is Simon Carmichael, got his PhD at the age of 16 from Oxford in Computer Science, and his doctoral thesis was on "The correlation between Broadband speed and your moms level of whoreness." Great guy.   Black by Pearl Jam   I see that album mentioned a lot, could you point to a good article or anything that would help me understand its influence a bunch more?   Higher Ground by RHCP is also pretty dope   The Scientist - Coldplay  Imagine - John Lennon   Ha, I remember their Pants song. I used to think that song was the funniest shit since Ace Ventura. Oh to be 7 again.   yeah i get it, god isn't real.   That's kinda the joke I'm going for. We all live our lives assuming God doesn't exist. So if we get to the Pearly Gates, we're all gonna say... "shit" because obviously we won't be getting in. Don't think too hard   Yep no problemo man, enjoy      Good album since nothing for the past like past 3 or 4 years. Sage is a lyrical creative monster as usual, shows a lot of emotion with isolation and heartbreak and such. My favorite tracks are Grace, Make em Purr, ID Thieves, and Vonnegut Busy. But essentially, if you dig Sage, you're gonna dig this album.  Ahh thanks for the clarification, I just always group Sage with those guys.   Rhymesayers label produces so much quality. Been bumpin Copper Gone and Southsiders since they came out earlier this year.    Lupe is pretty outspoken about his hatred for violence, one of the most well known, and that's what I respect about LUpe   And then my roommate looked at me and said, "dude that was totally tubular"   You probably think this song is about you don't you, don't you?   you mean you don't like that T.I. is gonna "split your ass in two?" :p   Link?   I remember the first time I heard this. It was a live performance on one of the late night shows. And I was like, "Holy Shit, what was that? That was great"   Have you ever listened to a song and it seems to really gel with you, except there are lyrics that just don't click? This is how I feel sometimes, and it can be off-putting. However, these songs I'm about to mention, I still listen to and love.  The two that come to mind off the top of my head are "Champagne Supernova" by Oasis and "Human" by The Killers   I know Champagne Supernova is the most famous one, but can't go without being said.   * Champagne Supernova "Slowly walking through the hall, faster than a cannonball..."  EGAD! Does not compute  [The moment](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3C7DECI0jU t=0m43s)   * Human "Are we Human? Or are we Dancer? My sign is vital. My hands are cold"  I don't get it, does anyone? [We are Dancer, I guess](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RIZdjT1472Y t=0m43s)   This isn't a thread about the worst lyrics, I'd like it to be the lyrics you'd like to change to otherwise good songs.   Conspiracy theory: Both songs occur at the 43 second mark... dun dun dun  Thanks!   Lover of the Light and Dust Bowl Dance by Mumford and Sons. And War Song by O.A.R.      I love RHCP, and even though a lot of redditors really dig BSSM, I think Stadium Arcadium is my favorite Frusciante workings for RHCP  I'm not a big Beatles guy so I won't witch hunt you about Lennon, even though Imagine changed my life (post-Beatles I know). And as for Thom Yorke, I really like about half of Radiohead's discography, and the other half I just like. And from the interviews and musical talks it seems like Thom gets a lot of the shine, but you'd be better off asking someone else.   *Marcus Mumford   Brian May, the only famous musician I know to have a PhD in astrophysics. Stud in my book.    Townsend/Moon destroying instruments frequently, Townsend hitting Sinclair at Woodstock in '69? Sure Roger was the frontman, but I think it's unfair to say he overshadowed those fellows.   'Giorgio by Moroder' by Daft Punk on the Random Access Memories is a really cool and unique track that has Giorgio talking for a portion of the song.   Ehhhh I don't agree with The Who, Pete Townsend and Keith Moon also managed to make sure they weren't out of the spotlight.   Yeah Pete Townsend took them to a whole new level. As for another contributor, I think Neil Peart, the drummer from Rush is up there. He is a really smart dude that also writes the lyrics, lots of good lyricism in Rush songs. Not to mention, he's one of the best drummers out there.  I think it's also fair to mention John Frusciante of the Red Hot Chili Peppers. Once he joined RHCP, he changed the game for them. Him and Jimi Hendrix are two guitarists that I really think are 'one' with their guitar/sound. So good to listen to.   The Who, Keith Moon helped turn drummers from time keepers into bad asses that can express themselves on the drums. Pete Townsends lyricism and brute force when playing influenced punk and expressed anger. Roger Daltrys presence on stage was also awesome.   Somebody To Love, Live in Montreal... To any nonbelievers  EDIT: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpEUXRz08t4   It seems like encores have become a pleasantry to the bands from the fans. If the fans don't call for an encore then they might be seen as rude or ungrateful. It's the same thing as saying "bless you" when someone sneezes. It serves no purpose, but if you don't say bless you, then you look like a dick. Unless someone sneezed before, then I might cheer for a sneeze encore, depending on the quality of the sneeze.   Words I Never Said by Lupe Fiasco from Laser. Sky Full Of Stars by Coldplay from Ghost Stories. These are pretty mainstream, but what resonated with me the most. These songs in my opinion are a shining light in a lackluster album. Personally, I don't hate Lasers like most hip-hop fans did but I thought Lupe killed that track even if the beat was a bit industrial-esque. As for Ghost Stories, the best track is an Avicii song with Chris Martin as the featured singer. Everything else about the album is mehhhh. Gwenyth Paltrow sucks.   I know the leaders of TPB got caught, but as for the site as a whole, is it still safe to use?   This album is so chilling, watching any live performance of this album gives me goosebumps.   It's not like riot is cutting them royalty checks, it's more or less a pat on the back.   Southsiders by Atmosphere, Copper Gone by Sage Francis, and Lazaretto Jack White   The Pokemon?   I like the idea of riot developing the community's idea, but they should also give credit where credits due. Maybe just a footnote on the bottom of the page that says "Originally designed by:_____". Doesn't have to be anything too flamboyant, and maybe give that user the champ for free and some RP, seems like good enough compensation for their contribution.   With the emergence of youtube and talent search shows, A LOT of people have the capability to be really good at singing. The person with the best image then emerges on top   I feel like writing your own songs is such a big part of the artistry of music   I suppose you're right, maybe I need to take a chill pill on it   I'm not saying their not talented because they can sing really really good. I just don't think they should be idolized based on the lyrics they sing. And people quoting their lyrics as mantras for their daily lives seems like a sham.   I get the feeling that with modern autotuning equipment, that radio artists are a dime a dozen. Find someone with a pretty face that can sing, and we'll do the rest for ya. I lot more people are able to sing than are able to write songs.   I don't know about full score, but Promentory from Last Of The Mohicans is such a slept on song   Personally, I really don't like the idea of a band not writing their own material. It's okay in my opinion for some of their material, but people that gain fame without writing their own material isn't really that impressive to me. When someone releases a song under their name, they are effectively advocating whatever they're saying, unless its satire. So it seems like when people admire an artist/band, they're worshiping a facade. How do you guys feel about this?   I can't listen to them any more after finding out their lead singer is in prison for 35 years for sexually assaulting an infant.   This is actually pretty off base. First off Motrhead and will.i.am aren't representatives of their genre. And there's also a clear difference in time frame and it's correlation with popularity. Motrhead isn't as likely to get recognized on the scale Will is. His popularity is a lot larger so he's getting haggled everywhere he goes. Motrhead is in the twilight of their career and loves the intimacy they can have with their fans at this time in their careers. Also, if you're in Hong Kong having visa issues, how badly would you care about having your photo taken with a stranger. Must've been frustrating, as is.   I BELIEVE IN LOVE, THATS ALL WE'VE GOT, LOVE KNOWS NO BOUNDARIES, NO BORDERS TO CROSS!   First person shooter? Yeah you're gonna get kids screaming profanities regardless of nationality.   And yet Finland has some of the highest test scores amongst the 15-18 year old range. Get more aggressive America. Little ironic.     This is just speculation and I don't have any hard evidence to back it up. But I did see that record sales are down since last year, and I don't know if it's a trend or not. However, with iTunes and such, it's a lot easier to cherry pick the songs you like and not need to buy the others. Could it be easier for the less active fans to quickly sift through a bands *newest* and *best* tunes without having to listen through them all. Basically, is a band better off hyping 3-4 singles for a bunch of sales than an entire album?   I'm not afraid to admit that I love power ballads, I'm not even afraid to admit it on reddit where I'm sure they're scorned. That being said, who's brave enough to admit some of their favorite power ballads?  	91
 Glad you are enjoying it everyone!  I ride again tomorrow night (Saturday) at the very end of the evening session.  I'm number 422, see if you can spot me!   Too cute!  And what a great mare -- you two can do anything together!   You can watch the show as much as you like for free!  They have live feeds from all three show rings (which work simultaneously), but most of the action goes on in the Coliseum.  I'll be showing my horse tonight in the Hunter Pleasure Amateur World Championship.  Evening session begins tonight at 7pm central time.  Have fun watching!      Go Morgans!  Proud to see my breed do so well!   They are an incredibly beautiful family!  Men so sexy, kids so cute!!!!   They are an incredibly beautiful family!  Men so sexy, kids so cute!!!!   AWWWW!!!!!  What breed?  You guys are the cutest!   I had a baby squirrel once as well, and then he was rehabbed and released into the wild.  His name was Earl. :)   The day I met him, I deleted my account.  True story.   My experience on OkCupid ended with me finding my boyfriend.  Coming up on 2 years together this winter.  We are a happy family (family = the two of us and the dog)!   He actually has TWO thermals, because last Halloween I *almost* got him to go as Dexter.  He looks incredibly sexy in them.  I wish I had pictures of THAT to share with you!   Here you go:  http://i.imgur.com/qdnoF.jpg (with our dog Apollo) and also http://i.imgur.com/JMLF4.jpg.  Perhaps not the best pictures of him, but the ones that are the most "Dexter-y".  :)  See what you think.  He claims there is no resemblance!   My boyfriend looks like Dexter, but he won't believe me.  Either way, they are both hella sexy.           I hope it is delicious!  On a side note, you have the best username ever.   I've learned to love mine my naming all of them.  The best one is Weeb, and his dog Ghosty.   I thought it was normal too until about 10 years ago when my friends gently explained that I was a freak.   Oh man, his beard looks nuzzleable.   Tall, sexy, great voice, glasses...what more could a woman want?   So hot.  So hilarious.  Dibs.   YES!  This is the secret game I play on the bus each morning on the way to class.   I want to rip all seven of those shirts off of him!   I want to rip all seven of those shirts off of him!   AH YES!  I have the biggest ladyboner for him.  And this picture is my favorite.  It's gotten to the point that just seeing radishes like these gives me a ladyboner!  And when he wears a plaid shirt and rolls up the sleeves, and you get to see those forearms...*swoon*  I've met him a couple times, and not only is he a total hottie, he is also a humble sweetheart.  A very nice guy!     Holy ladyboner!!!     He has such a great beard.  Good beard is key.   Major swoon, and such magnificent forearms!!!   I call second dibs.   That would be awesome!  They need little BSG uniforms.   Oh this happens all the time!  The Crazy Color Breeders as I call them.  I had to ride some National Show Horses back in the day that were all bred to be pinto, and most of them looked like they had been put together by a committee, and few of them had a brain.  There are, of course, some really excellent uniquely colored horses out there!  I just like a good horse, no matter what color it happens to be.   BAHAHAHA!  Man, I want a ninja to defend my uterus.    I think he's sharing something painful that is happening to him, and is also proud of his grandfather for the fight he put up.  I'm going to stop replying to you now, and you'll probably see it as a victory for yourself, but really it's me having better things to do than argue with you.   I don't think that is what the OP is doing here.     I don't like you.   It's nice, he's a culturally aware sociopath.        Ahhh so this happens after the egg has already cooked.  I must try this!    I, too, live in Minnesota.  Just wait until winter.  Then the bitching will commence.   I must understand how this works.  Putting the chopstick there to create the shape I understand, but the shell is still on.  How does it get though the egg's mighty armor?   That.  Is.  Terrifying.   Well the horse isn't fat, she's pregnant.  She'll be fine. :)   I love that it's wearing an oven mitt.   I had the ever-dreaded sunburn from snow, and I was wearing sunglasses with an earflap hat.  I *wish* I had pictures.   Whatever he is, he's sexy.   Upvote for ponies.   THIS!  I look at my boyfriend's can of abpa all the time and think, "what the hell is abpa?"   I'm a big fan of Baker Creek Heirloom Seeds.  Added bonus: their catalogs are beautiful!    Adorable!  For some reason I think she looks like the dog Martha from the TV show "Martha Speaks".  I think it's the expression.   I too own an Apollo, but his full name is Mr. Apollo Happypants Creed.   upvote for ears   Also with a name engineered for cuteness!   I've always liked the name Finn for a dog.  He looks like a Finn.   Starbuck!  She is super cute!  Mine is Apollo, also after BSG!  (http://i.imgur.com/8OuAw.jpg)   Ah yes, my dog is all about the bathtub.  He will also hop into the shower with you to get water if you don't close the bathroom door.  	56
 admission is the first step, we'll get thru this together   see, at least you can admit when you're wrong   http://mediamatters.org/research/2015/06/03/17-school-districts-debunk-right-wing-lies-abou/203867  will you look at that   nope   dont be so hard on yourself, you're only human, you make mistakes   there's always Minnesota...   at least we've shown that you dont always need religion to be transphobic   dont hurt yourself. i know it's hard to acknowledge the fact that you've been transphobic, but we can get thru this.   i know, it's ok, maybe you'll see the light and stop being transphobic in the light of medical science. until then, i can only hope you dont embarrass yourself further by arguing against gravity.   whoops, missed that. sorry, got all excited   nice when science shuts someone up.  thanks for playing, please try again later.   true dat   http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2015/02/150213112317.htm  say what now?   they'd actually see me as female. so if looks are your criteria, plenty of trans women would meet that. but why discriminate based on something so cosmetic? put a dor in front of the shower and wekre good to go.   if it walks like a duck, and talks like a duck....   hell, it's pakistan, for a woman just speaking up is probably a radical act   oh yeah, you made it pretty clear you were transphobic.   by mary cheney no less   misgendering again. doesnt take much to treat another person with empathy and respect, which you dont seem to want to do.    misgendering again. i didnt do anything except show your own transphobia. you may not want to admit it. but it's true. the simple act of misgendering someone means you dont give a single shit about the person. we're people, all we want to do is go into the restroom of of gender, do our business and get the hell out of there. most trans people dont want to spend any more time in there than we can help because of people like you.  and we'll keep on doing it, because most of the time, peopl elike you wont even have a clue.  thanks for playing. maybe one day the world will have fewer transphobic people like you. until then, i wont advertise the fact that i'm trans and keep on using the dang women's restroom BECAUSE I'M A WOMAN.  pretty simple.   just being true to myself, as are all other trans people. and you know what. you'll never know. the dude bro washing his hands next to you might actually have a vajayjay.   have a good one. i'll be in the women's restroom  thanks for playing.   thank goodness it doesnt matter what you think, i'm a girl, no matter if i have a penis, and i'm going to CONTINUE to use the girls restroom because that's what i identify as.  jees, it aint that hard.  and putting laws that restrict MY access to it because you're worried about somebody else exploiting it is ridonkulous.    I AM saying you have no business making everyone else uncomfortable because you don't want to use the bathroom that you are built for.  ok, right there, that's textbook transphobia. the bathroom i was built for? please, i've used both boys and girls bathrooms, nobody has given a shit, wanna know why? cuz people use the bathrooms because they have to go. nothing more, nothing less.    I AM saying that if this becomes the norm, it is easily exploitable, and that's a very dangerous thing.  again, unless you can show me a case where a trans person has assaulted another person in a bathroom, you're a solution in search of a problem.   i agree 100%   nope   if you really want to go thru my history, you'll realize that it's MY copypasta. i keep it handy for responses to posts like yours. i'm trans myself, i've DONE my research. i can respond to pretty much any question you have, AND back myself up with links and quotes to a ton of articles i've previously read and researched.  any time you want to have an intellectual conversation, go right ahead.   josh was also a minor at the time. look, i'm not defending the piece of shit, he took advantage of those who couldnt defend themselves. but he wasnt a pedophile by legal definition. NOR was he a "confused" child like his parents and pastor suggest.  but calling him a pedophile takes away from the actual issues    If I were to answer your question, yes. That's always been a yes.  then you have your answer. because absent everything else, you choose to press that button. which means you DO want to transition.

In a 2008 clarification, WPATH stated:  [S]ex reassignment, properly indicated and performed as provided by the Standards of Care, has proven to be beneficial and effective in the treatment of individuals with transsexualism, gender identity disorder, and/or gender dysphoria. Sex reassignment plays an undisputed role in contributing toward favorable outcomes, and comprises Real Life Experience, legal name and sex change on identity documents, as well as medically necessary hormone treatment, counseling, psychotherapy, and other medical procedures...   The medical procedures attendant to sex reassignment are not cosmetic or elective or for the mere convenience of the patient. These reconstructive procedures are not optional in any meaningful sense, but are understood to be medically necessary for the treatment of the diagnosed condition. http://www.wpath.org/documents/Med%20Nec%20on%202008%20Letterhead.pdf  **National Commission on Correctional Health Care**   Position Statement: Transgender Health Care in Correctional Settings (2009)   The health risks of overlooking the particular needs of transgender inmates are so severe that acknowledgment of the problem and policies that assure appropriate and responsible provision of health care are needed.   Because prisons, jails, and juvenile justice facilities have a responsibility to ensure the physical and mental health and well-being of transgender people in their custody, correctional health staff should manage these inmates in a manner that respects the biomedical and psychological aspects of a gender identity disorder (GID) diagnosis.   http://www.ncchc.org/transgender-health-care-in-correctional-settings    you're coming at it wrong. let's do the button test, shall we?  assuming everything else stays the same, if you could push that button and wake up tomorrow as a girl and NOBODY would be the wiser. would you push it?  therein lies your answer, because if your heart answered yes even if your head was trying to find a reason to say no, then you know what's right for you. a lot of us fight it. hell, i fought it for 30+ years, i only came out at 39.   make the appointment with a gender therapist   nobody said that religion was logical   something something freedom of speech   technically, josh was under aged, so he's "just" a sexual abuser   hey, tell the huckster not to claim to be god's messenger and we'll be good.   i see, so rather than let the trans people use the bathrooms they need to, you'd rather ban them from doing so, in order to stop fundies taking advantage of it.  yeah. how bout no. how bout we let the trans people use the bathrooms they want to use and then go after the ones who are pretending to be trans. pretty easy to do.   do you honestly think for a second, that a trans person, IN HIGH SCHOOL, would get naked in front of their school mates? hell, i know i wouldnt.   i see, and how many incidents do you think that a trans person has assaulted somebody in a restroom? you can google it, but i'll save you the trouble. zero. nada. zip.   besides, trans people have been using the restrooms of their gender for ages. it's the fundies that are trying to stir up fear against "a dude in a dress" going in and raping women.  trans women, and it almost always involves trans women, have been assaulted and killed for nothing more than trying to live their lives in the gender that are.   that's what my girlfriends say ALL the time, i have to turn them down tho, cuz i'm asexual   i post news articles all over the place, i like to read the convos that start. like i sad, aspel, different strokes, different folks   and i prefer a free-for-all. different strokes, different folks   i just saw that over on /r/politics. that was an awesome read.   http://thinkprogress.org/lgbt/2015/06/02/3665262/huckabee-transgender-shower-feminine/   a girl can dream   or just go with gender neutral restrooms.   While both serious issues, they are very different.   Body dysmorphic disorder (BDD), or body dysmorphia, is an anxiety disorder that causes sufferers to spend a lot of time worrying about their appearance and to have a distorted view of how they look.  Gender dysphoria is a condition where a person experiences discomfort or distress because there is a mismatch between their biological sex and gender identity...This mismatch between sex and gender identity can lead to distressing and uncomfortable feelings that are called gender dysphoria. Gender dysphoria is a recognised medical condition, for which treatment is sometimes appropriate. It is not a mental illness.  both those definitions are from Britain's National Health Service. With the changes in the new Diagnostic Standards Manual (version V), there has been the removal of disorder in the title of the entry concerning gender identity (which in previous versions was labeled gender identity disorder). Although there are still hold outs, the vast majority of medical professionals and mental healthcare providers agree: if a person with gender dysphoria is having issues with mental illness, which is not uncommon, gender dysphoria is not the underlying cause. Rather, it is society's unwillingness to treat individuals with gender dysphoria with care, dignity, and respect (including necessary medical treatment, when appropriate) which can lead to maladjustment. A great many individuals with gender dysphoria are considered perfectly well-adjusted, the stressors of gender dysphoria being comparable to other stressors associated with any serious medical condition.   it's a perfectly normal response, when everybody just assumes jenner's transition is how we all do it, where you just go away for awhile and come back and you're FABULOUS. but think of it this way, she started transitioning in the 80's. and then stopped when she got married to Kris. so she's been stuck in that awkward inbetweeny stage for THIRTY years. and they have said some AWFUL things about her appearance in that time. So she's had a LOT of abuse heaped on her, more so because she's a celebrity.  i know how exhausting it can get with people wanting to talk about you being trans when all you want to do is get on with your life. i try to do trans 101 as often as i can, but i do have those days where i will just go stealth and just get on with my day.  the media storm will pass, but hopefully, people will have gained a more positive outlook and a little understanding about what it is to be trans.   they're rare, but they do exist  http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/10/15/new-zealand-transgender-bellbird-_n_1967151.html   well, yeah, that IS what he just said   there are several medical associations that would disagree with you  **American Medical Association**   Resolution: Removing Financial Barriers to Care for Transgender Patients (2008)   An established body of medical research demonstrates the effectiveness and medical necessity of mental health care, hormone therapy and sex reassignment surgery as forms of therapeutic treatment for many people diagnosed with GID Therefore, be it RESOLVED, that the AMA supports public and private health insurance coverage for  treatment of gender identity disorder. http://www.tgender.net/taw/ama_resolutions.pdf   Resolution H-185.950: Removing Financial Barriers to Care for Transgender Patients (2008)   Our AMA supports public and private health insurance coverage for treatment of gender identity disorder as recommended by the patients physician.

In a 2008 clarification, WPATH stated:  [S]ex reassignment, properly indicated and performed as provided by the Standards of Care, has proven to be beneficial and effective in the treatment of individuals with transsexualism, gender identity disorder, and/or gender dysphoria.

The medical procedures attendant to sex reassignment are not cosmetic or elective or for the mere convenience of the patient.

Because prisons, jails, and juvenile justice facilities have a responsibility to ensure the physical and mental health and well-being of transgender people in their custody, correctional health staff should manage these inmates in a manner that respects the biomedical and psychological aspects of a gender identity disorder (GID) diagnosis.   http://www.ncchc.org/transgender-health-care-in-correctional-settings    biologists would beg to differ  http://www.nature.com/news/sex-redefined-1.16943   body dysmorphia is different from gender dysphoria.   welllllllllll, that's not quite true, i'm a trans female and i am VERY attracted to girls. and i know plenty of other trans people, both girls and guys who are gay.   oh, i thought you wanted to argue medical definitions, legal? jenner had her documentation changed, so legally, she's a woman. glad you simplified it.  thanks for playing.   lol ;-)   thankfully, medical science disagrees with you   no using the "r" word please   My friend from D.C. told me that  it's BLM combined with BSEE/BOMRE ... and the problem is, those bureaus are essentially self-sustaining (much like the Forest Service) by leasing these public lands.   which proves my point, your organs and your genitalia do not make up who you are as a person. a woman is a woman, even if she lacks a womb, or ovaries, or happens to have been assigned male at birth   but no womb. our organs and our genitals do not make us who we are. we think, therefore we are. it's a very deep philosophical discussion, actually    http://www.newsweek.com/first-successful-birth-womb-transplant-sweden-275376  say what now?   http://www.nature.com/news/sex-redefined-1.16943  no, we're not   i was 7 when i saw a documentary about trans women. the light went on and i knew i was one of them. i'm 42 now. guess what, it WASNT a phase    2015 ICD-10-CM Z72.51 High risk heterosexual behavior  just because there's a code for it, doesnt mean it applies to everybody.   we are not defined by our genitals   exactly, and the admins ban by IP, so no alts. perma ban ban. bye bye birdie   see, i usually keep it going because they eventually break down and let lose with a lot of swearing and threats. and then i report it to the admins and get all of their accounts banned   yes it is     yes it is   and miss out on all the fun? ;-)   yes it is.   yes it is.   it is bigoted to go against a trans person's gender. which you have, which makes you a bigot. see? wasnt that easy.   yes, you've said that, and you agree with bryan fischer, you are both bigots. we've established this already.   ah but i am a seeker of knowledge. i will happily believe in a god as soon as i have proof. show me a sign of your god's existence! i have been trying to summon a god the wrong way all this time. please show me how   about a third of all trans people would disagree with you. assuming 700k trans peoplein the US, that makes about 230k-ish. it happens way more often than you think. i'm trans, i'm also a lesbian, so are a whole bhunch of my trans friends both guy and girl.   nah, having way more fun showing you how wrong and bigoted you are. medical science says trans people exist. and unqualified person like you is saying we dont. lemme seeeeee...... i'll go with medical science!   you're not rendering an opinion, you're intentionally misgendering a trans person. and that is the very definition of transphobia.    you're welcome!   http://www.nature.com/news/sex-redefined-1.16943  not just about the chromosomes    actually, no, because there isnt any medical science backing up your claim. try again.   I SUMMON YOU GOD TO APPEAR BEFORE ME.  aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaand nothing happens.  therefore, i posit that there is no god. should i have gone wrong somewhere in my methodology, please advise on what i have to change in order to summon a god.   actually, that kinda is, when you reduce a person to their genitals.   well, several medical associations would beg to differ with you  **American Medical Association**   Resolution: Removing Financial Barriers to Care for Transgender Patients (2008)   An established body of medical research demonstrates the effectiveness and medical necessity of mental health care, hormone therapy and sex reassignment surgery as forms of therapeutic treatment for many people diagnosed with GID Therefore, be it RESOLVED, that the AMA supports public and private health insurance coverage for  treatment of gender identity disorder. http://www.tgender.net/taw/ama_resolutions.pdf   Resolution H-185.950: Removing Financial Barriers to Care for Transgender Patients (2008)   Our AMA supports public and private health insurance coverage for treatment of gender identity disorder as recommended by the patients physician.

Recognizes that appropriately evaluated transgender and gender variant individuals can benefit greatly from medical and surgical gender transition treatments.   2. Advocates for removal of barriers to care and supports both public and private health insurance coverage for gender transition treatment.   3. Opposes categorical exclusions of coverage for such medically necessary treatment when prescribed by a physician.    www.psychiatry.org/File%20Library/Advocacy%20and%20Newsroom/Position%20Statements/ps2012_TransgenderCare.pdf   Position Statement on Discrimination Against Transgender and Gender Variant Individuals (2012)    Being transgender gender or variant implies no impairment in judgment, stability, reliability, or general social or vocational capabilities; however, these individuals often experience discrimination due to a lack of civil rights protections for their gender identity or expression Thus, this position statement is relevant to the APA because discrimination and lack of equal civil rights is damaging to the mental health of  transgender and gender variant individuals.    **The American Psychiatric Association:**   1. Supports laws that protect the civil rights of transgender and gender variant individuals.   2. Urges the repeal of laws and policies that discriminate against transgender and gender variant individuals.   3. Opposes all public and private discrimination against transgender and gender variant individuals in such areas as health care, employment, housing, public accommodation, education, and licensing.   4. Declares that no burden of proof of such judgment, capacity, or reliability shall be placed upon these individuals greater than that imposed on any other persons. www.psychiatry.org/File%20Library/Advocacy%20and%20Newsroom/Position%20Statements/ps2012_TransgenderDiscrimination.pdf  American Psychological Association Policy on Transgender, Gender Identity   Gender Expression Non-Discrimination (2008) As stated in the Policy on Transgender, Gender Identity   Gender Expression NonDiscrimination, the APA opposes all public and private discrimination on the basis of actual or perceived gender identity and expression and urges the repeal of discriminatory laws and policies and calls upon psychologists in their professional roles to provide appropriate, nondiscriminatory treatment to transgender and gender variant individuals and encourages psychologists to take a leadership role in working against discrimination towards transgender and gender variant individuals.   The APA recognizes the efficacy, benefit and medical necessity of gender transition treatments for appropriately evaluated individuals and calls upon public and private insurers to cover these medically necessary treatments.   http://www.apa.org/about/policy/transgender.aspx  **American Academy of Family Physicians**   Resolution No. 1004 (2012) In 2007, an AAFP Commission declared that the association has a policy opposing any form of patient discrimination and stated its opposition to the exclusion of transgender health care.

I find it funny that you are mocking Fox News for mocking a man pretending to be a woman.  that you like belittling and invalidating trans people.   you would ;-)   no, but i can express how much i detest your opinion   and in return we get to tell you how much we disagree with you. gotta love that whole freedom of speech. you're free to share your opinion, but so am i.   stereotyping by referring to all the times they have actually BEEN the biggest asshats on the planet? i think that's just stating facts.   or, you know, just refer to the DSM V, you know the big book of medical answers that the doctors refer to in order to come to a diagnosis.  In the upcoming fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), people whose gender at birth is contrary to the one they identify with will be diagnosed with gender dysphoria.

This diagnosis is a revision of DSM-IVs criteria for gender identity disorder and is intended to better characterize the experiences of affected children, adolescents, and adults.   sex and gender are two different things. sex is who you go to bed with, gender is who you go to bed as.   hey, if Prince can do it....   she, you gotta use female pronouns now   lots of us love her. she done a whole lot to change people's attitudes in a VERY short amount of time.   the artist formerly known as bruce jenner   i would like if the whole world had this attitude to trans people. it would make my life a whole lot better, as opposed to constantly being asked what parts i happen to have under my dress.   the process is different from state to state. some states allow for change of name and gender by court order, some by doctor's letter. some states will allow you to change the gender on your birth certificate, some dont, some allow you to change it only if you have had reassignment surgery.  i live in california, so my name and gender change was pretty easy, i made an appointment at the court, went before the judge and got a court ordered name and gender change. i then went to the dmv and the social security office and gave them the court order and they changed my name and gender.   same with the bank. and all the other agencies i had to deal with, power company, phone, internet, insurance, etc.   the artist formerly known as bruce jenner   [not just you](http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/06/01/jessica-lange-learns-about-caitlyn-jenner-comparisons-that-s-so-wonderful.html?source=TDB via=FB_Page)   please be civil and respectful   please keep it civil   i'm just concerned that the baby transies will go in there, hear someone say "hey take this dose" and think that it's a one-size-fits-all kinda deal. you know how impatient some of us are to start.   i just want to make sure that they know what the risks are of self-medding AND give them all the info they need if they choose to do it anyway.    spoken like someone with no clue about what it means to be transgender.   like i said, it's totally condescending to women, and it prioritizes the man's needs above that of the woman's. the whole tone is demeaning and dismissive of women.   now who's taking stuff out of context.   i know why the admins did it, it's obviously to cover their ass. but people actually DO go to /r/asktransgender for medical advice. and i just want to be sure that people know that we arent doctors and that even if we were, we still couldnt advise them without examining them in the first place.   we all know people who self-med, either because they couldnt spend one more day as the gender they werent, or because they had no access to meds.   at the same time, there's no one standard dose because everybody's body is different.  i think if people know the entire range of dosages available as well as what a typical person's hormone range is, then they'll have enough info to make a decision.     the whole article is condescending to women, as if only the man's needs are paramount. it's all about how to get her in the mood so she consents. if she  says no, then it means no.   hey, sorry for piggygreenfingers' comments. lots of us struggle with weight. but my take on it is that you should think of your health first. i know lots of girls (and guys) who have lost lots of weight after coming out. amazing what not constantly thinking about your gender will do for your happiness. we all have the fear of not passing. i had it for the first year before i relaxed enough to see that if everybody else around me was gendering me female, then i should too.   - **Rule 2: Be respectful.** No bigotry (transphobia, homophobia, sexism, racism, etc); no hateful speech or disrespectful commentary; no personal attacks; no [gendered slurs](/r/asktransgender/wiki/genderedslurs); no [invalidation](/r/asktransgender/wiki/invalidation); no [gender policing](/r/asktransgender/wiki/genderpolicing).  - **Rule 3: No personal agendas.** /r/asktransgender is a place for discussion and is not a soapbox.

The biographer John Toland noted Hitler's anticlericalism but considered him still in "good standing" with the Church by 1941   then did you not read in the same wiki  In Mein Kampf, Hitler makes a number of religious allusions, claiming to be "acting in accordance with the will of the Almighty Creator" and to have been chosen by providence.[14][20] In a 1922 speech he said,"My feelings as a Christian points me to my Lord and Savior as a fighter [...] who [...] recognized these Jews for what they were and summoned men to fight against them..."[21] In a 1928 speech, he said: "We tolerate no one in our ranks who attacks the ideas of Christianity ... in fact our movement is Christian."   hitler was christian   they lost their collective marbles over constantine   not on tv   pssst, there is no god.   holy shitballs, people talk about it all the time, but going thru it is an experience unto itself. wow. blew my fucking mind.   whoooooo boy, do you ever feel. before i started on estrogen, it was like i was watching a black and white tv with the volume turned all the way down. once i started, it was like technicolor went wild and i was living in willy wonka land with neon colored flashing light and the music cranked up to 11. i remember having to pull over to the side of the freeway just to have a good cry for no apparent reason. i gradually became used to it, and i exist in a happy medium right now, but i feel way more emotion than i did before. thank god.  but again, everybody's body is different, so ymmv   here, try this  http://www.cheatsheet.com/personal-finance/these-insurers-offer-transgender-health-care-coverage.html/?a=viewall   this should help  http://www.cheatsheet.com/personal-finance/these-insurers-offer-transgender-health-care-coverage.html/?a=viewall   because i look NOTHING like a male anymore  http://imgur.com/a/l65Jh   *sigh*  did i also mention that i was trans? flying back with a male passport will be kinda sucky. blech.   now you just made me hungry   singaporean here too, i left a long long time ago. maybe one day i'll go back, but it'll be for the food and nothing else. mmmmmmmm. god i miss the food.   psssst.....  there is no god   it's always a god for you. cant you see that it's a better world when you realize that there is no god? that you have but one life to live.  you could have easily ended the convo hours ago, by simply pointing out proof, ANY proof that your god exists. you havent, so we go on dancing. i'm quite enjoying this. i can to tell you that there is no god, and there's nothing you can do about it, because you know i'm right.   amazing isnt it? one simple statement of fact as opposed to reams and reams of oratory as priests and pastors struggle to try and convince the flock every weekend that there is a god when half of them dont believe it themselves.  so, in conclusion, i submit, yet again, that there is no god.   you're welcome, any time i can help a struggling theist be comfortable with the fact that there is no god, i consider a successful day.  here are some resources if you need.  http://atheists.org/activism/resources   then i'd suggest the LA Children's Hospital. they have the biggest and best trans child unit in the country   http://www.chla.org/site/c.ipINKTOAJsG/b.7501767/#.VWwD7s9Viko   call this guy   Luis Moreno   323-361-5372   lumoreno@chla.usc.edu  if you dont get a hold of him by phone, email him, he'll go over all the requirements with you. they have a therapist you can talk to, and dr olsen is great. they have a tiny group meeting every wednesday during the day if you can make it.   yeah, the one thing that surprised me was how much it affected some people. one of my really good, really old friends pretty much had the same reaction as your friend did.   you have to give them a moment to have a moment. they go thru the same stages of grief as you would losing somebody. it's silly, but that's what happens.  you've had years to think this over, it's ALL new to them, and it can be a little overwhelming. i cant tell you how surprised i was when a few of my friends needed MY support in dealing with it.  cracked me up to no end.  so just give your friend a little time. just talk thru their fears, try and make them see that they're not losing you at all. it'll still be you, just in a body that you're more comfortable in.   well, call the la lgbt center, they have a great trans program and they're very knowledgeable. are you under 25? do you have insurance? a yes to both those questions means you could go thru the LA Children's hospital. they're great too. also, there's a group that meets every friday at the la lgbt center, be good for you if you want to hang around a bunch of trans people.    yup, i sure do. doesnt stop me from liking other girls too. that one is just the one at the top.   who said anything about denying people? my last girlfriend was asian, the girlfriend before that was dark haired russian. my current girlfriends are white, but both of them are brunette. all i said was that i prefer blonds. again, merely stating a preference.   we are both atheists, i merely believe in one less god than you. come, just let go of one more god. it'll be ok, there are other who live their life by logic and science.   just repeat after me   there is no god   please be respectful, and civil.   nah, why waste time   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moSFlvxnbgk  come be one with the unbelievers, we can help you. all you need to do is let it go.   lmao, this deep into the thread, and all you had to do to end it was to show me proof of god. you havent. isnt it time you stopped believing in a faerie tale? come out as an unbeliever, we have great cookies. you cannot prove your god exists. it would be the easiest way to convert people. show us he exists. and we'll follow. light all the candles, sing all the hymn.   god doesnt exist. never has. never will.  amen.   no, only dating white girls because you believe that the white race is superior and all other races should bow before you and kiss the ground you walk on is racist. me? i just have a preference for blonds.    feel free   it's ok to let go of the idea of god. i know it's scary, it always is to let go of something that you've thought was solid bedrock, only to see, once the wool has been taken away from your eyes, to be nothing more than shifting sand.  it's ok.   it'll be ok.  let go of your god and let him drift away on the wind that created him in teh first place.  come be with the free folk, those of us who live life fully engaged in the world, where we live for THIS life, because we know that this is the only life we get.   prove god exists, otherwise, no god exists. pretty simple, eh?   well, i did it the way i knew how, but obviously i must have done something wrong. could you please point out where i went wrong? perhaps a summoning spell is in order? this is the only way i know how to prove that a god does not exist.      you're welcome   ah, so you can prove that a god exists, good, now we're getting somewhere. how does one prove the existence of god.   you called it "fake genitalia", it's not  you said that post-op vaginas are incapable of self-lubrication, they are  you said we shouldnt expect to be able to fully orgasm, that's incorrect  so pretty much your entire post.   well, let's review shall we? you've asked me to prove that there is no god, which i have. but you seem to disagree with my methods of summoning a god. so i have repeatedly asked you what the proper way of summoning a god is, which you have not provided. failing that, i've asked you how you can prove that there is a god, but i'm still waiting for that proof.   again, should you provided me a single shred of evidence that a god exists, i will happily change my mind. isnt that what you are called to do in your faith? well, i'm asking. please prove that your god exists, and i will add my name to the roster of true believers.  CAN I GET AN AMEN???   Please be respectful    again, my apologies if i did something wrong, i am more than happy to correct my ways. if you can show me how to summon a god, i will be happy to do so.  you asked me to prove that there is no god, and i showed you the way i test it. if you have a test that shows otherwise, i'll be happy to change my mind.   easy, if god is with me, i summon them into a form of a storm cloud in the shape of a unicorn with three legs.  nope. nothing happened.  so, therefore, god does not exist.  again, if i'm doing something wrong in summoning him, i'd be open to suggestions on the correct way of summoning a god.   you mean this kind of "treatment"?  http://www.people.com/article/inside-josh-duggar-treatment-    you're entitled to your opinion, but it just seemed like you were really down on cis people.   look, some people have a type, i, for example, like blondes, and white girls. it's a preference. not all chasers are bad. i'm VERY attracted to trans girls. altho the invites i've received thru OKCupid are a thing of beauty to behold. lots of them are pretty much "does your dick still work? cuz if yes, that's hot, wanna fuck?"   well that i agree with, but you've had a pretty negative tone when you've commented about cis people.    please be respectful   so get yourself a nice trans girl who likes to use hers. problem solved!   well yeah, it is kinda out of the ordinary to tell people that you're trans. we're such a small minority of the population. i've had non-stop convos with people at parties when i tell them. it's a great icebreaker. i can just keep going thru the whole party. met some really great people that way.   lol, get used to not getting your way. just because we will not tolerate your intolerance. go spread the hate somewhere else. the rest of us will happily get along without religion.   http://www.hrc.org/resources/entry/americans-overwhelmingly-support-executive-action-to-ban-anti-lgbt-workplac  i respectfully disagree with your assessment. i dont know what it was in your past that has turned you so against cis people, but i count a great many cis people as my friends, and they have been nothing but supportive.  and, according to the poll, so are most americans.   yeah, you kinda left out the conversion therapy places, the jesus camps. the pastors, the christian leaders.   there will always be people who have been hurt, badly, and will always see the negative. we can only respond with positives and try to bring them around.   even our own allies have been known to be transphobic. stephen colbert as well, conan o'brien. conan used the t-slur and when people complained, he apologized immediately saying that he didnt know it was a slur and that it would never be used on the show again. it made me so happy to hear.   so yes, i will always give people the benefit of the doubt.   most of the cis people i've told have been confused, but positive in their reactions. i've had one or two bible thumpers tell me i'm going to hell, but i just chalk it up to religious brainwashing.    dont confuse a lack of understanding with transphobia, i know it may be frustrating to have to do trans 101 over and over again, but even with all the trans coverage in the media, there are still some people who dont get it.  i DO agree with you about some people being transphobic. i've got some internalized transphobia myself with recent MtF transitioners. i catch myself ALL the time. it's not something that i'm proud of, but i try to push thru it.   they werent hiding behind religion, now were they? the great atrocities were done in the name of religion      And it was.   no it wasnt. the proper treatment would have been to report it to the authorities and have him immediately taken away for treatment. AWAY from the other girls so that he couldnt assault others. THAT is the proper treatment.   it's all good, i know some things really get us going.   dont diss the cis. we cant win this war without our cis allies. while it is true that cis people have a hard time understanding what it means to be trans, not all of them are actively working against us.   hey, i know things can get heated sometimes, but please refrain from personal attacks, i'm going to tell /u/evendeathmaydie the same thing   easy as pie  I SUMMON YOU GOD  nothing happened  there, i just proved that god does not exist.    How many "underage" girls did YOU try to "molest" when you were 14-17 years old?  for me and millions of other kids, none. what josh duggar did was a sexual assault. and instead of getting caught and sent for treatment, his parents did nothing. for the girls who were assaulted, NOTHING was done. and for you to try and defend such a sexual assault as a normal course of puberty is absolutely disgusting.    the jews sent to the camps were poles, hungarians, germans, italians, french, austrian, ukranian, etc. it was an attempt to exterminate an entire religion.   power corrupts, absolute power corrupts absolutely   http://infidels.org/library/modern/jim_meritt/bible-contradictions.html  http://www.project-reason.org/gallery3/image/105/  knock yourself out.  the bible has more holes than swiss cheese. and it's got so many versions that nobody knows what the hell it originally looked like.   there are none so blind as those that will not see  	189
 Two very different characters.   As the title states, I believe someone should make a subreddit where users who have been killed by hackers on a server can go make a Text Post and request for a person to come and try and kill the hacker.   Kind of makes farming seem pointless.   I remember my least favourite encounter with a hacker in DayZ, I was running along, SKS on my back, suddenly, in the corner I see "I have emptied my SKS" then my character opens a pipsi and drinks it, just a as a really cool bandit looking character appeared and headshotted me with his fully customized M4. *I hate hackers*   Just join another server if you see this.   I don't believe this is your first adventure.   You may give away your position if you like hiding, because apparently eating human meat is funny.   "Nothing in DayZ is forever" -FrankieOnPCin1080p 2012   Nope. They don't say what GPU it has.   This is so true, when admin Logs come out admins will check who killed them, then ban their killer.   Probably just a duper wanting to get his friends some AK's.   *Well fuck physics*   Instead of dragging it when you can see it on the left, double click it and it moves it to the first available slot that the item can fit into.   I am about 99% Admin Logs aren't out yet.   Do I replace the X's in the code?   Same here, except DayZ has more towns, so it is a little different.   Also while along the coast you can use train tracks.   Did you also get cancer from that?   Oh jesus, you obviously don't have the upperhand in a gunfight.   Which part? *All of it*  	20
 [SMERSH](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMERSH) was real.    ... or not so simple, if that's available. But I would be fine with simple (10-year-old Java level) right now.      It also doesn't take into account the issue of land-values, on which productivity has no effect.  Productivity does affect land value. For example, after the invention of the elevator and modern building techniques, the value of land in or near a city increased dramatically due to the fact you can fit more people and/or make more products with the same amount of land than you could previously.  Likewise, the Internet and telepresence technology has affected land value, but in the opposite direction (reducing demand)   Did I mention that in the Spanish reddit (meneame) 90% of the comments are from people that seemingly would support a Leninist state?  Haha, if they actually get a Leninist state, they can kiss all that welfare goodbye:  "The first principle of Socialism is: He who does not work, does not eat." -Lenin         Thoughts thinking "I am" is man  when labels cause actions are they just labels, or have they become something more?  what sees that there is nothing to be defended? does nothing see itself? If so, has it remained nothing, or has being now appeared?  life, in just living, becomes more than itself.         Snow does not think "I am snow," but  man thinks "I am man," so  when this thought occurs,  what is happening?    When Life turns to see itself,  is it the controller, or the controlled?  Both or neither? Or,  is something more mysterious happening,   a hall of mirrors that leads to awakening?   There might be a mint there, but only if you can get past the media screaming about "ebonics" or some such nonsense. I can just imagine Limbaugh now: "New fake IQ test racist against whites! Makes blacks seem smart when they're not!"  As other posters mentioned, this is really a non-issue: Murray's own data shows economic status was the determining variable, not race, even if we admit "race" as a coherent, measurable concept, which I and most scientists have serious doubts about anyway. Remember there was a time when Italians and Jews were not considered "white," and now they are.   I agree, but that's not the conclusion he drew in the book.   He also fails to mention the rise of the war on drugs, and the increasingly large portion of the black male population that is in jail.  He did note that he focused exclusively on whites to avoid "ethnic issues." But the fact that this guy's book is called "The State of White America" raises the creepy level in the room just a bit. If this is the same Charles Murray who wrote "The Bell Curve," which suggested that blacks "naturally" have an IQ level 15 points below whites, it all starts to fit together. He's not worried about blacks because he thinks they're beyond hope anyway.                  The Dry Tortugas are indeed in the Caribbean. This is a different island with a similar name. "Tortuga" is Spanish for "turtle."            I would prefer to use the term "strength of effect" when referring to a linear coefficient, and I would prefer that it be used in replacement of or at least along with correlation when reporting how variables are linked.      Only in our Galaxy.   In terms of pure math, you are correct, but when the general public hears the words "strongly correlated," that's not what they think. It is possible, after all to have some form of cancer be "strongly correlated" with weight, and yet have it that a 160 lb. person has a 2.1% chance of the cancer whereas a 250 lb. person has a 2.2% chance of the cancer. In cases like these unit invariance is irrelevant - reporting such a link as "strongly correlated" is misleading, even though technically accurate.   No... part of what it's showing is you get the same correlation value for many different patterns. Even if you just look at linear patterns, you can get the same correlation value with radically different slopes on the best-fit line. Two quantities can have a correlation of close to 1 (which would seem to imply a strong relation) and yet still be only weakly related in reality if the slope of the best-fit line is close to 0.               Eminent?      Makes sense. Thanks.   As a side note, some speculate that, because of two rivers that don't flow anymore, the Garden of Eden was located at the bottom of the Persian Gulf.  Fully accepting that this is whako, I would like some elaboration on this point nonetheless.   Thanks for the link. What do you mean by "abandon determinism"?   Plain English as much as possible, please. I can deal with *some* equations but nothing too heavy. Thanks!      It's not explained why it freaks me out.   Cartoons in general, especially old cartoons. The Macy's balloons really creep me out.               I don't really think you get what I'm trying to say. Read the other posts in this thread, they explain it better than I do.  The point is, 0!=1 is not a "tack on" that has nothing to do with the rest of the definition of a factorial and is just there for convenience so we don't end up dividing by zero. It is implied by the original definition.   Then the same can be argued about any mathematical function. It's not a "convention" in the way that placing the dependent variable on the left-hand side of an equation is a "convention."  0!=1 is suggested by the underlying concept itself, not just inherited tradition.   It's a convention, not a theorem. It's been chosen like that because it's useful.  No, that is not correct, it is in the structure of the idea of the factorial. Think of a baseball team of x players. There are x! ways for the coach to order them on a bench for photo. Now imagine if the coach simply wanted a picture of the empty bench (0 players.) There is only one way to order that photo. Therefore 0!=1  A similar argument can be made for the "inevitability" of such seemingly "hacky" definitions such as a^0 = 1.                     The reaction uses a secret catalyst  Stopped reading right there. Just another Cold Fusion scam and-or self-delusion.   I don't think we need any fancy Category Theory to solve this problem as some other posters have suggested.  You merely have to distinguish between declarable and constructable entities. For example, I can *declare* "a square circle" by saying these words, but I could never actually construct one.  Similarly, in Set Theory we can say "The set of all sets," but it is not clear if we mean declarable or constructable sets. The set of all declarable sets includes some sets which trigger Russel's Paradox, and thus are not constructable.  When a mathematician is saying "all sets this, all sets that," he is most likely referring to the set of all *constructable* sets.    Why a vow to free beings - or even just one's own being- if there are no beings to free?  Empty of *inherent* selfhood does not mean total emptiness of being, but rather than our selves are unavoidably dependent on the existence of other beings (dependent origination.)  So this is where the vow originates to free all beings - it cannot be any other way, since all being is tied up together.   I wasn't going as far back as Smith - just pointing out that Libertarianism was around when any person living today was in High School.   True, but if you have to have a graphic metaphor, horseshoe beats grid. Libertarianism, if not the modern Party, has been around quite some time. The grid metaphor got started as the "Nolan Chart." Nolan was a Libertarian.      Because as any high school politics student knows, political alignments are not on a line (they're more on a grid, with x and y coordinates, etc.)   I'm more of a "horseshoe" guy. I think that grid is Libertarian propaganda: "Wow, look, there's a party that believes in *both* types of freedom!"   Right and left are labels given by American propagandists in the McCarthy era.  No, they come from where the factions sat in the French National Assembly after the Revolution.  His mistake was making his country a socialist dictatorship (communism), rather than a socialist republic.  I don't think he had a choice once he seized power. The majority of the Russian people in 1917 were rural and religious. They would not have voted for Bolshevism if given the chance. A Tolstoy-style religious socialism might have had a better shot.   Doesn't matter what they actually do or the fact that social programs are not 'socialism'  Yes, I like how people do not get that social programs are actually a phenomenon of capitalism. There is no welfare in Socialism because everyone is guaranteed a job (and compelled to work.)   I'm not saying that's a *good* thing, but welfare is Capitalism *preserving* itself from a possible Socialist uprising.  One of Lenin's slogans was "He who does not work, does not eat." Makes him sound like a Tea Party guy, which he was in some strange way, that way the far left and the far right always seem to converge.    Elaborate perhaps?      Turkey pasta. Better than it sounds.    Politics has always contained a transcendental element (often a phony one used as a lure, but that's a different issue.) In terms of an incentive, few things beat the promise or even the hope of transcendence.   "the flawed, selfish nature of man" is a religious percept.  Maybe, but also a Darwinian one. I don't think you can ignore that without socialization to the contrary, human beings care about themselves, their "tribe," and little else.   The simple man wonders what's for dinner.  The wise man ponders the mysteries of the cosmos.  The Enlightened man wonders what's for dinner.   It was probably similar to those old questions on the SAT about culture-specific stuff that were designed to keep Jews out of Harvard. Taffy is probably something poor Koreans don't see much of.   The school system can fail kids without repercussions if needed. The budget isn't set according to how many students graduate.   This is key. In the US there is tremendous pressure on teachers to pass everyone because funding and ratings are based on "on-time" graduation rates.               [Part I: If you don't like it, leave](http://evolvify.com/free-academic-journal-papers-and-scientific-studies/)  [Part II: The Libertarianism Question](http://evolvify.com/hunter-gatherer-paleo-philosophy-libertarianism/)   My only disappointment was getting to the bottom and finding out Qu8k isn't for sale (yet...)                  Very interesting. Thanks for the response. One thing you said in particular caught my eye:  There are castes among Christians and Muslims too.   We often read in the Western media that low-caste Hindus and Dalits are converting to Islam or Christianity to escape the caste system. Is that exaggerated or false in your view?    I know some Hindus (and a former one) who would disagree with you. It is true though that there is no central authority in Hinduism, so different groups might have different interpretations.   By and large though, Hinduism is an inherited tradition. You can't just go sign up to become Hindu like you can for some other religions. The "Western Hindu" groups like the Hare Krishnas and the Rajneeshis are considered fake, heretical or just plain laughable by (most) actual Hindus.   Assuming "The West" means the current hegemonic system lead by the United States, I would advise you to beware the "rhetoric of decline" which is used for political manipulation and doesn't really represent the underlying reality. The US is still the world's largest manufacturer, food exporter and its military technology is light-years ahead of anyone else's.  Unfortunately a number of commenters here have bought in to this rhetoric full-scale. For example, one stated:  china and other nations find themselves with a young strong backbone   China does not have a young, strong backbone. They overshot their population decades ago, experienced apocalyptic levels of starvation several times, and are still paying the price. Their demographics are completely upside down now and the very old will soon outnumber those of working age.  I wouldn't be surprised if the US, Latin America and India form the power troika of 40 years hence while China, Japan and Europe all suffer greatly just from demographic pressure alone.   The US will probably no longer be the lone superpower c. 2050 but it's quite possible it will still be one of the top dogs.    American Indians can be Hindus too if they want  Not Orthodox. You have to be born in the caste system to be considered Hindu. They could always be Hare Krishnas or something though.            I suspected it might be something like this. However, would it be possible to create substances that are *digestible*, but, for whatever reason, don't give any energy to the body and/or cannot be stored as fat? Or would that create metabolic havoc?         Aren't sugars carbohydrates?            ...and actually went batshit crazy. she got obsessed with "decoding the codes within the bible."  Are you sure she just wasn't watching the History Channel?  she ended up naked in the parking lot of Lambeau Field with permanent marker and things like Jesus = Mary = Joesph equations solved in unintelligable math  Ok, maybe not.    The government of Zimbabwe is pretty powerful, at least internally. Just ask all their political prisoners and dispossessed farmers.   If relatively harmless drugs like marijuana were legal, people wouldn't do this synthetic stuff. It should be banned, but then, pot should be legal as well.   That's my point though. Habitual drug users with no history of violence all of a sudden go nuts when they use this stuff. It might be close chemically to THC but in terms of reaction it's more like PCP. It's a drug that is a danger to the public, not just to its users.   [Here is one story](http://www.wwaytv3.com/2011/09/01/one-dead-another-custody-after-overnight-shooting-rocky-point). You can find plenty more searching police registers and medical journals.   There was a case in a town near ours of a guy high on "bath salts" who tunneled into his neighbor's basement trying to kill him because he thought the guy was having sex with his wife. He had been a longtime marijuana user with no criminal record beyond possession and no history of mental illness.  Part of the problem with "bath salts" is they can be many different chemicals - you don't know what you're getting. I agree with a previous poster who said if marijuana was legal none of this would be happening, because most often this stuff is advertized as "legal pot" and sold in skate shops, head shops, etc. which pot users frequent.   He argues that a gold standard would force the government back into the price-fixing business. Not sure that's correct, but an interesting perspective.   Do you know anyone who's done this stuff? I'm fine with people using drugs that kill them, not so fine with them using drugs that cause them to go nuts and kill other people.    This stuff is bad news. Lifelong potheads have tried it once and ended up in the loony bin. For once I don't have a problem with the DEA.      don' think human nature is very malleable (which is the most basic idea of any kind of socialism: that people are programmed by relations and circumstances)  Good post, but I'd disagree with you there. Many Socialists believe there is a basic unchangeable human nature, for example Marx's idea of "primitive Communism" representing the original state of Man that will eventually reappear in the final state.  In this view Capitalism is the temporary, un-natural aberration which is part of the reason why it will collapse.         I paid $8.50 for a birthday card at Hallmark. 99 cent store will be getting my greeting card business in the future.   True, but you can often counter-sue for damages that include your legal fees. I don't know how often that succeeds though.      Thanks, but it doesn't appear to be on the soundtrack. It was just background music to a few of the fights - the chanting might not have even been part of the "official" music track at all, I just really dug the combination.      Yeah, not quite what I had in mind, but thanks.   I heard such music in the background of a show (Soul Eater) and can't get the idea out of my head. Can't track down the artist though.    Ah, it looks like only the first two parts are posted with more to come tomorrow. Sorry guys. I liked the first two parts so much I posted before I realized that was all there was.                  It has not been established that the original speakers of IE are related genetically to the majority of today's speakers. The language is thought to have spread more from prestige influence and trade than military conquest, except in its earliest spread into the Danube Valley, where there is evidence of warfare.  So it's not like "some black people speak French" and more like "most people who speak French are unrelated to the original French nation, which we know very little about anyway since it ceased to exist 5000 years ago."   I don't think you can conflate "Aryan" and "white." The original people who used the word "Arya" probably were lighter-skinned, since they were from the steppes of Russia, but there are non-IE-speaking people who have light skin also, such as the Finns and Hungarians, and many darker-skinned people who speak IE languages and practice a descendant of the "Aryan" religion (most Hindus, for example.) IE is a language group, not a race.      "Arya" was a word in certain branches of Satem Indo-European that meant "priest," "aristocrat," or "practitioner of the correct religion or correct rituals" depending on the context. It was not used to mean "tribe" or "race."   It is much more correct to speak of an Aryan religion that is the ancestor of both Vedic Hinduism and Zoroastrianism than an Aryan race.    Cash did claim God gave him that song in a dream when he was high on Quaaludes, for what it's worth.   Yes, but depth like this is why people like it.         Here in Michigan the private schools pay for their own buses, textbooks, etc...  Are you sure? I thought that was true in my state as well until a state senator told me otherwise. I was pretty shocked that my taxes pay to bus, heat and equip religious schools.  Have coaches teach gym class.   They usually do, but they get a separate salary for coaching, at least in most districts in my area.  Require any part of the uniform that isn't customized to be returned at the end of the year (specifically, pants).  Haha, do you know what football uniforms look like by the end of the season? Usually there are multiple uniforms per player for each season because they rip and wear out.  private schools either learn to manage their finances REALLY well, or they disappear because they can't pay the bills.  Or they get the public to foot the bill for them, without any public oversight or standardized test "accountability" that public schools have to follow. Where I live, even some public schools are run by for-profit companies and are exempt from most state regulations, including the obligation to educate special-needs and learning-disabled students. It's sick.    How did these right winger Italians get to be so racist? You'd be hard pressed to find a more motley assortment of racial mixing than within the Italian peninsula.   You've answered your own question. Racial identity anxiety is known to be linked with increased racism. See the American South with its rampant underground "miscegenation" during the pre-Civil War period for another example.  Niall Ferguson covers this issue in [The War of the World](http://www.amazon.com/War-World-Twentieth-Century-Conflict-Descent/dp/1594201005) - the book can be a bit dry but the section on racial anxiety is well worth reading.   Prior to the Putsch, as I understand it, the Nazis were a legal party from 1925 onwards TO the Putsch.  The Beer Hall Putsch was in 1923, you've got it backwards. They were briefly banned (and Hitler was jailed under cushy conditions), but legalized again in 1925.      At least in my state, joining the union is voluntary. That may not be true everywhere.   Actually, public districts are required by law (at least in my state) to bus private students as well, and even pay for the textbooks and heating costs of private schools (except for religious textbooks.)  Sports cost more than you think - coaches are paid in most districts, uniforms, league fees and transportation are expensive, as is insurance, and "the field" in sports-crazy towns is often more like a minor-league stadium. Then there's the marching band - I know for a fact a large district near me has a marching band budget of nearly $100,000 per year.  Disputes over grades and discipline should be handled by the teacher and the student's family, and maybe the school authorities if necessary. When it comes to grade disputes, parents should be required to provide evidence that their student did not earn the grade received or that the assignment was graded unfairly.  Here I agree with you, but that's not the reality of how things work these days.    Salaries of union officials come from union dues, not district budgets.      You're probably right about the present time, there is more violent indoctrination among Muslims. However, most Muslims - ever very conservative ones - specifically forbid attacks on civilians, Muslims or not, and if you've seen movies like "Jesus Camp" you will know that Christians have "madrassas" of their own.      Only if you restrict your time frame considerably. Over the long frame of history I'd say both religions are equally bloodthirsty.   He is an [Obscurantist](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obscurantist#Restricting_knowledge) - he doesn't personally believe in the religion, but he thinks it is necessary for social cohesion.  Of course the media won't use that term... it's too, well, obscure.   Don't forget: They can expel disruptive students. Public schools cannot (unless they have committed an actual crime, like dealing drugs or assault, and even then sometimes they are only kicked out for 6 months or a year.)   A lot of times, the administrators are the Creationists. That's the small-town reality.   I'm all for paying teachers more, but where the hell is all that money going?  Administration, sports, legal costs (districts are sued constantly when they dare to actually fail or discipline kids), busing costs (no public transportation in most areas means districts maintain huge bus fleets of their own), physical plant (there are a lot of $100M-plus HS buildings in the US with terrible academics).   Save money and hire an inexpensive recent grad. Look good to the school board and the negative affects aren't seen until you've hopped to a different job. This BS goes on all the time in Nursing as well which is why unions are popular in both professions.   Those sorts of salaries are extremely unusual for public education. They do exist in some very wealthy districts, though.   Yep. Given the attitudes towards education in the US, without unions teachers would be earning close to minimum wage, and the jobs would be filled without regard to qualifications or knowledge at all, and would require a political connection to get.  (This all describes how most teaching jobs were actually filled in the early 60's and before, before the union movement really got started.)   Yeah, I get that sensory "vagueness" also, except with visuals which are very clear.   I was surprised to read that there is no smell or taste in dreams because that part of the brain is shut off during REM sleep. But come to think of it, I've never experienced smell or taste in a dream.  If this is legit, it could be a very effective way to check to see if you're dreaming. So my question is - has anyone experienced smell or taste in dreams?  I'm headed to bed to test the theory myself...  **UPDATE:** Didn't work. I ate a whole box of chocolates, and I thought I was tasting them, although, upon awakening, I couldn't recall the taste. So, maybe there is no taste in dreams, but if you *think* you're tasting anyway, it's useless as a reality check.      The Ice Age was over 10,000 years ago. It did not end in the Middle Ages.      I read somewhere you would only need 50 digits of pi to compute the circumference of a circle to the nearest millimeter when it had a radius as big as the Universe, but I don't know whether or not that's true.   Also, I've always been curious if there is a similar series definition for pi. Wikipedia was not much help on either subject.   test_subject7829   "The History of Rome" podcast is currently about 60 hours overall. The amount of work people put into these things for almost no reward other than the love of history is mind-boggling.                  If Time managed to out the Smurfs as secret CommieNazis, I can't *wait* to see the dirt they have on He-Man...   I came here to ask "how many years until it's all reality shows?" I think yours is a good estimate.   I'm skeptical that the Business Plot was real. Why would a bunch of right-wing businessmen approach an outspoken formal General who had already written a book called "War is a Racket" and had pacifist views to front their coup?  Either they had the worst research in the history of coups or Butler made the whole thing up for publicity.   Actually the people who made the TEC-9 are out of business because of such lawsuits, so it has worked at least once.               I believe they want government *inflation* targets, but not actual deflation. Not an economist either.   1933 for domestic drawers, 1971 for international (sovereign) drawers. It's complicated.   no one would suggest that the bartender who sold them the alcohol is the one responsible for the death.  Actually where I live, bartenders are legally responsible, so most bars take your keys at the door and you have to breathalyze before you get them back. We have among the lowest rate of alcohol-related driving injuries in the country, so it seems to work.   I do agree that there would be far fewer deaths if it could be sold on the open market.  Yes, but no one would want to sell it, because there still would be deaths, and the companies that made it would be sued out of existence unless they were given Congressional Immunity like the vaccine makers.  Then you'd just be back to your shady unreliable local "entrepreneur" just like now.   Absolutely correct, I was just demonstrating that probabilities can be calculated over infinite quantities.    If there are an infinite number of both, there is no way to start the argument  Sure there is - you can do probabilities over infinite quantities. For example, in almost all randomly chosen intervals on the set of natural numbers (which is infinite), you are more likely to pick a composite than a prime number, for example.   Not exclusively, though Marx did use it, and it is a term exclusive to the Left as far as I know (the Right would deny the very existence of rentiers.)   Thanks, this is the best explanation so far. I have another question for you: Is the Uncertainty Principle a *universal* principle of any conceivable universe, that is, is it a mathematical necessity? Or, are "Newtonian" Universes mathematically possible, but it just so happens that we don't live in one?  I asked this question on reddit before but no one seemed to have a good answer.   Actually, it only works if there *are* infinite universes, the way I understand it.    I've seen that before, but his definition of "nothing" was also "quantum foam," whatever that is. Not exactly "nothing" in the philosophical sense.   Is there a difference though between "quantum fluctuations" - which would seem to imply a pre-existing set of laws - and actual nothingness? Because Hawking clearly states "out of nothing."   There's good reason to think not. For example the ["Boltzmann's Brain"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boltzmann_brain) argument.            There were rumors about where Brokmeyer had gone; it was said he was conducting a Hegel-focused kindergarten class for the Creek Indians in the wilds of the Oklahoma territory. He assured his friends he was still alive by sending intricately whittled walking sticks to their St. Louis addresses.   Sometimes life is a Pynchon novel.        	186
 I am an Econ major and it seems like everyone works for a start up at one point in their time at NYU. Big tech firms also like to recruit from NYU ( I will be at one upon graduation ).

She'd grind that transmission to a pulp in Baton Rouge, Louisiana's stop-n-go traffic.   Really?  I didn't know they believed that.  Learned something new.

If a blind person doesn't really USE their eyes, do parts of the ocular system become "atrophied"?  That's kind of what I was thinking.   I wasn't sure what triggered the dilation.

Apparently, unlike everyone else in /r/Catholicism, I'm not 100% well-versed with the catechism.  I'm assuming from his/her comment that /u/o_hai_mark can quote it like the Bible.  ((eyeroll))   Let me play Devil's Advocate here... does the catechism ever describe self-pleasure as being a sin?   Good point!  Zedd is more of a "hippy", and loves food!      True. I do like the WoT series better overall... although it can be a tad too descriptive sometimes.  The SoT got a little repetitive and deus ex machina sometimes.   Not a problem for me with any embarrassing site, because I back all the way out, and purge my history every time I use my browser.   I'm gonna assume you mean:  "I am a servant of the Secret Fire, wielder of the flame of Anor. You cannot pass. The dark fire will not avail you, flame of Udn. Go back to the Shadow! You cannot pass."  Gandalf is making three very specific references as both warning and challenge to the Balrog. by identifying himself as a servant of the secret fire (or Flame impersishable), Gandalf is identifying himself as a Maiar, an embodied angelic servant of the Valar protecting the light of Creation that Eru Iluvatar (or God) has set to burn at the centre of Arda (Earth).  Wieldor of the flame of Anor is a reference to his ability to draw on the power of the sun possibly through the Ring of Fire Narya but maybe also through his own divine origins.  Finally as he refers to the Balrog as the Flame of Udun, he informs the Balrog that he knows it to be a corrupted Maiar in the service of Morgoth from the earliest time when he resided as Melkor in his dark fortress of Utumno broken by the Valar at the awakening of the Elves. He orders it to retreat (go back to the shadows) or face the consequences of divine conflict and final judgement before the Valar Mandos the fate of all slain creatures.

It says "celebrated" which is past tense.      "I love you."   Because it's an easy religion. It excuses pretty much any bad behavior.   A non-standard 9V battery I would assume.

 Couple of thoughts:  First some basics: Rice pasta is cheap and ubiquitous.  Rice breads are easy to find too, and not too expensive.  Order burgers with a lettuce wrap.  Rice / asian food is often your friend, but watch out for soy, which often contains gluten, however, you may be able to tolerate in small quantities.  If you're eating sushi, ask for tamari - many sushi places in big cities have this, but you have to ask.  Careful with steroids - oral prednisone  can cause bounce back.  Because your gut is most exposed, you get bounce back in the gut, which can lead to more food allergy.   Caananites, ancestors of modern Palestinians, predate the Israelites.   Are you talking about the state of Israel which was established by Irgun terrorists?   FN; DR.   Not when reality has a satirical bias.         "Hey guys, we need to do some human rights violations.  Sorry.  You can see yourselves out."            The point being that Israel is worse than Apartheid?    Yes.   I post about both.  I've long held the opinion that we ought not to be funding either.   Both primitive savage Islamic states and primitive savage Jewish states ought to be isolated.   Typical JPost garbage, perfectly illustrates pro-Israeli arguments:  ignore the main issue, the bombing of a densely packed open air prison filled with people whose homes have been stolen, and instead talk about lofty words in Israel's constitution.  This bit was particularly funny.   "Israel has never had laws that overtly discriminated between citizens on the basis of race."  There are more than 50 Israeli laws that discriminate against Palestinian citizens of Israel in all areas of life, including their rights to political participation, access to land, education, state budget resources, and criminal procedures. Some of the laws also violate the rights of Palestinians living in the 1967 OPT and Palestinian refugees.   http://adalah.org/eng/Israeli-Discriminatory-Law-Database     Sharia Bolsheviks  LOL.  Careful, your extreme right wing ideology is showing.      The middle class is disappearing and class polarization is growing.    Even if Noam Chomsky is correct, he still sort of comes off as a nutcase.  Seriously, this is totally useless name calling.    Chomsky often wanders into these broader schemes that no one can immediately relate to or even imagine.  Have you ever read any of his books, or are you just responding to hearing fragments from him?   If your experience is growing up in the United States over the past 30 years, he's going to sound like an alien from another planet.  But, if that's not the case - you grew up during or before the 70s or were born outside, he's not such a stretch.  In any case, what matters is not the feeling he gives you, but specific cases.  Look into the details.  Chomsky tends to defend his positions with powerful scholarship.   Does anyone remember Unclaimed Territory?  I remember thinking that someone had finally come to take the torch from Chomsky.  Greenwald has a different style and his work has a much more journalistic focus, but he reminds me of Chomsky's deconstructive approach, letting establishment figures convict themselves with their own words.    These critics feel very emotional about Greenwald, but can do  little other than resort to name calling and unsubstantiated allegations.     The people criticizing him for his recent reporting  like Karl Rove's dancing partner, David Gregory, or Jefferey Toobin, believe that the press should only report what the government wants them to.  Were it up to them, Daniel Ellesberg would have been in jail.     You forgot "and being consistently wrong"      They should know.

These mendacious hasbara efforts only serve to deepen  disgust for Israeli fascism.  The perception all over the world is that Israel, and Israelis, have turned into monsters, who steal, lie and kill, and then cry that *they* are the victims, even as they bomb the open air prison filled with those whose homes they stole.  Tell me again about those three Israeli kids.  What a joke.  All you are doing is cementing everyone's disgust at this country and its defenders.   You'll need a bath after fighting with this Hasbara troll.    Unfortunately, come November 2016, barring any "real" choice she will be yet another lesser of two evils.  I'm hoping Warren joins the race.  Without her, I agree, it's looking pretty bleak.   But, as I said, even Bernie wouldn't criticize Israel.  Disappointing, but such is the culture of fear the Lobby has created.  I can't really blame him or Warren for their votes, though I'm not happy with them.   Agree that the Israel lobby holds great sway, however, I don't think Clinton is any way *forced* into the kind of hawkish stance she's taken.  Israel's actions have been decried across the world and are described as war crimes by major human rights organizations, yet not a peep from her about moderation.     Very few are getting out as far ahead as Clinton is.  No one *forced* make the case for Israel, though they may be forced to take votes for them.  [Clinton is pushing the envelope here,  throwing her support behind far right policies.](http://www.mediaite.com/online/moveon-slams-clinton-for-embracing-policies-of-right-wing-war-hawks/ ).    I understand you disagree with her statements too, but making excuses for politicians - "everybody's doing it, she has to too" - is really a way of giving cover to odious policies.  And in a small way, contributes to such politicians being able to get away with it.  The "left" in this country spends far too much time negotiating itself out of its own beliefs under the misguided idea that electing conservatives under our own brand counts for something.   The truth is that Clinton is a hawkish globalist, and we ought to be call her out on it.      Sell! Sell!                     Agree, but, it's one thing to go with the flow, another to bang the drums.   This article seems to confirm Hightower's claims:   The jump in losses was largely due to a $1.5 billion increase in operating expenses as a result of workers compensation payments, the agency said.   USPS blames much of its financial troubles on a 2006 mandate to stow away billions of dollars for its future retirees' healthcare. The Postal Service already defaulted on three of its payments into the fund and does not expect to make the next $5.7 billion installment due September 30.             We're in violent agreement.   Full text - part 2  Most remarkable of all, Clinton tells Goldberg that, If I were the prime minister of Israel, youre damn right I would expect to have security [control over the West Bank]. What makes this statement so remarkable is that earlier in the interview, Hillary praised the Clinton parameters outlined by her husband in December 2000. Those parameters permit Israeli troops to remain in the Jordan Valley, along the West Banks border with Jordan, for three years. Later in the interview, Clinton claims that she convinced Abbas to agree to allow Israeli troops to remain for six, seven, eight years and that she got Netanyahu to go from forever to 2025 as a date for their withdrawal. Even this, from a Palestinian perspective, represents painful backsliding from the position outlined by Hillarys husband. But as Hillary must know, Bibi three weeks ago said that in light of regional developments, there cannot be a situation, under any agreement, in which we relinquish security control of the territory west of the River Jordan. Which is to say that, as of now, Bibis position really does seem to be forever. Yet rather than challenge that stance, Clinton endorses it.   Why does Clinton again and again endorse Netanyahus view of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict even when it contradicts long-standing American positions? Because shes so willing to see the world through his eyes. Notice how she begins her statement about security control of the West Bank: If I were the prime minister of Israel. Theres nothing wrong with that. U.S. officials should understand, and empathize with, Israeli leaders, even right-wing ones. But whats missing from Clintons interview is any willingness to do the same for Palestinians. If its so easy to understand why some Israelis might want perpetual military control of the West Bank, why cant Clinton understand why Palestinians - after living for almost fifty years under a foreign army - might not want it to indefinitely patrol their supposedly independent state.  One of the hallmarks of Barack Obamas statements about Israel and Palestine, going back to his 2008 presidential campaign, has been his insistence on giving voice to the fears and aspirations of both sides. Writing about his trip to Israel in The Audacity of Hope, Obama wrote that, I talked to Jews whod lost parents in the Holocaust and brothers in suicide bombings; I heard Palestinians talk of the indignities of checkpoints and reminisce about the land they had lost. In Jerusalem last March, he spoke movingly, and in detail about the Jewish story, but also asked Israelis to put yourself in their [the Palestinians] shoes. Look at the world through their eyes. In her interview with Goldberg, thats exactly what Clinton does not do. Her interpretations of recent Israeli-Palestinian history reflect from a deep imbalance: a willingness to see reality through Israeli eyes and an almost total refusal to do the same for Palestinians.  For far too long, wrote Aaron Miller in 2005, many American officials involved in Arab-Israeli peacemaking, myself included, have acted as Israel's attorney, catering and coordinating with the Israelis at the expense of successful peace negotiations. From the beginning, Barack Obama has tried to avoid that. Although he hasnt brokered Israeli-Palestinian peace, he has tried to make good on his campaign promise to hold up a mirror to both sides. In Hillary Clinton, by contrast, at least judging from her interview on Sunay, Israel has yet another lawyer. And a very good one at that.    Full text - part 1  Israels new lawyer: Hillary Clinton  Whos the Israeli governments best spokesperson? Ron Dermer? Michael Oren? Bibi himself? Nope. Its Hillary Clinton. In her interview on Sunday with Jeffrey Goldberg, Clinton offered the most articulate, sophisticated, passionate defense of Netanyahus conduct Ive heard from a government official on either side of the Atlantic. Unfortunately, important chunks of it arent true.  Lets take her claims in turn.  In his first term, Netanyahu moved towards a Palestinian state  Clinton began her defense of Bibi by noting that in his first term, in the late 1990s, he had give[n] up territory and moved in that direction [towards a Palestinian state], as hard as it was.  Thats extremely generous. Its true that in 1997, Bibi withdrew Israeli troops from most of the West Bank city of Hebron (though they can reenter any time Israel wants) and the following year signed the Wye River Accords, under which Israel was supposed to hand over 13 percent of the West Bank to the Palestinian Authority (though Bibis government fell before it could do so).   What Clinton leaves out is that Bibi only agreed to these withdrawals to forestall the far larger ones envisioned under the Oslo Accords he inherited from Yitzhak Rabin and Shimon Peres. In 1993, when Oslo was signed, Bibi publicly compared it to Neville Chamberlains surrender of the Sudetenland to Adolf Hitler.  He accepted Oslo in the 1996 election campaign only because he couldnt repudiate a process endorsed by the Israeli center and championed by the United States. So Bibi sabotaged Oslo by accelerating settlement growth and minimizing the amount of land Israel relinquished. Before I took office, he later boasted, the conception was to give away everything except for two percent [of West Bank] while I turned everything around and gave just two percent to [full control] of the Palestinian Authority. Or as he told settlers after leaving office, I stopped the Oslo Accords.    The Clinton administration officials who dealt with Bibi in his first term understood this all too well. Neither President Clinton nor Secretary [Madeleine] Albright believed that Bibi had any real interest in pursuing peace, writes Dennis Ross in The Missing Peace. Ross deputy, Aaron Miller, adds in his memoir that, all of us saw Bibi as a kind of speed bump that would have to be negotiated along the way until a new Israeli prime minister came along who was more serious about peace.  Thats a far cry from what Hillary told Goldberg. Then again, Ross and Miller arent running for president.  Bibi agreed to a settlement freeze but Abbas wouldnt negotiate  Fast-forwarding to the Obama years, Clinton claims that, I got Netanyahu to agree to the unprecedented settlement freeze It took me nine months to get Abbas into the negotiations even after we delivered on the settlement freeze.  Whats striking, again, is what Clinton leaves out. The settlement freeze was indeed, unprecedented. Unfortunately, it didnt actually freeze settlement growth. Its not just that, as Clinton admits, the freeze exempted East Jerusalem. Even more importantly, it exempted buildings on which construction had all ready begun. This loophole proved crucial because, as the Israeli press reported at the time, settlers spent the months preceding the freeze feverishly breaking ground on new construction, on which they continued to build during the ten month freeze, before breaking new ground once it expired. As a result, according to Peace Now, there was more new settlement construction in 2010 - the year of the freeze - than in 2008. As Obama administration envoy George Mitchell admitted to Palestinian negotiator Saab Erekat, the Obama administration had wanted a freeze that truly stopped settlement growth but we failed.  Clintons claim that Abbas refused to negotiate until the last minute is disingenuous too. In fact, Israeli and Palestinian negotiators met repeatedly during the freeze. In January 2010, just over a month after it began, veteran Israeli columnist Ben Caspit reported that, In the past weeks, Israeli representatives, including Netanyahu, have repeatedly rejected official documents that their Palestinian counterparts have tried to submit to them, with details of the Palestinian positions on all the core issues. The Israeli representatives are completely unwilling to discuss, read or touch these documents, not to speak of submitting an equivalent Israeli document with the Israeli positions.  While reporting my book, The Crisis of Zionism, I heard four different Obama officials confirm this account. During the settlement freeze, the Palestinians submitted to Netanyahu and his aides the same positions they had submitted to Netanyahus predecessor, Ehud Olmert. These included a Palestinian state on the 1967 lines with a 1.9 percent land swap for territory inside Israel proper, Israeli control of all the Jewish neighborhoods of East Jerusalem, international troops in the Jordan Valley and the return of 150,000 Palestinian refugees over ten years. The Netanyahu government, by contrast, steadfastly refused to discuss the parameters of a Palestinian state.  In her interview with Goldberg, Clinton never mentions that.  Netanyahus views on Palestinian statehood resembled Ehud Baraks.  Given the evidence that during her time as secretary of state, Bibi refused to discuss territory, Clintons claim that I saw Netanyahu move from being against the two-state solution toconsidering all kinds of Barak-like options is bizarre. Whatever you think of Ehud Baraks offer at Camp David in July 2000, it was a detailed offer. Netanyahu, by contrast, refused put forward a territorial proposal not merely during Clintons term, but during John Kerrys far more aggressive effort to broker a deal. During the Kerry negotiations, according to Haaretzs Barak Ravid, Netanyahu flatly refused to present a map or even to discuss the subject theoreticallythroughout the nine months of the talks Netanyahu did not give the slightest hint about the scale of the territorial concessions he would be willing to make.  Its too bad Goldberg didnt press Clinton on what kind of Barak-like options she heard Netanyahu propose, because the best reporting we have suggests he offered no territorial options at all.  Netanyahu is right to demand indefinite control of the West Bank            you're promoting division based on religion.  I think Israel beat us to that one.    Jews so special that they're the only nation on earth that isn't allowed to have their own country  The Jews aren't a nation.  They're a religious group.  When religions have their own country, well, we have a word for that.  Pakistan can call itself the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, but it's not recognized as such, rather only as the Republic of Pakistan.    Official religions and privileged classes are the perfect recipe for failure, such is the case, as we have seen, with Israel.   An Israeli Hasbara tactic - frightening your critics into silence.      TL;DR.  Without any irony, a Conservative accuses the left of not thinking.   Jim Hightower did a great commentary on this recently: http://www.jimhightower.com/node/8399       He's famous for writing ["What's the matter with Kansas?"](http://www.amazon.com/Whats-Matter-Kansas-Conservatives-America/dp/080507774X )            WTF - he was really in Irgun?      Elie Wiesel has lost all credibility.   Snowden and because he his admin has prosecuted more whistleblowers than all other Presidents combined (which I think is common knowledge, but could be wrong about that).   All the upvotes on this post are sardonic.   Thanks so much for the help!      The whites in South Africa worried about the same thing.            lol   The followers of bin Laden are smart enough to know that a military budget requires provisions for both offense and defense.  Funding for defense is in the end a line item on the plus side of the balance sheet, which leaves more room in the budget for weapons.    It really doesn't matter if you or I see it another way.  The enemies of Israel see us supporting them, and they hate us for it.  If the US were to give $225M for a Palestinian Iron dome too, it would be a different matter.    If an ancestors land ownership constitutes the right for a descendent to own it, then the Jews are the oldest group today that can trace itself back to ancient Israel.   1) Premise/Assumption: Original ownership of land passes to children/grandchildren/so-on.  The Palestinians are the Canaanites who predated the Jews.    Conclusion:  Palestinians have a claim to ownership of Palestine.   2) Premise/Assumption: Whoever currently controls a land is the owner.  If that were the case, there should have never been pressure to rid South Africa of its racist regime.    This premise isn't accepted.  Israel is a defacto Apartheid system, imposed only very recently, and the cause of great instability in the region.     3) Premise/Assumption: Controlling a land for 25/50/75/100/200/300/400/ years means that it becomes your land, until another group can hold that land for 25/50/75/100/200/300/400 years.  Again, see the answer to 2).  That is what we are here to discuss.  Land rights.  The Israelis obtained theirs by displacing the people who had lived there for centuries, which is the direct cause for the current problems in the region.       Why?   Truly idiotic.   They're only human shields if Israel won't fire on these areas - but Israel *is* willing to fire on these areas, so they're not human shields.  A better explanation is that Hamas militants are using the buildings as cover.  What we can conclude is that *both* Israel and Hamas don't care about civilian casualties.   Both historically and recently, they have the antecedent claim to the land.     from [Osama bin Laden's 'letter to America'](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2002/nov/24/theobserver )   (Q1) Why are we fighting and opposing you?    (1) Because you attacked us and continue to attack us.   a) You attacked us in Palestine:   (i) Palestine, which has sunk under military occupation for more than 80 years. The British handed over Palestine, with your help and your support, to the Jews, who have occupied it for more than 50 years; years overflowing with oppression, tyranny, crimes, killing, expulsion, destruction and devastation. The creation and continuation of Israel is one of the greatest crimes, and you are the leaders of its criminals. And of course there is no need to explain and prove the degree of American support for Israel. The creation of Israel is a crime which must be erased. Each and every person whose hands have become polluted in the contribution towards this crime must pay its*price, and pay for it heavily.   (Q2) What are we calling you to, and what do we want from you?   The American people are the ones who pay the taxes which fund the planes that bomb us in Afghanistan, the tanks that strike and destroy our homes in Palestine, the armies which occupy our lands in the Arabian Gulf, and the fleets which ensure the blockade of Iraq. These tax dollars are given to Israel for it to continue to attack us and penetrate our lands. So the American people are the ones who fund the attacks against us, and they are the ones who oversee the expenditure of these monies in the way they wish, through their elected candidates.      You realize that only a few decades ago, terrorist attacks against Americans were completely unthinkable.  That was before our interventionist foreign policy, and when we were seen as a neutral broker in the Middle East.  [We reap what we sow.](http://www.juancole.com/2005/08/fisking-war-on-terror-once-upon-time.html )   Blowback.   Asshole was willingly born not in a rich family.   That award has been so permanently discredited at this point.  Kissinger won it, for god's sake.     ... its almost as if they are cheap. Good thing there is no existing stereotype along these lines.  This is really terrible.  Let's have none of that here.   True on American taxpayers and Raytheon, but truth be told, *all* Palestinians are the losers, but the 87% of Israelis who support Netanyahu no doubt are quite pleased.   http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/2cnelj/obama_signs_bill_giving_israel_225_million_for/cjhcq3e   "U.S. Reps.

Remember the billions that we gave to the banks?  Or all that money that rich people already have?    The problem is that regular people don't have money.  Giving it straight to corporations is just going to make things worse.     That is really depressing.  If she sincerely believes in it, that's almost enough to make me write her off.  I hope this is just a political calculation.  I think it would be impossible for a Presidential candidate to vote against something like this and have any chance in this climate.  So for now, I'm going to assume this is a matter of picking battles.   And it creates terrorists for free!                     The presence of Israel on the holy sites is one of the prime recruiting reasons for radical Islamists.    The bigger problem is that the US wants control of the region.  Israel is out proxy there.  And that's the reason OP's post will only be a wild pipe dream - that is, until regional oil supplies are no longer important.      That's why the blockade has been condemned by the UN and several human rights organizations.  But, in the Orwellian world of the hasbara activist, the Israeli imposed Palestinian "diet" is a great, generous humanitarian act.    Good grief.   The check for your hasbara services is in the mail.   I have no idea what any of this is about.         Hamass can stop hiding among and behind women and children any time they want, but they do not.   Hamas has been accused of using human shields, but this only works if the opponent cares about civilian casualties.  Obviously, Israel does not.     Hamas bears much of the blame for this violence. They have been preparing for it for some time given the complexity of tunnel networks.  Is see, some of the individuals of the open air prison have rebelled.  Since we've already accepted that collective punishment is an acceptable approach, might as well kill prisoners arbitrarily, right, whether they were involved or not.  Hopefully they will learn to cower before their masters,  the thieves who stole their ancestral properties, once enough of their children are dead.      They were elected to lead, and instead of building schools, infrastructure, and bettering the lives of civilians; they build missiles, bombs, suicide vests, and tunnels.  LOL.  Let's ignore the fact that the Israeli government blocked supplies to the open air prison after Hamas won the vote, right?  Or as that senior Israeli official described it:  "**[The idea is to put the Palestinians on a diet, but not to make them die of hunger.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dov_Weissglass )**"  Fucking evil genocidal sacks of shit.  But the world is starting to learn the truth, despite the best efforts at selective story-telling by the hasbara brigade.  Israel is being seen for what it is - the Nazi's Frankenstein monster - and world public opinion is repudiating it.     Responding by killing over a thousand Palestinians = "getting a pass".  Spoken like a true supporter of Israel.   For Israel, everything is permitted.  Move along.   pitt-visla?

See my response here: http://www.reddit.com/r/bestof/comments/2cc4ch/redditor_explains_why_canada_not_isreal_should_be/cje270y     The Shah of Iran hates us for our actions in 1953, nothing to do with Israel.   The Shah of Iran, Reza Pahlavi, was a close ally of the United States.  His secret police, SAVAK, were notorious for disappearing and torturing his opponents.  [Saddam was a US ally, as was Osama bin Laden.](http://www.juancole.com/2005/08/fisking-war-on-terror-once-upon-time.html )  The point is that our support for Israel is just one aspect of our  meddling in the Middle East.  It has produced negative consequences for us.  At one time, it was unthinkable that the US would be the target of terrorist attacks.  It was seen as a fair and unbiased actor in the region.  However, after years of self-interested intervention, as the CIA warned, we're experiencing blowback.  **EDIT** grammar   Our support over the years of Israel and other brutal regimes in the region - Shah of Iran, Saddam, the Saudi dictatorship - is the #1 reason cited by leaders of anti-US groups like Al Qaeda for their actions against us.   I think you're vastly underestimating the cost of our support for Israel.   As a Canadian, I second the sentiment.   At best he gets fired.  The DOJ is too busy prosecuting music downloaders and weed smokers.  Move along.      Come on, guys, it's not really her fault - Israel hasn't had time to brief her on what she's supposed to say yet.     PB; DR.                      The US doesn't do business that way and we try to put in power a democratic government.  That is the story that American propagandists would like to tell, but that is not the view of everyone.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1953_Iranian_coup_d'tat  http://www.juancole.com/2005/08/fisking-war-on-terror-once-upon-time.html    We also did a "regime change" in Serbia/Kosovo, and there's not "brutal chaos" there.  That is a valid argument.   It's no small coincidence that the US is more active in more volatile parts of the world and that volatile parts of the world are more likely to descend into chaos.  1. But if the US tends not to be successful in interventions, we should tend not waste blood and treasure by intervening. 2. In some of the cases (e.g., Iraq), the regions are unstable because of previous US interference (i.e., CIA/Mossadegh).   No.   Try living in Boston.  Corner of Tremont and Tremont, anyone?  How many Washington Streets in Boston, exactly?   In the suburb Newton alone there are 22 duplicate street names.   And of course, about 1/4 of the signs are missing anyway.  Having lived through the hell of Boston, I was surprised to see SF does come up 3rd in this list of [America's most challenging cities to navigate?](http://www.bestplaces.net/docs/studies/navcities.aspx).    How about just stop meddling?    So did Syria and Ukraine, and the US didn't do anything substantive there.  logical fallacy  **EDIT** For all the down voters - do you understand what a [logical fallacy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_fallacy ) is?  This argument has the structure:  1. ALL P ARE Q  2. Q  3. THEREFORE Q MUST BE A P  4. BUT Q IS NOT A P, THEREFORE (1) IS FALSE  I.e.,  an invalid argument - a classical logical fallacy.  Translating, Sleekery is arguing:  1. All countries which the US regime changed (P) are countries which descended into chaos (Q)  2. Syria descended into chaos  3. Therefore Syria must be a country which the US invaded  4. But Syria wasn't invaded by the US, therefore (1) must be false...  An invalid argument.                  Saudi Arabia, Israel, Egypt - top US foreign aid recipients.                       I don't believe that the entire Progressive caucus supports this, rather I read this as abject cowardice. AIPAC has a stranglehold over our politics, and even the most stalwart progressives can't say a peep about it.    But, I think it's unfair to single out one politician - just imagine being the *only one* of all your colleagues to criticize Israel.  That is guaranteed to come back and bit you.    Settler: "Yes, but this roof is mine.  It is all mine.  The whole country is mine.  My State."  Homeowner: "This is not.  This is my roof.  Why are you entering my roof?"  Settler: "You just think it is yours.  But this whole country is the Land of Israel."  Homeowner: "No, this is Hebron, not Israel. It is Palestine here. I am not in Tel Aviv."  Settler: "What is Palestine? Only the Romans called it Palestine.  This is the land of Israel.  This is the land of Israel.  It is my country.  And everything in the country is mine.  Not just mine, also of the members of my religion."       I try to avoid Italian places for this reason.  There's too much wheat floating around in those kitchens.   Sullivan considers himself a conservative, but he's often been quite critical of the Republican party.  And he's been an unabashed Obama supporter.  [In fact, googling, I found this whiney piece from the National Review discussing the Obama team texting him during the debates.](http://www.nationalreview.com/media-blog/363069/team-obama-was-texting-andrew-sullivan-during-first-2012-debate-greg-pollowitz  ) E.g., http://dish.andrewsullivan.com/2014/03/10/the-best-of-the-dish-today-140/  http://www.newsweek.com/andrew-sullivan-how-obamas-long-game-will-outsmart-his-critics-64177  http://dish.andrewsullivan.com/2014/06/24/raging-against-obama-and-history/    No, I agree that is pretty clearly biased.   Yet, a lot of this article rung true to me.  I think Clinton, if elected President, will be a disaster for progressives.  I've heard nothing out of her mouth that I believe.  Even when she talked about income inequality recently at the Aspen Ideas conference, it sounded like she was bullshitting.  She so carefully couched her words that it seemed like a nod and a wink to her fellow globalists: "just what the proles want to hear, don't you know".  That has been my impression, anyway.     What do you disagree with? (I'm not a right wing troll, if that's what you're thinking - quite the opposite).      That is awesome, thank you.  I'll never buy another thing from them.      It doesn't say anything about 729 in that link.      Germany should have had a piece carved off after WWII.  That would have been just.     729 means Israel?               True. Egypt, Israel and Saudi Arabia.               Greenwald makes the point that he's not incompetent, but is actually competently achieving his goals. They are just different from what progressives want to believe.  * http://www.salon.com/2011/08/01/debt_ceiling/  * http://www.salon.com/2010/06/21/obama_137/                   "Spitzer".    Hobby Lobby did not object to covering typical "birth control," and, if I'm reading this decision correctly, is not exempt from covering combined oral contraceptives (i.e., the medication that nigh everyone thinks of when you say "birth control").   To that end, I'm sorry to say, I think Sen. Warren is being disingenuous, as is any reporter/opinion writer that implies that this case applies to a broader scope than written.  You are wrong:  [the SCOTUS clarified *the very next day* that the decision applies broadly to the entire contraceptive mandate, not just the handful of methods that Hobby Lobby objected to](http://talkingpointsmemo.com/news/scotus-says-hobby-lobby-ruling-applies-broadly ).    Even without this, why would you think Warren is being disingenuous when she is merely echoing the ideas in Ginsburg's dissent?  We should be thankful for her voice on this issue.    The privately traded company Hobby Lobby is wholly owned by devoutly religious peoples, and therefore should have access to the same exemptions as other religious employers.  Under this theory, companies owned by religious people are indistinguishable from religious institutions, so shouldn't have to pay any tax at all.  But that is obviously false.  Religious institutions and charities are categorically different from corporate employers, which is why we treat them as such everywhere in US law.   HSS did not open the door to anything.           What exactly are you remembering?  Obama was an extremely lackluster Senator. [An assessment by 7 liberal interest groups ranked him as among the least liberal"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate_career_of_Barack_Obama#Legislation_and_voting_record ).  Warren is already a huge force in the Senate - so much so that some progressives mistakenly argue that "we need her to continue doing what she's doing in the Senate".  Not so for Obama, that's for sure -- what exactly did he do?    I remember quite well because a very close friend of mine was an ardent supporter of his.  At that time, I was following Obama's record quite closely.  And another friend, an African-American lawyer who was at Harvard Law a few years after Obama,  also followed his career closely.  There was *very* little in the way of actual legislative achievements to indicate his governing style.  The one thing of note was that Obama would do a good job of explaining each side's arguments - at Harvard Law school and in Illinois - and that was his great strength, expressing the interests of both sides of the argument.  His whole life has been about playing the middle.  If you think he was some great success in the Senate, you ought to supply some data.      Right - it has nothing to do with Eric Holder putting [this asshole](http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2013/03/29/lanny-breuer-and-the-immorality-of-our-morality.html) in charge of bank fraud:   Breuer expressed his prosecutorial philosophy thus: "In reaching every charging decision, we must take into account the effect of an indictment on innocent employees and shareholders," Breuer said. "Those are the kinds of considerations in white-collar crime cases that literally keep me up at night and which must play a role in responsible enforcement."  ... before he left for a $4M a year job working for banks.    The problem is people weren't paying attention: telecom immunity, supporting Joe Lieberman over Ned Lamont, "Reagan is the model president", and "American needs bipartisanship" - were all pretty clear signals about what kind of President Obama was going to be.  Warren has been spent her whole career actually  fighting for the issues she's stumping about.  Not so Obama.   Who is Eliot?   What's annoying is that people aren't paying attention to the details.  Obama's message was that bipartisanship was the answer, and Reagan was the president he'd emulate.  Warren has been writing and testifying about income inequality from before she got into politics.   Obama has governed very conservatively, and there was every indication he was going to do that in the primaries.  Not so for Warren.    You're 100% right, Warren does not have an outstanding voting record (just like Obama).  This is totally wrong.   Obama had no track record of doing anything progressive.  His core message was about bipartisanship ("one America, not two", remember?) - this is why I was never a fan of his.  He showed he was a conservative during the primaries -- he supported telecom immunity; supported Joe Lieberman over the excellent progressive, Ned Lamont; praised Reagan as a model president; there were several actions like this that showed he would govern as a conservative.  He even stated that his supporters ascribed their own politics to him, though he was more conservative than they thought.  But... you have to pay attention to the details.  If you don't, you're likely to reach the conclusion that "everything is the same".  But it's not - what did Obama actually achieve before he was elected?  Nothing.  What did he actually fight for?  Nothing - he gave a pretty speech at the convention about the need for bipartisanship.  It was clear what we were electing.   We ended up coding Twitter/FB shares using just the libraries provided by them/iOS Apis    I spent so much time trying to get ShareKit to work - it's really a huge disaster.  The approach seems to be super-aggressive on releasing auth credentials.  What this means is, if you rely on Facebook auth as a means for being logged in to your own app, simply by doing a ShareKit share, the user can be logged out of your own app    I tried pointing this out to the maintainers, and issued patches, but they didn't accept them.  There are several other problems.  Even though it seems to have a lot of integrations, it's really not worth the trouble, in my experience.     [Ginsburg talks about exactly this issue in her dissent.] (http://www.newsday.com/opinion/columnists/anne-michaud/the-murky-hobby-lobby-decision-anne-michaud-1.8823229) Hobby Lobby is refusing to pay for IUDs, which can cost a month's wages.  Ginsburg argues that the employers are effectively *preventing* any use of that form of birth control for their employees.    If members of SCOTUS are saying this, I think Warren is on pretty solid ground.  On another note, it seems that progressives have been fighting losing battles when they second guess themselves and pull their punches.  I'd say that the complaints you have against her are exactly the reason she's ought to lead the party --- she puts the progressive argument on an offensive stance.  (And she's right).  That's how we're going to win battles going forward, not hedging and qualifying things as though we're in philosophy class.   There's more than just this Supreme Court ruling: shutting down of clinics, forced vaginal ultrasound, etc.  It's not a stretch to describe what the Rs have been doing as an all out assault.

 Nope. Not an oak anyway. Grafting only works between closely related groups. Usually the "family" designation is the bounary. If you look at the website you provide, you'll see that the fruits group together by how they are related.   Find one. Just one.   Of course, we can now isolate genes so they don't spread in the pollen (by inserting into the chloroplast genome). No one yet has because the cost of deregulating a single transgenic event is about $100 million. So, due to unscientific review processes, we're all stuck with the old technology because the incremental increase in prfit doesn't offset the investment. It's also the same reason you don't see start-ups breaking into this market.   That's actually not true. Yes, genes can move through pollen, but Monsanto has never actually brought suit to farmers with accidental gene trasmission. Most people are familiar with [this suit](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monsanto_Canada_Inc._v._Schmeiser) but remember it as Monsanto crushing some farmer. In reality, the defendant violated Canadian patent law by intentionally growing the protected seeds.  I challenge anyone to find a case where Monsanto actually sued a farmer for accidental contamination. And don't just find some crappy blog. Find court documents supporting your position.      I'll be honest, the ID was just based on growth habit on a norway maple. It's a relatively new disease in the United States. Somewhere, there exists some dichotomous keys. They usually rely on the shape of appendages on the chasmothecia and the number of asci and spores. You'd have to google around.  If you find scenescent leaves infect with mildew you may find the small black stuctures. I did a wet mount with those. Then with the end of a pen or probe, you can press on the cover slip until it cracks. You can usualy hear it crack. As water moves in the asci swell and poke out.  It's fun.

Keep an eye on the website for when those are. It's also somewhat unwise to set a run before you've done a few. Sorry dude.   Respiration of 1 gram of fat (plus O2) gives about 1.1 grams of water (plus CO2).   Well, the core started hot from the materials condensing into a planet and rock insulates pretty well but that's only part of it.  Radioactive decay is the rest. This continually releases energy within the earth, keeping it hot. On the upshot, this is also where the helium comes from.  Yes, it can eventually run out and solidfy. This is what happened to Mars. Mars, being a little smaller, has a greater surface area to volume than the Earth and cooled faster.   First: Not a race, you racist.  J/k, Taking a guess based on the hares (the people setting the trail) and that fact that it's March Madness, it is probably a start of a Saturday. However, there is a strong chance of drinking at bars until 2. That happens kind of a lot. Some hashes are all night or even all weekend affairs.   Well??

Just have a sense of humor and don't wear nice clothes (it's not always on roads). I am trying to get over my hangover from yesterday's run. There was something with apple cider and everclear. I have a headache. It was a good time.   Cool story bro.   It's called ice. You can't drink ice, but once pretreated properly it becomes ingestable.   The first and formost reason is speed. If it takes about 5 years to go from seed to a fruiting tree then during the career of a plant breeder they may only be able to do 6 or 8 generations, at best. As compared to something like beets or beans, where you might get 2 generations a year, progress is slow.  The second reason is mangos act a bit like apples. Apples do not "come true to seed" and neither do mangos. Each tree that comes from one seed has a huge degree of variability which makes it hard to breed for any particular trait. Any worthwhile apple tree that, partly by luck,  happens to have good qualities is propagated by grafting (a form of cloning). The same is true for good quality mango trees.  Third is economic. It's sad, but the rich countries either haven't cared about mangos or don't grow mangos, or both. This is true for a lot of crops and as government funding asymtotically approaches zero, most crop breeding is focused around crops companies can make a living selling.  Fourth, is that no one likes GMOs. Making a safe, seedless mango is close to trivial using modern techniques. It could be made in the same way the seedless grapes, watermelons, and bananas have been made all of which are clearly safe. But! No one likes a GMO, so we're stuck with seeded Mangos and a whole pile of other foods that might be made better. My wish is tearless onions, but hey, not 'til education is fixed.        That's usually only a temporary condition.   And if you like a ton of beer while you're running, try the [Hash House harriers](http://www.madisonh3.com). Also, some nudity.          	25

Oh my god I just came    The dick?   Retired.   Breaking Bad taught me that quality is always more important than quantity.   If they look like the Chevy SSR who the Fuck who want a remade older car. That thing is hideous    Yeah we also sniff each other's asses when we greet one another.   Neighbors   Doesn't look abandoned?   Breaking Bad   Family photo! Cute!   By the looks of it the two on far left are single too.   The fuq is he feeding that beast?   Eggception   Boss I can't make it in I'm sober and impaired!! Well Billy actually you're just retarded    This seems safe. Good thing the guy has some rhythm.   Damn that's rough. How did she survive by drinking her own blood?   Hi Nick! Its me your secretive Santa. Well I think you know who I am by now. I saw you staring out the window and figured you saw me this morning! Oh well but have you received your gift?! I'm sure you'll love it! Haven't seen you much lately so figured you've been busy at work.   At first glance at the pic I thought it was a snowman with a dick and balls _   After sex you would basically just push me off of you or get up and leave the room or something  Holy shit this had me dying    I can't tie my shoes but I can fuck your bitch!   I'll come across the pond love and take you to a nice steak dinner    He's about to swallow Mr Hoot owl in two bites    I've got a gsp/lab mix. She's super sweet and intelligent but really high strung. She can be very destructive if you don't give her exercise and attention. Luckily my wife rescued a kitten and they've been bff's for a couple months now. My cat just trolls on her   Or maybe OP is really hot with a killer bod and he wants to fuck the taboo   LATER BITCHHHhhhh   Curb stomp that motherfucker! Then your dog can eat it's remains :)   This is relevant but me and my wife saw "Into the Woods" last night. I was blown away by the sexual undertones and general themes for a 'kids movie'. There's a scene in the woods with Emily Blunt and Chris Pine where they hardcore makeout (when Blunts married with a newborn child) and carry on for 5 minutes with song about how it doesn't matter what happens since they're in the woods.   There was death and disfigurement throughout as well. Maybe its just me but it did seem a bit much for a children's movie. Just my two cents.   The black one comes over and has a cute pair of slippers on like oh hai I'm here tew   Because all I can think of is that dumbass State Farm commercial with the talking baby and the mine    The souls of a thousand corpses.   Its Toucan Sam's used condom.   What a fucking idiot that "cop" is. He had no reasonable suspicion to search her for drugs in a fucking divorce hearing. And the other fat fuck can fuck off too for being the one to arrest her. False allegations against a police officer? Stupid fuck doesn't even know what laws he's supposed to enforce. And finally a big fuck you to the judge. Hope you're barred from ever practicing law again.   It's the necrophilia sex doll!    My friend Shannon told me that he had discovered a super easy way to make money.  I thought it was a guy the whole time.   Also, out of curiosity, how much money you make Rhonda?   Why didn't he just kill you right there?  Rhonda please don't scream you know I can't take the screams    iiiiii caught ya! Youuuuu can't run from me!   Fuck   Damn, was Margaret Hamilton a transsexual?    Bottom left makes him look like a knight. Top right looks like a catchers mask.   That's hilarious you're just crying when Bugs comes back on and your parents walk in like da fuq   What the fuck?   Nice username :)    "Rim cum compilation"   Fuck whoops haha    Just watched it on Xbox video. Definitely some laugh out loud parts. Franco made this movie, imo.    I bet it took at least 15 minutes to do that    The movie guy seeing if he was liking his movie!      Do you think criminals read shit like that?!  These are the kind of people that should spend the rest of their life rotting in a cell. Stop giving long sentences and incarcerating non-violent offenders for petty crimes.   Babe! It looks great!    [Reminds me of this scene](http://youtu.be/aEMQDIzZzFw)   Wow the fuq   That's fucked up but I'm still smiling. Gotta love reddit.   Sussana Reid can beat me off anytime    Back when halo 2 was in its prime my friend made it a point to create the most vulgar gamertags he could. Xbox Live kept letting him change it for free and never actually banned him. I think one was CumOnMySweetAss and then he changed it to xFxIxNxGxExRxMxEx. Good times.

If a government institution (and it's constituents) is deciding whether or not a mother can choose to give birth to her own flesh and blood, then it can expand welfare to all the women and children suffering due to the force behind such a choice.   Monty Squared?   I believe what she is referring to is the people who are "pro-life" and "anti-welfare"... it seems, IMO, that the people forcing women to have a baby that they cannot mentally, physically, or financially take care of are the ones that are unwilling to provide for them once they have sacrificed a career, a life, or an education to raise the baby.   I'm pro-choice because I've never been a fourteen-year-old incest victim pregnant by her father, or a woman who's going to die if the pregnancy continues, or a rape victim, or even a teenager who made a mistake. I want women to have choices, but I also believe that it's a life, especially once it's big enough to live outside the womb.  EDIT: I'm a man.   That... is... bad... ass!

Look who is talking, Ole Miss.  Y'all seem to be no more than two years removed from a .500 season.    And JUST because a team is P5 doesn't mean they have fans.  Try to get Wake Forest, Boston College, Illinois etc. fans to their own stadium, much less an opponents.    What I am saying is dividing current P5/G5 teams as of now is lazy way to do it.

 Don't give up.  Investing/trading/gambling is as much about learning how to lose money as it is learning how to make money.  The key is to not let the feat get to you and instead to continue educating yourself to make better entry/exit decisions next time.     Learn what these terms mean: 1) stop limit order 2) short squeeze  you bought into naked long equity positions in $TSLA and $TWTR right as they hit the peak of a short squeeze.  If you had at least put in standing stop limit orders, you could have limited your loss.  When you enter a position, you can put in a standing One-Cancels-All order, in which you can post both stop limit order (in case of loss), and a limit order (for capping gain).  If one gets executed, the other is cancelled.  This way for each position you enter, you have defined exits in both directions.  Might be a good start so that you feel more in control of your investment.  Buy low, sell high.  and learn to be patient.   I'm a Krugman fan generally (or rather I believe Keynesian economics, when dealing with centralized government), but disagree with him here completely.    However, now after a few days of thinking about it, I wonder if this is a bit of a feign for him.  He hasn't really mounted anything of an intelligent teardown of Bitcoin, and now he's just pulling in other friends almost as if to shield himself.  If you think about where he is professionally, it makes a lot of sense that he can't really support Bitcoin or weigh in positively until it really becomes more accepted.  He's an economist, not an entrepreneur.  But then again, what he said about the internet...   I traded some ARIA last week.  Was going to try and ride it from 7 to 8 but volume really died off Thursdsay/Friday so I got out at +$0.18/share.  I'd watch it this next week...not sure what to expect with New Years but I'm guessing we'll have more tax sell off Mon-Tues.  Might want to wait til Thurs/Fri or week after to dive in.  Look for increased volume and whether it can break $7.40.  I still think this stock could get to $10 in the next 2 months.  It traded around $20 pre-FDA decision, and now with the amended guidelines I've heard their target market is half of what it was.  So $10 seems like something it could reach, but I've only been following it for a couple of weeks.   thanks man...just found out about /r/house this past month     	5
 About 8 years ago we used to have a commercial for a car place whose tag line was "If the tranny is dead, just call Fred." I always used to think it sounded like it should be a slogan for a really shady law firm, a la Saul Goodman.   I felt so cool back in the 5th or 6th grade when I broke into my friend's lego club account by answering his security question. Back when everyone had Harry Potter as what's your favorite book?   A significant portion of Indiana actually hates Notre Dame.   I've never seen a bad puppet episode.   1 tequila, 2 tequila, 3 quetila, floor.  FTFY   There's a lot of drinks where you won't taste the alcohol after the 4th or 5th one.   She did in the wishverse. And the comics.   Pigfarts Pigfarts, here I come. Pigfarts Pigfarts, yum yum yum.   Back when I was still in Civil Engineering, every other major had all these guys complaining about how there were no girls. We were at about 50/50. Apparently girls only become civil engineers.   And the Aarons have the most Home Run by brothers even though Tommie only had 13. In fairness they still manage to beat all 3 DiMaggio brothers though.   Super Saiyan Dwight.   And in fairness on the decommitting from Indiana thing, it was because he didn't like they way they treated his brother.   The last 5 minutes of Cheers was absolutely incredible.   What if I told you that being it wasn't all it's cracked up to be? A Children's Game: Part of ESPN's 30 for 30.   Your goodwill sells DVDs? Mine still only has VHS.   Yeah I should have clarified. That movie didn't portray what happened with Rudy well at all. But Indiana as a place was portrayed fairly accurately. Devine never would have stood for the whole giving up jerseys thing, and the players never would have thought to do it either. And the chanting was mostly joking/sarcastic.   My senior year of high school we had to take a fairy tale and rewrite it as film noir. We chose little bunny foo foo. The Good Fairy was a mob boss.   Alpha as fuck.   THE Ohio State.   A friend of mine apparently broke up with his girlfriend as an April Fools Joke. I'm still waiting to see how that went over.   A lot of the state is, honestly. I've spent some pretty boring days in random small towns because we didn't want to drive home between basketball games in the playoffs. Because it's always the random small towns that have gyms that hold 10,000 people.   I've always liked Deshaun Thomas. Disappointed his team didn't make it far enough his senior year of high school for him to end up the all time leading scorer in Indiana history.   Hulls is at least 5'11", and might be up to 6'. I've never stood back to back with him, but he always seemed pretty close in height with me.   Yeah the biggest inaccuracy I can think of are that the buildings in Rudy that are supposed to be Holy Cross are actually at Notre Dame. That and I'm not sure there's ever been a South Bend shovel slayer. Hoosiers was pretty much spot on, Breaking Away, too.   I thought LA was already Lob City though.   Land Before Time got run so far into the ground it made it all the way to China.   Better dead than orangered.   Those orangered bastards.   Look at how nice I am while I'm calling you a dumbo bimbo bitch.   Guys, what's the fourth?   We'll end up finishing somewhere in the upper middle of the ACC. This will give us a seed somewhere between 5 and 10. We'll then proceed to lose our first game in the tournament.   A good Easter for Notre Dame.   Isn't it always?   I agree. Just because someone with a suit can pull off a fedora, doesn't mean they looked better with them on. Even then, they were for function. It was just the acceptable hat to wear with a suit.   He definitely halved the value of the car if he's lucky.   For a second I thought the blue pie was drinking, but I see now your priorities were indeed correct.   He didn't own the Bobcats when this came out.   The Pope doesn't even have the power to execute priests. And if they did that'd be an even bigger set of issues I would think.   They're just downvoting.   81x7.   Yeah they decided to go as people in the Justice League. Local news never caught on.   [What this meme should be.](http://qkme.me/3tlsnc)   Unfortunately only about half, though.   This whole time I was under the impression that atheists were smarter and superior to the rest of us.   Some guys in my dorm did [this](http://www.abc57.com/video/Avengers-assemble-Summer-movie-season-kicks-off-150154375.html) last year.   It's there now.   Shit how many people do we send to USC? I thought it was weird even having the 1 from my grade, and I'm guessing you're not the same person.   The may be senile old men, but they're our senile old men.   I bet he's a such a "nice guy" though. It's not fair that no one wants to be with him.   If this is how he acts, I doubt he was having a lot of sex in high school.   The Dobler-Dahmer effect.   Isn't that basically multiple personality disorder?   While I was in high school our team had 2 losses to Oden and Conley, one to Gordon, and one to Hayward. I believe we also had 4 wins over the Teagues. Never got to play the Zellers.    Yeah Sampson got a few guys likes Gordon, but a huge issue was that for most part his guys weren't serious about basketball. He was essentially running a program like Blue Mountain State. The only guys who weren't getting stoned and drunk all the time his last year were Gordon and White, which is part of the reason neither came back. And why a lot of the guys in state weren't considering it.  Side note, posts like these just remind me of how much talent the state produces. I think half my high school's losses while I was there were to nba lottery picks.   I still wonder how different things would be if the whole O'Leary lying thing hadn't happened and we managed to hire him.   Hulls wasn't even going to consider IU when Sampson was there. And he hasn't known anything but IU for pretty much his whole life.   At least they still have Bob Davie.   In fairness, Wooden went to Purdue. That said I have nothing but respect for UCLA and our mutual hatred of USC.   I'm not sure there was ever an age where it was acceptable to wear rip off pants to a dance. Or anywhere besides athletics.   I see what you're doing here Chevy. /r/HailCorporate No more of your clever advertising.   I don't know that I remember a time where my bedtime was that early.   I had a friend with long blonde hair. When he went to bars guys would come up to him and ask if they could buy him a drink. He would just turn around and say sure.   I love the kid having the phone conversation in the background.   Yeah this definitely made the aim buddy info rounds. Because what 13 year old doesn't think this is hilarious?   Maybe she was just orgasming over his incredible guitar playing.   Leave your door open. That's how you meet people.   I say it because my 4th grade teacher drilled it into our heads.   /r/stopgirl So simple. So great.   Still only allowed if you don't get her off before you finish. Source: Catholic school.   The fact that he had crushes on that many girls clearly means he didn't date much in high school. As does him deciding this was a good idea.   As long as he was making shit up, I half expected him to get invited back for a threesome.   M'LADY   The Monstars.   I hope this account comes back in 9 months.   I plan to start saying this now.   I bet he skipped leg day.   Hell I actually confronted one. We'd dated for a month or so earlier then gone back to being friends. Then she started acting like she had feelings for me again a few months later. Finally after about a month of that I confronted her about it and called her out on it. We ended up dating for a few years after that.   I believe they returned 2.2 ppg his first year. 1.8 from Taber and 0.4 from some other walk on.   I'm just jealous that those are the lows. I'd take them as the highs.   I always like to ask people who talk about Lynyrd Skynyrd to name 3 songs by them. A lot of them can't.   When I used to work at KMart we had someone try to return an open box of condoms. He was told we couldn't give him his money for an opened box. His response: "How else was I supposed to know if they fit if I didn't try one on?" He got his money back right away so that he would go away.   I choose to believe somewhere out there there's people who like those bizarre sex moves.   Thug means never having to say you're sorry.   Except it would flood the market. you have to ration them out. Like diamonds.   This is also before UCLA was the UCLA it is now. Minnesota is much closer to the Minnesota of the 40s, without the benefit of a strong football team.   Also Puff lives by the sea. I'm not sure he'd want to leave that weather for Minnesota. For Santa it's practically tropical though.   Good job getting Tyrone to dress up like Luigi.   Or you can text them then offer $100 when they say they're waiting until marriage.   And yet he's still half hover handing.   They are always right.   Mine has Duke over Miami in the finals, with Arizona and Florida in my final four. The coin knows all apparently.   Well it's not like Luke had good options for leaving.   We don't even own that, we sold it to some Europeans.   I don't have class for about 9 hours.   Sociopath Steve?   Ask some females what they think of fedoras.   Hey now, don't forget the short sleeve button ups with flames.   Well not necessarily that good. I more just meant guys who weren't talented enough in high school but had the grades but went juco to try to get into a better program. I'm ok with taking jucos who went that route because of talent, just not grades.   I have those scissors!   DAE remember 2005? Only real 90s kids get this.  	100
 No fucking SHIT!?   Lance it with a needle, let's see what comes out. I'm curios    I bacon your pardon, but what the shit is this?   My Dad is not a cell PHONE!   Sweet Mother Teresa on the hood of a Mercedes Benz     Well, the more you know  	6

Also, now that you mention it looking back the whole mood and background of the show got increasingly more colorful as the show progressed.    I'll just share my quick interpretation quick I guess.   Houtarou mentions throughout the entire series the rose colored high school life and through the whole series he grows into this role. Do you think that final scene with the cherry blossoms and shit was foreshadowed by all of that or a finalization of his transformation?   All in all it was fucking great except for the confusing end. Thanks based batcrains for suggestion    My dad got his nipples pierced at Rock Fest in 2009 or so. Still has em' pierced.

You probably meant something along the lines of "Airsofting makes you sweat, and you will sweat hard."   What you said is just repeating the same thing twice with more or less the same sentiment.

I'm just going to type it how it's written in my little manifesto of mine.  Back in 2009, or 2008? I can't remember the year but it was awhile ago. I'm 17 and it happened when I was 11 for reference. When I was younger I took a grand trip to Canada, Alaska, and Seattle with my grandparents and my cousin. The cruise started from port in West Seattle (like by the Space Needle-ish and the cool stuff.)   When we arrived in Seattle we decided to stay at a hotel for three days to visit the Dry Soda Company (I saw it on Food Network and was curious) the Space Needle, and, regretfully, the famous Pikes Place Market. Well, not regretfully as in going there was bad, but the market is a dark place in my mind because of my experience.   We explored the lights and sounds, and shopped the first day. That was amazing. Seattle was, and is, a beautiful city with beautiful sights. Well, the "supreme travel itinerary" as my grandma dubbed it, was that we'd go to the Pikes Place market on the second day. Now, I don't know how it looks now, but when I visited there were a lot of homeless people. My grandparents told me not to pay any mind to them and to ignore them. This made me sad. A blemish of sorts, but it didn't deter me from the whole face of Seattle.  I remember that whole morning as vivid as yesterday. I woke up, ignored the not-so-inviting continental breakfast and waited for my grandparents to finish. Hell, I even remember playing Yoshi's Island DS on my DS Lite. Well, they were always cheap.  They finished up and we were off. As soon as we left the entrance we were greeted by a young women. She was obviously homeless by the tattered clothes and McDonalds cup with loose change in it. She smelled like pot and paint thinner. She looked hungry and distraught. Her haggard frame didn't take away from her still young looking face. She seemed to be in her late 20's or early 30's from what I recall.  Anyways, I remember reaching for my pokemon themed wallet with the intent to give her change. As I went to rummage for a penny or two my grandpa scolded me and snatched the wallet from my hands. "No test_subject8195" he said, "There's a reason she's like that."  "There's a reason she's like that."  That stuck with me. It still sticks with me. Here was this human being reduced to the status of a stray dog, and he said that. I remember sighing, still shocked at his demeanor, and trailing behind them. I remember seeing a young gentlemen, probably a concierge or a bag boy, chase her off. "Oh well." I remember thinking.   Fast forward through a sea of cardboard pleas, winos, and street performers and we reached our destination. Pikes Place Market. I remember splitting off from my grandparents and cousin while watching a young gentlemen toss a fish around and do other tricks. After he was finished I clapped, and turned around.   Gone. My grandparents were nowhere to be found and I was caught in a sea of fish smell, patrons, and the sinking feeling that I was inevitably fucked. I scrambled through the crowd to no avail. The thick smog of bodies clouded my view, and my calls for help went unanswered. After breaking through the crowd I found a back alley. Scared, confused, and hoping for a break from the hustle and bustle I walked through the alley.   Torn flyers, waste bins, and other arrangements of junk littered the passage. Then I heard it. The sound that haunts my dreams and my mind when it wanders.  Gurgling. A low mumbling gurgle laced with coughs and the unmistakable sound of struggling. It sounded rather odd, but my adventurous 11 year old brain led me to the source. Oh how I wish it didn't. How I wish I would have just sauntered off or turned around.  I walked over to a tipped over trashcan, and a dumpster. I didn't know what to expect, but it wasn't like the movies. It wasn't slow, but it was silent. Save for the god awful gurgling and struggling. I even remember the picture on what I now assume was a craft beer bottle strewn along with the forgotten waste. There was a rabbit with a shit eating grin on its face giving a thumbs up. Soon after seeing that my eyes led me to the source of the sounds.   It was a kneeling yet slumped, convulsing pile. Then she looked up. It was the homeless woman from earlier. I stumbled back and recoiled in fear. "She must have knocked over the trash can and hurt herself" I thought. The thought seems innocent now, and I wish it would have been the case.  Her tattered black hoodie was caked in what appeared to be vomit and bodily fluids. It was still fresh because I remember the smell overwhelming me. Then I saw it, there was a needle jutting out of her arm. At the time I couldn't comprehend what it was, or why the woman was acting so strange. It's that innocence I wish I could still possess.   But no, this woman was overdosing. She was dying. In front of my eyes, this woman was dying and I couldn't do jack shit to save her. I was a kid, and I was afraid.   She looked up at me and her lips seemed to try to form words, but nothing happened.  Merely shaking and more trembling before she fell and slumped even further on to the grimey alley ground. The look still haunts me, it still causes me to have panic attacks or throw up if I picture it well enough. The best way I can explain it without forcing myself to think too much about it, is milk with a little blue dye in it. That's what her skin looked like.  She feebly reached out at my pant leg. I stepped back more, and then she slumped over. I wasn't sure if she was dead, but I nudged her with my foot. She didn't move. She was dead, she had to be.   I screamed. I screamed louder than I ever will in my life. I ran after that, probably the fastest I'd ever run too. I ran back the way I came, past the stupid fucking rabbit bottle, past the flyers, past the market area where I was before. I only stopped when I reached the gift shop area.  I cried. I cried more than I ever will I think. I never cared for my grandparents, let alone any of my relatives, but I was elated to find them browsing the selection of shirts. They were wondering why I was crying.  I eluded to the fact that I watched a woman die, and rather just told them I was hysterical because I was lost. I still wish that was the case looking back.   I feel, like a part of me died when that woman died. I feel like watching anybody die an untimely and violent death would kill something inside of anybody. Seattle was, and is, a beautiful city with beautiful sights.   I am never going back there though. I'm going to leave whatever part of me died there. That's the way it's meant to be.

I feel, like a part of me died when that woman died. I feel like watching anybody die an untimely and violent death would kill something inside of anybody. Seattle was, and is, a beautiful city with beautiful sights.   I am never going back there though. I'm going to leave whatever part of me died there. That's the way it's meant to be.                   Vorpie save us from debt. Pls. Debt. Too strong.    Put off watching Cowboy Bebop for far too long because so many other shows seemed more appealing. I thought, "Oh old show, so it must be drawn old and gross."   After listening to some of the soundtrack and a friend bugging me to watch it too much, I fired up Deluge and torrented that mother. Two words. Holy shit.  The whole story was amazing, the animation and art style was **leagues** ahead of the time. For 1998 it's a really pretty show. That coupled with the great soundtrack and story bumped it up into my top five.  If you've been putting off watching this show or feel iffy about it, watch it. 9/11 would watch again.            Holy fuck more Steins;Gate anime on the way, also I just read the Epigraph shit and I'm shitting my pants.    Just the question above I guess. I've watched everything I can and I want to prepare myself for Steins;Gate Zero so I thought this would be my best course of action  Edit: Found them online and read them all, holy fuck         Man, probably the second worst case of post anime watching bummer feels I've had. Overall probably my new favorite slice of life with Sakurasou no Pet na Kanojo in a close second. I just feel like it ended more completed with more material that hasn't been made into anime that isn't crap. 10/10 would recommend.    Edit: Exclamation points are part of show title, I don't type with that much emotion            I sat in the empty desk in front. I don't like being this far up in the row.   Edit: Pretty sure she saw the title of this post since it's in bold blue lettering. I'm autistic.    Okay guys, finished up the patch, used the colors I was told to, and touched up all of the parts that were too detailed.   [Here it is] (http://i.imgur.com/KkUDwVR.png)  Thoughts, concerns, things, memes?   [DISCUSS] (http://i.imgur.com/QwWVIf9.gif)         Genuine question here since people are naturally social creatures and women need men to reproduce?   Okay so after some discussion and shit in the mod chat I've made [this revised patch idea.] (http://i.imgur.com/fDVxD2i.png)  Other options I'm considering is making the coat of arms thing red again but let's see how the blue works for you guys. Discuss and shit. I don't know about any of the financial stuff.           So I recently posted here asking for somebody to vectorize something, [this image in question.] (http://i.imgur.com/N89cDnO.png) and I need another quick favor. I've tried using threshold stuff and doing some of the things you guys reccomended but I just couldn't get the same effect as the picture above.   If someone here could vectorize [this] (http://i.imgur.com/7ggq37x.jpg) image that would be awesome. Thanks!   After a somewhat busy past week, sketchy promises, browsing dank memes, and trying to erase a piece of the patch for about ten minutes after realizing it was food on the screen, I finished the patch idear for the official /r/a_irsoft patch.   Here's a little album, http://imgur.com/a/x6LBh  The font choice was the hardest thing so if there are any other ideas speak up and I'll throw it together. Otherwise I need thoughts, opinions, what to fix, and other stuff.     Can somebody vectorize [this] (http://i.imgur.com/TqCAU8e.png) image for me?   Similar to [this] (http://crissia.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/jack.jpg) or [this?] (http://www.vectors4all.net/preview/chigevara-face-free-vector.jpg)      This is kind of hard to explain, but when I airsoft I feel like a different person. When I started airsoft obviously [I had really bad gear and bad guns] (http://i.imgur.com/nmtS8ZN.jpg) and I thought, "I'm going to get better and get better gear." Ever since the days of plinking around with friends with our springers and LPEG's between jam sessions I knew airsoft was a different hobby.   When I airsoft I feel stronger, and I feel like buying more gear makes airsoft me stronger. It's weird.       The sticky post on top of the sub has been too tantalizing for me and I'm ready to throw a design together and help get these patches made, so let's talk about it. Where/how are they going to be made and who do I give the design to? Are we gonna make this happen?   If so, I'm making it after work tonight and I'll post up the design once I'm done.   Edit: Home from work and going to begin work once I brew me up some coffee and get brainstorming.    That is all. Continue.    It only made redditing and browsing dank memes easier though.                     	138
 Because Jim Carrey doesnt like sequels and just recently relented.   Paula Patton    Ah man im gonna miss it I actually liked it mostly for Karen.    Interesting very interesting I had no idea. Also know who ALbert Fish is and wow.    Yes hes a villain but not really if ya know wat I mean. Plus he tried to call it off too but was too late.    ???????    Yeah I kinda wish they had stayed with Evil Jigsaw in the sequels.    Is it just me or is Jigsaw on the original Saw a lot more cruel. In all the other movies he says he despises killing people yet Gordon is ordered to kill Adam and he also slashes Tapps throat. Its like he is much more of a psychopath in that one and all the others he seems like a vigilante.    Because he had money problems.    Okay cool thanks   I have always wondered.    OMG YES!!!!!!!!!    When is this movie coming out damit!!!!!    that would give me nightmares    maybe    Because they were just a waste it seemed like.    I will force it out of you. Okay so heres how it goes I understand that you gave birth to me and you care for me but dont freakin talk to me like you understand my life alright. Your such a freaking hypocrite also. I HATE when you drink it makes you into an obnoxious bitch I cant wait to get out of here and i will NEVER call you when I leave for the last time. Oh yeah one more thing when I give my opinion to you you tell me to leave but you have the right to tell me yours all the freaking time?? That makes no sense like at all.    My apologies    Now thats a working man.    I think you know    Thanks yeah she was I miss her so much now.    Do you just live to annoy me in the most subtle way??? Why is it you always do things that annoy me so much. Like when I want to be alone you come in and steal my solitude from me. Also you never do what is expected of you.    She died the other day I miss her so much already my beautiful Daisy I will miss taking her for walks.    They will hand it to some one who will be a puppet basically.    Jesus you watch The two Hobbit movies all the dam time its like the only movies you watch!!!! Why are you so obsessed with them??? This year alone you must have seen them both 5 times each whats so special about them?? I mean I like Hobbit and LOTR too but not that much. You always complain when you say I rewatch movies but your worse then me you freakin idiot.    That has happened to me 3 times for Dont be afraid of the dark, the raid 2, and recently Tusk. It is an awesome experience!!!!! U can text and switch seats as many times as u want to. When I saw The Raid 2 I sat in like 10 different seats.    Yeah its just too much.    Isnt it annoying when they announce a date for a movie trailer?? I mean we have already been waiting for some footage for months possibly even years dont make us wait longer just release the dam thing.    Yeah but probably not.    I always get there at least 15 minutes before the movie starts if its a new movie I get there earlier tho. I cannot watch a movie in the theater without a snack so I always get a popcorn and soda depending on the length sometimes candy too. I always sit in the middle so i dont have to crane my head or not. I ALWAYS put seasoning in my popcorn i have been for 3 years now let me think Caramel, Kettle Corn, and Ranch. I dont really eat or drink the snacks during the previews because I like to save it for the movie. I normally go to Harkins Theaters a local chain but sometimes I will go to AMC for a 5 dollar movie. Sometimes I go to a dollar theater too they have a special every tuesday movies for 1.50. Anyways those r my habits.      dam stupid marvel    His wife has only been in his movies I believe. She basically has no career except in his movies.    Yes those are the main 3.    Man that really bites.    $7 exactly sometimes 7.50 depending on the chain I go to, I usually always get in at matinee price during the evening because I have a student ID.    The Catcher in The Rye dam JD and his family so stubborn.       Good finale Good show gonna miss it.    Good finale I got annoyed with all the flashbacks tho still good poor nucky.    UGH I hate when this happens I mean it has prospect and it has Robin Wiliiams so its guaranteed to make money.    The Cabin in the Woods    I was just thinking of watching this show now    Unless its still playing in some theaters then u will have to wait til late november when some torrents hit.    All Halloween movies, All Friday the 13th movies, and all Nightmare on Elm Street movies.    I just realized that John Wick was released yesterday the same day that the show Constantine premiered on NBC. is that weird???    "When I arrive at my destination I am gonna Kill Bill"    Its the only time someone actually says Star Trek in Star Trek    One of my favorite scary kids movies ever!!!!    Its just sitting there noone is touching it sadly I really want to see them too.    I thought it was an okay movie good cast and good direction.    OOOH LOL!!!!!!!!    Okay I get it you are a homophobe you dont like Gays now please STOP saying everytime even the smallest mention of a gay person you criticize it. So annoying everytime I watch Modern Family you comment about Cam and Mitch its getting fucking old!!!! Im slowly starting to think you are in the closet like that guy on American Beauty.    WTF    Mr Marks doesnt like to be fucked by anyone excet Mrs Marks!!!!!!    Does he look like a Bitch!!!!!!    Ullysses Something.    AHHHH man I liked this show. Gonna miss it.    Interesting theory I wouldnt be surprised if it was the truth.    Yes great episode last night cant wait for the finale but I am gonna miss this great show.    Yes me too I hope it lives up to expectations.    He was a scottish sailor who made a deal with calypso to ferry souls who died at sea to the other side.    a rant    I thought we were friends in real life we had some good convos together but for some reason you refuse to add me??? I want to see what your life is like and you wont add me you suck!!!!    Yes you are.    Man I wish I can erase my mind and watch that movie again for the first time i was so blown away when I finally saw it.    aha sure    Harry Potter survived in Deathly Hallows because of the piece of Voldemort inside him he survived because he became the master of the Deathly Hallows.    Jack Nicholson and Quentin Tarantino    If its already filming why not release it next year?? It is a directtodvd and those dont cost too much.    Nice musical scene    Its just a limited release in the next few weeks it will get more.     OMG I hate the dam news you watch it every dam night!!!!! Sometimes multiple times a day and they just replay the same stories over and over!!!! When you miss just one of them you get annoyed well who cares. When I get my own place I will NEVER watch the news and when you visit and ask to watch it I will not let you!!!!!! I dont know why you are obsessed with that stupid show anyways.    What r some??    Cant wait to see wat they do to Juice.    Yeah im surprised he didnt tell Nero or Alvarez the man really wants to die.    Yes    Just say that he wasnt actually Spiderman by that time.    K I will probably just get new ones tho    They didnt really show him its weird. Would have loved to see him.    okay cool    So I was listening to my headphones today and the left side all of a sudden stopped working. I messed around with it a little bit but then I had to position the cord into a certain position just to hear it out of both sides. I dont want to get rid of them but what is wrong with them?? Can they be fixed cheaply??    LOL thanks    Tom Cruise in Tropic Thunder    Oh god yes!!!!!    Yes just have them make the amazing spiderman movies intigrated into the mcu.    It came out in March    Like the shortest amount of time that a trailer was released between the film itself?? Was there ever one that was weeks before a movie opened??    The one where Lucille tells George Michael that Maebe "spent her inheritence getting here". I laughed when I first heard that scene.       Yeah so that means season 4 of Arrow will be Oliver in prison.    Yeah.................................yeah.    Thomas Jane    I think I found my new job LOL    Awesome thank you!!!!!!    Okay well thats not right    Yeah noone major wants to work with him its a shame cuz he is such a good actor.    Its sad that most of the former james bonds arent that big anymore.    HAHAH I remember that episode    OMFG dude wow!!!!!    He didnt like being a star so he only does smaller stuff nowadays.    Yeah shes nothing nowadays man she used to be the queen of the world.    He still makes stuff he had a few movies this last year.    Okay cool    o okay alright thanks love reacher    I mean there is an arc or something that follows a story 61 hours and worth dying for it says they have a story or something.    YES!!!!!!!    So I just got back from the library and the only reacher novel they had is A Wanted Man I looked it up and it said it is part of another storyline. Do I need to read the other books 61 hours and worth dying for in order to understand this one?? Id hate to have to take it back.    I think he just made a shit ton of money that he didnt think he could work again except for Rush Hour but I did like him in Silver Linings Playbook.    He says he is semi retired but he hasnt done a movie for like 4 years so lets just say he is retired.    He burned a lot of bridges and stuff and noone wants to work with him anymore. I dont think his career an be saved.    Joffrey and then Cersei.   	111

 YOOOOOOO!!!! I need more pat samples [Post them here!](http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoBestFriendsPlay/comments/2tslr7/dose_anyone_have_any_audio_clips_of_pat_they/)      yes...   Someone bug ultra pancake on twitter to make this happen NAO!!   I'm working on a song and all it needs is an angry leprechaun       Frenchcore is a genre, it's known for its punchy synthetic kicks   Hmmm, I get what your saying I kind of feel the same way about hands-up, plus this isn't the best example of a Frenchcore kick. [Heres a better example](http://youtu.be/ymzJeo-3b1I)      Rage is the embodiment of pure blackness and rage   Today class we will go over proper cunilingus edict "later during class" oops I droped my pen *gigles as she bends over to pick it up*    Thanks man! that was going to bug me...   I can't bleave I forgot it's name, it's the one where the girl puts a bag in between her legs and shakes her butt until she gets tired all while going "hado! hado! hado! hado!"   Sure thing! Frenchcore is known for its extremely synthetic punchy kicks [Heres a song by hellfish](http://youtu.be/EjKmr3lllsw)   RWC is making a Frenchcore alias the only thing is he can think of a name. So why don't we help him out!      F F F 3respektz5u   I really like Darude, his tech mix of "in the darkness" is fantastic   Venetian Snares, the things that man has made just blow my mind, 7/4 for life!      Not bad, the percussion was a little too loud, this has a lot of great ideas so just keep at it :) p.s. PM me one of your FLPs sometime it would be fun to collab with you   Ya pyramid head go ahead and take that pipe from Alex, he's a chode anyway   Occasionally you will hear a scream coming from rage's chest, when that happens rage sends out his soul to beat up the soul that screamed.   :O   Sorry :(, I feel pretty embarrassed now because I just figured out the beat grid, I was doing two notes per measure instead of 8 (I thought I was doing correctly). Sorry if I came off as a D-bag, no hard feelings? :(   p.s. RULES OF NATURE!!!      I've been doing that and I'm still not 100% happy with it and as for how it sounds [You'd be surprised](http://youtu.be/kM73tcr16Rs)   EDIT: please don't down vote this. Everyone has a right to their own opinion but just because you don't like terrorcore doesn't mean you should down vote my post/comment     you might be wondering why anyone would want to go faster then 522, well that's because I'm making a terrorcore song and I want it to be 666 BPM :D, I've gone past 522 before but I cant remember how. Can someone help me out?   great song but not exactly what I'm looking for, come to think of it the stuff I'm looking for would probably be classified as Big Room/Main Stream house :/ any ways heres another [example](https://soundcloud.com/fiveandadime/5-a-dime-tempo-6-59-songs-in-an-hour-1) (start at 46:34) P.S. this mix actually has a lot of the kind of music I'm looking for        I'm looking for a certain kind of electro house. It's a little difficult to describe but I'm looking for stuff with massive build-up's and drops that focus on one crazy sound. [The best example I have is this song](http://youtu.be/UEDF_IRT9NM)   Sure thing :)      They haven't, I just posted this because the zaibatsu/people on here love Jojo :)   If it was the other way around it would be OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO   You expected Summer Lovin' but it was me DIO!!!   [actually....](http://avielsusej.deviantart.com/art/Mordo-s-Regular-Adventure-Polnarigby-H5-Chariot-408212982)   Those snoop samples just add so much!         just look at that smile!      Jeasus that red head was a bitch.....   The game really goes to shit in the second act when you go to town. Here's a list of reasons why the town sucks: 1. Grey brown and rainy, 2. zombies that are on fire 3. Zombies with helmets 4. Zombies with BASIC weapons that can do STUPID amounts of damage (they can also throw the weapons) 5. The Ram    Ain't that the truth, I completed one when I was still in the hotel and went up to like level 60 but all the weapons stayed at level 1 2   although she dose have a lazy eye... but I have to admit that she was the LEAST hate-able character from the game       Ya RWC gets it right      No Sam B 0/10 - IGN, in all seriousness this game looks like everything dead island should have been in the first place (I sold and re-bought dead island twice and pat was super right the game just falls apart around the end) I REALLY tried to enjoy it but I just couldn't    Chili dogs   :D p.s. [heres his remix of native faith](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8giKbzcxA-E)    Thanks :D that means a lot coming from the based freq himself!   Hmmm....

But if I had to say one it would be a new appreciation for Japanese developed ps2 games    http://www.ppf2014.info/ found this awhile ago and I really love it    love this song!    I entered "Noisia" Crule   Unusual and got this:   Stand Name: Centepod  Stand Ability: [Life Link](http://powerlisting.wikia.com/wiki/Life_Link)   Power - A  Speed - D  Range - C  Durability - A  Precision - E  Potential - D  Ophidian Between the candle and the star:  Stand Name: Harlequin  Stand Ability: [Web Breath](http://powerlisting.wikia.com/wiki/Web_Breath)   Power - A  Speed - E  Range - A  Durability - B  Precision - B  Potential - D         Ophidian is one of my favorites (also checkout his crossbreed alias Meander)   one of the more interesting trapstyle songs I have heard      Ha I wish, but seriously I am hyped for this!   I tried :( it's giving me an error now sadly I think I'll have to reinstall FL    :)      The most important thing is did you like it?   another one from you. This time its happy hardcore :3   if your looking to get into tech trance I would recommend Darude, I'm serious his rush album is great!    did you do the cover art for this priz?   dose any one know how to fix this?   Good: Ophidian, The Outside Agency, Nosferatu, Art of fighters, Digital punk, Massive New Krew, Radical Redemption, Meander, The Prophet, Yandere Complex and The Dark Oscillators   Bad: Body Lotion (srsly wtf), You, Psycho 909, Tone, The Wild Motherfuckerz and The Donkey Rollers    Oh and for future reference, the stuff your looking for is called Happy Hardcore and/or UK Hardcore (just incase you want to find more :D)   I agree with you on the bass. Anyways if you like this then keep an eye on F3tch, he just released a collab with Gawtbass and he has an EP coming out on NSD:BL on the 26      Check out some [freeform](http://youtu.be/O2El0dpEYH0) this is a mix for a free compilation and the DL for said comp. is in the description :)   Woa.. I always thought it was just his website. That's awesome!   Since my last post did better then expected, I decided why not post some more Japanese music. This time it's Gabber :) p.s. Checkout more of Kobaryo's stuff, he is a god      EVE gave you a lot of good suggestions so check those guys out. The only other person I can think of that EVE didn't mention is DJ Shimamura (nanobii loves him)   Japanese DnB is like a milk shake. Sweet and satisfying! p.s. check out more of you's stuff, he's really good       But blur doesn't have a sound track by Noisia c: (I've never played blur and I'm not hating on it I just really love Noisia)   Ya I can definitely imagine driving down a highway to this. Sun setting as my Delorean rolls down the coast at 66MPH   Glad I could help :)   Made by me :), not asking for feed back on this just take a listen if you need to zone out for awhile         Oh! One last important thing, if you want to find some great music look for touhou remixes. Just search touhou schranz, hardstyle, hard trance, nu-style. Etc and your bound to find some good songs :) some of my faveorite songs being ice cheinsaw by moro nuclear blast by siromaru and bad apple by Shingo Dj   Words to live by    ooohhh.... name your price :)    Hello everyone, I was just looking at the reddit comments for the drift stage video and I noticed that some of you seem to like retro/80's synth music. So please; sit down, make yourself comfortable, pop a boner and let's circlejerk about some music! :)  *unzips pants* I'll start, I'm absolutely in love with the hotline Miami sound track, all the songs just fit so well, their psychedelic but still danceable. As for artist I love Mitch Murder if you don't know who he is then let me tell you why you should love him, 4 words: [He remixed Guiles theme](https://soundcloud.com/daataa/mitch-murder-guiles-theme)   Motherfuckers act like they don't know about [Mitch Murder](http://youtu.be/hugowO0sSrM)  P.S. If your still not convinced [heres](https://soundcloud.com/daataa/mitch-murder-guiles-theme) his remix of guiles theme      Oh massive circleZ isn't an artist, their compilation albums released by massive new krew, so far their have been 4   Sure thing :)  Edit: actually I don't know a lot of Japanese Hardstyle artists either :/ The two consistent artists I know of are Shingo Dj and Massive New Krew, again the thing I noticed is most artists produce all kinds of hard dance, not just Hardstyle   Fuck ya! Japanese hardstyle!   I look at who some of my fav artists are following on soundcloud   Heck yes 3 love roughsketch   Maybe an artists logo is hidden in the pic?   [Japanese stream hardcore 4 album preview](http://youtu.be/IZRvaeJUKjw) my favorite song from this album is clock control by Kobaryo, the melody is spot on   [Massive Circlez 2 cross fade demo](http://youtu.be/IZRvaeJUKjw) all the Massive Circlez compilations are gold, most Japanese producers make all kinds of hard dance but the massive new krew consistantaly make Hardstyle so check them out  As for buying these... Well most Japanese releases I've seen are physical copy only and they are only available from various Japanese websites (so unless you speak Japanese or your browser translates it for you, you might have a hard time finding out if the CD's are still in stock / if they ship outside of Japan). the Japanese stream hardcore comps. Are on iTunes as for the Massive Circlez you might have to result to torrenting. I can PM you the torrent file if need be   It doesn't matter where their from :) let me rephrase my question "what is your favorite hardstyle producing country?" (Go indeapth about it, I like the food, the culture, the kicks. Etc) I should have clarified that, sorry :(   Japan FTW!!!  EDIT: I really like Japanese Hardstyle   Hardcore because their kicks sound a lot diffrent from most Italian / Dutch Hardstyle   Hardcore. Plus anime samples sound really cool if used well    You can find some defqon and q dance related stickers kicking around online (along with other events/festivals) I don't have any links for those sorry :( but if your into hardcore I do have a link to the MOH [store](http://store.mastersofhardcore.com/moh-car-sticker)   Woa man, forget music in your blood, its in your DNA, it's part of your biological code (I guess that's why you guys were called bioweapon huehuehue)   Ever wonder how pat stays so short and angry? Well now you know, pure 100% Irish piss    You can't imagine how much fun were having by atmosphere. Slug is a poet personal fav from the album being "say hey their" also check out their song "god loves ugly"      all while the Joestars cheer rage on for fear of being curb stomped    OMG! THE JOESTAR MEN v.s RAGE v.s DIIIOOOO!!   More like 1/4 of a man 1/2 of a man and a full pie theif   Let's get to know each other alittle better :) you don't need to say a lot about yourself if you don't want to so one little fact is all I ask.  My name is Ethan and I love mass effect! Biotic for life! (But you probably knew that I loved ME)   Anyways I love all things hard (hard as in hard dance... I saw your mind in the gutter there) but seriously Hard house, hard trance, hardstyle, hardcore. Etc, I love everything about it especially hard trance (speaking of which if your into listening to music and gaming Hard trance+ME=bliss)    True that :)   Interesting.... Mind elaborating?  (      )     For me it would have to be Seth Green. I would love to pick his brain a bit (also their should really be a ME robot chicken skit)   THIS SOUNDS LIKE A CONVERSATION THAT WOULD BE IN JOJO'S BIZARRE ADVENTURE!!!    sorry if these kind of posts are looked down on. if you want a good laugh I highly recommend checking out the rest of the page I got this from        I guess if your really, and I mean reeeaaaallllyyyy into being choked you would be happy      I'm still waiting on plague to draw some fan art of the lizard girls :T   Disclaimer!!!!!!: I did not make this! All credit goes to "NotAnAnimator" I saw how little views this video had and saw that it hadn't been posted here yet so I decided why not post it and help it get more views :) (sorry for any confusion)      Keep in mind this is a radio rip. So it could get better      In this off beat adventure set way up north in Canada a solider who is not well liked by his unit and a AI who wants nothing more then to destroy all of humanity fall in love and decide to run off across the small 30 mile island all while being pursued by the incompetent unit commander, the smoker, mutants with shotguns on their arms and the creators of the AI who know she's good deep down. Can our young lovers keep their gear from degrading? Will the solider ever put a point into psi powers so he can finally use kinetic redirection? Will the AI ever stop making fun of humans and their shitty skin and organs? I don't know maybe.... Ya maybe. Find out if your questions will ever be answered on April 11th, 1999 all while listening to a sound track that's made up of orchestral music and 1999 DnB and trance with lazy flanging to make it more trancy!   If I ever decide to have a fallout party I would like a sound track to match :) the only two songs I know of currently are [Paradise Falls by Geck-e](http://youtu.be/3VO6NBZNNAI) and [War never changes by Psycho 909](http://youtu.be/Ox9OvRvXebQ)   *Shodan procides to project a full body video feed in your cyber interface, as you ogle her sexy, luscious robo body you fail to notice a hybrid behind you. He procides to cave your skull in with a pipe and steal your cyber interface so the entire flesh can enjoy the fruits of their "mothers" body. You did not survive the adventure." (BTW in wrighting this I realize that people will probably think I have a thing for Shodan. I assure you I do not, I mean seriously have you seen her face? She is the definition of a butter face)   And a little stuffed vault boy    I think the closets were going to get to quantum is MTN Dew volt.

 Oh come on, y'all just don't want to admit the 50$ you paid for a Sims 3 expansion that should have already been in the main game is totally worth it. DON'T FORGET THE BF4 BATTLEPACKS.   Ha, just imagine fingering a chick after that :P      You can buy cheap refill kits on eBay. Or actual full cartridges, if you don't like to get your hands dirty.   I bought the Fiji stick on eBay as it isn't available in my country, and it's not that great. Smells like a cleaning product, and stains (not permanently, but still) my dark t-shirts. I use either Wolfthorn or Danger Time, both spray.   8 hours, post it! :)   Not having blue eyes.    Get a good job and be able to afford everything my parent's can't give me right now.

A few years ago, I woke up (only an hour or two after going to bed, so I guess it was a light sleep) and started crying a lot. To this day, I have no idea what I was crying about. WTF   I guess he didn't try "hey bby, wnt sum fuk" :P   Chinese crepe.   Camel toe   To chew with my mouth close. My parents NEVER told me. I remember once in elementary school I was eating cookies when some girl said "Ewwwww, he's chewing!" and I had no idea what I was doing wrong.   Pretty much all "old" technology. Old PCs, old phones, old televisions, Walkman CD players, old video games... technology improved a lot in the last decade, but I still prefer the old tech.   How sharks don't eat underwater fiber cables.   You reverse engineer software to understand how it works, and can then do stuff like bypassing the copy protection, analyzing its malicious behavior (if it's a malware) or fix it.   When I didn't know anything at all about reversing, I started reading [these](http://thelegendofrandom.com/blog/sample-page) tutorials. The first ones will introduce you to reverse engineering/cracking, and teach you to use the (main) tool to crack software, called a Disassembler. A Disassembler converts binary/hexadecimal code to instructions of Assembly code.  You see, you can't easily "edit" an .exe. After the guys who make a software program it, they compile it to the .exe, and it's all converted to Assembly code. Assembly code is incredibly confusing and no one in 2014 still programs in it, it's really only used in reversing. [Here's](http://www.ollydbg.de/Pics/OllyDbg2.gif)  what it looks like. I know it looks like hell, but those tutorials I mentioned will explain the basics. At some point, though, you'll want to learn Assembly to make sense of ALL of it.  The disassembler you'll be using is called OllyDBG, the one in that picture. It's included in the tutorials, as everything you possibly need. With it you can see that Assembly code that makes-up programs, see the text strings they have, etc.  They start by teaching you how to crack simple software known as "Crackmes". After a while, easy commercial software will be included, so you can practice on real targets.  By the end of this tutorial, you should be able to crack simple commercial software, although this can be reeaaaly time consuming. Please note cracking DRM like Origin, Steam and Battle.net is much harder than the targets you'll be cracking, and you might only be able to do this after years of reversing.  [Tuts4you](https://forum.tuts4you.com) is a community of reversers who's always glad to help you. One rule, though, is to NEVER give info about what software you're trying to crack.   So here's the more in depth explanation :) Cheers!    They are, actually :P  in simple protections, at least   See [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/2c8kns/whats_the_most_interesting_underrated_hobby/cjd3m33) post I made.   Ha, it is indeed. I've spent 15+ hours trying to patch an unpacked VisualBasic program, but still can't. By going deeper into the calls before the conditional jumps that decide *goodboy* or *badboy*, I couldn't find the place where the serial verification is done at startup, and that can get frustrating.    Not until now. Thanks for the heads up, it's an interesting read :)   I don't think it's legal, but as long as you make sure the software doesn't connect to the Internet, and don't upload it anywhere, you should be fine. I recommend [these](http://thelegendofrandom.com/blog/sample-page) absolute begginer tutorials. If you have questions about stuff, there's [this](https://forum.tuts4you.com/) forum with tons of people who are into reversing software.   Oh...

 Yeah well, ours is better, take that!   Adderall IS amphetamine.    What is the right measurement of laughter?   Why do people say it gets better? How can life get better when your future is ruined by an illness inside of your brain? I actually have 2-3 of those illnesses inside my brain. My future is gone, why should I continue and just suffer all the way through it, why can't I be mercy killed, peacefully? I know I may not be terminally ill, but I am chronically ill that makes me wish I was terminally ill just so my suffering would end. How can it get better, when it's already destroyed?    CS  Heroin.   Looks like super high sens or super high accel, either way, turn that shit down.    Every time I watch a pasha stream I want to play again... Then I realize I'm not pasha.    Vicodin wont make you spout stupid shit. This guy is just fucked up... Or *trolling*.   Oh.. My.. God... THAT'S why there's always smoke there... God dammit.   Anti-Psychotics slow down or stop your metabolism all together. I don't get appetite increase that much, maybe I eat a 100 or so more calories than a normal person.   There is also no way that someone that used to NEVER put on weight put on 80-90 pounds in 11-12 months. It's not possible without eating at McDonalds everyday, every night and every midnight.   When you say "meds don't cause weight gain"... Steroids do and so do Anti Psychotics...  [here's the evidence, found on the Quetiapine wiki](http://gyazo.com/b363db4cfe0c7a5bd501eb8b1870eff5)   Even though I've got somewhat "clinically" better, I now don't see the point in continuing this life. I've lost most of my education (I was a very smart/good student), I've gained about 85-90 pounds in a fucking year from this medication and I don't even eat a lot, I eat normally. I could've went back to my school yesterday, but because I'm so overweight I can't bear the reactions I would get, I don't feel good at all. I have chronic pain as well, and it's undiagnosed because no one cares to help me.   What can I really do in society? I'm nothing, I can't even function when I'm "better".     Jesus gives you morals and the bible is the most moral book in history... /s   Gold Nova 3-4 is a lot different from a silver. I've personally never been in silver longer than a day or so though.    I hate it when people do things like this. I also hate it when someone rages because they don't do good one game but when they do great the next game (better than you) they say, "I'm so bad", in a snarky, passive aggressive way (I'm not talking about random's here).    Yeah, I think I just didn't make it clear enough like you did.    "And fentanyl isn't dangerous"... Then he deserves to go shoot up 5mg.    Are you 100% sure about that?   I think it causes people to focus on it too much and get upset when they rank a little lower. It also causes "elitism" among players. I myself don't like it but at the same time I do like it. I just don't like how it lowers my rank even though I carry my team but we still loose.    That depends on height, type of girl etc.    I could eat all of these 10x over.    What about Opiates?   Sure.   Every pistol round is a panic.    Yet when you hear an accent like mine (Scottish) I bet you get mad because you can't understand me. I don't blame you though, I can hardly understand myself.    I usually have a lesser appetite. The only "drug" that's gave me hardcore munchies was a lot of weed.   What? How is that weird? Your classmates seem immature.     But what if he thought that giving her this gift would get him at least a date?   Leading people on is NOT fair, at all. Just don't accept gifts if you know that this will potentially lead him to believe that there is a chance of dating you.    Yep, I agree totally.    Wait, what? How do you not know what any of these are... Common knowledge I thought.    She seems kinda annoying and bitchy. Don't buy expensive shit for girls when they'll just friend zone you harder and harder.       Sorry for not posting anything in the text box... Updated.   I wouldn't jump to schizophrenia just yet...   Do they not test for fentanyl and fentanyl analogues?    Glad you're not another statistic. Always test your shit before you do it. It was most likely fentanyl, fucking retarded cut if you ask me, but whatcha gonna do when the government illegalizes drugs and makes them unsafe?  Again, glad you're okay.   Sorry I didn't put anything here, I didn't know exactly what to put. I asked this question because I started LISTENING to William Burroughs read the book and got quite hooked, still haven't finished it though as it's 3 hours long... Gonna listen on and off, seems really good.   I just wanna know what you think about it.    Welcome, and enjoy your stay... *dark laugh*.    3:54 is probably the best part.    Don't beat a dead horse.   It'll come back like people here have said. It's usually the other way around for me, usually I have 0 sex drive when I'm using and it comes back with a vengeance when I get clean.    That's fucked up man, punch him right in the dick.   I just got my script filled (Scotland here), and I overheard someone trying to fill their opiate script and the person working there said, "Sorry, this is a controlled drug so you need a recent script (or whatever), but if you just go over to the doctors office I'm sure they'll write it for you and once they do, just come back over and we'll fill it"... So atleast there's some good people working at pharmacies.    I wish I was a rat... I would get all kinds of drugs all the time.    Do you take them longer than 1 month straight?   But subs basically make you dependent on THEM. It's like trading one thing for another, and the other doesn't even make you feel good...   *I guess they just stopped giving a fuck*... Truest thing I've read lately.    Why can't you guys buy codeine OTC? You can seem to do it in almost every other country.    I always hide my shit because I always go looking for shit when I'm sick and I usually find it, it feels like winning the lottery even though I put it there.    That taste smell combo when you're coming up is amazing.    As people said, alcohol and apap will hurt your liver, but drinking + opiates, can kill you, and has killed people through respiratory depression.    Morphine is made to be shot up, oral and snorting bio sucks so much.    Yep, pharma grade heroin is clear as water.    It most likely wasn't just heroin, it was most likely cut with fentanyl as well.    Si.    Yes, yes you do. *hugs*   This is what professional means...    I wouldn't call them "anonymous **PSYCHOPATHS**". Most people on the internet that send death threats are just people that can't take their inner rage out at someone in real life, so do so to someone they hate over the internet.    He just said he was 1.    ESEA: Here Valve, this is how you do it.   Or it's British for disgusting, dirty etc.    Best strategy.   JW's name shouldn't be 'JWonderchild' it should be 'JWanker'...    I wouldn't say you're schizophrenic at all. Schizophrenia is a chronic illness, and the early signs are usually there for years before you get a full blown episode, and months (sometimes years) you get a prodrome which is basically the illness leading up to the illness.   You're just paranoid, people with bipolar can get paranoid too you know.  I'm schizophrenic btw, if that means anything.   It's really good. I'm so bad at ready walls of text though because I usually miss lines... Upvoted.   His poetry usually makes no sense at all, it's actually really amusing.    Mixing Ambien w/heroin is just about as dangerous as mixing benzos and dope.    In my view, I think that if you legalize heroin for 21+ at about 2.5g per 2-3 days then that would actually help more people than it hurts. Getting heroin off the street is what makes heroin dangerous. Pharma grade diamorphine (heroin) is no worse than oxycodone, morphine etc... Hydromorphone is actually stronger I believe.   Over here in the UK we already use diamorphine medically, and not just for terminally ill patients either.   Edit: Nothing ever happens over night, and nothing ever happens if we just sit on our asses and do nothing because we think it's impossible.    Are you against recreational legalization?   Yep... Most drugs that have been highly researched (including most opiates) should be legal.    I do believe how things are worded matter, I just don't think anyone should really care about it if we kinda know what he meant... You know what I mean?    Man, who cares on how he worded it? Cut the dude some slack.   I know that my life may not be completely ruined but I just can't help that I could've done so much more if it weren't for me being "ill". I've even said to my self, "what's the point in going back if I'm a year and a bit behind everyone". Nothing feels like a huge accomplishment, it feels more like a completely failure in my life, and that I've dug a hole that I can't get out of because of something that I couldn't have controlled, or maybe I could've controlled it... I don't know any more.   I have positive times where I say to myself, "maybe school just isn't/wasn't for me right now and that I've learned a lot of stuff myself and maybe that'll come in handy", but no one else seems to agree... I know that I have to go back to school, that's not what I am even saying to people, I'm just saying that I've learned a lot of somewhat useful things while I wasn't at school, but people always seem to disagree when I bring that up thinking that I mean that I won't go back to school, and it shoots my confidence all the way back down again.   Thank you for making me feel better and actually listening to what I have to say, unlike others in my life right now.   My man Vincent, you always have money... You need more opiates for that money you always got.    Damn man, to be fair, I would probably do that haha. You would have taken them again if you did, most likely.   If it's stealing illegal drugs, then it's a little different because I doubt that the guys that got robbed are gonna go to the cops and complain that their heroin was stolen.    Fires smell good... I don't know why, but they do.   Note: I don't set stuff on fire.    Quick question though... Is it possible to EVER take stuff from the pharmacy, in small quantities, because I've heard of pharmacists doing that.    I never understood why people don't like opiates, whereas people like us do? I'm on a mission to find out...   Note: We were nauseas on them first too, so it can't be that.    I'm not a girl, I'm just fat as fuck lol, but I've never had good veins, even when I was a normal weight... They're always hiding, even nurses/doctors have a hard time.    I'd like to point this out, as crazy as this may sound /s... Giving someone a syringe that they are paying for is extremely humane. How would you like it if you were addicted to heroin, and no one gave you a clean rig, and you contracted a life threatening disease, like Hep C and HIV?    I literally can never see my veins... I always wanted veins like those, *sigh* maybe in another life. Hope you enjoy that shit.    I don't really know where to start, but I'll try anyway. I was diagnosed with Psychosis NOS about a year and a few months ago, then it progressed into a diagnosis of basically schizophrenia, to put it bluntly. With schizophrenia we have 2 blocks of symptoms, negative and positive. Negative is basically, lack of emotion, extreme lack of motivation, poor hygiene, disorganization (which Is pretty strong for me, stronger than the other negative symptoms) etc. Positive symptoms are just basically psychosis. Anyway, because of this, I had do drop out of school, as directed by my doctors. I lost most of my friends, except one and he has always been my best friend, but he's just came back into the picture (which is great btw, when you've been in extreme isolation for a year that shit will touch your heart more than anything). Being in extreme isolation and barely getting sunlight other than the sun rays coming through my window, is extremely depressing especially when you're not in an episode and have to reflect on how this has affecting your life...   I've just started getting tutoring back in my school, once a week... I don't see the point in going back to school any more, I'm already behind everyone, people think I'm stupid because I don't go to school (even though I've learned a lot of stuff on my own in the past year). Schizophrenia (with depression, but depression hasn't been diagnosed, it's probably depression because of the schizophrenia). I feel absolutely hopeless, it's like I can't get something inside my head out... I just want to be normal again, but there's always something inside my mind stopping me. I used to think I would have a good career, have a good life etc... That's all completely ruined now.  I'll answer any question to clarify anything... Thank you.   Here in Scotland we don't have to pay for scripts, you live in England?   Trainspotting.    Everyone knows that green crack doesn't cure anything, it just makes you go insane, kill everyone then turn gay... /s   Kinky...   Why not? I would show this to my boss...   I was watching a little bit of news last night for some reason on TV (I live in the UK), and they still spoke about it a little.    Do you know how the world works? Or do you live in a delusion of grandeur all the time?     Highly contagious Bird Flu is probably my worst fear when it comes to pandemics.    Illuminati confirmed...     I honestly think Half Life 3 or EP3, will still be coming out... You know, they could be doing this all for marketing. Making people wait 10 or maybe 15 years, that could drive sales through the roof when it finally comes out, I would think.    Yeah I figured it might not be used for that, I'm not actually prescribed it for insomnia, I'm prescribed it for schizophrenia but it was nice to have that sleep aid feature... And dude, that sucks, ask your doc for a benzo or something to sleep.    I just got prescribed Seroquel XL 200mg. I used to take 100mg x2 but because it's easier to take 1 pill rather than 2 a day she moved me onto the prolonged release. I am not sleeping when I take it at night, it doesn't even make me tired like the IR versions did, not even one bit... Actually, the first time I took it (which was last night) I was up all night until 9am. I don't understand because Seroquel used to make me pretty tired when I took my night time dose, but the XL doesn't at all... Why is this? I of course take it for Schizophrenia but it was nice to sleep when I took it because I do usually have insomnia as well.    The "weed" smokers that spoke about it non stop and acted higher than they actually where in high school were probably the most annoying people at that time.   That would be cool as hell.   You are incredibly wrong and ignorant.    Well over here in the UK diamorphine (heroin) is given to you when you're in extreme pain and morphine just won't cut it, and heroin is quite big here, especially in Scotland.   EDIT: Usually drug addicts don't use their DOC because it's "cool" btw.    An opiate that doesn't kill you through respiratory depression, meaning you can go as high as you want without dying of respiratory failure. It doesn't cause nausea at any dose whatsoever, and at very, very large doses, is psychedelic and at very, very low doses feels a lot like Amphetamine without the comedown.   Well you do sound fucked... Hard to believe that there is 0 euphoria.   How much did you do? And what ROA?   Poppy Seed Tea. THAT IS ALL... But in all seriousness, OP, morphine is my favourite opiate, but I usually get 'Morphine Oral Solution' which has always worked for me. It is definitely more of a body high, but I always feel great on morphine, whether I get the oral solution or I bang that shit.      That's how aiming usually works in FPS's (besides recoil control). You aim, you shoot (and control recoil) and you kill... What are you trying to get at here?  	103

Are you absolutely sure about that?  Very little has been said about this.....On 22 December 2012, Basque athlete Ivn Fernndez Anaya was competing in a cross-country race in Burlada, Navarre. He was running second, some distance behind race leader Abel Mutai - bronze medalist in the 3,000-meter steeplechase at the London Olympics. As they entered the finishing straight, he saw the Kenyan runner - the certain winner of the race - mistakenly pull up about 10 meters before the finish, thinking he had already crossed the line.  Fernndez Anaya quickly caught up with him, but instead of exploiting Mutai's mistake to speed past and claim an unlikely victory, he stayed behind and, using gestures, guided the Kenyan to the line and let him cross first.  Ivan Fernandez Anaya, a Basque runner of 24 years who is considered an athlete with a big future (champion of Spain of 5,000 meters in promise category two years ago) said after the test: "But even if they had told me that winning would have earned me a place in the Spanish team for the European championships, I wouldn't have done it either. I also think that I have earned more of a name having done what I did than if I had won. And that is very important, because today, with the way things are in all circles, in soccer, in society, in politics, where it seems anything goes, a gesture of honesty goes down well."  He said at the beginning: unfortunately, very little has been said of the gesture. And it's a shame. In my opinion, it would be nice to explain to children, so they do not think that sport is only what they see on TV: violent kicks in abundance, posh statements, fingers in the eyes of the enemy ...

Even though I don't believe in him, I have what most religious people would considered to be an incredibly blessed life, yet many of those who do believe have what would be considered much less blessed a life.

Noticing the placard on one of the train doors: "Children of Buchenwald Coming Home," written in English and French, some of them got on the train and started talking to us. Lulek was sitting next to me, nibbling on an apple.  -   One of the soldiers asked him in Yiddish what he would most like right now. Lulek did not hesitate. Pointing to the soldier's rifle, he said he wanted to kill German murderers. The soldier exchanged glances with his friends and got of the train. A few minutes later he returned, carrying a small rifle with the firing mechanism removed. "Kill as many as you can," he said, giving Lulek the gun.

Also due to interviews with the local community of the wadi they confirmed that wadi Gaza used to flow regularly during the winter season for at least two months and used to bring huge amounts of water. Since the early seventies this amount of water started to decrease considerably due to the built up of [check dams](http://www.appropedia.org/Check_dam) and diversion schemes by Israel on the upper course of the Wadi (Photo.., Annex 3).  Since then the volume and duration of flow has decreased much with some occasional flash floods sweeping down the Wadi bed at wet years.   -  "Interviews with local community of the area clears out that the wetland site till the late sixties (1960's) was much bigger than it is now.

Conclusion: There are no dams and the diversions mitigate flooding.   http://www.unian.info/politics/1048525-novaya-gazetas-kremlin-papers-article-full-text-in-english.html            I guess the movie needing a mock-up of an American aircraft carrier was a flop so they decided to sink it instead  http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2014/03/iran-movie-aircraft-crash-filming.html#      They need one of these  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbRQlQQUXlk   AFP on twitter is now  backpedaling away from their story    [@AFP -#AFP on Monday withdrew a video showing flooding in Gaza which was filed in error without balancing Israeli comment](https://twitter.com/AFP/status/570538566540865538)   AFP on twitter is now  backpedaling away from their story    [@AFP -#AFP on Monday withdrew a video showing flooding in Gaza which was filed in error without balancing Israeli comment](https://twitter.com/AFP/status/570538566540865538)   AFP on twitter is now backpedaling away from their story    [@AFP -#AFP on Monday withdrew a video showing flooding in Gaza which was filed in error without balancing Israeli comment](https://twitter.com/AFP/status/570538566540865538)   AFP on twitter is now backpedaling away from their story   [@AFP -#AFP on Monday withdrew a video showing flooding in Gaza which was filed in error without balancing Israeli comment](https://twitter.com/AFP/status/570538566540865538)  	177

 Thought this was going to be about Syria.   It's amazing what difference a good actor vs. a bad actor can make.  I immediately felt connected to this coffeemate guy.  The lines didn't feel forced and his deliver was perfect.  Bryan Cranston is an amazing actor because he can be anyone, not just Walter White.   Having to wait until 21 to drink legally is insane.

I drove it from 2001-2004 since my dad thought it would be a good car to cut my teeth on, especially since you can open the hood and actually learn about how the thing works. Today's cars are basically computers under the hood.  I remember it felt like you were literally sitting on the ground it was so low.  It also used to get insanely hot in the cab because all of the heat from the engine had to go somewhere.   ITT more questions.   	10
 Coming in Rails 2.1.      This already existed as a well-used plugin, but I just discovered it as a gem, which is much more handy, IMO.               I agree it's a good thing. I look at it as a commercial entity giving to the open-source community, while at the same time making money without which they wouldn't be able to host FOSS repos anyway.     In gem v.1.0.x this is now "gem server" and it's helpfully listed in the list of commands. Prior to that, I had no idea that gem_server existed. Very useful. (use --daemon to run as daemon).        IDEA: There have been a number of a "essential gem" posts, some linked on reddit. What would be cool is if someone made a simple "ruby-gem" site with all the available gems listed (users could submit ones), and the ability to vote and comment on the gems, or a "I use this" button to which ones are actually most used. Or maybe a "gems" section should be added to agilewebdevelopment.com.  Or, perhaps something like this exists and I haven't found it yet.                         	18

He's also downvoting those who don't agree with him, lol. What a butthurt.   But this is /r/thatHappened, of course it did! Mods check $420% the stories so we can get only the truth!   Friedick Nietzsche   I always thought about something in particular that I'd like to share.   We are a very, VERY new species. We're on our very infancy; if we took all the time Earth has existed and compressed it in 24 hours, civilization exists about 4 miliseconds before midnight. Let alone speak about our time since the Universe itself exists. We, in the cosmic scale, exist for no more than a fraction of the blink of an eye.     Yet, we have done so much things. We've traveled to our distant moon, and layed pieces of ourselves in other planets. We have already begin to explore our solar system, in so little time.    What do all things alive want? What's the ultimate instinct of all species? To STAY alive. If you bear that in mind, and also that we have existed for so litte, you'll see that we have yet to evolve a awful lot. I think we'll get to a point in which we'll learn that the best way to survive, is to coopearte with each other. Now, I see that happening in a lot of time, maybe millions of years, but I definitely see that as a real possibility. I believe once we've achieved that point, in which we only wish to survive as a whole species, progress is going to be made a lot, lot faster. We're not as intelligent as we could be, and we know that. Killing ourselves is not the best way to coexist, and maybe one day we'll get pass that.    Now, if you take into account all these things that I said, maybe we could exist for much much longer, and achieve an understanding of spacetime beyond our dimensions. Maybe we'll discover a form of fuel that lets us travel a lot faster and a lot cheaper. Maybe in a long time we'll be able to actually go to other galaxies, to bend and stretch the dimensions of spacetime to our likehood. It's a possibility that I like to imagine.   This is why I think it is actually possible to know other civilizations, to enter other galaxies, to spread our species accross the universe. There's also the chance that before that, we annihilate ourselves in the next 500 years, but I like to believe otherwise. Maybe I'm just a fool, or naive, but maybe this isn't so crazy after all.   BECAUSE IT WAS A COMMENT IN THE FORM OF TEXT   Ese es el espritu   It sure did, thanks!   An outside observer would never witness you cross the horizon, as you approached, you'd slow down and any light emitted would redshift to zero  How long would this take?    We would never see something going into a black hole, right? It would take infinite time from our perspective to see say a planet or a star get sucked it, because of time dilation. So, how is it that we observe they grow?    What if we 'faked' gravity using centrifugal force?    Most likely not a great glass. Amazing shot nonetheless!

Aparently no, or someone did and thought it was funny and said nothing. Of course the media did and it was all over the news the day after.  The best part was that they kept running it. I searched it but couldn't find it, I don't remember which province was it. If I find it I'll post it here.  EDIT: HA! Found it. 00:19 is where it's at.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2Nrcd0Czu4   Sometimes I go on a porn adventure, opening related videos and I end up watching some amateur booty going up and down and up and down and that video is named something like 1912894pk_9845912_mwv in a pornsite which I've never fucking heard of but it's cool because I'm now stroking myself blind and then I cum and play League of Legends a while or cook something, but then if I want to watch it again because it's been a hard week or some shit like that I go to my history and there it is, it's cool.   The suspense is killing me   Tagged as "fucked by /u/Hi-lo"   In my country a few years ago a province spot came on, telling about how we've improved our connections and technologies since the last goverment and such, and in a moment a dude is typing the website of that province, and for a split second it shows "www.xvideos.com".

Make sure you post the result :)  Look, I just snapped this upvote with my 10mm lens inverted. It's really fun to make macros with this technique: http://i.imgur.com/46bocpu.jpg   Yes! 35mm is a great focal lenght for achieving this. Make sure you open the diaphragm a bit (not fully open). You can do this by sliding to the sides a little metal piece in the back of the lens, which controls the aperture.   This is a Nikon 50mm f/1.8 lens inverted on a Nikon D90.   Inverting lenses that are in the range of normal-wide gives you an incredible amplification and you can get really good macros with it. The 18-55mm and the 18-105mm that come as a kit in basic reflex are great for doing this, at 18mm you get CRAZY magnification.    Haha, indeed it does. Thanks!   The guy's just saying her that he wants more, because it hurts having her only as a bootycall (or sorts). That fucking bitch posts this man's pain on Facebook and laughs at it, what the fuck?

EDIT: I had to edit because right when I was writing this post, my uncle who's a FBI agent entered my house and we had to evacuate because the president Obama was coming to hide (he needed a special place and my house was built with a paint coating that resists even nuclear explosions), and this whole thing made me spell a word wrong, but I can't discuss anything else with you guys, I'm on a plane as we speak on my way to a secret bunker.

I may get downvoted because of this comment (I'm stating no opinion or contributing discusable material on the subject) but I just sincerily felt my upvote wouldn't cut it, and felt the need to put it in words.    I drink beer often, and smoke weed even more regulary. I think it's most because spilling weed feels worst than spilling beer, because of what "it represents" (in terms that weed is more expensive and more difficult to get because of its legal status than beer).  Also, and I'm not saying you're stating this (other comments above are), I don't see why saying you do drugs is a synonim of looking for attention. They're forbidden, yes, but at what point? Beer and marijuana are among the easiest accesible drugs for everyone. The social judgement of them has changed so much that doing them isn't seen as rebellion anymore (weed may be a little more arguable at this point though). I don't think stating that you smoke weed is looking for attention. Sure, lots of teenagers and stupid adults do, but I think they're a minority among drug users.    Wow, that's incredible. Totally going to try that at home!  	105
 Wait closer to the date, you don't want to organise a date based meeting and have alot of time inbetween, 2 nights max    Well not really, she is a very smart, kind, quite science/law uni student, and too be honest very new too dating, she has never had a boyfriend isint one too hook up at clubs virgin but still she is a lovely lady.

 Heck, I would skip the work from selling the costumes and just keep on making gold and other important resources that I can then sell.    Okay, who put the Flintstones into anime?   Thing is, it is a gigantic series of shows if you decide to delve into the "Nasuverse".   Here is /r/anime's guide on how to get into the Fate series: http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/wiki/seriesfaq-fate   A few things of note:  * You may want to fix your typos * Try to keep titles consistent * Remove the unnecessary capitalization    A bit of a personal thing, but I cannot see Nogizaka Haruka no Himitsu Season 2 being better than Toradora. Heck, the characters were worse than the first season.     I hope this does well, this seems to be a shounen take on Marvel/DC comics which is really interesting.    Shouldn't the free space move down one?   Other than some OEL stuff and some light novels, the first volume of manga that I bought was Volume 1 of Nisekoi while I was in Japan. (If manga were that cheap here, I would buy a lot more of it. It was ~$4 USD instead of the $10 it would be in English)  I know why it is more in the US, but I can still gripe about it. (Licensing it, translation, redrawing, cover design changes if needed, printing, advertising, shipping, etc)    I thought it was centimeters. (As such 15 cm is about 6 inches, which is the length of a dollar bill)   For those of you wondering [this is one of the frames](http://i.imgur.com/guof8lv.jpg) that shows what they are asking about.  It almost looks like Emiya's "Trace On" ability that was shown when repairing the heater and also when strengthening the poster when he was defending against Lancer.   Did anyone else see [this?!?!?!](http://i.imgur.com/guof8lv.jpg) During the part where Archer is preparing his sword/arrow/drill there was a series of ~6-8 frames where it flashes Emiya's "Trace On" but it has Archer's hand/arm behind it.   I stepped through the frames and this is the clearest one that has them both in it.  NOTE: I haven't played UBW, so I have no idea if this is of major importance.   Berser-car reminds me of Bowser Jr. from Super Smash Bros 4 with the small wheels, car with a face and cannon out the mouth.   The cigarettes would become lollipops with smoke coming out of them.   It is a light novel series in which each chapter is important to the story that they couldn't skip much, if any, of it. So far, there are 216 chapters out, 214 have been translated. To give the series its full worth, it would have to be a good number of episodes. (100 may be stretching it, but I would see 50+)   The story also comprises the life of Rudeus starting from his infancy.   Not only that but some of the content would make it difficult to adapt.   Without compression, this is how it would turn out: The resolution would be 1280x720 so 345600 pixels. Since every color can be expressed by a 0-255 integer and there are three colors that comprise one pixel there are a total of 1036800 integers at a time. Considering that they can use an integer that only takes 8 bits of data (2^8 -1, which is 0-255) this means that a single frame takes up 1.037 MB. At thirty frames a second it would be 31.11 MB/s.  Now, this is why people have developed compression for video as you do not need to send every frame but only the pixels that have changed.   --- For a true idea of the amount of data that it would take: According to [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/vita/comments/1r6fz4/ps4ps_vita_remote_plays_uses_2030mbs_per_minute/) post on /r/vita the PS4-PS Vita uses ~20-30 MB per minute. (So anywhere from 0.33-0.5 MB/s) Odds are the PS4-PS4 uses the same idea and code as the PS4-Vita remote play so this should be about right.  EDIT: Removed trailing parenthesis and elaborated on the last sentence of the "Without compression" part.   The Clannad OST, along with Key's other works, is on the US iTunes right now. Key/VisualArts seems to be releasing all of their soundtracks and albums internationally.   There is also episode 3.   Bubblews is a mixed bag. Some love it while others claim it is just a big scam and if there is anything suspicious with your account, even if it isn't your fault, they will not pay you.  As for the foreign thing, I have no idea.   Nope. It was the first of their "Kinetic Novel" line, but it was not their first work. (Planetarian came out in 2006, while Clannad was out in 2004 and Kanon/Air even sooner.)   Huh, while I bought it used it seemed as though it was barely opened. Where you got yours from might have been a reprint or thrown away.   A little context for this, I found this slip within the booklet in the copy of the Clannad Soundtrack that I managed to find while I was in Japan. It seems to be announcing Key's "new" works such as Planetarian along with advertising their "current" games such as Air, Kanon, and Clannad.       Yeah, but that is only two seasons worth of episodes. (1 on, 1 off, 1 on)   It is where a series of two, or more, cour length is split over multiple seasons alternating whether it is airing or not.  Most of the time it just airs for a total of two seasons, but for the first time there is a series that is going to do split cour for a total of three seasons' worth of episode. (It will take five seasons to complete) It is the new Durarara anime that is doing this.    Shh, that never happened. It was never adapted until 2006.   Two seasons. (Each season is ~11-13 episodes long so this one will go for 22-26 episodes)   My guess is that we will know in due time.    I think OP is looking for an anime where the MC chooses everyone. (Not the sort of unknown end either)      For those of you wondering why I posted this, I decided to compare the fan translation/scan to the actual published volume to look for differences.  I found a few others but those are mainly details and the fan translation/scan cut a little bit off the top and bottom of the image.   That dang cat getting in on busting on Suzuki's well, uh, bust.   Do you have access to a black/whiteboard? One of the games that the anime club at my university plays is something along the lines of pictionary where you have one person draw something from a show and people have to guess where it is from or what character it is.  You'd have to have someone, who is running it, that pulls aside the person before they start drawing and ask them who/what they are going to draw so that when people guess you can judge whether it is right or wrong.  It is pretty fun and it can go for any length of time, but thirty minutes would be more than enough.   Rather than waiting for the third season that will never come, how about reading the light novels? They are available in English up to volume 11 or 12 out of 17 total volumes.   The first season covers 1 and 2 and the second season covers 3 and 5. (They skipped volume 4)   They were ~$750 USD at the time those posts went up in Japan.   Would it account for all 300,000 sales? No, but evidence from past shows such as *K-ON!* where [people were going out and buying the $700 USD equivalent headphones that the characters used to the point that they sold out in the stores that sell them](http://myanimelist.net/forum/?topicid=84543) lends some credence to that possibility.  The link goes to a forum post, but they gave and linked their sources enough that it is reputable.   Odds are, this is what increased sales of the game in Japan due to fans of the show going out and buying the game that the character is playing.   Heck, they even had the day theme from the game playing during the episode!   Most fansub groups have an IRC channel with a number of XDCC bots for people to use. So yeah, they are still around.   This is just /a/ pulling crap. I've read the manga up to the point that has been translated and none of this happens.   Heck, other than the second point, those cannot happen as it is a "shounen" manga which is geared towards boys 12-19-ish...   Please remember to flair your post!

In your case, you should use the "Requests" flair as you are asking for suggestions.   The one thing I really like about the recent posts by /u/Shadoxfix's bot, which uses his account, is that he includes the link to where you can legally watch it.   I think there was something wrong with the bot so I copied the source from the episode 2 post, added the link to the second episode discussion and submitted it.   It is on Funimation. (You need their subscription to see the third episode but you can watch the first and second ones for free)   There are *other* methods out there, but you are on your own.   **MyAnimeList:** [Shingeki no Bahamut: Genesis](http://myanimelist.net/anime/21843/Shingeki_no_Bahamut:_Genesis)   **FUNimation:** [Rage of Bahamut: Genesis](http://www.funimation.com/shows/rage-of-bahamut-genesis)  ---  **Previous episodes:**  |**Episode**|**Reddit Link**| |:--|:--|:-- |Episode 1|[Link](http://redd.it/2id1pc)| |Episode 2|[Link](http://redd.it/2j4f2e)|   Better yet, when/if the kickstarter meets or exceeds its goal in November, the game will be released in English! (Sekai Project is even trying to get it on Steam but that one would be the all ages version. No idea how it is going to be all-ages without some of the scenes, but Frontwing [the developer] has a Vita version out which is all-ages.)  [Here is some more information about the Kickstarter right from Sekai Project.](http://prefundia.com/projects/view/lets-bring-the-grisaia-trilogy-to-the-west/2814/)    It was complicated when it happened, but I would ask for you to search "truecrypt unsafe" for yourself to get an idea of what happened.   **WARNING:** TrueCrypt is not safe! There has been a lot of discussion over the months that hints that the developers of TrueCrpyt were coerced by government(s) into lessening the security of the software.    My university's anime club is crap. A lot of issues and drama that shouldn't be there is there so I don't bother going.   I have found a number of people who watch anime and such that are pretty cool to hang out with so I do that.  My parents know about anime and such, but I have no idea what they think of it. They also know I have a few figures, but those were ones that I got while in Japan. My Mom likes the figures and thinks they are cool, but I have no idea what my father thinks. (I have a [Saber](http://myfigurecollection.net/item/111864), [Nadeko](http://myfigurecollection.net/item/175534) and a [Saber Lily nendoroid.](http://myfigurecollection.net/item/6581))   Nathan Anderson  It says so on the bottom right of the image.   Something something doujinshi.   Something something /r/tsunderesharks   [Here](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/wiki/seriesfaq-fate) is /r/anime's FAQ/"How to get into the Fate series" wiki page. I think it is fairly clear but it depends on how far down the rabbit hole you want to go.  The Fate series is part of a larger universe which is colloquially known as the "Nasuverse". From a rough estimate, there is about ~15-20 full days worth of content. (360-480 hours!!!)   [Here](http://js-fireworks.appspot.com/svg/index.html) is where they got the code that they had scrolling in the background. It is a webGL experiment to launch fireworks and show a message on the screen.  EDIT: Right click and select "View Source" to see it.   It happens quite often in anime where a female voice actress will voice a male, but seemingly female, character. (Hayate from *Hayate no Gotoku* comes to mind.)   This is the first time that I have ever heard Hebrew used in an anime.  Elohim means "God" and is used in the Bible to refer to God.  I can't find much about "Essaim" though...   Sensei and Ninomiya-kun from Minami-ke.    Yeah, I was doing mTurk before I even had a job. The surveys are, mainly, just giving your opinion and the tasks, if they are made right, give you more than enough instructions to do it.   I'd suggest going to mTurk Forum (A third party forum) and using their daily recommended hits thread to find some of the better ones.   **Please do not mention illegal streaming/downloading sites.**     **Please do not mention illegal streaming/downloading apps.**   **Please do not mention illegal streaming/downloading apps.**   **Please do not mention illegal streaming/downloading sites.**   **Please do not mention illegal streaming/downloading sites.**   **Please do not mention illegal streaming/downloading sites.**   **Please do not mention illegal streaming/downloading sites.**   **Please do not mention illegal streaming/downloading sites.**   **Please do not mention illegal streaming/downloading sites.**   **Please do not mention illegal streaming/downloading sites.**   **Please do not mention illegal streaming/downloading sites.**   **This is your friendly** ~~warning~~ **reminder to not post links or mention illegal sites.**  It is fine if you say that you torrent stuff, but mentioning/linking specific sites is not allowed.

(Some of which people may or may not have seen)     Then why does the ibuprofen bottle that I have list it as a fever reducer? http://i.imgur.com/XJmB0T9.jpg   Try using mTurk. (US Only) Unlike many of the other beermoney sites, this one always has work for people to do. It is run by Amazon, but they do not (at least that I have seen) post work themselves. People, mainly researchers, post tasks/surveys/jobs/things for people to do in return for money. I've made ~$900 over three years off and on doing odd jobs.   Here we go again...   Even when she visited the university that I went to last year there were really high contentions. She had to have bodyguards and such. One thing, that I do not like about her is that she had someone pre-screen all of the questions from students even thought it was written in the contract that the Q A would be open. (Heck, she didn't even want a Q A session.)   She talks about being a journalist but yet she does not follow the conventions of not censoring (ie. Pre-screening) speech...   As for the "feminist" side she wasn't the stereotypical nutty feminist that people make her out to be. Yeah, she tends to pick the major and blatant examples that fits her arguments but she presents them in a logical manner.   If anyone is wondering what it is, I guess it is the max character size in smiley faces. (2048)    Not only is it a Steinway it is, most likely, a model D (9-ft grand piano used, mainly, in concert halls and it costs about $150,000 USD). They even got the internals from the main brass "Chassis" to the shape/color of the hammers to even the piano stool that they use. I think they even used a Steinway when producing the music as it sounds the same as the Steinways that I have heard.  Source: I see and hear a model D every single day and it always has its lid up, during the day. (All Steinway School) Sadly the thing is normally playing itself... :(  **EDIT**: Here are some pictures I quickly took of it: http://i.imgur.com/R4ccafU.jpg  http://i.imgur.com/S1vbfEu.jpg  http://i.imgur.com/FLW5tLK.jpg (The reason for the power cord is to power the player piano.)  http://i.imgur.com/2SAcJi6.jpg  http://i.imgur.com/EZ7vx1O.jpg   I hope they fall into usual patterns...   .   Otherwise they'd be stepping on each other's feet while dancing.   Don't be surprised to see Nozaki's counts go down. According to an earlier post the first volume of the anime included an event ticket which really jumps up the sales.   Even so, I hope this means that they will make a second (or even a third) season.   Yeah, all of the Viz Media ones had to be removed by the developer. (There is a way around the block but involves installing a VPN and having your location set somewhere other than the US. Ironically, Japan works.)   Manga Rock is the one I use. It has access to a lot of different sites including batoto. (You can even search multiple sources at once!)   It is stated in the book that one alsin is about one meter.   The other measurement that is unique to this series is the "koku" which is two hours. (ie. Half-koku is an hour)   "Friend maker"   While I am not a violinist, I think they even got the violin down with the correct finger placements and movement. (According to the PVs that are out.)   I guess we'll have to wait until episode 2 to see the violin though.   While they aren't all Nintendo characters, there are figure shops in Japan. (Mainly around Akihabara and Nakano Broadway, but I image that there would be more around the country.)   While I am a mod here, I am talking as myself.  My thoughts are that you ought to make this as a "Request" thread but put the same rules and such in that post.   My concern is that if we have this weekly, people will begin suggesting the same shows over and over until they get popular enough to break the qualifications.   You may want to message the mods with the suggestion for a routine stickied post much like our current weekly suggestion threads. (I'd do it myself, but you are the one who has the idea and may be able to word it better than someone interpreting your post.)   No problem! I saw your question about it towards the mods and I double checked the rules and saw that was there. (I guess this way people can say "Hey, I like A:TLAB, what would be a good anime to watch?" and vice-versa.)   [Isekai no Seikishi Monogatari](http://myanimelist.net/anime/5781/Isekai_no_Seikishi_Monogatari) - Pretty much fits your request to the letter. It is a spin-off of Tenchi Muyo but you don't have to know anything about that series to watch this one.   For some clarification, your recommendation of "The Legend of Korra" is allowed here since "Anime-inspired shows/films" is listed under accepted media.   Your link was automatically removed by AutoModerator.  Please change your link from an illegal manga site to something like MAL or Hummingbird where you can read the plot summary.   I am *shocked* that no one has mentioned the instruments in this episode!  They did an AMAZING job showing the instruments and the action of the keys, hammers and what not.  The Steinway   Sons piano is accurate down to the number of holes in the support, the model of the piano bench and everything else. (Source: I attend an all-Steinway university so I have seen them up close and even played them a bit. I am no where proficient with the piano but I have taken a little bit of lessons before.)  The keys that were played, throughout the episode, were accurate which really showed during the melodica scene during the trill around 17:07 is where I really noticed it.   Good enough that Guillermo del Toro is trying to get HBO to adapt it into a full series. (HBO is the same channel that is airing Game of Thrones)   Source: http://www.crunchyroll.com/anime-news/2014/08/14/guillermo-del-toro-mentions-monster-adaptation-in-sugoi-japan-endorsement   Yeah, people got so many cards that they were able to guess the numbers even though they hadn't won them which is why your wins were empty.   Nope, the first episode was delayed until this week's monday. It will then return to its normal airing time. (Every Thursday)   Whoops, I meant to say for them to search for episode 1...   So far, there aren't any official sources for watching this show. To answer your question would be to break the rules. Try google searching for episode one since it is "out" and subbed somewhere.  Hint: Watch for /u/Shadowfix 's bot to post the discussion thread for it. It also looks the sites that people put fansubs on.   I wish they hadn't revealed that the red-haired girl was someone working with "Shepherd" in episode 1. I haven't read the source, as it isn't translated, but it seemed to be giving the viewer too much right off the bat.   I guess, now the question isn't of who but why and how they are doing what they are doing.  I'll stick with this one as it seems as though it is a light-hearted series. Also, the VN is made by August who made "Brighter than the Dawning Blue" and "Fortune Arterial". (They've made others, but those two have been adapted into anime.)   There is "Osu!" which is a free music/rhythm game that can be played with only the mouse. There are thousands of charts/maps that are out there for you to play and there is even multiplayer.   That is why I said most of their shows are. Nichijou was only licensed in Australia.   Just because it isn't being simulcasted doesn't mean that it won't make it to the US. Odds are someone will license it considering most of KyoAni's works have been. (Except for Nichijou)   The CG is better in S2.   I think they did it like that because the MC is in the same situation. You learn of the world and what is going on as the MC does.   It got delayed due to a volleyball game going longer than anticipated. It was pushed to Monday. The second episode will air on Thursday at its normal time.   Heads up, no official source. Head to the high seas.   You need a flair on your post.

(Each win gave you $6 and they repeated it as much as they could.)  M Ms then only gave credit towards your cable bill... :(   Well, it is always the right moon if you *type* it out.   I wouldn't be surprised if that is where they got their inspiration from.   Welcome to the western world. They don't allow adult (AKA AO rated) content on Steam. This also goes for brick and mortar stores such as Wal Mart, Target, Best Buy, etc...   It may still have NSFW, but not the H, scenes in it. Sekai contacted Steam and they have worked out a way to possibly have those scenes.   I would suggest waiting until the game comes out on Steam. Yes, the VN (the all ages version) will be coming out on Steam in English. (Sekai Project has the rights to release it)   Even so, it is unmarked.   **WARNING:** The "Here is the original for the Amane bedroom scene is **NSFW!!!***   Out of context scene that is funny.

More info on flairs used in this subreddit can be found [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Animesuggest/wiki/index#wiki_which_flair_should_i_use.3F)   There isn't anything inside the windows. It is just a gradient from the bottom right to the upper part of the middle.   Thing is, the writing quality of the translation is pretty good. It is a lot better than you think it is. (At least up through volume 5, which is where I am at.) There is a lot of intrigue and characterization that occurs and it is pretty good all things considered.   I would suggest reading the light novels. You can find them on the usual site. (It says "preview" but it is the full book.)   The LNs are a lot better than what the anime is making it out to be. While the fan service scenes are there they are fairly short and only really happen once or twice a volume. (224 pages or so.) They are also brought up again later so they serve an actual purpose.   It definitely has a big budget. The big (ie. Little) things I noticed:  * Finger positions and movement while playing the violin * The action of the piano * The "Steinway   Sons" licensing, which I imagine would not be cheap * Animation quality * Sound/OST quality was really really good even though it was hosted on YouTube...    Heck, Madoka was only 1 cour and you see how well that was written/done.   [Gate: Thus the JSDF Fought There](http://myanimelist.net/manga/41733/Gate:_Jieitai_Kanochi_nite_Kaku_Tatakeri) which applies a similar idea as Outbreak Company but with the JSDF (Japanese Self Defense Force), which is basically Japan's military.   **WARNING**: Some of the scenes are gruesome and may contain full frontal nudity. It is still a great read and it is released monthly.   Even better is that you can easily buy the soundtrack through iTunes.   Shouldn't it be:  Counteraction:   [X] Rising     [ ] Falling     Thank you for reminding people to use the correct flair. I've changed it for OP.   It isn't that we are getting lazy, it is moreso the fact that college has started back up and we are busy.

 Grammy wasn't dead just yet. Grammy was just curious to see what her own granddaughter would do once she died. As you can see in the photo she was quite shocked. Grammy wished she knocked some goddamn sense into her granddaughter. #duckface     The music being played in the video doesn't quite set the mood... But hell, just an opinion.   I kinda feel bad by saying this but... should have pinched yourself before doing that bro... I'm sorry for you bro... really, really sorry. :[   This right here... This right here was a good read.

          Sachiel gets the week of prep that Shinji and Asuka got.       Let's see if I can keep it going for the rest of 2015      A milk jug has been poured out and filled again, but this time with everyone's favorite time-travelling liquid metal (don't worry, that includes the main processor). Who can it beat? Who can beat it?   Bonus: Who could beat [3.033*10^8 T-1000s combined into one?](http://www.reddit.com/r/theydidthemath/comments/2qvxg4/request_if_several_t1000s_terminator_2_could_melt/cnagnh0)      Legendary's new Godzilla to be specific   Would they be able to effectively come together to form a single unified being or would they be too separate?      Why does this exist? Eating tiny food to restore a percent or two at a time to get to 0% WITHIN TWO MINUTES. WHILE AN ORGY OF DEDEDES ARE CONSTANTLY UNDOING MY PROGRESS. ON THE BIGGEST STAGE IN THE GAME. I mean, for fucks sake make the good bigger or something do I can fucking SEE it. And all the stage hazards can OHKO you if god decides you haven't suffered enough. Fuck you, whoever made this event.   I've owned this game for over a year now and I still have no god damned clue how Caravan is played.    That shit is so cash I need it on my body.    The fight takes place in Daten City. Everyone gets six hours of prep time.   Bonus: all three of them vs. Evangelion's angels         Alternatively, A Miracle on Elm Street      Also, is he technically a magical girl a la Sailor Moon?      I swear to God there is a method to my madness   In the theatrical cut if Army of Darkness, Ash returns to his time and saves the day from a Deadite at S-Mart. In the Director's Cut ending, we see he sleeps a century too long. The assumption is that this is the effect of a Third World War while he was asleep. But what if it was the result of the return of the Deadites during the extra century? He isn't awake to stop the Deadite at S-Mart, so that Deadite was able to take over the world starting from there.       The year is 2014. the King of Kings has gotten fed up with jolly old Saint Nick hogging the spotlight on the celebration of *His* birth. So, he challenges him to a competition. If Jesus wins, he gets Christmas. If Santa wins, Jesus backs down as humanity's messiah and God's right hand.   RULES: Unless specified, Jesus doesn't get to use any feats from Revelation. He is out of character, and willing to fight rather than just pacify the situation. Santa gets his feats from all depictions **of him**. That is to say, Saint Nicholas gets feats from his various depictions. Other Santas, like Arthur Christmas, Futurama's Santa, the Grinch, Odin, and Tim Allen, **all don't count toward Santa's feats**. As long as it's Nick himself, everything else is fair game.   Round 1: Standard bout. Post-Crucifixion Jesus Christ (PCJC). Takes place in Jerusalem. Santa gets two days of prep, no weapons.   Round 2: They switch jobs. Jesus has to deliver all the presents, Santa has rule over the world for a night. Whoever does the other's job better wins.   Round 3: Jesus' Super Smash Bros game of choice. Both will be using gamecube controllers (because let's be real it isn't the N64 game). Santa gets a month of training with the top competitive Smash players.   Round 4: Swimsuit competition.   Round 5: They are both tasked with converting an extremely cynical, closed-minded atheist to believing in them. Whoever can make him believe first without pulling anything supernatural wins.                         World War III has been initiated by the Illuminati and now the POTUS is the mot stereotypical American possible: fat, gun-loving, communazi-hating, overly consumerist, favorite movie is probably Saving Private Ryan or something, you know who I'm talking about. The rest of the planet is either ruled by the Fourth Reich or the Communist Empire (I'm creative, I know). Siding with either is a guaranteed victory with the same spoils for America, choosing to side with neither is guaranteed destruction.   EDIT: BONUS ROUND: There is a fourth army in this war, led by Magneto. His army is significantly smaller and the same strength as the Commies and Nazis. Again, the only change in this is who is helping America, they will still win no matter who they choose.    DMX has challenged the X-Men in the most honorable of battles: a rap battle. The X-men must choose their greatest battle rapper to accept the challenge. They both get a week of prep. The X-Men aren't allowed to manipulate DMX's rapping. Who is the best rapper in the mutant world? Can they win, or is X Gonna Give it to Them?   What if the x.xx titles aren't meant to be pronounced "one point one one" or "one point eleven" (apply as needed to sequels). Maybe the titles are meant to be irrational numbers, like x/9. They would be pronouced x.x *repeating*. Maybe it;s nothing, but I thought it was neat.             I want to main Sailor Moon, but at the same time I don't want to pour all my time into Mii Fighter only to find out that I can't play competitively.    So John Connor (as he appears in Judgement Day) is drafted by NERV to pilot their newest Eva model, the E-800. Obviously, we know where Sarah is in this situation. Because Third Impact has been avoided in this continuity, NERV now blows their government funding on giant robot fights for sport. These fights have pilots get in their Evas, but then the Evas are forced to go berserk because... reasons. The berserk mama bears fight in an arena setting. How does Sarah Connor fare against...  1) Eva-00  2) Eva-02  3) The MP-Eva series  4) The Angels (yeah, we cloned the Angels back to life. What are you gonna do?  4) Eva-01  All Evas are, of course, berserk.   TL;DR Who has the best mom in all of Evangelion and/or Terminator?   He experiences the game as the player would, save for one thing. He carries a chainsaw out of Vault 101 with him. When Amata closes the vault door, he attempts to get back in but ends up getting his hand stuck in the door. He has to cut it off and attach the chainsaw to the stump. Now he's on his own in the Wastes.   Victory conditions:   Create his own army and dominate the wasteland.   Complete the entire game, DLC included  Become known from DC to New Vegas   One time this werewolf motherfucker came into this apple store and started playing the default ringtone on his iPhone so everyone would have to check their phones. Not only that, but he downloaded terabytes of foot fetish porn onto the laptops. So subtle, that sneaky sneaky wolf. And the worst part? It was all legal.       1: Freestyle rapping  2: general rhyming  3: texting  4: Creating chaos  5: coining catchphrases  6: horrifying obsession over a coworker  7: a battle of pure coyness. Coyest diva left standing wins.       The Inner Senshi as they appear at the end of the original 90s anime (that is to say Sailor Moon, not Sailor Moon R). Kaworu is his Manga/TV incarnation, not Mr. Yaoi-no-Powers from 3.33. Fight takes place in the abandoned city of Tokyo-3. Everyone is in character.       Gamzilla uses the collective feats of both.             I can't tell if it's the most commie shit or the most patriotic shit I've ever heard.   He said he wished he weren't form the USA, so he could experience America for the very first time.  I'm still really unsure about this one.    Kaworu is revealed as the final angel and NERV decides not to deploy Unit-01. Instead, they send in their newest ally- the Silver Surfer. Who wins? Does humanity come out of this in multiple pieces? Both are in-character, and let's use Manga Kaworu because he's the coolest.    Your top 5 (try to keep them human-scale, with a maximum of like 10 feet) characters go to an abandoned cabin in the woods. They read from the Necronomicon and summon some Candarian demons. Who gets possessed first, will the others survive or will they all be Dead by Dawn?  BONUS: The last survivor gets dragged into the third movie. Will they protect the Necronomicon from the deadites?                                 From [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/GODZILLA/comments/2mowgl/finally_found_bc_godzilla_2014/) post on /r/Godzilla.  This team includes 4 T-800s with varying levels of damage and 2 Legendary Godzillas. Who can they beat? Who can beat them?      Three-way Battle of the Bands. They're only allowed to use their feats from these songs.                      Like, how many of you will actually talk about Lord Arceus when religion comes up in conversation? Do you answer "Arceist" to the question of religion?       Assume the kaiju aren't going to act like assholes while off duty. They have to defend the crucified Lilith from the angels in the same manner as the original anime, starting with Sachiel. NERV will find the Lance of Longinus at the same time that they originally did. They also get to use the A.T. Field things that Unit-13 had in 3.33.   **If the team gets angelstomped too hard, they can start again with these modifications.   Godzilla is the version from Final Wars. **Also gets Spacegodzilla  Mothra is also her FW incarnation. **Mothra Leo with all his BS tranformations  Rodan is Fire Rodan because regular Rodan sucks. **Also gets Megaguirus.   King Ghidorah is his GvKG incarnation, and if he ever dies he can be rebuilt as Mecha King Ghidorah. **Replaced by Desghidorah,   Mechagodzilla is Kiryu from Tokyo SOS. **Kiryu and MOGUERA (from Spacegodzilla)  EDIT: Also when Tabris does arrive instead of seducing Shinji he seduces Minya.    We all know the A.T. Field is a total Deus Ex Machina in these types of battles, so here are the rules:  No removing the A.T. Field with magic or other A.T fields/Anti-A.T. fields.   No reality warping (we promise Unit-01 won't go all Third Impact)  Eva-01 is post-Zeruel (has an S^2 engine) and berserk.   No mind controlling Unit-01.                The combined cast of: Godzilla (all of them in their most recent film incarnations) and Pacific Rim, plus Clove, Clifford the Big Red Dog, several explicitly named Pokemon, and Gamera are put onto one island arena. No one is allowed to leave (think Destroy all Monsters). This is where your fave comes in. They are parachuted into the middle of the island with nothing but their usual gear and a GPS showing where any given kaiju is located. Can your favorite character kill every kaiju on the island?   Kaiju list:  Godzilla: Godzilla, Mothra, King Ghidorah, Rodan, Gigan, Mechagodzilla (70s), both MUTOs, Zilla, Orga, Baragon, Varan, Biollante, Destoroyah, Spacegodzilla, Hedorah, and Minya.   Pacific Rim: Onibaba, Knifehead, Yamarashi, Mutavore, Leatherback, Otachi, Raiju, Scunner, Slattern   Pokemon: Groudon, Kyogre, Rayquaza, Ho-Oh, Lugia, Articuno, Zapdos, Moltres  BONUS: They get to call in one Mass Production Evangelion for help, BUT all the kaiju will bum-rush them.    All of these fighters can be argued as messiah figures after J-Dawg's own image.   This is post-crucifixion Jesus  1: Gordon Freeman. All weapons allowed. (He's beloved, bearded, messianic supersoldier)  2: The Terminator 2 T-800 (Half man, stuggles between being objectively superior to humans and also being a human. Saves the world from its own hubris. Pretty much applies from here on out)  3: Kaworu Nagisa, Evangelion  4: Eva Unit-01, Shinji piloting  5: Eva Unit-01, berserk  6: Post-Crisis Superman  7: Superman Prime 1M  And any others you think should be on the list.          If you've got a loser and a Jew well deserving of a Sunday blast, write about that diva roach here. AKA!         The fight takes place in Tokyo on a full moon. They both get a month of prep time.    Is that robosexuality, even though she's an angel with a human's soul inside the robot?                     Specifically Unit-06 from End of Eva I guess.   Bonus: all the EVEs on the ship vs one Eva         This one kind of operates on the assumption that Time Loop Theory is true, but realistically we all know it is. Especially Anno.   Mari is the backup pilot for Unit-02, when it's made clear in NGE (and *heavily* implied in Rebuild) that Eva pilots can only do so because the soul inside the Eva is their mother, which allows for them to synch properly. Asuka is the designated pilot of Unit-02, because the soul of Kyoko is inside it (her?). When Asuka is out of commission following Unit-03's activation and possesion by Bardiel, Mari takes over as pilot of 02. But she shouldn't be able to, because no one named Illustrious is the soul of 02. Not only should she not be able to pilot it, but she unlocked its ability to transform (which Asuka later ended up using). If Rebuild is truly post-EoE, Kyoko could have brought herself back from the sea of LCL as her perfect self (look how similar [they](http://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/6/122523.jpg) [are](http://media.animevice.com/uploads/0/4479/384373-makinami_mari_illustrious74_large.jpg)) in order to continue protecting the next Asuka. This Asuka, however, was not her equivalent's child, due to the fact that the original was still around. This Asuka belonged to someone with the name of Shikinami. That person was presumably another scientist at Gehirn (potentially even the doctor that original Asuka's dad hooked up with when Kyoko was in the hospital) who then became new Unit-02. This would explain the redesign and upgrade. As a soul formerly known as an Eva, she is also able to pilot Unit-05 and Mark.08.                   I just got finished rewatching 3.33 to try and figure out why I don't like it. Maybe this has something to do with me not having seen any Eva for a month or so, but I found myself actually enjoying it more the second time around. So what *did* go wrong? What went right? Should it be considered as bad as some consider it?  Well for starters, about half of the movie is exposition or setup with no real answers. You have the opening, AKA "Get out of the fucking robot, Shinji". Then you have Shinji trying to make nice with "Rei", then the only character development in this movie (which to be fair is quite good at making you care for both Kaworu and Shinji), then "We reveal what everyone already figured out halfway through 2.22 even if you didn't see the original" with Fuyutsuki, then  "Get in the fucking robot, Shinji" from Kaworu, Kaworu explains what *Totally* happened during "Near"-Third Impact (seriously we saw you impale him with the Cassius what the hell), then Kaworu says some cryptic shit interlaced with the fight against WILLE and then the movie ends. This movie fails in a few regards because of this: NGE had very little explanation, leaving most exposition up to a few cryptic conversations where much is spoken but not much is said. This leaves the viewer to come up with their own conclusions as to what was going on in EoE, or what SEELE's motivations were. These questions make sure NGE stays in the viewer's mind, making it one of the most memorable stories in all of history. 3.33 tries to repeat this, but where it falls short is that most of the questions it leaves have only one logical answer. "What is the Vessel of Adams?" it makes the viewer wonder, then they think and say "Oh, wait, it probably has something to do with the Angels and Instrumentality. Rei-ish is probably like Kaworu with boobs and a bowl cut". NGE had questions with *really* ambiguous answers that are so open-ended that they are still being debated to this day. 3.33 tries to be a regular movie where all your questions are answered so any unanswered questions become plot holes, but also tries to keep its artsy "leave shit up to the viewer" movie like End of Eva.   3.33 also had very little character development As a follow-up to 2.22, we already know most of these characters. We know who the main characters are (or at least are meant to be, some of the more complex characters like Asuka have had life sucked out of them in favor of being a 2D tsundere with no real character whatsoever to the point where I've started calling her Asuka-ish). But these characters have become different people to who they were 14 years prior. They either needed more development or none at all. Pick one. And then they have the balls to throw in a new character with no development whatsoever in Mari "Deus Ex" Makinami. She just shows up during action sequences to be a comic foil to Asuka-sh and fetish material to everyone else (because the original had *nothing* to say about fetishizing teenage girls in anime. DAMNIT ANNO DID YOU EVEN WATCH EVANGELION). Whereas NGE was almost entirely character with little to no exposition, occasionally broken up by giant robot action, 3.33 was the exact opposite, being no character and lots of exposition/robots.   That being said, what 3.33 does right, it does *right*. The new robots look great (they even have a 'Mark.# naming system so we don't confuse them with the Mass Production Evas). Kaworu and Shinji share some great chemistry together, some of the scenes are pretty damn atmospheric, and the hellish imagery is greatly effective, even some of the more subtle things like Shinji being the third thing they removed from Unit-01, and it's implied that what they found in there wasn't even human. There is a lot that's left to the imagination, like what else they retrieved from Unit-01, or what how Kaworu planned to use the spears. But it's held down by the fact that it's nothing but a retread of Episode 24 of the original, which tries to explain things but keeps holding itself back for that unique street cred.   So is 3.33 as bad as some people say? I actually have two answers. As a standalone movie, or even as the third movie in the Rebuild saga (independent from NGE) I'd say it's pretty good. No masterpiece, but it's a decent sequel to 2.22 and presumed prequel to 3.0+1.0. The character development does leave some things to be desired, but it does a good job of not holding your hand. The hellish imagery adds a lot to the overall quality and it's appropriately subtle in a lot of places. Rebuild is a must-watch for any fan of Mecha.   As an Evangelion movie, however, I'm gonna go ahead and say it's almost, but not quite, fucking garbage. It is the antithesis to everything Neon Genesis stands for, from its bland characters (except maybe Kaworu), to its "baby's first mindfuck" approach to Fourth Impact, to its sine-waving between Evangelion's "open to interpretation" plot and an easy to understand plot. Holding it up to the original, it's NOT subtle in any way, shape, or form. Obviously it's more subtle than Pacific Rim or Gurren Lagann, but it lacks the meta commentary, complex characters, and even the heart of NGE. The first half completely ignores the rest of Eva and effectively resets the universe, while the second half is just a drawn-out, over-the-top version of Episode 24. Rebuild (I've dropped the 'Of Evangelion' in the hopes that it might become true) has to make up for this with 3.0+1.0 if it wants any credibility. Just watch the last three episodes and you'll be good.          Does the [choral section after the guitar solo](http://youtu.be/k9zcjnEyKjc?t=1m45s) have any particular lyrics or is it just vocalization? I can't find any lyrics for them, but they are consistent throughout every single cover of the song.       Edit: for whatever *reason*. God damnit.                         Space-G has to fight every single pokemon. The fight takes place in that region's city, which Space-G has made his new fortress of solitude. Which regions can he defeat? Which regions defeat him?  Note: Especially for Gen IV, we are using whichever incarnation is most reasonable for the fight (e.g. giant Groudon. but no omnipotent Arceus)            After Gendo Ikari is "eaten" by a naked Unit-01 during Third Impact, his soul is added to Instrumentality. The world he exists in and refuses to return from after Giant Naked Rei is killed is the one that exists in Rebuild. The first is a complete retread of his memories, knowing what he knows he added some things from the real world (red seas, MP-Eva outline) he sees where he went wrong and could make a change in regards to Shinji, by adding a new person to the mix, namely Mari Ilustrious Makinami. The reason she's a Mary Sue is because she represents Gendo's paradise, not unlike Kaworu for Shinji. Speaking of gay alien Jesus, he remembers the original because he's an Angel, and therefore infiltrated Gendo's world, once again like for Shinji. In Gendo's perfect world, he kills SEELE, the only people who were stopping his Instrumentality scenario. Going back to EoE, in his final moments, Gendo regretted his treatment of Shinji and his last words were an apology to his son. So all the *slightly* not-as-shitty-but-still-mostly-shit that Shinji suffers through in Rebuild (not being able to see the Dummy System kill Bardiel, not killing Kaworu with his own hands, being a hero and getting the girl in 2.22, etc.) was a result of that.    I have a piano that I want to learn to play it on while I sing. Five seconds in Google only turned up guitar tabs and the wrong song.          [Here's the lyrics in both Japanese and English.](http://www.stlyrics.com/lyrics/neongenesisevangelion/acruelangelsthesis.htm)   Who takes the role of:  The Whore, The Athlete, The Fool, The Scholar, and the Virgin (work with what we have)  What horror do they summon? Are the old gods appeased?             I'm a singer and I want to perform a song in the name of our Lord. Is there anything I can do without knowing how to play an instrument?  It has come to my attention that the answer is no. I'll see if I can find some free time to create some vocal music.    As a gift, my mom is buying me a 760, or something in that price range. I need to know what parts I should get to match, preferably around $500.             **Name:** Amir Valerie Blumenfeld (also goes by "Vance", "DJ Schmumu", and various combinations of his name and "Jacob Hurwitz")  **Identification code:** 425862-JA-IIWY  **Biography:** This prisoner's past is inconsistent at best. As best we can gather, he was brought illegally from Canada to New York state, where his abusive parents raised him, teaching him to drive at 4. He was verbally and physically abused, and every time he was deemed a disappointment, his father moved houses. It is known that Amir was neighbors with a child named Penis Anthony Dooblinge (who recently changed his name to Roboert Cut off my own Penis Fatty Fatty Narr Narr Smoke A Bowl Full Of Sour Cream Veggie Burrito Penis) Amir was abducted from a shopping mall when he was six years of age and returned at the age of 11. He had forgotten how to speak and survived on a diet of chicken nuggets, a diet which still persists into his 30s. He repeated second grade an apparent total of 8 times, then managed to reach sixth grade without talking for four years, when he did eventually speak he was returned to second grade due o his illiteracy in math and English. It is unknown how much time passed before he got an internship at Collegehumor, where he still works, with no apparent job despite being employed. As a result of his upbringing, he seems to suffer from delusions of grandeur.   **Known crimes:** Innumerable counts of attempted murder and aggravated assault, arson, prank calls to 911, attempted robbery on a subway, libel against an airline (awaiting a ruling form the jury) lying under oath, stalking, stabbing a coworker (Jake Hurwitz), several counts of animal abuse (a snake, a kidnapped dog, several animals he brutally murdered just to wear as accessories), sexual harassment, breaking and entering (at least two counts), armed robbery, destruction of property, public nudity, stealing from sleeping homeless women, assaulting police officers, and kidnapping the child of an officer.   **Summary of capture:** A co-worker (Jake Hurwitz) alerted us about the dangerous nature of his actions and of the crimes he's committed. We waited at Jake's apartment until Amir attempted to break in, at which point we arrested him.   **Sentence:** Amir clearly suffers symptoms of schizophrenia. He is to be given a therapist to help with his mental illness. For the crimes he has committed, he is to be given a life sentence with no probation.   **Containment Notes:** Do not be fooled by Amir's weak, underweight body. He has more than enough strength to break out of a minimum security cell. He has the apparent ability to teleport, despite being a mortal human. He is to be locked in, with guards watching him at all times. Once his reeducation and rehabilitation are complete, he can be moved to a lower security and given probation.    1: a straight-up 3-way fight between them. Mothra has laid her egg and therefore can come back as two larvae if she so chooses.   2: Who would do the best doing the other two's jobs? (ie. Aquaman vs Godzilla AND Aquaman vs pollution)  3: Who could they beat together?  4: How many Hedorahs would it take to defeat them?               Baragon has apparently never won a single battle. Who's the strongest fighter he could fight in order to break his losing streak?                      I need to know what this looks like.                   The JSSDF scrapped the Jet Alone project after the episode 7 incident, and decided to instead work on a much better nuclear mecha to rival NERV's Eva-series. The JSSDF plans on raiding the Geofront using an army of Kiryus. Units 00 and 02 have been put into suspension at the time of the attack, so NERV only has Unit-01 to defend themselves. Shinji decides to stop being a bitchly and get in the fucking robot for once.   Each Kiryu has an S^2 engine so they won't run out of power, but they still can't cast an AT field  Bonus: Could Kiryu beat one Mass Production Evangelion (who have no AT fields, but do have the heavy spear)?  Bonus II: Could one Kiryu succeed where Asuka failed and take out all the MP-Evas? The power issues Kiryu has are back for this round  Bonus III: How many Kiryus would it take to kill *every* Evangelion? Rebuild units included. That's 00, 01, 02, Bardiel, 04 (who is presumably the same as unit-02), Unit-05, Mark VI, Unit-08, Unit-09, and Unit-13               [from this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNhsXnxl04w)   Cave Johnson has accidentally done a Second Impact. Now, because there is no Gehirn or SEELE in this world, Aperture Science has to be the ones to kill the Angels. They are also housing GLaDOS, who was built from Lilith now. If the Angels get to her, Third Impact will happen and GLaDOS will have failed. She has all the resources available in both Portal and the Half-Life games. Can she do it? Who does she use as a pilot I'd she figures out the Evangelion plans?  Things that now exist from Evangelion: AT fields, the Dead Sea Scrolls Apocrypha, the Lance of Longinus.  GLaDOS can also build Evangelions and the Positron Accelerator, but needs to research and invent them. She has 15 years after Second Impact until Sachiel attacks to build.         	165
 Anything that is inedible, is not really meant to be eaten or has no relation to the ingredients on the plate and which can be flicked off the plate with your thumb and finger.  Examples would be a tomato rose, a flower or a sprig of herb that is not used in the dish.    .......and they probably speak English better than some here.  Hopefully they don't learn English from some of our videos that promote slang.    WUT?!!!     I've heard that there are more people in China that can speak and write English then in America. BTW, my mom couldn't understand Chinese but she recognized their language.   lol   This was my mom's experience not mine.  I'm sure she knew how to use it but knowing her quirks she was just interested in why the instructions were so long.  Maybe there was some ancient Chinese wisdom that said one should Never Ever use Tiger Balm on specific sore places!   Mom told it better than I can.  She had a great sense of humor.    I got the impression they knew exactly what they were doing and probably had a great laugh over it later!    How do you figure that?  As far as I know he never married, hung out with 12 other guys whom he encouraged to leave their families just for him and I don't recall him saying anything about gays explicitly.     My uncle is this sloth's long lost twin brother!   Thanks!  I'm assuming I should work bottom to top and use odd numbers.   Awesome!  I'm in culinary school and my instructors wont allow us to use garnishes that are "flickable" for plating such as a tomato rose however, I'm now planning to use the strawberry rose as anyone would eat that!  Any tips?   My mother and cousin were in CA on vacation.  Mom's back was sore/stiff from driving so she bought some Tiger Balm however, all the instructions were in Chinese which she didn't understand.  She spots this elderly Chinese couple and approaches them to ask if they could read to her what the instructions said.  The elderly woman takes the instructions, looks it over and smilingly broadly says yes.  She then starts to slowly explain in Chinese what the instruction says looking up occasionally to make sure they are listening or sometimes pointing out something on the instructions and nodding her head to make sure they understood. She and her husband did this with a serious, straight face the whole time. She hands the instructions back to my Mom.  My mother politely thanks her the she and her husband walk away without saying a word.         From someone really old (meaning before cellphones, digital cameras, the Internet and accompanying social media) we had to physically meetup with our friends.  That meant actually leaving our house!  Of course it also meant, for some activities you had to travel a significant distance.   That leads me to the first thing to be cool.  A driver's license.  After that if you were really cool you may have had your own car!  Of course you couldn't show off said car without Facebook so you had to do the the next best thing which was the second coolest thing.  Cruising the lake, beach or local drag on Friday or Saturday was the standard.  Drive-ins were also acceptable but you couldn't blare your favorite cassette featuring AC/DC, Duran Duran, or Cars to name but a few.   Cheap alcohol, pot and maybe microdot were acceptable but anything harder then that, then you were considered a freak or druggie to be avoided.    I have to add this, getting knocked up or getting a girl pregnant was not seen as cool or some sort of achievement.      Your dad has some mad talent.  As someone who is familiar with koi, the markings aren't so great.  Pretty but not what koi dealers look for.  If he studied up the subject he may appeal to more koi enthusiasts. As for me, I'd love to buy a painting!   Now if only the average US female marine could do that!   and we pay no state income taxes with only a modest sales tax of 7.25%.   Winnsboro, Tx, just a tiny spot in the piney woods of east Texas   No   $235,000 or so   When I was a server, it was assumed I made 15% from the $'s that I sold and my earnings were reported as income to the IRS whether I received 15% or not.  What I didn't know then is that, as a hourly paid employee who is paid less than minimum wage as most of us are, if our tips don't combine to equal minimum wage then the employer must make up the difference.    So lets say you're on the clock as a server and no one comes into the restaurant the entire time you've been hired to provide wait-staffing duties.  You are paid $2.86 per hour to be there and you stay there the entire time but never encounter a customer.  The restaurant has to pay minimum wage, $5.75 in some states to make up for their lack of customers while you're on the clock.  This is a little known secret that most places don't want servers to know about.   If it were some of the people I worked with, they would have ripped open the front of the Shiner case and taken out bottles from the middle hoping the ones on the outside plus the cardboard would be sufficient to hold up the rest the cases.   Worked in a plant nursery where people would bring in leaves and ask why they were turning brown.  "It's fall"   My brother gave me this album for X-Mass.  Always enjoyed it and have never came across anyone who knew who they were. Thanks.   Todd Rundgren,  "Hello it's me" was for the masses but the album, "A wizard, A Star" decidedly was not and I love it to this day!   This is why everyone should know how to tell how long ago a tire was manufactured.  Rubber degenerates. Many "new" tires sold are up to two years old if not older in some unscrupulous stores.     Tootie, I'm sure that your grandma can tell you about her discovery   and clitoral ripples!   As someone that worked at a high end hotel in a major metropolis in the US I can verify that Saudi guests are the most demanding (wanting lamb at 2 am) and the most obnoxious and sexist A-holes I've ever dealt with.  I guess they suffer from Affluenza too!   I've always thought that Jimmy Carter, while handed a s**t sandwich, handled the Iran situation well.  He had the stones to refuse to negotiate with terrorists unlike Reagan who traded arms for hostages.  He may not be the most celebrated president but he is undoubtedly the most post-executive selfless serving president of all.      I'm confused, I thought the holy trinity was onions, bell peppers, and celery.   No   I think you're confusing celebration with endorsement neither of which apply to US discrimination laws concerning business practices.    If I provide a cake for a 10 year olds' birthday I'm neither celebrating nor endorsing the birthday.  I may sincerely believe that his age should include the 9 months of gestation before birth as some cultures do but that's not my place.  I sell cakes and because I choose to sell them to the public in the US I have to adhere to non-discriminationary laws.  Your examples of the photographer fail.  Unless you have the photographer give a thumbs-up in a photo or force a personal statement of endorsement of the marriage you don't have a claim of a  violation of your personal beliefs. Just photographing the event is not an endorsement.  As far as your silly comment about atheist, we absolutely don't borrow Christian morality as our world view.  We reject Christian morality with all its hypocrisy. To most atheist, Christian morality is an oxymoron.    The arrogant attitude that Christians hold themselves to concerning their monopoly on morality is laughable at best.   I'm not talking about individuals.  Many individuals from many religions are critical thinkers in their respective fields.    I'm referring to a religions capacity from their own tenets to be able to allow or even encourage critical analysis of itself.  The only religion that comes to mind that even comes close to is certain sects of Buddhism. All the other major religions from history and my experience would be perfectly happy to not have their followers be exposed to other religions or people with no religion.  More than just a few bad apples.  Do you remember reading about the Inquisition?  Are you aware of the religious freedoms denied in other countries?     I'd probably guess the later however good luck to you both!   You need the disclaimer, "Don't try this at home" or you'll have guys showing up at the hospital with super glue shoved into their dicks.    YET!   My son's astrolabe.   Although they both seek answers to basic questions concerning life they are inherently different. Philosophy is always based on critical thinking and wisdom.  Religions are not and most are actively apposed to critical analysis.   I meant he was resurrected or raised from the state of death.  So therefore, while he may have physically died for a brief time he was brought back to life.     I'm not sure about the hell and back thing.  Where does it say that he went to hell after he "died"?  Either way, since he was resurrected and then ascended into heaven what, if anything was sacrificed and if so, by whom?   The problem I have with this is Jesus ultimately did not die so there was no sacrifice.     Most likely almond tuiles.   I  imagine that after the pearl broke the bottom part of the shell would hold the sauce for dipping.   The "pearl" is probably a chocolate sauce but it can be made with many types of liquid.  The technique is called spherification using molecular gastronomy.  Basically sodium alginate is mixed with the liquid, then dropped into a calcium chloride bath by the spoon full.  This causes a "membrane" to form which holds the chocolate in a sphere shape. Cool huh?    It's not crazy at all and almost all European Christians understand this but unfortunately many American Christian theologians want the Bible to explain the history and origin of life and they will stop short of nothing to to advance their views regardless of all scientific evidence that shows the Bible is wrong on this subject     Kangaroos were in the middle east?  Is there evidence of that?   Why are you Christian?, birth or choice?   Are you kidding me?  Seriously?   For the most part no.    Paul's teaching did not come first.  Jesus's teachings did and overrode many things anything Paul proposed later.  The break came because of the lineage of Jesus's bloodline vs the apostles and their authority over the early Christians.  It was basically a power-struggle.  No big whoop here but A big whoop then!   The common disputes are over land, wealth, and political control.  The use of religion as an excuse to justify horrific methods to obtain these ends is both ancient and contemporary and is always used to appeal to common people.  Rarely has a religion grown and thrived without the support of government.  This is why some American Christians are threated and lashing out against perceived prosecutions against them.    Their dominance is quickly eroding and they know that the US Constitution does not support their former favored status.  Neither do our laws or legal agencies concerning discrimination.    Demographics don't lie.  Religion in it's former state has a new wrapper and it's not supported by any political group as our founding fathers wanted it.  We are a diverse group.  If you want to belong here then you must give anyone from a religion different from yours complete rights to disagree but no right takes away what are basic human rights even if your religion disagrees.     "Have some respect for yourself and date your own species"  Where the fuck did you attend college where they taught that other races like blacks and asians were a separate species from whites?     That's the problem. They don't.   They only have some governmental pinheads in Saudi and some others in the Middle East that dictate what is and isn't acceptable.  They're are none more eligible to dictate what is right or wrong then my cat.   Normal Muslims are mostly afraid of the bullies that have invaded the West but I'm not.  If you're listening you cowards and fools, I'm right here in Texas and can't wait.  Best wishes to my real Muslim friends!     Yea, I find it bizarre that all the animals got along in Eden but had to start killing and eating each other because of "the Fall of Man".   Congratulations, you have just summed up the Patriarchal view.  Until you grow old enough to worship Me and respect Me as your Father I have no use for you.  Matriarchal view.  I will love and protect you while you can't protect yourself.  As you grow I will try to guide you and when you are strong enough you will go out and live a good life.  Hopefully you'll remember to call me every other weekend.     I also think I'm lucky to have been born as an intelligent animal in a country and at a time when expressing my opinions won't be a death sentence!    I believe that the average human commits hundreds of acts of kindness toward fellow humans, animals, and sometimes even the environment everyday.  We do this even if its not convenient, necessary,  beneficial to us or in extreme cases may endanger ourselves.  I believe this is the natural human condition and those that prey on others are in the small minority but cause the vast majority of unnecessary pain and suffering by choosing greed, be it power, fame, control or security because they lack a fundamental connection with humanity.  Sad.     To me suffering is a part of life just like death and both are part of the natural world.  What is considered cruel in nature is only a human construct.  Only humans inflict cruelty on each other when they don't need to.  I "think" my cat is being cruel by "playing" with an insect or mouse before he kills it but is he?  Maybe he is perfecting some hunting skill or making sure he won't get stung or bitten.  I know for sure I don't know for sure why my fellow Earthmates do what they do so I'll hold my human-centric judgment on my cat and dolphins for now.  Then again I doubt they give a shit! LOL            You made my point and yours.  God's existence can't be proved by perfection.  There is no perfection in nature, only adaptation to available opportunities.  What we think of as cruel in nature when compared to human actions is begging the wrong question. If perfection existed then we wouldn't be having this discussion.  Humans might think the blue-footed boobie is "heartless" when she won't let won't own offspring back into the nest after it falls out or is pushed out by a sibling but I believe it's wrong to place human emotions or judgments on animals.    I don't think the insect that lays her eggs in the abdomen of another species that in turn eats it way out of it's host is anymore evil then dolphins or hyena's that "rape" each other.  Rather than being pointless, it has lead to the survival of many species.  This doesn't mean human behavior follows suit since we have developed the capacity for long-term consequences.    I would hazard a guess but when innocent people are hurt or killed because you gave that person free will just in order to test their devotion to you.....that is evil.       Would you not agree that the natural world is not evil?  Suffering is a part of nature but unnecessary suffering occurs because of someone's greed.    It says He deceived them which is lying.    I would say that the struggle for life among animals is amoral and not evil.  Evil, as defined in the bible, is knowing right from wrong but conscientiously choosing wrong.     Here comes the textual argument.  I have, have you?  I was confirmed in the church and after finally reading the bible thoroughly and not just what was picked out for me I understood what they were trying to shield me from.     I form the light, and create darkness: I make peace, and create evil: I the Lord do all these things.  Isaiah 45:7  If He doesn't DO evil he damn sure created it which is worse, IMO.   Why then does he do it by proxy?  Ezekial 14:9 and 2 Thessalonians 2:11   Where does it say in the bible God can't do evil or lie?   I haven't ignored you Furo Ergo Sum.  I've been involved with life's distractions otherwise known as reality.  Forgive me.  What I meant my your prejudices is the resistance by you to acknowledge the basic female or baseline development of many organisms.    Not all animals reproduce sexually.  Some animals such as Aphids that normally reproduce sexually will reproduce asexually through the mother producing only daughters and will only produce males during certain citations.  I can think of no instance when a male organism has ever been able to reproduce asexually.  I'm not saying males are irrelevant in our species but they aren't the go-to sex biologically.  Whether or not you think Jost's experiments mean anything is irrelevant.  Science did and does appreciate his contribution to the understanding of embryology.  You have missed the point.   I'll try one more time.  For people to get the traits encoded in their genes, the genes need to be turned on. You can think of a gene as a recipe. A recipe in a cookbook does you no good until you open the book, get the ingredients and follow the instructions  The same is true with our genes. In our analogy, the gene is the recipe and the cookbook is the chromosome (a large collection of recipes). The gene needs to be "read" by the cell in order for it to do what it should.  However, the gene may be misread or the chromosomes are faulty.   By studying why chromosomes/genes act why they do, medical science hopes to understand other medical diseases.  When you add the influence of hormones to the genes it becomes really complicated.      There was a Seinfeld episode on this as was other little niggling petpeaves on the show. I recall it had to do with the " Bubble Boy" and Jerry trying to follow George down the Parkway.    Was Jerry driving too slow or was George driving too fast?   Maybe, maybe not.  All I know is I got to use the word niggling in context.     Two packaged boiled and peeled eggs.     "Methinks you do protest too much!" and with so much mindless moronic cussing and bold face type to try and bolster your points;  you come off as defensive.  I take your response, "who cares" telling.  Obviously you do so and in a big phallic way!    The original discussion began in an attempt to reconcile genesis with biology and why the bible asserted women came from men and not the other "natural" way around.  You have outed your prejudices by denying the science you claim you aspire a degree in.  Good luck with that young student.     Actually it's the number of old people having sex.   I agree with you that it happens not only to teens but way into adulthood also but you don't need to be mean to discover your own self-worth.  It's never justified either in childhood or adulthood.   Your assertion that male and female tissues develop in tandem and that only the external genitalia remains ambiguous is wrong (typical guy, only concerned on what's on the outside lol!).    The Wolffian ducts develops 2 weeks before the Mullarian ducts.  Males will lose all remnants of the M ducts and females will eventually lose the W duct itself but not its undifferentiated gonad.  Those become the ovaries. Without the interference of testosterone and a antiMullarian hormone from the testis the fetus will continue on to develop as a female.  Males will develop their penis and scrotum from what would have become the clitoris and labia folds.  Perhaps during the course of your "studies" you will come across the work of Professor Alfred Jost, a French endocrinologist.  His experiments with rabbits proved that if you removed the undifferentiated gonads the animal will default (his words, not mine) to the female sex.    After the holiday break go back to school and learn the difference between sex determination, sex differentiation and undifferentiated tissue.  Hopefully then all this will all make sense to you.  If not just ask your professor or better yet, spend hours contemplating your own nipples.  Happy New Year!     The cop told me to reschedule my court date and said if he doesn't show up the ticket has to be dismissed if I plead not guilty.    Turns out if you live in a big city and you reschedule the issuing officer will either not be notified in time or will not be able to be present.  That being said it may just be a Texas law that the officer must be present and it definitively won't work in a small town.        Right after 911 when I was in the military I was pulled over in a school zone along with several other cars.  He walked down the line taking our license plates numbers then came up to us individually for our DL and registration.  When he came to me and found out I was military he mumbled, "You have better things to do" and told me how to beat the ticket even though he had to write it.    It worked and has worked every time I've received any kind of moving violation.   Okay, I'll play.  At conception, the zygote has sex chromes that are either XX(female) or XY(male). The mother's egg always gives X but the father's sperm determines the extra X or Y which determines the potential sex of the child.  Sometimes, as in the case with all sexual dimorphism, there will be anomalies such as males having XXY, XXYY or females with only X.  Most will present as males having female attributes due to the lack of the dominate influence of testosterone from the developing organs and the hormonal influence.    Genes not only determine the sex but they play a part in determining when hormones turn of and on and subsequently how further developments happen.  It's not written in stone guys but it's incrementally important.    Even the emotional state of the mother can influence production of hormones that can have an effect on her baby.     I doubt you could even make one coherent argument to challenge this opinion.      Infuriating isn't it.  I do have one correction for Paxalot.  Although female is the default mode until genes and hormones come into play, the zygote and subsequent fetus aren't really female or male but have the potential for both.  If you must rely on genes themselves it's telling that males are one chromosome off from females and not the other way around. Few die-hard misogynists will even acknowledge the science of embryology like some congress"men" from my state!    The point though is even with our scientific understanding why do some people subscribe to an ancient mythology that reduces the importance of females and consequently subjugates them to males?      Ignorance is understandable.  Willful ignorance is just sad and pathetic.    A lot of people think "heroin addict" and just don't get it.  Lots of riders live normal lives as long as they can stave off the withdraw.  You don't get high, you just don't get sick.  Still it's a pretty shitty existance.     Pretty much most of my family was/is sociopathic, addicted or manipulative but I've mostly known this since I was a teenager.  That said, the only person in my inner circle that turned out to be really, really bad was my brother-in law.    I first met him when I was pregnant in the mid nineties.  He had married a woman with a young daughter and she was pregnant with their child.  They had bought a house and seemed happy and normal.  A year later we stayed for a couple of nights with them during vacation. Never saw anything out of the normal.  He maybe drank a little too much but nothing out of the ordinary for a southern redneck IYNWIM!  After some years they divorced as did I so I only followed my BIL through my ex and son.  Turns out he had a pretty serious drinking problem and eventually spent time in a state prison for a felony DUI where they took his DNA which is standard procedure.  Turns out his DNA turns up as a match for a murder that was nearly 20 old in another state.  The case was featured on TV for unsolved murders.  In short, a mother of two who worked as a dancer at a strip club was found murdered by her two young kids and the babysitter in her trailerhouse two years before I met him.   An investigation followed and he confessed to her murder.  He's still awaiting trial.    It still creeps me out that I stayed in the same house with a murderer with my newborn and that my kid grew up around him.      I'm not particularly good at rap or poetry so I'll give you my best suggestion.    You've made millions promoting a thug lifestyle that influenced countless impressionable kids to embrace morals that weren't exactly beneficial to them.  You then had kids of your own and changed your song.  Good for you.  Glad you realized the impression media has on youth.  IMHO, you should rap about being the Scrooge, what with the negative attitude toward the police and then make a video of you rapping about how the police can be your friend and school is cool.  You asked, just sayin'  Good speed to you and your campaign.     DamnitGoose now the long needle dicks will feel inadaquate!   This is why girls are bad at math!   Almost!  My SO was tending a fire and some embers landed on the carpet in front of the hearth and he was so consumed with the fire that he didn't know that our carpet had caught fire.  I put it put with his beer.    I'm going to do this and film the results.     It was only the towels and matches but the worst was the toothpaste in the carpet   Even with gas it takes forever to get dry wood to burn.   We lost the Scopes Trial just like Evolutionists wanted.  We wanted to take it to the Supreme Court but the judge, just like a sidewinder, devised a way to prevent it by knowingly setting the fine himself to $100 instead of the jury which was supposed to be under $50 and so under the law the verdict was thrown out along with any chance of appeal.  Never underestimate your opponent no matter how misguided.   Unless you've been raised in this religion it seems strange the a God has to sacrifice his godson's life to absolve humans of their failings that the Christian god knew would happen in the first place.  What can be gained by having someone else suffer except a sense of guilt.     According to the Jews, the real Messiah was not to be the sacrificial lamb that leads to heaven.  The Jewish religion proscribes no heaven nor hell.  The messiah was to lead the Jews from persecution to a peaceful reign of the Jews over this world.  The big change from Judaism to Christianity and Muslim was this point.  Xtians and Muslims focus on a reward in an afterlife and Jews are about a reward in this life.   Get it?  Got it?   Duh!!!!   Listen to the song first.      I'll try. A sacrifice means that what you gave can never be returned. Period.  Final.  God never sacrificed his son because he was reincarnated and lives forever within His houses.     No, no you don't, at least not in Fort Worth, Texas.     Good grief!  Get over the idea that music, art, or even culinary expressions can't be expressed and enjoyed by people of all faiths.  I'm atheist and I love gospel music, the paintings of the ideologues of the Greek Orthodox church, and hot-cross buns.    Worship is one thing....appreciation is another.   Do you really believe that your product is that good?  I mean do you stand behind all the company hype?  I ask this because they have moved into burger heaven areas and after the newness rubs off, all that's left is well a good but not great burger.   A better question is why are some Christians obsessed with Biblical literalism especially when it comes to forcing their own views down the throats of American public school children.       As an atheist, I don't have any problem with an American Indian believing that a tarantula created the earth or any of the other 4,000 or so Creation stories.  Why should I?  Everyone has an opinion and I, as a veteran, defended their ability to hold and cherish them whether right or wrong.    What I and others have a problem with is when a faction of this country seeks to demand that their religion is supreme above all.  They declare that the majority of our forefathers were Christians so that means we are a Christian nation.  The fact that the majority were Christians doesn't mean their intentions were to make this country's government tied to Christianity in anyway shape or form.  Let me say this again,  The fact that the majority were Christians doesn't mean their intentions were to make this country's government tied to Christianity in anyway shape or form.  Get it?,  Got it?,  Good!  No one is trying to take away any of your rights! Believe what you want, we just don't want taxpayer's money paying for religious symbols for select Americans and unless you want the idea of an intelligent  God-tarantula being taught then let the public schools stick with strict math and science sans the ID stuff.   Sorry but there's no geological evidence of any world-wide flood but it's not surprising that cultures all over the world can relate to a flood since they happen everywhere.  At least that's what my insurance agent told me lol.   You are pretty fucking stupid and don't deserve any disability from SS and if your Ins. paid then you should pay them back for your own stupidity.  Sorry about your crappy looking toes but it doesn't beat my uncle when he raised up the running lawnmower and sliced of several of the tips of his fingers.  You both belong in a pile of morons and drive up the cost of insurance!   Owls?  I love owls.  Owls love to eat.  Owls love to eat rodents.  Owls also love to eat a small rodent like Chihuahua dog that lives next door that likes to yip and bark for hours on end.  Yea owls!  I love owls.  And hawks, vultures, ect.  Did I say I love owls?   As I load their bags with candy I think I'll whisper, "In Satan's name.". LOL   Prayer, in its simplest form that I was taught as a child is NOT asking  God or Jesus any help for me or anyone else. Prayer is not to ask for special favors even when you want something that you think is special.  Praying is only to acknowledge, reflect and confirm your faith in Jesus and not some magical path for health or prosperity for you or your family to (lose) pay money into.  Please don't be mislead! If even two people pay attention to me and recognize not only the religious scams churches use, but they will enlist your help to place your elderly parents or relative in a substandard retirement home where they receive kickbacks. Sounds lovely?! Don't bet on any of it.  They will take your money and spend it on new golf clubs before the ink is signed on your parents contract!   The gospels provide clues to the life of Jesus but the actual life and death of Jesus was never and has never been corroborated by any outside sources including the Romans' that had this habit of recording everything that they could.   I won't say that this film was misunderstood as the film didn't reflect the original story but the damage was done to the collective conscience of the viewing public and the original story was lost.  I refer to the original "Frankenstein".  The movie made the story out to be a cautionary tale about the evils and limits of scientific exploration, portraying the monster as a non-verbal, grunting, sub-human. The book, in fact, portrays the monster helping an unknowing family and learns how to communicate in French. Later, he gives a touching soliloquy to his maker that turned his back on him.    The book was not a tale of science over-extending itself but a commentary of how a society can turn a person with potential empathy and intelligence into what they define is a monster.  The latter being much more scary and relevant to modern society!    "Death is from sin nature"  The idea of original sin has been a sticking point for me since I was a child.  To conscientiously punish the progeny for a mistake their parents made is akin to justifying a caste system.  Your parents screwed up so I'm gonna make your existence while you're alive almost unbearable but if you praise me enough I'll reward you after I let you die which I don't have to do but because your parents disobeyed me, who didn't know any better because I never taught them what disobedience meant because I didn't want them to know any better. This made no sense to the naive 10 year old me then it does now.  My great-grandfather was a Baptist preacher. I was confirmed into the Episcopalian Church at age 10 and have been studying various religions including Christianity for the past 40 years.  Some things have become clear to me concerning Christianity.  A great deal of guilt is laid on Christian children just for being born. They are told that because of original sin sex is bad but necessary and even their future death is also because of sin.  All this adds up to atonements, offerings, sacrifices to the priests that can direct them to a way to escape death and live forever, (which as far as I know, no one has been able to do) and makes the priests, reverends, popes etc., rich while robbing the hopeful yet gullible.     The sad thing is that while pinning their hopes on an "afterlife" they neglect and dismiss a precious opportunity of self-conscientiousness that is the rare occurrence of life.   Instead of embracing and cherishing what they have, they claim that this fragile life on this fragile planet means nothing.  You talk about moral absolutes and call me a hypocrite but all I know is that I only have this life as a human on this planet and I will cherish and help future life here as long as it lasts.  Death is the rebirth of life and it's natural and OK!       What?  I've been drinking straight from the cartons since I was I kid. Oh no, suddenly I feel sic.....   Who Louis Armstrong was.  When I was stationed in New Orleans I found out that my boyfriend, who was from Pittsburg, PA didn't know who he was even though the airport there is named after him. He had been there for over three years.  It's a wonderful world!   It does and I can understand your dilemma.  I apologize for some of the conclusions I jumped to.  I had to pull some strings to get stationed where my parents were.  My 4'3" mother had to have a double hernia surgery from lifting my 6'2" step-dad after his heart surgery and stroke and they needed my help.  After I got there I found out that they owed the IRS $6500 or they would lose their house.  I took out a loan and paid the IRS. I stayed there for another year rent free to recoup the loan.  I thought about buying the house but because of foundation problems I decided not to.   They eventually settled on a reverse mortgage which worked out well.  However, I did this with an income of around $43,000.  How you bought a $180,000 home on an income of only 18k at the time or even 25k makes anyone wonder.   Good on ya and at least, even if it's an after thought, you are  taking care or advantage of your relatives.   Good luck to you sir!     "Its my dad's place. he was not well so I came back and am helping with everything. sister moved back in and mom was losing her place (they are divorced but its friendly) so she moved in too."  So you came back to your dad's place to help by having him move in with you? You're not being coherent.    Just responding to your response actually concerning the house.  It was you that indicated the house was still owned by your father. JS   Jesmay, have you ever really read the bible cover to cover on your own without someone there to interpret it for you?  No matter, I have and I will give you just one passage:  Isaiah 13:15-18 NLT  Bueno noches!   Once again, since you aren't legally responsible to pay the property and school tax for your parents, it doesn't count as your tax burden for the purpose of your argument.  When I agreed to pay my parents' property tax it was only to help them; the same as if I paid their electric bill, bought a new AC unit for their home, or even sent them on their dream vacation to Italy.  I still paid my own taxes and because it wasn't my home I couldn't write off or apply my VA disability discount on my federal returns.   It's nice that you're "helping" your parents but it sounds like you are definitely receiving a benefit here because you're not paying rent.  Having lived in PA I know that $7612 a year would be considered pretty cheap rent for for renting a house that size.  Also it's interesting that you collect the rental income from a property you don't own and report that as personal income.    Sounds like you have positioned yourself into a comfortable situation where you can live rent free on only 18k plus; supplementing your income by renting rooms in your parents house to other relatives.    Good job! You still misrepresented yourself, have offered no argument about the ACA and have shown yourself to be a opportunistic moocher and family blood-sucker.  Did it ever occur to you that when they leave/or die it may not be yours?  Maybe so but from what I gather you've probably made sure the will is in order to your benefit.  This sounds like a clear -cut case of elder abuse to me!   	111
 I just woke up and remembered I wrote this late last night. At the time, I thought it was a good idea. What was I thinking?   That being said, I've got part two to work on...    ###**The Battle for Bombing Run** *** Captain Crimson wiped the dried spittle from his mouth with the back of his dirty hand. A cardinal chirped in the distance. The melodic song rang out sharply against the bleak backdrop of the battle at hand.      Crimson and his team of three had been immersed into a serious battle for the past eleven hours. He knew that the final hour would determine the fate of his crew. Sergeant Jasper was Crimson's right-hand man. Jasper was a faithful patriot; one that had worked hard to achieve his position. Though, he had willingly trampled over many to get to where he was. There was also Poppy, an older man whom everyone respected and revered. No one knew his birth name. Due to his age and fatherly appeal, others started calling him Poppy. It picked up quickly. Esbe Juan was the final member of the bunch. His motives rarely clear and his actions always unexpected, Esbe held the lowest rank of the bunch; Private First Class. The cadre of four had been through a lot together. This was just another page in the expanding catalog of lessons learned.  "We're marooned!" yelled Esbe. "Absolutely stranded! There's nothing we can do to win this battle. We've got to lay down our arms; live to fight another day."  "There will not be another day, Private!" Poppy barked. "*This* is our day to win. I'd rather die than forfeit."   Jasper didn't speak. He was deep in thought, pensive, looking out over the battlefield. He couldn't see clearly through the spike sector, but knew that on the other side stood a team of four re-positioning for the final attack.  "Here's the plan," said Captain Crimson. The others gathered around. "Poppy, as always, I want you to provide an impenetrable wall. Do not let anyone through, you understand me?" The old man nodded his head as he unwittingly tugged at his wispy white beard.   "Esbe," the Captain continued, "you stay with Poppy. Do whatever he says the moment he speaks. Protect our...Esbe...Esbe!"   Esbe apologized as he returned to the circle. As the Captain was speaking, Esbe had wandered off to the side to admire a rock.  "I've got it," Esbe confirmed. "I'm following you to the enemy's base."  Jasper hit Esbe in the back of the head. The Captain shook his head in disgust, but maintained his cool composure. "No Esbe. Just no. Do the opposite of what you just said and you'll be on the right track."   Captain Crimson looked out over the horizon. "There are only two ways to get to the prize. Jasper, you take the south path. I'll take north. I would advise against pursuing the ammunition in the middle of the spike sector. I think it's a trap. There might be mines or bombs hidden in the ground. It's just not worth it."  Jasper blinked his agreement. "I'll go south, trying my best to take a speed pad for a quicker arrival. We reconvene on the other side?"  "Yes, Sergeant," Crimson said. "If we attack from opposite directions at varying speeds, I think we will throw them off, providing us with a small window to grab the prize and return home."   They all knew what the prize was. The enemy's glorious flag was the treasure that would end this battle in their favor. The score was two all. This final hour would consume the lives of one team, leaving the other as victors.  Captain Crimson looked at his ragtag group of soldiers. They'd do just fine, he hoped.   "It's time," he said, looking one last time at the ominous battlefield in front of him.  "Roll out!"  *To be continued.* ***   Theologians differ on this point. The Bible doesn't speak to the subject specifically. However, Genesis 6:3 might be referencing the reversal of long life by God saying, "My spirit shall not always strive with man, for that he also is flesh: yet his days shall be a hundred and twenty years."  When man and woman were originally created, they were done so perfectly. No sin equals no sickness. The punishment of sin was death, but it came slowly and gradually sped up as new generations came.   The expansion of sin in our world today gives us less and less years to live. That is why it is important to realize that *now* is the day of salvation (2 Cor. 6:2).   Woet just kept coming into my test map games, using up the speed pads, blowing the bombs, taking the flag, and scoring. Woet...   I imagine that halfway through the game the other team just stopped and sat in base. "It's not worth it guys. Let's just let him have his fun. It'll all be over soon."   Also, there is a guy on the other team named **Butt Blood**. So...there's that.   This.   I'm not sure this is a good thing.    Also, if you are NOT going to pull a punch, that means you ARE going to hit hard. Pulling a punch means that you will be reserved.  Pack a punch means you are going to hit hard. If you are NOT going to hit hard, then...why the throwaway? I so confused...   We need movies that aren't "Christian movies", but that are made by Christians. I am sick and tired of believers thinking that there are such genres as Christian music, Christian television, or Christian movies. It appears that it is mainly in the art world. I think we've got it wrong.  A Christian message isn't always the gospel step by step. *The* Christian message is redemption, and that can be shared a number of ways. It doesn't have to be a song quoting John 3:16. It can be a song about hope, joy, and love, and accomplish more. Same goes for a movie. We are doing more damage making and supporting movies like God's Not Dead. Wake up Church.   So...if you were going to "pack punches" you would have used your primary account?    I like this. Not that I'm trying to get to the top of the leaderboard or anything....  EDT...EST...STD...whatever.   I'm playing a free online competitive game called **TagPro**.   I know it's been mentioned before, but it is a great game. It is still a new game; in its birthing stages. It is simple in style and gameplay. Think capture the flag, but as rolling balls with spikes and bombs. If you aren't playing yet, or haven't even given it a try, do a quick Google search for TagPro and play a game or two. See how addicting it becomes.   http://i.imgur.com/zwG5tjN.jpg  Mine was a few seconds longer, but I managed to capture twice.   Wow. Great stuff. Saved to view after work.   Check out this in-depth guide by /u/nivarius for strategy and map specifics!   The guillotine. Do you people understand? Do you even freakin' understand?    ^Legal ^Disclaimer: ^A ^lot ^of ^this ^information ^has ^been ^said ^before. ^I ^am ^not ^your ^definitive ^one ^stop ^shop ^for ^all ^things ^TagPro. ^This ^is ^merely ^observed ^advice. ^Additionally, ^you ^should ^seek ^the ^services ^of ^a ^confident ^professional.  *** Hello friends and family. I thought I'd start a semi-regular (not weekly) post attempting to cover some TagPro material from unique angles. These *will not* be advanced skills and techniques guides. There are plenty of those which can be found [here in the Wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/TagPro/wiki/index#wiki_skills_and_techniques). These *will*, however, be quick articles meant to encourage and instruct players on how to become better at TagPro.  *** I want to start by answering a very simple question: **How can I become a better player?**   Here are 10 easy steps to follow to begin the process of becoming a better player:  1. **Listen to constructive criticism.** There are a lot of mean people with dirty mouths. But there are also a lot of nice people with dirty mouths. Listen to the nice people. I've been in many games where more skilled players than I gave helpful advice during or after the game. Don't take this for granted.  1. **Pick a role and excel at it.** You can play both offensive and defense, but few people play both extremely well. Find out what you're best at and stick to it. Not everyone needs to be the offensive "hero". When there are too many running in for the enemy's flag, there is no one left at your base to defend. Likewise, if everyone is on defense, you'll never score.  1. **Be flexible.** While you do want to have a role your best at, be willing to play the opposite role for a game or two. Usually the best strategy is two on offense/two on defense. If someone on your team is dead set on playing O, be willing to roll D for a game for the sake of the team.  1. **Don't play for the score.** Many beginners think that the score displayed at the end of a game determines who is the best. This is simply not true. In a game, focus on helping your team win. Sometimes this will translate to the scoreboard. Sometimes it will not. TagPro is a team game and really shines when players work together and make it a team effort, win or lose.  1. **Be skeptical of speed pads/boosts.** I'm not saying don't use them. Just be wary. They can be used purposefully and with great results. But they can often leave you with the opposite intended effect.   1. **Learn how to best use power-ups.** Believe it or not, power-ups are powerful. The Wiki contains a [power-up section](http://www.reddit.com/r/TagPro/wiki/index#wiki_power-ups) that aptly describes each ability. /u/GekkoPie also created a wonderful [beginner's guide to using power-ups](http://imgur.com/a/n2usj) efficiently. Learn how to use them and then go for them whenever they spawn. In the right hands serving the right purpose, they help your team more than you know.  1. **Learn the maps.** When you are randomly thrown into a new map, roll around and figure out its layout. There might just be hidden areas or nice traps that you can utilize to your advantage. Click to view the [current rotation of maps](http://www.reddit.com/r/TagPro/wiki/index#wiki_current_rotation).  1. **Learn the lingo.** GG, MB, and NP mean nothing unless you know the language being spoken. The Wiki contains a great section on [Chat Abbreviations](http://www.reddit.com/r/TagPro/wiki/glossary#wiki_chat_abbreviations) so you can be [abreast](http://thegaily.ca/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/006HeartBoobies_V1_W-2.jpg) of quick communication tactics while in game.   1. **Play a pick-up game.** I just recently [wrote an article](http://redd.it/20wvjq) on how to join PUG games through Mumble. There is a [Wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/TagPro/wiki/index#wiki_mumble) and other great posts on the subject as well. One of the main things that helped with my TagPro game was to get out of community games and play with skilled players via Mumble.  1. **Practice the Golden Rule.** Treat others the way that you would like to be treated. Be nice. Be helpful. Be respectful. I know that TagPro is a competitive game that can quickly get heated. I know it is incredibly frustrating to feel like you are awesome and your team is the worst. But we are trying to build a healthy, fun, and friendly community. You can help with this. Don't detract from the hard work that many have put into building this game and community. Treat others the way that you would like to be treated.  Hope this helps us all become better players. Do you have any comments or ideas of what could be added to this list?   *P.S. I'd love suggestions for future posts if you have any. Message me.*   Edited a bit so it is more general rather than just for U.S. Why can't the Americans get it together?   Was able to do a write up. Hope it helps guys.   http://redd.it/20wvjq   I probably should add a single line for this. Don't want to go into detail over Mumble tactics, as there are already posts concerning that.    ^FYI: ^This ^will ^be ^a ^quick ^walkthrough ^of ^using ^Mumble ^for ^the ^first ^time. ^It ^will ^not ^be ^a ^comprehensive ^ins-and-outs ^of ^Mumble ^guide.  For some, Mumble is an intimidating place to go and try to get involved in. It is much easier to go to the [TagPro Website](http://tagpro-origin.koalabeast.com/), log in, and then click "Play Now" (and believe me, there is no ceremony, you can jump right in). True, you might get called a n00b. Certainly, you might run into the same spike twelve times and cost your team the game. Absolutely, your mother might be called a whore. But these are all risks that you are willing to take because, after all, you only put a limited amount of effort into playing this game in the first place.   But, you've played for a few months now. You actually enjoy the game. In fact, you are actually getting pretty good at the game. Sure, people still call you a n00b, but you look right back at them and lol in their face while you carry their flag through a tumultuous throng of terrifying tyrants. Casual community play has become something of less intrigue, but you've heard of this mysterious thing called *Mumble*. But it takes commitment. It takes a few minutes worth of set up. You can't just click "Play Now" (no ceremony, jump in). It is a big step to take, no denying that. But if you are interested in learning the basic steps of how to enter into and enjoy the world that is Mumble, read this quick and easy guide to help sooth your doubts. ***** **I. Defining Mumble** ***** **Mumble** is a voice over IP (VoIP) application similar to programs such as TeamSpeak and Ventrilo. For tagpro, it's best place to organize pick-up games (PUGs) and also just to talk to other players. The games you play that are set up here are often of significantly higher quality than normal public games. New players who regularly play PUGs often improve faster than those who don't.  /u/DrMcDonald has written up an excellent [Guide to Mumble for Newbies and Dummies](http://redd.it/1uqrhu) that i'd suggest you read for more on this.   ***** **II. Download and Setup** ***** * You need to first download the Mumble program from [http://mumble.sourceforge.net/](http://mumble.sourceforge.net/).  Go through some basic setup prompts. You don't have to change any of the preset options unless you really know what you're doing. It is a fairly vanilla program.  * When you see the [Mumble Window](http://i.imgur.com/ZlEWLyg.jpg), you have correctly completed your installation.  * Click Server  Connect  Add New. You'll end up with this [Add Server window](http://i.imgur.com/9GwrYVd.jpg) .  * Input one of the following depending on where you live and where you'll be connecting through.  Label|Address|Port :---|:---|:--- TagPro Mumble|mumble.koalabeast.com|64738 European TagPro Mumble|mumble-eu.koalabeast.com|64738   Oceanic TagPro Mumble|mumble-au.koalabeast.com|10054  * Input your own username. Click OK  Connect. Congratulations, you're in.  More setup information (regarding headsets and microphones) [can be found here](http://www.reddit.com/r/TagPro/wiki/index#wiki_mumble).  ***** **III. Navigating Mumble** ***** The program [looks like this](http://i.imgur.com/TNq6izL.jpg) once you have gone through the process of logging in correctly. Admittedly, this can look cluttered and confusing thus leading to greater intimidation. Just slow your roll and listen...  There are many "rooms" - some you can go to and some you will need special access to enter. Don't worry about all the clutter, just find the **[PUG rooms](http://i.imgur.com/rLqruiN.jpg)**. In the U.S. Mumble, there are currently three different PUG rooms. Enter one and go through the following steps:  * Listen to see if a game is currently in session. If it is, wait patiently until it sounds like they are done. When they finish, either ask for a link using your mic or type it in the chat box to the left.  * They will provide you with a TagPro group link which, if there is room, will place you into their PUG group. *IF THERE IS NOT ROOM* you will be redirected to the general TagPro Groups page. Don't panic. They aren't trying to get rid of you by subterfuge. Just ask politely for the link again when there is room in the group.  * Once in, you might have to sit as a Spectator for a game or two if there are a lot of people in the group. This is normal, and can actually help you learn as you watch good players play.  * Soon, you will be able to switch off Spectator Mode and join a real live PUG game.   *[Remember, this is just a basic walkthrough of how to navigate Mumble and play your first PUG. It is not comprehensive. For more information, please visit this [Mumble Wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/TagPro/wiki/index#wiki_mumble) and/or this [Guide to Mumble](http://www.reddit.com/r/TagPro/comments/1uqrhu/a_guide_to_mumble_for_newbies_and_dummies/). If you have further suggestions/edits, please suggest them below.]*   If you give me until tomorrow, I will try to write up an explanatory guide to using Mumble for the first time.   I'll tell you why Mr. /u/DeweyIsOverrated. It is because Ubisoft intentionally leaks things so that we get super hyped like this.   My belief is that we will not see concrete theatrical trailer evidence until E3. They want to hype Watch Dogs. But they don't want to leave us assassins behind. They will continue to drop breadcrumbs every couple of weeks to appease us.    And subscribed. Thank you for ruining my life.   I feel like I need more of this in my life for some reason. Please make this a thing.   I know that a dedicated Wiki would be useful for mods and users alike. It can answer a lot of the questions that were in the previous stickied message and a lot more. There are a number of repeated posts (i.e. Which game should I begin with? Will they conclude Connor's story? etc.) that have been answered a hundred times. A Wiki could help tremendously with this.  In regards to rank, I think having a ranking system is fun and intriguing. I do think that the way it is currently being done is difficult. I don't know enough about Reddit to offer alternative solutions, but developing a different system might be necessary. Maybe instead of the words, an icon can depict rank. That's my two cents.   In the past, Ubisoft has sped up their trailer releases and game information releases due to leaks. Do you think we will hear something official soon because of this leak?   Simple question: Which Chess piece is your favorite and why?   [Outfit Feedback](http://i.imgur.com/Eipf2Bm.jpg)  This is a shirt, a pant, and two shoes kinda look.   Colors must have been way off in the picture. My shirt is navy lines, lighter blue, white, and red. Cardigan is navy. Pants are kinda vintage grey. Shoes are light blue. Sorry about that guys and thanks for the feedback.   Freakin' A. We've got a person here, guys. Never thought i'd meet one!   I'm from Temple. An hour north.   http://i.imgur.com/gIFkcWR.jpg  Winter to Spring switch.  I know it's dark and hard to see detail. Feedback?   Where in Texas Kobe? I'm from the central area.   26 year old married man that is working on my doctorate in Organizational Leadership.  Also a 25 year old male law student.   Heading over there. I'll come back and report my findings...if I make it out alive.   [Mwahaha](http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_ma2ozgDTjM1rf2jmdo1_400.gif)   That was a crazy map. Good to see you Rookie!   staer signs up   staer will try and play   I've been playing regular community games for a couple of months now and was regularly frustrated by trolls/bad players/quitters/etc.   I manned up an hopped on Mumble tonight, was playing in a game within five minutes, and everyone was nice and very helpful.  I just wanted to encourage other capable players to try out Mumble and see if PUG games are for you. They are for me.    I think those fit you very well. I wouldn't go longer. In fact, I wear mine slightly shorter than that. Really, wear them where it makes you feel comfortable and still looks good. Which seems to be exactly what you're doing.   I need a couple pairs of socks for the following:  **Chinos** (sand, camel, grey, navy)  **Jeans** (black, indigo)  **Suits** (black, navy)   I'm not sure that the original image of "Great Fall" was confirmed a fake. I know that some of the "leaked" videos were.   I personally think it was completely fake, along with Desert Son, but I wouldn't doubt that there will be two releases this year.   **http://whatculture.com/gaming/assassins-creed-v-5-things-know-far.php**  **Summary:**  1. *Setting* - Assuming the Industrial Revolution because of Ubisoft Tumblr leak or Russian frontier because of AC Initiates Twitter posts. 1. *Gameplay* - We will probably see a return of the Brotherhood. No oceanic exploration. More stealth features, assassination missions, historical characters, and access to houses and buildings. 1. *Release Date* - Around Halloween/early November. Ubisoft already has a set information/title release date. Very close. 1. *The Protagonist* - Assuming assassin picture leak from Ubisoft offices in Montreal are real, we will most likely see an Industrial Revolution setting due to dark clothes for dirty times. 1. *Multiple Games* - Referencing Great Fall image leak to suggest that there will be a main title (ACV) and another smaller game released in 2014 (possible Great Fall extending from comics).  Thought it was an interesting read, but didn't seem to add anything new. Your thoughts?  **EDIT:** I'm still not sure if AC Redditors know how/when/why to upvote/downvote. I am sharing a link and reporting statements. I am not trying to say they have found anything new. I agree, the article is fairly poor, but no reason to punish me for it. Don't have to upvote. But no reason to downvote a report.  	44
 Is that ed sheeran...   Cat was stupid. You did what you needed to do, you made a mistake  but it was with the right intentions.    Eye shaged yeh nan.   420 POOOIINNNTTTTTSSS AYYEE   How easy was it getting in?   Name checks out.   Lol well considering im an athiest...    Must suck to live like that, hating on dead religions.   /r/raisedbynarcissists   How in the fuck did they threaten them with death. There was a warning and shit but i mean if your going to talk shit about JWs at least make it less retarded.    I agree but i mean same with the Vatican and all that child abuse shit. Thats like 10 worse.   Thats like asking clouds to stop moving so they can cover the sun forever.   Exactly.    First of all, its a quote from the comics. Second, you are a little bitch.   What. The. Fuck. Kid, you need help. Fuck man, that's gross.    http://m.imgur.com/gallery/XS5LK   Luv u Op sleep well in hell   Thank you.

Your mother looks beautiful in every picture,  she should be proud.    Please tell me your dogs name is frodo.   Right?! I dont want glenn gone :c   It was HUGE foreshadowing,  they focused on that bat for like 10 seconds, unless the writers are just honey dicking us with a nod to the comics.    What matters is what your doing now, everything you've gone through has turned you into a (most likely) great person. It takes balls to do what you did and then admit to it.    Your a good man. Remember that.   Not saying anything is worse.   Such a great movie, loved it.    Not as much as the witnesses.    So is the pope in the Vatican,  yet most people don't 'nit pick' that religion.    Yes, mostly everyone that judges these people.    This guy notices it, higher ups do, then gov. Officials do. They think "hey this guy is right we dont like religion" they announce to the world, " NO MORE RELIGION" everyone in a religion gets fucked.   Wtf, i love how everyone points out the witnesses as the only ones ever doing shit wrong. Not every religion is perfect. Nor the people.   I have that table too :D   /r/raisedbynarcissists   Alrighty, THEN WE HAVE SOLVED THE CASE!    'I' , unless its only on S5's   No, i meant the "i am a beautiful person" part. That always comes out as the suggested text when simply putting 'I'   Haha gotta love Samsung (:   Vampire Weekend, Grouplove, MGMt, Passion Pit. Good shit.   FUCK. Damn. Shiiit. Met the guy, he was so damn great. Shit, eyes are sweating.    You dun fucked up   Hell yeah -.-   Multiple universes with multiple timelines   "Why you gotta be so ruuude?" Yes you need the "ruuude" part.   Dylan ryder?   Dont worry, You will have even shittier days than this, but you'll realize something on that day, you will realize that today wasn't half bad.    18, im not engaged or anything its just that its a fear of mine.    Im afraid of having a family and not being able to support my SO.   You got catfished! Hook, line, and sinker.   OP Deliver goddammit!    IN THE DUNES OF THE CAPE.    For loving and giving a shit? Fuck you bro.    Fuck off you fucking cocksucker. You little bitch faced cunt.  Good day to you sir.    In her mind you said: "you are a fat insignificant bitch   i couldn't care less about you. Your pretty fucking disgusting too." You dun fucked up   /r/wincest (;    Fuck you prick. Sorry OP not all Texans act like this piece of shit.    If you have half a brain.   And getting caught in the rain!   I saw it in the theater, i was scared shitless.   Stay strong man, your all set up. It hurts to go through a divorce but its necessary. Have the best of luck.   WELL MY GF'S PRIUS IS GAY.    My gf's prius actually needs the key inside the car in order to actually leave. Skeptical about OPs story.   God damn. Im just proud of you OP. Have an upvote.    You dont need her, its sad to live your life by having to look over your shoulder because someone is stalking you, especially if that person is your own mother. Some people are just sick. No offense OP.   "THOSE AREN'T MOUNTAINS,  THEY ARE WAVES!"   "Was that fat kid fake too?!"   Kill yourself OP   Ha! Inexperienced redditor!    Fuck her bro, move on, get a new phone and fuck a new/sexier bitch.    Thats kinda fucking gross... lol but hilarious   Lets play spot the redditor!    Thats pretty fucking sad.   Go fuck your girlfriend on your mothers bed. While your mother watches. Look her straight in the eye. Assert dominance.    Happened to my girlfriend. What can you do right? I can't be disgusted for her being a human haha.    OP is in wrong Subreddit, you belong in  /r/Nosleep OP!   Speak of the devil.. and he will appear.   ITS SO HD.    #roasted...   /r/Interstellar   Hopefully i have the same outcome as you! Haha   Duuude. I know its real. I was making fun of the conspiratards.    Yup!   i plan to change the color. It looks like rust chose not to even look at it! Thank god. Haha   Engine: http://imgur.com/2SQTEoR      "SOYLENT GREEN IS PEOPLE"   Well how could a hardcore 'nerd' not know what the Spider-Verse is and who is in it. Get outta here dick breath.   Enjoyed this movie.    IM NOT CRAZY. Just informed. Hey! We all got each other though, even though this is the only place i can release my true thoughts on world matter. They ask me "what do you think of obama" me: "nice guy, very black, no racism" little do they know.    My dad fell off his ladder while working there, he messed up his knee and back. They are fighting against him in order to not give him workers Comp. Fuck them.   Dude i fucking hate that, this is my opinion and you think im crazy for it. Im just trying to keep other people informed goddammit!   Sandy Hook, the moon landings are just two of the government and hollywoods greatest pieces of work.   not really the greatest.  Well when it comes to sandy hook, considering that it was obviously bull shit right from the beginning. If your going to fake something at least get all your facts right. Im looking at the part of the news cast when they say theres like 2 or 3 shooters.      It will make it to top five but Avengers without a doubt will be number one.   Im kidding bro /r/conspiratard   Considering he was a soldier before this and had been injured and got his legs taken off during his time in the army meaning his leg weren't blown off during the boston bombing.  	101
 i would atleast like some feedback if that isnt to much to ask      Master yi : "i sold my jungle item so i could deal more damage who needs that when im going to gank anyway"   i think aoki and kimura are going to improve with ippo this time around. Ippo lost and after his last loss he made the dempsy roll, but im thinking this time around ippo will be improving himself by helping aokimura out. possibly creating the new dempsy in the process and making aoki learn a move that isnt the frog punch. kimura just kind of sits back in his matches which isnt bad but he doesnt seem to do anything until the last rounds. were also still waiting on mike bison to find out how that goes if that match goes like the last matches we will see a mixture of hawk and eagle (which is basically just takamura) which would be takamuras biggest weakness. aokimura will see takamuras struggle possibly and realize that their idol could see a loss and want to improve with him.  	4
 Hahaha we meet again my good friend!   To that i would say we are not trying to go for that wow factor all the time as we would like to see our music be used for things such as movies, commercials, sports films..etc so we like to leave space in the music and without a singer we understand that there isnt always something there that will grab and hold the occasional post rock listener, but that is ok for us. The songs have their moments that grab you and thats all we want, the rest is up to you :)   Hahaha thanks, someone at the bar the other night made the same comment and I had to google it to see bc I couldnt remember..good call tho    We are putting it out there ourselves with the intent of it being used for film and/or commercial work so we would like to make the money that way and not by way of sales, so with that said we will not be selling it but making it available online for free download to anyone who asks..but with any luck the album should be done by then end of this year or the very beginning of next..it comes down to how quick i can mix it all hahaha..keep an ear out tho and facebook is how we keep everyone updated so check that periodically too :) thanks again tho and good ear on the semi circle comment!   Thanks soooo much brotha!! I appreciate that!!   They are live recordings ;) and nice call on the semi-circle...did u see the video?   Thanks soo much man!

He had a habit of walking on the beach before he began his work. One day he was walking along the shore. As he looked down the beach, he saw a human figure moving like a dancer. He smiled to himself to think of someone who would dance to the day. So he began to walk faster to catch up.  As he got closer, he saw that it was a young man and the young man wasn't dancing, but instead he was reaching down to the shore, picking up something and very gently throwing it into the ocean.  As he got closer he called out, "Good morning! What are you doing?"  The young man paused, looked up and replied, "Throwing starfish in the ocean."  "I guess I should have asked, why are you throwing starfish in the ocean?"  "The sun is up and the tide is going out. And if I don't throw them in they'll die."  "But, young man, don't you realize that there are miles and miles of beach and starfish all along it. You can't possibly make a difference!"  The young man listened politely. Then bent down, picked up another starfish and threw it into the sea, past the breaking waves and said- "It made a difference for that one."   *Holy dog shit! Texas? Only steers and queers come from Texas and you don't look much like a steer to me, so that kinda narrows it down.*   Cocaine is a hell of a drug!

 What Earth is this? Multiversity never showed these guys.   The same old people who still use Web-TV.   I threw a iPad at someone. They bled alot.   2spooky4me   All the inbreeding is in McNairy County. God damn hillbilly pig fuckers!   Hope Archer fights them!   A kid in a cloak?   2spooky4me   Micheal Myers.   Speed Racer was a trippy ass trip of a flick.   Baptist Memorial. My Granny died there.   Torrent? Is it in flac?   You da real MVP.   Would rather use the public domain characters we have now anyway. Black Terror, Airboy,the Heap,etc. Build them up from the original stories, add your own continuity and BAM! You now have a stew going.   Kingdom Come was 90's.    Nothing is wrong with Spawn. Most 90's thing would be Youngblood Pogs.   How much are they?   All-Star Squadron. Great read!   Good luck guy! I own the first two on VHS and watch them every few weeks or so. Scream Factory would be the best label to re-release them to Blu-Ray.   And now you hear it everyday on mainstream radio.   He should take off that stupid bunny suit.   Do any of you people know why Continuity is broken at DC? Darkseid won. Barry Allen was the real bullet fired backwards in time breaking reality itself. Why the hell do you think Marvel is having a Secret War?  Because Darkseid broke reality with a living bullet and affected the entire Mega-Multiverse.   AMA please!   .....but he looks like Gravity from the side....   I am 1984 and what is this?   Prez is wandering the Multiverse thanks to Dream. I bet she is Prez himself.   Any of the members play Overpower?   What volume?   What kind of cards and players you got? 70s-00s stuff?   Curse Of The Spawn and Marvel Essential Marvel Universe Handbook. Is the Handbook the '89 Update?   What's going into the storage?   Your mother.   SNL don't like black people!   You selling any of the GNs and books?   What if they were the real Jesus and Armageddon arrived?   How much is the Wolverine Omnibus? Also Global Frequency, Ghost Rider, Punisher War Journal, Punisher Born,etc?   You act like your not going to be in the theatre looking for sin. I know I am.   We just see him pass out.    He was actually a real character who was in the Omega Men.   It's called being human. I doubt a calm mind will appear during a massacre.   You ever been to a Waffle House?   John Titor did.   A spooky skeleton.   More like Over 9000 penises.   Imagine a drug smuggling bounty hunter film by Tarantino.   This is what happens when Pop-Country takes America by storm.   Illinois has Nazis too.   So you like Nickelback all morning long?

The 1986 film Night Of The Creeps. It's a good horror flick.   Jenny.   Chris Hanson would be a great surprise birthday host.   I rather see the Frank Castle Venom from What If...   Oh well. Probably hit a tractor.   The Ghost Of Mr.Skeletal.   Improvise.   I would enjoy a good Capt.Cold vs. Mr.Freeze vs. Killer Frost fight.   But...he shot Greedo first though...   Obama The Obvious .

I came across [the Men In Black comics wiki](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Men_in_Black_%28comics%29) and noticed how Marvel reprinted the original first issue and a few tie in books.

 I've never physically gone somewhere for a random investigation, but I would advise you to do your homework.  a shield is the most basic and most important thing you need to know, so I'm glad you do.  That's the first thing anyone should teach anyone (learned that the hard way).  maybe bring a thermometer or something which has heat vision (maybe there's an app for that?)  You want to be able to detect and document sudden dips and spikes in temperature.  Bring matches.  But, by do your homework, I mean read into where you are going.  What sort of events have been reported from there.  Get a good idea of what you should be prepared for.  Do not go in over your head.  If a place is famous for people disappearing, and there is nothing out there on how or why or anything, don't be stupid and go out there alone to solve the mystery.  I wish I could offer more, but that's all I've got atm.    Work on getting stronger.  Work on expanding your shield, hardening it, feeding more energy to it, etc.  try to heat water; try to diffuse a headache.  Simple things to focus your energy for a purpose.   "Low Rider" by War - George Lopez "Somewhere beyond the sea" by Frank Sinatra - Finding Nemo   I think we can take a page from Europe on this one, just the general concept though: Have campaigns be state funded.    We don't have to give them much.  It can be just a base amount which allows you to run a couple of ads and such.  Everyone, even corporations, would still be allowed to donate, but the donations would be to political parties rather than to individual candidates.  This would alleviate clientellism.  The political parties would then distribute these funds to their candidates according to need/the scope of the campaign.  For example, if you donate $1,000 to the North Carolina Democratic Party, they might distribute $175 to the Gubernatorial candidate, $175 to the Senate candidate, $80 each to 5 House candidates, and  $2.50 to each of the 100 counties' local Democratic Parties.  (This distribution is completely hypothetical; I am not saying that should be the ratio).  You could also donate to the local party organization in your county, if you want the money to specifically go there.   it is affectionately referred to as pork, and that's simply corruption and bribery.  It's all about the money to many, even when it shouldn't be; even when our health and our future is at stake.  We have to have a livable planet and a functional society for money to even matter.  Priorities get twisted with power and greed.  People who have never seen poverty, who have never walked in anything other than designer shoes, can't relate or fully comprehend the effects of their actions, which adversely affect so many.  Spin is another big issue.  Some people (*losely defined*) are so good at putting a spin on things such that people think something will help them when it will only hurt them, and vice versa.  Like the estate tax.   I plan to run for office in an effort to effect as much positive change I can in policy areas including, but not limited to: healthcare, housing, criminal justice, and environmental policy.  For someone who seeks to write and pass legislation, given your in-depth analyses, do you think I would have better chances in the House or the Senate?  Are there any tips from your observations as to what makes a bill more likely to pass if the other party (*Republicans*) don't want to see it happen?  Thank you   oh, sorry; forgot to mention, as far as what it means, if there was something there, could be a ghost, could be being watched by a guardian angel, anything really.  it depends on the specifics, which, if you are in a public place, you may never know, as it could be something tied to you, or the place.     I feel that way sometimes just out of nervousness/paranoia like others said; like if I've watched or read something, or it's dark, or if I happen to think of something which psychs me out into that state.   Also, if you've had a small amount to drink, it is way easy to freak yourself out in this way.  like full on sweaty palms for no reason other than the thought crossed your mind "what if there's something behind me?"  I'm talking about feeling like there's something behind you, or just out of your line of sight.  Feeling like you're being watched is technically a little different.    And there is a definite difference from these feelings caused by nervousness and when they have a legitimate cause.    The former is just a nagging/irking suspicion.  The latter is when you can feel the stare boring into you; like they're burning holes in you from looking/glaring so hard.    are you familiar with Kundalini and Chakras (I apologize for spelling if that's wrong)?  they are energy centers in your back.  The strongest one is in your lower back.  Aka the small of your back.  That's where you feel it when someone is behind you.  If there is really something present, you will feel it there.  no question.  Side note: If you take note of those feelings, then you will start to notice when people are behind you, you feel different people in different ways.  This could be because of their aura at the time (mood they are in; vibe they are giving off), their personality, their intentions, or their relationship to you.  When you trust someone with your life, and are fully familiar with them and in tune almost to the point that you are one person, you may not feel them coming at all.  Some people you may feel coming before they even get close to you.  you may even lean back from the feeling, which is your body trying to balance the pull of energy in your lower back.  (Happened to me right now just thinking about it; because, when I remember things, I remember and re-experience the emotions I experienced at the time).   Anyway, I hope this helps!   So it was hoarding the bottles.  But I wonder what the gate was originally built for, in front of a small area before a dead end...  I guess it's a good thing you (and presumably OBE girl) are not Hispanic.  It probably turned up that time and not the others thanks to the presence of your Portuguese friend of friend.   The strangest part of this story to me is that you're a European in like, your 30's give or take, and the most you've ever drank is 2 shots of whiskey and a beer :p (or some beer, not clear but irrelevant).   One could argue that maybe El Tio, if that's what it was, was summoned by the miners' belief in him, or alternatively, the more likely scenario, which concerns me, is that, since he is supposedly, according to your notes, a guardian, then he showed up to protect his people from something worse that was lurking, which would explain the deaths (if he is a guardian, as you said).    The idea of accepting offerings of cigarettes and alcohol points to the pile as being his hoard, but I don't know whether to think what you saw is El Tio or not.  Since it disappeared when you said its' services (protection) are no longer needed, then maybe.  But, perhaps its services were still needed?  depends on what it was protecting people from.  Although, if so many people died, maybe it wasn't doing a good job.   Or maybe the miners weren't leaving behind as much booze as the teenagers :)  , so it didn't stick around as much.  Who knows?   no; it's not pointless at all.  I don't agree with some of the things you said about existence and identity, but I do agree with what you said about ideas; so, I guess I need to clarify as well.  There aren't really any "original" ideas.  Everything has already been thought of.  You can see that in the progression of technology in the "modern"/"developed" world, where our modern conveniences such as plumbing/running water already existed in ancient Rome, for instance.    We tune into / pick up the idea, and, as is psychologically necessary, it passes though our frame of reference, and we perceive/interpret it as our own, original, idea.    you might have a sleep disorder; but I don't see how sleepwalking and such would enable you to rip the sheets; then again, people can beat people up in such a state.  I have torn Pj's at the seams from moving too much, but that's a whole other animal.    It sounds like you're thinking werewolf or something.  Real life "werewolves" is simply a genetic trait of having too much hair.  I'm thinking you have no comments yet because no one is taking you seriously.  I don't really either, but I am giving you the benefit of the doubt, or rather, belief.  You may also have unwanted visitors.  Mice, Raccoon, squirrel, ghost?  Any signs of any of those unwanted visitors?     actually to address the lucid dreaming more, I have a slightly different take on that than the literature you'll find online.  I've doing it since before I knew about it, and I have a different approach.  Here's what I recommend doing, /u/ShyhiemDragon , :  - first, you need to develop an awareness of when you are dreaming.  I don't have a particular method I use for this, I just generally can tell from context clues/ rationality.  But, to do this deliberately, it would help to come up with a system.  Like a totem (if you've seen Inception).  Think of an action, maybe, that you can't do irl but can in a dream (flying is an example, but may be too dramatic to work at first; letting go of mental barriers and making yourself fly can be hard if you have no experience controlling your dreams, as you have to be really sure of yourself to just leap up and fly.  I've done it but lost my self assurance and plummeted several feet before picking back up; not a good feeling).  So something like that, but milder.  Maybe try to jump over something big or tall. (I can't jump more than a couple inches irl.)  Or, more like the totem, go to sleep with something in your pocket or something.   Taking a step back; you say you have a nightmare problem.  I had so many nightmares as a kid, but I could, most of the time, tell it was a dream.  I learned how to wake myself up.   - close your eyes - focus on the fact that it's a dream - relax as if to meditate; control your breathing - count backwards from whatever number feels natural to you (I used 10; usually would wake up by the time I got to 3 or 4).   I had a horrible literal end of the world nightmare once when I was like 12 or so, and I woke myself up, went back to sleep, and it continued, so after I came aware (didn't take long as it was a continuation), I ran to safety and woke myself up again.  It continued one more time I think.  That was the worst nightmare I ever had, until the sleep paralysis one I just mentioned in another comment above.  They're tied for worst I guess, in different ways.  So, back to the lucid dreaming, - once you have mastered, to a reasonable extent, knowing when you are dreaming, then it is just a matter of taking the wheel.  Being yourself; taking control of yourself, if you get what I mean.  Once you are aware its a dream, just be you, in your body there - start maybe by asking questions.  My favorite I did once was I was in my elementary/primary school, and I saw a janitor; I asked him what year it was, and he said "can't you read the calendar?"  lol - Investigate; walk around; explore; be bold.   - try to fly if you want, but the time I did that, besides dropping myself as I mentioned before, I also felt like it took the magic out of the dream. I like to explore the naturally developed environment of the dream; if you change everything up, then it's just a sandbox and that takes the magic out of it for me.  hope this is helpful   yes, just be careful not to fall into sleep paralysis.  I've never experienced it, but I dreamed that I had one time; a quite vivid dream.  It was easily the most terrifying dream I've ever had.   "T-minues 5 to tea time! We're casting off into Boston Harbor; I hope George likes it salty!"   yeah, like I said, only helps a tiny bit.    Must be combined with good music and tea or hot cocoa, as well as a phone call or chat in order to be of measurable help   High school senior by any chance?  or in community college? here's a list of unconventional and controversial persuasive speech topics:  - we should have 13 months with 28 days each, instead of the 12 months we have.   - High school graduates who are under 18 should be allowed to vote.  - High school graduates who are under 18 should receive full legal rights upon graduation (age of majority law).  (I did this one for my senior thesis/ speech)  - one should have to pass a test of common sense in order to gain the right to vote  - we should require one to pass a psychiatric evaluation in order to purchase firearms.  - we should, like some European nations, have a quota for women in the government  - Daylight savings time is unnecessary.  - Rather than charging students more for things on campus (paying for the convenience), they should instead be subsidized, to help students with cost of living.  (This is how it's done in the UK where I am currently studying abroad, so yeah...)   - Universal Healthcare  (If you are not American, I am sorry, as many of these will not be applicable.)  **DISCLAIMER: these are controversial topic ideas and do not necessarily reflect the views and opinions of the poster.  Thank you. **   there is a word for that actually.  it is commonly referred to as "the oversoul".   I am not a believer in the oversoul, but I do believe in a sort of, what you might call, universal consciousness, just not in that form.  See, /u/TheAlienDude , when we think, speak, or act, we use energy.  These words and ideas are usually in the form of waves.  Sound waves, radio waves, waves of energy from our thoughts, physical shockwaves from our actions, etc.    These waves do not cease to exist when we cease to see or hear them.  They travel throughout the universe.  This is how we pick up on things we could not "possibly" know, and how we come up with seemingly random ideas.  When you get a random idea, google it.  Chances are, someone has already thought of it recently somewhere halfway around the world, and that's just how long the waves took to reach you.  Some people are more receptive to it than others.  Like having stronger antennae.  If I had to guess, I'd say you picked up on their thoughts or conversations about the food they had bought, and interpreted it as your own craving.  However, it is also possible that they picked up on your thoughts about what you wanted to eat, and interpreted it as their own idea of what to buy.   yeah, the "crew" that I sometimes worked with was already in it, we just kind of joined up for some cases, although there was too much drama as I kind of had a secret thing with one of them (also via OBE, (chilling on a cloud over New York City is a great way to spend an afternoon) although we acknowledged it privately in person a couple of times/ways, to assure each other we didn't make it up in our heads).  and like I said, I learned my lesson the hard way about endangering people, with my friend who turned out to be a frenemy, which is why I backed off when I got with my ex, although I've come to regret that decision sometimes.  That rather than backing away, I should have taught him how to defend himself even more than I did, and if I had kept teaching him, we could have eventually fought together, as a power couple.  But that's a moot point now.   this is a story from high school, about the pressure to succeed and the value of life.  (I've told it once before in a public speaking course in undergrad.)  I was dual-enrolled in the community college, and I had AP courses.  I was in a multitude of extra-curriculars.  I handled it well, and I enjoyed it.    I also had a pet fish.  A koi fish named Reggie.  I took care of him all my own; I didn't leave any of the responsibility to my parents.  He was my child; he lived in my room.    Koi are quite intelligent.  He definitely felt a strong attachment to me.  I knew this because, one time, my dad came in the room, and Reggie literally flipped out; thrashing/ spazzing in the bowl, until I said "It's ok, relax; this is my dad."  Then, much to my dad's surprise, and somewhat to mine, Reggie immediately calmed down.  He also spazzed out when I had another visitor, but that's a private tale; although, I should have known to cover the tank.  Reggie was also a nicer fish than I've ever had or known: he let me pet him when I cleaned his bowl.  Later in the school year, my life got insanely busy.  I was doing homework each night from after dinner until about 1 am. He was due for a cleaning, but it was far too late, so I told him I would get to it the next day.  This proceeded for a few days (not really sure how many), until one evening, I came back to my room from dinner to find Reggie floating, very wrong.  His bowl was filthy.  And it was all my fault.  I was in shock/disbelief at first.  I had to poke him a couple of times before I accepted that he was gone.  I took him in a papertowel to the kitchen to announce the news, and I cried over him.  I told him how sorry I was that I let this happen.  I felt like the worst mother in the world, and that I could never be trusted with a life.    I'm crying a little now just remembering that night.  **So, I learned a valuable lesson.  When you are responsible for someone's life, that comes first, before anything.**  It wouldn't have taken too long to clean him.  I could have done it one of those nights before settling down to homework/projects.   I was just too naive.    (I also didn't learn until later that Koi really need a tank, but he was doing fine in his bowl as I had kept it super clean up until then.)  I have looked in the pet stores, but have yet to see another koi with blue eyes like Reggie.    One day, when I have my own permanent place, I will get a koi pond, and a couple of blue-eyed koi fish.    you are not useless.  although its too late for your ferberizing parents to realize the importance of physical affection in raising a mentally and emotionally stable person, it's not too late for you.  Don't be afraid to show affection.    I have been hugged plenty, but lately I get this "really need a hug" feeling too sometimes, and I hug my pillow, which helps a tiny bit.   she made you emotionally damaged and unavailable and that is really fucking sad.  I'm so sorry that happened to you, man.  I broke up with my ex a few months ago (also HSSH); he was all of my firsts, and I was many of his.  But, there were a lot of legitimate issues behind that, and we are still good friends; we are a support system for eachother I guess you could say.    I would never abandon someone like that.  I can only imagine your pain, but just know that there are better, more mature and loving people out there.  Don't put up a wall; that wall will only keep you from finding happiness.    Good luck!  be strong   I have many stories about predictive dreams, but everyone has those and they are abundant.  I have, however, a weird story involving poetry that I wrote.  I have written a lot of serious poetry, but at that particular point in my life, I was in a humor poetry phase, particularly humor at others' expense.  (I know, I was immature in school; so was everyone else).   Our English teacher had been on leave long-term because she had had a baby.  We had a long-term sub who was actually a retired teacher, from the "old school" if you will.  She made us diagram sentences and other tedious, outdated, unnecessary, nit-picky grammatical things.   She also assigned far more homework than we were accustomed to.  We all abhorred that class under her (a word I learned independently that year).  After a few weeks of this, even our parents had complained to the school about the amount of work Mrs.Substy* would assign.  We had no idea when our normal teacher would be coming back.  One day, in homeroom, in the morning, I wrote a poem about her going away.  It was wishful thinking at its' finest.  It started with:  "today's the day, today's the day, the day Mrs. Substy* goes away!..." and ended with a simple "...good riddance!". (I still have the hard, hand-written copy of the poem back at home).  I showed it to my friends and we had a good laugh.  That afternoon, when we went to English class, SURPRISE!  Our regular teacher was back!  Mrs. Substy* really was gone!  At the time, I wondered if this meant I could make things happen by writing poetry, but I realize now, of course, that it meant I subconsciously picked up on the vibe somehow and predicted it.   TL;DR: I wrote a poem about a strict long-term substitute teacher going away that day, and then she actually did.   and it's funny that you reference knowledge and truth.  at one point, I referred to myself as "the bearer of truth" .   I am currently in graduate school, and always an independent student of many more disciplines; life is a long pursuit of knowledge.    Most people don't pay attention to the truth, only what they are told.  I focus my online posting, in all mediums, to do everything I can to raise the public awareness of the lies and injustice in our world.  My whole life's mission (including my career goals), the reason I believe I am here on this earth, is to fight for truth and justice.     I see this account has also only been around for a few days like our friends here, so I take it you made it for these discussions?  Thus, does "iwasthesword" mean that you have a personal experience you aren't sharing?  Calling yourself a sword....so you feel used?  I don't know what your experience is, but I have never felt used by fighting for life and light, only empowered.    If you felt used, I'm afraid you may have been dealing with something different entirely.  Unnatural is not quite the right word.  Untoward may be better.    Perhaps you were conned into working for the dark side?   May I please have "Eclectic Catholic Warrior" as my flair?   when you would heal, did you just focus the energy on making them better?  or did you focus on the healing process of the specific ailment internally (for example, visualizing white blood cells in action, working in hyper speed).  I do the latter.    *thanks*  I firmly believe that if something needs to be done, for the good of the world, in one way or another, the powers that be will make that energy available to you.  It is lent, yes, but in that, you are a warrior in what I take you would call *their battle* , but it's our battle.    We are not puppets; we are active participants.  Puppets simply do as they are told.  By definition, we are far from that.    I am aware of hard effort it takes to become powerful; I am nowhere near where I would like to be.  But in a pinch, the energy from your adrenaline and urgency heightens your power dramatically, as do any other forces who want to see you succeed at the particular mission.   And I don't have to wonder; I know, my friend.  Faith is a powerful thing.  I am not a puppet.  I am a warrior.  (well, I was, and I would like to be again).    I've heard this story before, and I thought I remembered reading that they made an agreement to trade places (a la mode de Parent Trap), but I could just be misremembering that because it's what I would have wanted to hear.   yes, this is one of my favorites   wow; ok.  I don't even know where to start. I guess I'll just go down through the order you went in, and elaborate on things as I go.  Although I was already sort of interested, I was 12 when I formally began studying this stuff independently, so around the same age.   I can't speak to your experience with the mirror specifically, as I know nothing about that other than my dad told me that if you stare into the mirror long enough you will see who you were in a past life. I too have some really vague early memories, like the taking of my first portraits (as a baby).  One's vision is not fully developed at that point; all I know from the memory is that it was done by what I can determine was an old lady (although I certainly didn't know the meaning or vocabulary to interpret that at the time). I'm so sorry to hear about your childhood trauma.  Becoming empowered, if you will, had the opposite effect on me.  It's like I became a new person.  I had suffered from some anxiety issues in childhood, and, at that point, I learned to overcome them, with mental fortitude, and it's like my childhood before that was sealed off like a past life.  I remember major things and the general format of regular occurrences, like going to the mall with my mom, but not a lot of specific mundane memories.  Those are somehow locked away.    Dreams with premonitions are a perfectly normal part of life; some people just have them a lot more than others, if you are receptive to it, and if you sleep well enough to remember it.  Lately I haven't been sleeping well, but when I do, I remember my dreams every night, and have *psychic* ones at least once a week.  My most recent one predicted that I would have to go to the store with my mom to return a pack of socks.  But in the dream they were white socks; the real ones, the next day, were black socks.  So yes, of course, the signals you are subconsciously picking up on are never exact, because although, theoretically, the signal your mind is receiving and reading ought to be exact, it must pass though our mind and perceptual set (our lens of understanding), and be interpreted into language.  And I am totally familiar with the "THIS IS IT" moment.  I wouldn't describe it in quite the same way, but it feels great.   I am quite good at getting a feel for people's intentions/emotions, and I can complete sentences and such for people.  I don't have a deep empathic link like you described though; that is intense.  I have no connection to Buddhism, but meditating to channel energy is basically the first thing I learned how to do in this field.  As you surely already know, but may or may not have realized, the first thing one must be able to do is clear one's mind; think of absolutely nothing.   In my mind's eye, my energy is electric blue and sparkly.  My favorite color tbh.  I guess it resonates with me.  so greenish yellow (which is one of the colors that only a percentage of the population can see, thanks to having extra cones in the cornea) is evidently a color which resonate with you.   It's really cool that you met someone like Dakota.  I wish I had.  I taught some people some skills; my dad is into this stuff but I never could really talk to him about these things in more than a theoretical sense.  the director for a theater play I was in once, after I had read someone's mind and freaked them out because they somehow knew (I didn't do it as a parlor trick, I did it to guess a number to get a part in the intro scene we were adding), so she, the director, calmly talked about aborigine mental communication until he calmed down (like two minutes).    Enchanting objects is quite easy to do.  As with any "spell", if you will, it is all about channeling energy for intentions; simple as that.  One of the persons I was teaching was my ex, before we got together.  I'd taught him to do make a shield (like you described sealing the room sort of), and I could feel him extend it around me as he practiced it.  I didnt say anything, because, as we were just friends at the time, I didn't know how to react to such a personal trust; because that's almost like giving someone access to your soul; like, I'm protecting myself from any potential negative influences, but I feel no need to protect my mind and my soul from you.  I didnt say anything, but then he asked if I knew what he did, and I let him tell me before I said I knew, because, at the back of my mind, I didnt want to be wrong.    I hadn't been teaching him long when he enchanted an object, a hairbow, and gave it to me.  I didn't have to ask though; I knew exactly what he did.  It was a love spell.  The "legal" kind; the reminder/make you think of me kind.  I knew and I wore it anyways because it was sweet. I told him "I know what you did to this", and he just smiled.  your friend's ability to visibly see the energy and not just sense it is very special.  I had one friend who could visibly see auras (I think, or she could feel the color; one or the other).  I have yet to visibly see such things, but I can feel them, and visualize them in my mind's eye.  so, on that note, could Dakota see the color of the energy?  or just sense it?  People are socialized to not believe though.  I had an ex friend who I had started teaching, whom me enemies turned against me (yes mind control spells are a thing; she was the first I taught, and from then on, I learned to teach defense first, as I was describing about my ex).  Even if they've witnessed things, like how Dakota accurately described what you did, they can be convinced it wasn't real.  So watch out for that.  Do you still speak to Dakota?  Earth is my element; there's a story about how I know that as 100% fact (but I dont like dirt?, so it's strange).  I am quite impatient.  I have done "work" that involved a meditative state for more than 20 minutes, but to just focus energy for 20 minutes solid?  That I've never done.  I would like to though.  who knows what I could accomplish.  That being said; to make anything big happen, it is a fact I have found, and that a powerful wiccan I know (who I didn't find out was a wiccan until later) also happened to say, is that: *you have to need it* . One of the biggest things I've ever done, I did without waiting for a buildup of energy, because the energy came from the sheer force of dire need. (I can share that story too if you want).  The need however, lies with the person.  What is a dire need for you may not be a dire need for others.  If you can make yourself feel a dire need, then the power is yours.  That is hard to fake though.  I am still working on it (though not as much as I'd like to).  Energy manipulation has a young prime.  Once life responsibilities take over your mental energy, it is hard to do, unless you've kept it up continuously.  The biggest tip I can give you, especially to get the dreams back, is to get adequate sleep.  I have been staying up late lately, because I am studying abroad and have major FOMO (Fear of Missing Out) with my night owl friends.  But prior to that, I had been getting more sleep and thus, having more lucid and *psychic* dreams.  That last experience you mentioned though, specifically, I don't think that's earth energy.  That's electric, or weather.  Just pure energy really.  That's what lightning and thunder are.  Electricity.  Sheer force.  A force of nature. :)  So yeah; I could probably go on and on, but I hope this is helpful/ comforting, and feel free to AMA.    hmm.  that's kind of an iffy answer, but I think it confirms a ghost or presence of some sort if they're not going there as frequently but still going to that room, specifically to the window where one of the incidents occurred. I've never had a dog though, so I can't attest to the normality of such behavior, and individuals are different, so only you can make that judgement if this behavior is normal for your dogs.  It could be attributed to the stress of moving, and they may simply be doing it less because they got used to it.   there's no need to be "terrified".  To be honest, you and live with a ghost like that with no problem.  But, if you want to try and help it, then what you suggested is a good way to star; but don't ask for a name.  Go to one of the places you encountered it, and sit, relax, as if you were meditating, then try to get a feel for the presence.  If you can sense it there, try to reach out to it, by thinking really loud/hard "I mean you no harm.  Maybe I can help you.  who are you?  what do you need?"  If you can get any kind of response out of it, maybe you can figure out how to persuade it to move on.  But don't be pushy about it; that may just upset it.  Not 100% sure that you have a ghost though.  It could be electrical, as dogs can sense that too.  So, to clarify, when you say the things stopped happening after you asked, did the dogs also stop barking at the unseen?  that is the determining factor here.   As you and /u/EmpathyistheEnemy may be able to infer from the conversation in /r/paranormal earlier today, I too have a similar experience.  I was recruited at the age of 12 by my "guardian angel", who had been an attached spirit to me for as long as I could remember.   I had had experiences with malicious spirits in the past, most notably that one tried to kill me when I was about 5 years old; it was no accident.  Without having thought too much about it, I had managed to trap that spirit in a household item some time later.  My recruitment happened after I, 7 years later, accidentally released it because I had forgotten it was there.    The recruitment happened at night in my bedroom; the spirit, in the form of a scarlet macaw with the posture of a vulture, was glaring at me from atop my bookcase, and issued me a challenge.  With bravery I didn't yet know I had, I accepted the challenge, and it went away, for the time being.  Then my guardian angel told me that I didn't have to do it if I didn't want to; I accepted the responsibility.    So, I was recruited and my first mission was to defeat that spirit.   I never did any fighting irl that I didn't organize with ppl I recruited.  All other fighting was, as I said in my other post, with *psychic force* if you will.  I worked both alone and with a group, which were people I knew from school, but we didn't really talk in school, only outside of school.  I wouldn't call the battles OBE, but rather mind travel or something, which is achieved kind of like a deep meditation.  As far as doing things while "hunting", you are more powerful in a group because you can pool your energy and stretch it, but other than that, no not really.    Did you guys have rivals?  half of my fights were with rivals (also from school).  The other half were with entities.  I have faced off on ghosts, demons, something in between, and human rivals.  I gradually stepped back when I got with my ex, because my rivals, users of dark arts as they were, had befallen one of the people I recruited. I had started teaching my ex how to use his energy, starting with protection of course, and he had mastered things like shields.  But, I feared for his sanity, and compromising of my missions, should anything go after him while he was still not trained.  So, I stopped teaching him and stepped back from my duties, age of 15.  As such, my power greatly decreased.  But it is not gone.  I still have psychic dreams, and can feel auras when they're strong enough.  I can still do protection and healing spells.   I have full faith that if I needed to step up to the plate for something, that God would lend me the power necessary to do so.  I believe that I will be able to tap into it if necessary.  I want to rejoin the fight though; I am still young. I would also like to teach, if not to fight, at least teach people to be, as I call it, "masters of their own minds".     I've never recited anything in a language other than English.  Anything I need to know was simply made available to me.  I think of it as tapping into the knowledge that's out there; you could call it a universal consciousness, and ancient power source, or the energy of all the world's knowledge flowing in waves (sound, radio, etc), to which one can tune in.  As far as "spells" are concerned, it is simply a matter of intentions and directed energy.  There can be words, or not; you can use other's words, or your own.  That part doesn't matter.  There may be some high-level deep stuff that requires specific things, but I haven't come to that.  (did you use the term "hunting" because of Supernatural, btw?  one of the best shows ever.  I call them "battles" though.  Battles in the eternal fight of good vs. evil.)  As far as being confused about the intentions of the entities, as you mentioned in a reply above, where did you think your power was coming from?  Sure there's the base power you naturally have inside you, as a human being in God's image, functioning through electrical impulses, but the power used in battle is much stronger than that, particularly in spiritual battles.  So where did you think it came from?  (I apologize for my use of "God" if you're not Christian, but I, and I would think you also, given your experiences, believe that we all believe in the same God and just call him/her/it/the entity different things.)  Another question, besides the above asking if you had rivals, did you ever mange to do anything physical with your powers?  I know you said you had battles irl too (and the use of "irl" is not a good term; as Dumbledore famously put it "of course it is happening inside your head, Harry, but why on earth should that mean that it is not real"?  so I prefer to say mental and physical) So, I know you had battles in the physical world/realm, but did you ever, in or out of battle, do anything physical with psychic energy?  like move things? My ex did when he was a kid, which is why I had started teaching him.  I, a year after recruitment, managed a great feat of this type, but it was electrical-physical, not actually moving anything, but a power-surge if you will.  (I can tell the story if you're interested)  But, so did you?   anyone else notice that the capital letters in the last set of usernames say "Kill Bye"    I am not a skeptic, but it's clear to me that this is muckracking (gathering sparse examples into a weak case).  the chairs flipping can be wind, stray dogs, anything really.  The fridge opening by itself happens, as does with cabinets.  Pressure from the contents, the temperature, etc (especially if its an older fridge they don't close well).  Lights also act wierdly on their own, both incadesents and CFLs.  Noises like something fell but finding nothing happen in my house all the time.  I joke that there's a ghost, but I mean, it happens.  The tapping on your headboard is the creepiest, but I'm inclined to think nothing of it because the picture looks faked.  I mean, they say real blood looks fake to us because our mental concept of what blood looks like is based on fake tv blood.  So if its a real pic then, I'm sorry.   Giving you the benefit of the doubt, if it is real, sit calmly on your bed, relax and settle in as if to meditate, reach your mind out around the house, try to get a feel for the presense.  If you can sense it, try to contact it.  Just sense for it and think really hard/ loudly "I mean you no harm; I want to help you; what do you need?"  Try to find out what the issue is.  hope this helps.  edit: typos   and you can lift your spirit though meditation to a higher plane and travel as the spirits do (OBE), but that's a conversation for another day   yes, exactly.  In my case, it was personal, so it was most appropriate to personally show her the door.  In op's case, if it does turn out to be something like a racist great grandparent or something, it may come down to her bf talking the spirit down.  It will depend on the details of the situation.    define exorcism; because if you mean old church stuff, that won't necessarily fly.   If you loosely use "exorcism" to mean methods of getting rid of / vanquishing spirits, then yes that would be wise.   depending on how you look at it, everyone has "psychic powers", or you could say there is no such thing because it is normal, not a power.  We can all pick up on energy from eachother and things.  We all have the ability to sense each other's feelings or when something is amiss. Like antennae picking up on signals.  Some people just have stronger reception than others.  Knowing about it and being open to it helps you tune in more.  My experience with entities you can physically see is limited, but I have experience both with attached spirits and getting rid of negative spirits, but I accomplished that with brute (*psychic*) force.    I don't know if op is strong enough for that.  If she hasn't deliberately channeled the energy, then likely she isn't.    Ms.Medium sounds like she could help you /u/Brutally_honesttt .  Although I understand how she could sense the attached spirit and the aura, because that is just sensing and reading signals radiating from you, I dont know if she could help you fight off a nasty spirit.    I would offer to help, as you don't have to be physically present to get rid of a spirit, for obvious reasons, but you do have to know what you're dealing with.    In any case, you can try ignoring it as demonslayer suggested, but in case it doesnt stop/ gets worse, you need to try to find out what it is and what its deal is.  I don't think it'll try to hurt you with your *familiars* around, so keep them close.  Your bf may be vulnerable though, especially if he does have sleep problems; it would leave him in the vulnerability of sleep with the mobility of someone who is awake.  Worse case scenario with that: you wake up to him wearing that sadistic face choking you.  I don't mean to frighten you worse, but that is the worst case scenario as far as I can see.  Knowing that should help in the sense that you have less to fear if you know the worst you can expect.  Although, given that it probably let the dogs out, it can clearly do small movements of physical objects on its own.  If it wanted to hurt you though, at this point, it wouldn't do so by letting the dogs, who protect you, out.  It is just toying with you at this point.   The last spirit I got rid of for someone toyed with me before I even found out about its existence; she visited me in a dream and glared at me.  I later found out her story, realized that was her, and knowing who she was and what her beef was, which was personal (dead ex of my then bf), I was able to take her out.   If its some random spirit toying with you, it will get bored if you ignore it, yes. If it is someone who has a beef with you living in that house for any reason (there could be *any* reason), then it will work harder to drive you out.    So find out if there are any old stories related to the house, or any dead relatives who may have beef.  Hope this helps.  sorry I went on for so long...   The cat seems to be a good guy, in any case.  Although the bf most likely has a sleep issue, on the off chance that something worse is amiss, the last thing she'd want to do is remove the watchful alarm   I have false awakenings every now and then, but when I wake up for real, I have no trouble knowing the difference, that the first awakening was false.  In the dream, I only know its a false awakening about 50% of the time.  I dont have a particular test; I can usually just tell when something is a dream   I was thinking of that cat virus as soon as I read this headline.  This is yet another zombie-like infection IRL.  	41

 Well that's that. It is his building.   Hey I know this isn't a budget post, but just some rough advice. If I were you, I'd consider one of two options:  1) Move in with parents if they have room and allow it and put ALL available money towards the loans. Even if you are only making minimum wage, at 40 hours a week (and if your job isn't full time, get a second one), you should be earning $1100 after taxes per month. Live like a pauper on $200, and pay $900 a month towards the loans. Do this as long as you can.  2) Pick up and move to the oil fields in the Midwest or Texas, or go work on a fishing boat in Alaska. Yes it will suck and it's dangerous, but you'll clear $100K a year and have the loans paid back in 2 years.   Curiosity compels me to ask what exactly do you do as an independent contractor and how you were able to grow your income so fast.   What state, if you don't mind?   While I agree with the advice, there's almost zero possibility this person will agree to meet at a police station and suggesting so may spook them so that OP will never get the car back.  Why not meet in the store parking lot with a guy friend?   Red's Saloon. I just moved here too and its my go to Packer bar.   Just moved to San Diego in July and that's the bar I go to! (Although I didn't make it out tonight, so I'm not in the picture.)   No problemo! Glad to spread the knowledge! I was an econ major and did plenty of statistics studies in undergrad, so I can see it from your view.   I was hoping someone would catch that.   I'm betting you paid with a credit card, no? You can always do a chargeback with the CC company.  If I were you, I'd politely request a refund, minus some money for the work they have done already, and if they refuse do a chargeback, then negotiate with them for the amount of work done already.   Well my opinion is that that fact is mind blowing.   Wrong. Quoting from the article: "The fixed ratio of AS/H in our population was 1.02 for males versus 1.01 for females."  AS/H means arm span to height ratio. The ratios are virtually identically.  Here's your peer reviewed source written by Phd's in the field: http://m.erj.ersjournals.com/content/37/1/157.full   But they are heavily correlated and the average person has a wingspan equal to their height.   That just sucks so much for him. From Romil's point of view he spent 21 years completely alone just to die a couple hours later.   Yea. Here's the thing, this movie was what, 100-200 years in the future? I'll grant them that they have an artificial uterus that can house the eggs until birth, but then what? Anne Hathaway and the robot have take care for hundreds of babies? I mean even if that robot is 100% about the babies all day long, doesn't the ship only contain a few years worth of food? So Hathaway has to farmer the crap out of the planet for her and 500 other mouths and simultaneously raise all these babies into at least 10 year olds until they can start contributing. I don't envy the task.   Saw a theory in these comments that said something like: it was an alternate timeline where humans survived the first time around, but decided to set it up where this timeline's humans survived most likely b/c it is a better existence than theirs. It stands to reason that if the future humans could control the 5th dimension, they could control the alternate timeline.  It's not perfect logic, but it works for me.   Neither. They said in the movie that "them" was humans far, far in the future, like hundreds of thousands of years, that had evolved into being able to control the 5th dimension.   Marcus' reach is 4" longer, but he's 3" shorter. Weird.   Is THIS what's going on?  I raise my hand to ask and answer questions at least twice a class, and some people just seem to hate me.

What percentage of the population is open to torturing a child to death? 0.1%? I mean seriously, what are the odds they got together? Insanely low.   This.

I found Kim McQuilken, who went 5/26 with 43 yards, 0 TDs and 5 Ints. How the hell does he not get pulled earlier?!   That seems to be the consensus between other posters. Because if Romilly had gotten the robot properly working, he would have realized a all the supposed resources the planet had were nonexistent.   I too hated the paradox of future self giving info to past self causing him to become future self and it is the one thing I noticed in the film as someone with a modest to low knowledge of theoretical physics that just doesn't jive with any part of sound theory.  For the embryos part, I assumed they were scientifically advanced enough where they had artificial wombs to birth the children. Although it would still be a massive pain in the ass to care for all those babies.   Out of those movies , I have only seen Cloud Atlas so I can't speak to the others. In my opinion, Interstellar had the perfect recipe of tiptoeing just on the line of unbelievableness without crossing that line. I've yet to see a movie that placed itself above Interstellar in that respect.   It has a 71% rating mean that roughly 3/10 reviews say it is a bad movie overall. That fact is almost more mind blowing than the movie itself.   No way. I've seen all those and they don't compare at all. This too science fiction elements of several different kinds and blended them into a tale that stretches across about 90 years with significant portions at different points along the way. Further, it expands with physics to a point jusssst on the edge of unbelievable but theoretically sound enough for the average person.

And maters gonna mate   Or make election "day" 2 days long and everyone who works day 1 is not allowed to work day 2 and vice-versa.   I honestly believe he'd rather be playing. Do you not?   Ok. They willfully intoxicating themselves knowing it would vastly increase their risk of killing someone.   Completely agree with you. When someone beats their kid that bad and just doesn't see it as wrong, I feel like it is extremely hard to get them to turn their views around. I don't believe anything less than a couple years could make someone feel genuine remorse, especially not missing a few weeks of football.    I mean it's only child abuse, right?   People that drive drunk don't intend to hurt anyone, but sometimes they kill people. Apply the same logic.   Here's a fun comic on entrapment. Kinda long, but you'll know entrapment pretty well if you make it to the end.  http://thecriminallawyer.tumblr.com/post/19810672629/12-i-was-entrapped   First file a claim with your insurance for the accident.  Second, do you have a lawyer helping with the lawsuit? If so, he can probably best answer your question. If not, just be honest in court and tell them everything.   If they haven't been paying their loan for 2 years, then this isn't "out of nowhere." In fact, that's about the longest a bank will go without payment before starting foreclosure proceedings.  In short, they've been duped by this "negotiator." While he may help some people, a bank WANTS people to pay the loan. They will help you go through modification to a certain extent, usually. Rarely, does a person need a negotiator to talk to the bank for them. If the bank wouldn't negotiate after a year of non-payment, it seems they would never negotiate, which is exactly what happened here.  Here's some food for thought. How long have they owned the home? More than 10 years? It's likely the bank would LOVE for the family to stop paying and foreclose on the house at that point. I'm gonna make up some numbers: Lets say they bought the house for $100K, taking a loan for $90K After 15 years, they only owe $60K Meanwhile, the house is appreciating 4% per year and is now worth $180K  In that scenario, and the numbers in real life might be worse or better for your boyfriend's family, the bank would be able to sell the home and PROFIT $120K. They would be insane to renegotiate any loan when they could profit by letting the home go to foreclosure. I'm strongly suspecting something like that is what's taking place here, and is the reason the bank refuses to renegotiate.    /u/hansSA is right. You need couples counseling. Here's the thing: you're in denial over your husband meeting a man for a gay relationship on match. That's understandable in this situation. What would never fly in any situation would be if I asked my SO to go to counseling because I perceived a problem in our relationship that I thought required professional help and my SO refused to go to counseling. Right then would be the time that I would look to get out of the relationship, because at that point I would know the person does not care about your feelings in the relationship.   Suggest couples counseling, and if he refuses, I would start looking for an out if I were you.   I would 100% mention that you do not live in the US and do not intend to return. That is the only leverage you have, because otherwise they will just wage garnish like they do with all the others.     Since it is legal, and the original owner has no recourse, everyone should tweet/email/FB Spirit about how shitty they are for stealing this person's idea.   Thanks!   So I've read all the comments and I'm still not sure who the fighter is.   Oh gotcha. I see the argument both ways. Seems like the UFC and any other media need to define p4p next to the ranking.   Can you expand on your second definition? You just repeated "pound for pound."   "Yea, this will make us look real tough! Let's shove our fingers in their butts!"  I sincerely don't understand the logic sometimes.   Or repeat business if he just seals the cat in again!   Can you go to a therapist or perhaps have one come to you if you are unable to leave the house? You could do some therapy with the boyfriend and ultimately tell him with the therapist there. He would have someone to tell him "yes this is real and its not going to change" and also help him deal with his feelings on the matter.   Chael vs Vitor  I know people like to hate on Chael, but he's my guilty pleasure.  I thought he could wrestle Vitor and with it, I'm sure he would have gotten a title shot. I just want him to get the title he promised his dad he would get. (tear)   Could be any number of reasons. Maybe the suicidal man came to the window and pointed the gun at them and SWAT was outside the whole time.   Lots of times these kinds of waivers will not hold up in court. If there was a case of actual negligence you can still sue.   In bankruptcy, in most cases the court cannot take your house, or car.   They have been stripped of their firearms and are on suspension. It says it right in the article. It's standard procedure for any officer involved in a shooting.   I did that in middle school then they banned it. So I just had to be more sneaky ;)   Maybe it reflects upon them. But I would never assume the actions of an individual were with bad intentions merely because they belonged to a government organization where there had been stories of unlawful actions before.  You guys are literally assuming these guys are guilty until proven innocent. That's not how a society should operate.   Let's put you in that scenario. You're on the SWAT team that responded and the suicidal guy points a gun at you. Do you fire?  I would argue that any cop in that situation has "no choice" but to fire at the man.   The fact that you're referring to it's only what you've seen is the very definition of anecdotal evidence and therefore no air quotes are needed.   So you're going with the assumption that they are guilty until proven innocent, just to be clear?   I said "So are you just comfortable judging **this** SWAT team..." and you answered "Basically yeah..." and now you say "I wasn't specifying this SWAT team..."  You're backing out and spewing some good ol' fashioned cop hating, when all I'm doing is reiterating the point that none of us know the true facts and we shouldn't based our opinions of **this specific case** on a news report that doesn't give us the full story of what happened.  You have some good points, but your blanket hatred of all cops seem to have clouded your judgement.   These exact people on this SWAT team?   You don't know that these specific people on this SWAT team have done anything, unless you know something more than the rest of us.   Well I hope you never sit on a jury in that case.   I just don't understand how this is a rebuttal to Dolce. I think BJ had an off night and could have performed better. The fact that Dolce thinks he had amazing conditioning and was beating up the guys they brought in has nothing to do with that and why BJ blames Dolce for his loss blows my mind.   So are you just comfortable judging this SWAT team based on your preconceived notions with absolutely zero evidence?   Your story is nothing more than anecdotal evidence. It does not show it reflects the intentions of SWAT teams elsewhere.  Here, we don't have the full story. It is entirely possible the suicidal man got frustrated and aimed his gun at police who at that point would have no choice but to shoot him. Or its entirely possible something much like the scenario you described played out and they killed the guy on purpose.   I don't understand how people pick split decisions. Are you deciding the judges will suck? Or just that there will be a round that is a legitimate 100% toss up round?  If it's just close rounds then you'd pick the winner of the majority, no?   Aldo. Listen I'm not crazy, I know Aldo gasses. I know when he gasses he is susceptible to getting laid on (Hominick). I figure he'll stuff some TD's, maybe get taken down once or twice in the first two rounds but pop up soon enough where it doesn't count against him too much, and outstrike Mendes through the first 3 rounds to take them by a close margin, then get laid on for 4 and 5 but not finished from the bottom. 48-47 Aldo   I like how it took him 15 minutes to think of that last reply. Like he kept thinking of a follow up, but would erase it over and over thinking "no, that's not good enough" and THAT'S what he settled on??   I'm not saying it's not possible but just be aware that there is a remote chance he was the beneficiary of a trust or his wife is or they won a small lottery, have a rich uncle or any other possibility.   Could the kid not wash it off themselves?   What was Rumble's deal? I remember Dana saying he was in danger of being permanently banned and I remember it was for what I thought was BS but I don't remember the specifics.   Before anybody bitches about it, the grammar in the title is correct.      I really thought that was going to end with "gay." Not that the premise would necessarily line up with the conclusion, but damn it just fits.   That ending. He was SO close to getting out.   It's quite possible he has a wealthy spouse or a trust fund or any number of other things. Just because someone's job has them making less money than they're spending does not always mean they are corrupt.  Have you considered that maybe since he's home by 2 every day that he's putting his time to good use and running a successful online business or something similar?   Wait, why?   Is this true? Can you cite a law, either Federal or state?  I just moved to California and nearly every single business here asks to see my ID when I pay with a credit card.   The first step would be talking to other employees and getting them to go with you to talk to a lawyer about the matter. Most likely, the other side will get audited by an independent accountant who will calculate the damages.   Of course, it's happening right now. China claims Taiwan, but many regulatory bodies recognize Taiwan as its own state and Taiwan did not win a war over China to gain independence.   Yep.   Thank you for taking the time to answer!   Disagree again. What if the UN and every other country in the world recognizes the new country but the host country refuses to go to war with the new country. In that case would you recognize that a Declaration would be a legal document?   I might be misunderstanding myfunnynamewastaken's question, but I think he's asking how one would know if they truly don't want to be an attorney whatsoever or if they're just having 1L blues.   Another 1L here: So does the lawyer for one side say the evidence is prima facie, then the other lawyer can rebut it and it's no longer prima facie?   What about nations that just declare their independence and do not go to war with their former host country?   ALL law was created at one point or another by its own institutions. You say emancipation is a legal process. The courts who made it a law gave itself that power. That is my argument for why the Declaration was a legal document.  Also, I never said anyone could reference the Declaration, only that    I guess we'll just have to disagree. I think one country formally declaring they are no longer part of another is inherently a legal procedure.  I would liken it to a minor declaring independence from a parent by emancipation, which I don't think you would disagree is a legal procedure.   My mistake on the source, however the Declaration most certainly is a legal document. It is breaking off connection from another country's rule.   Well I was just going by what the founding fathers defined as rights.   I completely disagree. Sweden doesn't have MORE of a right, they just have less chance of their right being taken away, an important distinction.  Nonetheless, for your Colorado example, the Constitution doesn't guarantee the degree of a right, only that there is that right.   Yes, there is a "right to life" even if we have the death penalty. I am arguing that the govt can validly take away rights. It's the user I was replying to that is arguing otherwise.   No, both are ok. I'm not arguing either is not ok. The power to veto is a check on power and is the very essence of our democracy, as is the power to filibuster.   Obama would never let that happen. He can manufacture a trillion dollar coin, simply order the debt payments continue as a matter of national security, or any number of other scenarios. Also the Republicans took a beating in the polls last time they pulled that stunt, and seem unlikely to try again.  Also, can you give me a source on him saying they would default if they won the Senate? I had not heard that.   No. How could it be?   Dana does, and he watches it the whole fight. You see it in a lot of his vlogs.   I guess the moral is, most challengers think you gotta have something extra up your sleeve if you wanna beat the best.   That's not true. There is a right to life, which can be taken away by the death penalty. There is a right to liberty, which can be taken away via a prison sentence. And there is a right to property, which can be taken away via seizure or eminent domain.  Were you thinking those weren't rights or that we shouldn't be able to have any of them taken away?  	104

 "I feel okay about feeding my child McDonald's now, because books!"   This is so terrible, I'm tearing up.    I don't know how to do any of that   I lived with an Asian family the first semester that I transferred to my university. It was weird, so I decided to join a club so I could branch out and meet new people. Turns out that after the first semester, one of my club-mates asked me to move into his 5 bedroom house. Life was good after that.  Then I joined a fraternity and made like a million more friends.   My open palm.   I'm from Southern California and confused about all that white stuff on the ground behind you.      These are so annoying   I want to eat it. It looks like delicious marzipan candy.      I would sign a blood contract and pledge to you my first born.    Your parents are related.      You really couldn't walk a flight of stairs to go pee? You are so lazy!   Kill Bill: Instead of a story of revenge, it a really sadistic story about a man stalking his ex lover, killing all of her friends and family in order to find her and kill her.  Sounds more like a horror film than a kung-fu movie.   Its NYE and everyone in the office is pretending to work.   I fell in love and out of love and that gap in between is what I remember the most.    Whatever movie that made Nicholas Cage famous.   When you're pooping in a stall next to somebody.    Your taste in music.    Her  I was in awe once the film ended and all of my friends hated it. They literally laughed the entire car ride home about how stupid it was, which almost ruined it for me.   	21

 Couldn't agree more. The gunners in the US are killing this amendment by defending the current abysmal regulations situation; if, after a child is murdered in a massacre with a gun at school, the NRA folks came out with humanity and attempted to fix the loopholes and prevent such tragedies, I think people (me included) would relax . But instead they get more vicious; the things said to the parents of Sandy Hook victims were FUCKED.       We'll find that old Super 8 footage, you won't be able to Dodge_It.   Sounds like a Lisa Frank bomb went off   Those are special saws, right?       Purple monkey dishwasher Pizza! My Favorite!                I've seen an upswing in shitty druggies (=meth) in my neighborhood and they seem to work in the oil fields. A neighbor rented a room to a young guy from the oil fields and the guy got arrested, and them my neighbor found a shitload of heroin packages in the guys room. Shady. As. Fuck. Hate that this element is growing here.       We are changing that shit. We lost 30 Americans a day to gun violence last year. That's a fucking plague.    In 2013 we lost 30 Americans a day to gun violence. That's a crisis.   http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/jan/31/president-obama-gun-control-push  Edit: ***thanks*** for my first gold! I'm so used to being derided for speaking out.       As part of their investigation, police will try to trace the gun using an existing serial number, Friedman noted, but the most likely explanation for Zehaf Bibeaus possession of the gun is that he purchased it on the black market or stole it from its original owner. If its the latter, the legal owner could face charges if he or she knew the gun had been taken and failed to report it to police.      Similarly we need a discussion about access to firearms without people immediately shutting down their brains decrying "personal freedom infringement". If someone has their passport taken away, and then voila has a firearm and bullets, the FIRST QUESTION should be how? Where did he get them? Track that shit and we'll stop this plague of gun violence. Track Every Gun and Track Every Bullet.    As well as a good number that join the KKK, the NRA and other extremist groups in North America.    What's the legality of a threat on the president?                         Though it's hard to be surprised by the gunners anymore, it does shock me that they are so shitty to Gabby Giffords. Her husband is an astronaut and she is a public servant. The gunners are fucking scum. When I think back to my childhood during the Reagan years I can't fathom anyone being given a mic to talk shit about someone in government who was shot in the face by someone who never should have been able to access a gun, and then tried to prevent it from happening to someone else.          I'm afraid this will become more common, as many yoga instructors seem to have gone from Teaching *yoga*, to Teacher Training on high-speed. It seems like a diploma-mill situation, where the teacher trainings bring in more money than classes, so teachers ALL seem to offer them, and then turn out new teachers like crazy. Odds are, even if most new instructors are good ones, we will end up with more and more freaks. OP, your instructor sounds like s/he's got a tin ear.    Please contact Lt. Jeff Manning of the Gilchrist County Sheriffs Office at (352) 463-3491 or Jmanning@gcso.us. Tell him you are terribly sorry that his community has had to endure this terrible tragedy. And then ask him if the .45-caliber handgun used by Don Spirit has been traced, and if it has been, where it was traced to. Spirit was a convicted felon who could not have passed a background check.      Brought him to his knees!   I think if the women in my family farted openly and laughed we might all be happier. Can we blame hidden farting on puritans?    Bravo!                ...probably by a priest.             Using an old book to persuade nuts that their interpretation of the book (which they consider magic) is wrong seems like the wrong approach. Like a scientist debating a creationist. If someone is not operating in reality it's pointless to use reason on them.                Yes it is. The /r/guncontrol subreddit actually had to post instructions about how to see new posts because of the ammosexual down vote brigade. Fucking blood on their hands.                   This is why I support the gun control measures with my votes and my money, but I don't go to rallies or put myself in the line of fire. These so-called Open Carry groups are trigger-happy loons, our domestic terrorists.  Until this recent spate of killings and open-carry demonstrations I was not for "taking their guns" - now, I am fully for it. Remove the guns from these fucks.    This is why weapons like guns are terrible for beings like humans.          Even those of us who got internet in our late teens are mostly NOT prude. The ones who are seem to be this weird Reagan spawn that came as a rejection of progress.    Fuck!   Take our gun nuts too please.  USA                                             Absurd. Hope a lawsuit is swift in following this BS. Incredibly tired of the religious oppression of reason in our America.

They're at home getting pedicures from the Koch Brothers and blow jobs from the NRA.    Aw shit. I was tying my shoe and my wife was eating oatmeal and both our guns accidentally went off. Oops!         A recent survey found U.S. law enforcement agencies considered sovereign citizens to be the top terrorist threat they faced.                  Right? And if a kid is murdered in kindergarten, or worse, a whole classroom full, we damned well better see protestors outside gun shops. Those are the death stores. Killing ALREADY ALIVE people everywhere.    The thing is, cars also transport people and can be used in ways that help lives. Guns only kill.    We don't! Let's close gun stores everywhere.    They do. With their childrens blood.   	100
 I know it wasn't, but I like to think that effect was accidental.    Lorenzo Music voices the cat or no go.      Until Nikolaj Coster-Waldau sat on it and patted his thigh at her.    A drone, probably.    The theme being "this looks kinda cool."             Steal from the best, I guess.  Plus they already borrowed a lot from The Conspiracy Against the Human Race: http://www.vox.com/2014/8/7/5975769/true-detective-a-work-of-plagiarism-a-guide    I saw one of those Pony Simulator comics I mentioned in the OP.     http://listverse.com/2014/10/30/10-of-the-most-terrifying-creepypasta-about-stalkers-and-intruders/  Some lesser known entries in this one.

No, it's not okay just because you have a tortoise friend!    To my mind "Salad Fingers" was boring as hell because it was badly animated and had some lousy artwork, so it just seemed predictable that he'd go with creepy or whatever since it gave the impression he wouldn't be able to draw anything else. It was that or just have everyone say fuck or do the kind of juvenile humor that would appeal to Newgrounds people.    Then those terrible characters came in and ruined it.    ... But it's Halloween, so which of the ponies would you most like to pet?

He won't. It's a miracle he's bothering with visuals at all. Probably wishes he could just make it another podcast.       I love the cool strut the woman in the yellow shirt is doing while it happens.    I think people were impressed by the fact the author did a good imitation of Jane Austen's writing style for the portions he added to Pride and Prejudice that pertain to zombies.

We do our own research. Yeah, I've had a few mistakes pointed out to me and I've sent e-mails to editorial to have them corrected. For what it's worth, editorial doesn't allow us to cite wikipedia any more.       Ah, but the movie V/H/S 2 showed us where this goes!      I thought this one was pretty good: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyLI1UkTQVM      I love my job except when I work in the kid's section because I don't like working with shelves of kid's books.    I'm a fan, I just don't like the kid's section.    Looking forward to it? High hopes? Pessimism? Indifference?    His work got a C   D order for being too off model.    I work at a library and love the hell out of my job. EXCEPT when I have to work the kid's section, because the books are so skinny and the shelves always so out of order that it takes forever to shelve anything.   Today we got a big delivery of MLP books. A couple other librarians were talking about it, marveling about how they couldn't keep them on the shelves. One mentioned she saw this thing about how she learned there is non-pony MLP fanart (like when the Mane Six are drawn as donuts or whatever) and wondered aloud what else there might be. I  said "if it's a noun, there's a My Little version of it." And she was quiet for a second and then said "ARE YOU A BRONY!?" I said "not so loud."   I thought then "Ah ha! Now she'll find me creepy and not let me work in the kid's section, but probably not enough to fire me!" I thought I was free of my least favorite part of my job. Then she said "I love you even more now!"   Dammit! The ONE time I wanted it to make me look like I shouldn't be around kids!        Good lord do those look creepy            Knowing that she's not having sex with another guy but knowing she's not interested in me either.    I would way rather be ignored by someone that receive an abusive message, so I'd definitely prefer option B.    Oh, I dunno.

I interacted with them casually for a few weeks at least, then usually I say "hey, you want to go out sometime?"

Sounds like the sadder thing is that you're approaching it with that attitude.          http://listverse.com/2014/10/24/10-excruciating-days-inside-the-battle-of-the-yser/  I know it sounds like just a listicle, but there's substance to it.     I'm on rejection like nine of people I've asked out. All the times I didn't bother have just blurred together or been forgotten, but I remember all the rejections pretty vividly. That's not counting all the online ones but those don't really count. I really shouldn't have tried with the person I now see regularly at work, although I don't know if it's still awkward for her since possibly she doesn't remember.   But I've got a job I love so I really can't complain.      FUCK no I wouldn't want to be a woman! Last thing I need is to have menstruation, body issues, and misogyny to deal with.    I'm a really flaky guy to help balance it out.    Thank you!   Is that a reference to stereotypical French snootiness or something?    I didn't reminisce about my childhood at all.

Anyway, the manual said it was a problem with the vents in the back around the fan getting clogged. I pulled the fridge from the wall, removed the vent cover, and saw that the fan was surrounded with dust and hair. I cleaned it out. I might not have noticed the moss then, but I was so bored at the time that I decided to clean it much more thoroughly than necessary. I felt along the bottom of the metal frame housing the fan and then recoiled. I thought Id electrocuted myself for a second, but I knew that what Id felt was not electricity from past experience with hotwiring.  I felt it again. It was smooth, warm, and soft. It was quite similar to human flesh. And there was something else about the thing I felt down there that differentiated it from any known mold.  There was a pulse like you can feel at someones neck or wrist. Id felt pulses enough back in the day that it was the first place my mind went when I felt that sensation. And along with it, I felt a very light spray emit from it, like if you squirted cologne on yourself from way too far away.  I tried to tear it out and get a look at it, but it was too firmly attached. Frustrated, I went and got some drain cleaner which dissolved the patch quickly. When I cleaned out the remnants it a red sludge. It was just like the leftovers from when I and my associates used lye on a body.  Like many things in my life I was able to rationalize that pretty easily. There were probably plenty of molds I wouldnt recognize. I knew I had seen red funguses somewhere on television or something. The pulse could have been my own. If you use your thumb when taking someones pulse, youll end up feeling your own. I convinced myself Id felt something similar to that.  Badum. Badum. Badum. Badum. Badum.  Taking off the gloves after the last of the sludge went down the sink, I realized I hadnt washed my hand before putting on the glove after I felt that faint spray. I absent-mindedly sniffed it weakly. It smelled surprisingly good. Like chocolate and flowers. Of course I washed it off, but I was surprised at the time that it smelled so nice. In fact, I felt a little happier than I would have expected after washing it off.  Early the next morning, when there was just enough light to make the inside of my cabin a dark blue, I heard the fan for the fridge again make a horrible grinding noise. I stumbled out of bed, pulled the fridge away from the wall again, unplugged it, and then I froze. I could smell chocolate and flowers.  I thought I might have been smelling things and maybe seeing things through bleary eyes. A glass of water sounded like what I needed to clear my head. I drank half a glass then poured the rest out. Although I couldnt see into the sink properly in the weak light, I realized there was no gurgle of the water draining. I turned on the light above the sink and saw it.  There was a mass that had grown out of the drain. It was slowly, rhythmically expanding and contracting slightly like it was breathing. A large blue vein was visible, straining against the skin.  I bent down to get the drain cleaner. My hands were trembling as I tried to unscrew the lid. Even then, I knew it was useless. What I had done yesterday had merely left this thing to regrow in the u-pipe or somewhere. Surely pouring more drain cleaner onto an even greater mass would hardly stop the growth. But it was all I could think to do at the moment.  As I poured a bit of drain cleaner onto the moss, its surface spasmed. It released a powerful spray of whatever that scent was. I couldnt force myself to keep pouring. I was became fully relaxed even as I stood there trying to kill some being of skin. The moss gradually stopped spasming even as the drain cleaner slowly stopped eating through it. It seemed, at least to me, like it was relaxing too. It released more of that wonderful scent.  Badum. Badum. Badum. Badum.  Its okay. I understand. Im not mad at you. Thats what it felt like it was trying to communicate to me. Even then I knew I should have tried to tear out the plumbing or leave the cabin for somewhere else on foot, but I wanted more of that scent. I felt the best I had since Id started hiding up here.  I stood over the sink for a while, just breathing in that odor. I could no longer care what was in that spray which calmed me so. I looked over at the fridge vent. I could see little bits of the flesh moss growing out through the vents.  Since then, the moss grew and grew faster as it went. It now coats the inside of the cabin like soundproofing, For how loud it is, the sound of the mosss pulse is very relaxing, like the nature sounds people play to help them sleep. Its the badum sound Ive found myself typing a few times as I write this. I imitate the sound with my mouth as I do.  Acid is beginning to leak from large pores on this flesh moss. Its not strong enough to eat through metal but anything organic that it touches is being dissolved. The soles of my boots are almost gone now. I can feel the skin on the bottom of my feet beginning to be eaten away as well. But what matters most is that the moss has continued to spray that wonderful scent even as it releases acid. Im in pain, yet I dont mind.  The mosss pulse is speeding up. I think it wants to digest me faster. I am considering lying down in the acid to help speed it along. Its the least I could do for it.  Badum, badum, badum badum badum badum badumbadumbadumbadumbadumba     I'm legitimately beginning to think of tiny, unoriginal horror shorts like these as "twist porn." It's not scary, it's not believable, it's only supposed to be interesting because it's ostensibly surprising.    http://listverse.com/2014/10/14/10-of-the-strangest-things-beetles-can-do/  I have no idea why he went for specifically beetles instead of insects in general, but whatever.    Huh. I thought they'd require a W-2, paystub, or somethin, but alright.    I was paid for this other small gigs through paypal. What paperwork would I need claiming that other pay?    But why design it so it seems like he's looking over my shoulder instead of at me?          Clearly a shared universe. Be ready for plenty of surprise cameos!   Let me guess: It's the story where there's a doppelganger under the bed.          I heard from an industry insider that Richard Williams was threatening to miss his deadlines on Who Framed Roger Rabbit and at the end he was effectively fired but had handed the animation long enough (plus Union rules) that he got the Oscar anyway. Anyone know if that's true?    Yes, it's very obvious what the premise of the original strip is. My point was that the bonus panel didn't put a humorous spin on it or anything.    Moments in movies where a camera movement or the way a scene was lit  made you laugh.   One moment that comes to mind for me was Tropic Thunder.  SPOILERS  Ben Stiller's character is taken hostage and forced to sort of perform as his character Simple Jack. He is put in a humiliating outfit and constantly beaten to do so. When his rescuers arrive, he says he doesn't want to leave because he's finally found his audience. When he says that, there's a shot of him where there's a light on his face that makes him look kind of movie menacing. It was hilarious to me the contrast between his slapstick treatment and how now he was feeling empowered and menacing.    By contrast, I just saw a kid kicking a dragon puppet in the library and was  unwilling to do anything. He might still be at it for all I know.    Wow, there's no joke. Just self-hatred.    "Purposely put the trailer?" How would he do that accidentally?       Edited OP to clarify question.    I have a really dumb one: when I was like seven or so I watched this movie called Jingle All the Way where Arnold Schwarzenegger plays a busy dad who tries desperately to get his kid a toy. I must have bought way too much into the idea that the dad was neglectful, because there's a scene where Schwarzenegger has to pick his kid from out of a crowd to give him a toy, and I seriously worried "Oh no, is Schwarzenegger going to be able to remember his kid's *name*?!" That or I was weird as hell.     What's something where later thinking about a movie, you found yourself saying or thinking "I thought _________!" and couldn't believe it later?   Is this a reference?    I really didn't get that. Isn't that going to make them enormously more expensive and risky, going to clash with your expectations, make it harder to sell the special effects, etc. When your target audience is usually kids or nostalgic adults anyway, wouldn't you assume they'd prefer the look of a cartoon if the cartoons became classics anyway?   Sure, it paid off a few times like when movies like George of the Jungle became hits, but it seems like the risks and bombs would outweigh that.    EDIT: I mean, why, if you're going to reboot a franchise, would you adapt it live action instead of as a cartoon? I should have clarified that more. I certainly get the nostalgia aspect.    I move around and change identities.   Just imagine how unpleasant it would be to think you would be immortal your whole life well into like your thirties, and then to find out you weren't because you just got diagnosed as terminal.          Ah, but inimitable by children, so they'll allow it.

She never seemed to pass up an opportunity to buy a new book or dvd by Joyce Meyer or some other self-help huckster who would tell her what she wanted to hear about needing to stop worrying and put her faith in God. I tried to convince her that God as a concept was irrational, that her religion was built on lies and bad ethics.   That stopped yesterday.   Mom called me up out of the blue and pleaded for me to come over. When I arrived, I let myself in and saw she had taken everything Christian she owned, from bibles to plates with The Last Supper on them, broken it all, and assembled it all into a cross in the middle of the living room. There was blood drying on some of the broken glass.   Mom, what is this?! .   Dustin, she called from her bedroom, I need you to pray! I was getting out my phone to get an ambulance while jogging to her bedroom. The door was locked.   Unlock this door, Mother!   Pray!  Really, truly, pray! She screeched at me. I paused and whispered a prayer that Mom be okay. I have never regretted doing anything more in my life. I have never felt secure, alone, or hopeful since then.  There was a voice that reverberated from inside my head while I stood outside her room.   *Be not afraid, but I bring you dark tidings.*       These images have clearly been doctered.    So, those are different subsections in the aisle?   I don't want to think about the difference between a MLP toy and something that's specifically a Brony toy.     What's that from?    So they couldn't get the guy that played Vern Schillinger for this photo?    Let's hope it doesn't have the same infuriating ethically blinkered ending that Close Encounters does.    http://listverse.com/2014/09/30/10-bizarre-ways-murderers-screwed-up/  I'm sure we've all heard about Dennis Rader by now, but I hadn't known that was how Ed Gein was caught.    Okay, fixed.    Up there,   there is so much room,   looking down on Sweetie Belle and Apple Bloom,   I wouldn't have to fear Fluttershy's stare,   up there!    You... really don't want to know what Rarity is doing under that helmet.    A. A Christian is drowning in the sea. A boat comes up the crew tries to save them, but he says "no, God will save me!" Later another boat comes up and tries to save him again, but he insists that God will save him. Later a third boat comes along. The Christian is wheezing, gasping, almost exhausted, but manages to wheeze out "no, God will save me!" Then he drowns. In Heaven, he asks God why he didn't save him. God says "I sent you three boats!"   B. An atheist is drowning in the sea. Getting desperate, he says to himself "Okay, God, I know I've never believed in you before, but if you save me, I'll not only become a believer, I'll become the best believer. I'll go to church, do my best to never sin. Please save me." Then a boat suddenly appears out of nowhere with a crew getting their life saving equipment ready. The atheist says "Never mind, God: I got this!"    Okay, is the appeal here supposed to be sadistic glee that someone gets to annoy a person professionally obligated to tolerate them? Like, is this porn for douchebags who wish they weren't too cowardly to personally treat people in this shitty manner?    I finally saw this film and I couldn't believe how forced and overwritten some of the dialogue was. Like "fuck me gently with a chainsaw" roles terribly off the character's tongue when just "fuck me gently" would have been so much more natural and quotable.   Did the screenwriter ever claim that the dialogue was supposed to be like some sort of satire of kids trying to sound cool? Is there any indication the lines were supposed to be legitimately cool? Dean is clearly supposed to be a deconstruction of the idea of being cool and edgy, so I thought the idea was kinda legit.    John Landis supposedly doesn't like it either. But apparently George Romero is fine with it for his movies since when he first watches movies it's either through an eyepiece or through a monitor, so technically all movies are directed on a basis of being made for television.    Is the chickenbutt thing really a joke though? I think of it more as a Dadaist commentary on language.    I understand most people would probably assume that they are having a sensory problem of some sort, but you would not believe under any circumstances that it's God communicating with you, right?       Pretty much just on the show.    This might be a private hangup, but I enjoy the visual design of the show so much that even when curtains are torn up or vases are broken it kinda peeves me a little. Yes I admit it would completely ruin it even as a kid's show if nothing could be wrecked or damaged, but I still don't like it.    So, is it funnier than the first one or better animated?    She learned how to hot wire the Twinkling balloon long ago.       Grrr... We hate Adventure Time!!  (Right?)    To be fair, knowing Arthur Conan Doyle's spiritualist beliefs, he probably didn't care too much about the real laws of physics anyway.    Oh alright, I'll give them another chance. Thanks for the thought.    Source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygyD9jQxQ7Y   God, that original ending would have made it my favorite movie of the year.       Awesome! I love mods.       A lot of my favorite ones still seem intact, like the ones about The Other Side of Midnight being used to persuade theaters to screen the movie or the special effects department only producing one usable shot after one year.    I recently tried How Did This Get Made? and hated it because they seemed to make the same jokes over and over (i.e. a character's autistic if the character's underacted, one of the hosts will say he jerks off to something, etc.) and the podcast We Hate Movies for the same reason (they constantly say "who gives a shit" and any adult that interacts with a child is a predator no matter what.)   So, what are some good alternatives?       He went to the school of hard knockoffs.    It actually was kind of bad voice acting. Some of her word emphasis was so unnatural that it was uncomfortable.    This is so well animated that it's annoying how awkward some of Fluttershy's dialogue is written and delivered and how the humor needed work.       Just lower your standards. It's gotta work eventually.    As a free-spirited student who's too cool for school, I say yes.    Normal.       It probably wouldn't be so slowly paced with lingering shots on uninteresting bits and ends in Spencer's room, so it'd have to be a step up (I like Eraserhead, but I imagine most people's biggest problem with it is the pace.)    Bet they went there right out of their parents' basements.    An image of a police officer not being portrayed as Satan got upvoted? How'd that happen?    If so, how did you react? Did you immediately get resent the manipulation? Did you not care?        Nah, it's genuinely clever and witty IMO. But then, I am a psycho hillbilly.    She might as well claim it's a parody so that she can publish it with fair use protection.       Exact opposite for me. My elementary school experience sucked because my parents had way more money troubles then, fought more, and my mildly abusive brother lived with us.   Foreveralone doesn't seem so bad sometimes.       So this is funny because he claimed to be drunk?   I would not. Science kinda has my back on that one: http://www.forbes.com/sites/olgakhazan/2011/09/12/is-listening-to-audio-books-really-the-same-as-reading/    http://listverse.com/2014/09/25/10-movies-sabotaged-by-their-own-creators/  Few novel stories in there, a few which are kinda samey. I think the one for Un Chien Andalous is the most interesting but don't watch the clip unless you're already kinda jaded.    Probably novelty value. If it didn't look weird and/or creepy, we wouldn't be talking about it.    Being a sociopath doesn't mean you're cool as a cucumber under pressure or don't have a sense of self-preservation.   That said, Dahmer had supposedly been living a lie pretty much his whole life by then, so he probably thought he knew how to handle it.         The joke was that Pratchett's anger would drive him to just spitefully kill off the cast of his greatest success.       CGP Grey rambled on his podcast recently about how in his opinion the ideal way to go into a movie was completely cold. Like, discovering it at home, comfortable on the couch, coasting through Netflix recommendations, not even reading the summaries.   	162

I grew up in NW Ohio where all the towns were small (~1,200 people) and the price of pizza is around what you are saying.

My brother and I were wathcing an episodes of King of the Hill last night and he brought up the fact that he couldn't think of a single episode where there wasn't at least one alcoholic beverage (usually beers in the alley) drank.  He's more of a fan than I am of the show, but I was trying to think of one as well and could come up with an episode.  Anyone know if there is a way to verify something like this?

 Ugh, this is too real. I sleep on an air mattress with only a snuggie for a blanket. So I'm low to the ground and barely covered, and the other night I woke up at like 2am and my blanket was hanging over the back of my desk chair. Long story short I was very cold for the rest of the night.  	1
 They eat krill in the wild. It tastes salty and without much umami flavor. But as they swallow them whole, the taste is not that important anyway.   How did you come up with the name Aquaria?  Is it plural for aquarium  - as your proteins look like they are placed in transparent tanks? Would be nice to be able to "feed" these creatures with ligands and dietary minerals, to see some action.    What do you think about breathable chocolate without calories - like inhaler from Le Whif.

 Thanks, I will make a screenshot with less colorful wallpaper.   To make you guys sleep good I have just removed WRITE permission, at least for now. Hope you will appreciate it.   I honestly have to say I didn't check it with Exchange calendar, as I have never though that it would be so popular. But if it will continue - I will make such test, to make sure that I don't ignore any bug - and I can sleep well.   As before that one I was into Bitcoin apps, page is already there (http://tajchert.pl/donation/) but I don't plan (at least now) a paid version as red tape work in Poland is awful and you need a company to pay tax from sells, but will take a look at that in few days and future apps. Thank you for proposing.   Thank you, I have never imagine (in my life) as student, with none class about programming for Android, I would end up at Android Police main page...  Thank you to all of you that up voted/rated/criticized it! I will make everything to make all your request come true!   Thanks, I will make (even) more tests and dive into that to find that bug. Please let me now PM or here if it disappeared or not.   In upcoming days I will add a feature to add own colors, and a checkbox "use calendar color" so please stay tuned.  About that colored area whre you don't have anything - double check if for sure you don't have - maybe a hidden event?   Sorry I can't get list of alarms from the system... I will do a second look at and experiment with some undocumented database but probably it will end up working only on some phones. In such situation it isn't on priority list todo.   I will take a look into that, and probably write email of calendar owner with some small font below calendar name. Thanks for pointing that out.   In a meant time I pushed a update solving that bug. But thank you for your effort to test it.   Thanks! I though they are gone for good, but now I have nothing no to defend myself for making that mistake. I just uploaded update to Google Play and it should be available in few hours. Hope you will enjoy it, there is small glitch that if  you make it full screen marked area is a bit out of clock - will fix as soon as I can.    Thanks, my friend (when developing it) suggested it to me but I said "maybe later" now I see that it a good idea, and I would add it (but as opt-in in settings).   It show events from next 12 hours, it updates each 30 minutes and checks if there is any new event to show. If it doesn't fully answer your question, just ask one more time with longer description of a issue.    Sorry to disappoint you, but no. It is one year old idea, but there was always something more important to do, and I wasn't convinced that it would be so successful.  But it is nice to see that not only I have cool ideas, even if very similar.   I don't need any email permission, here are these that I use:  uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_CALENDAR"/  uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_CALENDAR"/  permission to write, modify event I need as in near future I will add some cool function and, if I would add then that ask for permission most users would not update (as automatically update would work in such case).   It is done that way. Maybe it is not very visible - I will add option to set it by user.   Thanks, mate! Is that a maximum bottom (as you can) position? Or you can't scroll at all?   It shows only events from next 12 hours - however, in some post here was it mentioned (to add events from 24hours), and I will experiment with that (maybe second circle with events?).   Thanks, added to my ToDo list.   Sorry to hear, I tested it with only 7-8 calendars. Can you provide some screenshots, and elaborate on it? Here or PM me. I would be more than happy to solve it.   Exactly, that my next idea in my mind - probably I will take a deeper look into it in few days, as I wan't to polish that one to perfection.   Would you like a color (as that in events) which indicates temperature, during next 12hours? However I don't know how to show rain/sun on it.    I already started designing slim one - digital one. But it is more work to make it as simple and perfectly readable at the same time.   Sorry, as in 4.4 there is no lock screen widget I have forgotten about that - just rapaired it, will be in few hours available in Google Play.   Thank you sir, you can adjust transparency of pie when adding a widget - from close to 0 to almost nontransparent one.   Next update (working on it) will bring customization, so stay tuned.   Sorry, there is nothing that I can do with that, as I need those to read/add events to your calendar - but since app doesn't have a permission to access Internet, you are safe (even if I would be evil). I'm currently working on some extra features (personalization etc.) when done, and I would clean project most likely I would publish code.         I have added a post while it was happening... http://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/comments/1tadyy/2_pizzas_for_10k_dogecoins/   [How it look like from Europe.](http://i.imgur.com/LeZfYcZ.gif)   Looks like a perfect bag for waterboarding.

Mogu li jednom nesto da naprave kako treba??   Have FUN!   Jebiga, znas ti da su ljudi kriticni (i moraju da budu, kada iza svakog coska cekaju preveranti) ne samo kod nas   Gde to pise u tekstu sajta?  Znamo svi da sama rec slabo vredi u danasnja doba.  PS: Sto mi se svidja je da se tacno vidi ko je kad koliko donirao. Mrzim kada stvari nisu transparentni.    Pa doniraj   To bi i ja rekao. Sta ce biti sa parama ako decko umre, ne daj boze?    pa sta ti mislis otkud meni trideset evra!   [Nisu Srbi repa bez korena](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THUJ2JRWIuU)      ima paypal?  EDIT: [EVO ti ga!](http://behumaneworldcup.com/sr/)  PS: Necu valjda dopustiti da neki rectal_smasher vise od mene donira  EDIT2: Nema kosovske zastave.

Mislim da je to, kako si napisao, isto razlog da kod nas vlada haos... U nekom smislu. Ne zna se ko placa niti ko pije    If you want you can also stay in Serbia forever. Marry someone make a lot of kids. We need people who want to live on countryside...    You will be treated like a King if you say that you are from Russia.  Come to Novi Sad also https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejBgQd5iLjY   Opera  bio sam, ali meni je bilo dosadno... ali svako je drugaciji   i u nemackoj se porez odbija odmah, ali prica se o bruto platu.   Jer ako recimo covekA zaradi 2000 neto i covekB isto 2000 ne mora da znaci da obe zarade istu bruto platu.   Kako mozes reci, na primer kada hoces da se zaposlis kod nekoga, da hoces 2000 neto?! To nema smisla, jer onaj koji te zaposli pojma nema koliko bi to bruto znacilo za njega.   To je absolutno besmisleno    Posto sam naisao na ovaog kalkulatora poreza za Hrvatsku gde se ukuca neto plata.  http://danporezneslobode.manjiporezi.hr/  http://www.index.hr/vijesti/clanak/izracunajte-koliko-dana-u-godini-radite-za-drzavu/818168.aspx  Kako kod nas racuna Neto/Bruto plata?   Nikad nisam razumeo zasto se prica samo o neto plati u Srbiji, nije mi jasno?!?! U nemackoj kad se prica o plati onda uvek iskljucljivo o bruto plate.   Jer imamo razlicite poreze (1 do 6), zavisi uvek da li si single, ozenjen itd.   Od Bruto plate ti se oduzima porez za platu, crkvu itd. zdravsto, sozijalno... na kraju znas koliko ti ostaje neto.     Laser tek... Kod usca   o cemu pricas? Nisam ni citao o cemu se radi...   kako bosna moze biti inspiracija...?   thx   ne brini, ima Srba, ima jos   glasaj za, i ne deli narod. nece biti rata ako glasas za ujedinjenje... boze   lol   armija za ponos... lol   you sure?   what game is this and on which console? i just know mario on N64   No   Yeah sure.

Ne bih rekao da oni to koriste vezano za nacistima.   Taj krst nose i goth, metal- i esoterski ljudi btw (Pise u nemackom wikipediju, i zabranjeno samo ako je povezano za nekom neonacistickom strankom).  I oblik je drugaciji.   Ovi su vise crkveni ljudi a ne bi ih povezao nikako s tim ljudima koji si sada u tom linku podstavio (sto jeste nacisticko)   Nisam siguran na sta mislis.   Ali nije naci krst u svakom slucaju?  Ovako nesto? http://de.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keltenkreuz   Old serbian Song. As you know Kosovo i serbia. http://youtu.be/rt23QtNn17g  so if you choose an albanian song its not really a song from Kosovo   koji naci krst?    Sviranje, pevanje, malo sport, druzenje, kolo, priroda... sjajno.   To deca sigurno nece zaboraviti.    Bolje nego da gledaju neke starlete/prostitutke na TVu ili da vise na redditu...

Latin is also fine. And when your serbian is better with the time its easy to switch to cyrillic. If you can't find anything so you can also try to find "croatian"(its actually the serbian language in a other dialect "ijekavica" instead of "ekavica", which many serbs are also speaking)    Isto je to   yes that was what I was thinking about   kmeeeeee   [.](http://www.troll.me/images/ancient-aliens-guy/idiots.jpg)   Glasajte za dveri, i taj bullshit ce biti cenzurisan.

 Not that what he said was right or factually accurate but I don't understand how people think he thinks all Mexicans are bad people. Or even most. He just thinks there is a huge border problem and a lot of the illegals are dangerous. He might be wrong. But that doesn't mean he is racist. I think a lot of people are being unfair and not even trying to understand him. I am willing to say he is your typical narrow minded republican.  	1
 Not to mention how dangerous that can be, literally a hotbox for diseases    Yeah, we're going to need to talk about your TPS reports   What did you do the first time? Maybe we can help..   I hear you on the coffee broseph  	4
 I'm going to admit the bold "fuck off" in this post startled me at first.  I *know* I have more to live for then this, but if I'm functioning just fine right now...  	1
 I agree that it's not a big deal (I see it as I would any other drug such as marijuana). But it's not a good idea for law enforcement to break the law and enforce the same law.   I... don't think that's likely.   This seems... random. 300 people for the man who almost became President?      I'm curious then why my experience was dismissed as anectodal while the one I responded to wasn't.  Criticism is fine, but only if it is fair. When it isn't fair, it is "bashing".   Good point.   I think growth is more terrifying.   The "new" path? That is how the free market operates without proper oversight.   Well, I notice you didn't make the same comment to the anecdote I was replying to. As a proud LGBT Southern activist (on one local board and one statewide board), South-bashing is tired and not very productive. Minimizing my experience but not that of the commenter to whom I replied is a good example of how subtle it can be.  As for relevance, I responded to an anecdote with a counter-anecdote.   I live in GA (notably _not_ Atlanta) and have never felt threatened because I'm gay.   I will do a happy fuck you dance when I return my Comcast equipment.   Wait what does this mean at the end?   If (name redacted) would like us to post the rest of the conversation, he cannot bring $15to the Metro Spirit office today by 3:00.   The planet is not your private domain.   I think "consumers" is the best response so far (and what your suggestion - potential Tesla owners - seems to imply). But I don't think Democrats champion "consumers" as prominently as Republicans champion "the free market".      Demographics happened to Regency...   Wait - what does gun ownership have to do with Tesla not being able to sell directly?   That was a statement made by _his_ attorney, not any prosecutor. I agree with your general point though.   Even assuming that's true, is that relevant here? Who's the little man that the Democrats aren't supporting?   To be fair though, Republicans carry the free-market-above-all-else banner proudly and loudly, and more so than Democrats.      It's the other way around, my friend.   The Right to Personal Dignity/Privacy      Cynicism is not wisdom.   Of course I'm referring to race. You must live in that conservative fantasy colorblind world, despite all evidence to the contrary.  Do you not recognize the racial problem in our justice/political system? Because acceptance of that fact is Step 1 in this discussion.  As for your last point... did you hear about the rioting and looting at the Pumpkin Festival up north, and all the hooligans who were arrested, and shot and killed?   One of the major problems with the whole Ferguson situation is that the elected officials don't reflect the community.  So, yes, vote. Use the ballot box and elect your leaders.  This strikes me as FOXNews playing the race card race card. If you don't think there is an issue with race in this country (particularly between law enforcement and African-Americans) you just aren't fucking paying attention.   It just seems like a non-issue to me. I don't see it as being a good or a bad/cringy thing.   Actual gay uncle with no kids checking in. It may well be more of an individual proclivity and not a in-born thing but I do have a very strong desire to support by brother's and sister's children in any way possible.  Whether I have kids myself is still an open question. But until I do, I try to divert my resources their way as much as possible.  I suggest it may be an individual thing because I love both my siblings. Were there bad blood, the desire to help their children may not be there.   Never been to Atlanta, I see. Homo-mecca.   If by "pretty large" you mean "one of the largest in the U.S.", yes.   Broadly, yes. But the Constitution was a refinement of the Articles of Confederation. And the Commerce Clause was specifically intended to help improve upon the Articles by giving the federal government more authority.  The Commerce Clause was designed to make the federal government more powerful. You and others not understanding that doesn't make it any less so.   If I come in during posted business hours and get turned away or am given a shitty attitude, I just don't ever return.  Simple as that.   Why is it noteworthy she liked her own status?   Um, no. Way to let hyperbole completely take attention away from any validity your point may have.  The Commerce Clause + the Necessary and Proper Clause do vest the federal government with broad authority, but not absolute authority.  The intent was to give the national government a level of authority over the national economy. Naturally, if the national economy grows, so will that authority.   I've met those who _claim_ to care more about corporate welfare (such as yourself). But actions speak much louder on this point.  And why can't a liberal complain about vitriol? Not a single person encompasses the boogey-liberal-man you're apparently terrified of. Also, I didn't excuse Holder of anything.  You seriously have issues, my friend.   The national economy is _much_ more interconnected than it was at the Founding. I personally think the clause is currently interpreted correctly.   I think it's the other way around. The ANGC probably wouldn't notice if the hotel isn't open by April, but the Partridge Inn definitely would.   How _you_ doin'?   Voter turnout.   What in the world are you talking about?   Serious class hatred going on with you...   Yup. If I ever meet a libertarian who is more concerned about corporate welfare than human welfare, I might actually listen to what they're saying.  Until then, it's disingenuous and a cover for selfish greed.   Noble attempt but there's some intense astroturfing taking place in these comments.   That this vitriolic personal attack has positive upvotes tells me everything I need to know about this thread.  Good grief, people.   The renderings for the rooms show a dramatic improvement from their current state.  This is a great development!         Try asking the folks at the clubhou.se.   Try Auben Realty.   ~$18!  I use it for movies and in-app purchases.   Never made sense given contacts.google.com.   For the love of God don't give the reigns to the GOP. They seem to be too often blinded by budgetary hubris.   Jokers usually work outside the normal rules so it works well, I think.   It's ridiculous to claim employers and employees have equal leverage when negotiating, particularly with high unemployment.  A UBI would even that out that a good bit though.   I don't see this as necessarily hypocritical. If any one business in a market voluntarily raises it, that business is at a competitive disadvantage. The minimum wage levels the playing field.  A big element of the value of having a minimum wage is that it is required of _all_ businesses (particularly competitors).   Wet wipes. Dry is for cavemen.   Well, considering you have no idea who I am or what I do, the same insult seems to apply to you.    Ultracrepidarian  Is this an insult or what?   I think it's a diplomatic tactic to take advantage of inevitable sensationalism.   We're not talking ethics, we're talking accounting. Math is math - there's no "agreeing to disagree".  You might view it differently politically, but a tax deduction still costs the government money (just as if they were to eliminate the student loan interest deduction and send you an equivalent check every year).   Yes, I have. Quit being a condescending prick.  To bring up an example you used elsewhere in this thread...  There is zero practical difference between the government telling me to keep $20 more of my income and the government taxing me as usual but sending me $20. It reduces the amount of money in the government coffers exactly the same (and increase my money exactly the same).  Whatever amount of money you got to keep because you took the student loan interest deduction can just as easily be viewed as a check from the government.   A deduction based on student loans is giving me something I wouldn't have had otherwise, not allowing me to keep something I already have. It's essentially the government taking taxes from other people and using it to offset my liability.  Edit: And how many people does it take to remind you to vote?   Yes, they are "welfare". What else would it be? Magic free money?   Wait don't we subsidize the crap out of oil and coal?   Mot's is dog food.  Blasphemy   It's a very small segment of the community that votes. You have to buy a magazine (or have a subscription) because the ballot is inside an issue. Basically the Hill and no one else.  Easily manipulated, particularly in quiet categories.   "It says maybe more!" [walks in] "oh. not more."   The value is having the Google Voice number, not the block feature.  Post the Google Voice number to the public and set it up to ring your cell number.    I'd be surprised if Ebola ever makes it to America, honestly.  ?   The panel opinion suggests that obtaining a photo ID to vote cant be a big deal, because one needs a photo ID to fly. Thats a common misconception. See Transportation Security Administration, _Acceptable IDs_, www.tsa.gov/traveler-information/acceptable-ids. Since, despite the 9/11 attacks that killed thousands, a photo ID is not considered essential to airline safety, it seems beyond odd that it should be considered essential to electoral validity.   _Read_ the goddamn opinion. Judge Posner addresses all these arguments. (Spoiler: Photo ID is _not_ always necessary to purchase a gun.)   I counted up to the level all four had in common (11), multiplied by 4, and then added the 3 loners.    The thing is... when you start thinking this, you've already started believing it. Because everyone younger than me is stupid.   So the top comment in a thread asking what websites don't show up on Google... is a website that is literally Google?         If this is the same thing that was recently reported, they would hold the person down and stick fingers in his butthole and then into his own mouth.   How many white people don't have a birth certificate? Many elderly black people don't because it wasn't common during segregation.   The reward is nonexistent so the risk is still higher. Unless it's a coordinated effort, it just doesn't make sense to do.  And I've never seen any evidence of individuals doing it in any meaningful numbers, and not even one bit of evidence that it happens in a coordinated fashion.   And chemically castrated by the UK government for being homosexual, despite being instrumental in defeating the Nazis.  He was recently pardoned posthumously. His homosexuality and persecution should always be remembered.   This tactic is such crap. _You_ are implying minorities are not _smart_ enough or whatever to get ID. No one else is. The issue is how difficult it is (e.g., driving long distances, taking off work).   What's the incentive? Eligible voters already bitch that their vote is meaningless. Why would someone risk serious jail time for one additional meaningless vote?  It doesn't make sense. It's all about preventing Democratic-leaning voters from voting.   It is... but that's why most individual rights are protected by the federal government. Those 3 appellate judges don't give a shit what happens in Columbia.  Great info, too!   Minor bump in the road. The highest court that will hear the federal case (the 4th Circuit Court of Appeals) struck down Virginia's ban.  SC officials are simply wasting time and money. It's very disingenuous for anyone with knowledge of the legal system to throw up their hands and say, "But who knows how this case will be decided".  We know exactly how it'll be decided, because the highest court that will hear the case already did.   Hmm. We should get a lemur.   Based on your logic, he could have married his sister prior to today. What exactly is the point of this statement?   Unexpected but good. Voter ID laws at best are a solution looking for a problem. At worst, well, politics.   Two muscle bears fucking is pretty manly.   To you. Simply because you don't understand the problem doesn't mean the problem doesn't exist.   Charleston and Columbia are now issuing same-sex marriage licenses!  Any N. Augusta or Aiken couples planning on heading to Columbia?      Anyone who listens to music without headphones is King Douchebag of Everygym.   I would love to see this group grow and really help develop Augusta's tech industry, particularly with the introduction of the Cyber Command.      The statement from the representative does not indicate they sent it via regular mail as well.   As this decision* will lead to the invalidation of South Carolina's same-sex marriage ban, I think posting this in /r/Augusta is appropriate.  *Changed "ruling" to "decision", after 4 net upvotes.            Yes.   Probably. Best practice is to send an important document via certified mail and regular mail.   I'm a lawyer and own my practice. I will hire more employees when my caseload increases (i.e., when there is more demand).  Cut my taxes and I'll just have more money.   Carolina Ale House? Although if you don't like Buffalo Wild Wing, I don't imagine you'd like it.  Somewhere in Augusta is local.      The drawing style is incredible.   I just point out that there are two religion clauses in the 1st Amendment: the Free Exercise Clause (the "of") and the Establishment Clause (the "from").   At some point in the past I read in what I remember to have considered a reputable source that the "greying" of Presidents has a lot to do with the age window men are most likely to be in when they assume that office.   The weirdest part is I don't think many people thought this would happen again so quickly. I'm 32. I very clearly remember 2003.  I guess I thought the memory loss was a generational thing. Nope. Much quicker.   Yeah my first time was not, um, porn-worthy.   Even in death, he leaves his mark.   That seems to me how it boils down.   I think it may be dodgy wording. Currently, the property is tax exempt and I think the question is whether that should continue if operated by private companies.  Never trust how a ballot measure is worded.   Oops - thanks for that. Autocorrect strikes again. It should be "continue".   hell, just look at the comments section on any political article on Augusta Chronicle!  Ain't that the truth (this article included).   The ballot language is as follows:  Shall property owned by the University System of Georgia and utilized by providers of college and university student housing and other facilities continue to be exempt from taxation to keep costs affordable?  I am extremely skeptical of the privatization trend and was shocked to learn that this seemingly innocuous proposal was part of a larger dorm-privatization plan.  I'm voting "No".      Very difficult because it is hard to rebut someone saying they forgot or were mistaken.    Well, no pressure or anything, right?   I completely understand that. But the issue is whether China's cooperation with South Africa is so essential that the decision to cancel the event can justifiably be characterized as a decision in name only ("You can't really blame the SA government.")   Right, that's it's a pressure. But it's not a live or die pressure, which would certainly take precedence. (I read your post as implying that it was live or die.)  	121

 I known exactly what you mean, I recently gained 40 pounds and cried while getting dressed for Christmas today. I missed thanksgiving because I was so embarrassed  my weight gain. Today I felt defeated and sorry for myself but eventually I found something I felt mildly comfortable wearing and promised myself I would do whatever it took to make sure I didn't feel this way next christmas.  Just make the choice to make 2015 different. You've lost the weight before, you can do it again, you just have to Crack down and commit to it.    Thank you so much for the advice. I used to track my food, like 2 years ago, and it worked wonders. I don't know why I never tried it again, but you're absolutely right. I'm just guessing at my diet, assuming I'm making the right choices, but I'm probably not. I'm going to download MFP tonight and start fresh in the morning. Thank you again!    Wow that makes so much sense I wonder how the thought never occurred to me before! Thank you VERY much for that insight, I'll look into that avenue more.   Actually I've been considering switching switching for some time now. I was diagnosed with severe depression and anxiety  (used to be VERY prone to anxiety attacks) at 16 (11 years ago) and first tried Paxil. That made me so much worse. My self harming increased and I became more suicidal. My doc at the time took me off of that and put me on Lexapro. It worked well enough, and I've been too scared to try anything else because of my experience with Paxil. But I'm thinking more and more it's time to try something new. There are so many signs that say this just isn't the right thing for me.   Im a 27 year old female, 5'2". March of this year I was 185lbs. I joined a boxing club and was instantly obsessed. I was doing great going 3-5 days a week and I actually gained a couple of pounds because of muscle but I dropped a dress size and I was in GREAT shape, but more importantly I felt great about myself.  I started this gym to try to help my depression in an un-medicated fashion but it didn't help, so in June I got back on Lexapro. Since then I've gone from 187 to 215. I've been at 215 for about 2 months now. I know the medicine is the main cause for the weight gain but I'll admit I'm having trouble getting into the gym for months now. Injuries, illness, I  didn't have a car for a full month, and my job kept me away so I got into the habit of just not going. Right now I go about once a week. I want so badly to go more but this is my busiest time of year at work and I just can't get the time in.   I don't know if I'm writing this for support, advice, or to just get it off of my chest. I'm just so damn frustrated it's moving me to tears. I don't recognize myself in the mirror anymore. NONE of my clothes fit. None. I'm at the highest weight I've ever been in my life and I have so much work to do to get back to where I started this year it feels impossible.   I was at an indoor range shooting my Sig p226 and a spent shell bounced off the side of my lane and straight down my shirt. That's the day I learned ladies  shouldn't wear V-neck shirts while shooting.   Fuck. That. Have you ever had a hot, freshly  spent shell fly down your shirt and land on your breasts? I have. Still have the scar after 5 years.   This might be a little long, but here goes...  My husband and I lived next door to an elderly couple, the wife was sick and dying and the husband was an alcoholic/drug addict/drug dealer. He would use and deal his dying wife's meds in his driveway or right in the street. We should have known there was going to be problems because he told us he's glad "a nice white couple moved in" because he's tired of "living next to worthless niggers." One night soon after we moved in, he was banging on our door at 3 am saying someone was trying to break into his house. My husband went over there with a gun and made sure the place was clear but the old man kept him there till 5 am. This happened 2 more times before my husband just said "it's not my problem, call the cops".  Here's the worst night; my husband called at 1 am to say he was almost home from the rig. Shortly after, I heard banging on the door. Thinking it was my husband and he forgot his keys I opened the door without checking. It was the old man, high as hell and  holding a machettee, saying he saw someone in my yard trying to break into the other side of my house. I grab the Sig Sauer, call 911, and go search the yard, finding nothing. Cops get there, arrest him because it's the 5th similar incident of the day. He's sent to a mental hospital and his poor sick wife is left alone and evicted.   Inception and The Dark Knight.  Fantastic soundtracks.    I relate so much to the second dog so much it hurts   My best friend in high school was horrified of butterflies. I always thought she was full of shit, till one day in the park one flew near her and she dropped to the ground screaming and crying. Took forever to calm her down.   My college roommate (also my best friend since 3rd grade) brought home a girl he met in math class. She and I became fast friends (im a girl). They fell in love and we became the 3 muksateers. He committed suicide a few months later. She and I survived because we had each other. Still best friends 7 years later.   The most beautiful game I've ever played and you captured it well! Great work!   Me too! It was amazing. He's amazing!.   *insert Harvey Birdman laugh here* If I had gold to give, it would be yours. I love puns.   My husband and I were at a friend's destination wedding in the mountains a few years ago, and we got into an argument after the rehearsal dinner. Seeing as I was the maid of honor with a wedding to control the next day,  and it was like 1 am, I left him outside to smoke a cigar and went to bed. Next thing I know at 3 am and he's in my ear telling me to look up. I roll over, the room is pitch black save for the dozens of fireflies. He knew I'd never seen them before,  so he spent 2 hours in the dark catching them by hand, then released them in our room at the cabin.   Next to our wedding, that was the best night of my life.  	16

 The Walking Dead - Still (Season 4, Episode 12).   Absolutely nothing happened - basically an hour of bullshit character development. Most of the episode revolves around Beth wanting alcohol. She's willing to risk her life, and Daryl's too, for her first fucking taste of alcohol. God damn it, Beth, you're in the zombie apocalypse, not a sorority.    Stay classy, Newport.    Shutter Island      Ass to ass!   I've had my car for 5 years and I'm only about to hit 40,000 miles. At this rate, I can't be immature for another 5 more years. Am I doing driving wrong? :(   Have you talked to your professor at all?  My husband was in the same position as you last semester. He was all set to graduate, but he could not for the life of him pass any of his tests in his language course. He had to get a decent grade on his final just to pass - he was averaging 50s on the tests and he needed close to a 75 or something on the final. In the final weeks, he asked his professor for help as much as possible, tried to show he cared about the class and was really trying but just couldn't grasp the content. He also told her that he needed to pass this course to graduate and that he had a job lined up after graduation, which obviously he would lose if he didn't graduate. He studied hard for the final, but he was confident that he failed. However, two days before graduation his professor emailed him and said he had just barely passed the class and he was graduating. I have no clue what he actually scored on his final, but he likes to think that talking to his professor is what helped. She actually was willing to work with him - she offered extra credit and was willing to drop his lowest test grade to see if it would help.   So, if you haven't talked to your professor, I would highly recommend it. Seek all the help you can get. Best of luck.    I am in the same boat. I sometimes feel extremely nauseous in the mornings. I also have terrible stomach pains. The main thing that helps is having a bowel movement and my doctor prescribed Zofran for the nausea. If I don't have a BM or don't take the medicine, the pain and nausea just go away after being awake for a couple hours.   I would definitely try exercise to see if it helps. I tend to feel better when I'm standing up and moving around.    We did this as well. For sex we came up with "taking the beef bus to tuna town."   This. Exactly this.  I don't understand why you want/need your parents' permission to return home. You're an adult now, you are free to make your own choices. If you feel so strongly about returning to your hometown, support yourself. Get your own place. If you can't afford to do this own your own, find roommates to help split the cost of rent.    Pope Leo X allegedly found entertainment in young naked boys leaping from cakes.   Taken at Devou Park?   Hm... The dinosaur [must have switched his allegiance.](http://i.imgur.com/i9Q7jeh.jpg)   I'm from Northern Kentucky and can confirm there are tons of people with that last name.   Edit: Wording.    Her vagine hang like sleeve of wizard.    In the show, there was no mention of Tysha (Tyrion's first wife) during the climactic events which led to Tyrion killing Shae and Tywin. In the book, Jaime reveals the truth about Tysha which absolutely enrages Tyrion and fuels him to find Tywin, ultimately resulting in the two deaths. I am so disappointed the show didn't follow the book.   I was having a wonderful day. This just ruined everything. I am so devastated. My husband and I adore him. What Dreams May Come is one of our favorite movies - this solidifies that I'll sob through that movie every single time I watch it in the future. Time to watch all his movies and cry!   My grandmother would spend hours preparing Thanksgiving dinner every year. One year, my grandpa kept joking that HE stayed up all night slaving over the stove, which obviously made Grandma very angry. My grandma was a serious and religious women who very rarely cussed, but she turned to my grandpa that Thanksgiving and said, "Ronald, that must be your ass talking because your mouth knows better." It was so unexpected. My grandpa was absolutely dumbfounded.   	18
 yes ive seen this a bunch on reddit today  	1
    Correct. It was less than a week before Sirius went to Azkaban after the death of the Potters.    GoF is still on HBO, but it's probably the worst film, so who cares?   Ayup.    Yea. I went through the same thing. My parents adopted my mom's brother's daughter.  (I'll throw in former roommate for the joke)   Now that you mention it, he took a shower after every quidditch match.    Yea, he only took one bath. Kinda gross.   If you buy the super expensive copies they have the deleted scenes on an extras disk, but ABC Fam just edits them all together.. most at least.   That's a good point. He would get new ones at the Dursleys. Not sure about the UK, but an adopted child gets assistance in the states.   Why is there no mention of Harry getting larger glasses as he ages? Certainly the glasses he had as a child would not fit him in his later years.   ABCFam also includes all  the deleted scenes.   You are right. But it just seemed tedious on my first read, I wanted to get into the action! But in my re-reads, it actually does fit in quite nicely.   You could start over, or join Pottermore.   Starts at 3:30 EDT today.   Gof or HBP.  Goblet was such a *whodunnit*, and Voldemort comes back, and Albus and Cornelius are on different planets at the end.  For HBP, it grabs you in the second chapter. I remember my wife and I reading it the release night thinking, "What the hell is Snape on about?" (we had always thought he was a good guy) Anyway we learned all about Riddle's past and the horcruxes, and then the ultimate act of bravery(?) happened, and there was nothing but speculation for the next 18 months.   I like you. I would tongue-punch your fart box all night.   However, you seem a bit centered on the color of a person's skin. We all bleed the same color.  And... We've all got both light and dark inside us. What matters is the part we choose to act on. That's who we really are.      No they didn't.    He probably would have tried to kill Malfoy or at the very least completely discredit him.    It would have been interesting if She allowed Sirius to live until HBP, and he died because of one of Draco's failed attempts at Dumbledore.   Harry not using the damn mirror before rushing off to the ministry and an ambush.   You're on top of that story, aren't you.   I would think Sirius would teach the same things Harry taught the DA. Wasn't it Sirius and Lupin that gave Harry those defense books for Christmas in OotP?   It's common for only the first child in the states.   Four months is still a bit early for a baby shower though. They're usually done in the last trimester of pregnancy, but then I have no clue about English culture,   True.   Could be referring to Lily Luna.   A: One less drunk.   Once again, your essay does not disappoint. Bravo.   Perhaps she pricked him after his darkmark was fresh.       My way home is my favorite also. Like /u/Best_Roommate says, My Lunch is a real tear jerker.   I don't understand why so many like My Musical. I usually skip that one on the Netflix.  My Philosophy is a **GREAT** episode.  Edit: More would be: My Own American Girl, My Screw Up, and My Cake like everyone else.    Probably Megadeth.    I like it, but it looks like a cover-up with all the black.   I put mine between the cellophane and the pack.   Even worse is people who litter in state parks. (I'm American) These places are reserved for wildlife to grow abound, and people throw trash on the trails. When I hike, I pick up everything I see and put it in my pocket, even the butts.   Their grammar. You are the product of four billion years of evolution, act like it.    Firstly, the toilets aren't the only way in  They used the floo network also, but I will say that flushing yourself in was only implicated after Voldemort took over the ministry.   I'm 38, and I re-read at least once a year. I'm envious of you on your first read.   Side note, I would stay far away from this sub until you are finished.      Darkmark goes on the left arm unless that's a mirror image.   The fifth house is Tigera. The founder was Taranus Tigera, the colors were orange and black, and she preferred her common room just outside the herbology department on the outskirts of the Forbidden Forest where she could be close to nature.   Yea, I think he sold them. Sorry.   I would imagine they could use the floo network within the castle. We saw it once when Snape wanted Lupin to look at the marauders map.   EDT*   It's mentioned plenty of times. Honestly, will you ever read *Hogwarts, a history?*   Well, Ginny did name Pigwidgeon.       She's not a doormat and she's not an angel.  No she wasn't. Lily was a fiery, strong headed ginger. That's where Harry got most of his bullheadedness from. Everyone thought Harry was so much like James, but I would propose that he was *most* like Lily wearing a James mask... except for the eyes of course.   YAY!    Good enough for me, good night.   Professor Black did not hear everything they said. He only heard 'forest of Dean' whe Hermione opened her bag for the tent. When her beaded bag was closed, all he heard was the jumble of things.   I like that assessment, but I think the locket would have killed Harry. I don't think Snape would have been watching.   Snape didn't know they had the locket, he was just trying to give them the sword.  Side note: How did Severus get it under a sheet of ice?   Half Blood Prince was my favorite, followed closely by Goblet of Fire.  We learned so much that tied the first five together in HBP, and GOF was the first one I read cover to cover in one sitting. My wife had read it first, and after I got to. Exciting after a werewolf runs the grounds.    I will. One of my friends in High School and I hung out simply because we had *Hem Hem,* connections. He was my age, and our mutual desire was two years younger.  From our junior year to our senior year, we fought over who was going to take her out. She broke up with him so I assumed she was free game our junior year. I took her out on dates for about three weeks, then we split amicably.   Long story short, come our senior year we became good friends tying to cock block all of her new male interests.   Not really *good friends,* but we hung out a lot more the last year.  Edit: We always had a discussion if the guy she was with was good enough for her.   That scene or the puff scene...   I've always liked this one. Reminds me of a time about 25 years ago in high school, when a frenemie of mine liked the same girl.

The father replies: "Well son, I could give you the book definitions, but I feel it could be best to show you by example. Go upstairs and ask your mother if she'd have sex with the mailman for $500,000." The boy goes and asks his mother: "Mom, would you have sex with the mailman for $500,000?" The mother replies: "Hell yes I would!" The little boy returns to his father: "Dad, she said 'Hell yes I would!'" The father then says: "Okay, now go and ask your older sister if she'd have sex with her principal for $500,000." The boy asks his sister: "Would you have sex with your principal for $500,000?" The sister replies: "Hell yes I would!" He returns to his father: "Dad, she said 'Hell yes I would!'" The father answers: "Okay son, here's the deal: Hypothetically, we're millionaires, but in reality, we're just living with a couple of whores."   Probably a 7-2 offsuit, and she was repping a full house.  In all seriousness, I don't like kool aid. I do drink a lot of gatorade.    Tell me a bird story. Ever had one get loose in the store?

She said so in an interview like Cronos said, but it wasn't at Hogwarts, it was in Hagrid's hut.   Albus used HR to know that Ron and Harry were in Hagrid's hut under the cloak in CoS.   TIL..    What does a thestral have to do with death? I understand that only those that have seen death can see thestrals, but it still makes no sense.    So?   Sure there is. One of the Slytherins biggest traits is self preservation. While the Gryffs would run into a fight (bravery), if a Slytherin knew that the outcome wouldn't benefit them, they would run away.   I'll have a Bertie Bott's, three chocolate frogs, three pumpkin pasties, and two licorice wands please.   I got it.   How do I change it?   Why change my flair?     (as believed by Dumbledore)  Isn't that enough?     Ravenclaw  Whichever position  I would like to be on the team  I have played mod quidditch   Harry! Harry! Did you choke on your toothbrush?   All well and good, except Ignotus Peverell created the cloak, not death incarnate.      OOHHH! My bad. I had to wait for each book.    I had never thought about that aspect of it. Kudos!  Not to rain on your parade, but the quote is, "..why on Earth should that mean it is not real?"   I am old enough to have read each book prior to its corresponding movie  There was only one book.   That gave me a seizure thank you very much.   I would add that Universal was totally going under, and that addition saved and revitalized the park.    I have no idea about Discworld. Just what I have read about the Potterverse.   She more than likely summoned them from the kitchen.    In the book, the glass never re-appeared, Dudley just fell in the water.   It's explained as *obliviate* in the film, but in the book she didn't wipe their memories per se, she modified them to make them think they were Wendell and Monica Wilkins, who's life's dream was to move to Australia.  Just another time the films took liberties to try to move the plot for the audience.   I think he was referring to the clothes they had on before they took the polyjuice. They all didn't have an identical wardrobe like in the film, just clothes that would fit.   Me too. In Bruges is another great one he's in with Ralph Fiennes.   On the rare occasion that a male werewolf meets a female werewolf while they are both transformed, and they mate, the offspring will in fact just be highly intelligent wolves.   There *are* some of those in the forest, so perhaps that's what Riddle was referring to?   Ahhh, my bad.   Don't forget Crouch Jr. was under the imperius curse a long time himself.    They're on Youtube.    Listen to me, Potter. Your pal Diggory? By your age he could turn a whistle into a watch and have it sing you the time. Miss Delacour is as much a fairy princess as I am. As for Krum, his head may be filled with sawdust, but Karkaroff's is not. They'll have a strategy. And you can bet that it will play to Krum's strengths. Come on, Potter, what are you strengths?   In short, they were all exceptionally powerful.   Book would be GoF and film would be HBP.      I live under a bridge thank you very much.   Bob had bitch tits.   You know they float...   The duel between Voldemort and Dumbledore in the ministry.    Not sure, he never talked about it much, but his nails were always wonky.    Not really, it was still a boggart.  I re-created the feelings a dementor gave Harry, but it could never have kissed him.   Viet Cong shoved bamboo shoots under my dad's nails.    Very nice.   One question, are you implying Severus and Lily went together or do you mean that one of them did it of their own volition?   That's cool, how does she like it so far?    Yea, we have all read them, and they are well worn. Some are held together with duct tape, and there are dog ears and underlines and notes.    She will more than likely be a Gryffindor. I see the traits in her already.   But of course. If there was ever a truer Slytherin in the series, it would be Lucius Malfoy.   But of course it's my fellow potterheads on Reddit. I have learned more from you lot, than I ever did in my 20+ rereads.   Someone preparing a Brazilian wax.   I ordered a pizza the other day, and when the girl was reading me back my order she says, "So you have one large, thick, sausage, anything else?" I looked her dead in the eye and said, "Yes, I also ordered a pizza."  	118
 http://www.thematinggrounds.com/   Seriously.   I loved Tyrone!  In "Elway's Greatest Comebacks", a Steve Sabol film that we had on VHS when I was little, Braxton is featured heavily commenting on the *other* game-winning drive that started on the 2 yard line:  [The Drive II] (http://youtu.be/03pqRihRbMA?t=18m20s)   http://youtu.be/NRItYDKSqpQ   Fuck you Seahawk!  In all seriousness, it was my very favorite too.  Boomer and TJ, with that iconic music that they would get into:  Duh-duhduh-duuuuuhduhduh-duh-duhduh.  Duh-duh-duhduhduhduhduh-duhduhduhduhduhduh (duh duh duh!)  and so on . . .  We had season tickets through the end of my elementary years into high school, and sometimes I was legitimately disappointed we didn't make it back home in time to see the highlights from a game we just won . . . Maybe even against division rival Seattle (I was at the game where TD got to 2000 against you! )  Just a reality in a non Internet world, I guess.   That was fucking awesome.  Prime time.  Prime time.  Prime time.   Let the man dance for his fucking record ya cunts, jeez.   Yay a first down!  Oh, he fumbled.    I KNOW I NEED TO BE LESS LAZY.   Good point.  Go fuck yourself.   Personal Foul, Taunting, Offense, #87.  100%.  Isn't that so stupid?   that was hard.  you could get some kind of flukey magic, a turnover-fest, or lose 9-3 to the chiefs at home.     I like "felipe rios"!  I do "Joe Table" and "Pete Waiter" all the time, but never from english to non-english.   i give extra points for the subtle call-back to the original ("run away from the D").   Remember that time when your star receiver said that the solution was to throw him more balls?  And then next week they did and he dropped them all*?  Or how about the time where your running back slipped and hitting the ground caused him to fumble?   The ground.  I mean, it's right there - not moving at all.  maybe protect the rock a little when you're falling down like an asshole.  *hyperbole   No chance.  Manning can't win in the cold.   Definitely not MLA or Chicago guidelines.    even bronco fans know that a fear of blucifer is healthy and justified.   Poncho:  Billy!  You know something.  BIlly:  I'm scared, Poncho.  Poncho:  Bullshit!  You ain't afraid of no man.  Billy:  There's something out there hunting us.  And it ain't no man.       this is going to be like that movie where the creature they made escapes and causes problems.   Just shadows on the cave, friend.  Shadows on the cave.  And our horse shadows shall prevail against the bird shadows!   They totally should've just cast, "He Hate Me" in that role.  I mean who gives a shit?   I think filmmakers get tax credits or something for shooting there.  so, maybe those hollywood types would be a little miffed before just going to Shreveport.   okay, you're right.  The steelers were the first team to ever popularize waving around a towel.  Happy now?   I mean, they only played 14 games back then.  I bet Goodell would kept the ratio the same (1/8th).  So it's 1.75 games for killing your wife.  He could play in the 4th quarter of game 2, with fresh legs while the defense was all tired out.  Seems fair.   richard sherman downvotes comments saying he isn't elite because he disagrees with them, not because they don't add anything to the discussion.   hey, seattle!  our game is going to be blown out of proportion, over-analyzed, and made out to determine the best team in the league . . . in week 3.  then we have to let it sink in over a bye week.  yay   Let's just hope it isn't like *rocky balboa*:  unnecessary and forgettable.   yeah, but that was for another crime, dick!   For what it is worth, Vegas has the line at Seahawks (-4.5), and it is getting a lot of action.  In fact, the Broncos (+4.5) is one of the best bets this week, offering only -105.  I think that's interesting.  I would probably take the points.   I mean, the Colts went 4/13 on third downs in week 1, so I wouldn't be super concerned about it.  It could just be a small sample size and a bit of a statistical anomaly.  Teams will not usually convert so many 3rd and longs, just on average.  That being said, 3rd down is what makes a good defense great - and the Broncos need to focus on and improve that aspect of their game.   Well, Seattle is definitely going to rush the right side of the O-line to go at Clark.  It will be noisy, and he got wrecked in the SB.  So, if he improves at all against the Seahawks, I will count it as a win.  If he doesn't, Peyton may die.   At the tackles, specifically.  Up the middle it looks okay.   Nah, that's an absurd position to hold.  You don't lose by 35 by "Not showing up".  You probably don't lose by 35 by being outplayed, either.  You lose by 35 by getting outplayed AND by "not showing up".  It is definitely both things together forming a perfect storm of shittiness (or awesomeness, depending on your viewpoint).   If Kennan Allen / Eddie Royal have the speed to complete short, quick passes against Sherman, then so does Emmanuel Sanders.  If Antonio Gates can catch three TDs from Phillip Rivers, then "Orange" Julius "Too Strong" Thomas can catch some from PFM.  Oh, and we'll have DT on Maxwell again, the lone bright spot of the Superbowl for our offense.  We'll be fine on offense.  If the defense can keep Seattle less than 40% on third down, I say we win.   No kidding.  If one of the beers pulled their sponsorship (or Nike!), you can bet Goodell would be out on his ass before the fucking ink was dry.   Currently residing in Madison.  Am aware not everyone has an outrageous northern midwest accent.  But every now and then there's a real doozy.   The truth Ertz.   Yes!!!  Gif available?    See?  I like this guy.    No see, bad calls make up 14 points and also playcalling which invites a turnover in the redzone.  Damn refs.  OP.   I can change.  You can change.  WE ALL CAN CHANGE!!!   Oh man.  That would be sweet.   I mean, they still have the Patriots and Bengals from their 1st place finish, then the Steelers and Ravens from the AFC North ( and the Browns sure don't look too shabby either).  And I know the NFC East is kinda the button of a lot of jokes over here, but sometimes those cowboys and Giants teams just decide to show up, and the Indigenous Persons just hung a 40 burger.  And then there is the division which is always a crapshoot (Broncos and Seahawks went 5-1 in their respective divisions last year,  for example).  They will be very fortunate to get to 11-5.  I would take the under.   FINALLY!  Someone got it.   Fair enough.     Was going for the [Ted Nugent band] ( http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damn_Yankees_(band)), but that works, too.   You will be missed.   This is a non - sore loser, here.  /R/NFL, recognize.    I know.  Why cares what sex/gender the prosecutor is?   I have more than one female friend that would suck him off at a moment's notice (it came up in conversation,  okay?).  One male friend,  too. (NOT ME).  (Okay, me).   I don't think Elway can play an instrument . . .   I don't get it.   I am having fun making snooty comments all around.  Way fun.   Unless proceeded by, " . . . A narcotic."   Gruden even called it.  He said any throw needed to be safe.  Boom interception.    I think I owe Satan (or some obscure Norse or Egyptian God) for getting Elway.  I am well aware that six thousand things had to go a certain way for Elway to get traded to the Broncos (and not the Niners, Raiders,  etc), and at least one of them was that Irsay was an incompetent boob dealt a shitty situation by a spoiled brat Stanford Boy who wanted to play baseball for the Yankees.   Just think about his millions of dollars and your tens of dollars.  That will help.   Try out 5.0 yet?  Andrew can be our DM!   Ugh. How moist is it?   You really should capitalize, "King Neck Beard."   Likewise,  friend.  Fuck the Raiders.   Let me check . . . Oh.  It seems that Eagles are 2-0.  Oh my.  Colts are 0-2, as well.  Maybe just move on.   (FYI: Broncos also 2-0)   It isn't nearly as bad as folk are making out.  There was a tug on T.Y.'s jersey that sent him to the floor as an interception happened, and then another tug to Shady ' s jersey that was knee - jerk ed as a whorescollar but wasn't.  Two fairly innocuous mistakes (but still mistakes).  But it wasn't any Superbowl 40 or Replacement refs Hail Mary touchdown.   Weird grudge to hold.  You stole a team, too.   Still better than the 3 point game in hockey.   Still stings?  Yeah, 43-8.  I know.  Still stings.   Shave head.  Solved.    Maybe you even pull 9 a Heisenberg.   Hahahah.  What a dick.  Love it.   I need gif of zoom in on despondent Mr. Neck Beard.   Get fucked lady!   Khaki Man just bought yo groceries!!!  You gotta want it.   Pretty sure my neighbors think I am insane as I yell, "Sproles is too good . . . SPROLES OP . . . PLEASE NERF SPROLES!!!" As that screen unfolded.   "Get a ticket,  and go watch the Eagles play."  I call that for SAS.   He needs to tighten has hat.   Yeah, well, you know,  it's the Radisson, so it's pretty nice.   yeah, that is just inexcusably bad.  We could have had 1 full minute with at least 1 timeout, just in case they score.  Very very bad decisions.    I am happy with the win, for many reasons.  First, it is clear to me that absent many, many mental mistakes, this game would not have been nearly as close.  There were multiple 3rd and longs which were converted, and I put some of that on the defensive playcalling.  Malik's roughing was borderline bs, but still inexcusable.  Offside OMFG.  These are mental mistakes, and not deficiencies in scheme or talent.  You like to see the offense be better in the 2nd half, but so many 3 and outs, dropped balls, poor recognition of audibles has really cost us there.  The O line has been very inconsistent.   Sometimes they look dominant, and sometimes they look awful.  Chris Clark in particular had a horrible game.  But  Ball and C.J. ran well today regardless.  These are all fixable problems, and completely reasonable ones to have in games 1 and 2.  In the end, don't complain about 7 point victories where offense, defense, and special teams all play a significant role in the victory.   Go Broncos and Fuck The Raiders.   This was indeed poor, poor game management by Fox.     This is patently false.  No mere WR foot has a chance against the Manning Fivehead.   To be fair, he found out he had diabetes in his last year with us, and really dialed in his health that year.   Should I buy a PS4?  Semi-serious question.  I could get Destiny and The Last of Us and be happy for once.   I watched that movie on a lark one slow Netflix day, because sometimes things going explodey are fine.  It entertained me.  The main dude is kinda stupid, the acting wasn't any good, and I really didn't understand the alien motivation.  I wont watch it again, but I am not unhappy that I saw it.  Not the most ringing endorsement, perhaps, but better than an actual garbage fire like the most recent Spiderman or, I don't know, Transformers Too-High-A-Number.   Just like the wrong two Beatles died.  (credit to George Carlin, also incorrectly dead)    There's no probably about it.  Did you ever hear about the Rolling Stone interview where they asked Steven Tyler what he thought the essence of Rock   Roll was?  "For me, Rock   Roll has always been about 'The Three Ms':  Music, Money, and Mmmmmmmm, Pussy!"   And Belcher!  There's plenty of misery to go around.   That was Carolina/SF, wasn't it?   MASSIVE penalties for the off-hand there, as I think pitchforks count as large weapons.   I hope you are right, but I would temper that optimism.  I think it is very possible that Goodell runs the old scapegoat play - if the AP reports that so-and-so *definitely* received a copy of the tape, Goodell could pin it all on this "fall guy" for not making the video the attention of everyone.  Not likely anyone would believe him, but this is a reasonable direction to expect.    My grandfather used to say of Chiefs vs. Raiders, "Let's hope for a 0-0 tie, and they kill each other".  Not a man to mince AFC West hatreds.  I look at it another way:  when I loathe both teams, I just root for horrible things to happen to one or both of them (not injuries - I'm not a monster).  I want blocked field goals as time expires, or fumbles on the opening kickoff of overtime, or hail-mary passes from the 50 that get batted up in the air, and then dropped, only to have PI called so that a FB dive can get stuffed on an untimed down from the 1.  [Muffed punts late in the game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USBAqX8QUEg), [huge blown leads](http://youtu.be/iZxSANhjCag?t=4m2s), [apparent fumbled return TDs foiled at the goal line] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjVNzbQF9jA), holding penalties on a 52-yard FG to win the game, [shanked extra points after a Stanford/Cal-like Hook-and-Ladder touchdown to "tie" the game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTGco82JKHo) - these must be your desires when two despised foes go to battle.   China.  Duh.    Not today.   And the coach deserves it.  Horrible game management.    Exactly.  When a team goes for 2 twice - they did something wrong.   I feel like that is a corollary to the YouTube comment rule:  There is no such thing as a youtube comment that is, "too stupid".   My first thought too.   That is always so awkward - I've been at games where it was clear the right call was against the Broncos' best wishes, but I am just one man - I can't tell every chanting hill person to quit their hollerin'.   I like when Boomer does a MNF or playoff baseball.     Solved!  I did this and Chris said that they aren't allowed to do the field-level things this year.  A bummer, but oh well.   Good catch - I knew it was a casino, AKA, a place with some of the greatest surveillance on Earth, but mixed up the actual city.     I feel that *Joe Dirt* is vastly under-rated by the movie-watching public.   Oh, so TMZ can afford to buy the video, but the NFL can't persuade someone to just have access to it?   You know, for a time-sensitive investigation into one if its players?  I call bullshit.  Most likely it went down like this (dramatized and exaggerated):  NFL: A star player hit his fiancee?  In vegas?  In front of how many cameras?  Video-haver:  Yes.  Many angles.  Elevator and everything.  NFL:  Well, should we see that?  Video-haver:  Probably, but it might cost you.  NFL:  Eh, fuck that - we'll make our decision based on hearsay and conjecture.  Those are *kinds* of evidence.   It's the wrong tone.  You do it again, I'll stab you in the face with a soldering iron.   So, I have looked all over the official Broncos website; it seems like they have discontinued the field-level highlights with the audio from the radio broadcast, in favor of having individual highlights with Logan's call.  Does anyone know if this is the direction they'll be going in the future for sure?  Are my field-level highlights all gone forever?   Manning is definitely not super crisp tonight.    It is not cool to just let plays like that go.  Officials you need to pull your heads out of your ass and stop relying on the replay booth to do your goddamn job.  People are going to get hurt chasing down people after a play should have been blown dead.   Honestly, I clicked on this expecting much, much worse.  I was actually reasonably impressed, despite the gigantic mistakes made in these arguments.  Obviously, I despise the conceit of framing the question this way in the first place - it puts defenders of Rand on the back foot and loads the deck against them (but, these two people don't care, and even consider it funny).  Interestingly, as others here have said, the contention that Rand is "nonsense" seems to be largely based on a basic misunderstanding:  Klavin believes that Rand is equivocating "altruism" and "selflessness". Klavin believes that the concept of selflessness is essentially impossible, in that one cannot be truly without self (at least, without dying), but altruism is a good, comprising the good feelings that you have when helping people.  The problem is, Rand never equivocates these concepts - she uses "altruism" as the well-understood ethical concept which has been agreed upon, and goes to show precisely how it **requires** selflessness, which is therefore impossible.  She is not equivocating - she is showing the relationship between the two.  Klavan simply misses the connection because his definition of "altruism" almost equates to "kindness", a phenomenon which Rand wrote and analyzed often.  That is why I was more pleased than I thought it would be.  This is a basic misunderstanding which could be rectified.  It isn't someone arguing from ignorance, mispronouncing Rand's name, and talking about how she condones Rape and killing of the poor.    	105

Also, SumaGrow is a mix of [diazotrophs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diazotroph) (I've read 50+ different strains in some literature, 30+ strains in others). ... but one of their PR guys did a talk at a conference a few years back (can't find the youtube video now, believe it's been pulled... otherwise I'd provide a link) ... but, in it he says that four of the strains included in SumaGrow are PSBs... and because they felt that they had an excellent product built around a very rich understanding of diazotrophs, they were now (then.. the vid is a few years old) beginning to shift their focus towards PSBs... ...no word on what's going on with *that* product line, but *that* the company has pulled the video? (assuming that it was them that did), I'd imagine that this 'revelation' could've been a reason behind it.  Of course PSBs don't 'solve' the peak phosphorus 'deal'... but, from that video and elsewhere, we've been heavily fertilizing with P for over half a century now... ...and, from what I gather, there's actually *plenty* of P in most of the farmed soils.. ...the problem is, it's not bioavailable for the plants.  The P in fertilizer-form is readily available for the plants, and/or breaks down quickly in such that *becomes* readily available for plants... ...but, that this 'window of availability' closes by the end of the season due to P's affinity to binding with other 'elements' in the soil (be them individual elements or larger molecules)...  ....and, the bond-types that it forms are too strong for plants-alone to break.  this is where the PSBs come in... with their 'hammer   cleave' enzymatic 'action', they're able to break the P free, use it for 'whatever' reason they use it for... and when they die, the P that they freed up is now in a bioavailable form for the plants to utilize ... before the process repeats itself (either binding to other elements... ...or becoming usurped by yet more PSBs... ...or being utilized by the plant).  With that, there's 'supposedly' *decades* of phosphorus in the soils... ... it's just a matter of making it (bio)available for the plants ... thus, biological fertilizers (fungal, microbial, 'etc') ....  this drastically increases efficiency, and can prob help make it to the end of the century before 'Peak P' becomes a '*huge*' issue...   even sticking with the seemingly accepted date of 2027 being 'Peak P year' ...

(remove the salt... an obvious industry   product in   of itself) and provide the minerals as a*nother* product for ... well... the ag industry to utilize.   Personally? I don't *really* see peak P as being a *huge* issue.... .... per se.... but definitely something worthy of being aware of (imo), as well, something that should be included in adjustments around ag approaches.

Plus these explosives are tiny  and, oftentimes so are their victims (see last link)  tiny? and accurate!? you're definitely getting the idea now!   ... and w/*out* the countless other tiny little bombs that *aren't* needed   you can use a small warhead to penetrate the armor and destroy it  sounds smart.  so, one could use a small bomb intelligently placed to take out a tank? vs dropping lots of them? crazy!  ...and we don't get the unexploded bomblet deal that blows up civilians? poisons the environment? and dismembers little kids? wow! we're talkin' progress!!

I understand them pretty well :)   It's an anti-vehicle weapon  with reports of it being dropped in civilian areas   If you were to use one normal 1,000 pound bomb, you would expect to destroy one target. It's just massive overkill when you have a bomb which can destroy over ten vehicles with the same size payload.  are there not lighter bombs than 1'000 pound'ers?   which can destroy over ten vehicles with the same size payload  which is 'great' when it's not in a heavily populated civilian area and you need to take out 10 vehicles at once.   which roasts everything inside of it instantaneously.  I was under the impression that the gases were also poisonous as hell?  that first link (EFP) looks a helluva lot smaller and more accurate than a 1'000lb bomb  last link? still looks a helluva lot smaller than a 1k# bomb  to understand what I'm trying to convey?  I repeated myself like 5x. you may be mixing up my message with others?    I said: if they have this greatly described system of accuracy   such... can't they also apply that to *other* 'bombs' besides *just* cluster bombs?  in such a way that it doesn't have to be used on *just* cluster bombs?   and, if so, it seems like possibly even more accurate, smaller, and thus less potential for collateral damage weapons *than* cluster bombs... could be possible.   ...ie, like the two *much* smaller than 1k# weapons you provided links to.     x-post: /r/materials   x-post: /r/waste   read: they just got their new database management software and AI in place and are smarter than ever now   x-post: /r/agriculture   [Hyperglycemia modulates extracellular amyloid- concentrations and neuronal activity in vivo](http://www.jci.org/articles/view/79742?)

I feel like reviving LFTRs would make more sense than building another PBMR  ... these things make sense for some country that wants to become a bit more independent, wants to create stability to their country's energy infrastructure while also remaining a bit independent ... and, wanting to also send a very clear message to the world that they're both 'advanced' (enough to do nuclear) but also 'not looking to fight' ... and, even, instead... looking to help 'clean-up' the problems of the world (by not only *not* making weapons grade fuel... but by actually helping to burn some *up*) .... very practical design but kinda just 'safe   boring'  ....and I don't feel any real progress per se towards the advancement of nuclear reactor design-types ... ...vs LFTRs or, say, throwing money behind a Bussard Polywell.  I just gather that LFTRs can burn up a *lot* more nuclear waste ... and a *lot* faster ... while also helping serve to 'clean up' the nuke industry   [Intracranial Mapping of a Cortical Tinnitus System using Residual Inhibition](http://www.cell.com/current-biology/abstract/S0960-9822\(15\)00278-X)   well, molten salt's just an energy carrier... like water or oil or other...  you can technically do a molten salt reactor with 'anything' that'll heat the specific salt-type up ... coal, n.gas, geothermal, solar, etc  more talking LFTR's specifically ...   edit: clearly I was being an idiot.   yeah. I mean molten salt reactors.   but... i had my part in the step wrong.  I was thinking about using molten salt as the heat medium, *not* ... ... the reactor itself.  You're right.  but, I was more-referring to LFTRs specifically vs MSRs in their more general sense   been in the construction industry a *long* time... you meet people.   or, you get a license and get it yourself. ... or, you could always make a bomb, but i'm not sure black powder has enough of a 'kick' to do it right.   could always get some stump remover, burn it down, or hire a stump remover crew to come take it out for you.  the gasoline trick works too... for burning it down.  just soak it in gasoline... as much as you can ... drill some holes to really get it in there... and just let it soak. keep throwing a bit more on there then let it soak in and repeat ... amount depends on stump size.  but, this works a lot better when it's cold out... the gas may evaporate away too quickly otherwise.  ... kerosene works too, it's heavier, sits longer, but it's also thicker and doesn't soak in as well.   then just light it... depending on how much you soaked in you may need to create a 'fuse' or something just 'cause it may burst pretty big ... I've heard grill fluid works too but i've never tried it.  once you burn it down (it will most *definitely* smoke.. a lot... but if you aren't worried about blasting with dynamite i seriously doubt you'll be worried about some smoke ... once it gets going you could always set up a charcoal grill near it to try   cover it up? grill some burgers while you watch it burn down?)   once it's burned down you can usually just kick the rest of it in and shovel it up.   ... or throw on more gas and keep burning   I was talking about dynamiting tree stumps   Yeah, we only lost one tree out of the ~50 we ever transplanted.  ...but the 'crunching sound' still just seems painful.  I also made it a point to start using PHC Tree Saver after that first one died. ...it was probably the second or third one we ever used it on and it may've been too big to transplant.   You can use it for both, but there are stumped grinders for stump removal.  More fun though is using a quarter stick of dynamite   a drill  I've moved many trees with one of these (used to own one). What's *not* captured by the gif is the sound! The tree roots are *not* fans.  ...and it's *rarely* **that** clean of a process.  Grinding stumps (had a stump grinder too) is no where near as fun as blowing it up.   it was a joke  ... don't get all puffy.   I used to be a big fan of the concept behind PBMR's ... I mean, compared to what's actually in-use, what's *not* to love?  ....but, then the 'thorium fanboy madness' struck the nuclear energy world and...well... Comparatively, thorium, on paper at least, just makes more sense to direct the finite amount of funding available towards pursuing *that* line of R D ...vs PBMRs.  Obviously that's just an opinion (mine), but logistically, it seems a more fruitful   efficient line of investment     you should post this in /r/Vermiculture     x-post: /r/soil   x-post: /r/soil   something akin to [this](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser_microphone), but with video-analysis vs lasers?   What about expanded gun rights built around a sensible approach towards gun control?  Or vice versa?  Expanded gin control built around a sensible approach towards gun (ownership) rights?   Makes sense. I'm sure the US has similar target-types in Russia...China, Iran, France, Britain, and even within itself if you run out to the roughest drafts of possible targets.  Wired had a great piece in one of their issues back in ~'02-'04 that covered how lil'Bush was updating our nuclear targets the world over. The map(s) they showed in it made pretty much the entire planet a target in one contingency or another.

I think you totally misinterpreted my intention there!   I wasn't 'comparing' the two in that way, was more just trying to say that people sitting around and accepting that things are they way they are doesn't lead to progress.  There has been a *lot* of progress towards autism. ... and, though a '100% bang-on '*cure*'' hasn't been discovered, there have been a lot of breakthroughs on both the understanding of the physiology of it, as *well* the behavioral understandings and therapeutic approaches towards helping those with it adjust and adapt in ways that *wouldn't* have likely been 'discovered' or 'developed' had people simply 'accepted' the understandings of it prior *to* those willing   wanting to evolve said understanding.  I wasn't trying to ... do what you are implying that I was.  I also haven't really even stated my point of view on it for you to know whether I've changed it or *not*. but, after multiple exchanges and no real advancement in conversation, I'm in agreement that ending any future discussion about it is probably the best course at this point.   They have transcripts for a lot of their other videos around the site, I'm sure if you sent them a request for transcripts for these they'd do them.  There aren't that many video-interviews with her out there (or at least there weren't last time I checked), and clearly her claims have stirred up a lot of public interest... I'm sure they'd comply if they got a request to.     That's where the "cure autism" movement comes from, people who don't accept autistics.  or just don't like sitting around and dealing with a set of scenarios as life has seen fit to hand to them .. ..people tend to like to be more proactive than that.  I can't blame them. 100 years ago, polio was a problem. Now, polio's less of a problem.  change what you can, accept what you can't.  we didn't go to the moon because we simply accepted that it was too far away.   how would it not?   If we knew with 100% certainty how it's caused, it seems like we could do something about it.  wouldn't acceptance come *through* awareness of it to know *to* accept it?  edit: here's [the link to the interview-videos](https://www.ihealthtube.com/aspx/contributors.aspx?sp=335) with Stephanie Seneff.   I think being able to see her body language, her syntax, her vocal emphasises, etc puts a face to all the headlines, articles, 'coverage in general' surrounding her.   Was behind a car just yesterday with an Autism Awareness state-issued license plate.  Not enough interest in autism: people think the lack of attention   ignorance towards it is ridiculous and run 'campaigns' to 'raise awareness'   Too many papers published with too many different theories: people complain that there's too much going on with it  Really a no win all around   She was interviewed on ihealthtube.com a few months back...and though I question the merits of both this article, as well any direct correlations between glyohosphate   autism, and esp any direct glyphosphate has with *causing* autism, her interview was 'interesting' to watch nonetheless.  I'll try to remember to provide a direct link to it when I get a chance.  edit: [the link to her interviews](https://www.ihealthtube.com/aspx/contributors.aspx?sp=335)   original paper: [CyTOF supports efficient detection of immune cell subsets from small samples.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25450003)   wall o'text - part II  ~~about to run out of characters~~ ran out of characters but... the point of all of that was, this starts to cut into the fossil fuel demand, while at the same time fitting very nicely *in*to its infrastructure (syngas *is* short for synthesis gas after all... and, as such, can be up-converted *to* methane and ethane and.. well, like cool planet's doing, 'grassoline') if not straight replace it...     biomass gasification in such that biochar is a resulting product is not just the only form of energy out there that's carbon *negative*, it's also pretty much the only *thing* that's out there that's carbon negative... that's not just been used every day for centuries, but that's been made naturally since lighting caught the first field on fire before the subsequent thunderstorm put out the fire before it all burned to ash.   um, well, since i have a whole new set of room here....   let me expand on that.  solar, wind, geothermal, hydroelectric (tidal and other included), subsequent [energy storage](/r/energystorage) ...nuclear   fusion -even are, at best, carbon neutral.   and, in truth, there are *so* many parts of that process along the manufacturing   servicing lines of those respective industries that are carbon+, they're not really a solution to the 125-150 ppm carbon increase over the past 150+ years.     really, in truth, *only* something like this will do it. and, on an industrial scale.  but, it isn't just that this is carbon neutral or carbon negative, if scaled up to the level we've al*ready* scaled up our corn   soy industries for the production of biofuel, it almost-entirely neutralizes at least the US's carbon emissions from transport fuels.     ...almost, but not quite.  it'd need to be scaled up farther.. unfortunately... because that means imposing on yet *more* yet-to-be-touched lands... and, again, like how solar/wind/geothermal/etc have a 'smaller footprint' relative to clean energy.. *though* countless acres of cultivated switchgrass fields are *more*-friendly than corn, soy, oil fields, or coal mines... they're still not 'natural'.   so, there's kinda-sorta that aspect of the whole thing.  ...it still has an environmental footprint, is my point to it.  um, from an energy-required perspective, [Algenol](http://www.algenol.com/) and others are doing *awesome* work with [algae](/r/algae).  a google search on the health benefits   superfood qualities of chlorella and spirulina will be quick to show the potentials with *that* approach from a food perspective ... .... but, on a *fuel* angle, Algenol honestly is superior to switchgrass, miscanthus, hemp, and any other 'super crop' out there.    Algenol's ceo touts repeatedly in [this video series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlSwFaxIyzo) that every acre of Algenol far outpaces corn/soy.  I believe the average amount of ethanol from corn is like 150-170 (160?) gallons per acre per year and ~57 gallons of biodiesel per acre of soy  .... lets be nice and combine those into a single field for crop rotation.. though this isn't the case.  that's 225 gallons of each a year in a mixed bag (I'm being nice   rounding up)  The CEO of Algenol repeatedly touts 9'000 gallons of ethanol per acre per year *plus* an additional ~1'500 gallons a year from a mixed bag of longer hydrocarbon chains ... from pure hydrogen   methane (shorter) all the way up to diesel's c20H42 ... and all the fuel types in between (kerosene, jet fuel, .... 'gasoline' even).  so, 10'500 gallons of 'fuel' per acre per year.  vs corn/soy's politely rounded up 225.     now, algenol's process is closer to the carbon neutral side of things... though, they *do* buy CO2 from power plants to make it carbon negative... i see it as a great mix with switchgrass... and have heard rumor that Cool Planet's facilities in Louisiana and Algenol's Florida facilities are in talks for hybriding their approach on future designs... though, that could just be rumor fodder.  but badass rumor fodder! and the kinda stuff that even if it *is* 'just-rumor' that'll hopefully the type that gets something going?  but, you can set up algenol facilities on places you wouldn't even think to set up switchgrass facilities so... there's that aspect as well.   I see it as a 'scaled model'... going with the solve for x video diagrams   representations Mike Cheiky showed... you could do a central processing ring of facilities... surrounded by a ring of algenol... surrounded by a ring of switchgrass greenhouses... surrounded by an outermost ring of field-grown switchgrass.... and both increase those circle-sizes, as well give them a new reason to 'awe' us as we [fly over them](http://goo.gl/iM3u3w).   but... algenol's algae could always be 'cooked down' to provide raw hydrogen (it *is* more hydrogen dense and/or faster growing than switchgrass) ... for *that* aspect of the fuel... ...but, it's no where *near* lignocellulosic enough (not even sure you can call it 'lignocellulosic') for biochar production... all the carbon would just straight-gasify.  you'd get no to essentially-no biochar from it.  so, thus, carbon neutral at best.   even the 'carbon negativity' of it is... temporary... as, sure the smokestack CO2 makes it carbon negative ... but, when you burn the fuels from it, it's carbon neutral.   need the biochar for carbon negativity.    at that... switchgrass.   this stuff is awesome at soil building.   the roots grow as deep to deeper than what's above ground.  when harvested, the photosynthesis (or lack there of ... the crop's been cut down to ~6 inches) can't support the roots below... the plant chemically cauterizes them off... if they're big enough, they take hold and become a new plant. most die... decompose in the soil.  ...adding to the SOC (soil organic carbon) there.   98% of the carbon in a plant is from the CO2 inhaled. inevitably there's some in the water the plant pulls in.  a plant is built from the air.  the roots included.  those now-dying-dead-decomposing roots help improve the soil quality and retain nutrients.  2/3rds of carbon is in the soil.  the healthier soil will enrich   promote more soil biota... and sequester *far* more carbon than both the plant *and* the biochar could ever hope to.  the biochar will just help to keep it all there longer.  i'm cutting this rant short. it's more than too long as is. but i'm out of time and it's the second part to the already-sent last one   here, check this vid out  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkYVlZ9v_0o  It's 'old' at this point... Cheiky is someone who they brought in to do initial PR for them, to help raise capital for where they were at the time ... ...to get to where they are now...  they've 'moved forward' since, and I haven't seen anything about him in their media for about 2 years? ... but that's his m.o., he's more an initial / ground-work funding type of guy.  but, their 'first official plant's' ribbon cutting ceremony was back in Sept '14.... and they're moving forward more with their biochar product.    ...I can't find their ribbon cutting ceremony vid to give you a link but... ....biochar isn't going to be their main deal. like, they aren't going to run it to produce biochar (most of the time).  ...but, inevitably there'll be *some* char produced.  ....and they've steadily been increasing their biochar product and biochar product pr... though most of that seems focused on their california facilities (their 'trial' facilities) not their mississippi/ Louisiana operations, though it seems capable of it from how it sounds...  ...from their president's remarks in the opening ribbon cutting deal.  but, their model is 'modular' and set up for a kinda-sorta decentralized distribution of facilities... scaling up each site in size, as well as developing multiple sites around.  but, this makes sense with biomass... ...it's not dense enough to justify shipping it very far (as Cheiky says in the Google Solve For X video).  *If* the model is advanced forward from where it was in the solve for x vid though... ...and the switchgrass is grown *not* for liquid transport fuels (or less for it anyway)...  ...and it's instead grown for its 'raw energy content' (read: hydrogen / syngas production), and their 'ovens' are more set to just 'cook' the switchgrass and produce a lot of char and a lot of syngas...  ...and the process is tied into something like GE's CO2 fertilization designs  1) [link 1](http://goo.gl/szx2yi)  2) [link 2](http://goo.gl/02ky5F)  3) [link 3](http://goo.gl/7lhrwX)  whereby the 'waste heat' produced is used to first dry the incoming materials (need to get the biomass at a 15% moisture content level ... think 'dry or aged firewood') and then use the other 'waste heat' produced in a co-generation or tri-generation set up (to heat or to cool a greenhouse or other facility) ... the syngas to power a turbine first producing power for the production facilities, then the greenhouse lighting, fan, etc facilities, and then selling the rest on the grid as electricity... ....or selling/blending the syngas either as a n.gas substitute, or blending it with n.gas kinda like ethanol w/ gasoline ...     ...the problem with doing this with syngas is it's pretty much CO+H2   ... and H2 just doesn't store well. it's too small.  it's better to straight-burn the H2 or separate out the CO... well, first, step up the CO to CO2 (catalytic converter) and then 'distill' it out ... the CO2 weighs a *lot* more than the H2 so they can be separated ... albeit, at expense... and then the H2 can be handled as 'hydrogen is handled'  ... toyota's hydrogen cars, for example, or other hydrogen markets.. ...or, again, probably best just straight-burned on site (again, just too expensive to store it) and then the electricity put onto the grid... .... like solar/wind vs n.gas.  it's a lot easier to [store](/r/energystorage) n.gas than it is electricity ... cheaper too... ...and then just 'hold off on' the n.gas until this isn't there or burn the n.gas to supplement where these facilities aren't meeting local demand.  but, this stuff first... n.gas making  up the rest.  ..but, design [the grid](/r/thegrid) that renewables (like this) take priority over electricity from 'fossil fuels' ....  anyway, the CO2 separated out of the gas stream... the CO stepped up to CO2... and separated out .... ... can be used to feed the greenhouses (*not* mentioned in the solve for x video) .... now, of course, the *main* market for these is going to be for food-crops. they're simply going to bring in more money.   ...and I'll let ge's much better funded (I do this as a 'hobby') marketing team explain the science   benefits behind that (for more, google: 'greenhouse carbon fertilization' or 'co2 greenhouse fertilization' or something along those lines... ge isn't the *only* company doing this (can't find the link I was looking for).   ... well, food crops are both smarter and higher value for this... ...then, indoor switchgrass facilities.   obviously greenhouses of switchgrass isn't the greatest idea from a profit perspective, but with it, you can increase from an average of 2.5 harvests a year (2 one year, 3 the next... average 2.5 harvests... for switchgrass)... to about 4 harvests a year.   but, not just that, the switchgrass grows *much* faster, so, each harvest being faster growing it's closer to *five* harvests a year in volume vs outdoor grown switchgrass (I set up /r/switchgrass to post links like this.... to make them easier to find *and* to link to but, unfortunately, I did a lot of that research be*fore* I set up /r/switchgrass, and haven't gotten back around to doing it again... so, you'll just need to do the research yourself to back up those results but it'll be somewhere in searches like: 'switchgrass greenhouse growth rates' and the such. i know that reads like a cop out, but, trust me, it's out there... ...mostly in published journal papers. not fun nor easy to pick through).  but, yeah, the thing with it is... *if* done that way, there's a *near*-100% loop in it all.   The sulfur (that biogas so notoriously contains) is filtered out of the gas stream via desulfurization... and turned *back* into sulfur-product for field application (sulfur's an *extremely* [important element for plants](http://www.gardeningknowhow.com/garden-how-to/soil-fertilizers/sulfur-in-plants.htm)).   um, the atmosphere is ~79% N... you can't pull in air from the outside world to mix in the turbine's fuel-to-air ratio w/*out* N being there... ...thus, subsequently, there're NxOx's that need to be broken down... as well CO molecules that need to be upgrade-completed to CO2 ... ie, after the gas stream is desulphurized, send the exhaust through a catalytic converter ([essentially](http://goo.gl/Io5Xqt)) ... but, *don't* release it....  the resulting CO2 is fertilizer, the O2 is... lessened anyway, obviously less of a priority to keep but since you're sorting your gases might as well do something with it, there's of course an industry for pure O2, H2O... pure water? yeah, there's a market for that... if nothing else, it's water for your crops / greenhouses, and the N2 .... ....N2 is the form plants need nitrogen to be in.  [microbes called diazotrophs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diazotroph) utilized in produces like [SumaGrow](http://www.sumagrow.com/) sprayed onto the crops (read: switchgrass) take the increased N2 being pumped into the greenhouse ... along with the CO2... and pull it into the soil and make it available for the plants.   (great time to reference the importance of sulfur here).   this pretty much recycles the vast majority of the emissions from the biochar gasification right back into growing more crops for energy   biochar ... ...and, of course, the other result from all of this *is* .. biochar.    which can then be incorporated into the soils of both the greenhouses or fields... or sold as product. ... or both, just depending on how they want to go about it. ...and the market for it.  lastly is the inevitable amount of flyash produced.   ash is minerals. the potash industry is still in a bit of a glut right now, but... that ash can be mixed right back with the biochar and... incorporated back into the soil.  it was in the switchgrass for a reason: the plants pulled it into themselves.   they do this because they need it... so, add it back into the soils and the next crop can do it again.   do this on a wide enough scale... read: build enough greenhouses... or just open fields.. but, up-convert the open fields into a greenhouse model where funding allows (again, it's more efficient and allows for production year-round... so, cost wise it *does* pay for itself, it's just a little lower profit margins vs open-field... ..but, it can be invested-in from a 'efficiency perspective'  ... like paying more money up front to retrofit a field or a building... only to have it pay itself back in savings over the next few years.  sure it costs more out of pocket... but, sometimes it's better to invest in what you have and upgrade it rather than to continue to expand like a necessary biochar producing switchgrass cancer on the landscape.  it also allows for more energy in a denser format and, as such, more land to be returned to a more-natural order.   as great as switchgrass is, and as 'native' of a grass it is, esp over corn   soy.. it's still a monoculture crop... and, though animals can utilize it quite comfortably   effectively, it doesn't compare to the natural polyculture of a field.... but, with the essential doubling in energy produced from a greenhouse, as well the upgrading of outdoor/non-greenhouse'd fields with the biochar produced from both ... more land *can* be returned to a more natural form.      They are: Cool Planet  It's beginning to scale up.  There's obvious resistance of course. It goes against the profits of existing, well established, deeply entrenched industries that are better subsidized and have a lot more money.    the tl;dr of that: I feel there's no real need for subsidies because the benefits will far outweigh the costs in that the farm will quickly recoup any initial 'hits' they take out of pocket for making, purchasing, and implementing it.     Oh I didn't know there was a subreddit for that thanks!  there's a sub for it, unfortunately I'm the only one who ever really posts to it.  I'm also the mod so... help me out! find good articles about it and post away! :)   IMO widespread implementation of biochar subsidies  in truth? I don't even think the subsidies are necessary.  Personally, I think subsidies are, for the most part, a bad idea... and, shy of going into a long-ass tirade about them, I think that *any* subsidies should have an ~2 year scale-in (tests   market-prep for wide-scale deployment) period, followed by a 3 year actual subsidy period... ...followed by 2-5 years of forced-votes-to-renew scale downs.  ok, so, i'll take that a little farther, but still try to contain my wall o'text on the subject.  after initial tests (universities and such) an ~2 year scale up from smaller-scale university testing overlaps that is pre- the ~2 year subsidy period... ....this is basically where farms working with universities are able to scale up from the acreage of the private-farm dedicated to the university trials is able to scale up from the, say, '50 acres' initially covered to the, say, 500-5'000 acres of the farm (if the farmer/university choose to scale up to something like that) ... ....and, just to give the industry of what*ever* is being subsidized an initial gov't assist   pre-set customer to 'get itself going' as production capacity is put in place and starts... ...so, that's the ~2 year scale-up.  then, 3 years of hardened subsidies towards it. grants, subsidies, as well tax breaks and gov't-supported loan programs with banks   such.   .... 3 years of this at 'whatever percentage' ... ...and, then, 2 more years (more +1, +1) where it's voted on to extend that '3 year period' ... but it *has* to be voted on, it can't just be 'earmarked to continue' (this is how subsidies become permanent policy!)   and, during that +1, +1 years, *start* a phase-down in gov't support (so, instead of say a 100% tax break on capital invested, make it something like 75% the first +1 years, then 50% the second +1 year) ... then, if it's working, things are going good... ...*may*be do another '3 year scaledown' in support for it... but, again, each year it *has* to be voted on.. and a max 10-year cap of support outside of typical biz loan-support   tax breaks on capital investments.   .... so, ~2+3+1+1 ...  and, in these last 3 years, it's voted on *to* scale down... ..progressively, with a 'tapering off' in support over those 3 additional years... lower % tax breaks, less gov't-backed loans, less support for the industry itself producing whatever it is (and this can be biochar as much as oil or n.gas... and, be it equipment suppliers to drillers to equipment suppliers for purchasers ... to possibly the 'material' itself (gas, oil, whatever)) ...  the idea being that there are *no* 'permanent subsidies' (or other gov't backed financialized incentives ... tax breaks, gov't-backed loans, ... to both the developers/producers, as well the consumers) ... like has happened with oil.  A new 'technology' would be invested in to get researched, would get invested in to 'get going' (with support from subsidies, tax breaks, gov't-backed loans, etc) ... but would taper down and, either it stands on its own, or it fails... ...or it more likely lingers somewhere in the background hovering between that product/industry that's still around but no where near as 'big a deal' as it was... ...wind, solar, geothermal, etc as well shoudl be included in this.  my reasoning   rationale behind this... and, this specifically to biochar -even... despite being an obvious *huge* supporter   fan of biochar (again, just note the posting history at /r/biochar and who posts most of the stuff there... and realize that that goes well past reddit's cut off point on the history-of-posts that show up)... ....i don't think it's 'needed' longer than that.  ...and, quite possibly, in the case of biochar, I don't think it's really needed *any*way.  the reason is this: the stuff, when made right and implemented correctly, more than easily pays for itself.  and *there*in lay it's real 'crux' ... ...if there could be some sort of a 'student loan' type of biz-loan.   that could be deployed with, say, an extension office... whereby the farm using the stuff can *go* to their farm-lender, their farm-friendly   knowledgeable bank, or their non-profit or other set up around this... ...get a gov't-backed -type loan, but with a 'you gotta work with the extension office for proper implementation to meet required specs' (just to both help the farmer make sure they're implementing it correctly, as well, to increase the assurances   likelihood that the whole thing will actually *work* .. as well just to provide some 'good advice' and to throw some cash the extension offices way.. i like extension offices   officers. everyone i've met seems really nice, informative, willingly-and-wantingly helpful, and enthusiastic to help anyone seeking their assistance) ... ... um, with that, say a '3 year grace period' from the time the loan is initiated to 'buy' the biochar ... with the possibility of a '2 year extension' ... so, say, for 3 years, they get a 'no-payment, no-interest accrued' loan... and, by the 4th year, they have to start making payments and the principal starts accruing interest .... ...and, say, a 5 year payback period from there or something.. ....this gives the char some time to age, the soil some time to 'normalize' if the char wasn't incorporated in such a way as to immediately *add* to the soil... ...and, the farmer a way to get the loan, get some time before having to take the hit on it, and some time for the benefits of the char to start returning to the farmer in such a way that the savings the char provides (water, fertilizes, remediation of the soil, etc) to have added up. ... in such that the farmer is really out of pocket 'nothing' that they wouldn't've been anyway ...and with much healthier soil, providing a larger yield off of less inputs.. and with less ancillary costs from run off, loss of inputs, and environmental damage to surrounding areas.  ...  the 'carbon negativity' is just an added bonus, as is the rest of the benefits of biochar really.. ...  but, I ultimately see the farms that incorporate biochar will be much like the farms that started using tractors.  Initially it was a bit cumbersome, there was a learning period as tractor tech evolved, and as infrastructure was put in place on the farm *to* support the changes the tractor provided (larger yields, faster, closer plowing, but diesel, barn to store it in, necessary maintenance costs, etc) ... but, in the end, those that incorporated the tractor may've done so out of convenience (like biochar... it just provides less work) or may've simply done so out of *necessity* ... hard to keep up with labor costs and/or other when you're out there breaking your back with a horse   plow while the guy the next farm/field over has plenty of time to sit on his tractor drinkin' a beer after a short-period plowing to watch you breakin' both you *and* your horse's back plowing the field... with the farmer sayin' to himself   his hands, 'Bob over there ain't got too many years left in 'im.. and with the savings from this here Deere, I'm gonna have enough to *easily* buy those fields at auction... or from his wife when she's hard pressed for cash and tired of nursin' ol' Bob there 'cause he can't work no more' ... read: those who don't won't be able to afford to keep up with those who do, and the subsequent dropping in prices that'll be afforded...  ...and those who do will simply buy up those who don't ... and incorporate it in.    the only realistic way that we can do anything about the CO2 problem  making all the biochar we can make will only help slow the tide relative to what we're emitting..... the badass thing about biochar is though that it's both a carbon negative approach (and pretty much the *only* carbon negative approach out there .. ..that's realistically implementable)  *and* an energy 'source'.   making biochar makes [syngas](/r/syngas) and syngas can be either blended with [n.gas](/r/naturalgas) or straight swapped with it (think ethanol with gasoline) .... so, thus, *while* removing carbon, we'd *also* be producing energy.   ....and, if implemented correctly (read: [switchgrass](/r/switchgrass), we can do it fast, widespread, and in a pretty environmentally-friendly way (switchgrass is a native grass and provides a habitat for a *lot* of the natural wildlife that was there... ...vs corn.  and its growth cycle pretty much coincides *with* the local wildlife of the ares... meaning, while it's growing it's providing food, protection, ...habitat .. and when it's harvested (using standard hay bailing equipment) ... is when the wildlife are usually moved on (birds) or old enough to fend for themselves (spring-babies become fall 'adults') or go into hibernation and such anyway.  switchgrass also has an EROEI of about 10x that of corn... so, 1/10th the land, or 10x the energy off the same amount of land.. ...and, it's broadcast seeded and can grow on land you would *never* think to take a plow to, let a*lone* plant corn/soy on.  ...and, [switchgrass](http://goo.gl/7EzI4c) is one helluva [soil](soil) builder in   of its [own right](http://goo.gl/yZDhw8) ... which holds a ton of carbon in   of itself... and pulls a ton of carbon *out* in   of itself.   ... plus it can be used to provide pulp for paper making, building, etc (if you don't make char out of it).  I like hemp, don't get me wrong, and help oil is a great long-chain hydrocarbon (where switchgrass is more ethane-down-to-hydrogen) ... but, it doesn't really compare nor compete against switchgrass, imo. and i'm a pretty big fan of hemp.      /r/biochar   /r/biochar   personally, I think this is disgusting and a complete waste of resources.  introduce a few other variables into the loop and that meat'll turn into something natural and delicious   Compost tea is your friend. Buy, brew, find,  'whatever' the hell  out of everything and you should be fine.  Probably *better* than 'fine' if you weren't going to add compost tea before and this motivates you to do so...  ...but, like the rest of the comments have already said, the bleach itself will break down quickly-enough, if it hasn't already. Just be sure to use rain water and not tap water as much as possible...don't want to add more chlorine or chloramine if at all possible   don't worry, [biochar](/r/biochar)'s already here :)   isn't that what killed Bob Marley?

Your posted link had zero information about estimated evaporation losses due to turfgrass irrigation.  that's because I honestly care very little about the evaporative losses due to turfgrass irrigation. It's just one of a vast multitude of areas that evaporative losses from irrigation is an issue.   that you'd even single it out is 'weird' in   of itself.   ...that you'd single it out and *then* mention it while providing no link relative to it? a complete waste of time   space.  it's essentially useless to've even mentioned it to be honest with you.    I apparently tried harder than you did  and yet found nor provided *nothing*.   and, at that, maybe you found nothing because no one cares enough to focus on it on that semantic enough of a level to leave out the 'countless' other areas 'evaporative losses due to irrigation' can *also* apply.   again, just reinforcing the asininity of even bringing it up to begin with ... let alone complete lack of providing a link relating to it.  douchebag? really? 1) I'm pretty sure that such things are against the rules of 'proper reddiquette'  and 2) douchebag is the person who responds to a needlessly stupid subject (brought up by someone who then provides no link *after* bringing it up) with a link at least *some*what relating to said stupid subject matter .  may want to look in the mirror there, buddy.   I live on clay soils  congrats. many people do ... and I'd imagine you would.. as i'd imagine they'll continue to remain that way from the level of foresight I've seen you provide up to this point on how to avoid them, as well, level of knowledge required on how to reduce or dilute them by working   building SOC   SOM into them.   don't lecture me about them  frankly? I'll say whatever the hell I want to to someone who's reduced our dialogue to name calling and complete idiocy.    You assume if the soil holds 25% more water, then you'll need 25% less water to do the same watering?  no. I don't assume that.    I have no idea where to start  that you even realize there's something there from which *to* start a response is an amazement to me at this point.   Thats honestly how you retards come up with your success numbers isn't it?  again, that reddiquette thing.    the only savings will be from decreased evaporation  yet, evaporation is still a variable, right? otherwise, why would you have even brought it up in your *last* message?   blah blah blah  and my response to it: all of that is 'blah blah blah' at this point. not even worth acknowledging that you flapped your mouth some more   This is science, and once good university science catched up with your biochar crap, you'll disappear too.  there's plenty of 'good university science'  published in a multitude of papers both supporting *and* detracting from the 'buzz' around biochar. You *could* try linking to some of the detracting ones to reinforce your 'blah blah blah' above and you wouldn't look like such an idiot. ...but, at this point, I'd imagine someone like you has gotten *so* used to looking like one that you'd really have no idea how to handle *not*.  so, it doesn't surprise me that you *don't* find some of the 'good university science' backing up your sentiments.  trust me, they're out there... there're plenty posted by me to /r/biochar.    you'll disappear too  unlikely    lol  did you really say 'this is science'??? you're a fucking idiot. seriously. a. fucking. idiot. that you just considered your opinion to be science.  and you call *me* a douchebag! ha!   edit: and, frankly, at this point, me even wasting my time responding to you make me one too    it may come down to them actually running out of water  do you realize how much the land all those farms is sitting on???   LA used to be farms. look at it now.   Rage Against the Machine has that line in [one of their songs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFCiIkDv-sM), 'kill them off, take their land, and go there for vacation'  or, more, kill off the farms, buy up their land at auction on the courthouse steps, develop it, sell it, and use the money to buy a vacation home somewhere.  Truthfully, I'd imagine that it'd be difficult even for the '*responsible*' farmer in California to make it in this climate (both environmental   economic).  .... maybe not bankruptcy or default-level but, there's a lot of pressure right now. 'survival of the fittest' is definitely in play there ... be the fittest sound practices, or politically connected... or just strategically placed (grandfathered water rights, etc).  I've met more than a few people who've swooped in to buy property for 'pennies on the dollar' once the crunch has come in. I, myself, have done it in fact. It's a bit of a scum-bucket thing to do but... not at the same time, it just depends on how it's handled.  My grandfather managed a farm here for 40+ years. The initial farm was ~3500 acres, but after WWII, between the soldiers that didn't return to the ones that did to a climate they couldn't adapt to (ptsd played its part in this, i'm sure) to 'whatever' other reasons, the owner of the farm started coming in and buying up farms from farmers that were going into default.  Each had their own deal but, all in all, the acreage 'brokered' was something like 15k... many were able to work the land and pay it back, others couldn't but were 'hired on' to continue working their own land, others turned and walked away. It was spread across dozens to possibly a few hundred farms overall... all in the same small county...   but, up to about '55-'60, it *finally* started to work its way through... and the '~3'500 acre' original farm had settled on something like 5'500 acres, the other ~10'000+ acres having been... most of it's just real estate/houses schools, small stores, offices etc... such as the past 50 years of suburban creep is about, but... well, the 5'500 acres? it'll prob be that for *quite* some time as the family my grandfather was working for made *quite* a bit of money during that period of time...  I can't watch what's going on in California and *not* think about 'Chinatown' ... i know that's way too over simplistic and kinda-sorta a 'pop b.s.' way to look at it, but... ...watch how it plays out over the next 5-15 years, let alone 25-50 years. Chinatown was released in '74, but set in '37... so, ~40 years between the two.. and, well, from the release date, ~ another 40 years... ....so, just noting the development that happened from the 'mid-30's' to the 'mid-'70s'   ... and then the 'mid-70s' to today... ... divides the time down into two 'pretty clean chunks'.  in '40 years time', I imagine California will look... much like the last 40 years of 'progress' has looked like.   ...desal plants probably playing a huge part of that.  ...esp with [materials](/r/materials) like [graphene](/r/graphene) starting to become available and providing 'perfect' [water filtration](http://www.manchester.ac.uk/discover/news/article/?id=11561).    "let's turn a desert into a verdant tropic" mentality.  brilliant plant that's working out for them great thus far! :)   original paper: [Broadband magnetometry and temperature sensing with a light-trapping diamond waveguide](http://www.nature.com/nphys/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nphys3291.html)   I think it will get to the point where they quite simply won't be able to afford not to.  meaning, their cost for doing business will be so high vs the competition that they simply won't be able to afford to do business any more.  Sure the state can do bailouts, grants, etc to make it more cost-effective   profitable for the business owners, but even *that* will weigh down the state to the point that, at some point, people start revolting... and in such a way that even that breaks down  ...and, usually at the expense of the citizens (unfortunately).  I mean, how many people in california would be effected if, say, Nestle shuts its doors to that bottling facility?  and, not just the direct jobs themselves, but the ancillary ones... insurance agents, servers/waiters, bar tenders, mechanics, etc.   and with legalization around the corner, even drug dealers woudl have a hard time staying in business.  I'm not arguing to keep nestle open, i'm saying that the entire practice is unaffordable, unsustainable, and breaking down.  desal can certainly provide the raw materials (solar, waves, wind, geothermal, etc can provide the energy needed for heat... desalination, reverse osmosis, etc... )  but at what cost? and, more so... why do that that way only to continue to waste it due to inefficiency on the back end?  25%+ of the water that goes to the ag industry in california is lost due to irrigative evaporation.   promote various methods that change irrigation practices, punish those who don't, and right off the bat there'll be more savings to justify *not* building so many desal plants.  california doesn't 'need' desal. it needs a change in infrastructural   managerial approach   ...or they could just add [biochar](/r/biochar) to their [soils](/r/soil), change their [agricultural](/r/agriculture) practices to actually *build* soil and *retain* [water](/r/water), vs wasting it on inefficient and high-loss [irrigation](/r/Irrigation) or bottling it up and exporting it via nestle and other.  with that, they could also tie the ['waste'](/r/waste) heat from their power plants into a [wastewater](/r/wastewater) distillation process that allows for it to be near-perpetually recycled back into the market for reuse.   California's biggest problem is that they run an ag industry that their environment can't support, in a way that is horribly inefficient and makes it all the *less* sustainable... while horridly underutilizing their infrastructure to properly balance their demands.  but, still neat math. ...and, honestly, seems totally doable.     breed the gluten out of wheat  'breeding' it out is one thing.  like, if they 'gmo'd' one to use as a base to know what genes they'd need to exist... and not... and then did controlled 'breeding' of natural strains along the lines necessary to attain that geneset? fine. great even.  but, well, to insert genes into it... and then to plant those far   wide.. is just taking the whole GMO thing one step farther, and one step more-clouded in 'this is a good idea' stupidity.  my follow up to that (wrote that after reading your first paragraph... before reading your second).... was going to be, 'ultimately, 'who cares?' ... when you can just get gluten-free now?  better efforts would seemingly be spent on widening the availability of products on the market that are al*ready* gluten free.... they're out there, but they pale in comparison to the gluten-'rich' products out there.  but, i like science? so... kudos for *that*?   x-post: /r/transhumanism   x-post: /r/neurobiology     original paper: [Computing with carbon nanotubes: Optimization of threshold logic gates using disordered nanotube/polymer composites](http://scitation.aip.org/content/aip/journal/jap/117/13/10.1063/1.4915343)   I know this is graphite not graphene, but it's still really neat!  	199

If you have a combined universe you're going to want to save the best characters for the movies and the TV universe becomes a second class operation with the left over characters.

There are people who make a lot of money selling these things. And, in all fairness, the lessons I learned going into people's houses and pitching a $900 vacuum cleaner two or three times a day for those six weeks have served me well in my various jobs since then.   Can't say that I was too excited about this. By the end, the show had become a sad parody of itself, but it is nice to see the guys back together.   Why are you concerned about what's legal or not? Why would anyone take a job like that? Why would you work for a company that would offer a job like that? It's insane.  Figuring a three hundred mile distance (five hours at 60MPH) between both cities, you'd be spending over a $100 a week in gas alone, assuming you have a decent car and gas prices don't go back up. You'd put over 75k miles on your car in the span of a year.  Seems to me that somebody at this company is trying to cheap out, hiring one engineer to fill in at both locations instead of hiring one for each.        Yeah, I'm pretty sure that modifying your hourly pay on a week-to-week basis based on how many hours you work so that your weekly pay remains the same is not in any way legal.    Song Of The Sea. Every scene is a moving piece of art.   RIP Robin. Thanks for everything.   Hope you're enjoying the next part of the journey.   I just don't get people who get all wound up over remakes.   It's not like they're recording over the original film The old one is still there. You can watch it whenever you like.      They will if we give it enough upvotes.   What's the point of solar in space?  I get that you can get power 24/7 instead of worrying about day/night cycles and weather here on Earth plus you get better efficiency , but isn't  going to be cheaper to just build more solar panels and some kind of energy storage here on the ground than launch a huge solar power station out of the gravity well and then maintain it in orbit?   I recently binged the entire series and I think it holds up pretty well.  There's a lot of meh in seasons 1 and 2, but I think you can say that about any of the Star Trek series. Once you get to season 3 things are really clicking and season 4 was very enjoyable.  I bailed out the first time around after season 2. In retrospect, I should have kept with it.  The finale was terrible, though.    Nicely done.   Yes, some eBay sellers have helpfully posted the MEIDs on their listings. None I've checked have passed the check.  I wonder if we should see about filing a formal complaint with the FCC. Sprint's actions certainly violate the spirit of the new CTIA Consumer Code.   Stormy Monday   Before the the whole FEC thing came down, my plan was to pick up a used LG G2 on eBay, once that model became available for transfer, and retire my old Galaxy S2, which has given me good service, but is getting a bit long in the tooth.  Then I figured I'd wait a bit after the new year, figuring there would be a lot of used phones for sale after people got their new shiny for X-Mas. Well, that was a mistake.  So, what to do now? Is there some resolution for this in the pipeline? As far as I can tell, my only decent option now is to wait or buy a new device from Ting.    I really don't want to switch to GSM. My workplace has Sprint repeaters and I get excellent service.   I have a fairly modern tablet (Sony Xperia Z) and a big town (level 50) and the Tapped Out app crashes several times a day. Some times I can't even restart it unless I force stop it and clear the cache.  It's pretty annoying. Anyone else have similar issues?   Carpe Diem   Song Of The Sea.   What a lush and beautiful film. Every scene in the movie was like a painting and the story was sad and haunting. A little too sad for my six year-old, who likes her films to be more upbeat.   I saw it today at the Cinema Arts Centre in Huntington and the place was sold out. Makes me wonder why it didn't get a wider release.   I think I actually used to know that. Gotta love the Golden Age.   Pretty sure you mean heavy water, mister bot. Heavy water is  a form of water that contains a larger than normal amount of the radioactive hydrogen isotope deuterium.  Hard water just has a lot of minerals in it.   Nothing wrong with that. It's kinda how watching Justified is like watching Deadwood.    I laughed at this, but I felt bad about it.   I would so watch this.      I love the old-timey football pics, not to mention the fact that the NFL invented Arena Football in 1932,   Casino gambling almost never brings anywhere near the promised benefits. AC has had gambling for decades and it hasn't had much of a positive impact.      The event runs until at least 3/24. I assume they don't want people to get all the items right away and then get bored with it.   In science it often happens that scientists say, 'You know that's a really good argument; my position is mistaken,' and then they would actually change their minds and you never hear that old view from them again. They really do it. It doesn't happen as often as it should, because scientists are human and change is sometimes painful. But it happens every day. I cannot recall the last time something like that happened in politics or religion.    --Carl Sagan   My id is test_subject96, same as my Reddit ID.  I'm level 49, have a lot of cool stuff and play multiple time a day.   I watch it with my six year-old daughter. The days following a new episode are filled with GF rewatching on a constant loop until my wife gets sick of it.   And Orphan Black.   I may as well tell my boss I won't be coming in to work in April as I'll be on a TV holiday.   Looks to me like your boss was looking for an excuse to fire you because you were on FMLA. I'd speak with an employment lawyer ASAP.   After watching that, I typed Naked Ladies into Google, just out of curiosity. First result is three year old post on imgur linked from reddit.   The Last Starfighter  Flash Gordon (1980)  If you want to expand his horizons a bit, try Forbidden Planet   Unless you signed something preventing it, you are free to speak about the work you did, especially in private during an interview.  Verbal directives from the partners mean nothing.         I loved it when it was on, but back in the 80's there was a real shortage of SF/Fantasy/Genre shows so we  tended to latch on to whatever they deigned to show us. I loved the 80's Buck Rogers show, which has little to recommend it these days except Erin Gray in skin-tight spandex outfits.  GAH is a show very much of its time. It has problems common to superhero shows of that period including a lack of super villains and terrible VFX.  I'd give it a few episodes if you're interested.     Someone needs to explain to me why these parents aren't in prison for child abuse.   I could see them doing a Greatest American Hero deal to keep his power in check. He gets the ring, but has no idea how to use it.   As high as necessary to make the job worthwhile for you.  The only thing I'd say is not to get ahead of yourself. You don't know what their offer will be or even if you'll get one. Wait until you have the  numbers, then decide.   Which is why he covered his face when he saw the network closet was under video surveillance. And why he ran from security when they came to speak with him.    Well said. I'm going to copy and save this so I can paste it in whenever this topic comes up.   MIT reportedly wanted him to serve some jail time as deterrent to someone else abusing their open computer resources to make a political point.   If he thought what he was doing was legal, then he should have gone to court and argued the point.  It's clear that he knew what he was doing was illegal because, instead of downloading the JSTOR files from his desk at Harvard, he went to MIT and abused their open computer resources to make his political point.   In the process, he created no end of headaches for the network admins at MIT as well as students, faculty and researchers who had their access to JSTOR curtailed while Swartz evaded their attempts to kick him off their network.    Line cook is not a position that's eligible for exempt (salary with no OT paid) pay.    http://www.dol.gov/elaws/esa/flsa/screen75.asp  What was your weekly paycheck?   I think they ran out of money. They did most/all of the interviews, but they don't have money/time to finish it up.  The blu rays for sale on their site are pre-orders, just FYI.   You handle it like you'd handle any other job where you had a falling out with your boss. Be honest about having difficulties with your supervisor without getting too specific about the gory details. Explain that, due to your interpersonal issues, you don't expect to get a good reference from them.   If you can, you find someone, a co-worker or client, that you worked with who can give you an alternate reference for that job.  Since it was a family business, you can calmly explain without getting into to much detail, that you had a falling out with with your parent in part because you make a clean break and strike out on your own.  Best of luck to you.   That's neat. I didn't realize that Gotham and Rome shared the same creator. Gotham certainly has its issues, but I'm enjoying it overall and given how great Rome was, it gives me some hope for the future of Gotham.  Interestingly enough, I saw the parallels between Gotham's Bruce Wayne and Rome's Octavian right from the beginning. Gotham may run into the same issue that Rome did if they decide to time jump and replace David Mazouz.     Seems like a good lineup, although I'm not a big fan of any iteration of Hawk and Dove.  Disappointing not to see Cyborg and Beast Boy in the lineup, but making either of those characters look halfway decent on a TNT budget is probably nigh impossible.  Not that this was ever going to happen anyway, but I guess that ends any possibility of another Birds of Prey TV show.    What did your boss say when you told him how much the recruiter was taking?   If I were you, I'd go back to the recruiter and tell them you want a 30% bump effective immediately or you're going to start looking for new work and you're going to tell the client exactly why. I doubt they want to queer the relationship with such a valuable client.  	84
 Also try not to just row one side.       So far we've done two 30' tests and I did worse on the second one, which is why this whole debate started. Since then I've been training with higher splits to keep my heart rate in the right zone (until the end of a piece every now and then). We have our next test tomorrow, so hopefully this will all pay off and I'll be okay.  And I don't feel like I'm killing myself at 170+ but I also don't feel like I know enough about hr zones to say that I'm okay there, because it is tiring but not that tiring. I've only been rowing for 2+ years and I've only been paying attention to my hr for the past six months. I will definitely discuss more with my coaches. Thank you so much!   We use our split from a 30' test +7 for SS. Most people on my team seem to be keeping their hr between 160-165 but mine is 170+. So I've been doing SS at 30'T +9 or 10. It sucks for team SS workouts because people with slower 2ks than me are finishing distance pieces minutes before me. Sometimes I get too competitive and end up pulling too hard and getting my hr above the target zone. My coaches scold me for this because they like lower hrs for SS. But I'm glad you guys are saying it isn't terrible for my hr to be a little higher because my coaches made it seem like a Very Bad Thing.   	4
 Check the education data layer to see where the uneducated (ie. the purple "kids") are in your city, might indicate a traffic problem.  Like heterodoxz says, close down the other schools and leave only the university so it can be upgraded and you can build more school add-ons.  I've done the university only thing for an extended period of time, but it's a drag on traffic especially if you've only got one uni serving the whole city (but two or more unis take up so much room, especially with all the upgrades). Having a high school (or two, placed strategically), and a university in a good location traffic wise works better for me (note this wasn't for an education city, just your typical electronics one).  I find that it's best not to have too many extra desks, as that might invite out of town students, unless that's what you want. Out of town students can clog up your city entrances and routes to the schools in the morning, and might even force your own city's students to miss out on an education in the process.   Produce alloy with the recycling center and sell it to the global market at the trade port/depot, very easy way to make a lot of money quickly.  Alternatively, you can create a new city in the region whose sole purpose is to pick up trash for your main city, once you gift the new city some cash at the start. It saves you from having to waste precious room building garbage/recycling centers in your main city.   "All this has happened before. All this will happen again."  http://en.memory-alpha.org/wiki/File:USS_Enterprise-D_convention_near_a_quantum_fissure.jpg  On the positive side, one of those trucks will have come from a dimension where the traffic agent actually works.   Probably just temporary server problems, if it is indeed the right server (saves are localized to each server).  Others were having this problem prior to 2.0, I think you just had to do the tutorial, and then your cities will be there again.   Heh, thanks!  As for the llama problem, perhaps a llama map layer might help to identify the source of all these llama infestations.  	5

 Wait til Wrestlemania   I'd pay to see him in this gimmick vs Zayn   1 - Board with PLX chip  2 - X99 chipset with a processor that supports 40 lanes   I doubt it. Even if in theory it would work, AMD and NVIDIA might disable it in their driver settings.    Jokes on them. I haven't even finished GTA II, III and IV   I honestly think it was actually a segment meant to get Reigns over, but Heyman, being Heyman, well maybe he feels that he would give his 2 cents, in a non direct kind of way  I do honestly feel he was being sarcastic. When he went to the ring, he looks visibly scared of DBry, but he was not so of Reigns. Why would you be scared of a guy that had lost to the person that you're going to meet?       is it just me or Heyman is actually burying Reigns now?   I really was neutral about this match, until I realised that *Gasp* It will be Brock vs Goldberg at WM XX all over again.

The only thing they told their customer teams were not to use a higher engine power mapping (than what the works team are using) if they are in fight with the works team. It was in one of Ted's feature in Bahrain when they were talking to Smedley.   Officially it's to stop both team to one up each other in term of the engine power in a race, which could lead both engine to retire prematurely (the ICE need to last 4 races)   FI also uses Mercedes gearbox. Hence they had the same gear ratio with Mercedes throughout the year (the long 7th gear that did not go into 8th unlike all the other teams)   It started in the 90s I think, when a driver has to nominate which tyres they would use in the race. The tyre manufacturer will bring two compounds, a prime (which would be the safe tyre) or the option (a softer tyre that would be faster but won't last as long).   Once you made the decision, you will be stuck with it for the whole of the race. As you can see at this moment in history, there is no reason for tyre mismatch, as you're stuck with one compound of tyres!  The Option + Prime combo usage was decided by Bernie to spice up racing, as seen from it's highly effective use in America's CART series. A lot of people have asked if they can mix and match the tyre compound, as every year you would hear Martin Brundle mention it at least twice. But the FIA had shot down the idea quickly as it would be "confusing to the viewers".  Note that not only you can't mix the tyre compounds, but you also can't switch which tyre side. For example you can't switch a left front tyre to a front right tyre. Juan Pablo Montoya's McLaren had it's front tyre mistakenly switch around, and in the race he complained that the car felt like it had a puncture.       http://nlab.itmedia.co.jp/nl/articles/1502/10/news059.html  Source, in Japanese      Need more Doritos flavoured Mountain dew   Is it just me, or the VodkaO Mercedes that went in the wall just now is using the Petronas Syntium livery, but without any Petronas brandings?  https://www.google.com.my/search?q=petronas+syntium+mercedes+sls+GT3 espv=2 biw=1600 bih=732 source=lnms tbm=isch sa=X ei=pdLWVIT2DcugugSHxYJA ved=0CAYQ_AUoAQ   The worst thing is that when you unscrew it, it will actually unscrew the metal connector that it's screwed into, instead of just the vga head.

But unless your OS is optimised for it (read: Linux server for multithreading) it's worthless   Depends on the chipset. Only LGA2011's X79 and X99 chipset supports for quad channel RAM, hence the 8 RAM slots. You won't usually see normal consumer use this, as these are targeted for really hardcore gamers/overclockers, and cost a bomb  If you're sticking to the Intel Z97/Z87 based boards, you won't get more than 4 RAM slots as the processor only supports dual channel RAM   No, but if you're an overclocker, those extra capacitors and MOSFETS on the larger board leads to better and much more stable overclocking.

I think there are high cuts for Superlight tho  http://i.imgur.com/pHSsnRl.jpg  Some of my Puma shoes. My drift cats are in the car since it's for driving only. The high cut ones are Kart Racing, the red and black is Ferrari Superlight and the white is casual Mini. I also have an all black Mercedes that I wear for meeting   The advantage in Abu Dhabi was not only due to the car alone, but because Perez has really old tyres compared to both Hamilton and Rosberg   http://blog.naver.com/obsidian24   I have two pairs of drift cats. The best driving shoes I have         WTF Malaysia supposed to represent?      Wat                     Not really.

After that uplay keeps frustrating me and I never bought another game from Ubisoft again  It''s different from Origin. EA actually made it better (my only bad experience was when my account was hacked, but I got my games back using their oh so slow customer support). Uplay does not seem to fix their issues as fast as Origin or Steam has   once every four years vs 20 every year.  You can't really compare   matt le blanc was there. And he's a big F1 fan   Really old engine?   Monza configuration?   The show does not take itself seriously. It parodies every cliche and trope of super sentai and kamen rider and anime, which makes it a good watch      something about NTSC vs PAL      I actually prefer 25FPS if it's a movie or video due to easier encoding. Hence most of my games are recorded at that rate. But playing the games itself, nothing beats high FPS.       http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tADubIxFuv8 feature=youtu.be  Tested with my game. It actually IS 60FPS and is goddamn smooth. Thank you jewtube   By the end of the day most of the guys that uses SteamOS turned back to Windows so I expect teh dual boot feature won't be important after 2 to 3 weeks   depends. Post processing are just that. Addon filters that are added to give fake effects. It's not even realistic and just there to make it look cool and stuffs. Hence why there is an option to turn it off.    Ever been playing in a competitive online racing game? You want all the advantages you can get. Who cares about realism   I was watching the race. It's good for tin top. But for open wheels? Dangerous   That's why I turn off post processing   Site owner here. He's not me  	139
 "Well, shit..."   Clownfish can change their gender   Cat.   I've done that and I'm still waiting for a service like this to exist   "I already donate" "No thank you" "I already own it"   Last night:  "You look really beautiful right now.... For some reason" *confused face*  Said by my drunk coworker who is a "secret softie" hardass chick   I'm an American and I eat all of those things!    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gblxAoWKsmE   Aww, this made me tear up. I miss my Nana :')   Brilliant. This one is my favorite.   Fantastic! Thanks so much for giving me 3 options for them, that's exactly what I needed :)   Bullet is a solid rye, even if r/whiskey has differing opinions, you can't "disagree" with someone's palate. This is helpful for that reason especially!   This is in Boston. Everything is expensive and nothing makes sense.    This is in Boston. Everything is expensive here :/   Awesome, thank you! High west campfire is great. Rye is my favorite of the spirits so this is really awesome advice, thanks!   Thanks a bunch! This is good information :)   Haha this is a fantastic response. You hit the nail on the head with your assessment. I always prefer rye for my manhattans and scotch to sip. I'll have to think of a few more options because I'm not fond of very "sweet" whiskeys so I appreciate the direction to focus on :D   Thank you so much! This is incredibly helpful! I've tried quite a few, but honestly ony can remember about one or two from most categories as I wasn't drinking them with the intention of selling it, heh. I really appreciate the feedback and will keep it in mind until I have my own go-to's as ammunition :)   Hey all!  I just got a new job as a cocktail waitress at a bar specializing in whiskey/whisky... A lot of patrons will ask for suggestions on recommendations for a good bourbon/scotch/rye of varying conditions/batches/etc.  I was curious what r/whiskey thought about some solid go-to's and why.  [Here is the full spirits list for anyone curious.](http://www.saloondavis.com/documents/Saloon_Bourbon8.9.13.pdf) It changes often, so anything outside of this is encouraged, too, but try to stick to the list if you can :)  Thanks!   A lot of people seem to think they're crows, but they are actually starlings! The collective noun for starlings is called a murmuration. [Check out this really awesome video of them in a flock!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRNqhi2ka9k)   A murmuration of starlings, actually! :)   murmuration, actually! Those are starlings :)   Those are starlings, so it would be a murmuration :D   Adobe Flash and the CS5 suite. I like flash for sketching because it is smooth and I can save the drawings in various sizes :)   Awesome! My aunt who lives in Australia gave it to me as a kid. I loved that book!   [I kind of already did that, as a cheeta clam king!](http://i.imgur.com/caa4rjf.png)   Thank you so much! That is incredibly helpful!   My pleasure! :D   OH GOD if it wasn't an insect I would. Meep! Any other animal besides an insect? Snakes/rodents/sea creatures are fair game but insects freak me out! :   [Herpa Derp. He needs to lay off the fried chicken and cotton candy!](http://i.imgur.com/6VFEsZZ.png)   [Here's a quickie!](http://i.imgur.com/hZxnKYI.png)  Edit: Fixed it up!   [Here you go! That was fun!](http://i.imgur.com/vskGW4o.png)   Digital sketches for your viewing pleasure. [Here is an example of my art.](http://imgur.com/JTkhM6m)  **Update:** hey all, gonna take a little break for a bit but I promise I'll come back and work on some more art :)   Thank you!  Your username reminds me of an old children's book I used to have called "All Right Vegemite!" :)   came here to say this. It's too perfect!   Just made a ton of flash cards and have been taking notes and making sure I'm pronouncing things right (like Cynar for example).   As far as customer service goes, I have that in the bag and I know I'll kill it in that department; I just need to make sure I don't fuck up my drinks!  I am going into the bar before they open today to do a little practice. I'll report back after. Thanks a bunch!   Awesome advice, thank you!!!   The bar is more upscale than that, which is why I'm intimidated...  http://www.saloondavis.com   Thank you! This is a great help!  Also, how do bartenders usually memorize so many drinks? Do you normally study it when first starting out or did a lot of it come with practice?    Great job!   This comes off more creepy and stalkerish than awesome. I feel bad for celebrities sometimes. Cool photo either way, OP. Workaholics is great... Maybe next time take a mental picture when you're in a situation like that?   So, I just started a new job as a hostess at a local restaurant and not even a week in I was asked if I would be interested in cocktail waitressing. I have server experience and a really great analytical memory, so I enthusiastically agreed... Cut to yesterday, I show up for my shift and was pulled aside from the (lead?) bartender and asked if I was interested in bartending. I was honest about my lack of experience which he seemed fine with (he said he prefers training new bartenders over acclimating existing bartenders with attitudes). I am heading in on Sunday to do a little training and I'm extremely nervous. I've been in myriad positions where I've had to learn on the fly, and the staff seems to really like me here but I can't help but feel like they're insane for asking me two weeks into my new job.       Any help or advice on how to kick ass and learn fast would be appreciated, along with any useful tips that any new bartender should know. There's a possibility this is just a trial run and won't end up with an actual bar position, but I want to be prepared for all possible outcomes.        **TL;DR:** I was asked if I wanted to be a bartender with no previous bartending experience because my managers think I am organized and a fast learner (I presume). Please help with tips/opinions in any way!       Thanks for reading :)   Seriously, you have helped me get through SO many shitty days at my horrible job. I put a post-it on my desk that says "You didn't get mauled by a bear. You can get through this day!!!"  As much as that sounds like a back handed compliment, I read your whole thread and your attitude and just overall sense of fight has seriously been such an incredible inspiration. Thanks for coming back to check in!!! :D   Gotta love their michelada's, too!   I think it used to be Deep Ellum, but it has changed... It's still good, but not the best. Redbones has a damn fine Bloody as well as The Haven.... I need to try Eastcoast Grill, that sounds glorious.  Also, I make a mean bloody and it's really quite easy! You should try making your own!   I lived in Miami for a little while... You aren't going to come even close to Miami Cuban... You're better off not even trying. El Oriental de Cuba is great, but it's a far cry from Miami Cuban....    Seriously, I'm so thankful I'm not that frump anymore... Still have body dysmorphic disorder from being picked on so much but I guess that makes me humble???   Thank you :)   Who? Which girl? I guess I could google search but...   Christ, I thought I was SO COOL with that thing. Ugh, haha. Pretty sure I got it as Macy's. So punxxxxx    Sweet! Give her a high five for me! We are a strange mix! :)   Haha no offense taken. I was greasy and awkward... It was also taken in a shitty mall photo booth with my best friend at the time... It had a banner that said **ANGEL'S** or something pathetic like that, too. I'd probably be offended if I still looked like that, haha...   My father is Yemenite Israeli, my mother is a second generation Irish American.   My really pretty fucking ugly what?   Haha, thanks for the vote of confidence, Leigh!   Heh. I do what I can... :3  	56
 No, it isn't. The paint almost always crack and look terrible. Buy some [Angelus Shoe Paint] (http://angelusdirect.com/collections/paint) if you want to paint your shoes.   Dooope   I mean I vote for the Toro Bravos, but that's just me.   A personal favourite of mine is [GreatsBrand] (https://www.greats.com/).   Amen.   Dude, just rock what you like. It shouldn't really matter of what others think. Wear what you like.   HesKicks made these and called them the Kyrie 1 iD "Mag", after the Air Mag. Then, when All-Stars came around and the All-Star colourways were being released, they released something [very similar] (http://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NTI5WDk0MA==/z/7j8AAOSweW5U31tN/$_35.JPG) to these.   [Ikea] (http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/60037538/#)   Not to big on the SL Loop Moc's, but it's a dope shot either way fam.   *upvotes furiously*   I currently have to watch CNN Student News every other day, and take notes on it. I know this is a subreddit literally titled "CNNsucks", but I just want to know your thoughts on this.   Where I live Publix is a good place to find a job.   Some [Vans Authentic] (http://www.vans.com/shop/canvas-authentic-black) would probably be good. They're only around $50 and come in just about every fucking color in the rainbow.  Or [Converse] (http://www.converse.com/regular/chuck-taylor-classic-colors/MP_51.html), cause you can never go wrong with some Chucks.   Not too big a fan of the NB logo on the tongue, but they dope.   I personally don't see the appeal in Visvim.      In my opinion, no. But, wear what you like man.   It's *Donnie's* shit, btw.   First heard about this theory [here] (http://www.djbooth.net/index/news/entry/2015-04-06-chance-the-rapper-new-album).  I mean it makes a good bit of sense I guess but I don't think that much logic is behind it.   I think Donnie said it in an [interview] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EfNVDoX3e1g) on some radio show in LA with Chance  Edit: Power 106 is in New York, not LA. I apologize.   This has to do with the switch from the Julian calender to the Gregorian calender. January and Fabuary I think weren't in the Julian and then inserted into the Gregorian, thus pushing October two months ahead.  Edit: I am wrong.   Probably brains more suited to handle Math and Statistics.   God, not dog.     	24
 Try Laphroaig - the smokiness is so delicious.   Yes - if the papers that will ultimately become your chapters are already complete.   Some faculty are a bit unprofessional like that. Do you work with some professor, or have a mentor faculty? Tell them to talk to her. And yes, four months delay is unacceptable.   The author - a professor at BU's business school surveyed 100 employees of a management consulting firm. She found that the first group, which worked 80 hours weekly were highly praised and got the best promotions. The second group, who were vocal about maintaining a work-life balance were in fact punished come promotion time, and got negative reviews. What's interesting is the third group, who worked much lesser hours, but bluffed about their working hours to keep up the illusion of a 80 hour workweek faced no repercussions at all. In fact, they were as highly praised and as often promoted as the first group, even though they worked far lesser hours.   Corollary: What are everyone's opinions about the [online MS in Computer Science from Georgia Tech](http://www.omscs.gatech.edu/)?   Same here. Courses reward conscientiousness, not knowledge or understanding. Even most grad courses do that too. As somewhat who is perpetually chasing deadlines, and is overworked the conscientiousness I have to spare for courses is way too limited.   Coincidence: I discovered (*torrented*) this series in 2013, and watched it all at one go in December 22, 2013. I know that date so well because as soon as I finished part 1, I was so impressed by one man that I had to Google him: [Victor Sarianidi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viktor_Sarianidi).  Imagine my shock when I find out that Sarianidi passed away that day, just a few hours back.  Even more amazing was the absolute uncorruptibility of Sarianidi, who first discovered and later the Afghan museum curators who later protected with their own life the [Bactrian gold.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tillya_Tepe)   Every single interaction I had with someone from Pakistan IRL has been overwhelmingly positive. While I was in Boston, there used to a Pakistani-owned pizza place a block from my house which was my thek every evening. Online is however a completely different story however. defence.pk fluctuates between being great and being terrible (it right now is in the terrible phase). However, in my experience a lot of it has to do with moderation. Horus, for example, over at defence.pk is the administrator, and is the primary reason for the mess over there.   Actually not that much - and every country tries this subtle racism. American tourists are also well known boors in Thailand, Mexico and South America.  I have been to Mexico during what was a lean season, and while sipping some beers with the owner of a mostly empty restaurant heard that he hated American spring breakers with a passion. They will trash the place consistently every year. Similarly Chinese tourists are often ridiculed in USA. A As I said, it is a subtle form of racism - and we Indians should learn to recognize it.      I recently found out that over the last year, the most texts I have exchanged with anybody was my adviser. What was scary is how far she was ahead of anybody else.   True story - for an essay I recently wrote I took five hours to write it down, and seven hours to make it pretty in LaTex.  Even though, I can now proudly say that I have learned how to make wrapfig and equations play nice with each other.   Even in the 21st century we still have to ask about acknowledging significant others? Come on, we are grad student - not grad androids.   Maybe - and while it may sound racist to paint Asians as such, I have some rejoinders - American academia is often very different from Asian academia, and adjustment can often be difficult. Two - most Asian kids in top US schools come from much more competitive schools back home. Someone who comes in from Tsinghua or IIT had to be really work hard to come to USA - and so their outlook and attitudes are often much different.  And three, in my limited observations, most students open up and interact better through the years (though some don't, and those who don't uniformly are from a very monoculture group where the PI, postdocs and the PhD students are all from the country, and sometimes even the same university).  Ultimately does this matter? I will argue it does - a lot. Grad school is inherently lonely and often frustrating. You do not succeed alone though - and a great department atmosphere actually helps. The same reason that it is imperative for our schools and workplaces to be more diverse, is the same reason grad schools, and even research groups should try to be more diverse. I am an Asian international student myself - and I am not trying to be racist here - but trying to argue for a more diverse, collaborative and inclusive research experience.   If you have a lot of time - try learning Beamer. Beamer's native presentation styles are hideous - but because of the flexibility, one day you may go ahead and create the [the most beautiful presentation I have ever seen](http://pyprop.googlecode.com/files/disputas.pdf)  	15
 Hi there,  Sounds like you're definitely experiencing some anxiety in your situation, perhaps a bit of depression aswell. I'm not a professional though so don't take my word on that.  It sounds like you're going through a really difficult situation right now and I'm not surprised that you're having these feelings - in fact it's probably quite a normal response. The problem seems to be that these feelings of anxiety aren't serving their purpose of motivating you, and have got so severe that they're having a negative impact on your life.  I imagine you haven't had any previous input from professionals as you mention that you've not felt like this before, but there are plenty of techniques you can use to help combat these feelings ranging from the professional route to the self-help route.  Perhaps the first thing you should consider is meditation, you'll be amazed at how quickly this can make you feel physically calmer (within minutes!) and there are loads of online guides that will help you get started. It's very difficult at first but it will at least be a first step of making you aware of how busy your mind is and hopefully help you identify the negative thoughts that are making you feel this way.  I hope this is a helpful starting point and please message me if I can help in any way!   I find they're really helpful. All of the unpleasant feelings that you have at the moment are based on what is going to happen in the future. If you practice meditation or mindfulness you can start to focus yourself to be in the moment, and speaking from experience this is a huge release. It helps you release that at any moment you can get away for these horrible feelings if you need to.  Do you have a smart phone? There's an app I could recommend, if not I can have a quick look for some online sources   Okay well that's a good start. TV is great at taking you out of the moment and helping you focus on other things. Have you considered trying meditation or mindfulness at all?   Being a person is the hardest thing you'll ever do, I've been in some pretty dark places, but it's also the best thing.  First things first, have you tried any coping mechanisms already?   I know that feeling, it's nice to stay in a comfortable, safe place after experiencing anxiety for a while. I think that doing this will only serve to increase your anxiety in the long run though.   You've got to keep pushing yourself to leave that comfort zone and you'll get back to normal soon enough. Try and force yourself to go to the gym today, PM me when you've done it to keep yourself accountable :)  You're not alone with these feelings and they're definitely possible to overcome!   I don't know about dangerous mental illnesses, but I know that a lot of Psychology students suffer from mental health problems. Who's best motivated to raise awareness and treat people with mental illness? The one's who suffer from it.  Source: I am a Psychology Masters student     Looks more like two hippocampi.

To anyone about to watch this, don't be put off by the title and watch it all the way through.   I have a horrible feeling this is a cropped scene from The Walking Dead.   Brothers, sisters, thank you for showing me the whey   Although I am but a few steps down the iron path, it has been well trodden by those who have worshipped before me. I have seen that whilst the path is treacherous, all those that walk it with devotion in their hearts are rewarded.  Today I gazed into the mirror and with great joy saw my first blessing - I beheld not a boy, but a man!  Now all that remains is to visit my temple and give thanks.   Let them lift weight - Brodin willed it, and it was done.   Alas, you have paid the price for being tempted by Broki. But fear not, although the path may now be somewhat longer, it is laid out before you still.  One step at a time brother. Make us proud.   Couldn't agree more, everybody is more worried about how they look themselves!   Hmm, kinda funny looking.   I'd probably grab a fistful of poop from the toilet and fling it at them, if that doesn't work I don't know what will!  	16
