 And here I was telling everyone how great Kelly is and how everybody should love him and how the Celtics totally aren't gonna blow it.....they blew it   for some reason Smart has flopped a couple times since he's started playing, which is surprising to me   god awful. take a lap      Definitely take a sticker over here!

 Good point!  I guess I did feel a little better admitting to someone that something was wrong.  As hard as that was, I am extremely stubborn, but I still hit my breaking point.    Hahahahahahaha... and not the "haha" that people type without laughing, no I literally laughed out loud at that.  I'm not sure why, maybe because I took French for many years, and don't remember a thing.  	2
 Hey ladies   That I7 Dominant to another key?   Yeeessssss!    This made me laugh aloud in public.    Brad.   David Bowie.   ^ Vegan. Can confirm.   I'm sorry, dude. :( That's never a good thing to hear. I hope you get to spend as much time as you can with her.  	8
 Crafts like bracelets.   What kind of camp are you going to? I'm old and don't know of any camps but I still want to go!   I've done that multiple times for school and work. If you get enough caffeine you'll get the over tired energy and be wide awake until you suddenly CRASH which is hopefully after the shift. Which hotel do you work at? (If it's a chain)   If you had the dope now you have wouldn't have to worry about shitting.   I'm fucked up so now I'm apathetic and act like an asshole.   For $600 in Cali, you'll live in a shitty area/apartment. Find a roommate, either someone near a college, via craigslist, through subreddits. You're better off renting a room for $400ish with a few roommates.   Yes and it always gets it right. Knows me so well. We're good friends.   Idk where you live. Get a sub and fries. Or Chinese   Me neither. Fuck shit, bang bang.   Asus   Marketing   That's what I'm saying. No one should pay for them. As far as myself, lots of food and condiments, coffee, mugs, shampoo, conditioner, lotion, towels.   Do you work in accounting?    Ketchup, salt, pepper.   Most recently, inside out.   Seems more of what he should be drawing than may actually be drawing. But hilarious and awesome, nonetheless.   Buffalo NY, 716. Hello!   Cheese and mushroom. But not too hot. Room temp.   Same.   What programs can help? I'm in the same boat as OP. this would help tremendously.   How fast can you make a pizza? What is the cost per pizza to make?   1926   Yup. Sounds like it. She's probably just used to fucking and not having much relationship type sex. She'll probably love it though. You'll have to teach her!   I have a few ideas that kind of make sense. One that is more nonprofit, the other is more art therapy. Ughhhhhh. anxiety.   I'm a bad planner and lack motivation and support. I have too many ideas and don't know how to center them. I think a large part of it is my depression. At this point, I'm just happy to be able to get out of bed and go to work in the morning. I don't even know where to begin and everything I read on /r/smallbusiness and /r/entrepreneur is overwhelming. Oh, and I don't know how to promote it.   either some kind of arts/craft/decor business or a nonprofit or organization for kids down the wrong path. Mixing both together would be ideal.   up!   I have the same degree, graduated in May. I've gotten offered sales and marketing jobs but fuck the man. I have business and refuse to contribute to the overwhelming consumerism. I don't care at this point. I'm secure at home for now and will wait until I find a good job. I don't overly care/worry about work, I care about life.  Oh, and I remember reading an article that was on the top 10 companies that hire new college grads. Google that! You're going to have to pay your dues if you want to work in HR, I think.   Only read the tl;dr. I think you're 100% normal and have the vegabond bug! You have to take action. Do what you love, continue exploring. This is who you are! Not stuck in an office, not stuck with these people that are doing nothing and are so closed off from the rest of the world, content with staying still. Own it, do it. You are who you are. This could be a career, this could be your life.     i wish   paris   Do it you pussy! (your words not mine)  Ever seen that one Shia Lebeuf film (can't remember the name). He draws a small picture of the girl, then when she walks by, he says "hey did you drop this?" and it has his number on it as well. I think it's cute. I'm a female.   I've only seen 37 of these. Don't tell anyone.   I need to see this ASAP!   Get in touch with the 2 murderers that escaped from prison in NY. they know how to do it.   Heroin actually is sometimes cut with ground cocoa puffs and similar cereals.   Rice, potatoes, Mac and cheese. Sneak into breakfast at a hotel, take anything portable home, like milk, bread, yogurt, fruit. I probably wouldn't eat the cocoa puffs. Fill a water bottle up in public places like a mall or library.   Pen, hair ties, pepper spray.    You need to detach yourself from these people, even if they are your blood.   I haven't heard anything but I applied early May. I would like to know because I don't want to start a new job and leave in February. For those that did receive anything, did you get an email or did you just keep checking the site?   I'll be honest here, stop crying about not having a cell phone. That's not your biggest problem and you need to step back and look at what you're saying. Get a track phone if you're so worried about it. Go to a library and apply for jobs. Ask for them to contact you via email. Go in person and hope for open interviews or an on the spot hire. You got this. If you can't afford a track phone (I think they're like $10/month), ask /r/assistance for help. Good luck, chief.   Its June 18 now bro   Maybe a kiosk   Okay, but sounds like you lived life and made some memories. Who knows if you would have had that opportunity when you were retired or something.   What did you spend it on?    The time I fell in love.   I wouldn't do much of anything other than introduce myself. That and shovel their sidewalk, mow their sidewalk, take in garbage cans if they're not home.    Yes. It's a really dirty high though. Also makes opiates more potent and cures the itchiness associated with it. Or maybe you gave her an STD and her vagina is really itchy.   Head over to /r/opiates or /r/opiaterecovery. They can definitely help. I urge you to try kratom or subs. But right now you wanna get antidiarrhea meds. Take a lot and sickness will be bearable. Are you on any anxiety meds? Those help.   Mint chocolate and anything fruity and chocolate.    hit up a free hotel breakfast.   you know the rule, if you post pill porn, you gotta share!   Well you need to make some chances, but don't go crazy right away. I think you need to sleep on it. You may want to make a rash decision now and quit but tomorrow you'll realize it'll cause you more problems. You boyfriend is not your world. You are your own person and responsible for your happiness. Start looking at new jobs but most importantly, get active. Do what you love to do and dedicated more time to these things. Experience life and look at work as a small part of life.    Either quit and work with your dad FT. OR quit and work at the new company.  Sounds like you shouldn't stay where you are.   I'd stay stick it out for a few more months, then look for something else and quit once you have a secure position. You say it doesn't challenge you-- how can you go above and beyond? Work outside your job description. Even if you don't want to be promoted to manager, you may keep your sanity.   Astray by let it happen. Disintegration by turnover.   dump your girl and ask new girl out.   Well, I think your case is a little extreme. What kind of underwear do you use? Get some cotton or something extremely absorbent. I get ass sweat, but only when doing cardio. I think you have a problem. Certain dry is good for armpits, may want to talk to someone about something similar for all parts of the body.  Botox is known to be used but not sure you want to go down that route.   Work boots.   What do you do for money? Do you need money? What is the average income? Are prices higher due to seclusion? Do you like it? Is it beautiful? How can I become a resident?   you could get aluminum window covers   Damn that sucks, but I know what you mean! That's how my work is now. I slave away and do amazing, yet they don't really care.  Electrical would be good. Plumbers, linemen. You start at the bottom but they pay for school and can end up making a real decent salary.   he's on some criminal minds shit. He wants to learn women's fears, then make their nightmare a reality to haunt them until their death.   Crackers. There are so many different kinds these days.

I'm under no illusions there cringy and horrible but fuck it there funny as shit to me and I'm a want to be a writer as well what does that make of my sense of humour ?   firstly i love cheesy comedy one of the reasons i love pierce brosnan as bond was because of the lines e.g i thought christmas only comes once a year. but i just like kevin bacon and stupid cheesy crap jokes      someone could win. is not about being financially responsible here in the uk it costs 2 i mean i know the odds and such but its possible my numbers can come up and for the excitement and dream its worth it. hey i could spend that 2 quid on a ticket and have the 'what if' feeling or i could buy another drink at lunch plus the lottery funds some great stuff over here i mean the freaking science museum is lottery funded so even if you don't win your doing a bit of good thats how i see it   im glad everyone is annoyed with this problem aswell    good point actually    i always thought a lot of him I'm stupidly rich and i like to reward my key players with good contracts. this kids always been a stand up fella he's hurt me Deji29... he's hurt me    so dumb this better get fixed. i mean it would be more realistic if the player said ' i want to live in france where it would be better for my family' that i can understand but not ambitious enough come on !   t.v in the bathroom, watching grease in the bath with a beer would be the dream. p.s yeah i like grease and what !   the funny thing is is that i offered him a new contract and he's totally willing to negotiate. sometimes this game is just plain dumb    i hear you brother    yeah i understand its just annoying. like i have won everything multiple times and he says its because ambition bloody stupid.          pencil skirts and glasses. or i good sundress    its not underrated its just shit   weird how she keeps saying she's a legitimate actress and her beauty prevents her from getting roles then choses a role when she wears a skin tight suit throughout.    and you do know banksy and the street art scene. arrogant cunt http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/f4mxs/i_briefly_worked_with_thierrymr_brainwash_from/     haha what a cool coincidence    why not loan out. i tend to think match experience is very important     any tips for training etc because i sometimes have trouble getting my players to reach there potential   there are some tough decisions to make ahead !      it does  	75
 Thanks so much, sorry I forgot to mention that I go to weekly therapy, and I am on my third different batch of anti depressants so already a step ahead ;)   Thank you so much :)    Hi all.   I've recently been diagnosed with depression, and am hoping to be diagnosed with borderline personality disorder which will make my condition easier to treat, and understand. However, in the process of weekly therapy, anti depressants and doctor appointments, I have lost my sex drive. I have gone from masturbating daily, to only doing it once a week or not even that. I feel I need to wear sexy lingerie to feel good about my body, and my partner constantly reassures me.   Unfortunately, my diagnosis came around when I was a young teen after being sexually, physically and mentally abused and sometimes this effects our sex life but we have this part under control. However my partner doesn't want to feel like he's forcing me to have sex with him, although he isn't, and so sometimes he goes without sex.   I just want some help on how to recover the drive, and spice things up a bit. Please keep in mind that this a serious post, and I'd appreciate if this was kept serious too.     In the shower, in my/his bed, we once tried on a wall outside his room but that was an epic fail. Lots of car sex too.   Truffles   Do you hate me for letting the vet cut off your balls?   I have recently been diagnosed with depression, and prescribed anti depressants. In the next weeks, myself and my SO are hoping I will finally be diagnosed with borderline personality disorder, as it with really help us understand every thing better.   In the meantime, I no longer initiate sex or anything sexual. I wear lingerie, purely because it makes me feel sexy and I find it hard to orgasm by myself. My sex drive has dropped from 100 to 30 in the space of a few months, and it is horrid for my.partner and I.   Any suggestions on how to get back the drive, or even advice on how to spice things up a bit.    I cry a lot when pleasure is too much, for example when my SO pounds into me, I cry as it is too much pleasure. I cry during spankings, canings and sometimes just cry because the adrenaline has passed my body and emotions overwhelm me. Crying is my way of releasing, if I don't cry then I'm not being pushed enough.   I've met people who giggle, or full blown laugh through scenes, not because they are ticklish but because they don't know what else to do!   	7
 Saturday I think. Boys are frustrating and dumb.   Idk whenever I have guys over they always want to watch tv or a movie but like, is rather just sit there and talk to them. I'm sure it depends on the girl but she might just want to sit down and have a conversation with you. I'm a loser.   "Be who you are and say what you feel, because those who matter don't mind and those who mind don't matter."  -Dr. Seuss   "Alice: How long is forever? White Rabbit: Sometimes, just one second." -Lewis Carrol  "Think about all the beauty still left around you and be happy." -Anne Frank    June 13th   Gross one time I went to the movies with my best friend and her boyfriend because I'm a gigantic idiot and at one point I looked over and his hand was literally in her pants like calm down please this is public   Be prepared for "LET ME TRY OM YOIR GLASSES" and "LMAO HOW MANT FINGERS AM I HOLDING UP" and "WOW YOURE BLIND HAHAHA". Also from personal experience, "Thanks, I need them to see" isn't the way to respond when someone compliments your glasses.   The only other John Green book I've ever read was Looking for Alaska, and it's my favorite book of all time. DEFINITELY worth reading. TFiOS was such a disappointment after that book.   Yup, that sounds about right. It actually did make me cry at one point just because he's so innocent. Keep reading to the end, it's worth it.   Dark hair and eyes. I always seem to like either tall, funny, chubby, nerdy white guys or cute Hispanic boys with nice smiles and cute accents.   Milkweed by Jerry Spinelli for school. 8/10. Made me feel some type of way.   FINALLY someone agrees with me. I liked the book but I definitely don't think it deserves all the praise it got.   I thought so too XD And it's dejaentenduude.tumblr.com   Well I suppose, but I'd rather be closer to home.   I looove Weezer and Vampire Weekend 3 I'll go listen to the one you recommended, lol   From Brand New I'd try The Boy Who Blocked His Own Shot or Magazines. From Bon Iver, try Skinny Love or Creature Fear. Some other bands to try are Counting Crows or The Wallflowers if you haven't already listened to them. What are your recommendations?   That's hard. None of them showed up on shuffle, but probably Bon Iver or Brand New.   I very much like your music taste :D and thank you!   WAIT I FOLLOW YOU ON TUMBLR. You liked on of my selfies on there the other day. What.   3   1. Rain King - Counting Crows 2. Stubborn Love - The Lumineers 3. This Too Shall Pass - OK Go 4. Pretty Girl (The Way) - Sugarcult 5.

Being from Detroit, the end always made me laugh way too hard.   Deja Entendu - Brand New Pure Heronie - Lorde For Emma, Forever Ago - Bon Iver  Probably my top 3 favorites ever    One of my top 3 favorites.   http://dejaentenduude.tumblr.com is mine, but it has no rhyme or reason, it's just whatever I happen to feel like reblogging   - I don't care about how big your penis is, please don't mention it anymore because it's creepy  - I wish you could just be open with me and tell me if you don't like me because it's emotionally exhausting trying to read you  - I feel like you're replacing me after we've been best friends for the last 5 years   For three different people.   That made me sad :(   The lack of being able to double tap to reply makes me cry   There's a guy who lives in my neighborhood with a bunch of reddit bumper stickers. Never actually talked to him.   Congrats on the medals to you guys too!(:   I think the paper planes are fun until matches start and people start giving speeches. I hope that the plane that landed by Dean wasn't actually aimed at him and was just unpredictably flying and happened to land by him (not that they should've been flown while he was talking anyway). But I think the planes can be fun if they're flown at the right times and aren't out of hand. But yeah, sucks to be whoever has to clean them all up.   That is awesome! I love all those teams. 51 is probably my favorite frc team besides my own and these teams all worked together extremely well   In the 33.3 percent. Fucking Detroit.   I'm sophomore in high school, that's my dream college oh my gosh    Reese's cups. Oh my god, do not let those things in my sight.   They're not super popular haha. But they're very eclectic, I love thence.   I originally wanted a cute short almost pixie-ish haircut but it's too hard to maintain since I have curly hair so now it's like shoulder length with a metric fuck ton of layers and straightened every day, parted to the side. I miss my long hair a lot tho.   Vices by Brand New. Ugh. Daisy in general was a bit of a flop imo. I still love it but it can't even compete with Dj Entendu or The Devil and God.   I wish I was less sensitive. Every little thing makes me upset. And I wish I was less of an open book and less trusting, because it has fucked me over in the past. Also I need to stop putting the feelings of others before my own feelings. Probably my biggest issue is my social anxiety though. I'd love to see a version of myself that isn't scared of social situations and that could talk to people my age without feeling awkward and walking away.   I had to end up learning gradually through internet, friends, vague things at school. I don't recall the exact age but yeah, my mother avoided the subject   YES. Wounded Healer is my favorite.   5: At college (REALLY hoping for Michigan tech or U of M) working on some kind of engineering degree 10: Steady job, steady income. Hopefully good friends and a good relationship. 20: Married with kids and a family, with an overall happy life, being able to continue an engineering career with good pay while doing something I love.   Spent it in St. Louis at the world champion robotics competition. Best time of my life.   I've literally NEVER heard of curving a quiz down. That's bullshitty.   I had zero interest in boys until fifth grade. Then it was a super tall redheaded boy with freckles and super green eyes. And he was really funny and could crack me up. Holy cow though my feelings were so strong at the time, probably because it was my first crush. But he's a douche now so lol oh well   ":c Feel better. Good night." To my ex boyfriend. Sigh.   Music and engineering. I like most sciences and stuff but damn I love engineering (especially that of the chemical and mechanical variety)   One time in 5th grade I had to go to the hospital because I got pencil lead stuck in my ear. That counts, right?   Bed: 12:00-2:00 Wake up: 5 on Tuesday/Thursday and 6:15 every other day  I'm not a smart person.   My team is from the Flint/Detroit area as well, so I know what you mean, lol. But I didn't even think about the Jr. FLL teams there. I already get nervous about the FRC and FTC teams, but at least we're all old enough to hold our ground, the FLL teams aren't. Aw. That's really scary. :(   I agree. I think the area as a whole is pretty sketchy. I read about a student on one team on here who got mugged outside the hotel. That could happen anywhere, but St. Louis really isn't the safest of all places in my opinion.   The build process on my team is very student-led. I think that the thing the mentors help with the most is designing the robot. While the mentors help on some things that they feel are dangerous for students to do, they try very hard to let us do the majority of the build. Usually when you have a question, the mentors will not give you a direct answer. They ask what you think the answer is and they walk you through the steps to get to the correct answer. I would rather have a robot that doesn't win a whole lot that is built all by students than have a robot that wins everything but was made by the mentors. I wouldn't feel like I could take as much credit since my team didn't actually build it, my mentors did. Granted, my team has 45 students and with that amount of people, we can work efficiently build a robot in 6 weeks. With smaller teams more mentor involvement is necessary in my opinion, because there are less people to give out their ideas and less people to work on the robot. I think that if the mentors did most of the work on the robot, it would almost be defeating the purpose of FIRST.   Good luck! We love the Thunder Chickens3   That's so unbelievably unsafe. Why is this not being reported or signal boosted? People shouldn't be paying 15 bucks for food poisoning and a coke.   What about if someone robs your house? By that logic, they should just be able to get away with it because "the law is bullshit" am I right?   We're in Galileo too, so good luck! I'll try to snag you a 3098 button if I get around to it (:   I'm from 3098 and LOVE your shirts. I don't really have anything to trade, but is there anywhere online where they are sold?   I have an ex boyfriend who is currently living across the country who I still try to help and support to no end and yet his friends still all hate me. He was just in the hospital, and his friends all gave up on him feeling better, and got mad at ME for staying positive and saying he would make it. Guess who got out of the hospital earlier this week? Him. While he was there, one of his friends told me "The reason he hasn't given up yet is because you don't want him to" After I tried telling him how much he was still needed and how he couldn't give up. The same thing happened in December. I broke up with him in a pretty bad way back in December and I have apologized sincerely, and I've even been TOLD that they all have forgiven me. Yet they still can't stand me and I've done nothing but try to help him and stay close friends with him. His friends are some of the most fantastic and protective and caring people I have ever talked to, and there have been times after we have broken up where I can joke with his friends and be extremely friendly, but that won't happen again anytime soon. The whole hospital situation really drew the "they really can't stand me" line, even though I supported every single one of them the best I could. We have stayed very close since we broke up, and I still love him. I don't think I could ever get back together with him though because I'm not very emotionally stable sometimes and don't trust myself with him. Additionally, our personality clashes have been really evident as of late. I'm an open book, and he hates talking about his feelings. I sometimes find It hard not to try to pry when I notice things are wrong. It caused a REALLY awful argument last month, and up until then we would still say I love you to one another, but we didn't think we were ready for an actual relationship again. As a couple, we never had those problems. If he ever offered a relationship again, I would tell him I would think about it, but as I think about it and am honest with myself, I realize how likely it is that I would actually get back together with him. Honestly, I still cry on a pretty regular basis when I realize how badly I fucked up by breaking up with him, and I was told a few weeks ago that he still kind of has feelings for another girl, and I felt really awful about that too. I'm not going to even try to talk to him for at least a couple of weeks. Things still need to cool down between me and his friends, and I think it's healthier for me to not try to talk to him. But god damn, do I love and miss him.   My favorite part is when you're in a hurry and you awkwardly have to slide past them and you end up brushing against them   Lola Montez - Volbeat I Wanna Be Yours - Arctic Monkeys Triggerfinger - Donkeyboy Latch - Disclosure This Too Shall Pass - OK Go Slipped - The National   That's awesome! :D   I feel you.   I already have my heart set on Michigan Tech.  I think I have a pretty good chance if getting in, considering my decent GPA (3.67), and the fact that I'm in my school's robotics program and am going to an engineering camp there this summer.    ... Smith. :(   This makes me sad.   Same thing happened to us at the Southfield district competition. A match got replayed for that reason after a powerhouse team lost a match, but other matches didn't get replayed when the same thing happened.   It was a lot of fun. Super excited for worlds.   250   As lame as it is I honestly l o v e d the Jason Mraz concert I went to in 2012.   [This](http://imgur.com/jTV436X) Was once a normal looking and intact big bird doll, but I took this thing literally EVERYWHERE from the time I was a baby until I was about 6. It means a lot to me because it's the one thing that sums up my time as a little kid because he went everywhere that I went, and all the paint chips and limbs being halfway torn off have little stories.  	71
 Here's to a man with hundreds of chemical creations and thousands of psychedelic experiences under his belt... Truly inspiring. RIP   It seems to me that if an analog is discovered and subsequently marketed as "not for human consumption", then it is treated as if it is not yet scheduled, which implies that it would be legal. The Federal Analog Act specifies that analogs of Schedule I or II substances are only illegal if intended for human consumption:      * (C) [Controlled substance analogue] does not include -   * (iv) any substance to the extent not intended for human consumption before such an exemption takes effect with respect to that substance.      Let me know if you think I'm interpreting this incorrectly.   LSZ is an RC analog of LSD that people claim to be stronger and more euphoric. It is unscheduled in the U.S. and can be purchased online from RC vendors. It's a psychedelic but I thought I'd mention it anyway.   LSD shud be the only one with no taste.  Not necessarily. LSD can have a metallic taste to it. But from my understanding NBOMEs will make your tongue feel numb, while LSD won't.   /r/DarkNetMarkets   So something like this?  http://i.imgur.com/egimb.jpg  Found this on a bluelight thread (http://www.bluelight.org/vb/archive/index.php/t-637070.html)   If you're into electronic music, I would suggest Flying Lotus, Boards of Canada, XXYYXX, Emancipator, Tycho and Com Truise.  I would say take care in choosing which Boards of Canada songs you play though since I remember the vibes getting very weird with certain songs. Also, it can't hurt to listen to all the music you're planning on tripping to beforehand so you can carefully choose the vibes you want (i.e. chilled or upbeat).   This is pretty bad. Can you provide a link to a paper/report/etc that describes this process?   'rita' is Ritalin, which is one of a couple brand names for methylphenidate.   It's after incidents such as these that the importance of testing your tabs should be reiterated. Buy some Ehrlich reagent (from Amazon, etc.) and test a tab from every batch you buy. Stay safe!   I'm hoping for a new class of empathogens or partial agonists of the 5-HT set of receptors. Ideally the bioavailability of these new drugs would be very high, even with more traditional ROAs such as oral or sublingual, in addition to having higher binding affinities for the receptors they target. Perhaps I'm ignorant of the biochemical and/or neuropharmacological limitations on the existence of any drug that fits this profile, but one can hope.   are you a tourist? you should try some special truffles while you're there.   i think it's pretty over-engineered. decent attempt at producing a trap album from drama. not the worst of all wiz's tapes though in my opinion   Chance the Rapper: "Music and tabs of lucy, take your chance with this rapper"   "I did it all without a Drake feature" love it   maybe you'll find more help over at /r/drugnerds   What's the book called? I'm interested.   I tripped alone once, just listen to some nice chill music. Or you can keep it off and experience where your mind takes you. Ambient light or darkness is the best.   "I deeeed it"   I would say try Wolfram Alpha or Mathematica (the former is a subset of Mathematica, but is available online).   See http://reference.wolfram.com/mathematica/ref/Zeta.html   Like EEBrony said however, the best you can get is an approximation.   However, if you want better precision within Java (i.e. better than using 64-bit floating point), try using java.math.BigDecimal instead of double for the variable z. It's a bit slower since you need to use methods within the BigDecimal class to perform operations, but you get the benefit of arbitrary precision arithmetic as well as better precision.   Tycho - Dive      assert contentsOfYourBrain == null.     In all seriousness though, I am of the belief that var == null and var != null seem to be the best for clarity. It also seems to be fairly idiomatic.   Dabs, kief bowls or 10 bong rip challenge. Not one after another though haha   About a quarter of the way through the story I'm thinking, "This guy's definitely a writer." Aaaand you're a writer haha. Excellent story. Good luck with your education and hobbies. Hopefully you will run into someone who smokes soon enough.   College ent here. So me and my buddy were in my dorm enjoying some bong hits and music last Friday when another guy i know knocks on the door with his friend. After the new guy introduces himself, he sees that I'm already high and asks me if I'm an ent. I get pretty excited and say yes. Apparently we both browse /r/trees every day. He was a very chill guy too.    Then they told me they both came over intending to get high as fuck. So they both throw $10 and I start packing bowls on bowls. After about 5 hits each they were both about to go to sleep. I think I got to 12 rips, and i got pretty high but i was still awake (tolerance). So i woke them up and jokingly asked if they wanted more, and they both laughed and declined the offer. They both went on their way shortly after. Such a chill night.   tl;dr i met an ent and we smoked, talked and had a great time. ents are great people.   I was going to put the series representation of pi in brackets as a lame math joke but then I realized there's no TeX support on this sub, unlike /r/math :/      Great drawing though, toke on.   Shit man thats some great pancake man [7}  	28
 Star wars.   Get ready for school. I was 5.   Chose his girlfriend over me.   Sounds exactly like her, if her stuff went walkabout and I was visiting FI then it would be an angry phone call demanding to know why I'd taken the item in question. Even though I knew my own innocence she would never believe it and tell me she "knew" I was lying. Looking back on it now she was probably projecting her own guilty conscience onto me.   My NSis used to take my stuff all time, when her and EBIL were first dating she would steal my straighteners and take them to his flat. Her reasoning for this was because I was unemployed and she wasn't, she needed them more for work. One time I was visiting my FI when we were still in a LDR, I'd left my suitcase by the front door and she went through it while I was sleeping and took the straighteners with her to work. I didn't find out until I got to his and phoned her. She decided that since we would "probably stay at his all weekend and play video games [I] didn't need them."  Another time she borrowed a cardigan for a night out with her work, for 4 weeks after this night out I asked for it back and was met with excuses of it being in the wash or lost in her bedroom (which was/is a disaster zone). One morning I got a phone call from her giggling away, evidently she'd lost my cardigan on that night out and decided I didn't need to know but wasn't she amazing for finding it? (It turned out a co worker had put it in his bag and had only just found it.) She couldn't understand why I was angry with her, even after she admitted she had had no intention of telling me the truth if it hadn't been found.   Who do I ask about getting one of those? It's never been mentioned at my university. I'll need to email some people in September.  	6
 I like a lot of indie/alternative, and some electronic stuff. Some of my favorites are The Arcade Fire, Joy Division, Grizzly Bear, Radiohead, Purity Ring, and The National.   As I've grown older I've fallin in love with classical music, especially Romantic and Impressionist composers. My favorite composer is Debussy. There's something that I've found in his music that I can't find anywhere else.   [Debussy- Arabesque 1](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28Qi4jLtigc)   The other night I was out with some new people who'd I'd never gone out with before. They asked me a lot of questions , and I was a little caught off guard having to talk about myself so much. I'd been drinking quite a bit, and I know that didn't help, but I just couldn't find interesting things to say about myself. I pretty much just threw my hands up and said I'm boring. I'm taking a year off university and am living in a city I'm unfamiliar with. I don't know how to make that sound interesting. I wanted to get the spotlight and have them talk about themselves a little bit more. Talking about myself made me feel vulnerable, and I think I should come up with some prefabricated answers about myself to just spew out when people ask me. What's the best way to talk about yourself without sounding like a complete narcissist?   I've come to the point where I think I've realized how much self-consciousness is part of my character. I just can't help being and acting self-conscious all the time. I just went out with friends, and I'm thinking about how I drank too much, talked to too many people, and danced way crazier than everyone else. I'm trying to get myself to go out and meet people, realize that I'm going to make mistakes (sometimes overdo it) and then learn from it, but I just can't seem to pull myself out of my ingrained self-consciousness. Half the time when i joke around it's at my own expense and it's just frustrating to see myself do that again and again. I guess the only way to get over it is to keep going forward and learn from my mistakes, but I wish there was an easier way.    Thanks! It's been a little strange. I was having real problems with the sedative affect that Mirtazapine had, I always stuck in a brain fog, but now I'm feeling quick and judgemental. It's a funny combination of feelings; I guess I'll just have to wait to see how things balance out.   So I've got my prescription reduced from 45 mg every night to 15 mg. This is the third day on the lower dose, and I think I'm still adjusting because I've been in a funny mood. I've all the sudden become really judgemental, but unlike before I'm not teetering on despair. It's like being lucidly aware of being in a crappy mood, so I'm sort of laughing about it.  I'm being a bit more outwardly negative, but I only feel a little bit worse than I did before. I was wondering if any of you have experienced anything similar when switching doses.   I'm on 45mg of mirtazapine. It really helped me when I was at my lowest; it  gave me something solid to stand on and gave me the motivation to work on myself. Now that I'm doing much better I'm going to see about getting off of it. I think it's affecting my speech and ability to think clearly. Also, it will knock you out, and for me the sedative affect doesn't wear off for a few hours after I wake up.   It's actually what makes me doubt my psychologist. I get very emotionally invested in fiction.  I wouldn't say that I get 'attatched' but I feel what the characters do and enjoy that a lot.    I've got this story that I keep telling people, and I just wanted to run it by /r/socialskills to see whether or not you think this is one I should keep to myself. Everyone who has worked customer service has their own war stories to tell about the people who they've had to serve. I used to work at a video store that rented a lot of porn and I have lots of weird stories about the kinds of people that'd come in. I'm just wondering if those stories probably comes off as a bit creepy or as  funny anecdotes about working customer service. I told it to some people tonight, and it seemed to go over well, those stories might be off putting. Just looking for some input.   I'm on 45 mg of Remeron. I'll make sure to bring it up to my psychiatrist.   Anxiety is making me trip up every time I talk to someone. I often pause and get caught up midway through a sentence. It's making my social anxiety even worse than it already is, because it's usually better if I just don't say anything. I know what I'm trying to say, but when I'm trying to say it I usually stumble. When I stumble I usually defer to longer words and it just comes across very awkward. Now that I'm thinking about how I speak all the time it's just gotten worse. Do any of you have any advice for managing speaking anxiety while avoiding putting too much pressure on socializing?      I've started reading poetry aloud. It's really good practice.    I've always been really impressed by people who can express themselves without saying a lot. It seems to me that this is a really important social skill that would help make conversation more fluid and interesting. I tend to over think what I'm saying, and have noticed that I sometimes ramble and stumble over myself when I'm trying to convey an idea or opinion. Do any of you have any advice for speaking more efficiently? What are some ways to stop over thinking what you say while still being conscious about what you say and how you say it?    I often feel like it comes worst at times when it feels like it's appropriate to say something, but I just have nothing to say I have some idea of what I'm going to say, but by the time I get to actually saying it it comes out a mess. For example, I was trying to relay to my brother what I thought about a business idea he'd come up with and why his educational background gives him an advantage in the field he's hoping to go into, but it just came out a complete disaster and made the conversation awkward.    I used to monologue a lot, but I don't as much now. Even when I'm having a seemingly normal conversation with other people it seems like I get cut off a lot. I don't know whether it has to do with the rhythm of my speaking or if the people I spend time with are just rude.    I've noticed lately that I'm having trouble transferring thoughts and concepts into speech. Sometimes the words get confused and come out wrong, and other times it feels like I haven't fully put together an idea before I begin speaking. It often ends up sounding like I'm beating around an idea without actually saying anything. It's like I have it all sorted out in my head (generally), but when I actually go to tell other people about it it just comes out vague and sometimes nonsensical. It's made conversations more awkward, because sometimes I take a moment to recollect my thoughts, and other people think that that's an opportunity to cut in. This is incredibly frustrating, and I'm having a lot of anxiety about it.   Have any of you experienced this? Is this an AS thing?   The other day a co-worker stopped me and asked if I was alright. I asked "why do I look upset?" She stopped for a second and said " It's just that when you're not serving customers your eyes look like you're on the verge of tears." I was caught off guard. I told her it was just the weather and that I hadn't been getting enough sleep, but for someone to read me like blew me away.   I'm not all together bad at talking to strangers when they are 100% strangers, but when it's someone who I have a social obligation to talk to because of the friends of friends thing I have problems. It doesn't seem like they take much interest in me either, so I'm always the one trying to find something to talk about.   Sometimes I have trouble talking with strangers, but it's nothing compared to talking to acquaintances especially when the conversation is 1 on 1.    Man this is something I've always struggled with. How do you become friends with your friend's friends? I said goodbye to some friends' at the airport and was in a group with their friends. I'd met those people a few times before, but I never became "friends" with them. After we left the airport one of them said they could give me a ride home. That was the single most awkward moment of my life. I tried to make small talk and talk about our common friends, but i failed miserably, and that's why I'm asking this.    I've been taking my medication (45 mg of Remeron) since July, and for the most part it's been a great help. There are a few days every month where I don't feel quite like myself. I feel foggy, like my perception is clouded, and I'm pretty sure it's the medication.    I missed a dose of my medication last night (I got home really late and forgot about it), so this evening I've been feeling very irritable and self-conscious. My evening was spent complaining to my family and being really self-conscious about what I was saying. I was running a meta-conversation about how it's not normal for someone my age (21) to be candid about his problems. To say the least, missing my medication made me act oddly, and quickly caused my symptoms to come back.  Have any of you experienced a fast reemergence of symptoms after missing a dose of your medication? Is it normal to have such a strong reaction?   Major depressive disorder and generalized anxiety with obsessive traits. I have social anxiety sometimes.   I think that I like it in concept. There's something appealing about just having a one off encounter with someone, or just no-strings-attached sex. I've been in situations where I could have had casual sex a few times, but every time so far I've passed it up. There was a lot of social reasons I didn't have casual sex with the women I could have. I didn't affect other friendships or make things messy even in a no-strings-attached situation.   I've always thought that it'd satisfy me in the short term but leave me feeling alone. Part of being an INFJ is sort of having an idealized view that's difficult to make real. I used to wish true love existed, but I don't think I can or want to anymore. I've tried to separate sex from affection, because it seems easier to cope with relationships that way.   Lately I've been trying hard to stop talking about myself unless someone asks. I've stopped giving my opinion or making statements and observations unless someone asks me directly. I've even stopped sharing relevant experiences I've had even when it wouldn't be entirely out of place.   My conversations have improved and people seem to be responding to me better than ever before. The conclusion I've come to is that most people have no interest in what others have to say, most of the time, and to become a better conversationalist you have to say and ask really general things. Any kind of definitive statement, observation, or opinion slows down most conversations so I guess to be a better conversationalist it's best to avoid them.  Do you agree or disagree? I'd like to hear what people have to say.     I'm like you, I can make easy banter with strangers almost no problem but friends/acquaintances/people I'd like to get to know I have more of a problem with. I think that the anonymity of talking to strangers takes off that social pressure edge and allows me to be a witty, flirty and overall charming person. When with friends on the other hand I feel like its some sort of serious balancing act. I'm always questioning how I should say things; is the conversation going to be idle chit chat or are we going to discuss our lives and feelings, what things should I keep to myself, should I ask some more personal questions? I feel like when I'm invested in another person I have this pressure to impress.   I think trying to strike a balance between casual conversation with friends, and real deep meaningful conversation is really important and easier said than done. Personally I've had relationships turn to only deep conversation and each time I'd hang out with those people everything seemed really melancholy. I love engaging, in-depth conversations, but I've tried to limit how much I have them lately. They can always lead to someone getting offended or it becoming a bit of an argument if your not careful. If someone else initiates them I'll give take part, but I usually don't bring weighty stuff to the table anymore because it makes most people uncomfortable.   Small talk isn't usually really about anything in my experience, it's more about socializing with other people, reading their body language making them laugh that kind of thing. It's more of a go with the flow kind of social bonding. I think often there's more socializing going on when people participate in small talk than when people are talking about weighty things.       I have a horrible habit of being sarcastically self-deprecating when I feel awkward in a social situation. For example me and some friends were joking around about some of them visiting each other when a few of us move to another region of our country. Anyway during the conversation no one seemed to mention for a few minutes that I was going to be living there too (everyone else is moving to a town just outside of the city I'll be moving to) anyway everyone was making plans about visiting that city and staying with friends they have there. I was about to mention that people could stay with me when someone else did for me saying it in a tone was like, Oh how could we have forgotten that test_subject2960 will be there too!. I laughed and played the obvious oversight off as sort of "Oh I don't really matter anyway don't worry about it!"Very Sarcastic obviously joking, but I don't like that sort of self-deprecation and I have a tendency to react in that way without thinking. How can I learn to stop doing this and work on playing things off in a more confident way?   Lately I've been trying to improve my banter with other people but its made my interactions so awkward I barely want to leave my house. Its like I'm analyzing my own thoughts and speech as I'm talking. Its making me trip over really simple sentences, or give really long explanations for simple things because I'm in overdrive trying to think of what would be the best way to say something.   I'm want to be more confident and comfortable in the way I interact with others. I'm trying to watch what I say, keep things casual, banter, and be funny, but by trying to be more savvy with what I say and how I interact I'm messing up more than ever. Really I try to think of the best way to respond in a conversation, but the overanalysis is just weighing me down. At the same time if I don't pay attention to what I'm saying I'll say something stupid.  For example a coworker the other day mentioned that it was Mother's day in the UK and said she'd wished her Mom happy Mother's day. I knew she had lived in the UK for a few years so it wasn't completely random, but all I could come up with was asking her if there were any other "holidays" that were different there then in North America. That's a stupid question, I probably should have asked her something like if she's still doing something for her Mom for north american mother's day or something like that. Later she was talking about some neat little piece of tupperware she had and all I did was say it was neat  and that I probably need to start collecting neat little things like that because I'll be moving out on my own soon.   Those are just two examples, they don't seem too awkward there but it was weird stilted conversation. On top of that anytime that I open my mouth I feel I need to psych myself up and what comes out is usually just really confused speech. Like trying to talk to one of the registrars at my university about a form I lost myself mid sentence and pretty much had to apologize and start over. I don't know what to do, it's like there's a mess between my brain and my mouth and I can't fix it.  Anybody got any ideas?    My therapist has recently brought up the possibility that I might have aspergers syndrome or another mild form of autism. Looking at my behaviour and the way I interact with people, I don' think this is entirely out of the ballpark. As far as I can tell the advantage of getting a diagnosis would be that I'd be realistically able to know some of my limitations and understand why I interact with the world the way I do. If there are any other reasons why I should or shouldn't pursue a diagnosis I'd like to hear them   I don't really know where to start when it comes to getting a diagnosis. so I'm just fielding this to see if any of you have any advice on where to get started.     Since I started working on my anxiety I've noticed something about myself and was wondering if others have similar behaviour. I find I vent my anxieties to people close to me almost compulsively. It's such a weight off my shoulders to ask my family or friends, but sometimes I feel like I'm holding people hostage in conversations. I feel like I need to get some stuff off my chest and I don't know how else to go about it. I am seeing a therapist and I'm on medication, and while those have helped few things give the instant relief that talking to my parents or close friends give. I don't really like having this need, and I hate feeling like I'm pushing my problems on other people (its really selfish and self-involved). I also feel it makes me incredibly vulnerable and makes me seem weak.  Do any of you experience the same thing? Do you have any suggestions to limit or completely stop the need to vent?    Yeah, this seems to be the main thing that I need to work on!   Tonight I was out with some friends and we were having a few drinks (definitely not helping the situation) and one of them asks me some questions about what I'm planning on doing when I go back to college next year. I felt like what they asked for was a pretty tall order because I've sort of been bouncing between a few different things ( the old do what you love or do what makes money thing) Anyway I felt like I went a little too in depth with my describing what I've been thinking about doing for school.   That's just an example really, I don't go on long winded monologues but often times I feel like a conversation gets focused on me somehow or what I'm up to. I feel like the conversation is reciprocated but I feel foolish giving my opinions or input all the time. I don't know why it is but I feel other people don't open up as much as I do and when I give my opinion or add a relevant story to the conversation I end up feeling like I've said too much and it makes me feel unappealing and vulnerable.  Do any you have any suggestions for reining in how much personal input I give, or how much input is appropriate when I'm just bantering with people?  	30
 most likely gallery items  **Holy fucking nope, Batman.**  If I lost my gallery I would be inconsolable.  That is like the one thing I've put most of my efforts on.  What the fuck.  **EDIT:** HEY GUYS would it help if I checked the 'login birthday prompt' on my site preferences?  It gives a birthday prompt when someone is logging in from an unknown location.   There is none, it never actually got released.  So I can't dress it up in dress to impress lol   He was willing to wait for me to be ready for sex, but I ended the relationship because I did not want to give him that impression.  I knew I would never want to be intimate with him like that, so I broke it off to avoid pulling him along.  I say that like it was a simple thing, but it was terribly sad.    Honestly, I'll not even consider dating another person unless they're asexual.  ):  It's just there aren't many asexual people out there, so the chances of me being alone are pretty high.   From what I have experienced, sexual attraction is different from romantic attraction.  Romantic attraction is the emotional response to a person.  I liked being around him and spending my time with him and being affectionate with him.  I did not know how to define sexual attraction at least, until someone described it as being hungry and having a plate of your favorite food sitting in front of you, and wanting to eat it.  Honestly, I've never wanted to ravage anybody, or have it done to me, gentle caress, or whatever.  Not even kissing.  It was always emotionally based for me.  I am capable of being romantically attracted to men, and I find them aesthetically pleasing-- but the romantic attraction is *always* at the forefront.    I was not tipped off about the asexuality until I tried doing stuff with my second boyfriend and I felt disgusted with myself.  Even with my previous boyfriend before that, I felt a similar feeling, but just ended it before I could really think about it.  No matter how much I cared about him and trusted him, it was always disgust with myself when the matter came to sex.  Masturbation by myself is okay, and I have certain fantasies, but the thought of actually doing anything with any of them or of just normal sex sounds awful.  That probably makes so little sense haha.  I cannot fathom what it is like for a person to lose themselves in lust toward another willing person.  Kind of wish I did, it must be pretty exciting.  :P  But oh well  	4

 Make sure notifications are enabled again in the stock messages app. SMS replacement apps disable stock notifications so you don't get double.    SlimBean has a feature called "The Real Dark Slim" which nightmode-ifies all the system apps on your phone (from messages to the play store). For this to work with gapps like gmail and play store, you have to flash the slimbean gapps (I think). This is because the setting just switches out the apks for the inverted ones when you turn it on and vice versa.    Can't say I've run into that issue yet, on any ROM. Sorry.    To be honest I'm not entirely sure. I'd flash the slimbean package just to be safe.    Battery life is about the same, 18-22 hours with 3-4 hours SOT.   **ROM Name:** Slim Bean  **ROM Version:** 4.3 Build 1 (09/15)  **Android Version:** 4.3  **Download Link:** [slimroms.net](http://www.slimroms.net/index.php/downloads)  **Kernel:** Slim-4.3-JWR-RC-1.1 (default ROM kernel)  **General Feedback:** I initially tried this ROM because it was one of the few ROMs that had a JWR+JSS hybrid kernel - I was on CM 10.2 nightlies w/ Franco kernel and I kept running into the JSS deadlock issue. I initially intended it to be a temporary thing but after running this ROM for a few days, there is nothing I miss from CM (read: SlimBean has all of CM's features) but I would certainly miss some features of this ROM if I went back, so it looks like I'll be staying for the foreseeable future.  **Hardware Comments:** Nothing really comes to mind... there have been no bumps in the road in terms of hardware issues, which is to be expected from a Nexus device.  **Features:** All of CM's features + way more (and their ROM size is somehow ~100mb smaller than the average CM release!). My favourite have been the way they handle custom navigation buttons/layouts (the UI/options for it are better than CM's implementation IMO, plus you can do things like have custom actions done on long-press of a button, which as far as I'm aware of, isn't available on CM) and transparent navbar and notification bar on the homescreen (which results in a simply beautiful [homescreen](http://i.imgur.com/c49K0Tk.jpg)). There are just so many more options for things, and it doesn't at all seem bloated.  **Stability   Performance:** Both have been absolutely stellar on the stable release. On CM10.2 I was experiencing daily random reboots and keyboard freezes due to bugs in the JSS AOSP build - granted I was running a nightly of CM compared to a stable release, but CM only has nightlies for Android 4.3 ATM and I wanted to be on the latest. It just seems lighter overall.  **Caveats   Warnings:** Honestly, at this stage, absolutely none. I've been gushing about this ROM to all my friends (well, those who know what a custom ROM is) ever since I installed it. I have only been running it for 3 or 4 days though, so there may be some hidden bug that I have yet to discover.   I'm in the market for an alternative messaging app myself, here's a few that I've found;  [88SMS](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.thinkleft.eightyeightsms.mms) - Pretty much the stock SMS pulled from Jellybean with some enhancements (such as quickmessage popup, night mode and emoji support)  [Textra](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.textra) - Quite nice. I used this for quite a while before switching back to stock.  [Pansi SMS](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pansi.msg) - Has a very similar UI/style to iOS 7 messaging, I suggest you give this one a try if you like the iOS 7 messaging.  [Now SMS](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=crometh.android.nowsms) - Google Now-inspired UI  [Sliding Messaging](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.klinker.android.messaging_donate) - This has the best UI out of all of the messaging apps (IMO). The hangouts UI and animations are just phenomenal. The only reason I'm not using this as my only SMS app is the fact that it freezes quite often. Really unfortunate.   Source?   In the meantime you can install supersu. Should fix the issue.    [Auto HD for Youtube](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/auto-hd-for-youtube/koiaokdomkpjdgniimnkhgbilbjgpeak)   Yeah its fine. Running it now.    Uhh, no. 10.2 is based on aosp 4.3. There is no 10.3 and there are only nightly releases for 10.2 at the moment.    You can do that with onandroid, which is tightly integrated with nandroid manager.    But that's where I'm confused. I'm not talking about restoring the whole nandroid - nandroid manager allows you to explore the nandroid and pull individual apks and their data from the nandroid.    I'm actually confused why it seems that everyone does a backup of their apps AND a nandroid (which includes the /data partition anyway!). I simply do a nandroid and restore my apps/texts/wifi passwords from the nandroid itself using [Nandroid Manager](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.h3r3t1c.bkrestore). Saves a lot of time and storage space.   S3 mini? Wouldn't bet on it.    Why stay on 4.2?   I was in the exact same position as you a few days ago. Was rocking an S2 and I hadn't done any research on the sim tray so when my N4 finally arrived I realized I couldn't just pop my sim in. Cut it down to size with a pair of pliers and a nail file. Took me about an hour and it works fine.    Nope, only the 10.2 9/6 and 9/7 nightlies (as the title says).    Except for the part where, on some devices, nightlies are the only option for CM.    Well that's wrong. I dirty flashed the 9/6 nightly over the 9/5 one and it still didn't boot.    Meant to say CM 10.2 in the title *  [XDA Thread](http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=2408130 page=15)   Did you do a full wipe and use the latest gapps package?   To be fair, it didn't commit suicide. You dropped it...   But is there really? I mean if the n4 had hardware buttons, wouldn't they be in the same place as the software ones and the screen would be smaller? I don't get this argument.    Did you download the latest gapps package?   I think its a software issue with the default camera app. I have this lag on the default camera app but not CM's Focal.    You can talk about them, just don't make it obvious that they are an ex. Simply say "my friend" or "a girl I know" etc.  After breaking up with my girlfriend of 4 years, I realized that most, if not all, of the interesting anecdotes of my life that would be good in a conversation were with her present. This is an easy way to tell those stories without directly advertising the fact that she was my partner.    The camera shortcut is hard coded into the lockscreen, similar to how the camera shortcut on iPhones are. Your best bet is a lockscreen replacement.    I'm pretty sure that this isn't possible unless the app dev specifically codes it.    An app called nandroid manager can restore data + apps (including SMS and mms) from a nandroid.             https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/chromoji-emoji-for-google/cahedbegdkagmcjfolhdlechbkeaieki?hl=en-GB   I recently visited an abandoned mental asylum with a friend.

There isn't really a "cure" or way to "beat" it, you just learn to live with it and manage it in a way that allows you to have a relatively happy life. For some people this means medication and others therapy (oftentimes both).

I think this is due to me overexposing the shot. Even though I shot in RAW I don't seem to be able to prevent the highlights from being so blown out. Any suggestions?   Not exactly new here but its my first post and I have a tendency to over process, just wondering what you guys thought;  processed: http://i.imgur.com/rn88uV0.jpg  original: http://i.imgur.com/doLvzfW.jpg   pushbullet   Not entirely correct. A parallel for self harm is (arguably) drug use. Some people do it to look cool/for attention and others do it because they do derive pleasure for it and it is a coping mechanism... I am probably wrong here (I don't have a source for you and I'm on my phone) but I remember reading somewhere that self harm releases endorphins into the body in response to the pain, and people can get addicted to that as well.   There are also the psychological reasons behind it, such as feeling in control (when the self harmer feels that all other aspects of their life are out of their control, so they self harm because they can control the pain and it makes them feel empowered)  And say what you want about attention seeking, but if someone is so desperate for attention that they feel the only way to get it is to deface their body, don't you think they need some help, regardless of the severity of their self harm?      You obviously don't know much about anxiety. Although it is a mental illness, anxiety manifests itself in sometimes debilitating physical ways. Saying that people that suffer from anxiety suck for not just manning up and dealing with people is similar to telling a person without legs to "just walk" and getting angry at them for not doing so.   What controller are you using?   [Stepmonster](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjXt-TgqXhs). It was rated as a child's movie but it really should have been for mature audiences... I had severe night terrors from it for almost an entire year. Awful.   Lied to me and broke my trust multiple times, then had the nerve to turn around and claim that I was the one who didn't love her. She was co-dependent on me being depressed and miserable, and when I started medication and getting better the relationship started to turn sour. Then, when I broke up with her, she made me out to be some psycho and that I broke up with her because she was hanging out with a gay guy, when she knows full well that I left her because of trust issues we'd been struggling with for well over a year (because of *her* actions).  I loved her and genuinely thought I was going to spend the rest of my life with her. She was my best friend and soulmate, but best friends don't do that to each other, especially if they are supposedly in love.   I love the new UI, but there is one issue that bugs me: with the previous version, when you launched the app it would automatically open up to the last screen/activity you had when you were in the app (for me this would often be all songs in alphabetical order). The new app no longer does this, and instead always opens directly to the "listen now" page.  I only use my phone to play songs in my car, so it is quite annoying with the new app, as it takes 7-8 taps and swipes to get to "all songs" when it previously took one.   Just an fyi, you can't have a link + text post in the same post. Its a limitation (or intentional design choice) of reddit itself, not your app.   For the sake of technicality, the features oi are talking about are just Google Search. Google Now is a part of Google search that automatic all populates the search page with relevant cards/info, without user input.    Has anyone ever told you you look like [Ali Larter](http://images4.fanpop.com/image/photos/20900000/Ali-Larter-ali-larter-20919460-1600-1200.jpg)?

No, it requires a data connection to function.    http://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/1efl52/what_features_need_to_be_added_to_google_hangouts/  http://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/1ef9yp/the_new_hangouts_am_i_missing_something_heres_my/  http://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/1ef71j/hanging_out_with_google_hangouts_googles_new/   Letmewatchthis and 1channel are actually the same site.   Its almost as if the internet is full of people with varying opinions.    Just try both and stick with the one you like the best. ROMs are like softdrink flavours; you can't have someone tell you your preference.   they don't just push out builds if they are not 100% satisfied they are production ready for end users.  Uhh, that is objectively incorrect. The last "M" build put a few of the Galaxy line in a bootloop.   To be fair, PS2 is terribly unoptimized.

Are you sure its **SMS** and not a Facebook message? Make sure you try to input multiple *phone numbers* and that the send button is **green**. Because when I try, on the latest Messenger app, it gives me this; http://i.imgur.com/S9ZQU4x.png   If you are only using ChompSMS for the popup than [this](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.everythingandroid.smspopup feature=search_result#?t=W251bGwsMSwxLDEsIm5ldC5ldmVyeXRoaW5nYW5kcm9pZC5zbXNwb3B1cCJd) might be of interest to you.   Just to be clear, the comment above yours is talking strictly about FB Messages only. You can set Messenger to handle SMS as well, but it does not support group SMS (try adding more than one **phone number** to a message, it gives you an error). It also doesn't support the sending of MMS, so you have to switch back to Go SMS or stock MMS to send pictures.   Huh? Just tap the edge of the page.    The 2 year club is a lonely one, my friend.   Sorry, you just confused me here;  Nope, sorry  Which implied that what I was saying was wrong. It isn't, stock android does not have this feature.  ninja edit: btw, the feature is system-wide for iOS. It probably has to be hard-coded into the app for the touchwiz implementation. Am I correct in saying that the same feature wouldn't work in 3rd party apps eg. Chrome or Facebook?   That is specific to samsung devices. We're talking about stock android here.   In iOS, tapping the notification bar in a scrollable app/view will scroll quickly to the top of it. Eg in safari you read a page and scroll down through a blog post or something, and then you want to quickly get to the top to click on one of the site's navigation buttons, you just tap the top bar. In android you have to scroll up.    You know you can disable chat heads, right?   Thanks for the comments, I'll definitely fix up the horizon on that photo. I had trouble with the exposure because this is the first time I've taken photos in such harsh light, I really should have shot in RAW but I didn't, they're JPGs so I couldn't get much more of the sky out of them (well, I could get some back on a few of them, like you said). They are mostly unedited except for the first few, so I'll go back over them and try to fix up the things you suggested. Thanks!   Might be a bit late, but here's a few shots I took a couple of months ago with my girlfriend; http://imgur.com/a/sQDBt      This was all over r/android a few days ago haha.    http://i.imgur.com/xlkHses.gif   Or just from fat princess, the game...   There have been numerous posts about this issue over the years since Android's release. Someone ended up making a google docs spreadsheet of all the apps that did it the correct way, can anyone provide a link?   That was only a secondary point. My main argument was that he was saying Facebook? oh that's probably why I have no idea (HAHA GUYS LOOK I DON'T USE FACEBOOK) instead of a "Oh okay, I don't use Facebook so I wasn't aware." or better yet, no reply at all...   Well that doesn't mean much, the Facebook app is codenamed katana.    He was downvoted because he said it condescendingly - like "Facebook? Too mainstream for me, no wonder I have no idea what it is." Not only that but fb home / chat heads has been all this subreddit has talked about for the last few days. Its kinda hard to miss.    You actually don't need to change all those values, if you change model, name and device to i9300 it works.   No, it doesn't. I really wish it worked like that but it doesn't. Activating the SMS feature simply creates a new chat thread for each contact, so you have two for each one; SMS and Facebook messages. If you want to send them a Facebook message, you have to go to the fb one and its the same for SMS. It does not intelligently switch between the two a la iMessage. Which is such a shame because I would really love it if it did that.   It does show as incompatible on the play store. This is the screen you get when you manually install the apk on an unsupported device.    Yeah it doesn't merge the two, you've got two separate threads for each person.    4.2.x+ supports group messaging.    How big is the 2000mah one? Does it fit inside the stock casing?

To be honest I barely get a day (16 hours) with my SGS2 on CM10.1. I have nothing to compare it to either, cause I've been flashing AOSP roms on it since day 1.

The new start menu is a purely aesthetic change, literally no functionality has been lost when compared with windows 7.    Why?   The problem with that is that there were numerous parts in the game that forced you to fight (ie there was no choice to run away)   I think a little bit of in game dialogue would fix this issue. "Did you see that?" "See what?"  And the fact that it would still occur in split screen, when no possible latency could be occurring.    Droid wall in whitelist mode.   	110

 Five (though possibly more to come) schools, containing in total over 1000 pupils, were found to have been 'taken over' by Muslims with extremist beliefs. The classrooms were covered in posters written only in Arabic, they were heavily pressured to fast and there are reports of any non Muslim children being insulted by teachers, particularly regarding the way they dressed. Islam was covered extensively in the curriculum but Christianity was never touched on. Known extremists were brought in to speak to the kids. Some school governors have been removed but there are fears it's a lot more widespread as parents have now made hundreds of accusations.   Thats the thing about depression, it wears you dowj and takes away your hope of recovery. I had a really bad reaction to lexapro and refused treatment for a while after that, but most people I speak to say medication eventually helped them once they found the right one. You dont want to live the rest of your life like this so consider leaving all treatment options available, particularly ones that are known to have helped millions of people like meds. All I can think to recommended other than that is a book- Self-Coaching: The Powerful Program to Beat Anxiety and Depression: How to Heal Anxiety and Depression by Joseph J Luciani. I haven't read it personally but a friend of mine did a few months ago and swears by it.  Good luck    We don't have a contract yet  That's really what it comes down to. As far as I can see through what you have written you have no legal protection. What work have you put into the business exactly?   Unfortunately it is looking like you've messed up big time by getting other people involved and still not doing any legal work at all. Technically, the idea isn't yours. He can use it and produce it as his own business, its a shitty move but it happens all the time.  As others have said, threaten to sue. Talk to anyone who could help you put together a legal (or even legal looking) threat about this and generally scare the shit out of him. Tell him that you will ensure any investors are aware of these legal threats.   If possible perhaps you could quickly set up a competitor (I guess you understand the business better than him and coders are easy to find).  	3
 /r/circlejerk   edit: thanks for the gold!!  edit2: im grill ;)   This is the worst assignment we've ever been on      MR. PRESIDENT!   YES! Take that, Bitterman!    I'm no pirate, but if publishers want to be assholes they can get fucked.  Fine by me. Developers think publishers are assholes too. That's they're job - they need to be ruthless in this market. Publishers are business men and marketers. They're not gamers. They don't care if the game is good, as long as it makes money.  The blame often gets shifted to the devs. While sometimes that blame is due, how can a developer make a great game when they're expected to produce Call of Duty # every 12 months?   Basically: go fuck yourself if you are a dick. If not, and you don't make shit overpriced games, I'll give you my support.  Yes exactly. This is what I mean by "vote with your wallet." If you like a developer and like their game, buy it. Otherwise, move on.    I still want to play their games....so....  **TOO.**  **FUCKING.**  **BAD.**  You entitled little shit. It's not water. It's not air. It's not civil rights or freedom of speech. It's not something you get due to your very dignity of being a human being.  **IT'S A FUCKING VIDEO GAME.** It's a luxury the VAST VAST majority of people cannot even afford. Yet you feel you have the GOD-GIVEN RIGHT to PIRATE games, made with sweat, and tears and excessive amount of espresso? Give me a fucking break.  And fuck the twat that upvoted you.

While none of the DLCs are essential to getting the full story, I suggest checking out our sidebar to see which ones are the best.   Don't be a fucking asshole. Only fucking assholes pirate.

Sorry for the number of swears but piracy really pisses me off.   My monitor can go up to 2560x1440   Hey man, used to work at Staples in their tech sales and EasyCare department (where we fix people's computers). Now I work in the games industry.  For that kind of price you're much better off building your own gaming PC. For $900 you can build one hell of a gaming computer with an i5 and 290 or maybe GTX 970. That laptop has an i7 which is completely useless for solely gaming. i7's are designed to take on anything; unless you are doing video editing, 3d modelling or other high-end stuff, just go with a lower-priced i5 that will give you the exact same performance in gaming.  The main thing is the 730M GPU on that. It sucks, plain and simple. Good luck getting a decent framerate from ESO on low.  Another thing is that laptop has 1TB of HDD. While 1TB is a lot, you want to get ESO and Windows running on an SSD for WAY faster boot times. A HDD takes a couple minutes to boot, while an SSD takes about 10 seconds. Laptop manufacturers get away with putting cheap Seagate or Western Digital drives in laptops, as most people think "Wow, 1TB, so big!" When really, you can buy an internal 1TB HDD for around $30.  8GB of RAM is plenty. ESO does not use more than 4-6GB of RAM, even on my 1440p, ultra settings setup. Again, unless you're doing 3D modelling or video editing, 8GB is more than enough. I am a game developer, so I need 16GB in my PC.  The 15.6" screen is going to hurt after a while - you will get back strain and eye strain after looking at something so small. Take it from me, as I used to solely game on an ASUS 17" laptop (which is even bigger than yours). Once I moved to an actual desktop with a 27" 1440p monitor, I can never go back.

It will run ESO at 60FPS, 1080p, max settings very easily. And it's cheaper than your laptop.   If you really need something on-the-go, just buy a cheap tablet on sale to access email and stuff. You're saving money with this build anyways.   What are you talking about? I see a massive drop in quality from errain's screenshots. I run at 2560x1440 and even going down to regular 1080p I see a big drop in image quality.   I am getting very bad lag and frequent disconnects, so it may be server-side thing   Mass Effect, with all DLC. Why? It gets "role-play" the best for a single-player game IMO. You really are Commander Shepard, warts and all. You get angry, happy, sad, depressed and joyful over the three games. The characters you interact with seem real and the stakes of your adventure, high. I have never been so attached to a virtual game character than I have in Mass Effect.   Lunch lady Dorris, have ye got any grease?      Don't touch my stuff!...Hey, this isn't the YMCA.   Homeless man - Mailbox   Mmmm *falls through asphalt hole*....WOW...BART!      I doubt the artists involved wanted to do that, but due to Ubishit's time constraints, they have to push out a new game everywhere. There's only so much you can do in 12 months.  I am in modelling and character design myself; I could not stand to copy+paste a model in a scene, but when you're on a limited time budget, you gotta keep going to get deadlines.   Won't regret that in 60 years   I had not considered that, so fair point.   I had not considered that, so fair point.   confirmed   Or a stupid Shepard who just happens to get things done out of sheer luck. Never lead a team, never put yourself into harms way. When Miranda says "In theory, any biotic could handle it," make her do the biotic barrier. When Jacob volunteers for the vent, let him do it. Always let someone else lead. If you do need to make a choice, make an ill-informed one by tossing a coin.  Or you could play as a xenophobic Shepard. Never recruit aliens if possible. Never do alien loyalty missions, and try to get them killed. Be Paragon to all humans and Renegade to all aliens.   I just finished my complete DLC playthrough two days ago and I know exactly how you feel. I haven't even played any other games since finishing ME3...they all feel so inadequate (they're not, I'm just in post-Reaper melancholy).  It's like finishing a very good book, or television show. You invested so much time into the characters, world and story that you don't want it to end. Then you get sucked back into boring reality.  If you want another dose of glorious escapism, check out Dragon Age!   I am really hoping BioWare goes back to their roots from ME1 - a grand-scale, sci-fi golden age kind of plot. Big ideas, fairly science-based, and megastructures (oh baby, love dem halos and dyson spheres). Instead, it was changed into a modern-day action shooter. The new Star Trek movies, while okay on their own, did the same thing.   Couldn't have said it better myself. Well put.    it ran worse on my PC with everything on medium/low, despite me being able to max Inquisition and maintain 60FPS, though I can sort of forgive it due to its age, this happens a lot with older games.  Sounds like a driver issue. My 970 gives me almost 150 FPS in DAO while I get around 50 in DAI @ 1440p   On board with you enjoying DA2 the most - I was engrossed in both characters and story in DA2 more than DAO. I dislike DAI, so I won't even mention it here.  To me, DA2 felt like it had the most fleshed out characters, each with their own realistic back story. You were this group of ragtag misfits in a city going through sweeping societal changes. On top of your companions, the main plot was unique among gaming - it was the story of a city, a populace, rather than some hero killing everything in sight. It felt like a true epic, a game version of Les Miserables or Tale of Two Cities.   Knight-Commander Meredith was an *awesome* character. Her writing, voice acting, motivations; her entire character was well done. I have yet to meet a more interesting character in Dragon Age.   I can believe DAI has a very high word count, as you have the main plot, the hundreds of quests and then almost 6 hours of party banter on top of that. And that's just voice acting. If we add in Codex entries, quest text and other written stuff...yeah DAI has a lot of writing.  But don't use "lines" when discussing writing. A line is arbitrary, based solely on the format the work is provided in. I have a big churchy-style KJV Bible and a little one for travel, then an even smaller (horizontally) one on my phone. The word count is the same across all 3, but the number of lines changes.   Shamalamalan quality twist   Well since you cannot provide an actual source, i.e. a link or video, I drummed this [infographic](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/BGJpxZ2CQAAd2oN.jpg) up.  It says BI had 20k more *words* than an average novel, not pages. 20,000 pages is absolutely ridiculous, if not inhuman.  In comparison, the King James Bible has just under 2,000 pages with about 788,000 words.   [Some classics are around 50-90k words](https://indefeasible.wordpress.com/2008/05/03/great-novels-and-word-count/), with some longer books being up to 175k. Let's say BI had 200k words. It still cannot beat a monster like Atlas Shrugged or War and Peace.   They can easily drum up new conflicts. Keep in mind the entire series has only been set in the Milky Way. Even Star Wars had an extra-galactic [threat.](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Yuuzhan_Vong)  I hope they expand more on the dark matter and biotic stuff Drew and the ME1 team were going towards.    what keep them from enslaving the galaxy?  If you didn't choose Destroy, get the Reapers to bomb Leviathan out of existence.    I'd prefer a sequel with a smaller scale story. But I trust BioWare.  I am all for the smaller story; I'd love a BioWare game with a very small cast (10 main/supporting characters) that have very fleshed out personalities and histories. Then you throw those characters into a personal, emotionally realistic and trying story for a great character-driven space "drama."   But with the way DAI went, I am semi-pessimistic we'll get another Baldur's Gate clone (big bad, assemble team, do missions, kill bad).    Reapers are powerful, they can prevent every single intra-galactic war just by their very presence. It's easier to include geth/quarians, genophage consequences without having to drastically change the plot than including Reapers as guardians.  You can still get away with the Destroy ending - in lieu of the Reapers, the Council makes the Spectres a post-Reaper peacekeeping force. Or everyone is more happy with the Destroy ending so we don't have intergalactic war.  I think BioWare is going to go where the other games did not, or barely touched upon. There was a ton of background lore on biotics, dark matter and the sort that we never really delved into. I hope we see more of the galaxy since there are *billions and billions* of stars out there. Maybe a visit to the galactic core, or even another galaxy?   Many are saying here that BioWare wrote themselves into a hole with the 3 different endings. I disagree; I think if you managed to import saves into ME4, either through a "Mass Effect Keep" or a direct import system, you can still make a plot that doesn't stray much depending on Green/Red/Blue ending.  Here's how I would do it:  Red: This is easy. Allied races rebuild everything afterward. AIs are offline for a bit, but are eventually repaired as well with more checks and balances (e.g. Asimov's laws).  Blue: Again, easier than Synthesis. Shepard's makes the Reapers move to another reclusive part of the galaxy in order to avoid further hostility (who would want to live near a Reaper?). Everything else is rebuilt, like in Destroy.  Green: Probably the most difficult to write, but it can be done. The actual level of "synthesis" was never fully explained in ME3. Did organics just get nano-like implants, ala Deus Ex? Or is it so extensive, does everyone speak telepathically now as a collective "mind-hive"? If everyone were a demi-god AI/organic hybrid, you might as well make an entirely different game series set in the far, far future. However, if we take the former approach of "less" synthesis, it can still be done. You just cannot center ME4-6's plot around the organics vs. synthetics theme in ME1-3. Make it about something else, where it does not really matter if everyone has these neural implants. Sure AIs can empathize now and organics can interface with computers, but we've seen these tropes before in other sci-fi (e.g. Deus Ex, The Matrix, Neuromancer).  The skill of BioWare's writers will definitely be tested. They will need to get creative, as to differentiate itself from the other 3 games and not upset fans.  We're going into a post-Reaper galaxy; changing political and socioeconomic structures, highly advanced technology, and (hopefully) greater galactic cooperation. I would not be surprised if we saw more expansion on biotic research, or extra-galactic exploration/colonisation. Maybe an extra-galactic threat from Andromeda?  For now, I'm content with my own fanfic ME4 trilogy; a story about a highly advanced "immortal being" playing with human biotic potential in a bid to stop the death of the universe.   Got a source for that Bioshock Infinite thing? That sounds way, way too much.   Dude who just moved here too - been listening to Danny for years but have never gotten the chance to see him live. Would like to go with someone   No.   Clickbait at its worse. Who cares.   Didnt enjoy the story as much. Felt like a big DLC or companion novel instead of a worthy addition to the human-covenant-halo conflict (which is what Halo 1-3 was centered around).   He's been in a bunch of ads and in a major video game trilogy. I'd say he is doing all right compared to your average actor.   Deus Ex , Halo 1-3, and the game I am working on!   DAI is an unoptimized console port on PC. Hopefully BioWare will be more familiar with the engine for ME4.   Homer loves Flanders   He's gaining on us, go faster!   Then we roll him up in a carpet and throw him off a bridge!  You don't get these faces with the new animation :(   Nothing can compare to the imagination of a small boy.   It doesnt matter.   I'll make sure I get a better repost next time   I would have never thought of that.   Son, if somethings too hard to do its not worth doing.   I hope in the next ME we get more realistic romances, rather than this hero worship "pick the flirt option 10x to unlock sex scene" kind of fluff.  Romancing Cassandra in Dragon Age does not give me much confidence that romance will evolve in ME4   How are you finding Warlords?   *I should go.*   I've done every LI except Cortez and Tali. While Liara had the most content and is likely BioWare's canon love interest, Jack felt the least hero worship to me. Even Liara practically throws herself at you in ME1.   doh      What did you guys like so much about Arkham? I was never a huge superhero fan, so even after beating AA, I didn't get the hype. Haven't bothered playing AC yet.   Please put all your screencaps into one album, rather than uploading them all separately.   Dear friends,  I had the privilege to do my first complete DLC-included playthrough over this past Christmas break. Beforehand I've only ever played Mass Effect when I bought it, with or without DLC. I'll spare the details, but I had a very challenging 2014 and was very down in the dumps. 2015 is shaping up to be much better.  I am kicking off my "new year" (7 days later), with the completion of Mass Effect 3. I played a Captain Kirk-like (paragade) man-shep, romanced Liara in ME1 then, for a change, did Jack in 2/3. Jack is an awesome LI, if you have not tried with her already.  Anyways, I finished ME3's final mission tonight after doing the "energetic" Citadel party. After I chose the [green ending](/spoiler), I was still feeling a bit down when the credits rolled (which I played M4 Faunts overtop) and rebooted my save.  I played the entire party again as the quiet version. In my head, [this was heaven for Shepard after he died at the end of Synthesis.](/spoiler) Just kicking back with friends. What a perfect ending to the trilogy with Shep's whispered line "The best..."  Thank you BioWare for keeping me company over the Christmas break, and creating the best game series I've ever played. Here's hoping Mass Effect 4 is even better.   They do have hair physics - watch Morrigan's hair in any conversation and it's quite easy to spot   Because creating realistic hair that moves with the physics engine (Havoc, in DAI's case) is very difficult. Look at Tomb Raider 2013 - they had that special TressFX hair and it still looked really wispy. Even in photorealistic CGI hair still looks off.  What most developers do is put on a heavy layer of post-processing on hair or fur. If you've played Far Cry 3/4 or Lost Planet, it is very evident.   Care to expand? I don't enjoy the combat, as it's spammy, boring and MMO-esque. The animations and effects were pretty, but it's a pain to go through (especially that 3 hour boss fight at the end).   It's not due to consumer interest - it's because your subreddit was linked on /r/games and /r/subredditdrama over fanboy Dominoid's post   I've got about 100 hours in on my Deluxe copy. It was okay the first couple times to 50, but it gets old fast. The lore is a pretty dull affair and I don't remember any of the characters except the green hologram dude.   That's generally the phenomena with most games - the ones online are either disgruntled customers or rabid fanboys. The normal folk just enjoy the game.   They're meaningless, arbitrary awards from a random games website. They can give Dolphin Simulator 2014 best MMO and it doesn't change anything. Who fucking cares.    Then you don't give an award that year, which is exactly what Massively did   When you pay $60+ then 15/month on top, then another $15 to get a fucking mount, you're going to defend a shitty purchase.  Just look at assholes like /u/T-Husky in this very subreddit.  ESO has a notoriously wank fanbase. Far worse than any MMO ive played.   RemindMe! 6 months  Edit as of jan21: hahahahahahahah. Fuckin right.  Edit 2 as of July 2015: ;)   You must be flip. Only flips complain about flips   Report, ignore and move on   Sarcasm?   The best thing in the genre was a mediocre expansion for a decade-old theme park mmo   Reapers got blown up. Relays rebuilt along with EDI. Geth in the process. Shepard survives, but is so distraught over his journey, he buys a small cabin on a far away colony to live in peace. He takes up drinking as a hobby and has severe post-traumatic stress disorder. His LI either died or doesn't know where Shepard went.   Most of the Elder Scrolls games do this fairly well. You may also want to check out Divinity; Original Sin   I don't know - the rest of the game writing is fairly good, as good as any Mass Effect (Citadel is awesome). It's mainly the Cerberus parts I have a problem with. I think it's something to do with games in general - they needed a "human" enemy for the player to kill, rather than just Reaper husks of the various races for 45 hours straight.  It was the same in ME2 - where did all the mercenary groups recruit hundreds and hundreds of brain-dead drones to fight Shepard?    I love the game,  I'm confused; you list several major cons with the game, but love it?   Is it just me or do we overuse "love" in regards to products?   I think KOTOR1 was better; KOTOR2, unless you have a third-party mod, is a buggy mess with a terrible ending.   I got about 75% through DAI, got so bored I started another ME playthrough. Almost done ME3 and haven't even touched DAI since before Christmas  I bought Alpha Protocol and KOTOR1 like yourself, looking forward to them   Other than Hawke's inclusion being fanfic-y, I agree with you on every point.   I think DAI is a boring, MMO-esque grindfest for power level.   But to each their own. Got about 35 hours in, third last mission and haven't touched it since before Christmas.   I am doing my second playthrough of ME3. I forgot how terrible some of the writing and plot holes are, but the biggest one is really glaring.  Why is Cerberus this massive force with unlimited soldiers, when in ME2 they were a small survivalist group? Why is Martin Sheen going on the all-out offensive, when before he used small squad tactics to capture highly valuable material? Why is Cerberus on Tuchanka? Why are they at Grissom Academy? Why are they on Sur'Kesh? Why are they fighting me more than the Reapers?  Don't get me wrong, the game is fun. Outside of Cerberus/TIM/Kai Leng (god he is fucking awful), the writing is fairly good.   If possible, try to use a flatter, wider nose.   Money. I wish they wrote his character better in ME3 too - he's such a [talented](http://static.rogerebert.com/uploads/movie/movie_poster/apocalypse-now-1979/large_xytHTHqtQlXtzyJTtlqnVjvDdqd.jpg) [actor](http://i37.tinypic.com/68g410.jpg), they could have done so much more with him.   An MMO should do one of two things - be honest and blatantly copy World of Warcraft, knowing full well it will never succeed World of Warcraft (WoW) - or create a sandbox where the players create the content (EVE Online). SWTOR, BioWare and EA foolishly thought to take on WoW's throne and they couldn't even make it up the first step before crashing and burning. All they made was WoW, with single-player KOTOR stories and some *okay* (IIRC) 16-player raids. They could have easily just created a Destiny-like game, or something akin to Borderlands; a story-driven game with player choice and some co-op.  BioWare could have easily created KOTOR with some multiplayer elements with the budget put into SWTOR. In fact, SWTOR was so bloody expensive [(estimates at $200mil+)](http://www.gamespot.com/articles/star-wars-the-old-republic-cost-200-million-to-develop/1100-6348959/), they could have made a single-player KOTOR so vast, so epic in scope, it could have been their magnum opus. I think it was EA's interference that spurred the creation of SWTOR; they saw how successful Wrath of the Lich King and Burning Crusade were (the current xpacs at the time of development), and said "wow, people love star wars, let's just use WoW's formula and add Star Wars." Where have we heard that before, just in the last year with another popular single-player franchise?  From a game design and innovation perspective, most MMOs today are drastically outdated. Every single one is just copying Everquest's formula, World of Warcraft included. The only exception I can think of that takes full advantage of the massively-multiplayer environment is EVE Online, where by players run the economy and political structures in the game.   We can argue that most games are built off previous games, as nothing is inherently "original." BioWare has essentially been remaking Baldur's Gate for the past 17 years. But that is what they're good at - creating interesting *character-driven, single-player* experiences. Not MMOs. The MMO genre has been stale since 2004 - the year when WoW released and EVE was celebrating a 1-year anniversary. Unless you enjoy WoW, there is literally nothing else to play that is inherently different except EVE Online. Why would you play SWTOR, or EQ2, or ESO, or Age of Conan? They're all World of Warcraft, with some twists here and there, but they all fail to live up to WoW's amount of content, class balance, lore or player base.    The reversal of the Reapers from this enigmatic, god-like space cthulu machine race into loltripods from War of the Worlds.  ASSUMING DIRECT CONTROL  I KNOW YOU FEEL THIS  BRMMMMMMM  Give me a fucking break.   So Mass Effect Galaxies?   Its got 8 self-contained stories that do not need any help from other players.  Why did they make an MMO again?   Probably wouldn't have Martin Sheen as a voice actor   I can see ESO nurtures a very mature, helpful community. This subreddit was toxic at release and is still shit now. Enjoy your shit game folks - I'll save this post and come back in 6 months when it goes F2P.*  *they removed 6 month sub options. why the fuck would they do this if they were NOT planning on going F2P?

Dam right   Wtf   How can it be anything but [M4 Part II by Faunts?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUKiOcV1SSc)  Halo and Journey have the best soundtracks though   Good luck getting to 120FPS @ 1440p for any recent AAA titles, unless you SLI 970s or something   It's rumored to be going F2P in a few months, so wait.   wtf? Did EA or Ubisoft go down or something? What is this shit, OP?   Now buy a QNIX for WQHD   If they were, they wouldn't still be in business.  blah blah, Ubisoft, blah blah.

 I've used rdio cos we didn't have spotify but now I want to move over to google play cos I think they have bigger payouts to artists.   Country:  Revolution by Miranda Lambert  Home by Dixie Chicks  Randy Rogers Band by Randy Rogers Band  Chief by Eric Church  Metamodern Sounds in Country Music - Sturgill Simpson    Artist/Album  Miranda Lambert - Revolution  Dixie Chicks - Home  Best Coast - Crazy For You  Rilo Kiley - More Adventurous  Randy Rogers Band - Randy Rogers Band   rdio.com, I'm switching to google play though. If I like an album enough I buy it off iTunes. And if I like the artist enough I actually buy the CD.   A friend actually did this. I thought it was insanely crazy/creepy at the time but he's one of those guys that just says "Fuck it" and does whatever he feels is right. He saw me shopping one day on vacation and decided he had to get to know me so while I was standing around he chatted me up. We became instant friends before I went back home. For some reason he became fascinated with where I came from and made the 16 hour drive to my hometown and stayed a week in a tent behind my parents house and got to know my town and my family. He says its one of the best trips he's made. He's actually the first and only person to ever mention how beautiful my dark brown eyes were. Everyone is quick to compliment blue/green/etc but rarely brown so I was pleasantly surprised.   Do women have different protein requirements than men? I took some whey protein powder from my brother in law until I get my own. But my friend tells me I need to go to a professional to find out what exactly protein I need. He mentioned protein shakes made specifically for women?     I liked Kiss Me. Saw it on Netflix. Imagine Me and You is good as well.   Confidence and hobbies. I think looks (either eyes, body, whatever) can draw a person in but it's personality or choices they make that can make them attractive. The most attractive girl I ever met was cute but what made her so hot was that she was very confident, super friendly, ambitious, and she had various hobbies like cross country skiing.   I would probably say Kristen Stewart. I only saw Snow White and the Huntsman just for her.   I feel like my depression comes in waves. I think of it as a cycle in which I go through good periods of productivity and socialization and other times when I think life is completely pointless and why should I even bother getting out of my bed. I kind of get what you mean.   Bride Wars. I kept expecting Kate Hudson and Anne Hathaway to admit they loved each other and get married.   I don't think it's forward or weird at all. I've actually gone a step further and pretty much grabbed one girls hand and wrote my number on it. We were good friends until we moved to different cities.   I love Little Big Town but since they switched producers on their last album and decided to chase hit singles they've been kind of meh to me. I see this as another attention grab by them.   Oh wow, thanks for the song suggestions. I have some listening to do!   I've been thinking about songs like "Wide Open Spaces" and "New Strings" which made me also think of songs like "Long Time Gone" where someone leaves their hometown only to realize how good it was back home. Are there any more songs of leaving home only to miss home and/or coming back?   In a perfect world Miranda Lambert would win every country award.   I hope you told her. I've actually told two of my female crushes how I felt about them. One of them was flattered but straight, and the other was asexual and not interested in starting anything but still remains my friend to this day. I really don't regret telling them.   I keep his toys out so he can play with them whenever he wants so I guess i'll try putting them away so he doesn't get tired of them. Play before mealtime sounds like a good idea. He's not declawed.   It seems that way. I've started to divert his attention by grabbing his lure toy when he starts to become aggressively playful. I just don't want him to think it's okay to try to bite and scratch my arms or legs when he's like this.   LOL don't worry I certainly appreciate him, the many cat scratches on my arm tell the story of me constantly petting and hugging him to the point he would get mad.d   I take him out everyday and play with him at least two times a day but I guess I'll ramp it up.  	21

IGN: test_subject5099    make sure you are not using 1.7.9   As far as I know, this isn't true, what actually happens basically, is if you hit a mob, then hit it twice more, you can 3 shot it, however, if you hit that mob twice, another person must hit it 3 times, because your shots did not hit 3 times in a row to kill it.   Disabling gapples and gheads for this could make it even better :P   Can't forget MotherNature, or the other one off events like the RiddleMaster or other such events :P   Personally I don't even have fun surviving.    and I know that you know this, I'm saying your request isn't really going to be fulfilled, because it's going to be completely overhauled soon anyway :P   if you look at the greeting messages, it is not actually out of beta. Power Juice in its current form will never be out of beta, only the upcoming arcade version will be "out of beta".   I'm sure when the next update comes, and Power Juice is changed to an Arcade game, then it will be available for all, and the server will no longer be in beta.   I've always perceived this rule as: if you are purposely doing something to inhibit anyone's game on purpose, this is bannable, such as putting a roof over someone's head or digging them into the quarry. If it is done as an accident, and they are unaware of the bad their actions cause, I don't think this is bannable. This is my interpretation of the rule, I'm sure others have their own.   there won't be another KGM update, as you can see [here](https://trello.com/c/FPXkf3cW/87-wizard-school-tournament) and [here](https://trello.com/c/Dbgnb2OZ/89-classic-golden-monocle). This is because the entire gamemode is being overhauled, and will be completely different. KGM will no longer have leaderboards or titles, but will instead be transferred to WZT or Wizard School Tournament.   You killed that player before, and he must have suicided at some point, so you were credited with the kill, even as a zombie.   You are mistaken, the one in red is ry1234567 before he changed it to black, the one in the penguin suit is deathbot. What I think is funny is they're not even trying to get the LightBringer, that sword there is Excaliju, Bruce's sword.   and Deathbot    DeathSeekerJT, part of the DeathSeeker lineage, those who can use the silver blade of Orion, one of the most powerful swords ever created, blinding monsters with it's glint. Only one DeathSeeker can live at a time, and for millennia one family held the DeathSeeker title, until their last heir died and Orion keep. JT was sent to find the sword, and in the process of escaping the keep, found the blade could be used in his hand, becoming the DeathSeeker. (Also has Brenna, a bow acclaimed for it's explosive power, not as cool a story as Orion :P)   To take a quote from rob himself, "The masses don't know what they want."    it's been a long time, but i'd love to be in it! :D test_subject5099   This^    Precisely the reason I left that game.   test_subject5099 and YetiiWho92    test_subject5099 and YetiiWho92   3 Thank you :D    Me and Yetii were wondering if you do one of her, could you possibly put both of us in it? If it isn't that much of a hassle. :S I don't mean to sound demanding, I love the art, we were just wondering :P   They do get damage immunity, however, because their death is by a spell, they can be "tagged" by a player, and when they blow up it registers as a kill. This works for all mobs that die a suicide type of death, like Seppukus. so it appears like they have no immunity if you just looked at kill feeds, but they do have it.   ry of the gym beta never forget.   Check Rob's twitter, it's there somewhere.   I won anyway ^^    Salogel is a part of the cats, and we do not participate in such activities. - JT of the Cats   They always tell me to get a room    There's a difference between a real argument, as you explained, and a role play argument, as wolfboy explained.   Void, if you fall in you just get teleported back to spawn.   It's not.      You won't be getting that helmet back.   And for this, they risk getting banned. This is an exploit, and it is bannable. Warn them, or don't, but they can be banned for having two sets.   fixed. Saw some myself, just was took a bit to change it.   The protection is not as intrusive now that the creepers you are shooting don't have invulnerability, and the mobs don't drop right on your head, so it isn't as difficult to not walk into the zone. This area technically is still farther than it was when the protection was first introduced, but less than when Nis moved it back.    No, what it means that you can't throw armor, you can't be rearmored ever. You will always have armor in your inventory, unless it all breaks, so you can't be rearmored. RNG is Random Number Generator, how a lot of games make things random.   As I stated above, I mean the Diamond armor, any piece.   I mean your full set of diamond armor, if you throw it out of your inventory, any piece, it will teleport back into your inventory. Be sure to click around your inventory to find it, and if it doesn't appear, it can take a while to appear.   After several Test games run by Nisovin, a very small update was rolled out to Dogekac and Daragor, plus a removal of a certain mob.  * **Dogekac** was known for having a large amount of **holes in the bedrock** to bypass certain areas, such as at the front of the keep, there being holes under the lights, straight to the Inner Shrine. **These holes are now filled in.** * Speaking of **Inner Shrine**...It **was removed**, there are now two shrines. The Bridge Shrine, and the Final Shrine. * **Daragor's mob spawn was pushed back**, the tools tables were moved slightly over, and many trees were added abouts the front. The **mob protection is slightly forward**, to about **4 or so blocks infront of the shovel table.** * ~~Unless the RNG was being very harsh to the **Spider Kings** in the games I played, they are **removed.**~~  *Saw some in a Dogekac game, JT is wroooooooooooooooooooong.* * **Armor is not throwable anymore**, it will teleport back into your inventory.  ~~This means you CANNOT be rearmored.~~ *Unless, of course, all of your armor breaks.*   * You can now be rearmored if you are missing a piece of your armor, such as a helmet, and it will be re-equipped. No need to drop all your armor anymore. (Thanks Nis!)    My setup:  1. Pot 2. Sword 3. Bow 4. Pot 5. Shield 6. Pick 7. Cobble 8. Glue 9. Torches  The reason I use two pots is because when I played on the UHC reddit, I liked to have pick, sword, bow. So I was never accustom to changing that system and using hotkeys, so I prefer to keep my bow and sword together.    Yes! someone else that uses two potions :D   Oasis is out of the rotation, and has no indication of returning.   Something that I had heard, is that Nohdalag would eventually get flame as an attribute, which doesn't do anything because zombies have fire resistance, but it would look pretty cool. I know this was a planned thing, but never actually put in place.   Another Hero idea I had was the ShepherdofFire, a hero that has the Staff of Hellfire, that creates lanes of flame around its target, just to look cool. He also spawns with 5ish one use items, that are very overpowered, but hurt the dwarves too, such as killing all the monsters at once, but also killing a few dwarves, or giving every dwarf a 30 second proc, but unarmoring half the dwarves too. The Shepherd of Fire may have 10 items that he CAN spawn with, but may only relieve 5 or so, making every Shepherd unique.   DeathSeekerJT: Uses his own bow, Brenna, a one shot bow that causes the explosion animation and if it hits a block, breaks it. He uses Orion, the silver blade, that deals more damage than a runeblade but not as much as Excaliju, and when it procs, produces large amounts of fireworks that blind the monsters (this may or may not work, depending on if it crashes players or not). Orion is passed down by DeathSeeker lineage, and only one that uses the blade, can have that title, and only one DeathSeeker can exist at one time.   That was my idea too D:     This change was today, the 27th, and not yesterday, the 26th.   More balancement changes, and reintroduction of an old map.  * Daragor has been readded, using the multiple shrine system, has 3 shrines: the Gate Shrine, the Juice Shrine, and the Final Shrine, each on a layer of the map. * Armor, when repaired, gives 160 durability per repair, rather than 100 from before. * When dropped, an armor piece ends up in oblivion, and is gone forever. (Remember, if you require a new set, throw away ALL of your old set.) * Mount Willakers' shrines were reduced to two: the Courtyard Shrine behind the front wall, and the Final Shrine. * Each map has a monster spawn debuff/protection, that deals a dwarf nausea and a bit of poison if within the radius. (This has the unfortunate effect of blocking dwarves from the cave on Dogekac, unsure if intentional or not.) The debuff is the same amount of nausea, but the poison starts as a very low amount, and then after about 5 seconds, becomes poison III. * Dogekac's lobby is no longer destructable. * **As of the 27th,** Dogekac's shrines were changed as well, to 3 shrines: Bridge, Inner, Final. **THIS IS SUBJECT TO CHANGE**   Meh, not for me, but personal thoughts I guess   Lost my Pegasus Boots, great day yesterday. :/   The Exact Opposite way JT would be, hooray!   Thing is, I would agree if the walls weren't literally behind the shrine you need to take, so once you get through, you die to the shrine field. Maybe with the new shrine placement they will be more useful, but atm, they aren't that good.   When the pigs fly and we all spawn with Excaliju, only then. :P   Your last point would be extremely cruel, because we just want to play games like anyone else, that's why titles don't have  more powerful weapons (with the exception of the Staff, dealing an extra half heart) so I see no reason why we should be hindered, just because we are titled. There are plenty of people without titles that are better than me, and they wouldn't be hindered. Also, I see no reason to nerf procs, and rob has mentioned before, he will not do any rebalancing until after heroes are reintroduced, but I think procs are fine, in my opinion.  	61

 Nice new meme  I can feel the aura of dankness in this one.    Some girl just put her titties all up in the camera.   Nice.    Nice account name.    yeah, man. It's a real bummer to see that a girl that small was taken advantage of. It's a real hard thing to grow up with, as it can both subconsciously and consciously effect every relationship you have from that point onward. Trust does not become a thing without time and proper help, and anxieties are high.   Some people just really don't think about that too often.    Kinda looks like an everyman, to me.

Translation: I am Groot   Tomorrow on TIL...    I know this is old but I geeked so hard, man. Checking up on this whole Scott Stapp charade after he seems to have fallen out of the new's scope of interest.   Pretty poor article. I feel that it's biased, the writer isn't knowledgeable on the topic, and it's not even spell checked.     I agree with you.  I'm a vaper, and I have no problem with a business banning the use of electronic cigarettes indoors. The only problem is that when state law mandates that no one can use electronic cigarettes indoors, the stores who sell the product will no longer legally be able to offer people to try their products in-store before they buy them. That's the only issue I have with this ordeal. If someone tells me I can't do it in their shop - I will respect that. But if the law prevents vendors from making sales and from users being able to try before they buy, that's a bummer.  The increased taxation is the biggest bummer. Both Illinois and Washington have been fighting bills to prevent 90%+ taxation on not only e-liquids but the actual hardware vaporizers. Electronic cigarettes are not a tobacco product as much as nicotine gum is not a tobacco product. In addition, many people use e-liquid that contains no nicotine - however they will still be mandated to pay that heavy sales tax. It doesn't make sense :(.   It's not just found in pantry items, however. Propylene Glycol, for instance, is used as a solvent for medications. A great example is the medication Dilantin. When applied intravenously, the medication is 40% propylene glycol.    It "stains"  "less".   Not "stainless"    Have you read the terms   conditions?    What are some of your weaknesses?

I've seen quite a few success stories around here and I've been waiting to be able to have one to share.    I really like mine! I don't really like the Infinite CLT v2 I've got on top of it, however, but I'll take what I can get for cheap.      I've too taken Effexor - it's a hell of a drug!  I often think I should end things with him simply to spare him from me.  I don't recommend this. Once you've completed tapering and it's out of your system, you may regret that decision and it may be irreparable. Consider this: Maybe he's not tiring of you, and those thoughts only stem from insecurities that the tapering might have quite a bit of an effect on. Maybe you go to end it to spare him, but he was never tiring of you at all.  I'd say to let him decide to end it if he decides he's tiring of you - however I don't think that anyone worth having in your life will tire of you due to your depression.   Here's a long but funny anxiety narrative.   Although I used to go from relationship to relationship and get used here and cheated on there, the failure of my last relationship (and my longest at about a year and a half) motivated me to take some time to be alone and become more independent. I put up a wall around my heart, and I learned how to be comfortable by myself while working to mend my anxiety and depression both on my own and with some professional help. However, I've recently met this girl who I think I'm ready to chase after.  In my college math course, there is this girl who sits two tables in front of me - out of sociable range - and she is just stunningly gorgeous. However I spent weeks of class just stealing glances at her not knowing how to start up conversation. I realized that she started to worm her way into my mind quite a bit even outside of class. My buddy who sits next to me in class (who probably became annoyed with me talking about her so much) kept pushing me to just approach her and get her number, but those with anxiety know that you have to wait for the perfect timing - even if it doesn't ever come.  However on Thursday, I noticed that she began to start turning around quite a bit more to glance at me during class as well. After that, I noticed that she overheard a joke I made, laughed at it, and turned around to add on to the joke, and we both laughed together.   At the end of the class that day, we were working on an impossible group quiz. Me and my buddy were still working on it way past the end of class, as was she with her 6 person group. I didn't think by any means that I would have figured out the answer to the question the whole class was stuck on, but I managed to, and got up to turn my quiz in and dip out for the day - however, I first stopped over by her group to see if they wanted to copy my answers.   She was immediately thankful, as was the whole group, however she then told me that I was, "like the nicest person ever." At that point she got up out of her chair and looked me right in the eyes. The connection was overwhelming. Then, when she spoke to me, my mind made an awful twist of her words - as we were making eye contact, she said, "Can I fuck you?"  My mind went completely blank. My anxiety soared into hyperdrive, and I had entered complete autopilot. I don't even know if I said anything - I most likely just gave her a blank stare. My mind was fighting with my ears trying to replay the words back in my head while a monkey was clashing two cymbals together and I was not good at multi-tasking between the two thought processes.  Then, she came towards me and just wrapped her arms around me, as I wrapped mine around her. Over a span of just a few moments I went from having no contact and being trapped in my own obsessions, to looking each other in the eyes and having a heartfelt connection that happened out of nowhere.  The words she said were, "Can I hug you?" Thank god I didn't have to bend her over on the table in front of all of these people.  She introduced herself, as did I, and I told her that it was really nice to have met her. I think the monkey clashing cymbals really took over at that point because I can't remember whether or not I even acknowledged her presence after that point or what happened next, but I was completely overwhelmed with happiness. My heart didn't stop racing for the next hour, and me and my buddy exchanged high fives and jokes both about the misheard words and about how I managed to swoon the poon with my math skills.   I've decided that when my children ask me how to get chicks, I'll tell them that they've just gotta find the zero of that polynomial. Gotta get the maths to get the girls.  I'll update this in the future, however now that the ice has been broken in a non-awkward way, I'll be getting her number as soon as I get back from spring break. I've got a really great feeling about this one, and I'm pretty sure some day soon this beautiful girl will be mine :)  For any of those in a similar situation who are guided by music, check out [this song](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iErjaKTX_3w).

 I'm having a hard time believing it does. I've been diagnosed with depression, this past April but I've been living with it since 2008( when I started high school). It got worse once my mother died and when my closest friends and I went our separate ways once we graduated high school. There are a lot of other factors that's causing my depression( being attracted to women, wishing I was born a man, wishing I wasn't black, never being intimate with someone) which has caused me to gain so much weight. Since I graduated from my trade school, last month, I tried to start working out, but stop because of a terrible pain in my lower back and left leg. That really messed with my head. I want to get better, but it's like my body doesn't want me to. My anxiety prevents me from going outside. I feel very ashamed to be seen outside. I live in Germany with my dad( we're American). I don't want to be seen by people because I always get stared at, it makes me feel worse about myself. I know Europeans(or anyone, really) don't like fat people, so I hate myself so much for what I am. I want to get better, get in shape, but I feel so hopeless. All my friends are married, having children, and here I am, the loneliest I've ever been in my life. I don't know if I can make it, any longer.   Thank you for this. I've been trying to motivate myself to get into shape, but I'm not sure what I should do first. Like, what do I eat? Will I even have time to prepare meals, everyday? If I go to the gym ,how do I know, no one's going to take photos of me and post them on some place like reddit, to mock me? I see that happening a lot. It really terrifies me :/  It causes me so much anxiety.   And I appreciate your honesty :)    I've been curious about this. I worry that I'm automatically nixed when it comes to dating. Now granted, I've never been in a relationship, before, let alone dated anyone, before. This sounds really silly, but stuff like this, and other horrible things I've read on reddit, (i.e r/fatpeoplehate or r/talesoffathate. Yes, I'm not in shape, and I know people are certainly not attracted to overweight folks) has definitely effected my self esteem.  I'm just curious to know what you guys think.    Yeah :( But thank you!!! :D   Thank you, so much! I really appreciate it!!   	6
 I didnt like him in anime, but when i read the manga i took liking of him, he went trough so much development imho.   I m really intrested how long will this thing last.   yeah It was very creative in its own way, would like to meet person who came up with this   Ok Im not qualified to be saying this but you should probably visit psychologist, but dont let them watch it if you want to stay out of assylum    this anime is not only shit, its also about shit and other stuff^ohh^the^memories^comin^back    something like  Bondage Game: Unlimited Bondage Works ?   fair point    well I actualy kinda enjoyed it, made me laugh few times^^I^^HAVE^^NORMAL^^SENSE^^OF^^HUMOUR   Can it be hentai ?

 I love that video! Bookmarked it to save for a rainy day. :)   I have been doing Actives C25k program and am now on week 7. For about ten days now I have been telling myself that I don't have time for running. Or maybe I'm a little sick. Or that I deserve to take it easy right now since I have a lot at work. No training for ten days and no food logging for the first five of those.   This is usually the beginning of the end for me. I start skipping some workouts and soon I just tell myself that it didn't work this time either. That I'm destined to always fail. Why even bother?   This time I just said no. No, I'm not quitting. So I had some bad days? So what? I am not someone who quits. I went out today and did w7d2 and told myself the entire run that this is not me starting over, this is me just continuing. This is what I do now. It's not some temporary thing that I can quit whenever I feel like it. Because I'm not someone who quits.   If I need a few days of for whatever reasons that is okay. But that is not me quitting. I promise myself that I will always continue as long as my body is capable. I'm no longer someone who quits.   I'm doing C25K for the first time. Today I did week 6 day 2 and then went home and got my four year old. We were watching her father run a local 10k race this friday and she wanted to try.   I asked her where she wanted to run and she choose a nearby playground. She could probably beat me both in speed and stamina in the long run if she wanted to but I was a little bit worried that she was going to be bored quickly. We started jogging and she soon learned to match my pace. After a slow five minute jog we were at the playground. We did some easy exercises and raced each other over the field. [Lisa showing me how to run sideways.](http://i.imgur.com/XFYhiBW.jpg)  Then she wanted to ["rest"](http://i.imgur.com/oNO2urH.jpg) for a while. After that we did some [bodyweight exercises](http://i.imgur.com/OMGZy9W.jpg) (or as she thought, more resting). Then we did a slow jog home with some walking and sprinting.   We were out for maybe 20 minutes. A really fun way of ending your own workout and involving your kids in it. She loved it. It was fun and playful but at the same time a real workout for both of us. I can really recommend it if you have kids!   Working out is not always about performance, sometime it's just about moving your body and having fun. I really hope my kids will grow up remembering that and continue to have fun being active.    Remember that moment and use it when things get tough. That is what true happiness feels like. Thank you for sharing some of it with us!   I'm not the kind of person to post updates of all my workouts on Facebook. I don't want my struggle with my weight to be public and for everyone close to me to have an opinion on what I should eat and do. But this feels different. We're all in this together and I know that there are other people like me here. Every single comment I have received have been helpful and supportive. I don't feel alone in this anymore.   	5
 It was my friend's, hopefully they understand it died for a just cause.   Yeah, I didn't think so aha   Does the rice really work that well?   Currently I don't have a choice, but I really didn't foresee something like this happening   Can't say I wouldn't react the same way aha Gives me more confidence that my machine will come out unscathed   Okay, just performed this test and the fan doth spin.   What will this test do exactly?   I had serious issues with temps before but as soon as I moved down there I never went above approx. 30   Aha Yeah, I noticed that after I got a new CPU cooler but I never changed it since the basement keeps my PC super cool regardless.   If it was on, what's a possibility of the damage this would've cause? I wasn't home when it happened but my friend said he unhooked everything and took it out. If it was on and got unhooked do you think there would be any irreparable damage caused that way?   Luckily I have an extra PSU. I'm not sure it got water in it at all though, there was a Playstation sitting on top of it at the time and that was blocking the top fans. Plus, the GPU is monstrous and completely covers the PSU when sitting upright. I opened it up and only saw tiny tiny water droplets on the motherboard and a bit of moisture on the GPU. It just happened a bit ago and the PC was the first thing we took out.      I'm a movie lover, a gamer, etc. It's what I enjoy. Not a waste if it's something you love.      Absolutely agree.   I am so sorry.   It's such a dramatic way to start your day. It really feels like an epic beginning, like you're watching color flood the world.   I would purchase your room.  	18
 Kyle or Chad. I've never met anyone named Kyle or Chad who wasn't a douchebag   I think that this happened to show that despite the attributes I described he's still a human, and humans fuck up.    I actually respect Frank a great deal. He does what the fuck he wants and gets what he wants despite all obstacles. This doesn't change the fact that he's an awful human being though. I think that one thing the show does really well is showing that despite him being an awful person we all want to be like Frank, at least a little bit. Everyone wants to be strong willed, intelligent, cunning, clever and ambitious. But everyone also wants to be a good person, unlike Frank. Frank doesn't give a fuck.  	3
 Yes i had the same idea to have trouble while passing by in earth dawn the gate spell had a strong spirit guarding it that was better to run by then defeat the same could apply to this but things that you run into while reaching your destination.  I mean shape change as in metagamic kind of thing shapeshift into a sentient puddle or turn your fist intl solid metal and stuff of thr like the same i have thougbt about the character loosing his sense of identity nothing like trying to change sex and critical glitch i would maybe make it so when you glitch either the spell warps or you are stuck with what you tried to change into for a while even alien hand syndrome if applicable. I'm typing all of this on my phone so sorry for the grammar.   I thought about that maybe if the character was an older infected that took his training seriously would have to train for how many mny years i know harlequin did but when it comes to immortal elves well...im not that well versed on them snd people tell me to just ignor that   For Teleport i had the idea for the mage to shift to astral space and get materialize in another place maybe available at high initiation maybe 7-9?  Shapshifting also more than shapechange i'm talking body parts and such.  and finally phasing turn etheral for a moment just dematerializing like a spirit would.  post how would you make them not broken.   spells that you created and found it really useful.   Well apart from the fluff and character  I see most people that understand a bit about min-maxing actually go for mages  what i feel is that they try to make magic so balanced it looses the element of "magic" of it.  and i think that's a debate that's going for a long time chrome vs mana  which i am not the person to answer it but this thread would be enlightning   As a magic character what was the biggest magical feat you have performed and how did it turn out?   Thanks i missed that.   Assuming that they keep feeding regularly. since vampires of old were considered ageless if they kept feeding. didn't find anything on that.   Heavily magic character lacking in alot of other things to boost magic and might be infected with hmhvv while also being very frail so i thought of elric and though that stormbringer would be a nice addition and perhaps be a possible plot point for the gm   Am is readind this right? A mage that follows a tradition wich dosent have water spirits cannot summon such a type? What a bummer what about shedim and such i know some mages can summon them or did i misread that too?  	10
 Is it a pocket door that slides into the wall? I have the same lock on a door like that in my bathroom.   And that reason was...?   Now who is reading too much into something? All I stated was that there a different cultural norms for military people and antimilitary people and between straight people and gay people, for gay people who are involved in gay culture. I never called you violent. You seem to have your jimmies rustled about this. I'll let you go, but maybe chill out and bother to read.  Edit: if you're offended that I saw your post history, stop commenting completely. Its public.   A quick glance through your history shows that you are a straight Navy wife. I'm an anti-military lesbian. Totally different cultural norms there.   I'm saying that I feel downtowns were justified for unnecessary violent feelings. I also feel that you aren't the Reddit police and people are free to downvote even if you disagree with them.   That user implied that it was problematic. A lot of users here left twox in favor of this sub as well.   I personally think it's rude and wrong to desire to burn the faces of people who are concerned for you, but I guess cultural differences and all that.   He's being downvoted for desiring violence over someone showing concern.   Well it's bullshit to compare sister people, so yeah.   But social media like Reddit is different?   Blowjobs.   What if I told you adults can feel guilty about their choices?   I got you. I also can't stand Josh from work. He's just awful.      A mother? A sister? A friend? I have asked my dad, brother, and male friends to help in menstruation situations before.   I love U by Kotex. Periods suck. At least with their line I get pretty packaging and products and it really helps destigmatize something that shouldn't be stigmatized at all. It's surprisingly less embarrassing to whip out a bright purple tampon package than the awkward white one's of other brands.   I'm not trying to hurt feelings, but if saying "present" or "here" first really scares you, please see a doctor. It could be anxiety or even hypoglycemia. Your body does weird things and that's a bit excessive. Please seek help.   It actually just takes a quick trip to the SSA nearest you and then wait for your licence for when It gets renewed.    I hate hyphenated names but don't care if a man takes his lady's name. I just find it unnecessarily long winded and more difficult to spell. Also, if it becomes like a family thing to hyphenate then you have great grand children with like 50 letters in their last name. Try writing that at age 5! That's why my wife and I didn't hyphenate but it doesn't really affect me if other people do.   Edit: when we went for our marriage licence it was also explained to us that getting Social Security when you are old can be difficult with a hyphen and that paperwork gets weird. They suggested that we either pick one name or each keep our own.   When my wife and I got married her mom flipped shit that she wasn't hyphenating. You can't please anyone.   It was just a joke. There are only two or three instances of males with Down syndrome fathering children in recorded history.    Down syndrome.   That's why bars close at 2. To get you home and in bed before shit starts.  Source: pulled out of my ass.   Super shitty quick MS Paint  FTFY     I got banned from feminism for no reason. They wouldn't even tell me why. I'm actually a feminist.   I'm not stigmatizing adoption. I have two adopted siblings and will soon be an adopted parent. Young children understand that sometimes parents stretch the truth and tell lies to make people feel good. If one of their siblings is given away, they will certainly fear it for themselves and it will cause a powerful distrust of their parents. The other child will also have self esteem issues once they find out.   Dude. How would he explain adoption to his kids? Mommy gets huge but this baby isn't worth keeping? It would scare them into thinking they were next. When the kid grew up and all but inevitably found out, they'd also be fucked up that they, the third kid of happily married parents, wasn't worth keeping. That's really not a workable option.   Don't come up these stairs! I wish I had a step right here right now I'd step all over it!   I have a 20 year old self. It's also trash and toys    So we should also lock children up? They flail and could hurt someone, especially another kid or a baby. Most mentally ill people are not and do not need to be hospitalized. Do some research and have some compassion.   Not conforming to them doesn't mean they don't exist. I don't conform to American military worship, that doesn't make me not an American.   If you haven't used it, maybe you guys could trade!   You can't really not believe in them. It's not Santa; your belief isn't required. A telephone pole is also a societal construct but it's still real. Same goes for traffic laws. Disliking it doesn't make it not exist.   So at least approximately 20+ years. Possibly longer as many Republicans and Democrats don't want Hillary and would fight her being on the currency, and she is the only person with potential to be a female president at this time. Why should a female have to do more than Benjamin Franklin or Alexander Hamilton to be on there? It hurts no one to switch it to her over Jackson.   Still a good excuse to eat ice cream and wine for every meal.   About the hair thing. I was never allowed to cut mine. I chopped almost all of it off at about 16 and had it buzzed by 18. Once it's off she can't do anything, and it's not like hair places card. Go to a Wal-Mart or something with a specific pic and specify that you do not want it feminized.   Soooooo many servers walk away as soon as the first extra is requested. I will send you on all 274626 trips I need if you can't wait half a second for me to finish talking.   Monica wasn't Bill's first time straying. I'm willing to bet it wasn't his last, either.   Though, in the 90s and even now, it wouldn't be acceptable politically.   Dollar coins are useless. No where to put them in a drawer and too easily confused with quarters. What you are saying is that women shouldn't be mainstream the same as men in regards to currency. Why can't or shouldn't we update the money to include other, female, historical figures?   I speculate that she doesn't care that he's a cheater. It's the modern world; divorce is okay. They have strength in each other politically though, and they both have their girlfriends on the side, so no one is upset, except Monica and whiny people.          "Because rich people have a drug problem; a cocaine problem. Poor people are lowly addicts; crackheads and tweakers." - my college sociology professor.   I'm a Social Work major. I was commenting on the typical Reddit circlejerk about STEM degrees.   There is a huge variety between penis and clitoral sizes. That doesn't change a persons sex or gender, that was my point.   Why is consistency so important?    Why? They are there to see as well. They also are genetic females, not genetic women. Some people not passing doesn't mean that no people pass. Actually, a vast majority of transmen pass with ease.   The problem is that it isn't a STEM degree. Those are the only degrees worth getting, you know.   I should have said that your gender directly relates to your gender presentation, which is how you are viewed. Sex also isn't consistent. There are intersex people. Where is the line between macroclitoris and micropenis? No two vulvas look the same, so are not all vulvas female vulvas?   You can't use a unisex toilet? Are you sure you aren't the one with a disorder?   People without penises can use urinals. There are stand-to-pee devices and things like Go-Girls. Some vulva having people can also per standing and aim well, though that is rare. Women are allowed to see urinals as well. It isn't against the rules.   Do you tell strangers your blood type? Do you tell them that you are a carrier for Tay-Sachs or any other genetic disorder? No, you don't, and you don't have to announce your sex by walking into a gendered bathroom.   Gender is what other people see. It's how you are socially categorized.   So why do we have to remove the urinal? Women can see them you know.   No you treat them with hormones, just like you do transpeople. The only proven, effective treatment for transpeople is transition.   Not really. It's no one besides you, your partner, and your doctor's business what your sex is. It doesn't matter for your employer or for a bathroom. What matters there is your gender. Gender is hardwired into the brain and has nothing to do with stereotypes. Plenty of transpeople are gay and behave in a role closer to their assigned sex. Many cisgender people are butch lesbians or feminine gay men, but that has nothing to do with their gender.   Close. Gender roles are a social construct. Gender is hardwired into the brain.   An "SJW" degree is a degree in Social Work. It's a very marketable degree.   Sex is in your pants, orientation is in your heart, gender is in your head.      Yeah! Him and his personal vendetta against rain barrels!   Literally only useful for babies. Even if the baby isn't yours, it's content to sleep on them.    Doesn't help.    Vaginal.   They just shove their fingers in. It's deaf privilege.   Thanks for the assumption and shitty source! I've actually only had one partner and she's a woman.   To fertilize the egg the partner has to be recent, as in within the week.   Well. I think you need to go circlejerk back on TRP.   I have a younger brother. I am more than willing to share, but keep your damn hands off my food unless I okay it. I've recently observed that youngest children lack sharing issues like that but they also lack the respect of keeping their hands off other people's stuff. Obviously not all youngest children, but many in my experience.   What is your preference for yourself? Partners? Is it a deal breaker or are you flexible? Any particular reason? Awkward conversation stories?   She's also judgemental if it wasn't clear from this. She posts in FPH.   No death threats were made here.   I hang out with my mom a lot. It's good because I love being close to her, but it's hard. She's almost 60 and has a lot of medical problems. It means that my best friend is dying and it's terrifying. I also spend a lot of time with my wife.    Whynonynonym!   And she'll have a great physical memento of her youth! Pretty cool, huh? It's almost like no one gets sexier between 60 and 80!   One pic had them kissing. It's pretty easy to trip and fall onto that conclusion. No jumping required.   I'm sorry. I worded that poorly. I have two adopted brothers. I'm extremely grateful for biomoms who give up their kids so they can have a good life. I don't believe they are bad people or anything like that. I meant that, on a subconscious level, you may feel that she didn't love you and it may make it harder for you to trust her. Obviously she loved you or she wouldn't have had the courage to give you up to your family.   You trust your parents to love you no matter what. She already, to some degree on a subconscious level, betrayed that by giving you up and you don't have that trust. That's probably why you are scared.   She wants to meet you. The real you. She has no rights to expectations on who or what you are. You want to meet the real her. For this relationship to work, you have to learn to appreciate one another, warts and all.    I don't even have a dick and that sounds great.   And literally anyone over age 7 can do it, physically speaking. A mother or father is no longer needed.   I can read music and I can read tab but I struggle to read chords and it would be much easier for me to be able to play from tab, but I can only really find chord charts online. Am I not going to the right places or is it not typically done to write ukulele tab?   If charted my high school GSA and I was president for two years. Plan lessons ahead. Don't expect to be able to so it on the fly. GLSEN and GSA Network both helped me greatly. Feel free to message me with any and all questions you may have.   Oh god. I'm 20 and this is me. I didn't realize I was so freaking weird.   n   Yes, it is. Everyone uses community resources and the resources are community funded.   Crazy cat ladies defy gender gaps.   It's a slow progression and doesn't require hardcore focus. It's so good! You can pick up anywhere and within three minutes know what's going on.   The store got the money to give them away from somewhere. That somewhere is other customer purchases.    That's exactly what happens! The samples are free to you because the other customers pay for it by buying from the company.    That's still free. He didn't pay for it; it was free to him. That's like saying free samples aren't free because the company paid for it.   Back them up. Accidents happen and technology glitches.   My wife's grandmother and aunts and uncles are all Witnesses on her dad's side. They are so sweet. I absolutely love being around them. Maybe they don't preach since we are gay.   Why ask questions if you don't actually want an answer? Go back to neckbearding over on r/atheism if you aren't capable of discussion.   Disclaimer: this is my personal experience and it certainly varies by person and location.  The only reason a person who makes too much for SNAP to have an empty refrigerator is wasteful spending. My wife and I finally broke down and applied and were called that day because we qualified for expedited food stamps to the tune of 300 just for the two of us. We had no idea we were that poor. Prior to this, we were still eating every day. It was pasta and shitty sauce, but It was food. I do taxes for my family. Last year, my parents made 25,000. My mom hasn't applied for SNAP, though I can't figure out why, but no one goes hungry of them, my brother, his girlfriend, and what they do to supplement my wife and I now that we moved back in with them. It's about budgeting, which everyone has to do. When I was receiving SNAP, if we wanted to eat something besides pasta, we had to work to stretch that money. Yes, the day we got it, we had a full fridge, but the day before we had almost nothing.    I feel like Mux is awful. It's like muck and it makes me think of the phrase "[he] mucks everything up." That's just me, though, so if that's the word, that's the word.   Maybe God wanted them to wait longer and had them need to use IVF and it was God's will that IVF and the doctors existed all along.    Try to find an LCSW. (Licenced Clinical Social Worker) I believe in some places they can do both. Check for your area.   To be fair, the surgery and IVF aren't fool proof, they still fail. They are probably thanking God that it worked.   Edit: I'm not saying they got pregnant because of God. I'm saying that people who thank God are thankful that He allowed the procedures to work.   The thing is, people aren't thanking God for swooping in and saving them. They are thanking God for putting the right people (you) in the right places at the right times and them saving them. They believe that God gave you the gifts of desire and ability to help them. The belief is not that you were there by your own volition, but by appointment from God. Helpers are viewed as special in the eye of God to people who thank God for things like this, surviving surgery, someone showing up to help change a flat, etc. It isn't meant as a slight against you.   Plot twist; the nanny is named Mary and her Nick name is now mama.   I found that helmet on clearance at Wal-Mart and forced it onto my massive head for a selfie. I wish I bought it.   You can't have open containers of alcohol in your vehicle. It's a danger to other people. Your friends broke the law, despite how you feel about that law, and they deserved to be punished. They knew the potential consequences.   For having it in their cars they should be. You don't sit in your driveway and get high. That's like being missed about probation for empty beer bottles in your car.   That is clever!   I've heard it's Mixter.      So you, too, are a proud recipient of the "Is that a boy or a girl?" face from strangers.   You had good points up to society going gluten free. Please outline these benefits.   Is whatever electronics row whatever you own really worth more than a life? Just call the police and press charges if you're that upset.    You must be new here.   Why just the sperm? I, as a sperm, also picked the best egg.   How is it a fact? Who gets to decide how many partners is a whore?   It is true, though, and going back into the closet is scarier than being forced out in the first place. Are you LGBT?   I have a rabbit named Martin.   Heartbreaking, but fantastic. I'm a 20 year old lesbian, so I'm too young to have been there and really understood the situation. I learned so much from that film.   Not at all. People with AIDS are living full or near full life spans. We are just this side of a cure. A vast majority of people with it also try very hard not  to spread it around. They also don't die alone.  Edit: you might he talking about when AIDS first started. If so, I'm sorry, then you are correct other than the fact that 10 years is exceptionally long.    There was also the name Gay Cancer. If you are interested to learn more, watch The Normal Heart.   My wife has PCOS and we've never used protection. I'm not too worried though since we're gay.   Yeah, I don't want my mom or wife to have to identify me all fucked up. At least if I didn't skid the pavement with my face they don't have to see that.   Good on your for apologizing dude!   Plenty of women like anal though    Don't let it. It's a chance to grow and change. You never know, you could end up back together. My father in law remarried his second wife two years ago, after 12 years of divorce. My uncle left a horrible woman and his second wife is his soul mate. Try to be happy at changes. When they say days drag and years fly it's because the days are all the same. Let the change surround you and let it motivate you, if you can. Continue to seek support where you see fit. A divorce is a huge undertaking. Don't be afraid to talk about it. Best wishes.   She sounds like a gem. I picture this baby chub little sweetie with cute Brown hair and squint eyes farthing up the tub lol.       /r/hotelcalifornia   No foul. You made a mistake and owned up. That makes you good in my book.   If he were okay with his height, this would not be a slight worth running to a hotel and drinking.   Grandma, calm down, work boots are in style, I'm sure the "thugs" took them.   I doubt that. You still have to meet with caseworkers, you still have to have a place for people without online access. They help with translations, hold hearings for disputes on welfare and provide phones for calling caseworkers if you don't have one. I don't live in Maryland, but I doubt it's much different elsewhere.  Source: had food stamps, have Medicaid.   That's fine with me. Being normal isn't a crime.   My wife packs Baby, my stuffed doll, when we go on vacation. I always appreciate It but I'm always scared she'll get lost or hurt.   My wife calls them raspberries. I have tried to explain that that action is a zerbert and that a raspberry is when you stick your tongue out and blow.   Writing that one down to try on my wife.   I figure a smile is extremely popular and I think ponies are cute, so that's what I went with.   Axe Anarchy smells like Apple pie!   No I'm trying to play America's Next Top Emojii with you. Those are my nominations.      I'm not Reddit as a whole, and you are pretty far into a comment train to be greeting very many people.  	136
 I have the same problem with DA:O - I create a new save and I'm all like "this time I'll totally be with Leliana or Morrigan!" And then instead Alistair falls in love with me because I can't not find him cute.    That's really clever (and also super adorable).   That I will agree with. Most of the time rape "jokes" are just sexism or other such nastiness disguised as humor. And even though you should be able to joke about anything, that doesn't mean that if you don't handle certain subjects with sensitivity no one will call you out for being an asshole.   Wow, that's really ambitious for a first knitting project! Most people I know (myself included) did something really simple like a basic scarf or washcloth. A whole blanket is pretty difficult. But it looks really good!   I would say that you can make jokes about rape or sexual assault which can be funny, as long as they're not encouraging sexist ideas or blaming victims or any of that nonsense. For instance, Wanda Sykes did a pretty funny routine about having a [detachable pussy](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t rct=j q= esrc=s source=web cd=1 cad=rja uact=8 ved=0CCsQtwIwAA url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DJv5pjSRSLGQ ei=pK5NU46fJMOhyATMp4LgDg usg=AFQjCNEL8ux845yL89JRK5UGUmXXFRdkwQ sig2=f8viZ9fhz-TyifeqIeXKkA bvm=bv.64764171,d.aWw). She's joking about rape, but not in a nasty way; rather she's using humor to deal with an unfortunate situation.   Yeah, now that I think about it pretending to be jealous about Sansa because that's how a girlfriend would react or even being actually jealous because she's worried that she could lose her sugar daddy is definitely a possibility. But turning down the diamonds seems like the exact opposite of that.  Also, with Shae refusing Tyrion's gifts that sets her apart from other whores, as if she is the real deal, his girlfriend who just happened to be a whore - unlike, for instance, the story about the whore who became their grandfather's(?) mistress and started getting uppity about it until they stripped her naked and marched her around Lannisport. But if she betrayed Tyrion for money rather than jealousy Shae is also more in line with this theme.   You might want to consider going to /r/polyamory or /r/nonmonogamy and asking them for advice, if you want to pursue an open relationship.  Also, I would say that you should probably take some time to really sit down with your boyfriend and have some honest discussion about what it is the both of you want. If he's lacking confidence, perhaps there is some way you could reassure or encourage him to try rougher sex. Otherwise, you can talk more about the possibility of an open relationship. Whatever you decide, good luck and I hope things improve for you both.   I'm so sorry this has happened to you, and I just wanted to say you're not alone and your family is being shitty.  For a good portion of my childhood I was physically abused by my brother, and my stepfather chose to ignore this. Even now, my stepdad's family constantly tries to guilt trip me over how I need to be a better sister and they don't understand why I finally got fed up and cut my stepdad out of my life. But I just couldn't tolerate having every conversation with him turn into "you're a horrible sister and you need to treat your brother better" despite the fact that my brother left me with PTSD. Nothing about this situation is okay. And nothing about your situation is okay.  No matter what your family says, you shouldn't have to forgive your father or even be nice to your father if you don't want to. What's most important is your safety. I'll never forget the first time I heard someone say those words to me - "if you don't feel safe around your brother, you shouldn't have to be around him." It wasn't until I was 18 and in family therapy that I was finally told this, and I remember finally feeling validated. It's so awful when practically everyone around you is telling you you're wrong for not wanting to be nice to or hang around the person who hurt you. If you don't feel safe around your dad, you shouldn't have to be around him. If you aren't ready to forgive your dad, you shouldn't have to. It's not about hurting your parents on purpose. If their feelings are hurt, it's not your fault - it's theirs for causing this to happen in the first place and then refusing to amend the problem. So don't give in to their pressure, because you have done nothing wrong.   Especially if it's for an animal, because they won't even get the benefit of placebo effect.   Like the doctor in Germany that tried to tell cancer patients they should give up chemo and take vitamins?   Also, checking an animal's teeth is one of the easiest ways to see if it's generally healthy - if its teeth look nasty or there are a lot missing you know it hasn't been taken care of really well, and the previous owner is giving you a bad gift.   I kinda wish they hadn't gone that route, though. You still got some of it in the books, but it seems like the show is placing a lot more emphasis on "Shae betrays Tyrion out of jealousy." In the books, though, I like to think it was all about money from the get-go. Like the scene with Littlefinger talking about how a good whore will make a man think that she is enjoying herself despite her expectations, I feel like book-Shae was just making Tyrion think that she fell in love with him despite herself but wanted his money and status the whole time.  Also, I think that this motivation is more in line with Tyrion's motivation; its basically the inverse of his first marriage. It makes his rage a lot more justifiable if he wasn't merely betrayed, but felt like he was lied to from the beginning. Finding out that Shae betrayed him out of jealousy would put at least some of the blame on him for not properly maintaining their relationship - it was a problem he could have potentially amended. But if she never loved him to begin with, it is yet another example of how the universe has fucked him over and he never had a chance because he's a dwarf. And that seems to be the recurring theme with all of his issues - I can't get anyone to love me because all they see is a dwarf.   Actually, this is why I usually prefer fan translations to official ones - often times the fans will deliberately put in translation notes that will explain puns and references and whatnot that the official english won't always do. Of course there are still a lot of official translations that are really good, but there is always some cultural context lost whenever you are translating so usually you get a more nuanced view of the work if you read/watch/etc. in the original language and you are very familiar with the language.   Chaos Life is such a good comic.   The whole virginity contest thing made me equally go "gross, those guys are awful" and "shit, this actually happens in real life and that hits a little too close to home."   No, I haven't seen it yet. I don't have HBO, but a friend of mine does, so as soon as I can get together with them I'll be watching it.   Yeah, I was actually really shocked at how well he does some of the characters. I'm willing to bet he probably does some sort of research or talks to people about this sort of thing.   Yes, and no. I was more like Arya when I was younger, maybe - I would stubbornly refuse to be put into a box. But Arya also doesn't face the same pressures that Brienne does because she's still a young girl. It's not uncommon for younger girls to be given more leeway in defining gender norms because they're still children. Once they grow up, though, if they continue to defy those same gender norms they're treated more like Brienne is. After all, half the time Arya is mistaken for a boy so no one questions her behavior. Brienne doesn't have that luxury; pretty much everyone is aware that she is female and they vilify her constantly for not behaving in a way that is more aligned with the female role in her society. By now Brienne is supposed to be married and bearing children so that she can assure her family's political ties and continue her husband's family's legacy. No one is going to blame Arya for not getting married and having children - she hasn't even hit puberty yet.   There is no reason why two bi people can't have a great relationship. If you're having problems, that shouldn't be the reason. Is your family hung up on some misconception about bi people being more promiscuous or something? Because that's just wrong.  However, if hearing about your boyfriend's past relationships bothers you, I'd say this might be the real reason you're having issues. Have you thought about why it is that him being with guys before your relationship bothers you? Is it because you feel jealous, or think that it somehow threatens your current relationship?  You should probably bring this up with your boyfriend and work something out. Tell him about your misgivings, and you'll be a lot more likely to work through this and find happiness than if you just sit and stew over your family's opinions about two bi people apparently being incompatible because reasons.   I really relate to Brienne. I'm a woman who's not exactly feminine, so I've gotten crap from lots of people my whole life for trying to be "like a boy" or not doing things that are "appropriate for a young girl/lady." Well screw that. I don't wanna be a "young lady," I wanna be me. And being me involves a lot of things that it just so happens aren't stereotypically feminine. So yeah, I can really relate to her struggles with not feeling like she's pretty enough or not having a place in a world that pressures women into being a certain way. And I can relate to a lot of the harassment she gets. I think she's a pretty well written character.   I love comics. In fact, I sometimes talk about comics so much that even my nerdy SO gets tired of my Batman tangents. If I ran into you reading a comic book in the library, I'd actually be more willing to strike up a conversation with you about it than I would most other books.   #44 bothers me, it might be nitpicky but they wrote Peach's name wrong.  When written vertically, the second character should be a straight line going up and down, like this:  [Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/oW8UqTh.png)   I really like kissing and cuddling. I also don't mind groping or making out. But I don't really enjoy full on sex that much, either.   I would certainly be interested.   Wow. That could have gone really, really bad. Glad that you had some nicer (and less ignorant) classmates!   That's ... kinda gross.   I would say that, at least from your description, it seems like you might be bisexual but heteroromantic. In other words, you are attracted to men and women but you only have romantic feelings or desire to have a relationship with men.   THE NEW SEASON OF GAME OF THRONES IS COMING and the premier is on my roommate's birthday so we have an excuse to throw a wicked party. Or just get drunk and eat cake in our underpants, whichever.   Nope. Not at all. It's just clothing. In fact, if there was a freezing girl nearby and he had an extra hoodie/wasn't cold I would consider it rude to not give it to them.   Oh, yeah, the Iron Bank will definitely cause some issues in the future. Littlefinger borrowing from them and Cersei refusing to pay the debt has put the kingdom in a really bad position with the bank. They've already sent one representative to hound people and collect their due, but I doubt they'll stop there.  Even if they still play nice, though, at some point when the war is over whoever becomes king is going to have a huge issue paying them back. I doubt Littlefinger is willing to help anymore - he's moved on to other things besides being the Master of Coin. With winter here there's not going to be a whole lot of trade, either. More likely, they'll go bankrupt just trying to feed people considering the war kept them from reaping the full benefits of autumn harvest and a lot of the fields and crops were seized or destroyed by soldiers from various factions.   And my point was that he would make a much worse ruler than Daenerys because at least she isn't totally psychotic and is willing to actually reason with people instead of demanding things because "I AM THE BLOOD OF THE DRAGON RAWR"   Dany: I am the rightful queen and the mother of dragons!  Random peasant: Well, I didn't vote for you!    Viserys might have made a better ruler if he ever got to be king  I'll have to disagree with you there. Viserys on the throne would not have been much better than Aerys or Joffrey. Don't forget that Viserys was abusive, manipulative, and completely self-absorbed and entitled. At the very least, Dany is attempting to learn from others on how to be a good ruler. Viserys just demands that everyone does what he says because he's a king, despite the fact that he's really a king in exile and his lineage doesn't mean shit to people like the Dothraki who live outside of Westeros.   I agree. If anything, I'd say that Stannis never won love from anyone. He was, however, able to gain the respect of his followers, which is arguably more important in some cases. Still, Melisandre is not particularly good at winning people over to his cause.   I really appreciated Sansa a lot more after reading her POV chapters. In the show she's pretty passive and is mostly just a victim to the cruelty of the Lannisters; in the book, you see that she starts to gain a will of her own and not only finds a way to inject small acts of defiance, but also learns how to play the game of thrones and become more pragmatic rather than depending only on fairy tales.   That's certainly an interesting thought. I'm fairly certain we'll see more of Braavos in the future, especially since that's where Arya is. But how strong is Littlefinger's connection to the place of his ancestors? I suppose we'll find out.    He was also sent off after he got Lysa pregnant.  Actually, he was sent off after he challenged Brandon Stark to a duel; Lysa didn't tell her father about the pregnancy until after Littlefinger had left.  Also, the problem with "create chaos to assume power" is that chaos is rather unpredictable. In the midst of a war like the War of Five Kings, literally anyone can gain or lose power at any time. We see it happen constantly - leaders rise and then die, soldiers change sides, marriages are made and broken. Your fortunes can change before you know it, for better or worse. One of the things that Littlefinger is best at is protecting his own interests, and creating a volatile situation that could just as easily get him killed as it could get him a lordship seems a little risky, even for him.  I won't disagree with you about his hatred of higher nobles, though. There is some deep resentment there.   Wow. That theory actually makes a lot more sense - especially since it would explain pretty clearly why Petyr says he took the virginity of both the Tully girls, not just Lysa.   I'm pretty sure that the Targaryens are the exception, not the rule. For one thing, there aren't that many instances specifically mentioned, but whenever it is mentioned it's usually a group of siblings all marrying. This was so they could keep their Valyrian blood pure. There was no need for anyone else to do this.  Also, you have to keep in mind that in a feudal society like Westeros, everything is based on carrying on the male line; having multiple partners confuses succession, even if they aren't simultaneous relationships (see the Freys). Considering the fact that they literally started civil war over succession, you can see why people might want to keep things less complicated.  Additionally, it seems as if everyone else is going with the two people in a marriage limit; even in Dorne, where some of the nobility have relationships openly with paramours, they still only have one spouse. Margaery Tyrell was married multiple times and there was a lot of emphasis placed on how her marriage with Renly was never consummated and therefore invalid; if bigamy was allowed, this would be less of a concern. And Tyrion also seems to think that his marriage to Sansa is invalidated by his previous marriage and the fact that they never consummated after their wedding.   So I finished reading ADWD earlier this week, meaning I am finally able to read all the posts on the main five books! Huzzah!  I have to say though, the biggest question still burning in my mind after all this time is ... what the hell is Littlefinger's motivation?  It seems to me that his most obvious trait is his ambition. He was humiliated in his youth because of his lower social position, and it seems he'll stop at nothing to gain more power (while screwing over people who were born with it in the process). So his maneuvering to claim a lordship, become ruler of Harrenhall, marrying Lysa, etc. is obviously a part of that goal to gain more power.  What I don't get, though, is why he convinced Lysa to poison Jon Arryn. There are only a few possible reasons I could think of to do this; it's possible he knew that Arryn suspected Cersei's children weren't Roberts, and did it on her orders/to curry favor with her. Considering that he also helped Cersei when he betrayed Ned, it could be that this was all part of a ploy to get on her good side.  But then we're still left with the fact that he basically instigated the War of Five Kings. I just don't get why he would have told Catelyn that Tyrion was responsible for the assassination attempt on Brandon's life. It seems like he's going through an awful lot of trouble for mere personal gain.  Any ideas or theories about what Littlefinger's really planning?   Starfighter was originally a webcomic which I just started reading, so I can't give a great synopsis, but it involves some awesome art and sci-fi goodness. If you haven't read the comic yet, you should check it out [here](http://starfightercomic.com/chapter_01_page.php?page=Chapter_01_Page_01.jpg). If you're interested in the Kickstarter campaign, I would highly encourage you check that out too! I'm personally a big fan of visual novels (essentially a choose-your-own-adventure comic in video game format), but unfortunately not many make it to the English-speaking market. Supporting projects like these means we'll get more in the future though, so I'm certainly considering a pledge.      Looks really interesting! I love the art style.   Yes, I do find other people beautiful. I don't masturbate, and I'm neutral toward sex. But there are lots of other aces who like to do both.   Yeah, that's also true.   Technically, though, she isn't - since Tyrion was already married to someone else.   That is very helpful, actually. I had no idea there were THAT many books. But this certainly gives me more info on where to start so I can finally break into the series. My best friend's family loves these books, so they'll be happy to hear about my finally getting around to reading them.   Yes. But that's exactly why I don't like reading it - it reminds me of when I was young and foolish, lol.   I figured it was probably something like that. I know when I read through sex scenes it usually doesn't phase me, but a lot of times when I see them in movies or on TV I feel really awkward. So I can relate.   I play a Rover, occupation is a Tinker, and I was at the inaugural game in Indiana for the Iron Fields. I also have an NPC character that is a Tinker, which will hopefully be used again in future mods.   Were you at the first game this past weekend? It was pretty awesome!   No, it's totally normal. I don't personally do it, but there are plenty of aces who do. It's just not my thing.   Hm. That would probably be a better reason to skip the show then. If you don't like watching violence you shouldn't watch the show. Also, I'll go ahead and warn you that some parts of the book have pretty violent parts too, so if you don't like reading them be prepared to skip over certain sections.   If you don't like gratuitous nudity, I wouldn't force you to watch the show. You should definitely give the books a try, though!   Ugghhhhh Daario is such a tool, I don't know why Dany ever liked him.   Never heard of those, will check them out though.   But there are also other ways to have more inclusive language. Someone else mentioned that instead of saying "ladies and gay men" you could simply say "people who wanna see hot guys," which totally solves the problem.   Well the scene with Jaime and Cersei that Brandon walks in on is obviously important, also I'd argue that the scene with Drogo and Dany on their wedding night was necessary (but they completely fucked it up in the show). Also emberspark mentioned Jon and Ygrette's scene, which wasn't the one I initially thought of, but actually the scene with Melisandre making weird shadow-babies was kind of plot important.   Well, that and you don't shit where you eat. He owns the brothel, it would be bad business practice to screw his own employees.   Yeah, I like that about it too.   I've heard a lot of good things about Discworld and have read some other stuff by Terry Pratchet (Good Omens), but never got around to that series as there were just so many books in it that it was a little daunting.      Yeah, this actually looks like it would be a lot of fun for the kids, and there are lots of psychological and physical benefits to having a harness like this. Any way you can improve the quality of life for a kid that can't get around easily on their own should definitely be invested in.   Also, so does Tyrion's.   There are at least two sex scenes I can immediately think of that are absolutely necessary to the plot, and another one that while it wouldn't be necessary to give screen/word time to would still be important to mention or imply that it happened, so don't worry, there isn't just a bunch of needless gratuitous sex for no good reason besides sex.   Doesn't she have dreams about him? Can we get sexy dream Drogo?   Porque no los dos?   I can drink to that!  http://photostock.newsmonkey.be/gif/07/03/75.gif   If you like fantasy at all, you should probably give it a shot. The books are pretty fantastic too - it's the best major series in the genre I've read about treating women like actual characters and not symbols or objects, which is nice.   I don't really know either, I was mostly joking. The comment was made in good humor, thus the little tongue smiley thing.   But that's exactly the reason why pan was coined - bi implies that there are only two categories to be attracted to, and it excludes people outside the gender binary. Although there are also some bi people who say they only like two, such as women and agender but not men, for example. But pan covers everything.  Edit: Also to address your initial point, of course people who otherwise identify as nonmonosexual should be included too, I usually go by queer myself. I was mostly teasing the person who made the original comment.   I imagine you would notice though if you had some strange new fabric rubbing up all over them that you don't normally wear.   Okay, that one was pretty good :D   Tormund Giantsbane would totally disagree with you. Also the number of sex scenes in the book is pretty high. Oh, and Tyrion talks about dicks and sex a lot. There is a lot of that sort of thing in ASoIaF.   Well, considering that those types of retreat things are organized for the express purpose of bringing brothers closer together, I'm pretty sure that the campfire would be a good time to come out if you're ready. It will most likely come up in conversation at some point - there's usually some opportunity to share more private things about yourself. Just take the chance when you see it.  Don't worry about saying specific words or trying not to cry. It's okay to be emotional - coming out is a huge thing! It's okay if you cry a little, I'm sure some of the other guys will cry a little too.  The best advice I can give you is to just be yourself. Everything else will work itself out, or you can deal with it later.   For real, that shit is not cool. They go so far to avoid showing dicks on that show during sex, meanwhile naked ladies everywhere (cough Littlefinger cough)   There is an awful lot of talk about breasts, but then Dany also talks a lot about having sex with Drogo, so I think that's more because it's specifically from her point of view so of course she'd notice her own boobs.   http://www.vmusic.com.au/Vmusic.Web/media/images/tyrion_dancing.gif   Well, as someone who is female-bodied, if my partner wanted to be breastfed by me, I would decline. I am not into that.  Not to say that other people can't do it, just not something I would be comfortable with.   There is so much penis with Tyrion alone I'm pretty sure he should be the god of dicks and wine.   Or Hodor.   He deserved to be poked fun at just a little bit, though. He does talk about dicks a lot, and he has been promising dragons for forever ...   Not really. There are a ton of dicks in ASoIaF.   What about all the people who are bi/pan? :p   If your "friends" won't support you in this, fuck 'em. The only way to make things change is to take action, stand up for yourself, and nail this asshole to the wall. You should definitely press charges, and I hope that the law is on your side.   Manly Guys Doing Manly Things is one of my favorite webcomics ever. It's full of so much awesome.   Wow, I can't believe you're doing such an awesome project and kickstarter! I love Rooster Tails, all of your comics are really honest and insightful and funny and all sorts of other wonderful adjectives. I will definitely be contributing.  Also, if you do go on an American tour, you should consider a stop in Louisville! It's a wonderfully queer-friendly city; the first place in the entire state of Kentucky to pass legislation protecting trans rights. I know that there would be plenty of wonderful nerdy people who would love to see you and read your new books. :   You aren't just cute. You are super adorable :   Or panromantic. Unless they're already familiar with GSRM issues (and even then) most people have no idea what pansexual or panromantic mean.   Really though, that bias is in all self-report data; people always want to make themselves look better, and will often change their answers to whatever they think the investigator wants to hear.   I really love the DA TTRPG, it's pretty easy to learn the mechanics and if you play DA at all you're already familiar with the setting.  I don't know if I'll have time to play, as I'm gearing up for the hell that is the end-of-semester-in-college experience. But if I get more time later and you still need people I might join.    My original belief is that he would have taken her by now if that's what they wanted and it seems stupid a nice guy like him would waste his time trying to get someone. And in this time he's actively tried and found another girlfriend and hasn't waited for her to leave me.  I'd say that's probably an accurate assessment. If he was really that interested, he most likely would have made a move.  And yeah, the problem probably has a lot to do with your anxiety. I know how that sort of thing can really make you stress out over something that turns out to not be a big deal. However, it seems really real and important in the moment, so it's good that you took the time to examine this. Introspection, even when overblown, can still be a good thing. Sometimes you just have to stop and assess your life every once in a while to make sure things are all on track.  Anyway, though, just letting it go is probably the best course of action here. If problems arise in the future you can deal with them then, but there's nothing horribly wrong going on right now so try to relax. :   To borrow your metaphor, yes, "board members" get to all have a say on what will affect the corporation. However, each board member is still an individual person - they only come together to make decisions when those particular decisions affect the corporation. But whenever they are spending time out of the office, they are free to do whatever they wish with their own personal life. And if one of those board members hangs out with people that another board member doesn't happen to like, that doesn't really matter because what they do in their personal time is separate from the corporation.  Sure, marriage does make you to some extent part of a "joint life," but it doesn't mean that now and forever you have to do every little single thing together. The two people who are married are still two people; no matter how much their vows say otherwise, it would be impractical if each of them had to ask the other for permission before stepping out of the house or going to the bathroom. And whenever you're in an open relationship, that means that you and your spouse have the "corporation" but everyone you meet outside of that corporation is a part of "personal time," unless you both choose to bring them into the corporation as well. In other words, OP's relationship with the other guy is separate from her time with her SO, since they aren't both dating him; therefore, she and she alone determines how to proceed with their relationship. Husband might not approve, but since it doesn't directly affect their marriage he can't just outright tell her no. He can merely inform her of his opinion - ultimately the decision is hers.   When you marry someone, you might acknowledge their opinion as important to you. But that does not mean they have a right to control various aspects of your life, especially if it doesn't directly affect them. Women aren't their husbands' property. It is not a husband's job to tell his wife who she can and cannot be friends with or talk to or whatever.   I dunno, I kinda like the sound of dr_fishy, lol. But yeah, I might change my mind later, just for now I want a break so I can figure out what to do with my life outside of academia.   Unfortunately :/   Thanks. As much as I wish I could quit, I also know that finishing my degrees will be better for me in the long run. Although I'm pretty positive now that I won't be going to grad school, I'm way too burned out. But you're right, it won't be bad forever, and I only have to hang in there for one more year so it's not too bad.   They can hurt if you don't put them in far enough, but assuming you're doing it correctly (it's not that hard, so I don't doubt you are) you shouldn't even feel them while they're in there. So no, it is definitely not normal for tampons to hurt.   Yeah, I remember that one too. It was pretty good, even if it was super depressing ...   While it is possible that your bro's girlfriend has a problem with some of the flirting, I wouldn't say that the three of you are weird or wrong at all to have the close friendship that you do. As long as the three of you are all comfortable with one another, and there are no hard feelings between you, you should be able to do whatever you want with your friends, even if it includes flirting or talking about sex. That sort of thing is pretty harmless.  However, if you really want to assuage your fears you should probably talk to the other guy's girlfriend about it. Next time you see her, just pull her aside and say, "hey, I know you know how we are and that we joke around a lot, but we never explicitly talked about it, so I just wanted to make sure that none of that stuff really bothers you. If it does, we'll stop."  Don't worry too much about being assholes this whole time without even knowing it. Most likely, even though the other girl doesn't join in it probably doesn't bother her that much, otherwise she most likely would have said something by now. And if it does actually bother her, it's on her for not being clear about it - not your fault for not knowing her true feelings, especially if she went this long without saying something.   This seems like it would be a really efficient method for TPing someone's house.   Of course I do. I feel like an important part of healthy self-image is being able to laugh at yourself. So yeah, I make jokes about my asexuality with the friends I'm out to quite often. I think my fallback is usually whenever we're on some sort of topic about sexiness/attractiveness and I'm just like "I literally don't give a fuck."   Agreed - it seems to me less like K is too immature to be with OP and more like husband is to immature to be with OP.   I understand that you love your husband and don't want to jeopardize your marriage. However, your husband does not get to pick who you have feelings for. He can't control your heart, any more than you can. It sounds like he has all this misconceptions about K, and honestly he comes off as really judgmental and hypocritical. How can he say whether or not K is mature enough to handle a relationship with you? Who made him the love police?  If I were you, I would just tell my husband firmly but politely that he doesn't have any say in this. You're poly, you can date whoever you want, and as long as nothing really dangerous is going on (abuse, drugs, crime, etc.) there is no reason for him to intervene. He might not like K as much as you, but that doesn't mean he gets to dictate what happens in either of your lives.   Usually, yeah, they do. And yeah, at least half of them were somewhere along those lines.  Still, there were more than a few supportive comments, which was nice. And it wasn't so bad that it had stooped to the level of YouTube comments, at least.   I'm genuinely shocked by the number of upvotes I got for it, tbh.  	106
 Hell has frozen over.    Captain Falcon, Pit, Wii Fit Trainer, Marth- 54952   Had to choose 3 amiibo on release date...  Got Villager and Link (they didn't have Marth), so I needed to choose between Wii Fit Trainer and Mario.   Chose Mario.    I've found no Pit, Marth or WFT amiibos in my entire state. A few Falcons are about an hour away, though, and everyone seemingly has Luigi. Thank you for this!     Diddy's pretty rare.  I've only seen one in store. Like, ever.     Ursula, Cruella and Maleficent are WAY more iconic than most of those characters. It also helps that they've set up Ursula for a while, and they've apparently planned out an explanation for Maleficent. The only one that's confusing people is Cruella.   I TRY TO NOT SUCK AT SMASH, BUT THIS ASS WIPE SAT THERE AND FUCKING U-AIRED CONSTANTLY AS MARTH AS A COMBO, THEN TEABAGGED OVER AND OVER AGAIN. I DISCONNECTED AND HE REPORTED ME.  SPEAKING OF MARTH, I WANT THAT AMIIBO DAMMIT!    They told me they couldn't hold anything due to it being holiday hours or something. All I can say is I'm happy I picked up Villager on release day, and regret grabbing Mario over WFT.   I'm still on the hunt, but it looks like I'll have to rely on Ebay.    Wisconsin native here. When I called in to a local Target, they told me SPECIFICALLY they had WFT and Marth on shelves, and described them. But when I got there, they said they never had them and that it was out of stock for about 2 weeks.   They didn't apologize for the inconvenience.   I've searched all 3 Targets in my area (Appleton/Menasha), all 4 GameStops, 2 Best Buys, and a Wal-Mart. No success.     GOD DAMN IT  WHEN I ASK ABOUT MARTH AMIIBOS AND YOU SAY YOU HAVE THEM, AND DESCRIBE THEM PERFECTLY, DONT TELL ME IT WAS NEVER IN STOCK WHEN I GET THERE  ALSO, I HAVENT PLAYED ROB AT ALL AND YET YOU GIVE ME ALL OF HIS CUSTOM MOVES FIRST WHEN I PLAY AS FUCKING EVERYONE ELSE  I KNOW I SUCK AT SMASH, BUT CAN ROSALINA PLAYERS ACTUALLY PROVIDE A CHALLENGE ON FOR GLORY INSTEAD OF FUCKING ROLLING N' SHIT AND SPAMMING LUMA SHOT   ALSO I HATE YOU EVENT MATCHES  AND CHEAP-ASS KILLS ON CRAZY ORDERS I SPENT MONEY ON YOU I COULD'VE USED TO BUY A FUCKING POWER PELLET TROPHY  WHY THE FUCK IS THERE A SHITTY POWER PELLET TROPHY   All stores in my area carry nothing but Mario and assorted.   There is no way for me to find them in-store.    So, the last time I hosted a tournament, it was a huge mess, no communication between us and just major problems everywhere. While the tournament had nearly no lag (Way to go, Brawl!), it was just confusing and people couldn't hear.   This time, I'm hosting one IRL with some friends from school. What do I do in order to keep it running smoothly?    When I sent in my Wii U for repairs, I asked them if it would be back in time for Smash Bros. for my little brother. Not only did they allow us to ship it for free, but they also arranged overnight shipping at no extra cost.   Their customer service rocks.    Season Finale: Emma, Elsa and Anna fight against the now-evil Baby Neal, who has magic abilities like Emma now and summons Cthulhu or something as his servant creature.   Plus the Three Little Pigs.    I honestly like the idea of an open world type of Sonic game. If they implemented characters right, and still featured some levels like the Classic and Modern styles in Sonic Generations, it would work. I'd love a game like this.   I think the main problem is transferring the speed and excitement of the previous games over to this open world. What would work best is the Sonic Adventure formula, but with larger levels inbetween the "Gotta go Fast" zones, and a few 2.5D Classic-styled segments as well.    	15
 As a somewhat native speaker (I grew up bilingual, with English being the slightly more preferred language), I must say that  is a word that I've never really had to use, as compared to  My take would be that  seems more like an adjective to describe a thing or person as being spontaneous but  is used more like an adverb to modify a verb? That's why I would say  fits better into your sample sentence.  	1

 no need to be rude about it man..   Just put a 5.0 in the Mach and go crazy. I'm biased though since I like the New Edge look and the Mach look.   Beats mine, man. I would kill to upgrade.   nope.   AWH SHIT, YA GOT ME WITH MY 12 YEAR OLD. How will I ever survive now..   So cool to be an asshole, jeez man, it's his car. Fuck off if you don't like it. He can do whatever he wants. I think it's pretty cool, since I've only seen it once.   72k miles in 2 years?   Is that a bad thing? -cracks knuckles-   Any more pictures? I'm jealous!   Just got her.      Well, shit..   Fuck yeah man, manual widows! And someone said that there's an auto detailing subreddit, which could help with the paint and stuff, so you might wanna check that out!   Yeah, I'm not a fan of them, but it's what I gotta deal with for a tiny bit of time, and it's the least of my worries. I will check out auto detailing, and see what they recommend! Thank you!   I got her for 1750$, which, for what it is, was surprising. I might need to do a new engine in the future, but I think it will last me at least some time, since I'll mainly only use it to get to work which is ~10 minutes away at most. I don't plan on running it hard. Thankfully!   I'm dumb, I read interior. Yeah, I mean there's some fading, only on the front by the headlights, so it's not too bad. I will definitely try my best to keep it as clean and nice as possible.   Yes, yes it does. That was the main thing I was looking for!   I feel you, I don't love it, but it's sort of grown on me since after looking for a car, they're all I can find! I need to deoxy the headlights, touch up some paint, and she'll be a beaut! Thank you for the kind words.   Believe me, I HATE when people try to make a car something its not. I haven't gotten it up to anything, unless you count 15-20ish "up", I need to go get tags and all that fun stuff since I literally just got it. I'm quite excited to play around with it!   '95 v6 5 speed      I was gonna give you a baby for the 5.0.. damn.   Please.   Oh I know, its one of the the few blues that I actually have interest in, and holy shit, that must be a thing to see. I've only ever seen one Mach in my area and it was a cobra swap, not as cool other than the glass window in the hood where the shaker was and the neon lights. :P   Yeah, its definitely a nice crowd, I've been looking at the Machs, specifically the Azure Blue with a new Engine in it.   I've been looking at them for so long, just drooling over them. SVTPerformance has so many great termis, that it hurts to log on to it :(   Am I the only one who hasn't gotten one yet. God damn it.   They look purpleish-blue to me.   Jack/Geoff   Fucking lovely. Nice ride man.   Oh I do too, Currently trying to talk to my credit union to see if I can get it.   And guns!   You're just made of cash and cars, aren't you, Mister?   Just bought the book.   So, you would like to use that nickname? [YES]         [NO]   Are you sure?  [YES]         [NO]   Are you sure? [YES]       [NO]   Inbox it bro    Nawh brah, you don't, you wouldn't be player hatin'   Its a Shelby Cobra emblem.   brah, gtfo, we don't want you anyways. go enjoy your civic.   Yeah, that's what I use. Hoping they'll give me enough for a decent new edge. :D   Brah, brah, please. I'm trying to get a loan right now to join the cool kids club.   Good. Bitch.   OP, pls...   Thats an insanely clean Saleen, any more details? And Karma? This subreddit gets MAYBE 10 upvotes hahaha. ;)   I rarely find colors that I like, but lava really is beautiful, so is Mystichrome but we can't get that nowadays factory.   God I love lava red...   Come on Heer_, you're making me a bit too jealous. :(  Gorgeous like always, but maybe a bath would be in need soon. ;P   You're all in /r/wtf, did you expect ponies and rainbows. Expect NSFW/L, Gore, ect...    So he's a GRAPIST too?   Thank you for your answer, and I understand it's a stressful job, and they give you no slack. I've been actually doing really fine, no problems, but then again I still have 9 months until I can MAYBE join, so we'll see if anything changes. Thanks again!   Ooooh, I get you!   That's my bike.   But there is also more v6s than v8s, so that kinda helps out v6s in the lead here. Not saying your wrong though, driver error and neglect is a big part, and I was saying that since he's a teen, he's not gonna be the best at handling power, and paying attention.   Idk, I've seen some really stupid football players. No offense to your son, or your family name. And I'm not doubting you, I'm just saying! Hopefully he is mature enough to handle that beautiful beast, and tell him I said congrats on getting a ride to college! It's a lot more than I could have done, haha!   Awesome! Thanks!   You're 120hp lower than him, though.   He's gonna crash it, bet ya 10$.   Has no one realized, that they shouldn't use Red Box?   I like them, they have a lot of special editions in those years, like the Mach 1, Cobra, Crimson red 40th, Roush, and Saleen which all look incredible. In my opinion they have the best rear of any Mustang, but power isn't huge unless you get a Mach, which has the equivalent power of a recent V6, or a 03/04 Cobra since that's 390hp.    *oh*   I would definitely go back to golden brown, man.   I feel you. I'm going for a Mach 1 in about a month, hopefully I'll have enough funds to get it. I really want a TR 10th Termi but that'll run me 22+ for what I want with it.   SVTPerformance has them from 17-35 depending on mods/mileage. Pretty good stuff!   WHYY!   Hahahah!   OP pls respond.   Hudson River was a Narrow body, OP is talking about Wide body. Source:All dem comments.   She's 15, not 5.   ITT: Suddenly everyone cares about feelings.   Yeah, the Mach 1s were styled from the 69's and 70's, hence the style of the gauges, stripes (side and hood), spoiler, hell even the seats! I think they look really good TBH, it's way different from the other NewEdges.   I know, he takes care of it! And yes they are factory!   Ouch dude, that blows. Thankfully you're alright! Hopefully you get what you want out of this, like you said, a V8!   Yeah, hopefully! haha. It's beautiful.   Nice, a lightning!   My god.   It looks really good for it's age. Nice NewEdge man!   C'mon pls.   Aww, I feel so bad for him.   This is 5 days old, I don't know why you thought the input was needed.   I give them credit, that was pretty clever.   xD!! 2Funneh!   What the fuck.   PlS dO ThaT!    He's "eye" has a small Purple Heart inside of it. He's probably not ashamed by it and decided to not care, I mean if I had a Purple Heart in my eye, that'd be sick as shit.   *EDIT* I'm challenged, didn't scroll far enough.  My bad dood.    I could see the preview on mobile and I still clicked it... What's wrong with me.   Oh god, it is weird.   Dude...   Yeah, let me show off my daughter in hopes someone will want to visit my shop. Yup.   I'd love to help! Don't get me wrong, but I need to focus more on my life and helping myself get through and over obstacles. I will return though to help out. :)   Yeah, I'd definitely try to see how low I can go. And probably look at terminators too, since they're my dream car. Gonna be hard to find a TR 10th for under 20k :(   Thank you, if I feel down in the dumps, I most definitely will be back for a check up. :)   Thank you, that made me laugh!   Ha!   Thank you all for your kind worded comments. I woke up with a huge smile on my face. :)   Cool brah.   I replied to the guy who replied to you. It was aimed at both of you, and if you'd like you can read it as reply.  Thank you for your input, and I understand where you're coming from. :)   It's definitely about how you look at it. I understand that it's hard, and you get yelled at, which is fine. It toughens you up. I've wanted to join since I was a small child, it is about pride to me and about the benefits of college, friendship, and strengthening myself. My uncles have gone through it all, and one of my only friends has been enlisted for little over a year in the Marines. Whilst another is currently in BT for the Army.  Yeah you can get lonely, homesick, and all that. But that's life, and that's what I choose.  Thank you, and the guy you commented to, for both of your inputs. I greatly appreciate it!   Thank you.   Cobras are my favorite. If you have more pictures, r/NewedgeMustang would love to see it. :)   Idk man, either way she doesn't look like a Chloe. PERSONAL OPINION RIGHT HERE THOUGH.   [Idk man, she looks like Ellen Page.](http://i.imgur.com/BSGQ5I1.jpg)   Really hoping to get a NewEdge as soon as I land my job interview tomorrow. ;)      Thankfully this one only puts down 405, and not 600's like some of them. ;)   That a big fucking probably.   Ah, now I see! Would love to see it when you have the new wheels!  	109
 Well I must be like......bottom of the barrel instead of close to average.  The idea of asking a woman out scares the piss out of me, not because women are scary....it's because they can be pretty nonchalant or callous about it and it starts to add up after awhile for me.  And if one approached me, I'd figure it was a prank being played on me or someone setting me up to harvest me for organs.  It's gotten to the point where a woman being a little more than just friendly with me makes me start to have feelings for her.  And this is exactly what everyone is always saying is being a creep, because her being nice doesnt mean she's interested.    So her being nice doesnt mean she's interested.  And her being anything else doesnt mean she's interested.   So......die alone.    Even though I have no children, no wife, etc.  A lot of what you said here really hits some points I've been noticing lately with myself.  You are very lucky to have your husband to talk to about these things.   No one I know (not getting paid for it at least) wants to hear these things, and it's just horrible in both counts to not have anyone....and trying to confide and seeing they don't get it or don't want to hear these things.  It's........like a weight you can't put down and only gets heavier each time you are denied the ability to talk about it for me.  Made myself cry saying this.    Do YOU think you're crying and anxiety is a problem?  If you do, then you should probably try to deal with it through therapy or something as your parents aren't going to be sympathetic to you judging on the comment.  If you don't think it's a problem, then do what you gotta do then file whatever they say under "Shit my parents said that doesnt help".   I have anxiety, small stuff bugs the hell out of me.  I don't feel like people relate to it, which is why I see a therapist to put things in some perspective I guess.  You have to figure your parents have went through school, having kid(s), etc and other things to give them a potentially "higher" baseline for stuff to get anxious over.  Although it doesnt mean they didn't worry about shit when they were younger, they just can't relate to their younger selves anymore.  And I'll say that the pressure NOW versus 20-30 years ago on people trying to find their way is much higher.  Things are more blown out of proportions because of social media and the sheer amount of bullshit you see on a daily basis that seems important.  You rarely see all the bad shit in people's facebook feeds, makes it seem like you righteously pissed off some divine being who wants to make your life a living hell in comparison.     Well I think in the end it's going to come back to you.  If you think you can tough out a year or two at a place at the higher pay....you could always try to negotiate higher pay at your existing job once you have an offer on the table from one of the others.  Though people will often counsel that you run the risk of making your job insecure by doing that.  It's unfortunately the only way to apparently get pay raises that aren't cost of living the majority of the time.  Got a friend looking at doing something very similar now because he's under paid, but really likes his job.  Although he has some concerns about it a year or two out.    I think you make a point on most.  But I don't think you can say with any confidence that you have job security or not based on what you've stated.  Lower end of the pay scale could also mean you're doing the stuff no one else being paid more wants to take the time to do for now.  Or that your company doesn't value your skill sets as much as they should......etc.  I PERSONALLY think that MANY managers/companies think that "newer" is better.  It's a game where they like to take their competitions workers as often as they can and they end up feeling like they have the best people simply because they stole someone away.  And often because of this weird logic they get into, people "hop" away from a company they like, to get the pay they deserve, to hop back to the company they like so they can be there and get the money they deserve as well.  I think it's stupid as hell that you have to think like that, but it seems to be the way things are right now.  Make sure your job title is "more impressive" if you move, plan on working there for 1-3 years depending on some factors...like if nothing changes for 2 years...you got a reason to leave "it got stale".  But if in a year they are being bought out, you move for "job security"...etc.  If you like where you work and are happy, that has a lot of weight to it.  But getting into a higher pay tier might make you "happier" in other ways....house sooner, kids on the way.......new car......retire sooner.  And only you can answer what that extra pay means to you, whether you do or don't switch.  Exploit anything your company has for furthering your education/degree/training reimbursements, etc.  Since staying might make them take another look at your "ambition" outside of work, and if you switch..and are afraid of job security...knowing more never hurt too much.    Think it's more about having a "something has your back" reason for hope.  Than more of a religious conversion in your case probably.  My therapist basically made it known he's a Christian, which I was raised that way but I loathe organized religions.....some of the worst people  (even family members) I've ever met use them like a shroud to do bad shit.  In the case of my therapist and myself, I don't think he'd try to convert someone.  But he does use his religion as an example as to how he comes to peace with things that have troubled him in the past.  He has basically said that if you identify as "X" he wants to make you the best X you can be.  Whether it be a religion, trans-sexual, whatever you want to identify as.  So........ you might consider that before you throw it away.  Since it's sometimes hard to find someone you have any kind of commonalities with sometime, and can be pretty frustrating to try to make them understand your approach or way of thinking sometimes....to the point where you spend more time trying to make them understand something than actually moving on.     They have to report it if you have credible plans to hurt yourself or others.  You can ask the therapist to explain it and say "it's not something I plan on doing, but ..."  So.......IMO it's important to talk about because they are going to have better records/memory of your conversations than you will since HOPEFULLY your mindset will change over time and thinking like you are now will be "alien" in a way....like how "normal" people can't understand how horrible it is when you try to describe depression/etc to them.    Oh I've been out of college for awhile with my degree.  I had a couple CS-related jobs I hated with a passion and just gave up on the whole programming aspect after that.  I am currently toying with the idea of going back for a masters degree.  I hate to have a bachelors in CS that is essentially a waste of time and money, so would like to find something that builds on it but doesn't lend itself so easily to being "taken advantage of"/"Abused" in the working world.  Really think schools should take more time to help people better evaluate what the reality of their degree looks like when they finish.   I will say I don't feel I've been successful as a CS major and lost interest/passion for it, which I am trying to recover slowly or find something that pushes the CS button but fulfills other criteria I've developed.  Like:  Solving puzzles and varying degrees of detail you can take towards an approach to the solution.  Dislike:  The corporate culture that says you have to learn all of the new things on your own time, pay for books/classes with your own dime, and yet not get paid/reimbursed for your efforts the majority of the time.  Another dislike:  Sometimes having no noticeable progression on a project/task and trying to deal with people who want constant and often unrealistic updates.   Did this problem come up after you did a BIOS install or anything in particular?  If so you could try a CMOS reset on the BIOS to see if it will undo the unwanted change.  I don't have the motherboard to look at the menu system, so just wondering how it got turned on.    Talk to your doctor...I have it too.  You might need something else...like therapy to bridge the gap to normal.  Therapy takes awhile, but it's useful.   Hot.   36 year old guy and I'm lonely. I am white, brown hair, blue/green eyes, overweight (working on it), and am pretty inexperienced at dealing with women in general. I'm open-minded, like to hear about new things.....told I have a pleasant voice and that I'm intelligent.  I am looking for an ongoing conversation with a woman, let's say 20-35, light skinned, nice smile, medium/long hair. I'm into larger chested women, you being overweight is not an issue, I just like proportionality. In fact it really bothers me to find out there are so many good looking women who think they are nothing special roaming the planet. I don't lie when it comes to my opinion on looks, outfits, hair, etc.... Ideally I'd like to get a lot of pictures from you and you'd want my opinion on them, but really not necessary. The IMPORTANT part of this is that you WANT to talk and contribute to the conversations, or even kick off a days conversations if we've lapsed due to whatever. And if you are not interested in talking anymore, let me know so I'm not left wondering.  Interests:  Reading, mostly fantasy. Series include Dresden files, Stormlight Archives, Codex Alera, Mistborn, etc.  TV. Supernatural, Workaholics, Sleepy Hollow, Tosh, Grimm, lots of others  Movies. Behind on movies, but I like comedies and action probably the most.  Video Games. Guild Wars 2 mostly, but Borderlands, FPS and other type of games only game on PC.  I have a Computer Science degree, and am currently looking into options for going back for a masters in something to open up some job options...still doing my research. Was looking at jobs for longevity and growth, something like Healthcare, Financial, or possible network security types...so if you're in any of those in the tech side....would be interested in hearing about your experience with them. The generic descriptions on the web don't do much for me overall.  I have frequent depression, and some family experience with other mental health stuff if you would like to talk about those with someone with a little experience it.  Just be genuine, hold up your end of the conversation, and open up a little when appropriate and we'll get along fine. Like I said I really enjoy getting pictures from women, but no pressure there beyond an initial confirmation photo swap possibly.  I have skype and kik, but do not have video capabilities at the moment for skype video. And really just want to text starting out to meet the personality first, maybe with a picture exchange to at least avoid catfish/troll scenarios.  PM me questions, kik name, etc. Can go from there. And if you read this post and it's old, chances are Im still looking. Guys on here don't get too many replies from these things.    Grats to the guy, bagged him a catch.   You have such a pretty face and smile.   I've never been married or had kids.  But the rest of the stuff I can relate to.  People can sense the depression/self hatred/negativity that comes along with it.  Havent spoken to many of my friends in years.  I've been seeing a therapist for...........4-5 months now.  And I don't think I started feeling better until I finally felt like I could tell them everything and that was a couple months in.  It's not even telling them everything, it's having them be able to communicate that they see that you feel stuck.  The first thing is that you have to take the view that as long as you are trying and putting all the effort you can into your job hunt, addressing your issues, etc......that you aren't a failure.  Failure is when you quit, and I myself quit many things because of the depression.  Sounds easy when you write it out, it's TREMENDOUSLY hard.    The therapist will probably tell you to keep a regular schedule, take a shower and change into clothes you would leave the house in...so you at least did that "normal" thing.  Eat regularly even if you aren't hungry.  Don't drink alcohol.  Take your medications, especially if you are on anti-depressants...but even your blood pressure/blood sugar can make your mood worse.  Also thyroid issues can cause depression, so if you have the potential for that you need to get it checked.   Personally I found talking to people to help, outside of therapy.  Lack of contact really makes you feel worthless on top of everything else.  Doesnt even necessarily have to be about the depression itself, just express the "loop"/"trap" you are in and see if they can see the best path forward or at least they say "Well you're doing everything you can, see your therapist, etc".  I personally don't think people can truly comprehend the self-hatred that comes with that deep depression unless they've had it.   And people pick up on it, I am 100% sure it bleeds through on job interviews especially if you really don't want that position as much as they'd like you to pretend you do.     So, I say therapy, express what you've said here.  Get a therapist you like, if you don't like the first one you meet go to another.  If you don't want to talk to a man about it, get a woman, old vs young, etc.  Apply to interviews and go, just try to picture the best possible outcome.  Try not to let the negativity toward your skillset/self take over.  Maybe even work on that first with your therapist since everyone needs money.  Another thing I've been told:  Sex, chocolate, sunlight, exercise, and regular sleep help depression.  So chocolate up your husband and go screw outside somewhere after a nap possibly. :)    Glad you stayed.  STILL wondering your age! heh    Last two are good.   36 year old guy and I'm lonely.

I contemplate it nearly everday, even on days where Im not especially depressed or have any reason to be upset more than normal.    I don't live any sort of perfect life, and I am trying to improve it.  But I think it stems from so many things being out of my control that struggling to improve and having essentially anyone else but me be able to decide when dreams get fulfilled in many circumstances becomes overwhelmingly daunting.  And it might be a bit of 'the grass is always greener' in that perhaps if there is a life after death, it'll be less shit and more enjoyment.     Beautiful boobs.   If you say "Im going to kill myself tonight", they are required by law to act.  If you say "I think about suicide often."  Then it can be discussed....  Be honest...... but before you go hog wild with the therapist, just see if you like them as a person.  You can always ask to see someone else if you dont think you'll get along with them.   	23
 Can anyone tell me where these woods are? I want to do some research on the Whistlers. To me, it seems as though they are just people that are driven to this primal place in order to survive these woods, and then are drawn into a war they had no idea was taking place with this creature out there. This creature is the true problem, the reason that people may die. However, if the Whistlers can get to the people first, then the people would be safe.    Keep us updated as to whether or not it's Tommy!! And stay safe, OP. Seriously, the supernatural is not something you want after you. Ever.    I just won't tell anyone about her :D Then she can't kill me, can she?   So I'm curious, and a little lost, OP. What does cracking your knuckles do?    First, I want to thank everyone here for your support :) you're a great group of people, and I'm glad I have this sub.   Second, this isn't a work related injury. It's just pain brought on by my arthritis. I appreciate everyone's concern, but this isn't the first time this has happened. I'll get through it, I was just hoping someone would have some advice on pain management :/   So some background first. I work in an office as a facilities assistant. That basically means I'm the Break Room Fairy. I stock up the break rooms in the morning, check/set up the conference rooms, deliver mail, that sort of thing. This typically means I'm on my feet all day. As someone with early onset arthritis in one of my knees, this can become quite painful.   However, today was different. I was delivering some packages, and went to turn around on my heel, a motion I have made thousands of times around here. The only difference? I somehow twisted wrong, and my knee explodes into an instant ten on the pain scale. I couldn't move, nor could I call out. My coworkers don't know I have these knee problems, and letting them know would be bad, as it's only my fifth week on this job. After a few minutes, the pain subsided to an easy seven, but has remained there since. This happened about an hour ago, and every time I go to turn, instant ten again. I just don't know what to do, I'm hoping someone can help? Maybe a couple of pointers, other than not turning on that leg? As I work in an office, it's incredibly difficult to not move and turn this way and that....  Sorry for the long post!!   I haven't started season ten yet!! Don't tell me anything!! I tried to start it on Hulu, but Hulu is really dumb and only streams the 5 most recent episodes. So I haven't started it yet.   Do you know what House she belongs to? Because that could be a very big gift op there.   Are you Sirius with that? That was a very Harry joke.   Honestly, I want them to go back to the roots of the show. Start bringing in new monsters like the first season. Or even repeat a few monsters we've seen before. We've seen a few episodes with Shapeshifters, and Vamps of course. But only one werewolf, one woman in white, one Wendigo, etc. However, over 100 demon episodes, plenty with angels, and the like. Honestly, I want some new damn material.   	10
 Communication studies. My university is considering a policy that mandates students cannot workouts than 20 hours on campus. 20 hours is one assistantship, which just isn't cutting it.    All great suggestions! I am a white female getting an MA in Communication Studies. My assistantship includes TAing and teaching one of my own classes. It feels like an impossible task to find scholarships for a non-minority, non-STEM graduate student.    My stipend covers rent and utilities. It would be helpful to have a little extra money for groceries and insurance. I really don't want to take out loans. Does anyone have tips for where to look for scholarships for additional living expenses? I got $500/semester grant from the government and that covers my mandatory fees. Thanks!!    Take some time to do something for yourself. It doesn't have to cost anything, or take a lot of time. Just try to appreciate making a decision to spend time doing something for yourself like taking a walk, listening to music, or reading a book. I've learned that the more I appreciate and respect myself, the better I am at communicating with others. Good luck! YOU come first.    I am on the opposite side of the issue. In fact, one of the worst things about depression for me is that I don't know how to ask my boyfriend or close friends to help. Last night, I called the suicide hotline. I am not suicidal, but I wanted to talk to someone about this extra burden I feel. I don't think I got any straight-forward answers, because I got the feeling that they are just there to listen and guide your thoughts while giving you a chance to talk. However, I don't think I was looking for straight-forward answers. I just needed someone to talk to that I didn't have a committed friendship or with.   TLDR: Call the suicide hotline for depression counseling. They are also there to help people whose loved ones have depression.    Is there a reason why you HAVE to go? He should understand your anxiety. Is there anything you can ask him to do to make it easier on you? Are there things you can focus on enjoying like how well your boyfriend plays his instrument, or how you can reward yourself when you get home? Good luck!!    I don't know what your situation is, but I will offer advice with mine. I am in school, and have been seeing my doctor for 9 months. I know I can call and leave a message in the office for a renewal, but if I wanted a higher dosage, I feel like she should be willing to either prescribe it to me (upon hearing the patterns I experience) or recommend me to a doctor in my new area.   If you call and ask, the worst thing that can happen is they say no. Which is hard when you have depression, but are also able to ask questions beyond those that warrant yes/no answers.   Good luck. You owe this to yourself!!   	7
 I mean of course it is. But I heard 300mg of adrafinil is about 50mg of modafinil, I took 650mg, so about 100mg of modafinil, only effects were a light body "high" i.e. my legs and hands were a little floaty. Other than that nothing. No focus no energy.   Does it have a come down and is there solid research done on it?   It does for sure. But I took 600mg of adrafinil and 18mg of caffeine 3 hours ago, still absolutely no affect. Should I try modafinil once I'm out of adrafinil? And should I continue to take my adrafinil even with no effects?  	3
 When some people find their outlet for management of their disease, it can override everything else. I havent found mine yet, but when people like that do, it's pretty inspiring.   If you're over 18 Just insist on confidentiality. Unfortunately without a professional diagnosis there's no way to be sure. The brain is an incredibly complicated thing that even those with decades of training and experience are only beginning to grasp an understanding of. That's why medication and treatment is a truly trial and error process, we don't understand how it works.   It's hard to put into words, and unless you experience, comes off as whiny but I'll try.   I can't picture anything good happening ever. I have hope it will someday, but if a good thought enters my mind, I work out 10 ways it can and will go horribly. I hate myself, my body, everything about me and have a complete overwhelming sense of hopelessness and despair about my life and how i effect those around me.   No no. I was originally diagnosed as atypically depressed because I can sometimes find joy in day to day life. Something as absurd as that name, though still serious, has to be laughed at no matter how sad you feel.   I know, I completely lost my shit for a good minute. Think I concerned the doc.    Elegant though that reply was it missed the mark of what happens with mental disorders completely. There is no test for chemical imbalance. A psychiatrist makes observation and recommendation and you find the right prescription and dosage through, for lack of a better term, trial and error. Think about the topic being discussed a little harder before you flaunt your ignorance   Think of it like trying to move a huge dresser up a narrow flight of stairs with just two people. Watching a happy video is like doing the whole thing by sliding it on the carpet. It gets a little further, but doesnt help that much and is eventually going to slide back down.    Moved out of my parents house five years ago but sure.    Yeah, Ive gone through periods of weight loss where that's been better, just hasn't gone all the way and I fall back on old habits.   In my darker periods it can be. Sometimes cripplingly so, to the point where I can't make it from my bed to the couch. Those are the days that I have to really struggle to get through   That always does seem to oddly help. I've always put others first and making them happy makes me happy in return. No such thing as a truly selfless act.   It's no bore but I appreciate the support, and am going to start working towards it.   I understand, and thanks for the support. As I've been saying, I don't want sympathy, it wasn't for cake day, I simply saw a depression topic on the front page, and thought it would make an interesting discussion. Thanks.   Lol. Much appreciated. Thanks!   Not meaningless at all. And it's not false hope, that's what's keeping me going. Thanks for the good wishes!   It does but I'm dealing with it as best I can.    Yeah. I was on Lexapro for a while, and it worked good for me for a few months before I plateaud. Made another friend drive into oncoming traffic. There's just no real way to know.    We've started me out on prozac but I think Avanza is one of the alternatives we discussed if that doesn't pan out.    That was the point of the ultimately futile part of that and why I did my second point.    psycho to your panda?   It's essentially when you have dysthmia mixed with a major depressive disorder.  Dysthymia is the more common thing that most people will get at some point in their lives. It's minor but it can get overwhelming and crippling. When people say they feel trapped and can never feel happy, that's usually recurring Dysthymia.  Double depression takes that and combines it with a major depressive disorder. Which has a quicker onset and greater initial impact. So when you mix the two together, it's like taking on someone else's heavy camping backpack while you're already lugging two armfuls of your own shit up a hill.    quite the opposite. How are you dealing with it?   Anytime.    Very cool, I'm glad you found someone who's crazy offsets your crazy.    It's cliche but it really is like walking down a never ending pitch black tunnel with water up to your shins. It's cold, uncomfortable, and suffocating. It gets to the point where (unless you also have an anxiety disorder) you don't worry about anything because nothing matters, nothings ever going to pull you out of this. No one's been in your tunnel before, sure they've had their own tunnels but yours is different and no one has a map to it, so you just wander.   It's not that I'm ok with it, I've just lived so long with it it's a part of me and I had to develop the sense of humor to not open a couple veins in a bathtub lest things get so damn dark.   Thanks for the question! Let me know if I can help anymore.    I appreciate that but it's not always that simple. The way our brains work sometimes it's not something that we can work around with a well timed fuck it. Sometimes it's something baser and chemical.    Or my insanity drop to the point where I no longer perceive it and so therefore become paranoid that it's so overwhelmed me I can't know which drives me insane again.   It's a vicious circle, Just goes round and round.    I want to feel better, not nothing.    I will look it up. Thanks!   Joking aside, making someone else laugh is the biggest high I've ever gotten.    To crush my enemies, see them driven before me, and hear the lamentations of the women.    All the time. But labeling it as an illness if you feel that way is destructive. People are very helpful and a 2 or a 1 isn't a healthy way to live. You have to live your life how best you see fit and whatever makes you happy is cool by me, but I would look at seeing how you can work at cranking that scale up a bit.    Thanks! I'm taking it day by day to work towards that. And I'd love some recipes, thank you. I enjoy cooking when I'm clear headed it's just motivating myself to get up and do it that's the issue.    I think that's fairly normal behavior for everyone, though there are others who could probably answer that better. But as I've said throughout this AMA, if you ever feel hopeless or unsure about that stuff, see a professional. One session can work wonders, even if it's just stress getting you down.    Oh I laughed my ass off. It's absurd. Don't be sorry.    Haven't ever heard of that. Will look it up. Thanks.    Right now no, but we'll see where I end up.    Yes it does, but it's also nice to have a reminder, Thanks!   I have not but am starting to do research into it.    Thank you!   Came close a couple times actually. How does it feel knowing you're going to miss everything cool and die angry? Never mind, you're way to clueless to be that self aware.    I'm sorry to hear that. I was a sick kid a lot and I can't imagine getting to that point.    Very True  	43
 So I've just finished watching Ao Haru Ride and loved it a lot, although I wish the romance had been more pronounced in it. I'm just really in the mood to watch a solid romance anime that isn't too old and has a really nice story like AHR or Sukiitte Iinayo.  I wouldn't mind something with a bit more comedy either, like Lovely Complex (one of my absolute favourites!). I guess the most important criteria here is romance, and not just wishy-washy romance, but actual solid romance...something to make my heart race! :)   OMG I've just finished watching all the available episodes of Ore Monogatari and I love it!   I've just finished watching Shinsekai Yori for the second time and I can't help but feel blown away by it. At once, I feel very subdued by the dark themes of the entire anime, but at the same time heartened by the ending and Saki's will to change her society for the better.   It's such a chilling anime, and I don't think I really understood why until now. Ethics are such a vital part of human society, and the way they are warped in SSY really made me question not only ethics as they stand today, but also as a system of thought. Essentially, I guess it made me really start to think about why certain things are bad and some good. At what point should we assign 'rights' to something? Are only human beings really guaranteed rights?  I guess that's the reason I love this anime so much. I'm so fond of deep thinking and turning difficult questions over in my mind. Each shocking twist of the plot jolts you out of your thinking and seems to make it all the more real. 'What if such and such really did happen?' 'What if that was how society really is?' It's a philosophical and emotional rollercoaster and I simultaneously loved and hated that.   I'm curious as to what other people felt when they finished SSY. Did you start questioning the nature of the world like I did? Or, was it a purely emotional story about children growing up in a post-apocalyptic world?   Also, I'd love to discuss some of the broader themes of SSY...like the bombshell about the queerats at the end, or the nature of children's rights and such...so, GO!   That's fair - I really like anime like Shigatsu, so it was pretty addictive for me :3  Maybe try one or two episodes. It was a little bit confusing at times so I could understand that :D  	4
 Yeah, you might wanna get that changed out or something. But mine cost about that much. Where i live, generally the type of jewelry will determine whether it costs 35, 45, or 55 dollars for the piercing. I dont think you have much to worry about other than the fact that you have a hoop in instead of a curved barbell..   A complisult?    Your third paragraph makes a lot of sense. And I definitely understand that. I'm just saying I've had a realllyyyyyy hard time getting a word in about my experience as a lightskinned mixed girl, and I think that our group could benefit from varying perspectives, because I've seen other mixed girls be shunned like I have in other settings. I never even suggest that my experiences are as severe, and in fact I acknowledge it. It would just be nice for someone to know that there is this problem of not fitting in with the black community or the white community, which to me is a little ironic.   Also, about the bisexuality piece, it's funny that you mention that, I've experienced that too actually! I am bisexual. Thank you for posting this, everything you said I've totally been able to identify with.    Thank you for posting this!   Exactly. It's really hard though, there isn't anyone else who seems to have the same experiences and all of the light-skinned people in the room introduce themselves as "allies." It's so difficult when I'm met with so much opposition and people just laugh at me and brush it off, and when I'm offended, I don't have a right to be offended because they think what theyre doing isnt really damaging and that I'm being a baby.       So, I'll start out with saying I'm part black (from my mom's side). I can pass as white, but people mostly think that I am hispanic.   My whole life, my mother was the one who was there for me and raised me and taught me about racism and oppression, as well as helped me through bad racial experiences. For example, in fifth grade, I got microbraids and a girl in my class scoffed at me, told me they were ugly, and that they were for "real" black people.   Now, I've tried to get involved with Black Student Unity on my university campus and I won't lie. The questions they asked me and the things they assume are sometimes just as ignorant as when white people come up to me and start splurting out random racist bullshit. The black community likes to say "So how are you even black? Which side is it from? Is your mom light skinned or something? You're not really black, you're mostly European." And then the kicker, "You're not even that black, you probably haven't even experienced much oppression and racism." UM, hello  And it makes me super uncomfortable and angry because I do mostly identify as African American. I'm not saying I don't have more privilege, I definitely do and I won't deny that my experiences might not be as extreme, but that doesn't mean my experiences should be brushed off. There are many ways to be black and the black community is not one lumped together homogeneous group.They also criticize me for dating a white guy, saying if i were really black then I'd want to date a black guy, which is SO. STUPID.   THEN, there's the white community, who I'm not "white enough" for. I get told I'm "exotic," I have to basically argue with people to convince them that my mom is black, but then they tell me that I'm not black enough to fully identify as a black person. But obviously I'm not white enough to identify as a white person either, so what am I supposed to do?  Anyway, I could go on forever about it but I really needed the black community at my university because it's predominantly white and it would have been nice to hang out with people of similar cultural background, but they weren't accepting whatsoever. Does anyone else who is multiracial experience this?   Please take that out! Like /u/daveoldham131 said, it's way too deep and if you leave that in your nipple is going to swallow it up. Research some good piercers in your area, and have someone take a look at it. They'll probably tell you the same thing and tell you where you can go from there.    That's actually what I thought at first, but I originally had jewelry that was too small, so i developed pockets on either sides of my nipples that now stick out, so they look too deep but are actually at the base of my nipple.       Anything that ends in "...for a girl."  Hey, you wanna see how hard I punch...for a girl?   "When can we go again?"   Right, and that's really good, but there are forces that will try to make you feel guilty for being who you are other than religion, too. Sometimes when you're young and you discover these things about yourself, you get older and it tires you out that people constantly demand that you explain yourself when you shouldn't have to. I know that in my experience, I grow weary of the prejudice, even as I learn to stand up for myself. And the worst part is that it comes from people a lot of times that you've known your whole life and that you're really close to.   You should also know that sexuality is a fluid, dynamic thing, and it changes and grows while you change and grow. It's okay not to be able to call yourself one thing, or discover that you think you actually might be more of one thing that another. There are a lot of people who are out there who will call themselves your supporters, yet you feel judgement coming from them because they believe that you are free to do what you want and have your own preferences, but you must choose an identity and call yourself that. That's something that will be really hard as well, people who don't understand that it is okay to be in a constant state of not knowing.   Well usually identifying as bisexual means attracted to both males and females , but pansexuality is not limited to just male and female. Pansexuality means you are attracted to male, female, and even more complicated combinations of sexualities and gender identities than that, like transgendered people, and so on. I know that it's confusing, but some people don't even just identify as one gender or the other, and some people have had sex changes, or are going through hormone replacement therapy. Pansexuality covers that wide range.     I say good for you! I didn't realize ( or come to terms with, I should probably say) my sexuality until this past year, and I'm 19 going on 20. I'm glad that you can be sure of yourself so young.   If I had to give you any advice, I would say be strong and keep going on being confident in knowing who you are. Don't let anyone tell you that youre wrong, or that it's just a phase. I had the feelings that I feel now when I was a young child but coming from a Catholic upbringing and being told homoerotic tendencies were a sin made me stuff that part of myself deep down. I still feel a little guilt about it.  Also, you might end up finding out you have "friends" who can't seem to accept that part of you. It's going to suck, but you have to be prepared to explain things you shouldn't have to to people when they find out, like "no, I'm not half gay and half straight" or "no, I'm not greedy." That was the hardest part for me, telling people that I wasn't going through some "crazy college girl" phase and that it was a legitimate part of my identity.            Turns out this photo is not of the user in the title. Doesn't matter. Whoever this guy is, he's hot.          That is really hard. It's so much better to do it as soon as possible, in any case. She's also got the support of her family around, and she's soon going to go off to do new things and start a new chapter in her life. Hopefully that will ease the pain a little, for her, and for you.   I just have to say one thing, if your therapist has diagnosed you with something you don't think is true, please get a second and third opinion. She is going to treat you based on what she thinks you have.   Also, if it's possible, it might be a good idea to seek out a different therapist. Your therapist isn't supposed to bother you. Your therapist is  supposed make you face uncomfortable things, but is not supposed to bother you as a person. You know what I'm saying?   Yeah it's American :)   JC Penney, actually!          In the second picture, you look a lot like Helena Bonham Carter!   Beautiful! Haha and don't worry, I stand that way all the time too.     	29
       I look up at a light source at say pineapple and my urge to sneeze is gone.   He looks really regal and in charge. What about captain, King/Prince or Sargeant (Sarge for short)?  	4

 Yep. I use the Ewok companion in The Old Republic and she is vicious.    Of course girls who like light sabers are a thing.    Ewoks are kind of brutal little murderers though.   Doesn't Christianity teach unconditional love? I wasn't raised Christian, so I can't be sure, but every time I see something like this I'm all "Aren't they supposed to love you anyways?"   These are guys I poundsurfed ages ago. Let me know if you want them. :D  Shadow Gelert falangical  Striped Zafara Haynelle with zapped Pirate Mallard  Grey Grundo MallowBelle      That doesn't add up. If you were my husband, and I really preferred you be home, I would come get you myself.   Hopefully this will "jumpstart" some new changes. I was on hiatus for two years and NOTHING CHANGED. Two years!! How are you supposed to maintain a userbase like that?  I feel bad for the people who lost their jobs. Hopefully it was only the bad apples, not anyone who really contributed.   I know that feel bro. HAIL SOUTHERN.   Are you in the US or Europe? That will help us narrow down which programs are available near you.  In the US, generally your bachelor's will be in Anthropology.   What a magical family moment that I guarantee will not be brought up repeatedly at your wedding.   The only thing that bothers me about 'pre-Clovis' is that the nomenclature presupposes that these earlier occupations eventually became the Clovis culture when they have just as much possibility of being something else entirely.   Stone tools didn't necessarily have a long life, no, but I like to think that if someone broke their big lovely spear point that they might reuse part of it as, say, a hide scraper. :)   Cahokia (and all other Mississippian polities) lacked a system of writing that we know of so *technically* not a civilization (although it meets all the other criteria). I tend to leave it at complex society and call it a day. There are many problems with the current definition of civilization, especially the implication that cultures that don't meet the criteria are 'uncivilized.'   The person who wrote that article knows jack shit about archaeology.  It is an intriguing find, however.   I am an archaeologist and my boyfriend and I have talked about getting tattoos on our ring fingers for when we are not wearing our rings. I definitely don't want to damage mine while working!   r/highschoolproblems   Yes. Do this.   fuckfuckfucfuckfuckfuckfuck   I'm considering the same, so I'm just gonna lurk here lol.   I vote for infected ingrown hair too.   Move relearner would do it I think.   I'm playing Pokemon Green now. It's hard because it's in Japanese lol.   CM says yes!  Now I have hope! I think I might get a new camera. We only have two park days, so $169 for pics makes me sad when I can get a new camera for that money, take my own pics and ask CMs to take pics of both of us.   I will not have Memory Maker though. I had been under the impression that you didn't need MM for these meals because the photos were included in the price.    Hi everyone, I have a couple character meals that traditionally include photos (whether you have MM or not) and I just read on a different forum conflicting reports about whether they stopped this at the beginning of the year or not. The ones I have booked are Akershus and Star Wars Galactic Breakfast. I'll be so disappointed to not get photos. :(   Huh, I didn't know that! Thanks!   Snap is the game I always wanted to play as a kid. Finally got it and a used 64 a couple years ago and was so happy.   Someone above said you could get the R/S one on the WiiU   Sadness!   Blue table FTW!  I never beat HAL's top score lol.   I would so buy a Gen IV pinball game!    Yeah it took up premium space in my case lol.   The rumble on my cart stopped working. ;_;   The gameplay is very similar. The graphics, 'mons, and physics are updated of course and there are a couple more things to interact with on the table. Also Spoink shoots your pinball so you can control the speed of the ball, something which the original version lacks. Two thumbs up can recommend.  Does not rumble though. :(   Mine too! I saved so much for it and loved how it vibrated.  Actually I may have more hours on Diamond now that I think on it.  But back in the day, definitely.   Blue table for life.      Awesome :)   Wow how is that even legal?   The whole website was broken. I bet they are not all gone.   Mine is showing up in MDE now yayayay   I wonder if the poor cast members were all dreading today.   I got mine for when I wanted, but it's not showing on my reservations. I too am believing that my confirmation email means I am good!   If I was the random lady, I'd check the item in my trunk and try to contact the owner if the instrument had any contact info on it.   My boyfriend and I are going for our first trip together in May! 3 (70 days!!)  We are staying at POP Century and checking in on May 5th. Our first night there we are having dinner at Boatwrights at Port Orleans Riverside. Following that, my plan is to head over to the Polynesian for a Lapu Lapu at the Tambu Lounge while we watch Wishes from the beach. Then back home, since we have an early day the next day!  May 6th we have booked the Star Wars Galactic Dine In Character Breakfast at Hollywood Studios for 8:25 AM! I am SO EXCITED about this! My fastpasses for HS will include Toy Story, Tower of Terror and Star Tours. I'd also like to see the Indiana Jones Stunt Spectacular and MuppetVision 3D.  We are then park hopping to Epcot where we will drink and snack our way around the world showcase and flower and garden festival. Hopefully we can also ride Spaceship Earth! We have dinner reservations at Akershus after which we will find a spot for IllumiNations. RIGHT AFTER IllumiNations we will beat it to the Monorail and head to the Magic Kingdom. Hopefully we will arrive in time for Wishes! Seeing it from the Monorail height is pretty awesome. Finally, we will catch the Electric Parade then call it a night.  May 7 we will get up SUPER EARLY for EMH at the Magic Kingdom! I plan on filling myself with Mickey Waffles at the POP restaurant. Then we will try and get to the park in time for the opening show! My plan is to FP+ Peter Pan, 7 Dwarves, and Buzz Lightyear. I plan to head to Space Mountain first thing, do Buzz, then turn around and do Pirates, Haunted Mansion, then spend most of our time in Fantasyland getting all the major rides. We currently have lunch reservations for Tony's, but I am crossing my fingers I will be able to get Be Our Guest tomorrow! We will finish our day in the Magic Kingdom with the new Fantasy Parade.  After that, we will head back to Hollywood Studios! We will do any shows we missed the day before, Rockin Rollercoaster, Star Tours AGAIN! Then, we have dinner reservations at 50's Prime Time Cafe after which we can hopefully grab a seat at Fantasmic! Then finally we will head home and get to sleep in a little hehe.  May 8 we have a late AM breakfast reservation at Olivia's at Old Key West. Then we will take a boat to Downtown Disney where we will look around and shop. We have a late lunch reserved at Fulton's and dinner reservations at Raglan Road. We also have tickets to see Nightwish and Sabaton at House of Blues! :D  May 9- Checkout day. :( I want to walk over the bridge to see Art of Animation and have breakfast or lunch there before we leave.  We are celebrating our 1st Anniversary as a couple and are so excited. 3   Absolutely. Although, I must say I only use Photoshop/Illustrator/InDesign out of the suite, so I can only comment on those. I was working at home on a magazine layout for work recently and the XPS navigated the file better than the 6 months old 27 inch iMac I have at work. I missed the big screen though hehe. I have not tried processing HUGE raster files with the XPS yet though. Just edited a batch of photos here at work and the response time was great.   I got it directly from Dell and upgraded the solid state to 256 mb. I have 8 gb of ram and the i5 processor. No touch screen. It's my first PC after being Mac only for 5+ years and I am very happy.   One looked like an abrader to me.   I do a lot of Photoshop/InDesign etc. at work and have downloaded CC for my XPS and the first thing I noticed is how FAST the programs open up. That's the solid state! I have never had my fan kick on when using the Adobe suite (yet). My fan kicks on only when I am using almost all of the CPU power.   In the US, most archaeologists have an anthropology degree because pedagogy over here follows Boas and the four fields approach.   So none of those look Paleo to me. They look Archaic/Woodland but it really depends on the part of the country they came from (context context context!) See if the historical society or one of your professors will help you get it recorded in the state site file. Or even better, perhaps there is a nearby professional firm that can help get it recorded.   The thing is, the actual stuff you found may be cool and all, but it's a lot more useful to the scientific community when we can study the relationships between the artifacts and any features that may have been present. Remember, you can't put it back once its excavated!   Mine does it (ordered from Dell) but the fan only kicks on when I'm gaming, and I tend to have a headset on so I don't really notice it.   Actually not funny.   Nice   Starting Wednesday they will be taking lunch reservations for BoG. You should give it a shot!  	55
 When I worked in a bakery, we always used a water bath and baked them between 250-300F. Never had any problems with cracking.     I'm 24(f) dating someone 36(m). Nothing wrong with it. Two consenting adults dating is a very normal thing.     I've been a coffee drinker for awhile,  but am just starting to really get into coffee. I have a Chemex pour over that I enjoy, but still purchase ground coffee from local coffee shops. I saw on the wiki page that Hario was mentioned as a good under 50 grinder. I received the Hario MM2 http://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B004QWMAII/ref=mp_s_a_1_4?qid=1419718375sr=8-4pi=AC_SX110_SY165_QL70 for Christmas.  Will this work for a pour over,  or should I exchange it? Thanks!   Received a Kindle Fire HDX for Christmas from my parents....I can't change the background because it has ads.    He won't let us go to bed without one last kiss right before falling asleep. And first thing in the morning I kiss him.  I love that we start and end each day with a kiss.    Lady shaver here.  When I first started I did short strokes and took it slow,  especially around my knees and ankles. But now I find that I can get a good shave with just 1 pass ATG on my legs. I do one long stroke to shave the length of my lower leg, and one long stroke to shave my thighs. I still tend to do short strokes on my knees because I have a tendency to cut myself there. I love my razor and I'll never go back. I've never had as close of a shave as I do now.    How does this shit work? Are regular Starbucks employees expected to perform cream art in peoples drinks? Is this difficult? I don't get it. Seems like a huge pain in the ass, day in-day out. Even if this is an indie place or something, do you charge more because goons expect you to draw shit in their coffee drinks?  I worked at an independent coffee shop for a while and started teaching myself how to do latte art. It isn't difficult, just takes time and practice. We weren't required to do it, but did it because it was fun, competitive with other baristas, and made the work day more interesting. Most customers don't expect it, but it's great to see the smile and surprise on their face when you hand their coffee to them. No extra charge.  It doesn't really take any extra time. You need to pour the milk into the espresso anyway, why not do it in a fun way. :)   Wow. Someone seems to have a stick up their ass. The food industry isn't for everyone, and obviously you aren't cut out for it. Some of us do enjoy the long days and take pride in what we do. Some culinary schools are a waste and some are actually really good. It's amazing networking, it gets you in a kitchen cooking faster than working up from a dishwasher to a chef, and you can be introduced to so many more techniques and varieties of foods than working in a restaurant because you aren't limited to just the theme of the food at the restaurant.   Love that you're watching Gilmore Girls.   Same. I get that it sucks to have someone steal your clothing, so I always return hoodies, hats, etc. Typically the guy is so surprised that I'm willing to give it back that he gives me one for keeps. I now have a shelf full of basketball shorts, tshirts, hoodies, and hats that are from exes.  I don't tend to wear them unless it's a sports team or something that I'm into.   That's how I love mine. I put them in a crock pot with some butter, mustard,  and some seasonings.  Let it cook on low for a few hours. They are nice and tender but not mushy. So good!    Mod Podge is typically a waste of money.  Use liquid Elmer white glue and water. Do a 2:1 ratio.  Mix well. Several art students and craft store employees have encourage people to use this cheaper method that works just as well.   My first DE razor was a schick krona and I loved it. I just bought my little sister a Parker 29L for Christmas and although she hasn't received it yet, it does have a nice long handle that gives a good grip.    Awesome!    Fair enough.    Nice. I've been keeping my eyes out at garage sales and estate sales too, just in case there is anything good.   I've seen a range of prices. At this same shop they had a gold razor that looked like a double edge, but only had one edge to it and had little comb things sticking out - it was about $20. They also had some travel ones with a case and other little things in it, but were upwards of $30 so I passed on those.   Thanks! It's the second razor I've purchased. Both have been at antique stores. Unless I'm specifically looking to purchase a certain razor, I'll probably just continue purchasing randoms at antique stores and other resale shops. Seems to be the places to get the best deals :)   I used a toothbrush and some soap to do the initial clean, some scrubbing bubbles, and then rubbing alcohol to kill anything that was left.     It adjusts the blade so you can get a more or less aggressive shave.   If you don't mind me asking, what settings do you use?   Looks like I'll have to play around with it :)   Female here who doesn't shave her face. I'm assuming same thing goes for legs and such. :)   Thanks!    Will do! Thanks :)   Awesome advice! Thank you :)   Thanks :)   Thanks!   I've never used a razor with adjustable settings. Where is a good starting point?  	28
 My dad was in the living room. I walked right past him and then slipped quietly out the door. Three hours later, at about 4:30am, I walked back into the house and passed my dad again. He looked at me and said, "Hey, you going to bed now?".  It was then that I learned that my parents really don't give a shit.  	1
 The only person in the world who compliments me is the gay local baker who gives me free bread. I'm straight, but I'm perfectly ok with him hitting on me. Everyone else should be the same.    I'm more concerned that they didn't just ask YOU.    He looked down. I saw him.  The bastard.    While it's really nice to have some people saying we look attractive for once, I can't help but notice that all of the attributes described are of men that are basically models. That's fine - models are attractive for a reason - but I think it's interesting that females are born with their most attractive sexual features (breasts, hips, etc) and improve upon these by building various muscle groups/maintaining a certain level of body fat, but men are largely born without the muscles and more importantly the substantial self-confidence that is critical to the perception of an attractive male. These things need to be worked for. I wonder if that has contributed to the current dating system of men approaching women, who then appraise their value and accept them - being undeniably in control as the gatekeepers of sexual intercourse in our society - rather than the other way around.    While that's all very true, I personally would categorise makeup and clothing as (albeit very important) external modifications which are to some extent masks, whereas exercise and building muscle is changing your actual body.   This is important because a man with a sexually attractive body is attractive all the time, and knows he is - whereas women who feel that they are only attractive with makeup (despite the fact that they're probably fine without it) can become very dependent on it for their self esteem and feel uncomfortable or exposed without it.    Well that's a poor attitude    I think it should be pointed out that no one should now refer to men as 'males.'   I think it's interesting that women are largely born with their looks, and other than staying skinny, can't do that much to change them. Men, however, can all physically (aside from their face) be attractive or hideous based on muscle mass, body fat etc.  Furthermore, as girls are born with their looks, if they've been skinny all their lives they haven't really worked for it at all. They are just innately attractive, and I think that must affect their self-esteem and -perception quite a bit. Men, however, must work hard to be attractive. This also extensively applies to their attitudes and their confidence - women's personalities usually come as at least passable with no effort at all.   Off to /r/fitness with you!   Eat carbohydrates. Lots of them.   Out of curiosity, why are you being downvoted?   About 70% of my friends are female, including both of my best friends.    Depends where you live. Usually only the major cities of various countries.  See if your city has a subreddit.    Potterghost's post had nothing to do with this.    Just because a mental illness is being treated doesn't mean that it instantly goes away, or that its symptoms don't manifest.    As someone with a diagnosed mental disorder, we're not all bad   Mods should sidebar this forever. It applies year round, not just to New Years'.   Unfortunately, I don't have a Labrador. So not really. But thanks anyway.    Labrador = laidbrador   I am a singer. You need to be even more careful that you're not forcing yourself to sing out of your range - especially below your range, which is much harder to tell than a cracked top note - because of the greater forces involved on your vocal cords and surrounding muscles.    Because he's being downvoted and does have a relevant point (which he presented in the wrong way), I will repeat it here.   THIS ARTICLE IS NOT ABOUT ARTIFICIALLY CHANGING YOUR VOICE. THIS WILL DAMAGE IT.    whip your shirt off and it's no big deal  Only if you're skinny and muscly.    birth control  The risk of deliberate pregnancy here is extreme.    you and her will probably grow apart  And that's exactly what she's afraid of.    The worst is trying to slim down and bulk up. I hate being overweight but (or so I've been told by several females) my body will be worse as a stick than a bit fat, so I can either bulk now and put on muscle while still having a poor body and a terrible opinion of myself, or I can slim down to a point where I'm happy with myself but no one else is, and then start the long process of improving while taking the unattractiveness hit.    I get the impression you're not really a fan of anything. Maybe that's why you have no success with women.    Knee is being an entitled dickhead. Ignore him, you have just as much right to offer your opinion to further the conversation as he does.    Just because you're offering your opinion doesn't mean that they can't continue the thread with theirs.    But your headshots are amazing.   ... you could be a porn star   Hey man. I'm in the same place as you and currently working on it, and I'm much happier for it. Have a read through /r/confidence, /r/faimprovment, and /r/seduction and see if there's anything that encourages you to work on your confidence - unfortunately the only person who can improve that is you, but I know you'll feel better about the whole world if you do. Just my two cents.    "And lo, the Lord did inherit the looks of Mary, who was but a HB3, which explains she was still a virgin."   If you don't define 2.5 to 7.5 as 'much larger,' I think you need to reconsider some statistics. Such as the fact that the average penis is between 5-5.5 inches in length.    Sidebar please?   scalete  Escalate   Seeing as this post is about calibration, it might be worth adding something to start to explain why you pursued an aggressive approach based on your initial calibration of the situation.    Twist: he's Barney Stinson   It's also showing that you have value to other women (I forget the exact term), which instantly gives you much greater value, because if you dodge that question then you're either sleeping with lots of other people or you're an AFC. And she can't get the AFC impression from the 'alpha' personality he has displayed so far.    What in hell have you the impression that social interaction was fair for both genders?   2-3 times bigger is still a lot. For a guy that's 2.5 inches flaccid - pretty small - he'll be 7.5 in no time.    Ok, thanks for clarifying. I had meant that exchange to be via text when planning the date - perhaps as a reply to "let's meet tomorrow at (bar)" for example - does this change anything?   This may be a really dumb idea, but after attempting to make plans with a girl, if she responds with 'is this a date?' could you say something like 'do you want it to be?' - to indicate both that you want it to be a date and gauge her level of enthusiasm/attraction to you? Or would a more direct approach like a straight up 'yes' be a little more... alpha (for want of a better word?)   And then link them to it every time it's the only appropriate answer to the question.  If we added 'Girls: it is okay to ask out guys' to /r/askmen, and the list of typical body language for when girls are interested in guys to /r/askwomen, reddit's traffic would decrease so much the servers would actually work.    I highly recommend posting this to /r/seduction. They'd probably sidebar it.    Definitely. Look up, find someone you like, make eye contact and smile at them.   If he doesn't come over he's gay or married.    Upvoted as a guy with no male role model who didn't know other kids got taught this for free.    I don't suppose you're African royalty of some kind?   Hey look, it's that time of week again!   Seriously, can we sidebar or FAQ this damn topic?   How old are you? It could be an age/maturity thing (their fault, probably age related) or you could be becoming complacent, unexciting, or unattractive in the relationship.   I would think that using dishonest or sleazy to describe 'nice guys' is probably a bit over the top. Perhaps misguided or misunderstanding what women actually want/find attractive.    Everything about you and your username drips with douche.   Are you familiar with the Dunning-Kreuger Syndrome?   Breaking news - people of the same gender don't necessarily like the same things!   daDAdadada   Hey man, welcome to reddit.

RED ALERT  ASSASSIN IN THE BUILDING   I thought the point of this thread was that the perfect pickup artist didn't exist. Then you go and show up.    Absolutely. 'You should be wearing makeup,' therefore if you're not wearing makeup you're not good enough, so wearing makeup makes you innately acceptable and comfortable.    I think women use makeup as a social and self-esteem prop - it makes them feel better, and they feel exposed without it - just the same as many men do with alcohol or hair gel. They feel lacking or less than their average selves without it as a shield.

You're ready a lot braver than 99% of your country, please stop fighting each other and focus on coming home.    Relevant noob question: if there is a girl who I am not interested in initially for whatever hypothetical reason, and I become friends with her instead but then become interested later on as I get to know her - having displayed no attraction and made no moves up to this point, and assuming she has displayed none of the same - could I then display interest, escalate, etc etc and her actually be interested? Assuming I did everything right and that she hypothetically found me attractive enough when we first met that if I had put the moves on it would have worked, would a few months of friendship forever close that door?   In all seriousness, have you considered depression? (Do you have any reasons to consider depression?)   What could possibly go wrong?   Not sure if sarcastic...  	67
 i just feel like i can't distance myself as he comes to the house all the time    i have finished my studies but have become ill and can't work. my sister is very religious just like my dad and she sets rules in the house and even my mum is scared of her. my brother is also religious but very laxed.    theres a lot to say so i will try to say all the information. i don't even know if this is the

my childood was pretty perfect and nothing bad happened. my parents were married but divorced when i was about 17. my dad was a sikh but converted to islam to be with my mum when they were both at school.   my mum started to distance away from islam and is one of the reasons why they split up. my dad got more strict. my mum no longer believes in islam.   i started to have doubts about islam at a different time to do with my mums doubts.   i moved away to go to university and felt conflicted because i wanted to date but felt like islam didn't let me. i started to move away from islam a lot. i became very westernised over a couple of years. i lost my virginity at 21. when it was time to move back to my parents city after finished university i confided in my dad that i had met someone and wanted to see them and maybe move in with them. he was a white non muslim and my dad freaked out. what then happened is i ran away to be with this guy. things settled then my family and parents visited me. my dad straight away told my boyfriend to convert to islam and have a islamic wedding. he didn't want to do that i didn't want him to do that either. we had only been living together for 5 months and known each other for about 8 months. the relationship ended for different reasons.   2 years pass and i get a new boyfriend. he is also white non muslim. i don't move in with him and take it slow. i think he is an awesome guy. i find out through his Facebook that he has extreme anti muslim views and is a member of the uk group edl or english defence league. i like an idiot tell my family and my dad finds out. everyone freaks out. my dad over speaker phone shouts that he is going to hurt my boyfriend and that i need to break up with him and stop seeing him. i shout some hurtful

months after all that happens. i move on.    i used to be very close to my dad and we had a lot in common. we both like the same tv shows and movies as we are both very geeky. we like the same type of stand up comedy as well. my dad used to really support me and i looked up to him.    the thing is since me moving away from religion and having boyfriends my dad tries to control me. when i was young he ripped off a good charlotte poster off my wall for having eyes. i used to be a goth and he would tell me not to wear certain clothes because it was promoting satan. i had a skeleton necklace and he tore it off my neck once. once when i was 13 he hit me really bad with a flip flop because i was making loads of noise in the morning and he was sleeping because he had done a night shift on the taxis.   ever since the age of 17 me my brother and my sister would see him on saturdays and get picked up in the car. we would go to the cinema or go to a restaurant and it would be our dad time.   i had facial piercings when i was about 18 and my dad hated them. said i looked ugly.   i became vegetarian when i went to university and when he was shouting at me on the phone and threatening me and my then boyfriend he said something like 'this is just like the time you had the goth phase or the vegetarian phase'    in the past my mum said to him to not mention islam in front of me because i don't believe it anymore and he still did. he went and bought me a book on islam.   ever since the phone call shouting I've been avoiding him. i don't reply to his texts. i haven't talked to him in 2 years now. he keeps wanting to sort things out and fix it but i don't feel safe around him and i don't feel like i can be myself around him.   i am now in a new relationship with a white non muslim athiest. i consider myself agnostic now.   i live with my mum and brother and sister. my dad lives on his own.   i managed to block his texts on my phone but i ended up getting a new phone. my brother ended up telling my dad my new number and has started texting me again. i want him to say sorry but i feel like i don't want to bother with him anymore.   my sister and brother want me to talk to my dad again. they still see him weekly.   when my dad comes in the house i stay upstairs in the bedroom and avoid him. he doesn't come up stairs.   one time i was going out and my dad saw me, he said hey. i said hey. then i just got out of there. i was panicking. I'm scared he might attack me because I'm so far gone from the little girl he used to know. i feel like he doesn't know me anymore.   my dad and my mum no longer talk to each other unless its an urgent matter with there children.   my mum re married a white non muslim and hides it from all her relatives.    should i try and talk to my dad and sort things out? twice before we have had bad arguments over the same thing.   should i keep avoiding my dad?   what else should i do?   any questions you have or advice will be helpful.  i know I'm going to get lots of hate.    i also like to add that my dad has a bad temper and used to beat up my mum when they were together. he said he would break my then boyfriends fingers.    theres a lot to say so i will try to say all the information. i don't even know if this is the right sub reddit to write this in. this will put me in bad light but i need all points of view.   i am currently 27. i am a woman. i am british. i was brought up in a sunni gujarati muslim household. my childood was pretty perfect and nothing bad happened. my parents were married but divorced when i was about 17. my dad was a sikh but converted to islam to be with my mum when they were both at school.   my mum started to distance away from islam and is one of the reasons why they split up. my dad got more strict. my mum no longer believes in islam.   i started to have doubts about islam at a different time to do with my mums doubts.   i moved away to go to university and felt conflicted because i wanted to date but felt like islam didn't let me. i started to move away from islam a lot. i became very westernised over a couple of years. i lost my virginity at 21. when it was time to move back to my parents city after finished university i confided in my dad that i had met someone and wanted to see them and maybe move in with them. he was a white non muslim and my dad freaked out. what then happened is i ran away to be with this guy. things settled then my family and parents visited me. my dad straight away told my boyfriend to convert to islam and have a islamic wedding. he didn't want to do that i didn't want him to do that either. we had only been living together for 5 months and known each other for about 8 months. the relationship ended for different reasons.   2 years pass and i get a new boyfriend. he is also white non muslim. i don't move in with him and take it slow. i think he is an awesome guy. i find out through his Facebook that he has extreme anti muslim views and is a member of the uk group edl or english defence league. i like an idiot tell my family and my dad finds out. everyone freaks out. my dad over speaker phone shouts that he is going to hurt my boyfriend and that i need to break up with him and stop seeing him. i shout some hurtful things at him on the phone. he says he is going to get his brother and him and beat up my boyfriend. i say that i am not going to break up with him. things settle down. the boyfriend then dumps me 2 months after all that happens. i move on.    i used to be very close to my dad and we had a lot in common. we both like the same tv shows and movies as we are both very

 So there is a song called I want to get better by the Bleachers-Jack Antonoff side band he's also in the band fun. It's a song that I can relate too   My favourite performance of hers is probably Veronica Mars. Second is House of Lies. Her character is the only reason why I watch the show.     So why is it that you always play characters that always get in the way of the shows main love interest. For example you play Noel in Felicity who was in the way of Felicity and Ben and now in Scandal with Olivia and Fitz.    Glad to hear!!    Talk to your doctor. If you have been feeling this way for a while it could be. I have been feeling really down and I knew I wasn't my usual self since November then a few weeks after in Nov my sister told me she was engaged I didn't feel anything and thats when I knew I needed to speak to someone.    Tell someone about what you went through   In all honesty when I think about the future me, I can't picture myself getting old. Keep your head up high kid you're only 18, you can do it   I have depression, the illness makes me feel empty, I used to enjoy skiing and other activities but I have lost interest in some activities that I used to love doing and everything just feels grey to me. The illness makes me feel alone because not many 21 have depression thats why I hid it with a smile. I don't know if I answered the 3rd q right but it made me open up more about my depression an what i've been feeling inside.    We all wish we were something else. I wish I didn't have depression, but I can't do anything about that prevent it from happening because it already did. My point is, I don't know what you're going through fully but I have two good friends that are gay males and whenever someone saids ''Ugh thats so gay'' I want to slap the person because there is NOTHING wrong with being gay. The internet can be a cruel place for anyone. Unfornately, there isn't much you can do to decrease the negative comments but there is a great quote from 50/50 the movie "You can't change your situation, the only thing you can change is how you deal with it''. There always going to be people that have to bring people down, but you just have to tune them out. As long as you are happy that all it matters. Who really cares what a stranger thinks, because the last time I checked their opinion is irrelevant.    The characters, the storyline, the directing (won't be a good movie if the camera is very shaky etc) and most of all the script. If the script is shit most likely it will be a shit movie    He needs help, there is nothing wrong with that, but people are afraid of being looked differently or don't think they need help. It's really up to the individual themselves. It took me a few months to finally get help from social worker and the doctor. The move is not easy, trust me but once I did it I feel a lot better and I'm more open about my depression now. Ask him maybe how's he feeling or how are you. I mean this is a tricky question because everyone is different. I would definetly try to push him into talking to a social worker but that's definelty not a easy thing to do. Good luck!     I think about this on a constant basis. Everyone thinks about their funeral, but if you think about this often and when your alone it could be because you're  depressed. Don't worry you are not alone. I think and picture my death right in front my eyes. I picture people's reactions on Facebook and who would show up at my funeral and what would they say. You are definitely not alone. Find something that you can distract yourself the second you have those thoughts. For me, once they appear I try to shrug them off.    I agree, laughing helps. No one would think I have depression because I'm always laughing but that is what helps me distract myself. Yes it only for a few seconds but those few seconds help   state of play   She should speak to a professional. Is there something that you and her share? Like old memories that you shared together in the past you should bring it back. Maybe you and her did something in the past that you guys stopped doing like going to a certain resturant or a certain area and maybe bring it back?    Watching Movies/TV is a good hobby. I find it a great way to distract me from my problems and stress. There are a bunch of good movies/tv shows that are out there. If you need any suggestions let me know    What gets me out of bed which sometimes takes me while like an hour. But every week I have one thing to get me through the week. Could be something simple or something special that you don't do much. For me, I love movies/tv is really the only thing that keeps me going. I have a few shows to look forward to for each week. Have something like maybe a bubble bath or something that you don't always do or something special that will get you up and also look forward for the week.    sliver linings playbook     Last year there was two movies with the exact same plot but different names/characters about the White House in danger. It always happens   Sounds like a good plan    To be honest I probably would.    They don't need to make them period    Iron Man 2 was the weakest and most disappointing out of the 3 movies. I would of given Iron man a 60% because Ironman 3 was so much better than the second one. Ironman 3 has a 78% while Ironman 2 has a 73% so there is only a 5% difference between the two films. I would bring Iron man 2 down because it wasn't great. I think Iron Man 3 should be higher up.    So what I loved about Frozen is it was different from the previous movies. There was no prince charming and no princess live happily ever after with a minus bump on the way. It was about two sisters which was nice to see. I think the music made the movie even better because the songs are so well written and so catchy. It's a no brainer that Frozen won 2 oscars for best animated and best song.    I like superhero movies, but I hate how Fantastic Four is getting a reboot. The movie isn't that old, its unnecessary reboot.    Thank you I appreciate it    I know it may sound crazy, but I think about how my family will react to my death and how people will react on Facebook and how people will be crying at my funeral being all shocked because no one would expect me to be depressed because im always ''happy'' all the time. I picture my funeral and I'm not even 21 yet.    Jamie Foxx as the president in White House Down   Way Way Back, Easy A    Pitch Perfect   I started to be a big fan of his work when Sliver Linings Playbook came out. I liked his other film the Fighter as well. American Hustle was an okay film, a lot of hype unfortunately the movie did not live up to it    This will be terrible   All the time   The best and my favourite-Sliver Linings Playbook    rotten tomatoes   I told my doctor. This only happened once, I was really scared. She moved me up to 1 and half which I think is 15mg.    i liked how the movie told Olives point of view plus there was a lot of funny moments in the movie that i loved and after watching the movie  i wanted to see it again     sliver linings playbook 50/50 easy A   So it's going to be three weeks this week I believe that I've been taking cipralex to help with my anxiety and depression. My doctor told me it takes about three weeks for the meds to work. Today my suicidal tendencys/thoughts have increased to the point where I was tempted to put my hands on my neck which I did but I stopped myself then I saw a cord and I visualized the wire wrapped around my neck. I know it sounds really crazy, but is it normal for meds to increase the thoughts because I was told after 3 weeks I would notice a change     	39
 You boyfriend needs to understand that sexting is pretty normal nowadays. Unless you're Amish of course.   Also, just because you send pictures to someone doesn't mean that you're 'asking for it' which I feel like is basically what he was saying.   I think the issue of you forgiving yourself has to do with your first sexual experience.  I don't know if this has occurred to you but you were raped.   You didn't want it, you said so out loud, but he did it anyway. Just because you didn't physically try to stop him and just because he was your boyfriend doesn't negate the fact that someone had sex with you against your will.   I think you need to seek out counseling to deal with that trauma and I think you need to explain to your boyfriend that you need his support in this.    By all means, text him.  I guarantee there is cell service in Vegas so no communication from him is not acceptable. Let him know that you are unhappy with him for the silence and he should at least be checking in with you at the bare minimum once per day.   When he returns you can have a longer conversation with him about what the trip was like and find a way to move past any uncomfortableness you have with things.   For now, try not to yell or scold him, just let him know you expect to hear from him.    Yes absolutely take his offer.   It would be one thing if she was just someone he dated or hooked up with while you guys were broken up but given her history and the fact that she's still trying to sleep with him even after he made it clear he's not into that (since he's back with you) she has to go.  Honestly if I were him I would cut her out anyway regardless of what you said. She is dangerous to your relationship and disrespectful towards you as well.   As for dealing with the jealousy you're just going to have to talk to him. Ask him to be honest with you about what happened between them and ask all the questions you need answers to. And going forward tell him you need to know anytime she tries to contact him, even if it seems innocent at the time.   And if he's comfortable with it, ask for open access to his phone. Just know that if he says no to that request it shouldn't be a deal breaker.  You are both still allowed privacy.   Do your best not to obsess over it. You guys are back together and he's serious about it. Just look at what he told her when she contacted him.  Trust him, it seems like he's doing the right thing.    Start making plans just for you.   Tell him 'Tomorrow morning I am doing 'this' if you want to come let me know'  In your head, plan on going alone to do whatever it is.   You've indicated that you're ok with small changes so if he decides to go then that should be fine. But at least this way you have a plan and you follow through.   Additionally you should tell him why you're changing your SOP. Let him know that his avoidance of committing (either yes or no) is draining and you aren't going to be relying on him for that anymore.    Your parents were fucked up when you were growing up and did a horrible job parenting you.   That is not your fault.   It's good for your sister's sake that they've improved but I guarantee that their improvement had nothing to do with her. Just like their complete lack of responsibility had nothing to do with you.   Their actions are not any value judgement on you or your worth.   It's natural to feel the way you do I think. You've been traumatized and you're having to deal with it.   For your boyfriend I would suggest finding some good reading materials on supporting people with depression. A quick google search of that phrase finds a few good articles and there's probably some more in depth literature available.   For you, just make it clear to him that the way you're feeling isn't because of him. He is not causing your depression. He also can't fix it. What he can do is be there for you (ways for him to do that are why he needs to read up on the subject).   As others have said, you need to seek out counseling. I know it's difficult. Hopefully the idea of insurance through your school pans out because you need some help to deal with what you're going through.   I know there are a lot of people here who are willing to talk (like me) but I feel safe saying that most of us are not trained professionals.    You lied to him for a period of time and that was fucked up.   But the only thing you owe to him for that is an apology and the truth which you've already given.   You don't owe him a relationship, you don't owe him surgery.   If he really wanted to be your friend or have a relationship with you he would try and forgive you and move on. Instead he's holding it over your head by saying you 'owe' him something.   You need to cut ties with him. He is a selfish person and not interested at all in what is best for you.    I wish I had something super helpful to say but I think a lot of it has been covered already (therapy).   I can say that you and your wife don't need to worry about your son's potty training.   I have 2 daughters and my first daughter potty trained in about a week (minus overnights) at 2 years old. My younger daughter didn't finish until she was 4. It's totally an individual thing and also has to do with how uncomfortable they are sitting in soiled clothes.   My younger daughter has no issue sitting and continuing play in her wet pants so it took awhile to get things to stick.    What's killing me is that what I'm going through doesn't feel normal.  My wife doesn't give a shit about me anymore, she's not going through one of the toughest times in her life, she's already moved on.   And the fact that she can drop me this easily makes me feel absolutely worthless and doesn't really inspire any kind of confidence for my future.   I know even if I could meet someone right away that jumping into another relationship is a bad idea I just wish I had some hope that I could find one sometime in the future.    You say you have a successful career so tell her you're seeking therapy to better deal with job related stress.   I don't know any job that doesn't involve stress and generally the more successful one is, the more stress there is to deal with.   I understand you not wanting to hurt your wife and if you feel like you can't be honest then joint therapy probably isn't the best idea now.   I will say that you need to find a way to communicate how you're feeling to your wife. That's something you could work on with a therapist though, I'm sure.    I forgot to mention, I'm in therapy and I am currently taking medication.   At best right now I feel ok. Not great, just ok.   The past few days I've just felt worse and worse.    My wife came to me at the beginning of January saying she wanted a divorce (married 9 years, together for 11).  I wanted to try and work things out but she was not at all interested.  She was convinced that we would never work out and didn't want to 'waste her time' working on a relationship that was destined to fail.  I was already in a depressed state and this did not help things along.  I ended up checking myself into a hospital for most of February.  During that time she did basically everything she could to abandon me.  She never visited, didn't bring our kids to see me, she only called me once.  I found out after I was discharged that she started a relationship with a coworker while I was hospitalized.  Now we barely communicate even though nothing has been finalized.  We are working out a custody agreement but it's not finished and we haven't even discussed dividing assets other than cars.  She's totally moved on with her other guy and I feel more and more lonely every day.  I'm sure that dating someone else right now would be a bad idea anyway but I'm feeling pretty hopeless about my future prospects.  I've never been great at meeting people in general and women in particular and between work and being with my kids I don't know when I'd have time to anyway.  I'm not an incredibly social person.  Plus, I feel like I am a really bad dating prospect.  I'm 33, soon to be divorced, I have 2 kids, suffer from depression, I'm employed at least but by no means am I wealthy, I'm probably about average in the looks department.  I just keep looking into the future and seeing me alone and it's really hard to keep positive about anything right now.  I'm cross posting this to r/Divorce because I don't know how much of this is normal end-of-marriage feelings and how much is my depression talking.

What you need to do first is figure out where you want your relationship with your wife to go.   Do you love her? Do you want to stay with her?   I think loves takes many forms. Maybe you love her most for how she facilitates things for you, that's not inherently wrong. As long as you are fulfilling her needs then your relationship can work. If you want it to.   If you decide you want to stay with her then therapy is a good idea, for both of you. Tell her that you're happy with things but there's always room for improvement. Talk to her about your goals and her goals. Figure out how to best fulfill her needs. Communicate!  If you don't want to stay with her you need to tell her, and soon after you decide.   BUT, don't use the attention you're getting or the relationship you have with this other woman influence your decision. Sit down and decide solely on the relationship you have with your wife.    Well, without hearing from her we can't be sure of her motivations.   I choose to believe that during their breakup she realized that she would rather be with him and chose to come back.   I think if she was really treating him as a 'back up' then there would have been more stringing him along going on. As it stands, when they broke up, they also broke contact.   Maybe I'm wrong though, maybe the other guy she was dating dumped her and that's why she came back.   Either way it happened though she still didn't deserve to be cheated on.   Edit: Also, I can't fault her for breaking up with him when she did. She obviously knew things were headed towards engagement and decided to end things before that happened. If she wasn't sure of the relationship and her commitment to it that was the right thing to do.  It's going to suck either way but I'd rather that happen to me than to actually make a proposal and be shut down. Or, have her say yes because she feels pressured in the moment and not really mean it.    You're a giant jerk. Whether you wanted to break up or go on that break doesn't matter. You guys weren't together and she dated someone else. That's life man.   She eventually realized that you were what she wanted and came back to you. That's awesome.   And then you go and cheat on her as part of some ill conceived payback?    If you were still really bothered by her dating someone else while you guys were broken up then you should have sought out couples counseling before now.   I guarantee that you sleeping with someone else would never be a therapy that someone would suggest.   Honestly it would be best for her if you guys just went your separate ways, she deserves better than this.   If she's determined to stay with you then you guys MUST seek out counseling. But your number one priority should be coming to the realization that what you did is wrong and fucked up.   You need to apologize and do everything she needs for her to feel better about things.   	15
 Reminds me of the Emma Stone .gif   no you didn't.       Haha suicide jokes! Grow up   Where did he ever say he wanted them "off the Internet" I believe you're talking about Beyonce.   Alright bring on the downvotes, I'm just so fucking tired of people believing everything they see or hear on the Internet. He wasn't 2 hours late, it was 40 minutes. He didn't "insist on playing video games" when he woke up either. And even if he did, he's fucking human for fucks sake.

 I put it in my diary at a particular time, and treat it like a doctor's appointment. Once I'm there it's all good, I just get on with it. I don't think about whether I like it or not, I just go. I usually find it a good break from the stress of work, and I try to give myself a mental break from thinking about work, so it turns into a more positive experience.   How was it?   I don't quite get cover letters. I have a feeling most employers skip straight to the resume. But you don't want to be that person that looks like they didn't care enough to write one.   I feel like it's like putting those edible flowers on desserts. I don't know if you've ever had a dessert with edible flowers, but they  don't taste like anything! At least the pansies I've had don't. So pointless, just decoration.   Then again, maybe it's to show you can string coherent sentences together in English.    Haha... thanks :)    Thanks! :)    In Manly, I like 4Pines but I don't know if they're really a brunch place. They do have a view of the water behind the ferry stop. The food was surprisingly really nice, and the beer was also top notch.  A lot of people have told me Garfish is good but I've never been there. I'm not sure I'd classify it as a brunch place but it might be good for lunch.  Besides that I'm sorry I don't know cafes/restaurants in that area all that well.   When I went to kiama we went to the markets. There was one on Saturday   on Sunday! They are actually pretty good - different from the markets in Sydney because they are larger stalls and they have different stuff - not just stuff imported from China. I recommend the Kiama Seaside Markets if you are there.   http://www.kiama.com.au/see-and-do/markets  Aside from that all we did was go to the beach. It was pretty relaxing.   I love running!!! Except I got a stress fracture in my foot from running too much only on weekends for sport and not enough during the week (so didn't build enough muscle strength). Then after 5 months of waiting, I thought it was better and ran and it was the best... run... ever... until a day later when it hurt like hell and the doctor told me I'd fractured it again. I can run again now but having a bad foot put a lot of pressure on my other foot and I got a heel spur on the other one. So now I can't run without being in pain. I tried taking a lot of neurofen but after un-recommended prolonged use it really does mess with your stomach, so I can't have it at all anymore.   So in summary, I used to love running. Now I can't love it because it hurts too much. But I still go, only I can only run properly on grass. And when I do I feel so free!!!  Nowadays I usually ride my bike. But if my feet aren't too painful I can run every second or third day and then ice my heel afterwards.  The other problem is I usually only like running at night, by myself, with headphones in, in the park - the perfect target for criminals.   To be honest I think I exaggerated how much I like running... I think I just miss it because I can't do it whenever i want. But I really did only like the healthy feeling afterwards, where your whole body feels energised. I like running to music though because I can try to keep the beat. I also like sprinting... I get a kick out of it.    ~~Jamberoo is a little bit of a drive from Kiama~~ (oh correction - it's only 15 minutes... well, it seemed like a way away!) I drove past it last time but we didn't want to leave Kiama so gave it a miss. Is it worth it? I've always wanted to go there, mainly for the waterskiing. But then sometimes I think maybe I should just hire a speedboat and take myself on a river.   That's ... not well thought out!   Oh yeah, there is that lol. I just figured you wouldn't go visit that before heading out on a long drive, but you could if you wanted to!   Oh. Sorry. Basic comprehension is not my strong point.   As long as you follow it up with "cause I'll do all your shit for you!" Then that'll be sweet    Are you in Sydney? Depends how far you want to go. I'm in the inner west so usually hang around Glebe or Newtown. If you want more of a seaside thing you could try Bills In Bondi but actually there's a lot of great places at Bondi. I prefer sitting at the cafe down on the waterfront so you can watch the waves and surfers. I also like Bronte but there's only like 2-3 cafes. Another thing I'd think about doing is Yum Cha. There was a discount voucher on Groupon for Emperors Garden in Chinatown. http://m.groupon.com.au/deals/sydney/emperor-s-garden-seafood-restaurant-1-1/719919595 I eat there regularly and I like it. In the city if you like simple food you could try Jamie Olivers cafe but it's a little on the pricey side.   I'd second going the whole way in a trip. I also don't think you'll have 1.5 hours in stops because there's not that much to see on the way. If you have a second driver you can do a couple of toilet stops and have a single longer stop for lunch or dinner.   True unless they lose an eye. Gotta watch out for eye loss.    Yeah I also find this article a bit empty. I would think a discussion about the pay gap by both occupation and years of experience would be more insightful.    I've had plenty of guys offer to shake hands with me in formal situations. It's not weird to me at all.    I've driven in Vegas and around there. It was great. I'd recommend it actually. The roads are fast as they're in the desert. Worth renting a nice car for it and bringing some good music. I loved it. Also, take water with you and pay for the insurance.   I'm heading to San Francisco tomorrow but we looked into cars. If you plan on staying in the city centre keep in mind parking is really really expensive. Actually could cost more than the car rental. I feel like it's not worth it.  Also if you drive in LA get a good GPS with lane guidance. The highways there have six lanes and exits on the right and left. So you can potentially enter traffic from the right, cross 3-6 lanes, exit on the left, then merge with traffic on your turn. That was my first experience and quite scary. Driving in the US after that was easy. I only experienced that in LA though.    But yeah generally the roads in the US are pretty good to drive on.   You should just make yourself familiar with the 4 way stop. First time I got to an intersection like that I was pretty confused... even though I'd read about them first.   Also I learnt that outside Sydney servos aren't open all night. Lucky I was hungry for a late night pie or else I would've run out of fuel. Apparently other people have told me that everyone knows that... seems everyone else except for me knows that.   By the way, thanks for the chat. My sleeping patterns are all out of whack. The daylight savings time change isn't helping either!   Oh that is good to know about Copper Mountain. I heard the name on TV while here but that's all I know about it.   Yeah the beer here is pretty nice actually. I didn't know Colorado was into craft brewing but it's pretty sweet to try the stuff here. Unfortunately I didn't try too much. The bus back from Aspen to Snowmass is deadly to weak stomachs as one poor sod on the bus and all the rest of us found out. What I had was wonderful though.  We put our house buying plans on hold for this trip. The property prices in Sydney have spiralled out of control so we sort of gave up for the time being. When I get back I think moving out of my tiny unit into something more liveable might have to be my next goal. :)  So happy to hear I'm not alone in my goals. Except opposite countries... you know what I mean...   Oh by the way. In my (completely biased) opinion, our coffee is also usually better. It's the only other food thing I really miss.    Sounds nice. I just wanted to go snowboarding over here before I got too old to enjoy it. It was a dream I've had since I was in high school. I planned to go to Canada on a working holiday years ago but broke my shoulder and my plans along with it. I would love to come back in summer. The whole Rocky mountains is amazing. However I may be out of travel money and leave for a while after this trip (no regrets though). :)  If you haven't been to Australia you might find it more affordable now the AUD has dropped against the USD. We timed our trip quite poorly lol.   That's pretty cool. I think that's the main problem when people try Vegemite. They don't know how to eat it and use way too much. Glad you liked it! :)   I do like Colorado. It's actually a lot like New Zealand's South Island but with better snow and more trees and wildlife. NZ has nice lakes though that you can see from the ski fields. I love nature so it's good for me. :)    I did it too and I also felt this way when answering some of the questions. They would lead off previous questions but I didn't feel like the following question was relevant anymore after my previous answer. Crafting surveys is actually pretty hard.    I think I stopped playing games as much when I started working full time. In high school and uni I'd spend hours each week. But now my free time is very limited. So it's more a changing lifestyle thing, rather than being because I gained access to a smart phone.    Haha. That is a very Australian meal! I've never heard of an American eating Vegemite. How did you get into that? Have you been to Australia?   I am in Snowmass on a short visit. Leaving tomorrow to our last stop before heading home. We saved for years to come to the US and Canada and followed the storms here. It's very pretty   the snow has been amazing. The only thing I've found is that I really feel like I don't fit in at  all. But then I think the people here are also not your typical Americans/people. I have never seen so many private jets in one place. I also don't think many of the people here are actually from Colorado. I reckon we should have spent a day or something in Denver but we only went through the airport.   I'm an Australian actually in Colorado. I don't know why but I miss Australia quite a lot here. Maybe you should move to Australia. Sounds like you would fit in well.    I am a female who works in IT. After many years of gaining experience I feel I have much more equality, and I am generally well respected now. I do feel on par with my colleagues.  But I truly believe this might not have happened had I not worked for a federal government department with intake quotas. Their policy is not to employ 50% of each gender, but for a graduate year to employ the same proportion of graduates by gender. So if in 2015, 20% of grads were female, they'd aim to hire 20% of their intake as females.  It's a little simpler for graduates though. It's even harder for companies to find women with experience further along in their careers also because many are also not given the same career advancement opportunities once initially employed.   I'm glad to say that was not the case for me though, and I owe quite a lot to equal opportunity and gender equality programs, along with a lot of hard work on my part in overcoming these issues.    I've claimed using the CBA credit card with Zurich too. They sent a letter after I sent in the claim to ask for more details (it was a theft) but once I replied by email, they paid my claim. I always use it now. Just be sure to see what you need when claiming. I had to spend a day at a police station to get a police report about the theft... which was a little tricky with the language barrier.   Just need to read the PDS cause you have to book with the CC, but they've changed it now from a percentage to a minimum dollar amount. I think it's $1000 now and your partner should also be covered. Not hard to spend that when travelling from Australia.    I know I'm just some random person on the Internet but please don't give up. People do shitty things because they're imperfect, not because you do or don't deserve it. I know what it's like to care about someone and get shat on. It's terrible, gut wrenching and soul destroying. But you're still important and I hope you will give the world another chance. I hope you will get through tonight, then tomorrow, then the next night. And I hope sometime you will see that your life is worth it.    I haven't heard of that podcast before. What is it about?   It's really tough making friends and meeting people. Most people are up for a quick conversation but then go onto continue their daily lives. I guess you just have to go through meeting a lot of people before you meet one that you click with. It gets sort of tiring though I've found and unless people are kind of forced to be around me, like if they work with me, then it just doesn't really seem to take off.   8 months is a little while. Do you still keep in touch with your old friends? They sound fun :)   Sounds like an interesting job. I do consulting so am often at clients by myself. The worst is traveling alone and eating alone. I usually turn on the TV just to hear other people talking. I think it's worse at night.   How long have you been there for? My stints are usually only a week at a time so not too long.   Hi. Sucks being alone sometimes doesn't it :( What are you doing there? Did you travel for work?   Seems like going out in Sydney and enjoying life is banned these days.    I'll keep an eye out at Snowmass. I hope you get it back!    I'm in Montreal today and there were a lot of delays from here and long queues waiting at central station. Not sure if it's related.   I would have thought a zebra would have been a better choice for a bar code animal talking about vegetarians.    I guess it must be easier to clean. I see them all the time nowadays.  I'm not really a fan though. The water does drain toward the wall but I find it doesn't really stay contained. I also like shaking my hands in the bowl of the sink and it's hard when the sink has no sides.    It's all the people who don't like Hersheys coming together. i.e. non-Americans. We don't rub it in your face in person that your chocolate sucks though, we see how happy you are not knowing any better. People on the internet are just more honest. :)   Yeah Cadburys is actually pretty cheap. I think we can get 350g for like $3 here in Australia on sale. Maybe normal price is $5-7 ( http://shop.coles.com.au/online/mobile/national/cadbury-milk-chocolate-block-dairy-milk ). Also the regular plain milk chocolate is now fair trade so even better.    It's like chocolate but with less creaminess and also a bit more cardboard and chalk flavouring. Also it's harder and less melty. Kind of like stale chocolate that expired a year ago.    That's what I thought too. Otherwise Christians would still be required to slaughter lambs to save themselves instead of praying to Jesus who replaced the lambs.   Sometimes I wonder if maybe he just didn't like seeing lambs killed and let himself get killed through a really elaborate story so less lambs had to be slaughtered for redemption. Maybe Jesus was just a simple vegetarian.   I went to one of the Lawsons estate auctions of someone's stuff in Bellevue Hill. Didn't buy anything just wanted to see cause I've never been.   There was a maid... Like she had her own bedroom next to the kitchen and wore the little black and white outfit. A maid!!! Like from TV! !  I also discovered those auctions are good for furniture because people go for the art and don't care about the furniture so it's cheap.    So what you're saying is that it's both adorable AND practical! :)   I love how they are colour coded!   I am one of those people that overanalyses my day to day life and I always feel like this. Sometimes it helps if I lay in bed and think about where I am right now and analyse just the present. It gives me a short reprieve from everything outside of my room and I am just in this moment right now. Maybe you can try it.  Like right now I am typing on an iPad on my bed and the air conditioning is on which I am glad for because i hate feeling sweaty when I'm about to sleep. I'm a little tired and have a headache but I'm glad the day is over. I'm not going to think about tomorrow... Just the next 5 minutes and I'm focused on this message and thinking about how when I sleep my mind will shut down for just a few hours and me and it will have our daily short but very necessary holiday away from each other.   Hugs. We care. I know we are just strangers but I wish somehow we could take away the suffering.  Do you think you can get another job? Maybe something to help you pay the bills?    Hypothetically what would you like your life to look like?   I know the feeling of not being able to get out of bed. It's tormenting because I know if I don't make an effort things will only get worse but all I can manage right now is the bare minimum.  If you take the job and it doesn't work out can you quit? Maybe you could just try it out and see how it goes. Maybe it isn't as bad as you imagine? Is your friend working there?    Go to Target, get a set with a fitted sheet, a flat sheet and pillowcases. 1000 thread count is best so don't bother feeling it just get it. (Eg.  http://www.target.com.au/p/1-thread-count-cotton-sheet-set-white/181097_white )  The Target stuff is good quality but if you want something nicer you can get Vue sheets at Myer that are a bit nicer and don't have the premium of being Sheridan. (Eg. http://m.myer.com.au/shop/mobile/mystore/au-vue-tranquil-300tc-sb-sheet-set-d-19653 ) Though if you want Sheridan stuff and have a car I recommend driving to the Sheridan outlet over near Arncliffe unless that is too far. It's last season stock but still great quality and a fair bit cheaper. With these brands I go for 200- 400 TC. (Eg. http://www.sheridanfactoryoutlet.com.au/sheets/sheridan-300-thread-count-caffery-sheet-set.html ) The honest truth is if you see no difference between thread counts get the cheaper one cause it's probably just wasted money if you don't mind.   Get a mattress protector. Not the waterproof ones cause they don't breathe. Just a regular one. Tontine are good but most are fine.  Get a blanket, doona or fleece. If doona you need a cover. Anything is fine as long as the size of the doona and the cover matches your mattress. In winter the best and most expensive is goose down but it will be very hot in summer. I have different toppings for summer and winter.   Get a pillow. This part I suck at. Everyone likes different pillows. Get a pillow protector. Nothing fancy. The $5 ones from kmart will do. It will make your pillow last longer ie. Not go yellow as fast.   Also don't buy white. Your sheets will look dirty fast.  And don't wash fitted sheets with hot water. It destroys the elastic.  Oh and everything above should be cotton apart from the blanket, doona, fleece or throw (ie. The warm layer). Though a cotton throw can be good in summer as it has the weight without being too warm.  Also don't buy European pillows or pillowcases or decorative cushions. Useless.    I moved out about 22 or 23. It really became necessary when I was studying and working in the city. The 3 hour return commute from my parents wasn't working for me anymore.    Here in Australia I have never used up my sick leave allowance... ever... my boss even let me use it when I got my wisdom teeth pulled which I'm not sure is strictly sick leave as it's planned. It would be against the law here to force someone to come to work when they are sick and have a doctor's certificate proving it. Workers here are entitled to 10 days per year when full-time.   [Identical](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/ed/c1/b0/edc1b0e2431d14eddc848353475d93eb.jpg)   China hates Japan because of what they did in the war. I don't see why they would bother attacking Australia. They can mostly already get what they need from us.   So wouldn't that put Australia on par in terms of progressive-ness? Is there something else as well?    It's like everyone's forgotten that China and Australia fought together at one point.   Not saying we should side again but why do we have to side with anyone.  Japanese leaders weren't completely removed from ruling after the war like they were in Germany. See http://www.crf-usa.org/election-central/bringing-democracy-to-japan.html The current government descends from that... I think China still feels that was not right but had little say in it at the time and will not accept Japan's many apologies while they feel that the same organization that commited what were horrific war crimes against them, are still in power. To understand why China hates Japan look at the massacres and war crimes they committed.  China is growing to a position of power but they have so many internal problems at the moment without involving other countries. They have the power to bully Japan on the side but probably no interest in taking it too far right now.    Sounds like you have a warranty on the battery so yeah this makes the most sense. But do you know someone who can take it out and put it back in for you? Cause obviously sounds like you can't drive the car there to get someone to do it. It's actually pretty simple but if you're not good with cars you might want someone else to do it.   There is a Kmart Tyre and Auto on Booth Street or one at Broadway near the fruit shop. Or I find Glebe Auto Repairs on Bridge Rd cheaper. If you call them they may have some suggestions for getting your car there or visiting you.    I'm curious to know why Australia is considered less progressive? Not arguing either way... but I would like to understand the perception.    I spent 6.5 years at Sydney Uni so ask me anything. But I'm Australian so don't know what it's like as an American. Though my supervisor was from the US so always told me about it.   1) assuming you're coming as an undergraduate: not that many Aussies live on campus. Most commute at least for their first year. Otherwise it should be pretty similar to the US.  2) This is unlikely to be a problem. Sydney Uni is fairly diverse.   3) Depends what you're after and what experience if any you have. If you have an RSA you can try bar work. If you have done some prior study you can do tutoring. You can do babysitting.  The Uni has a casual and part time job portal: http://sydney.edu.au/careers/finding_jobs/casual.shtml You might need to be enrolled to log in.    Reminded me of this guy: http://m.brisbanetimes.com.au/queensland/queensland-man-bitten-by-deadly-snake-grabs-a-beer-20140310-34iik.html   I'm not a parent so I feel rather ignorant. I have a relative whose kid only eats chips and nuggets and it seems rather unhealthy but they have a hard time getting them to eat other foods. I have heard other parents say the same thing about bananas or fruits. Why are kids so selective?    Exciting! Have a good trip!   I like New Zealand but I wouldn't consider it a place to go for job opportunities.    I'm not sure why this was getting downvoted. We are lucky to be in Australia. I always wanted to leave but now having seen a lot more of the world I can't imagine leaving permanently by choice.    Have pity on us who live next to dogs like that the rest of the year. Just kill me...  Oh and you report problem dogs to council.    It was a bit windy today in Sydney! I thought about going out but we ended up just walking about a block. I feel super lazy. Tomorrow I will go for a run!   I think I'm bored, but I don't have the energy to do anything. Maybe I should go back to sleep.   I love Christmas ham.    I have a muslim Jordanian friend and he said the prejudice is way worse there than in Australia. I would have never guessed from my short trip there...   Bundeena to Marley is shortish. Marley Beach is nice.   I suppose it depends on the kind of fashion you're into. Myer and DJs are good for footwear and work clothes. Myer is also ok for casual. If you want gym stuff then Rebel in either mid city or King St. If you want other casual clothes it depends on your tastes. The chain stores have the best sales usually.   You cant skip New Years Eve in Sydney. I tried it a couple of years and it was fine until the party in the city started on TV and then I wanted to be there in the thick of it even though I know all too well how the night is going to end.  (Also dont watch the ABC coverage. Itll ruin New Years Eve forever for you.)  Usually the night starts off great. The anticipation of a great night ahead is building. Depending on what Im doing Ill get dressed up - heels, dress, hair, etc. or in a low key year  casual clothes. Im pretty excited about going out into the city. I try to drink heaps of water through the day to make sure Im fully hydrated and pack the fridge with some Gatorade for later. Im still feeling clean.    Then you might have a drink or two before heading into the CBD. Here youre on the bus or train with everyone else still fairly sober and well-behaved. Everyones kind of in a good mood and it feels fun, since its the end of an old year and you can say goodbye to your loser 2014 self and say hello to your new and improved 2015 self who at this point hasnt had a chance to screw everything up yet. Youre a clean slate, and the crispness of the air conditioning in the train and bus just affirms to you that this year will be different to all the others - youre going to be a new person now.  As you arrive in the CBD and get off the bus or train, you make your way to your 9pm fireworks location and possibly your location for the rest of the night. Sometimes its Darling Harbour, sometimes its Circular Quay somewhere, sometimes its a harbour side vantage point or a private party of a friend of a friend of who the hell knows? Wherever it is, you probably have to stay on your side of the bridge or else plan to stay out until much later than you would ever have planned But right now you just need the best spot possible. The rest is a problem for later.    If youre lucky enough to have found a harbourside party, great! Youre probably in the best position to enjoy New Years. You just need to take your own drinks and youre set. Just wander down to the nearest lookout and then meander back to the house between the 9 and 12. All you have to do is drink, dance and try to avoid getting into any fights.    If you havent found a party which is most years then you probably will sit around getting slowly more intoxicated while reminiscing the last year, discussing any resolutions youre making and waiting for the 9pm fireworks to light up. If you didn't sneak any alcohol past the checkpoint.... sigh. Prepare yourself - it's going to feel pretty drawn out. The same boat with snake lights will go left and right in front of you, but its still kind of nice looking out over the harbour with those lights (as long as its not raining and you don't sit under a tree where bats will shit on you). Try not to get sunburnt too, that kind of puts a damper on things to come.   When the fireworks go off at 9pm youre probably feeling like  OMG Fireworks!!! Ive waited for HOURS and they are the best EVER!! I love Sydney! Yay! By now youre getting a bit tipsy, all the children are running around on the grass with their glow sticks and whirry glow sticks. After that some families head home, others stick it out.  Then you start the long haul wait for the midnight fireworks. How this goes depends a lot on your location and company but generally if youre in a grassed area it involves drinking whatever you sneaked past the checkpoint, eating snacks, talking crap and waiting If youre comfortable and have enough to drink this goes fairly quickly, if youre not its slooow.   Then, at last, the final few minutes to midnight. You can hear the whole city getting excited. This is the part where if you stayed home youd start regretting it. Everyone is excited to see in the new year, people are starting to bustle for a good spot to see the fireworks. Then the countdown on the harbour bridge starts, you can see the numbers light up and everyone stands up at once. The whole city screams out the countdown to midnight and there is this amazing sense of awe along with the collective sound of a few of those roll-out party pipes as the first midnight fireworks bless the sky and make the loudest thunder and clap and crackle, and light the sky with the full rainbow of colours. If youre near the foreshore sometimes theres music but sometimes the sound of the fireworks is too loud to hear it. The sound vibrates inside of you and you can feel the new year start. Whatever the theme is lights up on the bridge, people do their new years kisses, the party horns sound and you can hear everyone ooo and ahh at the fireworks. The fireworks seem to never end. There are fireworks left right and centre and you can see them and its amazing. However you felt about it earlier in the night, the wait was worth it.  When it finally ends everyone yells out to random strangers Happy New Year! as people start to make their way from wherever they are to wherever theyre going. Usually theres some aggressive teenage boys who push and shove and elbow their way through the crowd, like somehow its really going to make a difference, but everyone is in too good a mood/not sober enough to pay too much attention. Most people start to wander off and then you see the huge piles of crap left all over the ground and the poor grass being completely destroyed.   As you leave the space between people gets a little larger. If you decided to go home from Circular Quay via George Street youll have to contend with everyone else. Its like the harbour was a giant stadium with no orderly exit strategy, just a million people who all want to exit at once. Most people are pretty well behaved, but some start pouring out of bars drunk and disorderly and getting into fights. Thankfully theres not the copious amounts of broken glass all over the road there used to be but it can still get pretty gnarly. Its been a while since I walked down the Rocks, but I think itd still be similar.   Ive never caught the train at Circular Quay  it just never works out and I cant even tell how long the wait is because theres just too many people  so usually we start our trek up George Street with everyone else. People at first are fairly orderly, then as more time passes more of the dregs start making their way up with the girls falling over in their less than practical footwear, guys vomiting and urinating and youve got the best seats in the house to the worst show on earth. You probably want to zig-zag up the road and pay close attention to where you place your feet at this point.    Its been a while since Ive gotten the train back from the city - now we generally walk a few kms to get home and if we're lucky we'll nab a taxi. By the time I get home Im either completely sober or feeling pretty ill, though generally I feel really dirty but also dont care all that much because I'm so tired. Ill collapse into bed thinking next year maybe Ill just stay at home mainly because getting home was so damn hard. But as I fall asleep Ill think of the smell, sound and colours of the fireworks and dream about doing it all over again. :)  Another option is to watch the fireworks from a park or location further out of the city. This can be a lot more relaxing, the alcohol rules aren't as strict and there's less idiots around. When you're not keen for the hassle of the CBD, this is usually the best way to enjoy NY's. Just as long as you have a way to get home, preferably walking. The upside of this is you just got to chill out and get home easy, and you will be able to wake up the next morning and still enjoy New Year's Day.   If you want to drink most of the public vantage points around the city areas are alcohol free zones. http://www.sydneynewyearseve.com/vantage-points/  Probably best to try to find an alcohol on sale site on the harbour.   If you have some money to spend maybe you can go to Luna Park - I haven't been so can't tell you if it's good. There's different price tiers though, so I guess depends what you're after. http://www.moshtix.com.au/v2/event/harbour-party-nye-2014/73390     Are you looking for something in particular or just keen for a browse? It's mayhem in the city, so I'd probably plan to visit stores in location order to minimise the time fighting the crowd.    I wish they were still here with us... :(   There's some shops in Chinatown that sell weird singlets/shirts. They probably have a VB one.   It was a really amazing and beautiful gesture to have so many flowers out there and so many people going to pay their respects. And a great idea to turn them into something and save all the notes.  I went there the day before they were removed though, and some of the older bunches were actually starting to smell pretty bad. I think it was good timing to pack them up. If a storm did come through as forecast and destroy the flowers more it wouldn't have been a good scene to wake up to.   If it's raining:  - Chinese/Asian places are usually open e.g. Chinatown, Cabramatta - Some other cafes/restaurants should be open e.g. Lowenbrau - Cinemas - [Sydney Acquarium](http://www.sydneyaquarium.com.au/visitor-info/opening-hours/) - Ferry Ride (if it's not too windy - but it looks like there'll be thunderstorms tomorrow)  Merry Christmas :) Hope you find something fun to do.  Edit: Didn't read the title properly!   I've found that most people I've spoken to don't know the difference between a virus and a bacteria. It seems that it's just not something people learn in high school.    No problem at all! I'm glad you heard my words and that I could brighten your day. :)    I wish I could hug you. You were desperate and you felt like there was no way out. Guilt is a difficult thing to overcome, especially when you feel like it really was your fault. But despite what people say, it is possible to change. You can still hate what you did, but you don't have to hate yourself. You're human, and everyone makes mistakes. You're not the first person to have hurt other people and you won't be the last.   I'm not saying to forget what you did, obviously it is something that is deeply bothering you. In fact if we just forget we don't really learn from the past. I'm saying to separate the act from the person you are. You can be a different person now and perform different actions.   Also mistakes are a part of life. We all make mistakes. Some mistakes feel impossible to let go of. There are things that I deeply regret and if I had a chance I would go back and change it in an instant. But I can't. So the way forward for me is to try not to let it happen again. It may, but at least I will have done my best to try.   What will you be doing in Japan? Maybe the change would be good.   It's difficult when you're unsure of what you want. What are your options? Maybe write down all the things you've thought of doing and the pros and cons of each one and then once you've had a thorough think through, try talking with a friend (probably not your SO or her mum though as it might complicate things). Maybe that will help. It might at least help you clarify what it is about each of the things that you're attracted to and identify what's missing right now in your life.  If you don't have other friends to talk to you can talk to me about it if you want too. I'm all ears :)   Life can be worth living and it's hard to see that sometimes. It definitely doesn't and probably won't feel like that all the time, but hopefully there are parts that make it worth it. If you're not feeling good about not having a job... then the only answer to that is to get a job, even if it's not your dream job.   Right now you're stuck in a cycle. You feel crap so you have no motivation to do anything, and the lack of motivation is making you feel crap. To get out of the cycle you need to start small. Pick something you want to work on, and work on that.   People are giving you pressures because they care about you. But you don't have to listen to any of them, it's entirely up to you. But don't change things for anyone else, change things for yourself - to make you happier and your life better. You can do it, I believe you can!    Sounds like a pretty difficult situation you're in. Can I ask you a question though - what do you want? I hear you say a lot about what you don't want, which is helpful, but what would you like things to be like?  You sound like an amazing caring and loving person, but it sort of also sounds like you've put everyone else before yourself.    You've surprised me because I've been feeling the exact same way.   I was really fit before but I had a stress fracture about 2 years ago and I've put on about 10kg. I waited a long time for it to recover (I think it was 6 months), but I couldn't rest it because my job requires me to move around a lot and carry my laptop around (which is not a lot of fun while wearing a moon boot). Anyway, I decided I needed to run, so I went for a jog one day and it was awesome... I missed it so much... then the next day my foot is in a heap of pain. Turns out I fractured it again. This time I had to wait a year for it to heal.   A lot of other stuff happened in my life. I got married and I was much bigger than I would have liked. Don't get me wrong I'm so happy to be married but it was a very stressful lead up to the wedding. On my wedding day I nearly had coldsores but luckily somehow they went down. I have been in some very stressful situations at my work and it has really made it hard for me to feel positive. I am just so busy I don't have time to think about it most of the time, but if I did I know I wouldn't be happy.  There are a lot of things I don't like about my life. It got pretty bad and I was ready to let go of everything. At 3am I was sitting down preparing myself and a police car drove up next to my car and asked me if everything was ok. I burst into tears and he asked what I was doing and if I wanted to talk about it and I said no I just needed some alone time. He said if I needed anything I knew who to call. That simple act was enough to get me through.   This past year a few people close to me have passed away - one to suicide - and going to the funeral sealed in my mind that I would go through any amount of pain to save my family or friends from that suffering. It has been really tough. This forum has been a place that I have been able to come and talk to people about things and it has made it more bearable. I really truly encourage you to do the same, and if there is anything you need to talk about or just vent then just PM me anytime.  Sometimes life is really tough but you will get through it.   In terms of motivation, after the 4th death of a close friend this year I just couldn't do anything. I stopped doing the dishes, the house was a mess... things just sort of started to fall apart. I went to the psychologist and she asked what was bothering me the most and I told her it was the house. She told me to just pick one thing each day - like say, doing the dishes and do it. Each day has been a struggle but I am slowly getting better. Maybe you can try to do the same?   Do you want it to change?  I guess at the end of the day only you really know yourself. We're all kind of trapped inside ourselves to some extent and it's hard for others to see what we're feeling or thinking.   But it doesn't mean people can't know you to some extent. I'm pretty private but I do let the important people in my life in.   How long have you been feeling this way? Is there something you're particularly unhappy about or just generally feeling flat?   How you feel is how you feel, you don't need to feel guilty for those feelings. Almsot everyone has times when they wish for things to be different.  To me it sounds like you need to keep putting one foot in front of the other and trying to do things that lift you and make you feel like you're taking active steps towards something. Maybe it's something little like going for walks each day or sticking to a schedule, or maybe they're bigger things like changing jobs. Is there something that is most bothering you right now? Maybe that is a good place to start. What do you think?   I was trying to reply to a lot of posts but then my own day to day life   problems get in the way. It's not that I don't want to reply, just that sometimes I am too drained myself to do so. But I would reply to everyone if I could!    I lol'ed at ass o'clock :)   Do you think she left you purely because being a parent was too stressful? I feel like there is probably more to this story than that.   My favorite bags are Coach and Mimco. Mimco bags I only get on sale because they're on sale all the time. Oroton has some nice ones. I also saw some pretty nice ones in Marcs. Myer is worth checking out too. If I want something cheaper then I also look at Nine West although I don't think they're leather.    Oh... really... so I just learnt that "spelt" wasn't used in the US much. I wouldn't have even thought about it.  	95
 because I messed up okay   hmm, okay that's very helpful, thank you for your insight. In fact it's better than most other people who give liek a criticism with no detail.  if they're bi but prefer dating one kind wouldn't that make them either gay or straight? (tbh, I was going to let it pass the bi's since it helps them but the problem is if I grant it to them why not gay or straight and I want to avoid this whole complication)  the main reason I don't think we should just hand out the identity, freely because honestly, people treat asexuality as a joke, not because they might not understand it but it's because of the dreaded SJWs and other fake people in this way: I have seen cases where people claim to be asexual to deny sex (as opposed to just saying no - now I know you will say rape will happen, but it's just gonna get more complicated so it's a completely different discussion). Also people can claim to be anything under the asexual spectrum and we can't say if they're lying or not. Now I'm all for like you can be this or that but they just do horrible things (hypocrisy namely) such that it actually makes groups like asexuals and transgender people look like a joke. do you get what I mean? (think of Westboro Baptist Church onto Christianity, for example)  and yea, I guess asexuals do face discrimination (different word), though and I don't know right now, it's still 'relatively new' (even though 14 years is a lot). There are still a lot of things we don't know yet and this once again is why asexuality (awareness) is very important and I still hope to learn more about asexuality.   I just wanted to vent on this topic  I believe that asexuality is important in many ways. to begin with, it's a nice identity for those themselves that need it. unfortunately, we can't prove who is asexual and some people trend and claim it and might make asexuality look bad (it happens to any group). In fact, I am annoyed that people take the romantic orientations (I believe it was designed for asexuals so that it simplifies things because some asexuals still want to date). Now, as for me and along a few others, we agree that the identity isn't useful for other person to know (unless you are dating) because it doesn't matter whether you are straight, gay, bi or ace because we care more about things like personality (sure your sexuality might have influence but whatever). It is important to note that asexuality is very diverse and each one has different behaviors and stuff: for example, some you will meet will be sex-repulsed, others might not, etc.   so overall forget identity (just keep it to yourself, it really doesn't matter) what asexuality is more important for is the concept of it. It allows room for topics such as kinks (namely BDSM, I believe it's an alternative to sex), polygamy/polyamory, communication, intimacies/touch, sexology (it might sound ironic), aromanticism (these I feel are least understood right now), (maybe) deal with rape, topics and issues like Japan's sexual apathy, and lastly, a lot of transgender people come into the community which is nice and cool, and much more.   lastly, yes, asexuals are not oppressed (not that I am aware of) but the awareness again is not for oppression points but rather for spaces and benefits (and thus asexual awareness is important) for what I listed above.   I never said it was acceptable though, you are just assuming (you people please need to stop doing that), but it will still happen. For example rape, rapists will always exist and rape (doesn't mean we shouldn't raise awareness either, but no amount of awareness is going to stop rape, people learning self defence will) or people will do drugs even with awareness, education and being illegal (intervention and therapy sessions will fix these problems).   What Christianity is not:  -gay bashing -anti evolution/science or creation vs evolution -anti woman -definitely not anti tattoos -not all those things being misconstrued in media  What Christianity is about: -God, Jesus, Holy Spirit (Trinity) -grace and redemption -hope and love  so can we not waste time on creation vs evolution debates? either of them, it( i.e. just assume that creation) happened already, move on and focus on the more important parts like grace. Also, it is okay to ask God questions (or question God).  One of them, an expert in the law, tested him with this question: Teacher, which is the greatest commandment in the Law? Jesus replied: Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind. This is the first and greatest commandment. And the second is like it: Love your neighbor as yourself. All the Law and the Prophets hang on these two commandments. - Matthew 22:35-40   oh okay I guess I am attuned to it, so that's why I am having a hard time understanding. thanks for being the most sensible here and well people talk behind other people's backs as it is. that's just how the world is. take care!   that guy was talking about SRS when I didn't say anything about it   I use you guys as gender neutral and many others do so too, so it's a common practice so it's a subjective argument  lastly, your gender is not the only part of your identity, it's A part (heck I'd rather see past your gender more of your personality, and yes gender can influence your personality)   children should be taught to (almost) always ask for sources or proof (if it's a personal matter, ask the specific person for personal information based matter)  Also teach children to be kind (do unto other as you would have them do unto you sort of morals). As for me, I just don't care (not in the sense I don't want to hear it, just more along the lines of do what you want-provided it's logical) whether another girl or guy does this or that (or not that I wouldn't support them if it seemed appropriate). I would recommend also that people focus on more important matters than trivial things, like whether this person did this or that (please be logical, if the rumor is someone fed someone else then it doesn't apply here) is not going to fix world hunger. (if you're going to argue what am I doing, myself. well I am studying hydrology because I believe having accessible drinking water is important)  ugh, if you are going to criticize me for celebrity matters, it's for entertainment (entertainment is necessary too, and as i mentioned, I like hearing people's stories, maybe they even inspire me but like okay it's not like there isn't anyone who has a new boyfriend every week other than Taylor Swift)  if I missed anything, be logical  honestly, I feel it comes down to being logical or having common sense. I know not everyone will 'be nice,' but if you're not going to do it, nobody else will.  	9
