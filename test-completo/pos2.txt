 prison break  edit: at least the first 2 seasons   "I will find you, and I will kill you"      What did he get you?!   it can be anything from a smell to a movie to your mother in law...   E.T. his entire character scared me. I watched it when I was 6 and cried because i was scared. I haven't watched it since...   You know I've been thinking fish recently.   40 oz. to freedom   wealth does not equal happiness.    "Twenty years from now you will be more disappointed by the things you didn't do than by the ones you did. So throw off the bowlines. Sail away from the safe harbor. Catch the trade winds in your sails. Explore. Dream. Discover" -Mark Twain  	10
 Oops, didn't reply to the second part of your question.  The course thing--been feeling this way since about...April-ish?  And the boyfriend thing--about late June-ish, about 2 months after we moved in together.   Thank you :)  It is nice to talk to positive people.  I'm usually a fairly outgoing positive person, but the last few months have definitely taken a toll on me.   	2
 Pardon me if I'm wrong, I haven't studied Theory intensely in awhile. I believe it's just a color tone, but the bV would make the chord half diminished. You can resolve it the same way you resolve any normal V chord, or use it as the Dominant of a new key.    My gf has wanted this since they announced it.   This is fantastic!   Amazing.   Can't explain to you how many times I've done this...   This is hilarious. Someone needs to make these an actual thing. Only cereal I'd buy.   This sounds like me and my SO, honestly.   I almost forgot to mention that I play a few hours out of the week, but that's because I need to stay on top of my schoolwork. It's tough because I can play this game all day long (as I did this last summer when I wasn't working and played this game for 4-8hrs a day every couple of days or so), but there are some points where I need to go do other things and hang out with RL people.   Speaking of relationships, how goes the positive approach on yours? I hope it's going well.  	8
 I think there's like 7 seasons...   My mind is blown.   construction, delivery men (food and furniture, etc), coutbound/inbound call center or telemarketing. sell drugs, underwear, flip free stuff you see on the side of the road for money, or thrift store flipping /r/flipping   I like answering questions too. I love posting here but don't get many questions. How do you relieve stress/anxiety?   3.   Mturk   Fourth wall?   Meds. They have me a little clearer view, enabling me to kind of "self help" myself how a therapist may.... If that makes sense.  Hated therapy.   3   I was obsessed with coffee, stopped drinking it when I started antidepressants and other pills. Sucked but now I don't drink it at all. Maybe once a month.   And your favorite? Love(d) opiates.   Depression, anxiety, mania. Low social interaction, body issues, abuse, drug use, alcohol use... All at the same time.   Not sure if feasible but my high school sells mattresses for their football team. Big profit compared to candy bars.   Just cut it out. You can do it and won't miss it.  Healthy eating works too (so I hear).   Already on ambien. Tryna get more blown   Humans are so unique! Sometimes killers become monsters in our heads .   Browse reddit. Search for threads about the zodiac killer. I did that the other day and was so intrigued. I just took an ambien trying to get freaky, I hope I can make it past the drowsiness and join you. I've been up since 4am.   Yes. It did result in a relationship which I guess I can't be mad at. He showed me different things and took me on the ride of my life thus far, even though we never really "dated."  Gut feelings hold a lot of importance.   I'm very sorry for the deaths in your family. It's hard but what a blessing to have had them in your life, to make it more beautiful.  It's reddit, time to spill how you messed up. I've been through a lot and I'm not one for preaching, but I do enjoy telling others my experiences and how I look at different situations.   No that's rude as fuck and weird. Seems like she's using you and you're better than that. Sorry. Just an outsiders view.   At least you can feel feelings. Even when I'm ecstatic, I'm not "high."   Ask her out and be a 27 mature kind gentleman and get some ice cream in the park over homemade sandwiches and a picnic basket.   Happy birthday, very exciting but be careful. Welcome to the 21 club, friend. You made it 21 years ;)   Brand new-dj entendu The dangerous summer - reach for the sun Lydia-illuminate   You're in your 30s and live right in the middle of white collar and blue collar. You probably have one kid that you want to be a rock star. And a gotee   You smoke weed but don't do much more, yet you live a respectable life as a productive human being and are empathetic and compassionate to others.    Veggie burgers.   Do you have a dog? Take them to a class or day care and after, talk with the teacher or whatever and ask them to teach you.    College isn't worth it but having a degree is.  Learning is worth it.   Work hard and be nice to people.  My old boss (who was more like a parental figure) used to tell me "everyone has their problems." Not really advice but impactful.   Stolen money/gift cards.   Find Steve jobs and tell him to make the iphone 10.   If you told him a dark secret or something that is heartbreaking to you or difficult, would he try and comfort you and give a damn?    No just do khakis and the polo. Or dress pants with a fun print and cardigan.   Probably when someone dies.    Clients, equipment, a plan of action.  What are you going to do for the dogs and in what time period? Costs? How are you going to promote? How will you "transfer" the dogs? Things like cutting nails have serious health implications and should be learned by a professional prior.   Me too. so much for my one moment of wit for the day :(   Probably Jim Kelly or a famous sport coach.   That there are so many weird hobbies and obsessions I never heard of, and that there are people with the same sense of humor as me out there.. Oh and people are actually willing to share information and help if you ask.   Not unless it's something I may return or a big ticket item. You never know, but food and stuff like that, NOPE.    Bleachers-I wanna get better   The wonder years whole album called "the upsides."   Any update? I can't keep track of new posts here.   Want to date?   I probably have like $1 floating around on that site. I think there's a sub for it... /r/mturk ?   A few things as a manager for a quick service place (and of course past worker):  Don't let this get you down. Yes, it's mcdonalds but everyone has their struggles and although you may not feel anyone else will hire you, they will. You have something to bring to the table, whether you know it or isn't visible yet.  You supervisor shouldn't make you feel angry or upset. It's his job to LEAD you. Leadership is about bringing out the best in people and helping them towards their goals and growing.  If you're not happy, I'd say quit. I know this isn't always possible because of financial situations but sometimes you just have to go with your gut.  Also, I kind of skimmed this post, but I hope you realize there will always be hardships in life and in a career and need to be able to cope and reorganize yourself to work through these issues.   75% off hotels.   I thought that too and considered eating it again. I don't think that's why I'm depressed though, although diet is probably one of my main problems. I bet this is more of a humorous post, but if anyone has articles on depression and meat/non meat eaters, send them my way.   A few other bands posted a video like this, I think they covered a Brand New song, maybe TBS. Anyone remember this or can link me?   Not sure what that means..   I don't eat meat so I'm probably not the best person to ask. What dish is served with these options? Chicken is probably the healthiest, and if I ate meat, I'd only eat chicken or turkey. Lean meat, great protein, plus all the chickens in the world are only alive due to human breeding for dietary purposes, so if you're worried about what is humane, don't worry -- we already ruined the species and I don't think they can become extinct anymore.   My friends 2 year old sibling. So funny.   No but I'll eat anything at any time.   Likewise.   To put story behind the post, I want to get away from my problems, not talk about them.   Or experience any real happiness.   It's a coverup for my inability to connect/learn/make friends with depth... I guess   Namaste   No I do not know how to relax, that's my problem. Why relax when you could be doing something productive? HOWEVER, there is nothing that matters more in the world than happiness, making memories and connections, and learning from others. IMO at least.   She really is a great human. Need to read Amy's autobiography next.   Never been near a tornado, what are you guys doing? Where do you go?   No but Tina Fey's bossypants made me feel feelings.   Stuff from home, your own business. Maybe housekeeping, paperwork, secretary   Message me to talk, I'm on mobile and it's difficult but can help.   But I can't cut it out of my diet =(   Statue of Liberty too.  	65

 I always struggled with not being able to touch myself! It did get worse with a full bladder, and also if I read anything or watched anything was sexual content. The ache would be there, unless I completely forgot about it by doing something else. I'd take photos of myself to please my OH and make him aroused.   Also, cumming without touching is a very tricky skill that needs to mastered!  Good luck!   Elastic bands tied around the nipple for a short time, careful not to leave on for too long due to blood circulation.  Nipple suckers, try getting some suction cups and then play with them when suctioned, should be ultra sensitive.   or if you are my adventurous, buy a milking machine and have your partner milk them! ;)    My partner (23 M) and I (18 F) have been together for 6 months, I am experienced with BDSM and have been for a long time, unfortunately the bdsm I experienced was mixed with abuse and so this does cause problems with kinks..My partner would like to experience things such as threesomes and having someone watch us, however I have bad experience with both of these and so am not so into trying them again. I feel by saying no, I am taking away his kink and I feel guilty for doing so. Does anyone have any advice for overcoming fears caused by bad experiences?  Thanks.    If you have nothing nice to say, please leave! I think the set looked lovely.    I didn't think there were many VS shops in UK either!   UK ladies, where do you buy your lingerie from?   Thank you, finally someone realises what I'm asking lol. :)  	7
 I'm considering getting a snake or a bearded dragon, but I have no idea where to start. I already have a cat and a small dog (who probably wouldn't care that much), and my cat will try to attack everything that moves. I'm surprised she hasn't gotten any of my fish yet, so my cat is a concern. I don't want to get anything that my cat could potentially harm. I'm sure I could find a weight or something to put on the cage, but I'd still worry. Anyhow, I live in a condo and I am gone for school everyday during the school year and my mom works. Our family also goes upstate a lot, sometimes for about a week at a time, so I would need something that would either be able to travel or that would be able to be alone for a few days. So I suppose my question is, what would be better for my situation: a snake or a bearded dragon? Also, if anyone recommends a snake, what kind? Any information at all would be appreciated, because I have no idea where to start. Thanks!3     Hell yeah3   I can't pick just one, but Knockin' on Heaven's door by Bob Dylan is in my top 3. It was played at my father's funeral, who was a huge Bob Dylan fan, and that makes it even sadder for me.   Thanks!   Annabanana_22   please omg    Paper Doll in my ass  ;)   http://imgur.com/viPudkA hai c:   I actually found a license plate the other day that said "GODSTD" and I was considering posting it here   50% Scottish 25% Irish 25% English  Woo   This is why my mother refused to talk "baby talk" to me as a baby. I was also talking in full sentences substantially faster than most babies, whether or not that has anything to do with it.   I absolutely love McCrae and have a giant obsession/crush on him tbh. I actually got really jealous about he and Amanda and I realized I needed to take a step back and reevaluate the fact that I'm getting jealous about a man I will never meet and has no idea who I am. Oh my god.   God this is gorgeous. I love living in Michigan. I never want to leave.   Yeah at this point it should pretty much be underwater-ford   Waterford. Represent!   Just finished that book, my immediate thought as well   You're welcome(:   D'aww you're a cutie :3   Woo! Message me!(:   Hell yeah!   Trombone!3   You get me.   I have been playing guitar for about 3 years, since I was 12. I started trombone in October, and I've played euphonium/baritone since I was 11. I love music, I swear sometimes it's the thing that keeps me sane.      As weird as it sounds, I LOVE your eyebrows.   http://imgur.com/upsFs0L  The top one was from when I was two, circa 2000, and the other two are from now, 10th grade. I was a cutie :3 (btw excuse the no makeup but yeah)   Ouch. I take it you guys are competitive. We don't technically compete, except for at certain parades and invitationals.   Depending on how much we need to work on, usually 2-5 hours. Most of the time it's about 3. 5 hour practices only happen about once or twice a season.   True that.   Before camp it's at 10 am, after camp it's 1 pm, during the school year it's 6:30 pm   I still have school tomorrow :( my internal clock wakes me up at 6, then right when I can start sleeping in, marching band starts. The struggle.   That is a good point. I guess I'm just really bitter about them considering selling it.   If the city does end up selling that art, I'm going to be so pissed off you have no idea. We all know that if they were to end up getting the money from selling the paintings, then in five years they're going to end up exactly where they are now, unless drastic changes occur  within the city council.   You could actually almost put this on r/creepy   I love the acoustic version so damn much.   http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1y-ntX4hXBE Jiffy! 1:16-1:19   Yup, this is it      This is it, thanks!   I'm late, but I got a rather amazing boyfriend ;3   I watched a movie on Netflix a while back, and I just thought about it today. I can't remember for the life of me what it was called. It was about a guy who was a high school teacher or coach or something (if I'm not mistaken) and he has a very sarcastic son. I can't remember why, but the son ends up killing himself and his dad starts going crazy, and I remember at the end he saw his son hanging in the hallway. Sorry for the convoluted description, that's all I remember of it. Thanks!    http://imgur.com/vOq5BSr I'm the one on the right, I promise my teeth aren't really that yellow, just the lighting ;-;   You're adorable awwh   Same problem. I haven't had mine since around November or December. No one seems concerned and say that it's normal. THAT IS NOT FUCKING NORMAL.   Well he's really mean in a funny way, and he said that I should STOP breathing. Like all together. XD   I'm in segment 1. In Michigan you can start it at 14 and 9 months.      Check this website: http://zenpencils.com/ It's very possible, because the art style and context sounds similar to these.   Oh my gosh. The other day my high school had a girls lacrosse game against a school in Detroit, we encountered so many girls like this. They pretty much beat us with their sticks too.   I do water then paste, and no water on top. Maybe I'm too stupid to brush my teeth but when I do it the other way, the toothpaste all globs off.   I'm from Michigan and I definitely suggest filming in Alpena, especially on Long Lake. Parts of the town are gorgeous.   And then that cover is the only one you can find at wherever you buy it from and you look like an asswagon carrying it around? Yeah. The Hobbit and The Perks of Being a Wallflower.   I still wear acid wash jeans. I love them.   It's Franklin Press, not worth a whole lot. Oh well.   Ah, that's mildly disappointing. I'll check when I get home tomorrow.   I'll check tomorrow when I get home. :)   Will do tomorrow   Oh my gosh. Will do tomorrow when I get home.      Yup .-.   And there's the time she referred to my cousin's year-old brother to her "boyfriend" for months   Not super exciting, but I was walking with my friend who had bright orange shoelaces, and Charquise stalks up behind us and screams "GIRL DEM SHOELACES ARE CUUUUTE!" and did this snapping thing with her hands and her posse high-fives her   It's like "Shar-queece" and she used to put liquid lip gloss on as eye shadow and tried way too hard with everything she did oh my god   OH MY GOD THIS IS CHARQUISE I AM CRYING HOW DO YOU KNOW HER. She dated my cousin and was talking about how much she hated white girls right in front of me and was like, "Oh gurl you black in my eyes" I have so many Charquise stories who are you oh my god   Agh, I don't think this was it, thank you though!   I don't remember what site it was on. I played it maybe 4 or 5 years ago and I still remember it for some reason and would love to play it again. If I remember correctly, you were a guy who was trying to stop these guys from robbing a bank. It was a really silly point and click adventure type game. I don't think the art was very good either, it was a bit ms paint-ish. I remember a gas station and the cashier was a hispanic woman I think. The town was a bit ghetto. I don't remember much about it at all. If anyone has any clue what it is, let me know please.   I'm pretty sure this is supposed to be making fun of Ketan Vora   Ahah, no he's my friend's younger brother      Just out of curiosity, is this guy's name Taylor? He reminds me a LOT of someone I know.   I've been listening to this album quite a bit. DAE find it kind of cool how the end of World at Large kind of spills into Float On?   There's a hill behind Durant High School in Waterford that's pretty good. I'm sure there are better but I sled there a lot.  	71
 lol boke   at a [0] in psych lecture   I know that feel bro, uptoked all the way :)   Use a different operating system...   obviously...      I wish more people like you were more involved in bug reports for all kinds of software.   ...Sarcasm?   I am very experienced with Java, and willing to help! Is there a public repository that I can pull from or does one need to be granted push/pull permissions?  edit: Never mind, I found the GitHub repo and downloaded the source code. Still looking for the bug list.   edit 2: Found the bug list. Currently familiarizing myself with the codebase. My username on GitHub is test_subject2673.   edit 3: Working on [#BUKKIT-2181](https://bukkit.atlassian.net/browse/BUKKIT-2181) found the problem in code, will try to fix tomorrow.   edit 4: Working with undocumented code takes a lot longer, there are hundreds of undocumented functions named a() or b(). Doing the best I can though.   edit 5: BUKKIT-2181 seems to be a server-side issue that can only be fixed with a client side mod   edit 6: Commented on [BUKKIT-2193](https://bukkit.atlassian.net/browse/BUKKIT-2193) with a possible fix.   edit 7: after reading through some of the emails I got after signing up for the github notifications, the sheer amount of complaining is staggering   Also if anyone plans on responding, I would appreciate a technical explanation, not a scrub explanation.   Back it up and keep it down until a fix is found... Is there any way of detecting client side mods? How do the nocheat and nocheat+ multiplayer server options work?   This just happened to me 5 minutes ago... I feel like a complete idiot. Same guy too!   I don't have the pair of menus like that on my LXpanel, so I guess the changes won't be affecting me. Thanks for the great explanation :)   Sorry if this is a nooby question, but I run Lubuntu 12.04 (basically ubuntu with LXDE instead of GNOME) and I was wondering if this change would affect Lubuntu 12.10 as well.   Ahh didn't notice the interface part. Thanks for pointing that out.   the palmer squares need to go on tour   Just checked the Java 7 docs as well, was disappointed to see it still there.   there is (sort of): /r/badcode   You're absolutely right about the attitude part. However, the user shouldn't have to choose between familiar/functional interfaces and security (not sure why you called it abstract, do you mean that users aren't aware of how vulnerabilities work?). I use Nightly Linux x86 and first thing I do in the morning is update it, then get on with browsing. If there are multiple updates in one day and it pops up to notify me, I simply press restart to update, wait a WHOLE 5 SECONDS and carry on with my business. Firefox even saves all your tabs for you while you update, so I suppose the point I'm trying to make is why are people so angry about quick updates? My best guess is that the vast majority of users have no idea about major exploits and the consequences of running unpatched software. Feel free to let me know if I'm going in the wrong direction with this though, because what I feel it really boils down to is patience.   "But I WANT zero-day exploits in my browser! WAAAHHHH WE NEED MORE UNPATCHED REMOTE CODE EXECUTION EXPLOITS!" That's all I hear when people complain to me about browser updates.   Came into this topic expecting propositions of new logos and being able to feast my eyes upon new potential candidates...   Platform fragmentation makes it hard to support a large range of devices when developing apps. As an Android app developer, I understand the struggle of maintaining compatibility with older platforms when newer versions of an app can have API-specific dependencies, and therefore hold nothing against Google in the way they've made Chrome available on Android. EDIT: I'm a Firefox user though. Where is my file menu Chrome? I'm still waiting for that option.   AMD procs implement the x86 instruction set in a different way as well, not sure if that makes a difference though.   Great read. I was surprised most by the 1 in 190 initial failure rate of CPUs being higher than the 1 in 270 initial failure rate of hard drives. Did anyone else find that odd?   Serious question: What kind of companies rent that much compute power for 87k an hour (if i read the post correctly)?   Very informative! Malware authors sure are a peculiar bunch...   I love the way you shifted it to minor instead of major (that Rocket Man is in). Great song!   You're right, it was a pretty bad generalization.  	28
 Some films or TV shows. I remember watching Juno a few years back and crying at the end; I don't even remember why. The worst part was I'd already been laughed at by my mum for crying at the end of Breakfast at Tiffanys (who leaves a cat out in the rain like that?).   Community.    Using a throwaway account for obvious reasons for the daily reminders now about payment but want to make sure we can all get along to Newcastle in one piece of paper and I have been together just over a year ago.   How have I never noticed that?? I really need to hit up IMDB more often.    My NSis and NMum do the same. They keep calling FH by his university nickname - he graduated in 2012. He's told them before he'd rather go by his actual name but "That's what he was introduced as so that's what he's getting called."    They're the worst, at least bees have a purpose. I actually passed that exam which was amazing considering the panic attack I had following Waspgate.  	6
 When I reach rock bottom with a depressive episode I find that my social boundaries almost completely disappear. I talk to people I wouldn't otherwise talk to about pretty deep, or personal stuff. It's almost as though I just have to dump my negative thoughts on people close to me, to help me carry some of the weight. Most of the time it's alright I have people who I can talk to but I often have a hard time internalizing those horrible emotions when I'm at the lowest of the lows. Do any of you experience this too?   yeah I understand that completely, I'm 20 and have been called an old soul so many times I can't count it. I'm not a religious person and don't actually entertain the idea of reincarnation, but I've always identified with the idea of having been around the block a few times.    Yeah I did the same thing, it was always trying to push it as far down as possible. I think that by doing so at a young age it actually caused my depression to be worse now. I can remember doing some things in school that were really not alright, and just biting my tongue so I didn't cry sometimes. I've been trying to work very hard at exercising as a way of wasting the energy those negative emotions cause.   I'm really sorry to hear that you have a problem that makes exercising dangerous. I can't imagine how I'd manage without.   Wow that's horrible, I'm sorry to hear it's taking so long. I don't know how I got an appointment so fast.   I've become much more empathetic since realizing I was struggling with depression and seeking treatment. Before that though I was about as bitter and jaded as you can possibly get.   about a week and a half.   Really?, I was diagnosed with major depressive disorder and an anxiety disorder after my first appointment with my Psychiatrist and I'm from Canada.   Thanks a lot for the recommendation. I have to say that now that I know I'm depressed and that I've been seeking treatment I don't feel as cold and jaded as I did before. I know where those negative feelings and coldness was coming from now so I can manage it better. At the same time there is a degree of realism in the way I thought before. For instance most people feign empathy for things happening in other countries, though it is almost impossible for them on a human behavioural level to actually care because they have no invested interest. I guess it's kind of stuff like that that still hangs around in my head, but I've been trying to empathize more as a part of managing my depression.   Oh man I understand where you're coming from a lot. I am absolutely polite and helpful to almost everybody, even when I am having a major depressive episode. People have a tendency to take advantage of me this way. I'm very jaded about almost everything though, politics, philosophy, everything. When you read enough, the world becomes horribly small and rather depressing, especially when you read a lot into sociology and philosophy.   I think that more often than not I'm myself only around strangers, or drunk. Everything else feels like maintenance a lot of the time, I feel like I need to keep a facade to keep friends.     For me it may have very well have been a lot of anxiety I had as a kid. I can just remember very clearly either saying horribly cynical things, or just crying in class. I got into fights every now and then but I never started them. I just remember being incredibly weepy at times, or over emotional. I didn't cause a lot of trouble, but I did and said some pretty morose stuff at a young age.   No it was just about the way I felt about it, that I was pissed off enough about how stupid I felt people were that I felt I had to go talk some sense into the people handing out stickers, instead of ignoring it. Perhaps that wasn't the best example, but I did things like shot people down in class discussions and was just a huge asshole about things. I'm not like that when I'm not in a depressive episode so I was just wondering if other people shared that experience.   I relate a lot to this. I'm not out of the woods, but I've definitely been an ass to people close to me.   My depression has definitely left me a bitter and less empathetic person than I was before I became depressed. I've become sort of dismissive of most things that other people seem to get very swept up in. I honestly have admitted to myself that I don't have the emotional resources to care about what happens in the rest of the world anymore. I know it's not good that there is war in Syria and drought in Africa, but I just find myself not giving a damn. I actually have started thinking that most peoples empathy for these sort of things is just a big show they put on.   For example, with the whole Kony 2012 thing, I ripped into that like there was no tomorrow, being bitter and jaded at what seemed like sentimental schlock. It wouldn't usually bother me, I'd ignore it and let it go, but I actually went to the booth some students had set up at my college and basically drilled them to see if they knew what they were talking about, mostly they didn't.   I don't know, I just feel more bitter, jaded, and down right cynical than ever. Do any of you get the same thing?   I've recently been diagnosed with depression and looking back on my personal history I've been depressed since a fairly young age. Probably since I was 9-10. My Psychiatrist and Psychologist both agree that I experienced childhood depression. I can remember being just randomly irritable at times where it wasn't appropriate, or acting out in other ways. I remember just having fits when I was younger that looking back corresponded with periods of anxiety and depression.    Yeah we've talked about it quite a bit now, and have decided to talk on a semi regular basis. This was her idea not mine, I've already told her I have no idea why she'd want to speak to me again. So I guess that's good, she's the one who is really pushing to continue at least a friendship. Though I'm not trying to use the depression as an excuse, I think it's fair to say that I only ever behaved in that way while depressed, never before or after. She says that it doesn't bother her and that it's nice that there's some explanation there.   Yeah, I went in again to have a visit with the psychiatrist I've been seeing, he was able to better explain what he thought my issues are. I'm still not 100% on it, because I know I've had weird hyper/irritable episodes in the past, but he said most of them seem to be driven by anxiety rather than a mood state. I'm going to keep an eye out for symptoms regardless, and I've been mood charting for the depression that I have been diagnosed with, so I guess time will tell. Thanks for the response.   I often feel that humans live very unnaturally, that humans aren't supposed to live in massive groups of hundreds of thousands. I wouldn't say that I'm a primitivist, just that I feel the way things are set up which is for a maximum productivity society hurts the human mind that it influences. Things like television and consumerism, too much information always bombarding you even if you try to avoid it. Humans are built for living in smaller family groups, not giant grids with thousands. I guess that's why living in an apartment building feels like a prison to me.   Just that it seemed that these episodes were driven more by anxiety than anything else. I made it clear that I felt the anxiety was more of a symptom than a driver, but he said it seemed the other way. I can't see how an inflated self esteem and grandiose thinking could come from anxiety. In some cases I'd agree with him, not so much in others.   Some have an evening, others have lasted about a month.   Yeah I make a lot of comments about my intelligence. Yeah, no one suspected that I was depressed, maybe a bit neurotic, but nothing more than that. I built a persona that was the opposite of how I was feeling, I made comments about my looks and intelligence, and was pretty haughty sometimes. It was all just made up to counter the scales.   Totally agree. I'd say I come off as very high strung and full of myself, **especially** when meeting new people. I figure that I have to come off as a dominate personality as a confident type personality, but it's all just an act, it hasn't done me any favours.   I think we're on the same page, I just took it to a bit of an extreme. I think there's a certain level of depersonalization that goes along with it. I know I just feel like a pit behind the "face" that I put up, and recently I haven't been able to muster the energy to keep it going, and when I could keep it up. When I could keep it up, it would just be the most fake, arrogant, manufactured face you could possibly imagine, as soon as I got home it just disappeared.   Yeah that's kind of where I am. I've just spent a year acting kind of like this without really realizing what I was dealing with.   I've discovered that I show a fake kind of self confidence in an attempt to hide how horrible I really feel. It's almost as though I'm trying to convince myself I'm someone impressive when I know that I'm really not. It sort of happens more often during periods where I feel horrible about myself. I can convince myself to act self confident even though I'm not. It feels like an equal and opposite reaction to the depression, sort of like well if you feel like crap inside act like you're not outside. Actually it's more in line with the feeling, if you feel horrible inside, devalue everything around you so you feel better. I end up being horribly judgemental and condescending.    It's actually terrifying how much like the people in Brave New World a lot of people really are. I'm a horrible idealist who tortures himself with thoughts of "real happiness" or "true beauty." I'm very much starting to believe those things are unattainable and are just fantastic delusions of what's really possible. Off topic, but it does cause me a great deal of strife and unhappiness. I wish I didn't think about these things, I wish I could be content.   Actually I brought this movie to my exgirlfriend, saying how amused I was at the concept. That's when I realized I'd become one seriously bitter, angry, misanthrope, and it wasn't 3 months later that I started going to therapy.   edit: I suppose I should actually reply to your ideas. I've learned not to hate the people who I think are awful and greedy, most of the time they don't know any better. Is it something to lament? yes, is it something I can change? probably not. You see, the world has become a very ugly place, and, I believe, people by and large have also become that way. We live in a world where there are weapons that can destroy whole cities in the blink of an eye. The situation, overall, has become rather bleak, cheap, and ugly, and many people have adapted to reflect this. There are reasons why I find art so lacking in it's ability to provide me comfort or catharsis, it's because there is no group of words, images, or notes that can extinguish the existential anguish that comes from living in our time. A time when everything could be moving toward a hopeful, beautiful future full of peace and promise, but so often falls short of that ideal.  So, while I used to resent those who act horribly or choose to distract themselves and ignore, I now simply lament the state of things.    I used to say even worse stuff, I'd off handedly mention killing myself without realizing that saying something like that is inappropriate. I find that trying to keep a positive frame of mind in general has helped, I don't say stuff like that anymore.    I'm 20 so I've spent some time in university, but all of my professors knew my name in classes of 50-200. In highschool a lot of my classes like Literature, History and Religion were more or less dialogues between me and the teacher.   When I was ten I read the lord of the rings to myself and understood it. I can remember being in grade 6 and reading 1984 by george orwell because I was done all my work. My teacher "made an example of me" and sent me to the principal's office where I then told them I had been sent there for reading in class. I spent the rest of the class happily reading in the comfy chairs at the principal's office. I remember trying to explain the roman senate to a bunch of eleven year olds in a social studies class.   In my highschool years I basically had free roam to come and go as I pleased because most of the teachers knew it was a waste of time for me to actually attend class. I had a real problem with accidentally talking down to people which obviously didn't gain me any friends.   I just don't think that society has the infrastructure to tend to the needs of people with exceptional intelligence. People with higher intellects are usually more emotionally sensitive as well. So when an intelligent child, teenager or young adult experiences the turmoil that comes along with a generally uncaring world they have nothing to truly help or steady them.  	30
 I regret isolating myself from my peers, and not even taking any part in extracurriculars.  Most of the time, I literally went to school and went home to get on the internet, and stayed in my room.  Originally, I was very socially awkward due mostly because of my terrible home life, but was still very sociable.  Just annoying, though.  7th grade was a terrible year, it was my first year at the junior high, and I was quickly learning how cruel other kids could be.  I mean I was annoying, I deserved some of the hate I got, but there were some things that happened that were practically unwarranted.  It was around that time that I moved to my grandparent's house to get away from my homelife abuse, and it just came to me that I was tired of other people.  So very, very tired.  My self esteem was in the pits.  I was tired of being the subject of ridicule, of being a psychological punching bag of my peers and family.  And I knew it had to do with the fact that I was hopeless at social interaction.    I don't know what happened, but it was like some part of my brain just... slowed to a stop when I realized just how shitty everything was.  Some part of me broke, I think.  I stopped interacting with my peers mostly.  I spent a lot of time studying.  I pretty much only spoke when I had something witty to say.  Soon... people started liking me.  My only friend year later told me that someone from one of my classes told her, "test_subject3112 used to be really weird, but she's cool now".  That's right, I was cool because I wasn't an annoying shit anymore and just shut up.  Because of my bad self esteem, this pretty much only reinforced my behavior.  While I did learn a great amount of patience from my actions, it is terribly regrettable.  I developed severe social anxiety because I have worried so much about making myself presentable to others.  I kept silent, I figured shutting up and being obedient and staying out of others way was the best and easiest way to coast through school.  Now it is difficult to be employed, to leave my house, to make friends.  I am anxious much of the time.  I quit my last job due to a panic attack.  Apathy has encroached on every aspect of my life.  My therapist actually told me my depression is worse than my anxiety.  At the time this all started, I could hardly cope with the stress.  I'm thinking it is probably a combination of school and home pressure that caused me to break and retreat within myself.  I greatly fear rejection.  People tell me not to care about what others think, but I have realized from so many years of being alone that people are a part of our lives whether we want them there or not.   *cringe* I checked on the pandora website and the minimum price is like 20-25 dollars per charm...  My grandma got me one of these bracelets with only four charms, so the minimum she would have had to pay would be at least over $100, right?  Now I feel like absolute shit because I literally never wear it.  ):    Perhaps some money in there as well in case of emergency?  It doesn't have to be much, but I've heard it's always good to have some money outside of your wallet stashed somewhere just in case.   Wait there's a neo group on facebook?  Can't you report that person to the group mod for scamming and get them removed?    	4

 Hmm okay, I suppose it makes sense that a 1st party flash works better with the body than a 3rd party would. I guess I'll just have to save for a bit longer.   Thanks, I'll look into it! As for the slave flash, I can disable the pre-flash in my camera, would it work if I did that?   Hey there r/photography. Recently I've been wanting to get an external flash because I feel limited with what I can currently do with the onboard one (I like to do a lot of portraiture). I currently use a Canon 20D and I'm on a pretty tight budget. I was wondering if the [YN-460](http://www.ebay.com/itm/YONGNUO-Speedlite-YN460-Canon-EOS-Rebel-XT-XTi-XTs-/160593250447?_trksid=p5197.m1992 _trkparms=aid%3D111000%26algo%3DREC.CURRENT%26ao%3D1%26asc%3D14%26meid%3D1806658724969685563%26pid%3D100015%26prg%3D1006%26rk%3D3%26) would be suitable for my needs? I mostly do a lot of indoor portraiture.  I was also considering getting a stand/tripod I could mount the flash on (use it as slave). Would [this](http://www.ebay.com/itm/Hot-Shoe-Flash-to-Bracket-stand-Mount-Adapter-Trigger-/220982002387?pt=Camera_Flash_Accessories hash=item33738dc2d3) and [this](http://www.ebay.com/itm/656-200cm-PROFESSIONAL-Light-Stand-Tripod-for-Photo-Studio-Video-Lighting-2m-/290764698956?pt=LH_DefaultDomain_0 hash=item43b2ed354c) do the job?  Thanks in advance!   When I replied to your comment I thought you just were talking about how the original AOKP toggles take up too much space, especially since they can't be hidden in the JB notification shade. I was just saying that there is an implementation that takes up as much space as CM's. The only differing aspect of the appearance that I can see is the lines underneath? Otherwise they're pretty much exactly the same.   http://www.imgur.com/meJ8k.png  ROM control  toggles  toggle style? I used AOKP ICS fairly extensively and I'm 100% sure this is an option there too.   AOKP has an implementation that is identical to CMs, its just a setting change away.    [Why wait?](http://fitsnugly.euroskank.com/?rom=cm10 device=i9100)   Taken on a beach known as "The Spit" in Gold Coast, Australia. 30 second exposure with the Canon 55mm 3.5-5.6 kit lens.       I don't think it could be done with tasker without a reboot. The only way I can see this working is with the Paranoid Android ROM. Its DPI changing interface is the only thing I know that can change from phone to tablet UI without requiring a reboot (it simply restarts the framework-ui, which takes a few seconds)  OP, your best bet is to install PA and just change to the tablet UI when you need it. It only takes a few seconds.   Not the other commenter, but dear god. I hated the snow-only worlds. The second I saw snow I just made a new one. Why was that ever a thing? Biomes are so much better.   I'm fairly sure Android turns off mobile data automatically when connected to wifi, all by itself.   Thanks so much for the update! Another bug that I forgot to mention seems to have been fixed as well (child comments had a huge indent for some reason). I love every bit about this theme, it should be the official CSS for reddit. Congrats on your work.   The result is from WolframAlpha. Makes about as much sense as saying iPhone made your day when you Google searched something funny.    Probably something to do with the fact that the notification shade is always there, while the home screen requires a button press.    Try clearing data for the app.   Pretty Fly for a Wi-Fi   Its a comment, and my original comment talks about being able to edit them. Which you said I could.    It does, OP just doesn't realize that paragraphs require double enter.   Desktop link for those interested: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZeaIvjoH1FY   I'm sure he could, but that does not warrant posting incorrect information. Your post adds nothing to the discussion and shouldn't have been posted in the first place.   You kinda missed out a pretty vital step in your initial comment  initial comment  You didn't link it in the initial comment, like I had said. You only provided a link after I commented, and I'm sure it was only because you Googled the information after you read my comment - something you should have done before posting and assuming OP is stupid and treating him like so.   Why do people constantly try to make out that we're some sort of tight-knit community? Our "reputation"?! This site is frequented by tens of thousands of people daily, and its a total mixed bag. There is no reputation, this does not "have to stop". You're an idiot.   You kinda missed out a pretty vital step in your initial comment. Was the OP supposed to just magically know where to find and download the Android File Transfer application? +1 douche points man. Good job.   Wow not only were you condescending, but you are absolutely incorrect. With 4.0, android devices default to MTP for file transfer, something that osx does not support natively.   How would I go about that? Long pressing the comment only reveals these actions: http://www.imgur.com/SxAI3.png   IMO posting about carriers in r/android makes about as much sense as posting about ISPs in r/windows. It has nothing to do with Android, at its core as an OS.    Yeah I meant to say r/all, not my Reddit front page.   No problem haha. Your post actually reminded me of the feature and inspired me to set it up for myself just now. Also blocked /r/atheism from the front page. RES is amazing.   Why is it that so many new Reddit apps lack the ability to edit comments and self posts? Being an app for a mobile device, on which typos are frequent and easy to make, you'd think that this would be one of the first features implemented, right after comment posting. This is literally the only thing keeping me from switching from Reddit News to something like Reddit Sync or even this.   The reason these posts make it to the top is because they're being upvoted by people. There are obviously people that frequent this subreddit who want, for whatever unfathomable reason, to have this subreddit spammed with "OMG APPLE SUX!!11". You and me and everyone else in this thread are just going to have to accept the fact that we are in what is called a "vocal minority". The best thing you can do is install RES and filter out any and all posts with the word "Apple" in them from /r/android.   lightweight/no-frills  This is kinda what the OP asked for.   Solid Explorer has this. Just press   hold on a file and then choose properties, "Calculate MD5" is an option there.   That's not the expanded jellybean notifications. They've been doing that since ICS.   I politely disagree.  Maybe you're seeing different kind of therapists to me, but I think they provide a wonderful service. Let me tell you why.  Going to a therapist is shit. Even if its helped you at some point, everyone has to admit its awkward, feels pointless and embarrassing. You feel like you're wasting everyone's time and money. Even now, with the knowledge that therapy has helped me make HUGE headway in my recovery, I still dread going to see him.   But the thing is, every now and then, there's that one session. You walk in, and you just gush and gush and gush. And even if they say something you think is stupid, or you disagree with, the fact that you've got someone there to bounce ideas and solutions for problems you may be experiencing off, is the best feeling. Even if you go to 100 sessions and only 1 of them is like that, it is 100% worth it.    This is amazing. Love the support for RES: awesome attention to detail. Please x-post this to /r/pics or something, so the rest of reddit can enjoy this piece of beauty.  Edit: Found a bug. When attempting to visit a subreddit that doesn't exist, the page that suggests possible related subreddits has a bug where the "view images" link is pushed out for some reason. Screenshot: http://i.imgur.com/9473K.png (Windows 7, Chrome)   Ah, a quick Google search reveals you're correct (which I should have done in the first place!) but also brings up this: http://www.engadget.com/2011/06/01/netcom-shows-off-microsd-card-with-integrated-nfc-goodness-vide/  Regardless, it doesn't make gilles' comment incorrect, so I retract my comment.   I was under the impression that it could become NFC-enabled with the use of a special battery?   androidniceties.tumblr.com   Not sure if this is stock aosp or a cm feature, but there's a setting for it in the SMS app, like this http://www.imgur.com/3ESck.png   Probably the same as the last three times we had this thread:  http://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/yu16o/what_are_your_expectations_of_key_lime_pie/  http://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/wmfav/what_do_you_want_for_key_lime_pie/  http://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/ybqft/randroid_what_features_do_you_want_to_see/   You hear that? That's the sound of a thousand Australian redditors crying because they've been driving past these signs for months without realizing that they're a karma goldmine.   SD card slot will never happen.    * No. You don't need to be rooted to run Gameboid.  * The BIOS is the firmware for the GBA. It can't be included with the app because its illegal to distribute it - you're technically supposed to rip your own from your existing GBA (which is the same for game Roms). Obviously this can be found on the internet.  * Yes, ROMs from any location should be fine. Just put them somewhere on your SD card and then point the emulator there when you go to open them up. You can leave them in the .zip file.   The ability to edit comments is basically the only thing I'm waiting on to switch over from Reddit news.   Reddit Sync  Gameboid (not on the market but there are always apks floating around the internet)  Chrome if you're on 4.0+, Opera Mobile otherwise.   For your first point, AOKP (The ICS version, JB builds don't have it yet) has the ability to have the pattern or pass code appear after the slider, so you can have both.    If you put an AOSP ROM on it (which is what the other replier is suggesting) you WILL lose Touchwiz features like SmartStay and Direct Dial.   If you're going to do that then you have to abolish carrier posts as well. How does the fact that T-Mobile now has unlimited data plans have anything to do with Android as an OS? It doesn't. You can't pick and choose between these things. If the Apple posts go then so do the carrier ones.   That's a basterdized carrier version. The dispute is between the iPhone and the International Galaxy S, which does bear many similarities.   I think it's safe to assume that this was done for the purpose of the photo.   Only things missing now are:  * Comment editing * View subreddit sidebar * The ability to go to the subreddit that a post is from (when viewing from /r/all or the user frontpage)   There was a game for N64 where this would actually work. You could control your floating sidekick thing on the same screen with the other controller. It was undocumented in the game manual and I discovered it accidentally when I bumped the other controller while playing. Coolest discovery ever.   Why wait? http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1803672   I've been having a weird problem recently, I'm not sure exactly when it started occurring (ie whether or not it began with a recent update to Chrome or some significant change in my system). Anyways, basically what happens is that on some sites, for example on Youtube, I get this weird text clipping issue where half of some of the characters appears to be clipped off/missing. Here's a screenshot http://i.imgur.com/GX996.png (notice the clipped letters in the comment, the most obvious one being the "E"). As you can see I'm running Windows 7.

Its that way simply because it was around first.   I was under the impression that Odin was leaked by a rogue Samsung employee? It would explain the total lack of documentation on the program and the fact that any and all download sites for it aren't affiliated with any official Samsung website.   You really should look into rooting and flashing an ics/jb rom.

The trouble is, without personally knowing you, its extremely difficult to give advice/extend a helping hand without it sounding super generic. I can't tell you that your life is worth living, or point out the good things in your world or tell you who to talk to. Possibly a close friend or family member could provide that sort of assistance to you, but certainly not a stranger over the internet.  I can however tell you that you *deserve* to live. You deserve the right to a depression-free, happy life - and from one person to another, I sincerely hope you fucking make it mate, I really do. I'd say I'd understand, because I've been there, I've been on the edge, that teetering point of sanity and insanity - but I can't understand you. Everyone's battle is different. Not harder, not easier - different. Hardship is subjective and I don't think anyone should ever claim to know what anybody is going through.  I know its bullshit and its frustrating, especially if I, or anyone else, tell you that only you can do it, only you can move forward. The only thing other people can do is be there. They can just hang around and support you. They can stop you from moving backwards, but the forwards is all on your own. Hopefully you have people like that in your life, that are willing to be there for you in your time/s of need. I was lucky enough to have a huge support network. But I can proudly say I made the journey to where I am now entirely on my own.  You made it this far. Don't back down. You're worth it.

Just an fyi: you're being downvoted not because you're wrong, but because you're being an asshole.   I think what s/he means is that the two images you linked to ([one](http://i.imgur.com/xL83s.png), [two](http://i.imgur.com/8pqo2.png)) are both technically "Google search" - albeit in an exceptionally condescending way.   "Google Now" is *technically* only the notifications you get in the shade without interacting with the device; eg. I frequently get "traffic to home". Google Now utilizes the new (4.1+) Google search interface (which is what the cards are) to display its information. *Technically* the new "cards" interface is not actually "Google Now" - it is just Google search.    Yes. Data from any and all apps (especially 3rd party ones or from the Play Store) can cause issues between major versions of the OS.   I think the difference between this and update me is that update me requires the use of the dev's own servers, whereas this OTA solution supplies hosting for free.   Wow thats embarrassing haha. Okay now I've processed that and got t'(x), found the x value of the stationary point - how do I verify that this is minimum again? Find the minimum of t by computing t(0), t(x0) and t(8).  Stuck on this too. Are they just random values? And what is t(x0) - I've never encountered that.  Again, apologies for being thick. :( Thanks so much for helping me out.   Is it not required to give b meaning, as b is a percentage of V?   Okay, I apologize if I'm being a little slow here, so just bear with me. I'm trying to take things one at a time so I'll get to the rest of your comment later:  t(x) = ((36+x) 100/b + 8-x) / V  A little confused as to how you got here. Obviously you substituted W = bV/100 back into the equation and simplified it, but how did you get here? When doing that I get something like: (100(x^2 + 36) - xb + 8b)/bV   Okay firstly I'm just going to type out the question word for word:  Alex, an accomplished runner, has just been dropped off at Bandicoot Camp in the bush. The roads back to her home on Dugong Lane run south for 6km to the top of Cassowary Hill and then east 8km to the turn off for Dugong Lane. After limbering up for a run home through the bush, she gets a call on her mobile that she needs to get home quickly and there is no transport available at the camp.  Alex decides to run through the bush directly to the road heading east from Cassowary Hill to Dugong lane on a bearing of 135^o T.  If she runs at V km/h on the road to Dugong lane and b% of V through the bush, evaluate whether this is the best heading to run on?  Investigate Alex's options if she runs along the southerly road to Cassowary Hill between 10% to 20% faster than she can run through bush.  You will be assigned a value of V and b from the tables below. Circle your assigned values.  My assigned values are: **V km/h = 20** and **b = 50, b = 61**  I've gotten as far as drawing up a [diagram](http://i.imgur.com/JqJLg.png) to represent the paths, with the diagonal line being the direction Alex is travelling in (through the bush). I'm having a total mind blank and can't get any further than that. :/ Any help would be appreciated.

I was under the impression that that's what Google Now was. Why would they release something like Google now and then have another voice assistant?   Its only become that simple since ICS. On gingerbread it requires you to be rooted - except for some Samsung phones, which come with a built-in screenshot feature in Touchwiz.    Quick question - do the toggles appear and disappear from pressing the settings button (like on ICS AOKP)?    Should just be able to flash it through Clockworkmod Recovery. If you don't have that, flash a [CF-root kernel.](http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1103399 highlight=cf+root)   I'd you're looking for similar functionality, search for Airdroid in the market.   Been using these builds for a couple of days, everything is pretty much rock solid except for ocassional graphical glitches and lag (mostly in low memory situations with lots of apps open).   The thread OP just syncs repos with teamhacksung and builds it every 24 hours. Official cm10 experimental builds seem to come once every couple of days so this should satisfy other crack flashers like me until they start churning out official nightlies.      The CM10 preview with the stock CM kernel, gets pretty decent battery life for me with no underclocking/tweaks.   Rocking JB on my SGS2 right now. No regrets. :)   This was remedied in JB. :) two finger swipe extension reveals more info on gmail notification.    Interesting, thanks for the tidbit. :D   If its got 150+ upvotes, maybe its because 150+ people thought it was?   What makes you use noLED over BLN?   Yeah, you can get it on the market.   Go away with your logic and let this user belittle the other for a minor error.   Probably won't have it because sense uses a keyboard other than the aosp one.    "I'm still alive." Its honest and not impolite or awkward if someone was just asking it to be nice, but it still leaves it open for the person to further pursue it if they're interested/care about you.    Not trying to be a downer but in the last 24 months alone I've had 3 different people say this same thing... and they all bailed on me when they realized just how fucked up I really was. Fuck people.    Jelly bean.    Your kernel has to support it. Search for a kernel that supports "BLN"   The fact that you posted this shows that you are not.    Why would they make a JB release when they don't even have source?   Not sure about miui but the jellybean transitions have been backported for use with any aosp ics rom. http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1738350   Just an fyi, aokp has an inbuilt setting to turn off data or switch to 2g when your screen is off. :)   Just find the latest stock firmware and flash it with Odin.   Handcent seems to work well and r/android likes it.    JB sources haven't even been released on AOSP, its gonna be a little while before you start seeing builds available for anything other than the gnex.   This is just a port using assets from the SDK and the OTA zip from the Nexus that someone uploaded. It will be majorly improved once the source drops in AOSP.   Proof of concept or "just cause" more than anything else IMO.      Flash back to a stock rom using Odin.   Swappa is US-only.   I think that's why the default browser and chrome are staying separate... chrome is a brand and its trying to stay consistent across all platforms, this means that it can't take on the holo UI.  	110
 It does help me but not when my friends think I'm a shitty person for doing it   I know, I should, it does relieve anxiety when I have it, but I have anxiety since the people I know just think its a bad thing   the method is great - and so easy to use once you get the hang of it!!   Yes, before it would get very bunched up and hard to work with, thanks for this tip!   This helped SO much. Great visual!!!!   Thanks! I'm going to do this!  	6
 Wow that color looks so good on you! My only recommendation is to make sure to either line your lips with pink liner or to use a concealed pen to outline your lips so the lipstick doesn't run, because its really noticeable when bright colored lipstick is getting a bit messy    Super late to ask, but do you find writing with a pencil/pen hard to do?    If you have an instagram check out cosplayer Chloe Dykstra's instagram (@chloedykstra)! She did this AWESOME makeup for Lisa Frank about a month ago, like it was spot on!    https://33.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m4who2nDEO1rskeexo1_500.gif      Hopefully mermaid will be a good substitute for kitties 3   And welcome fellow newbie!   Ooh hello there! :) I think all us girls had the dreaded raccoon phase... I went through the emo phase and thought "YES MORE EYELINER IT SHOULD BE AS BLACK AS MY SOUL" but now I deeply regret that decision    IT is well worth the price! Honestly it covers so well I dont need concealer, but you have to buff well so the foundation doesn't appear cakey.  And about Coldstone, its just the way they're run, but mine doesn't require you to sing unless someone asks :P we're lazy!   I cant believe youre a cosplayer, its do rare to find them!!! I've done Taiga Aisaka from Toradora! Yin from Darker than Black, Harley Quinn, and im working on a Poison Ivy now that I got my awesome green lipstick from Melt Cosmetics 3   I know, but it helps boredom when youre at school   (   )    Well I have some Revlon colorstay that fits my budget, but for Christmas I have asked for an Urban Decay palette. I really really really want Vice3 but I have also heard that Naked2 is way better. I'm open to any palettes, really. I just want something super fun!   Thanks for the welcome! Where did you used to live? I currently live in North Carolina.   I'm an IT Cosmetics ADDICT! seriously! I have oily, sensitive skin that is prone to breakouts and I find that it really helps with coverage and doesn't gunk up my pores.   As for hobbies, I'm pretty boring. I work at Coldstone Creamery and I like to cosplay whenever there's a convention, but other than that High school keeps me busy :(   Hey ya'll! I'm a southern girl who loves nothing but lipstick and a fierce winged liner. I've just started to experiment with eyeshadow as I'm only 17, and I really hope to improve my makeup skills. I always been fascinated with makeup (even though my middle school makeup made me look like a raccoon *cringe*) and I'm so eager to learn more tricks of the trade :)    For Christmas I'm asking for an Urban Decay eyeshadow palette. I've had my eyes on Vice3 for a looooong time, but I'm not sure sure its worth it. So MU addicts.... Whats your favorite and why?   I'd recommend Benefit's mascara They're Real!  Not only is it long lasting, but it also volumizes and lengthens your lashes the more you wear it :)   Me! I live near Raleigh in the Apex area :)         This is amazing!   Good idea, thank you so much for the advice! I have a somewhat similar concealer pencil by IT cosmetics and when I get Blow ill try out your tip   I love love love Blow! I just purchased it, but now I have no clue what to use as a lip liner. Do you have any suggestions?   Is Urban Decays "Vice" palette worth the buy?   Good job on the first haul! And I need to say that your cheeckbones are perfect!   Thank you so much! I usually do red lips and plain eye or winged liner and natural lips. You rock!  	24
 When you say you woke up and had to recall who the people in your house were, was it as extreme as having no memory of them at all or did you just feel strange and out of place, like it only just 'clicked' that each of them were members of your family? If you had memory loss and that still happens these days then you *need* to get it checked out. If its the latter though, I still occasionally feel like I'm half in my body and half out of it and everything seems out of place. You shouldn't worry about that too much.  Life can be pretty tough, believe me I've been through some shit. When you have real overwhelming depression the very concept of changing yourself and making your life better seems like an impossible task- I'm at college too and in darker times I've had days when I could barely make it out of bed and to the fridge to feed myself, as pathetic as that sounds, but the first step to recovering from a slump is to forgive yourself for any bad choices you have made and any time you felt too weak to make a change. You didn't gain any interests as a little kid, you never had a relationship, you feel like you are not in control of your life? That's ok! The past is the past, there's not a person alive who doesn't regret not doing a few things differently.   As well as forgiving your past mistakes you need to be fully aware that there are some things you have control over. The very fact that somewhere deep down you would *like* to change is the biggest hurdle in many ways. Depending on your circumstances and how much motivation you can find you can alter your life more slowly or quickly, just try to do something rather than nothing. The 'no zero days' post on reddit really helped me (look it up!) I found that the biggest flaw with most motivational techniques is that they can pump you up and make you want to change the world but that feeling burns out pretty damn fast. The key is baby steps, make a little change each week and stick to it. This time next year you will have completely reshaped yourself.  So what can you do? Your mood is crap, you don't like the fact you are skinny and you'd like to find yourself a girl? Working out is a pretty decent remedy for all of these things. I'm not saying you should run out of the door now and sign up at your nearest gym. Just commit to doing some exercise. Whatever you are comfortable with- 10 push ups and crunches each morning before you shower, go out for a real short run after you get up. And slowly increase this. Think about your diet too, what you put into your body makes all the difference when it comes to your mood and appearance (again, baby steps, but stick with it). Take a full body picture before you start, take it today even, and then you can always look back on it and see how far you came.  You work six days each week, that leaves the occasional day off. Do *something* with it. Its important that you rest when you can but if you want more of a social life then go for it- call up old friends, join a club, ask people if they'd like to hang out that day. Find something to live for and look forward to that day. Similarly try to structure your daily routine so you have an hour or two each night to chill out, no excuses, you work extremely hard and you deserve that.  Thirdly, take some time to find direction. It doesn't matter what it is. A job you would like to do, a business you would like to start, a home you would like to have. Anything that you could aim for that would make your life a happier one. If you don't want to be a software engineer- fine. There are literally millions of people with degrees unrelated to the field they end up excelling in. The fact that you have a degree in a respected subject will help you, and the skills you learn may well become useful later down the road. Very few people know what they truly want to do in college, don't worry about that.  For anything you absolutely can't change, just keep in mind that everything will eventually pass. You have to struggle through college with no free time? In a couple of years college will be over. All you have to do is wait, your circumstances will change and you'll have a lot of free time to fill with any wild post-college plans you make now!  You have it rough, its understandable that you feel like you have a terrible life but I believe in you. I know you are going to get better, we don't know each other but I am counting on you to do something here. Plus, you may not realize it but you have a few really great weapons in your arsenal. You are nineteen for a start, you have barely begun. You could count the number of years in which you have actually had some major decision-making-control over your life on one hand. There is so much time for you to alter your course, just start now and you can absolutely do pretty much anything you set your mind to. You still have both of your parents- I'm 21 and have no real family around me, I know that you can use them somehow, even just for a shoulder to lean on now and then. You're in college, that puts you ahead of most people educationally. You have work experience that is going to look really good on your resume. It may seem like its all just a drag but take whatever you can from every shitty experience you have.  If there's one thing I've learnt from my years with depression its that no one's life is as good as it looks to the outside world, never compare yourself to others because its very rare that anyone is willing to reveal their dark side. Hey, if you looked me up on facebook you'd probably think I have a pretty awesome life. I'm at an ivy league university, have a few pictures of me hanging out drinking with friends and spent the last summer break travelling around the world with my girlfriend. Months later my depression was triggered badly and I couldn't leave my apartment, was self harming and came close to suicide. During that time I found out that a good buddy of mine was also self harming and extremely stressed from the workload. I recently took a psychology class where we did an anonymous test for depression and eating disorders. In our ivy league class of supposedly successful students over three quarters gave results that indicated moderate to severe depression and around fifteen per cent were classed as having an eating disorder. Don't sweat. I know that you are going to come out of this a great person. If you need anything at all feel free to PM me, I'm not on reddit as often as I'd like but I'll always get back to you.   I have started doing this recently. We just have to keep in mind that there is a difference between getting *drunk* and having a couple of beers after a hard day to help you keep pushing through. Set limits.   You are right, this is not ok at all. If they are being this unhelpful now they are probably not going to be reliable in the future- as a general rule I wouldn't keep a psychiatrist who didn't give me a means to contact them and receive a reply within twenty four hours, communication counts for a lot.   If you only care about getting meds after one or two appointments this person may give you a repeat prescription (in which case it would not be particularly important to have regular meetings with them anyway) but a good psychiatrist should be more than just a guy who gives you access to drugs so I would keep reviewing your options and find out if there is any way you could see someone more accessible.  In any case, contact the office again and stress that it is extremely urgent and you need to be seen as soon as possible. No one should have to wait for months and months to be seen.  	3
 Socrates died for this shit   nitesmoke deleted his account. the admins have /r/wow now   There is no proof he received calls at work. Furthermore, the only thing "doxxed" was his dating profile which NITESMOKE PUT UP HIMSELF.   He acted in a childish, stupid manner, bullied people, and we all know he called people fags on this very sub. Yet here he is as this social justice champion. Funny how he suddenly becomes a White Knight when he's the one being attacked?  He's a compulsive liar, don't listen to anything he says.   He deleted his twitter and reddit account to cover his tracks.   You all get Nitesmoke Wolf mounts and the title, Liberator of Gay Rights   I would be very wary of anything Nitesmoke is telling us. First, he comes out as some social justice champion for LGBT rights. What? That shit is completely unrelated.  Second, he's changed his story multiple times to cover up his own childish behavior. He couldn't play WoW for a couple days and had a suck attack. That's the whole story.   He wants to pass blame for having a completely over-the-top, inappropriate and childish reaction to "Wah, I cannot play WoW."  Instead of owning up to his actions, he jumped on the hot-button issue of today (LGBT rights) and became a SJW in a short paragraph of bullshit.  In the words of a famous Blizzard dev: Fuck that loser.   shit 'ead   You're a massive cunt nitesmoke   ME1/2 are on Steam, 3 is on origin. you can redeem your keys for 1/2 on origin too   We heard the same thing about SimCity.

Didnt you know most reviewers these days have been "re-educated" to forget any number under 7.5?   Game reviews are notoriously shit. Their average is usually a 7.5 (when it should be 5).  6 = any number less than 6 does not exist in the game journalist's mind.  6 = worst pile of shit ever. Above average.  7 = might as we not exist. Good game  8 = good game. Great game.  9 = really fun experience. Awesome game.  10 = amazing storycharactersshitgameplay. Bioshock Infinite.

Fuck some of my guildies who complain about their ilvl being low when they barely put in any effort. I fucking go from 500 to 566 in 2 weeks as a Blood/Unholy DK BECAUSE I LEARNED TO FUCKING TANK. I am fucking sick of carrying my guild for heirlooms (i am the only PvE player in the guild who has 540+ ilvl).   *slow down*   Diablo 3 is doing something similar with seasons.

If not, call your credit card and issue a chargeback. PayPal will withdraw money from his account, or put it into the negative if he already spent the money.

If the 4GB version works with the 2GB version (my current card), I can take one of those instead.  EDIT: ~~Bought one from /u/brictop~~ Scammer  EDIT2: Did some research AFTER I sent brictop money. Turns out he is likely a scammer. Called Visa and Paypal. Both said they'll get me a chargeback if I don't get the card in 2 weeks (standard shipping speed). Just a warning for others out there buying from this guy, use caution. Don't be like me and take people's word at face value. I'm just thankful I will be able to get money back.   Uplay, no buy.    things just break in my hands [every 1-2 years]   cheaper laptops/PCs  There's your problem. I have a $1500 gaming laptop from 2008 that still functions great.   What is the melt value on the Merchantman? Also how much for the hornet upgrade and can I use said upgrade on my Specter (Ghost LTI) package?   What idiot buys a Mac every 1-2 years? They last a good 5+ years. Fuck, the one in my house still works fairly well after 8 with a bit of tuning.   How much for the Super Hornet upgrade?   Mortal Online is a shitty ghost town of a game   Did you even read her comment? They already spent their money on Macs. Besides, with a PC you're paying for Windows, anti-virus, Office, peripherals, hardware/software upgrades every 1-2 years.

FYI to anyone considering purchasing the account - Blizzard is VERY on the ball when it comes to account trading. They WILL track your IP address, password changes, etc. to the account and will give a temporary suspension, without warning, if they suspect the account was traded (which is against the ToS). It has happened to me twice and I would be very cautious when trading any Blizzard account.  I have traded accounts like elite dangerous and eve online in the past, but they do not go to the extraordinary lengths Blizzard goes through to stop account trading. You've been warned.   890 Jump - because I'm an idiot who likes shiny new things.  Horney Ghost LTI - traded elite dangerous for this bad boy.

GOD  HATES  FIGS   I am a Christian and one of the last duties Christ gave was for us to go out into the world, preach the gospel and baptize people in the name of the Son/Father/Holy Ghost.  But the way these street preachers "spread God's Word*" is not the best way to go about doing that imo.  I won't go into it much since this isn't /r/christianity, but basically Christians should follow like Jesus did - he performed miracles, signs and aided people *then* followed up with his message as people inevitably asked questions. Most of the stories or parables in the Gospel are told *after* someone comes up and asks Jesus "Hey, Rabbi, why should I do y or how do I do x?" I never recall Matthew 45:16 "Then the Son of God went out into Los Angeles and held up a sign and preached to all the sinful nerds and they were saved that day."  *Funnily enough, most people think "God's Word" is the Bible. In Islam, God's Word is a physical book (the Quran), while in Christianity, God's Word is Jesus himself. The Bible wasn't even completed and compiled yet when John 1:1 was written...

 I would probably have a panic attack. Cry a lot. Call my sister. No answer, travel to her apartment. Cry some more. Then take her car and drive a whole day to my parents house. Find my family and bury them all at the family plot. Take my dogs and live at my parents cabin teaching myself survival skills hoping I learn enough to survive.   Not a book but Thomas Nagel's The Absurd. It expressed and validated everything I felt my whole life. After reading that I decided that the meaning of life is to give life meaning. Felt 1000x happier.   I'll play Mario Kart 64, Star Fox, Zelda: Ocarina of Time, and Cruisin USA on the Wii every once in awhile.   I recently bought the Season One DVD. I can't decided now whether or not it's a good idea to watch it right now. I may binge watch.   Glee. It hit all the right teen angsty notes. And the rest of the show sucked after that.   Home - Dixie Chicks   The saying "it takes a village to raise a child" applies to my big family. Grandparents, aunts, uncles, cousins are not afraid to discipline each other's kids or call each other out on shitty parenting. Sometimes we'll recruit a relative we think will be most effective to talk to another relative about their actions or behaviour.   They drive to the next town or drink in their homes where the cops can't see them.   I was 12 years old. Hometown has an adult dance after the family dance. This was before the town's alcohol ban so it was a pretty popular dance for the adults. I spent New Years at my grandmas where she was also watching her other grandkids whose parents also went to the adult dance. She didn't have a tv so we played card games all night. At midnight people started shooting blanks from their guns cos thats a thing here for big events.   Sunny Sweeney, Lee Ann Womack, Laura Cantrell, Jamey Johnson, the Secret Sisters. Still patiently waiting for their albums!   Amazons and Gladiators. The Room. In The Name of the King: A Dungeon Siege Tale. All damn horrible.   Get "acoustic earplugs". I got some for $7 after I went to a rock/metal show. Didn't need them at all for country concerts though..   As a girl who didn't know the difference between a tank top and a camisole, i have no damn clue either.   Believe what the tv tells them.   Boulder to Birmingham - Emmylou Harris  Whats Up - 4 Non Blondes   The movie "Giant". James Deen, Elizabeth Taylor, Rock Hudson. I watched it on TCM one boring evening. Now whenever someone mentions they don't like old movies, I tell them to watch that. But it is a very long movie but worth it.   The Glass Castle - Jeanette Walls  The Alchemist - Paulo Coelho    I really like being your friend. I think we could be very good lifetime friends. You make me feel like I'm capable of so much more. I'm also happy you're more comfortable with sharing your thoughts and feelings with me because it makes me feel closer to you. I don't want to lose you. But, if you're hoping for more than a friendship, it isn't gonna happen.   The Sarah Connor Chronicles. I'd never been so pissed off at a cancellation before or after and I'm still upset at my friend for introducing me to the show.   I tried this and my dogs understood but he just didn't care.   I sometimes think it's cultural and maybe a little bit biological. My dad is shy as well as my sister and me. My adopted siblings are not shy and neither is my mom. I was shy because I was incredibly self aware and that made me very self conscious. I had a happy childhood and was never bullied. Kids were always nice to me. I was sheltered a lot too. My dad and my sister learned to cope with their shyness by creating public personas but they're still very much introverts. I didn't create a public persona for myself but I learned to control my shyness after years of practice because I was tired of being shy. I'm still introverted though. It took years of practice, years of awkward moments, stilted conversation, and trial and error to learn to cope with my shyness and make friends for the first time ever. Dealing with my shyness is still an ongoing process.  I do think shyness is related to a fear of rejection. When I'm struggling with my shyness and force myself to be confident, I feel a sense of fear and if I feel I'm "rejected", it fucking hurts. But I think "fuck it," life is too short. I heal that rejection and move on.  I also think it's cultural because my old hometown was a very shy town. The people were just shy towards outsiders unless the outsider goes out of their way to be friendly, then they're accepted into the fold. But the new generation is not like this. They're very outgoing, friendly, and eager to experience new things.  	21
 You sir, are a genius! I think it is pretty balanced if so, because killing a witch is pretty difficult if it poisons you, and they are pretty rare.   http://www.reddit.com/r/ultrahardcore/comments/1kymif/news_about_xss_9/   From this comments time, it is in an hour and 30 minutes.   23:00 UTC    Its not up D:   Teams of -99* :P    Is the message can't resolve host name or Can't Reach server? also the "(MPMG)" part is not part of the IP.   You messed up more than that buddy, the format is MMM DD HH:MM UTC and this is not an impromptu...   Well, that's how they are, yes, they do need to be nerfed, but the host cannot do that, if he decides to disable glowstone than so be it.   Nether is 1.6 isn't it?   Does it say teams or allies? No? Then no.   Hopefully, all went well except that the whitelist should have been cut off at the time you got twenty, and that you should have pregened.   YAY :D   Can you give us the direct IP, the one with the numbers?   Hopefully you can, but "trolling" doesn't give a good impression of you as a host.   Fun for you and whoever kills you, we would have all been killed by that one guy, thats not fun, imo, and once again, I didn't play your game...   Check you chat logs dude, I only ever said the F-Bomb, I never called you a cunt, the pinata thing was out of hand though, they were never a set of stuff that automatically made you win, just boosts...    You can do better, but your assistant host, cannot, he has no better judgement and should have left it as an ffa, not a "kill me and you win" game, because that gear was too op.   It would have been fine if you used better judgement and known that the person that killed you would have won no matter what, your hosting skills can be improved on, but the pinata thing was the worst idea I've ever heard. Almost like Gammex, and that's pretty bad. I didn't get to play anyway, you banned me...   DO NOT EVER PLAY THIS GUYS GAMES... Even for his first game, this is wildly unacceptable, he did not pregen or cut off the whitelist, leading to 30 minutes of trying to kick people to lower the player count. Then, the game was changed to FFA due to issues, (which is fine), however, then the host made himself "a walking pinata" with a sharp V sword and full diamond. I said that this was F-ing Stupid, and to that, he said, that this was a "random game" when infact it was a Reddit To2, not an FFA by some nitwit, even though thats what it ended up being. Do not play in this hosts games, unless you want to waste your time.   Swyrnd and test_subject5099   Hi, my name is nether rush, and I killed 4 people in 30 seconds!   WOO!   If you didn't notice, you can log in now!   This usually isnt how this works out, but sometimes it just doesnt work out :/   Hope you do well :D   Practice your pvp overall, and start with an FFA, learn the basics, maybe some tactics, and listen to what some people say in chat, because while sometimes it is really annoying things that arent relevant, sometimes it is helpful. Keep the mentality too at the start of the game, that you will only have 10 hearts, and thats it.  And remember, baby zombies will eat your face, skellies have aimbot, and that the nether is over-powered.   Yeah, I know, I wanted to play too :/   Cmon man it says the max is 30 players :/ Please tell me you didnt start early :/   You already start? It was never specified when you opened and I'd like to play :(   Well, it says Vanilla in the title, but No mobs and Perma-day are not Vanilla :3   My PC doesn't work with ips of this sort, do you have the number form of the IP?    nether enabled?    Not the only one man, mine was the same way.   Please host adc, Brindle's game is home hosted...    3:15 UTC is 11:15 EDT, the server opens at 11:00 EDT    Nether enabled this time?   GG, that win was a bit cheaty, but we killed so many in the portal. Thank you swyrnd for helping me win!   Man, you have to pregen, otherwise it will take an eternity to start the game.   What about the nether? Is its terrain 1.7.3 generated?   If I don't have potions: 1. Pick 2. Sword 3. Bow 4. Water Bucket 5. F S 6. Lava Bucket 7. Food 8. Blocks 9. Torches or Gapples  If I have potions I just remove blocks, Lava, and F S for pots and such, and my inventory itself is put accordingly to my hotbar, like arrows above bow or tools above the pick.   YES, my favorite gamemode!   Why thank you, even if i did lose, it was a completely fair final fight, but as it seems, Strength 1 vs. 10 dogs (I had the strength) is not good if you have no lava.   Can we get some clarification as to what is going on with this tournament, because it seems like game 2 is not happening without any reason why.   Unfortunately I cannot make this particular match, but all other matches in this tournament I should be able to make :)   I would not recommend playing this host's games, very early in the match he started an event that caused rain to do damage, with no notification on this post that that would happen. When anyone would say anything about this, he would reply "quit yo bitchin" completely disregarding anything said. Do not play a game from this host if you wish to pvp, and not hide in caves from an event we were not notified of.   Should be open, Its 10 minutes before start...   This opens in 45 minutes from when I replied to you...   Yeah, it should be open, but its not...   Why hello there, I'm test_subject5099 (I prefer JT personally), and I've been around since May 2013. I personally love the competition, and play a lot of  FFAs, but team games are always fun (I prefer random teams games over chosen, but that's just me.). Always have fun, and remember, pots are op, and enchantments first!    For future reference: 4:30 UTC is actually 12:30 EDT   Is there a chance you would allow solos?   Better hope that skeleton is on the left or right side of your screen!   When does it open?    We over at /r/ultrahardcore have a very similar idea, where we have the "Golden Head". Simply craft a golden apple but instead of the apple use a player head and heal 4 hearts! This encourages pvp and gives strategy to how much gold you should keep on your person.   Yeah, got second :( what is your IGN anyway?    hopefully I won't die with potions this time!   Don't worry, I died with pots yesterday, so you should definitely be able to kill me :)   I will murder you all 3   ICEEEEEEEEEEEEE, I totally will play this :)     Yes   	61
       What I meant by the proposed question was like:      What if Rick died instead of Shane in the field?  What if Andrea got bitten, instead of Amy?  Carol, instead of T-Dog?      They would still have the bonding over time, just as different people.    Pardon the possibly bad grammar in the title - English is my first language.  Anywho...  Who would be in which role in the "new" group?  Where would they be?  Would they be a better group of hardened survivors than the group we have now?   Not knowing what kind of man he is, that could be a good choice...but looks can be deceiving, can't they?   Very well thought out and a good choice. Bravo.   Why? Because that's the question that I asked, mother dick. :)   Too soon, man.  It's a good thing my job doesn't have a revolving door entrance. I'd have a nervous breakdown as soon as I got in the middle.   Maybe freckledfuck can see a lot about a person just by looking at them. A hell of a lot, apparently...

I can understand delays for snow and ice (I'm from SC), but today my daughter has a 2 hour delay...with dry roads, no snow, no sleet, and no ice anywhere.   So why the delay?!  Are schools training our children to be a bunch of testicles that can't take the cold?  I'm just waiting for the day when she has a delay because the sun is too hot.  Maybe I feel like they're cutting her education short (over multiple "non-necessary" weather delays)...maybe I'm just bitter.  I don't have a delay for my job.  Meh.      Maybe she was looking at John Legend when Common was looking at her.

IMO, it depends on the degree of the accident.    Leaving vehicles involved in a traffic accident in the middle of the road (that could easily be moved to the side of the road) can cause traffic congestion and possibly another wreck down the line.      If it's at all possible (car is capable of being moved, no one involved in the wreck is seriously injured, etc.)...it's a wise move to clear the road.       http://marvel.wikia.com/Avengers_Vol_5_2   Leslie Nielson was a serious actor before his role in Airplane!.

I had just moved in, living with a friend of mine and his family. Me and my friend both shared a room, with me on top bunk and him on the bottom,  and I made a point to screw with him every now and then. My friend was out for the night, not going to return until late, and I knew that he was out smoking and would come back home still super high, as he had done the last couple nights before.   I took some of his clothes, put them in his bed, and filled them with rolled up towels, ie pajama pants with rolled up towel legs with a bit of towel sticking out the bottoms - just enough to place socks on the end. I used a backpack to imitate the size of a torso, towels as arms, and a snowboarding helmet as a head.  http://imgur.com/rs7FaPM  I then covered the fake person in his bed with the blanket, leaving the feet sticking out, making it look like a person was passed out in his bed face down.  http://imgur.com/oO0w7Xo ,   http://imgur.com/EAXeEWG  Fast forwarding, I'm up on the top bunk and I hear his car pull in. He heads up to his room, turns the lights on, and just stares in disbelief at his bed for several minutes straight. He doesn't move, just stares, trying to comprehend what the hell is going on, why there are no extra cars in the driveway, so who is passed out on the bottom bunk? Eventually he just couldn't handle it. He turns the lights off and walks out. I then hear a car door close, engine start, garage door open, followed by him just noping the fuck out and leaving to go sleep somewhere else.

Not so much insight, just lots of experience with it working on the fogger. The screws naturally rise out a bit by themselves in the fogger, and screwing them down tight keeps the resistance low, however if I want an ohm or two higher, I'll keep one of the screws slightly less tight.    There are two resources I can't recommend enough.   +1 800-273-8255 /r/SuicideWatch   People call all the time. I've called twice and it's a great resource to have.   I've also had this same struggle of a wonky sleep schedule due to depression, and the inability to gather thoughts due to anxiety. I always feel like I'm sad as hell, but don't know exactly what or how to talk about it. Going to sessions again and again makes it easier and easier to collect thoughts - it's hard and I feel like it's almost something that takes practice.   Best of luck, friend.      She's pretty! Looks good!    Veritas, for sure.    I'd say to feel free to make your own thread asking this question. This shouldn't be limited to a reddit breaking "daily questions" thread.   Just about everyone starts smoking underage, they just stay quiet about it. Vape at whatever age you want to if it is the only way you can quit smoking.    I've got the opposite advice of tropical walrus. If your atomizer has fallen below 1 ohm, you might be able to unscrew the screws just a tiny bit to increase the resistance. Else, my friend with an istick just unscrews the atomizer from the istick just a tiny bit and it increases the resistance - this is with a nautilus, however.   Also, your MVP will fire anything greater than 0.7 ohms. The istick fires anything equal to or greater than 1 ohm.    This.   Or the insulator around the 510 pin is twisted and not preventing the positive current from running into the negative current, causing a short.   [here's the piece were talking about.] (http://imgur.com/SWjxuq2) The pin that contacts the bottom of the atomizer, and the white ring insulator around it. Mine is very dried out and crapping out as well.    You'll most likely have to buy a new one (or figure out how to replace it). I thing the general idea around this subreddit is that batteries usually last a year or more until they start to decline.   Most of the time, I think, the vendors who give the product prototype to the reviewer usually make a lot of the changes in the prototype that the reviewer recommends, so the final product has a good chance of not having a cheap rattling button.   WHY does the .gif just stop? Who thinks that it is acceptable for me to see only the beginning of a slow motion balloon pop?    I found it in the video in the article op linked to. The clip in the .gif was before the video this guy linked to. Idk why he posted this version of the video here.    I think I missed the part of that video where the .gif comes from.    I would learn to overcome my fear of water brought on by the drowning of my father by sneaking into a large sailboat and sailing into the open ocean, where I'm met with a horrible sadistic storm that is ever increasing in intensity. As a response I tie myself to the ship and scream at the sky, accepting my death, until the storm eventually passes, I dry off, and suddenly crash my boat into the edge of the world as I know it. The head of my boat cracks through a wall painted to look like a skyline, and I immediately notice a set of painted stairs leading up the painted wall. As the set of stairs leads me to a door which reads "exit", I meet my real father who lives in the moon, and offers me a life encompassing ultimatum: Either I stay with him and continue to live in a world where everyone is watching me, or I venture into the open world. In response to his ultimatum, I open the door reading "exit", after saying  "Good morning, and in case I don't see ya, good afternoon, good evening, and good night!"   Seems to me like a very great way to capture personal information. You have one large outdoor WiFi network with very heavy traffic and no access restrictions. All it takes is some sniffing of that traffic to learn an awful lot about the people connected.    Could be trippin hard.    [4]    You could plastidip it    He's a moron for saying anyways.

This is one of the very few reposts that I don't mind. It's a classic. Cracked up.    [Picture goes back as far as 2012.](http://imgur.com/vHYqau1)   And seeing the steam rise out of your boots.    The fuck   Not doing anything tonight :). I'm already in bed and could care less about the change of a number. I support you, friend!    Rest in Peace.    It's the first of a three tier gift   Secret Santa is telling you to get ready for that Ruffneck Bass   Agreed with this^  What is your power source? The easiest way to do it is to supply higher amperage-use a more powerful battery.    Grate that fucker.    The first step is to not be on reddit.    Nsfl   so he stole thousands of dollars from his friend's wallet and fled on foot, then by stolen car, then on foot again once the friend alerted the police.  So he wasn't actually being chased by the police. He was just a wanted man who had committed a crime and went to pet kitties before he knew cops were after him.    Same, man. I got most of the lingo but got lost near the end.    The Matrix.    Ahh, that's a bit different than my country. Sorry that you have to deal with that.    Wow that looks ridiculous.    loves to drift illegally   As in,  like... Sideways with a car? Cause drifting here is pretty cool.    Only part time.    Tor wouldn't load for me months before this. It's gotten very slow.    What the fuck did you just fucking say about me, you little bitch? Ill have you know I graduated top of my class in the Navy Seals, and Ive been involved in numerous secret raids on Al-Quaeda, and I have over 300 confirmed kills. I am trained in gorilla warfare and Im the top sniper in the entire US armed forces. You are nothing to me but just another target. I will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of spies across the USA and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. Youre fucking dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and thats just with my bare hands. Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the United States Marine Corps and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little clever comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldnt, you didnt, and now youre paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it. Youre fucking dead, kiddo.   That smirk at the end says,  "I'm about to fuck up your whole day."    If we were to go fuck up North Korea and export some freedom to their front door, I think I'd join the war effort.

I don't know if it was a matter of the services being back online or what I did, but I'll share how I got into the account just in case it's a solution.  Started up CoD Advanced Warfare signed into a different account on the Xbox. Notification said Press whatever button (Select on the 360) to switch profiles. Did so. Put in password. Viola.    Wtf. [Is China raping us right now?](http://imgur.com/Mwj0N7w)   Question.  I'm trying to play single player via Xbox One, however my account requires a password in order to sign in. On the 360 you could just unplug the ethernet cable to sign in without a password. Is there an equivalent on the Xbox One?   You too!    I didn't. It was only an issue with one bottle and I didn't see fit to complain about it. Thank you, though!    I really loved this community when I first joined around 10 months ago.   30+mg? That sounds like flavor hell - nicotine really dulls down flavor.  Have you considered that having a higher power device allows you to drop nicotine levels because you're producing more vapor in each hit?   Great company with nice customer service in my opinion.  My last order was from them on 10/2/14. I ordered GWAR Bloodbath and a refill on Hawk Sauce. The Hawk Sauce I got was pretty different than usual   bad - it tasted like 50%Hawk Sauce and 50%Thug Juice. The Bloodbath was absolutely incredible, though.   Anything single coil. The mvp won't power dual coils well.    Laugh.    Yeah fucking right. A small country full of giant babies. Take them out.    The   Sounds like me  Except the events were all true, and I'm a man. I had like the worst luck in the world getting to work, cars constantly breaking down no matter which one I drove,  my favorite dog passing away, landed in the hospital for breakdowns, storming out because I hated my job, etc.   Girl most likely had a severe anxiety disorder    Thank you so very much!! Your words are very motivating and helpful! Thank you so much for commenting. I will remember that I can stop and relax every once in a while  :)   Also, congratulations on your trip!    There's a fine line between the amount of long distance driving that calms my nerves, and the amount that has me horribly on edge.   Driving long distance is horribly anxiety provoking for me, and I've been dreading this trip for the past month or so now.   I have this irrational fear of my own fear, that I'll panic, lose contact with reality, lock up in traffic and crash, and crashing somewhere completely unknown frightens me.   These last couple of months I've actually experienced what I'm telling myself is a new symptom of anxiety - having trouble breathing. I've experienced a whole bucket of symptoms, but never this common one. These last few days (it's horrible right now), I've been having to yawn or try to inhale as deeply as possible to scoop a deep breath out of myself, because I feel as if there is something in my upper chest/bronchi preventing me from taking a deep breath. This adds to my fear, because I of course have that part of my brain which is convinced it's always cancer, and I'm worried about suddenly not being able to breath halfway through my trip.   I also have the worst of luck with cars, and I'm also naturally scared of breaking down somewhere and spending Christmas somewhere halfway between my starting point and destination.   Thank you for reading -  any words of encouragement are greatly appreciated! I've struggled for some years and seen treatment both from a hospital environment and one on one therapy, however reminders and support will be much appreciated.

Sadly, I'm probably the 1% of reddit that doesn't care about that movie right now.

I was not aware that this was the case. I'll be fighting the regulation as always.    It's whatever, I guess.

    I'm very, very glad you made it out safe and sound :D      I always feel a bit weird telling people about how bears are my favorite animals. Shortly after, I have to explain to them that it's in no way a sexual reason. Yeah... Grizzly Bears are my favorite. I even like the bad, too, haha!   I think he was just being thourough and tying up loose ends. All for the sake of being loyal to Frank, maybe? I'm not sure. But yeah, I felt like he didn't need to kill her. But it happened :/   Yup, you're right about that on both parts! From what I know of Superman, he seems to be overpowered, a bit. But Doomsday did manage to kill him! He was then brought back to life, I don't know how, though.  EDIT I also heard, this is pretty recent, that Supes is getting new powers. I personally feel like he doesn't need any more, but it will be interesting to see how that turns out.   	6

I have been thinking about going away the entire family but then it just feels like I'm trying to run away from my problems. Is there a difference to being sad at home or being sad at a beach?   	5
 Oh man, The Thing would could REALLY go either way. The organic effects would be so interesting though. Things twisting and turning and melting and growing... Might try this. Although it might be especially disturbing. I tried playing Octodad while tripping once and now tentacles freak me out so who knows.   I love horror and dark things in general. I've always been afraid to put on a dark movie I enjoy or a horror game in case I go into a bad trip or something because of it. What about you guys?      Whether it be a microscope or a telescope, you will never see the end.   You're right. That's why this is still confusing for me. Dammit, we really need to make that timeline/flowchart already...   But wait a minute, isn't HM 2 set in '89-90's?   So, in the first game [Beard mentions to Jacket that none of this is really happening](/spoiler).  So, are we in a dream? Are we in Hell? Is Richard the Devil? Either way, it seems like their world may not be set in reality. Thoughts?   Fuck your artificial barriers and fuck your shipment of goods as well.   Despite the somewhat vague post, I feel like I completely understand where this is coming from. One time I tripped I thought of circles and how everything seems to be a circle or sphere.  Everything is infinite.   That's good to hear, I was beginning to think I was the only one with this mindset!   I just feel like some people, like me, can lose themselves too much in the trip. For instance; At one point I almost convinced myself that I should live my life alone because that's all I know how to do. Which isn't healthy in reality. Putting good judgement into things is never a bad idea in my opinion.   Completely agree with this. Nothing is written in stone, so to speak. As much as our world wants to believe it is. It's scary and wonderful at the same time.   Yeah, I've definitely had my fair share of revelations. But take everything you experience from your trip with a grain of salt, if you will. Think back when you're sober just to be sure you were thinking clearly. There's been many people, myself included, that have had false revelations. It can go either way but just use your best judgment!   Dude, I've been wanting to trip out and play this! haha   http://www.fathomevents.com/event/beyond-the-world-of-interstellar  Never say never (;   Encouraging what? If I say "I took two hits" in an LSD forum it doesn't take a genius to connect the dots. I can say Grateful Dead all I want and there's no rule here that says I can't. That's all I have left to say to you.   Get off your high horse, I didn't come to LSD for bad vibes...   So when Interstellar was still playing in theaters I decided to go see it with my sister and that we would both take two hits of some Grateful Dead. So I wanted to time it perfectly so we'd be tripping by the time the movie started. I gave us a 45 min window and I toked a bit on the car ride to help the peak.  We go in the theater and, surprise, there's these two empty seats right in the Goldie Locks zone of the theater! These seats... where fucking leather armchairs that reclined and all! I saw these seats and I was pissing myself with excitement. We get chilled and then the trailers start. It's hard remembering any of them but they were pretty intense for the most part. Then, the feature presentation begins. Fucking Interstellar.  This fucking movie was just the perfect setting for a trip. Great story, great acting, emotional, great cinematography, and it's about fucking space! The scene where it's just static shots of Saturn and the calm thunderstorm sounds are playing (When the one character puts on the Sounds of Nature CD to calm down) was just perfect. Absolutely beautiful.  Here's something I really loved about it; When a certain topic came up in conversation in the movie (Love, time travel, God, etc.) it was like a roundtable discussion. They didn't let anything fly over your head, they almost explained it directly to the audience with pictures and metaphors and everything. Great learning experience. When they were arguing about love it was just like, DAMN. Also, the first time they go through the black hole and look at the videos from back home over the last however many years... I almost cried with them aha Powerful stuff.  Then, the climax of the movie hits. Everything has been getting more intense and darker by this point. It's one of those mindfuck movies and I HEAVILY enjoy those. When I'm tripping you can imagine how cool that is. So then the story really begins to wrap itself up in a pretty intense way. Arguing, events happening on Earth and in space, it was a lot all at once. My sister started freaking out. She walked out of the theater and of course I walked out with her. Missed the ending of the movie and I will regret it to this day because she decided to just have a cigarette and call our ride...  I don't know the science of it but... Did she really freak out over having a nicotine craving?? Just a thought, I'm not a smoker but it seems logical I guess. Still a great experience that I wouldn't trade for the world and I encourage everyone to trip the fuck out and watch this on surround sound!  	18

    and some with good modding community if no magic system?  Good as in interesting magic systems.         It says on the official page one of the reviews say that it's similar to Nobilis, that's why i said that.    Mythender  People say it's like Nobilis do you know more about the system?  As in how do powers work and such?  Also game's free, awsome.   Although in french it looks like a good and original system what i don't seem to like is the limited number or powers and such, but i may try to house rule some more in there.  I like the weapons having free will, i can already imagine a paladin with a murderous rapist sword, you know, classy stuff, like in the example of the guy saving two girls and the sword wanting a "peculiar reward" against the wielder's will.   How powerful can a rifts character become?   How powerful can a character be?   I love those kinds of systems, i know about Nobilis, Chuubo, Don't rest your head, Mage the awakening, amber dice less one thing i disliked about amber is it's short array of powers, i like having alot of room to choose.  Also giving little more info on how powerful can a character be would be great.  	10
    It's just so disheartening that they don't understand what donation is and what it's like to not be able to have a kid with the person you love. Forget their lack of respect for their SO's bodily autonomy.      About me: I'm 20F and married to a woman. I identify as nonbinary but my mom said I can "get a sex change ten years after" she's dead. My wife is also 20. We've been together nearly five years.  A bit of back story; I had this job working with a guy with Down syndrome. I loved it. I love him. The agency doesn't pay regularly and every two weeks, when my pay was due, I was crying because they somehow fucked me over. This caused me to lose my apartment. I have since quit the job. During my last week, the last week of January, the master cylinder in my car went so I have no brakes. I used my dad's truck for work, and emailed my professors that I couldn't be on campus. I have not gone to class in two weeks and am at risk for being dropped from 18 credits and losing my financial aid.  Last night, he comes home from work and starts yelling at me that the truck is damaged and I drove it last. We live in a college town and have several houses on our street that have college kids. One had a party Friday night. Apparently someone drunk ripped off his mirror. I said I had nothing to do with it, which I didn't, and he starts yelling that I wasted a ton of gas and abused my use of the truck. When I told him that I hadn't used it except to go a mile each night but that on Friday I had a ton to do to get my car fixed, and that I was at risk for failing out of school, he yelled at me that it wasn't his fault and that if I didn't run my car into the ground this wouldn't have happened.   I told him the master cylinder went on a 10 year old car and there was nothing I could have done. I went  upstairs to grab my stuff to leave and he yelled "don't forget to slam your door" in the douchiest tone possible.   As I went down the stairs, I said "I'm depressed and can't afford counseling and nobody in this house cares!" And then I left. I called my best friend crying and he came to hang out with me in a local Rite Aid. We tried to drive my car but the brakes are completely gone so my dad told me to take his truck, no reference to previous conversation. My mom hasn't mentioned it either.   She had known that I was seeing a counselor at my college for about three months and knew it ended with the last semester. She hasn't mentioned except, when I told her I was going, to say that I was "stronger than that". She has known for five years that I have panic attacks but says that's I'm over dramatic.   How it's a good thing: I have been not going to the hospital for help because I didn't want to disapoint anyone. They don't care. I'm free to go.   TL;DR: life sucks, then what?      I am knitting this for my friend and my idea is that when her little girl outgrows it, it can be her first pillowcase. Is this safe?                     If I have a disagreement with my parents about anything, my wife takes their side. She claims she hates confrontation and is trying to avoid a fight but she just makes me livid.   Today, for instance, my sick and physically disabled mother was struggling to breathe. When asked if she needed to go to the hospital, she made up an excuse about insurance and not wanting to go. My wife said wait until Monday and then if she isn't better she will go. I have class all day on Monday. My mom said wait until Tuesday. My wife agreed with her.   Tl;dr: MY MOTHER CAN'T BREATHE AND MY WIFE AGREED TO PUT OFF A HOSPITAL VISIT.      I have a 1997 850 and the other day the brake light came on. The manual said it needed fluid, and, when I went to go buy fluid, I had no breaks. My brother put some of his in it and we pumped the breaks and it kept seeming to drain but it isn't spraying or leaking anywhere we can see. Anyone know what's wrong and if it's an easy fix?   I think I want T in the future, but I know I want to give birth and breastfeed. If I go on T before that, how likely am I to become infertile? Will I be able to breastfeed? I want to do gel if that matters because I want as much control as possible over results.   I have some really severe suicidal ideation, including a preferred method if I were to do so. However, I don't intend to. My understanding is that ER staff do not discriminate between suicidal ideation and suicidal intent. Is this accurate? Do I need to distinguish which I am experiencing?  My mom is physically disabled and rather sick. Since I am self admitting, can I leave if there is an emergency with my family? If so do I need to make this concern clear ahead of time?  I know that, at my hospital, if you have a baby or are sick, your spouse can stay with you overnight once in a while. Is this possible for this situation?  How much say over visitors do I get? My mom can't go and my dad won't so I would really rather be able to just say I don't want them there, but I do want my wife to be able to see me. Is this possible?   Since I am planning ahead, am I not sick enough or is it not an emergency enough that I should go?  What I need is medication. If possible, I'd like to get a prescription and get out of there. I don't have health insurance or free clinics near me and I'm broke. I'd rather not get even more behind in school if I can avoid it. Can that happen?  Does my college have to be accommodating to this? I'm a first semester sophomore at a community college and I'm taking 18 credits, 3 of them writing intensive. Do they have to be lenient with me or can they fail me over it? Last semester I saw a counselor at my school and we were supposed to work on finding me real help but my insurance fell through. She diagnosed me with depression and anxiety but it's not on paper anywhere. She seemed scared and insistant that I get help ASAP but I really couldn't. Is that relevant or helpful to me?  When I get nervous, I smile, laugh, and joke. In high school when I tried to get help at the safe room, they didn't belive me because of it. I really can't control it. Will the hospital do the same thing?  Is there anything I'm not thinking of that may be important?  Edit: I'm 20 but married. Will I be with kids or adults or adolescents? I live in Pennsylvania for reference.      I've poked around and even posted here a bit before, but here goes, I suppose.  I'm Trish/Patric. I'm genderqueer transmasculine. I'm not picky about pronouns at all. Use whatever you like.  My wife and my best friend, who is a transguy, are the only people I'm out to really at the moment. I don't intend to be out to my immediate family. Top surgery is a definite and T is a maybe, bottom surgery is a no go for me. Feel free to ask me whatever you'd like to know.   I have diagnosed clinical depression and anxiety and have for almost a decade. For me, that means insomnia and not caring about myself at all. Typically, an adult can bounce back and at least bother to do the bare minimum. I was 11 or 12, though, and not caring developed into terrible habits, that, at 20, I'm still struggling to kick.   When I joined reddit a bit over a year ago, and came across SCA, I subscribed because I've always been lucky to have great skin, so I figured I might enjoy learning to actually wash my face. It took another nine months or so before I actually used it, but hey, I did eventually.   Since then, I've started to remember to brush my teeth regularly. I know, gross, but being young and depressed is making bad choices. I've also started to drink water almost exclusively. I'm chubby, by like a lot, and have always been the kind of kid to cut gym class and hang out somewhere else, even if somewhere else is a bathroom. I've started using my college fitness center by choice.   SCA has really helped me make some positive changes in my life, and I thank all of you for that.   My college has a free fitness center available to students. I'm finally taking advantage of it. I'm heavy. Depression will do that to you, as I'm sure a lot of you know. I don't care about losing weight right now. I'm just happy to be able to take the steps without getting winded. Today was day three of roughly 20 minute workouts and already I feel better physically. It doesn't seem to help my depression like people claim it will, but physically its not bad and I even find myself enjoying after years of cutting gym in high school. It's something at least.      Married: 1 month, 10 days.  Number of times we've had sex: 17.  Highlights: 10 were in the first week of being married.   On our wedding night, you fell asleep with my nipple in your mouth, throwing me into a panic attack. I still count that time.   You've gone down on me once, and you weren't happy about it.   I love you but dammit baby you're supposed to want to have sex with your new wife. If we did the penny jar first year thing, we couldn't buy a McChicken at the end of the year.   Edit: thank you guys for being so supportive. I was in a bad spot last night when I posted this. I have diagnosed depression and anxiety and one of my symptoms when I get seriously upset is that I can't sleep, which manifested into this. My wife and I (yes, we're lesbians for those of you who expressed confusion) communicate endlessly. She has a lower sex drive than me and I need to get over it. Last night I was upset because, I after I went down on her and then got her off a second time, she had no interest in either going down on me or otherwise doing what I like. We have discussed it multiple times and I need to learn to accept it. Prior to getting married we averaged 3 to 4 times every week. Our wedding week ramped it up and I'm just hating the slow down. She has PCOS so hormone stuff is totally wacky meaning her libido is, too, but it sucks to be 20 and have her have a low sex drive.   I have what my best friend, who's a transguy, and I call "trans memories" which are memories from childhood that, if it happened now, you would know that you were trans*. For me, these include being seven and trying to use a toilet paper roll as an STP; being 10 and seeing the "Transitions" episode of Law and Order: SVU and crying because I thought my parents must have had me surgically made into a girl when I was born. Also during my childhood, I had plenty of experience being reminded that my mom knew when she found out she was pregnant with me that I would be a healthy girl because God didn't give her 16 years of not being able to get pregnant to give her another boy (I have two older adopted brothers and my parents fostered over 40 boys in the mid 80s). Whenever I wear my binder, which I have been a lot lately thanks to you guys giving me advice on it, she makes comments about how I look deformed and says that I must be binding in the most disgusted voice. I'm out to her as a butch lesbian, but when I came out she told me I had to wait until 10 years after she was dead if I was going to become a guy. She accepts other transpeople she just doesn't want it for me. It's hard. I'm just starting to feel better in my skin and she makes fun of me... I can't be out to her. It would kill her. She's physically disabled with a whole list of medical problems. It just sucks.   I work 17.5 hours every week, I have 18 credit hours this semester, I take care of my disabled mom and I need to do well this semester to graduate on time. I transport my wife to and from her job, too. My dad expects me to do everything. Today he told me brother (who does nothing. I repeat, nothing at all. He plays video games and sponges off of my family and his girlfriend. He's almost 19.) To tell me I had to get the balance of his debit card. They are both more than capable and I already do so much else and I didn't want to so I refused. He started harassing me about how I eat off the money so I can do it. He gets my food almost never.   My wife and I both work. If we don't have enough after bills, my mom will get us food. I left. I wanted a cigarette so fucking bad but I'm trying not to smoke this year. Also, I don't have any money to buy a pack with. I want to die so bad. It's always little bullshit like this, but it adds up. It sounds so fucking stupid that this makes me feel this way.   I'm quitting my job in 2 weeks because they often don't bother to pay me and I have to wait forever for my money. That's why my wife and I live with my parents. I feel like a goddamn failure. I'm 20, married, doing well enough for me in school (I have a 3.08) and I love my job but they don't pay me so I have to live at home. It fucking sucks. I know I won't kill myself. I have too much responsibility to kill myself. One day it will get better. But right now it fucking sucks.    My school councilor diagnosed me with depression and anxiety but she can't really do anything to help. I don't have money for a doctor or insurance so I'm just fucking stuck. I can't check out of life for a week to get help because of all the fucking responsibility. I'm sorry for the wall of text. I just sort of needed to vent and all.  Edit: You guys are so great. I don't have a response right now for each of you, but know that you help me greatly. I ended up hanging out with a friend tonight and walking around the mall locally. I don't know if I'll go to the hospital any time soon, honestly. My wife won't have a way to get to and from school without me. That's not fair to her. Honestly, I'm scared. We haven't slept apart for more than one night since I was like 16. I don't want to be without her for that long.    I have a full torso binder, but it rolls too much so I'm trying to fold it up and over like some dudes suggested the other day. It's great for my chest, but I feel like I look pregnantish. Did anyone else feel this way at first? When did that feeling go away? I am trying to lose weight, but I'm pre or non T (not sure yet) so my body fat is very female distrusted.            Where did you find binding/packing materials and the like? How did you get information about therapists and HRT? It's tough enough now with the Internet to help, but I can't figure out how it was done before then.   I have and Underworks 997 binder and a very large chest. While it does a pretty good job of flattening me, it will roll up on occasion, and it's very difficult to get it back down without my wife's help. Has anyone else had this problem? How can I keep this from happening?                My job requires paperwork to be done at home, on my time. It takes three times as long to do it by hand as by computer, so I computerized all of it and have no access to the means to do it by hand. I have the forms that must be filled already partially and incorrectly filled in Excel, but no access to fix it. My job has already withheld my pay for 3 weeks and it will likely be 3 more or even longer before I see my money. I cannot afford to pay for the one month subscription. If anyone is willing to let me use their login just temporarily, I would really appreciate it.                        I don't care about the discrimination I face. I don't care that teachers bullied me in high school. I care that my mom and so many other people say that if I had the choice I'd have chosen to be straight. I wouldn't. I love everything about being gay. I love gay culture, I love having a cause, I love my wife, I love going to pride. I love being gay. Why is that such a bad thing? That really gets me down...   The character, who's name escapes me, dies in Phoenix with his boyfriend and I think his mother. The hospital disposes of his body wrapped in a garbage bag with other garbage. His boyfriend pays a funeral establishment to have him cremated despite the hospital's refusal to issue a death certificate. I have tried to Google this, but I can't come up with anything definitively confirming or denying it.   My job doesn't pay me when or what or how they're supposed to and it's really contributed to my mounting depression and anxiety.   In high school, I started the Gay Straight Alliance for my school. Today I found out that my successor's successor, whom I selected for the role, got into her dream school with a full merit scholarship strongly because of her role as President of the GSA. She Facebook messaged me and thanked me for giving her the opportunity to reach this goal.   It helped me to realize that I have a positive impact on people's lives and gave me the boost I needed to send this email. I don't even know if the place is hiring, but I tried, and for that I'm proud of myself.   Today was a good day, Reddit.   I'm pretty upset for good reason and sitting in a McDonald's typing this, so sorry if it's all jumbled and fucked up.  We recently moved back in with my parents because my job doesn't like to pay me correctly and we couldn't keep up with our rent. My 18 year old brother is prince of the mother fucking earth. He does whatever the fuck he wants, including, tonight, when he came in the bathroom while I was showering and turned on the sink water and started flipping out and calling me names because I let his stupid ass dog in his room so it wouldn't shit on my goddamn flood. Big surprise, the fucking puppy shit on the floor. He should have taken the fucking dog out or put it in it's crate if he wasn't going to be able to take it out. I told him to turn the water off because the family dog had just puked all over me and I was trying to get cleaned off. He wouldn't. I told him to get the fuck out of the bathroom. He said "Or what, you'll sit on me?"   I ran to my room and got dressed. I went downstairs and told my parents that SOMETHING needs to be done about their goddamn hellion. My dad said "I hate to say it, but I think it's time you find a place to live." My wife and I left and came to this McDonald's. I don't know what the fuck to do from here. We have no money, about 200$ in food stamps and a quarter of a tank of gas. I have to work tomorrow and I know they won't fucking pay me anyway. We just finished the last day of our semester of college, so switching to dorming isn't possible right now. I don't know what to do.   If you're just commenting to tell me I'm awful, please, save it.    ---    **tl;dr**: My brother's the best and I think I'm homeless.         Faux Thanksgiving was the Tuesday after the normal holiday; all of the talk was about her 18 year old, single, uneducated, unemployed, knocked up sister. That's fine. It was all super positive and everyone (except those of us with brains) is excited for her. My wife's aunt and uncle were there. They didn't say hello to me and only spoke to me to show me a picture of their dog. They also walked past me to say goodbye to others and didn't acknowledge me again. Then, we found out, her mother and said knocked up sister started shit talking us as soon as we left.   Her mother originally did not intend to come to our wedding. After she was called out on it, she decided she would show up. Knocked up sister had an appointment and didn't show up. Mother made fun of our venue, made fun of my wife's outfit and feet, and complained that it was too small of a wedding. She left as soon as possible, no congratulations were offered and she texted later asking for her Crock Pot back since she forgot it. She owes my wife 15 dollars for a Mary Kay item and we haven't seen the money despite asking several times and really needing the money, and I felt it was ballsy to ask for it back when she owes us.  Last night was the family Christmas party. The only people who said hello to me were my MIL's ex roomate who felt awkward that everyone was ignoring me and my wife's other aunt. The pregnant sister tried to push me down some stairs and everyone else pretty much just ignored me. My wife was said hello to, I was just ignored.  My wife also has 3 younger sisters; they're 15, 15, and 13. I went all out on gifts for them. They're great kids and we get along great. I do not feel at all motivated or obligated to get gifts for the mother or other sister for Christmas. I need my money more. I am sick of going to things like this to be treated like shit. I hate it.   ---    **tl;dr**: Wife's family is a bunch of twatwaffles and I'm sick of it.               :D      I'm a lesbian and a United Methodist. If this sub isn't really a gay friendly one, can anyone direct me to one that is? I'm working on trying to get over my depression, and seeing homophobic posts won't help.      I hope this is okay here; just subscribed today and this is my first post here. Sorry if it's not okay.   I unsubscribed from a lot of the defaults with the whole "bro culture" thing going on and am hoping it will help, since I let the comments and what not affect me too much. If it doesn't help, I'm probably going to leave reddit for a while, or at least delete the app from my phone, because for the last year, my depression has gotten worse and the main change has been my use of reddit that has gone up drastically, especially over the last several months. I dunno. I guess I'm just trying.    Are any littles... nonhuman? My little's "character" is a baby bear (age 5 and a half) named Meribell. Is name changing typical too? I also have a "character" that's a little who is a baby horse (age 4 and a half) named Ponyo. Is that at all common? Her "real" self is the big to my little and vice versus. Sometimes the littles play together and get into mischief. Does that happen for anyone else? It's also 100% non sexual. We're actually both turned off by the idea of including littles in sexual stuff. Is that at all common? I read the FAQ but I guess I'm a little confused about if we qualify?      She is 20, almost 21, and we have been together for over four years. She is likes to talk about fairies and princesses and has this intense love for all things "cute and chubby" as she puts it, meaning adorably pudgy dogs and bunnies and the like. She loves to tell bedtime stories before we go to sleep, which usually either center around fairies, princesses, or horses. She is obsessed with horses, but without a real desire to own one.  It's the cutest thing in the world. I can't wait for us to get married in a little over a week. I hope she never grows up.         /r/BoiFashionAdvice/  /r/MaleFashionAdvice tends not to help us out much, though their style is great, and /r/LesbianFashionAdvice is dead and focuses primarily on femmes. I created something for those of us who are bois, and fall somewhere south of masculine but not quite feminine either.      Edit: I didn't mean medical services sucked, I meant administration. Also, why doesn't the ACA help with this? Or has it just not yet? I get that vets shouldn't have to, but with the demand they may benefit from going outside the VA. I just feel like there is a lot I don't get.            Bought a pack about a month ago. Wondering what they'll be like and for how long.       I personally like to fall asleep to audio books. I don't like to pay for them just to fall asleep. They're free on YouTube.      My girlfriend and I had been getting pretty heavy before she left for work. We had agreed that, when she got home, sexy times were to be had. Since we are currently living with my parents, they have to be sort of planned.   Being a good girlfriend, I decided to wash our collection while I was in the shower, and left them out to dry on her towel, with it folded over. The family dog comes in, and, being the good dog that she is, starts snuggling me. When my girlfriend got home, I had shown her that I washed everything, so the towel was folded up, and everything was exposed.  Now I'm sure plenty of you are thinking that my dog grabbed one and brought it to my mom. That, happily, is not what happened. My brother came in my room to see if I wanted him to get the dog. After he left, I glanced over at the dog, and, between her and I, was a towel covered in sex toys. My brother just left and I'm hoping he decides to avoid talking to me until he forgets about this.  TL;DR I washed my sex toys then put them on display for my brother.   My soon-to-be-wife and I will be most likely attending Smith in about a year. We want to start a queer girl Four Seasons cover band. Anyone with knowledge or interest, feel free to comment!   Ask anything you wanna know, even if it's offensive. I will answer anything.               I am a full time student. I am extremely intelligent, as awkward as it is for me to proclaim that. My GPA is falling fast.  I am the only daughter and despite the fact that my father is still married to and lives with my mom, I am the one primarily if not soley responsible for her care now that she is disabled. No one else will do anything for her but me.  I work as a companion to a man with Down Syndrome. I have for almost a year and a half. I go out of my way to better his life. No raise or even a thank you. I work until 10 most Fridays with a 10 hour day so he can belong to a bowling league and I get no praise. The paperwork tripled and I can't keep up with it and everything else and I haven't been paid my hours in 2 months and my gas reimbursement in 3 and a half.   I am so burnt out.  Edit: I think I misexplained. I haven't been paid because I can't keep up with the paper work required to get my pay. I have to write the equivalent of a one page essay on the guy every night, plus the math for the mileage, and I just can't keep up. I was promised it would decrease after I complained, but it hasn't. It's my fault I haven't been paid.      http://imgur.com/bEEjvRg  This a picture of my stuffed doll, Baby. I got her 20 years ago for my first Christmas. She originally had an attached blanket on her wrist (left I believe) that was cut off from being holey when I was a kid. My understanding is that she was a FisherPrice doll that came in blue, yellow, or, like mine, pink terrycloth. Clearly, she has grown tattered over the years. I am hoping to be able to purchase another one. I have tried various searches over the last several years, and if you have any direction to offer, please feel free. Thank you.   I want genital changes and not really facial or body hair. Is this possible?            I'm genderqueer, sorta somewhere not quite sure, but I'd like to have the possibility in the event that I choose to medically transition. I am applying for Obamacare in a few days and I was just wondering. I live in Pennsylvania if it matters.   My girlfriend, or well, fiance, and I are getting married December 10th! I am SO happy. We had originally planned our wedding for spring of 2016, but recently learned that if we did that, she would not be able to get financial aid for college. We are having a quick ceremony with a district magistrate and then having a small party. We are announcing it as our engagement, and that's great by me. She's happy about it, too. I am just so happy and wanted to share.            I have been out for almost six years. I have been with my partner for over four. Last night, though we've had sex, even great sex, before, was the first time I've ever truly made love to a woman.  For the first time, I didn't emotionally compare it to what my expectations of sex with a man are. For one, they're unrealistic as I've never had sex with a man, and for two, it is so stupid to try to compare sex with a woman to sex with a man.  For the first time, I didn't have to fantasize to orgasm. Generally, I think about something I've read or watched, not really filling myself or my partner into any of the roles. It also generally involves a man. Last night, I didn't. When I tried to in order to finish faster, it made it more difficult. I didn't have to think at all; just feel.  For the first time, I was completely satisfied after I finished. I didn't really crave anything else. Typically, after my partner has gone to sleep, I will get myself off one more time before I fall asleep. Last night I had no desire to do that.  For the first time, I didn't concentrate on what might be best for her while she's touching me. I paid attention to me, since it was my "turn" anyway. I generally do whatever it takes to finish fast for her so she isn't left spending a million years on me. Last night, I just cared about what felt good and let myself enjoy it.  We discussed it afterword, and she felt the same way. She is the only woman I've ever dated, though, since I'm not even 20 and we've been together so long, it isn't that surprising. I'm the only woman she has ever dated. I guess there is still a bit of a learning curve, but I'm really looking forward to experiencing this and more again.                            My girlfriend has three little sisters; twin 15yo and the other will be 14 in the beginning of January. The twins have been asking my advice on skin care because mine is flawless (THANK YOU FOR TEACHING ME!) and they both have acne rather bad. The younger one has great skin but care isn't a bad thing and she's a copycat and would love it. Now, about their skin.  Twins; both girls have normal to oily skin, leaning slightly more toward oily. Both have acne, primarily in the form of white heads and some scarring due to their mother doing extractions. They are allergic to salicylic acid. Their goals are to clear up acne and my goal for them is to teach them the importance of skin care even when your skin is clear. Their skin is the opposite of mine so I don't really know what they need. They are on hormonal birth control to help control their acne as well.  Younger sister; normal skin that is clear with minor breakouts now and then but nothing extreme. Also allergic to salicylic acid, so my routine goes out the window dispite having very similar skin. She desires to prevent breakouts and be like her sisters.   If you have specific product recommendations or anything to avoid, please, any advice helps.   My girlfriend and I have been together four years and are 19 and 20. My parents are rather poor and provide housing for us but we are responsible for our own food and cell phones and we pay the electric bill. My girlfriend's parents are both very well off and provide absolutely nothing for her, including emotional support. Their incomes have both increased dramatically over the last year, and her younger sister is no longer a dependent so her financial aid will be terrible and she does not benefit from her parents' money at all.   We live in a state with same sex marriage and are willing to go that route, as we plan to marry next spring anyway, but we would prefer to wait until then if possible. Can she get declared independent otherwise?   My girlfriend and I have been together four years and are 19 and 20.

Can she get declared independent otherwise?    My girlfriend is the oldest of five girls and was born to her mother when her mother and father were 19. She has a very poor relationship with her father and a so-so one with her mother. Her three youngest sisters and her get along great, but her other sister, the only one with the same father as my girlfriend, has had issues with my girlfriend since we got together. She has actively tried to ruin our relationship and give my girlfriend's parents false information about me to get them to hate me as well. It worked with her father.  Tonight, we went to dinner at her mom's for the first time in over six months. Her mother was insistent that my girlfriend get into contact with her sister. My girlfriend has been trying to talk to her sister, but her sister has no interest as, this summer, when her sister got "engaged" to a man she has known for 2 months and been dating for one, my girlfriend texted her asking exactly how long they had been together. We found out about her engagement via Facebook. Her mother, after my girlfriend's explanation, showed my girlfriend ultrasound pictures with sister's name on them. She is due in April.  My girlfriend tried to contact her sister through call and text, she ignored the texts and literally made sounds like she had no signal on the phone. She intentionally went to her friend's house so she wouldn't see us. Also, she and the "fiance" broke up and she is moving 3 hours away to live with their dad next week.  My girlfriend wants to be involved, but was asked not to let on that she knew. She wants to see her before she leaves as well. We have no idea what she should do.   ---    **tl;dr**: Sister is pregnant and hiding it and won't talk to us and is moving away in a week.            Also feel free to share any other relevant information such as if it was your first attempt at learning the language, etc.      Ma'am, You passed so well that after walking away from you my girlfriend and I commented to each other on it. I assure you no one else was reading you. But I did. I read you when we made eye contact and you looked terrified that you thought I knew. It wasn't your height, even though you stood several inches above my 5'5". It wasn't your face, which was just as feminine as any other lady's face. It was your lack of confidence and fear that made me see any other indicators. I wanted in that moment so badly to hug you and tell you it was all okay and not to be so worried. Walmart at midnight may not be the safest place, but it also isn't the worst. No one even knew. You were just as safe as all other women in that store were and I wish there had been a way for me to communicate that to you. I hope my subtle smile and aversion of my eyes after our eye contact didn't further freighten you or make you think you didn't pass. I am proud of you for being yourself and presenting in public. I hope youbhave the courage to do it again, and maybe next time, if I see you, I'll have a better way to show you that I support you.   Signed,  The Lesbian from 2368.      We were riding in the car chatting about how, the previous night, she wanted me to cuddle her because she was feeling sick and I wanted sex because I was feeling horny. In order to not bother her, I opted to watch porn when she fell asleep. All in good fun, she was ribbing me about the fact that I hate her because I didn't cuddle her. I corrected her and said that I didn't cuddle her because I hate her is what she meant. Then, Reddit, I fucked up. I said "I don't hate you because you're fat, you're fat because I hate you."   I know Reddit circle jerks about how stupid it is but I don't know what it is. Please explain.         I'm sorry if this isn't allowed but I didn't know where else to ask. I work as a companion to a 29 year old man with Down Syndrome. Socially amd emotionally, I'd guess he's between 12 and 14, but he is illiterate to the point of not knowing the alphabet.    We have rules about his cell phone. He isn't to call me before 7:50 am ever. Last week we added the rules that on Mondays I will call him at 10am to chat since I have off and don't want to be up that early and if he needs to call and I don't pick up, he calls once and I will call back.  In July we had a big issue because he called me at 6:30 in the morning. He hasn't been allowed to visit with some questionable friends since. Last Monday, he called at 7:30, leading to the establishment of the additional cell phone rules.   Yesterday morning, while he knew I was on vacation, he called me four times between 7:52 am and 9:30 am. I chose not to call him because he gave up that privilege when he broke the rules. We spoke about it briefly this morning while I drove him to work and he says he won't do it again but I know he will and, rather than apologizing for his actions, he apologized for the fact that I was upset with him.   What can I do to help set some better, stronger boundaries and get him to stick to them? Games and stuff are fine as long as they aren't geared at two year olds or overly wordy. Thank you so much!      Eateries you like, anything gay, whatever.         My girlfriend and I (lesbians) have managed to acquire a JW lady who keeps coming to us. We couldn't turn her away the first time because she came with my girlfriend's aunt, who is a Witness. Now the woman keeps coming back and even purchased each of us a "Bible" and another book. We don't want to convert, and we don't want to stop being lesbians. How do we nicely tell her we aren't even remotely interested without hurting her feelings?   I disagree with 99.9% of the things Reddit circlejerks about.   I am a feminist, Chrisitan, lesbian who identifies as genderqueer.   Basically, the majority of Reddit's outspoken members hate me and the feeling is rather mutual. I have been here almost a year and don't know why I keep coming back.            Moving back with my parents soon to a 10' by 7' bedroom with 8' ceilings and three doorways. How would you make the most of this space?      We compared tongue size. When I woke up this morning I understood why guys compare dick size.                  I know you fart more because of contractions in the uterus also cause some in the GI tract, but why are they so smelly?  	136
 Um ... what? How is being a trans person okay, but being a cross dresser is too weird? I don't get it.  Whatever. I cross dress too, so I'd be totally into it! Sounds like a great time to me :D   I'm guessing I shouldn't click that link.   That is a really tough issue. In my current relationship everything works out because I'm not totally opposed to sex, and we're also poly so my partner is free to have sex with someone else if he wants. But we aren't married and don't have any kids, so I can't give you any perspective there.  What I can tell you is that you shouldn't feel horrible or that you're a freak. You can't help wanting to have sex with your wife - you're a sexual person, and I'm sure you love her very much. However, speaking from an asexual perspective, I probably understand your wife's situation better than I do yours. I sometimes feel guilty about the fact that my SO and I aren't entirely sexually compatible. I know that he wants to please me and share physical contact with me; that is a core part of a relationship for most people. Whenever we are intimate, I can tell that he wishes he could do more for me, but I'm just not that into sex. And then I feel bad because he feels bad, even though it's neither of our faults.  I think that's a key point here - this isn't anyone's fault. You can't help having desires, and she can't help not having them. Both of you are perfectly normal in this. But it is causing friction in your marriage, so it does have to be dealt with. If you've been married long enough that you have more than one child I assume you've probably been through a lot together, and you love each other and want to make each other happy. Start from there. Have a conversation about this with your wife. Remember that no one is the guilty party here, and have a frank discussion about your feelings. Be honest with each other. Once you figure out what each person wants and needs, you can work together to form a strategy to fix the issues you're having. This doesn't have to be a huge issue in your relationship, but it will only get worse if you don't communicate about it.   Exactly. This is something I've actually discussed at length in LGBTQ groups - all queer people struggle, but some gay activists try to claim that because there's no laws keeping asexual people from getting married (which of course ignores the fact that some aces have same-sex partners) and no one gets bullied for being asexual like they would for being gay or gets told they'll go to hell (neither of which are necessarily true either but it is true that it's probably not as common), aces shouldn't be considered part of the queer community. It's this mentality of "you're obviously not as openly oppressed as I am, therefore you don't matter."  Of course, not all people think that way. But ignorance like that is still a huge issue for us. Invisibility creates a whole different oppression dynamic. After all, if no one knows anything about you, then how can they possibly know your struggles or try to help you overcome them? I feel like being an ace activist, at least in my area, is first and foremost a struggle for people to recognize that I even exist. And that's pretty messed up.   Yeah, that can be tough. It's how life often works, though - you get unexpected reactions from people sometimes.  Whenever my roommate came out to his family, he thought that his dad's mother would be pretty understanding since she's relatively liberal, but was more afraid to come out to his mom's mother because that side of the family is more conservative. Turns out, dad's mom was really shitty about the whole thing and continues to tell nasty lies about him to the rest of the family, while his mom's mom has been his biggest advocate in the family and has actually gotten somewhat closer to him after he came out. There's really just no telling what will happen when you tell people about your identity.   I would say that you did. Who knows what could have happened if the situation had continued to escalate? The best thing you could possibly do is remove yourself from the situation, and in this case it was telling your stepdad to leave.  I can definitely relate to where you're coming from. I was abused as a kid, and just this past spring I had to testify in a court hearing over an issue that was completely blown out of proportion by my stepdad and younger brother. Family drama sucks, but it's especially miserable when your relationships are so incredibly toxic.  I'm glad you stood up for yourself and that your stepdad can no longer push you around. And I also understand why you feel bad for your little brother - I felt a lot of guilt for leaving behind my little sister whenever I finally escaped my family. She's twelve now, but she was only nine whenever I went away for college. I was always worried about what would happen to her without me there to protect her. But ultimately, you are your own person and you can only do so much. Your safety is the priority here, and I'm sure that if the argument between you and your stepdad continued it is very likely you or your husband or even your daughter could have gotten hurt. You protected them and yourself when you told him to leave.  Don't forget, though, that if you find out about anything bad happening to your younger brother, you can call child services. Most places have some sort of system where if they find out a child is being abused they can hold the parents accountable and remove the child from that situation.   One of the biggest problems with identifying as asexual is that so few people have even heard of it, let alone actually know anything about it. That's why so many of us go for most of our childhoods and even a large portion of our adult lives feeling that we're different but not really knowing why or how to explain it. I've seen people on the AVEN forums who are past their fifties and just now discovering the asexual label and community. That's a huge issue.  I can say it's definitely affected me personally, and I'm sure that others have had similar experiences. For one thing, I grew up thinking that I was a freak. I never had any crushes on anyone as a kid, but growing up as a little girl was tough because crushes and boyfriends are a primary discussion topic for girls from the time they're about eight or nine years old. I really struggled with feelings of loneliness and isolation for a long time, as well as my own frustrations that I should be fitting into the sexist notions of what it meant to be a young girl. I was constantly under pressure to worry about clothes, hair, makeup, boys ... and I hated every minute of it.  While I'm much more comfortable with myself and my identity now, I'm still usually the only openly asexual person that the people I know have ever come across. Coming out to people is so exhausting. On top of the concern that someone will reject you for being queer, you have the added pressure of explaining what your sexuality even means for the benefit of someone who has had absolutely no exposure to an entire group of people. It takes time, patience, effort, and it's a lot of pressure.  I feel like if there were at least one or two people in the public sphere that were well-known aces, in the way that there are now more and more celebrities or public officials coming out as gay or bisexual or even transgender, it would greatly ease the coming out process and other discussions around asexuality for the rest of us. Right now the conversations I have with people usually look like this:   Me: I'm asexual.    Friend: What's that?    M: Basically I'm not physically attracted to other people, regardless of their sex or gender.    Friend: ... That's a thing? I didn't think it was possible./How can you not want to have sex?/Are you sure you just don't have a hormone problem?/A lot of women are picky, that's okay. You'll feel differently once you find the right guy./Etc., etc.  Instead, the conversation could look like:   M: I'm asexual.    F: What's that?    M: Basically I'm not physically attracted to other people, regardless of their sex or gender.    F: Oh, I think I've heard of that before ... isn't [insert famous person] also asexual?  Considering how many people will deny the existence of ace-spectrum identities directly to your face after you just came out to them, having a few public roles models who are asexual would definitely help to ease some of that ignorance.   I've never been straight up told that I don't love my SO, but I have been told that if I did love him I should let him sexually assault me. There are some awful people out there that say stupid and ignorant things. All that really matters is that you and your girlfriend are happy, so I hope what they said doesn't get you too down. :/   Really?? A gallifrey cross-stitch name would be awesome. I'm not even into DW really but I have friends who are and that is no small feat. How could anyone not like such a cool gift??   I have at least 6 or 7 halfway-done projects right now ... every time I look at them I feel a little guilty but I just never feel like working on them, haha.   You're not the only one, haha. I'm panromantic so I'm certainly not limited to male partners, but a lot of people see me with my boyfriend and just assume.   Yeah, AAW is pretty similar to pride month - same basic idea. It's a week where the community activists try extra hard to promote awareness of asexuality as well as demisexuality and grey-area asexuality too.    I don't mind at all!  I don't usually tell people right off the bat when I meet them or anything. However, whenever I'm talking to people and discussing relationship stuff (which happens pretty frequently when socializing with people), I'll bring it up occasionally. This is usually how I come out to friends - just bring it up casually as part of a general discussion. I've been lucky because most of my friends were pretty accepting of it after I explained it to them, and now I can talk with them freely about this sort of thing.  It doesn't really come up that often, though, so for a long time only a few close friends knew about my identity. So as part of Asexuality Awareness Week (which was back in October) I decided to come out on facebook. That went pretty well too, because I could just link people to stuff and they didn't have to ask me a million questions - they could go find out about it themselves. Quite a few people told me they were glad they learned something new, and a friend of mine from back in high school messaged me saying that she was also asexual and had been too afraid to tell anyone because she had a bad coming-out experience once with another friend. It made me pretty happy that we had something in common like that, and the stuff I posted gave her hope about her own future.  Since then, though, I've still been following the same method of waiting until it will be more relevant in a discussion about relationships. Also, I've had to correct people a few times whenever they assume I'm straight because I'm dating a guy, and that usually leads to discussion as well.   I do the same thing. I usually like to knit or crochet in my free time between classes or while listening to lectures, so I'll get 20-45 min. here and there. So a project that might take two weeks if I worked on it like a part-time job schedule ends up taking two months.   heterosexual romantic asexual  I think the term you're looking for is heteroromantic. And like I said in my other comment, such a relationship is possible, although difficult. If you aren't comfortable having sex at all, that does unfortunately narrow your choices. But it will probably help in the future if you discuss your identity with any future partners. That way you can both work out what you're comfortable with. Some partners are willing to forgo sex, other times (like in my case) you can have sex occasionally but not so often that you feel too pressured. Also, a lot of people (myself included) have poly relationships where their partner is allowed to have sex with other people. That solves the problem of not wanting to have sex on your end, but also your partner's issue of being able to satisfy their physical needs. This isn't for everyone, however, so you just need to think about what you want and are comfortable doing.   Fellow asexual person here!!  First off, I'm glad that you've figured out your identity and you're starting to feel more comfortable with yourself. Unlike a lot of other GRSM groups, being asexual is hard because there is so little known about it. Many people go for long periods without understanding such an important part of themselves because they don't even know that it's possible, or they don't have a word that describes who they are. Everyone knows what it means to be gay, but very few people understand asexuality.  It's totally normal for you to feel a little weird about this realization. Asexuality totally flies in the face of most people's conceptualization of sexuality, romance, and relationships. So it's understandable if you have some concerns!  As far as finding a partner, don't worry - it's not impossible. Fortunately, more and more people in the queer community are becoming aware of asexuality, and it's starting to come into public awareness as well. For a movement that only started in the '90s, asexuality awareness has come a long way.  That said, the chances of you finding another asexual partner are relatively low. But there are a lot of sexual people who are find with having an asexual partner. I'm currently dating a straight guy, and he's very accommodating about my identity. The important thing to remember is that open, honest communication is absolutely key - both of you need to communicate your needs and make sure that there is no pressure or resentment when it comes to the physical aspect of your relationship.  As far as coming out to friends and family, I will tell you right now that it will be hard. Again, pretty much everyone knows what it means when you say "I'm gay" or "I'm bi" but not "I'm asexual." You will likely have to explain your sexuality dozens of times to various people, and they will most likely have lots of questions. It's good that you've been looking through a lot of research on the subject already - this means that you can use those same resources when communicating your identity to other people. The AVEN FAQs are pretty handy. Also, I highly recommend [this Huff Post series](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/06/17/asexuality-the-x-in-a-sexual-world_n_3444417.html?1371476630 utm_hp_ref=fb src=sp comm_ref=false) about asexuality - it covers a lot of things that the FAQs don't.  Whether or not you do decide to come out, I wish you luck. Just know that no matter what happens, you're not alone, and the rest of the community is here to support you! Feel free to message me anytime. :   True. A lot of people don't understand the value of hand-made items. I didn't really have a materials cost since I used leftover yarn that I already had, but if I were to calculate how much it would cost by how many hours of work I put into it, that scarf would get expensive fast.   I realize, I just thought it was worth saying - like, this is the exception. The point is put some effort forth, right?  Also, thanks! Crafting talents certainly open up a lot of gifting options.   I mostly agree. Although it would be nice for personalized wrapping and notes, it's also difficult if you're buying gifts online. I'd say in that case that people should maybe send a card as well as a gift, or even a message on reddit if you're really strapped for cash. Just let your giftee know that you put thought into your gift and you care about them.  Also, I didn't spend $20 on my gift. I actually spent less than $10. But in addition to the things that I bought, I also added a hand-crocheted scarf especially tailored for my giftee's interests. So even though I couldn't spend a whole lot of money I still put a lot of effort into my gift, and I hope they appreciated it. Not everyone has a lot of money, but finding something special or making a gift should still be an option, I think.   There's a lot of people on the internet lately who've been diagnosing themselves or their friends with just about anything they can google. I've seen it a lot on tumblr especially.  Also, it's been more and more common in the media lately - a lot of characters on popular TV shows depict some version of mental illness. Sheldon Cooper (Big Bang Theory), Dr. Brennan (Bones), Sherlock Holmes (BBC Sherlock), Sugar Motta (Glee), etc. Of course, not all of them are entirely accurate and a lot of fans misinterpret symptoms (because not just anyone can pick up the DSM and diagnose, that's why people get degrees for it). This of course leads to further trendiness and also complete misunderstanding of how mental illness works and impacts people's lives.   Exactly. People who flippantly say things like "oh I'm so OCD" for wanting to be neat or "I was so depressed" about something relatively minor make it that much harder for people with actual mental issues to be understood.  OCD isn't wanting to stay organized, it's not being able to control your thoughts and being so obsessed with things you know are completely irrational but still have them to the point where it's debilitating. Depression is barely being able to muster the energy to get out of bed and go to the bathroom or find something to eat - you know, basic biological functions - because you feel absolutely no desire to do anything. You just sit there, being numb and completely unproductive, and you don't even know why, but the deeper your depression goes the more you feel like shit for being a burden on other people. These things are not fun, or minor. They quite literally take over your life.  The other one that really gets me is how autism has now made it into public awareness so anyone who's even slightly socially awkward says they have Asperger's. Being awkward does not mean you have fucking Asperger's. My brother has that. I challenge anyone who tries to claim they do to live with him for one week and then see how they feel about it afterward. Autism is not a joke.   People who try to claim they have a mental illness because it's trendy can fuck off straight to another universe. Anyone who does it is a shitty excuse for a human being. I share your frustration, OP - and if I were you I would not keep this "friend" around much longer.   I don't particularly care, as long as it doesn't start to get super crazy long because then it's harder to keep clean and you have the awful occurrence of getting hairs in your mouth during oral ... ugh.   I agree with Diogenes. If you're comfortable, come out to your friend and then take it from there. The easiest way to find out if he's interested is to just straight up ask. I wish you good luck, and I hope the two of you are happy :   My best friend is into Terry Pratchett, the only thing I've read by them is Good Omens. I'll have to ask her if I can borrow some of the Discworld books.   I hate when people complain about others "shaming" them for doing stupid, harmful things. If you're doing something wrong and someone points it out, that's not shaming you, it's correcting you. Ugh.   I never flush tampons. There are some tampons that have flushable *applicators*, but that's totally different than flushing the actual tampon. I have never seen tampons that are flushable.  Also, pretty much from the time I started having periods it's been pounded into my brain that YOU DO NO FLUSH tampons, or any feminine hygiene products, because they will clog your pipes. If your gf seriously thinks that wrapping them in tp and throwing them away isn't possible or it will make the bathroom "stinky" she's full of shit. I've done that my whole life, never had any issues. And I've lived with up to three other women at a time who also have periods. For women and no stink? Pretty sure that means it's okay. As long as you take out the trash regularly it doesn't matter. It's no stinkier than kitchen garbage - old food is way stinkier than tampons.   You look so great! I'm glad you were able to afford the trip and the surgery. It can do so much to improve your life :D   I don't care, honestly. I would be totally happy if they were friends or if they got together. But yeah, the bear feels fjdkls   Exactly. How often do you read a medieval fantasy book that not only has just as many important female characters as male characters, but has women who aren't super-beautiful-elf/princess/elf princess types? Pretty much never. Except for ASoIaF. So much love for GRRM.   FemShep is best Shep. Seriously, she has much better voice acting. It's so sad that she's been completely ignored by all the PR material for the Mass Effect series.   Brienne of Tarth and Daenerys Targaryen from A Song of Ice and Fire. All of the female characters in that series are really well written and varied, which is awesome, but these two are my favorites. Throughout the books you watch Dany go from being a frightened young girl who is abused by her older brother to a young woman capable of toppling cities with her armies and leading thousands of people. It's really interesting to watch her grow and struggle with love and the responsibilities of leadership. I love Brienne because I relate to her more than probably any other character in the series - she is a woman who is not conventionally attractive and prefers armor and swords to dresses and embroidery needles. Her struggles with the men surrounding her, threats of rape, teasing, disrespect, and constantly being underestimated and worrying about being a "freak," are all so real to me.  There are lots of others but those are the first two that popped into my head because I'm currently reading A Dance with Dragons.   Yes. It's stupid. Your feelings are your feelings, and implying that someone is moody because they're female is just a way to undermine someone's feelings. You're basically saying that "you have a vagina, your feelings don't matter." It's really sad when women say this too, because it's just internalized misogyny.  In the same vein, I hate whenever I (or another female) is angry or upset about something and some douchebag says it must be because I'm on my period. Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't realize that I was only allowed to be angry about things while bleeding from my vagina and all the rest of the time I should be happy and perky constantly.   Speaking as someone else who's been through a similar experience, I realize how huge it can be to forgive someone, especially someone that has repeatedly done so many awful things to you.  I think what really made me come to the point that you have now was mostly practicality. After years and years of holding on to the anger, the hatred, the resentment, I realized that none of that really mattered. That the person I was holding all these negative feelings in for had no idea. They hadn't seen me in years; what did it matter to them whether I hated them or not? Either way, it would have absolutely no impact on their life.  I let it go. I finally figured out that I was just wasting all this time and effort and emotion for someone who didn't give a flying fuck about me, so why should I care about them? Not that I'll necessarily be overflowing with love and adoration for any of the people who have irreversibly fucked up my life, but at the end of the day *they just aren't worth the effort of hating.* That's really all there is to it.  So I forgave them and moved on.   Wow. I can't imagine how stressed out you and your boyfriend have been throughout this whole ordeal. It's always scary whenever you or a loved one has to deal with serious illness.  For what it's worth, I sincerely hope that you aren't positive and that your boyfriend is healthy as well. If not, then I just want you to know that there are lots of nice people on the internet who wish you well and will be here to listen, if you need it.  Much love and I hope that you and your boyfriend can be happy together, regardless of what happens. :   I would say that if your friend was already seriously pursuing this guy, it would be a good idea to back off. However, to me it seems like she's being pretty immature about it. Yeah, it sucks when one of your friends ends up dating your crush. But it's not like she owns him or anything. He is free to date anyone he pleases, as are you.  Regardless of whether or not your friend gets mad, I would say that you should definitely pursue this guy. You seem to have hit it off really well and if you're both interested, why not?  Obviously if you do end up together you shouldn't rub it in your friend's face or anything, but if she starts being snippy again or tries to raise a fuss over it just remind her that if she wanted to date him she easily could have asked him out herself. That's on her, not you.   *Extra awesome hugs*  I hope you had a great day too! And everyone else here. You guys are all awesome. Happy holidays, and I hope everybody has a wonderful new year!   I wasn't sure if it would accept it if the form wasn't all filled out. But I'll go ahead and do that, thanks!   So I've been tracking my secret santa package, and it came yesterday. Just called my roommate to confirm (since our mail sometimes gets stolen, I live in a sketchy building). I'm so happy and excited that my gift got to my house safely!!  The problem? I'm not at my house. I'm visiting relatives for the holidays. Relatives that live an hour and a half away. And I won't be home until well after New Year's.  http://images1.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20130616023724/dumbledoresarmyroleplay/images/3/3d/Red_NOOOOO_Gif.gif   Yeah, you could accidentally end up looking like a huge ass.   I've been in similar situations too. I'm trying to chat with someone and then suddenly other people assume I'm flirting with them or we like each other. I guess that sort of thing is really subjective.   What is it about them that you find cute? Mostly physical features, or is it more about who they are as a person?  I dunno, maybe you could go with gray-a.   I don't blame you. It was pretty bad. That scene was certainly not for the squeamish.      Gotcha. I will definitely get them as soon as possible, even if I can't read them before ADWD.   Yes, biology can influence gender. No, it is not the only factor. And most of the division of labor has nothing to do with biology.  I'm not talking about transexuals, I'm talking about trans* people. Many of them would be much more offended by you using such an outdated and heavy-loaded word. And once again, you completely misunderstand how gender works. People who are transgender that experience gender dysphoria aren't the only ones involved here. There are also people who are genderqueer, genderfluid, third gender, agender, etc. All of the people who lie outside the gender binary fit into this idea. Many queer people realize that the way most of Western society is arranged with "male" and "female" as the only two categories is a gender construct, and they do not identify with this construct.  Also, it should be brought up that a lot of evolutionary theory in regards to sex in humans is biased and used to justify sexism. And I'm not even going to touch your last paragraph.   You know I'd completely forgotten about it, but Cat certainly follows her family's words quite well.    you are trying to spoil r/asoiaf by bringing radical sexology theory into it  I don't believe I'm spoiling anything. There is no reason that we can't apply critical thinking to the books we read and have meta-discussions about them rather than purely discussing the books' events and characters in regards to future plot development.  Also, I'm well aware of the David Riemer case. I study psychology. His unfortunate circumstances are often brought up in discussions about gender or childhood development. What John Money and Reimer's parents did to him was inexcusable.   the theorist who came up with the idea that gender is a social construct, was proved wrong by his own empirical investigations and caused the depression and ultimate death of the boy he 'treated'  Actually, David's case doesn't prove that the idea of gender as a social construct is wrong. Assuming that this is the case completely ignores the existence of people who are trans*. Not to mention that it shows how you have a complete misunderstanding of how gender constructs work.  As far as biological sex goes, with the human species there is mainly male (xy) and female (xx), as well as many intersex people who have dozens of other chromosomal combinations. Sex is determined by genetics, and influences physical characteristics such as the development of genitals, and secondary characteristis like breasts or hair growth.  Gender, on the other hand, is the way in which people in a given society perceive sex and determine roles for its members based on those perceptions.  In other words, sex would be "this person has two x chromosomes, therefore they are female" while gender is "this person is female, therefore they have to wear these clothes and hold these jobs." Gender has no real biological basis; for instance, there is nothing in our DNA that determines men should wear pants while women should wear skirts or dresses. That is a gender construct.  This applies to Brienne, because she doesn't fit into the gender role society has prescribed for her - according to Westerosi society, she should be wearing dresses, getting married, and having children as part of the female gender role. Instead, she chose to take on a male role; she dresses in armor, has trained with weapons, and acts as a knight.  But your sorts try to convert everyone.  I don't know what you mean by "your sorts," but I'm not trying to convert anyone here, just have a discussion about what I see as a really well written character in a great book. You are the only person who is bothered by this.   I always thought that Cat was compelling because while she is a noble lady she is also a mother, and sometimes she puts her motherly duties before her duties as a lady. That's really what results in a lot of her rash, less well-thought out decisions; she just wants to protect her children, regardless of how it might affect politics.   Well I own the main five but not the other books, so I don't know how feasible that is.   I was wondering about all the other characters to, then partway through reading it one of my friends told me that AFFC and ADWD was originally one book and he decided to split it by characters rather than chronologically. It made sense to me, so it didn't really bother me.   To be fair, Brienne had to search a whole kingdom for one girl in the middle of a war. Of course it wasn't that likely that she was in the ruins, but she had to chase down the lead just in case. After all, what if it *had* been Sansa and Brienne had thought, "no that's not likely I won't even try." She had to take even the slightest chance just in case. After all, as far as Brienne knew Sansa hadn't been abducted, and even if she did know that it didn't necessarily mean she was taken to the Eyrie. After all, why would her aunt (who wants to stay out of the war) abduct her, rather than someone who wanted to use her for political gain? It just so happened that the person who did abduct her happened to go to where her aunt is. Don't mistake the fact that just because YOU as the reader know a lot doesn't mean that the characters do. It's called dramatic irony.   It was in Brienne VII, if I count correctly. After she and Podrick and the others got to the inn where Gendry and all the orphans were staying, Brienne went to go take Gendry some supper out in the forge. Then Biter and the outlaw wearing Clegane's helm show up, and start threatening Willow and the other orphans, so Brienne challenged them. The new "Hound" charged at her and she killed him, and that's when Biter attacked.   Same! The whole time I was reading the attack scene I was mentally screaming "OH GOD OH GOD OH GOD." I actually physically flinched more than once.   Exactly. He doesn't just show a bunch of awesome warrior ladies. He shows women who are forced to play a certain role in society because of their birth, which is really important, because not every woman can go off and be a knight.   Um ... yes, it is.   Well, there are plenty of asexual people who masturbate, or even watch porn. And not all ace people hate sex, either.  The key, though, is the attraction - asexual people aren't physically attracted to other people. So if you find people physically attractive, you probably aren't asexual. However, aces can still experience romantic attraction. So if you are attracted to someone's personality but not their body that would still apply.  That said, no one can really decide what your identity should be but you. I hope this all helps you figure stuff out, let me know if you have any other questions :   Well I downloaded the main ones as a set, but I haven't had the money for the other ones. :/   Same.   I suppose that's understandable. But honestly, I don't feel like everything each character does necessarily has to have a huge impact on the entire country. I mean, a lot of the stuff that happened with Sam doesn't really have a huge impact on the main plot, either.  And sure, we know that Brienne wasn't anywhere close to Sansa. But while searching we were also able to check up on some of the other characters we hadn't seen in a while - the Brotherhood, Catelyn Stark, Gendry, Podrick, etc.   But would you honestly want to read pages of dialogue saying the same things you had just spent chapters reading? I would say that unless Martin had something else that was new to add, or could somehow use Brienne's dialogue to put new perspective on the events, there is no reason to watch it all happen to her and then also hear her tell someone else about it at length.   Ah, ok.   Long car trip? Yep, that would do it. I've been trying to read this book while also studying and writing papers for finals, so I was pretty much doomed to be interrupted.   I've definitely wanted to check them out, I was just trying to finish the main five books first.   Fair enough. Personally, the kingsmoot was my least favorite part of the book. I have absolutely no emotional investment in any of the Ironmen; I really could care less about their politics or who leads them. However, it will be interesting to see where Euron takes them...   I've been picking up the series whenever I have time to read, so this book has taken me about two weeks since I haven't read every day. But it definitely went really fast for me compared to the other books. I'm not sure if that's because it's shorter - I'm reading the ebook versions on my Kindle so I really have no concept of how physically long these books are.   I get where you're coming from, but I have to say I disagree. By the time Brienne tells him her story, we've already read through it. If Martin had decided to repeat the whole thing by having Brienne verbally recite it, it probably would have become tedious. Instead he just sums it up nicely for us.   I'm confused ...   Agreed, it was really cool to see all those women compared side by side and the differences (and similarities) in how they lead their lives.  I think the only part of the book I didn't like was probably the Kingsmoot with the Ironmen. That part was necessary, although relatively boring compared to the rest of the book.   I feel you there. Every time I hit another one of Cersei's chapters I was like "ugghhhh gotta get this over with." Not that the scenes aren't written well or important character development-wise, but she is just so unlikeable at this point in the story. I'm so glad that Jaime threw her message into the fire.   Biter took at least two big chunks out of one cheek as well as her ear, and from the description of the wounds that Thoros gave she would definitely have significant scarring.   It was certainly interesting to see a more realistic and lesser-taken approach to the knight's quest to save a fair maid story. I also appreciate that by showing Brienne's POV, Martin manages to fairly adequately show a lot of the issues that women who break the mold go through. It isn't easy being in Brienne's shoes. I can certainly relate to her character, and I hope that even if she does die tragically she at least gets a little justice before she goes.   Well I know I definitely enjoyed it the first time around, no matter what other people seem to think of it. It was really fun seeing how certain characters thought and felt that weren't given a lot of POV parts before, as well as giving more/new perspective for characters that we've already seen a lot of. This is the book that really cemented my liking Jaime Lannister. It might not have huge battles or massive plots but imho it had just as many emotionally charged scenes that really gave you a connection to the characters. And what's the point of having epic battles if you don't care about any of the participants? Why should I care who comes into power if I don't have any investment in the people I'm reading about? If you ask me, without those sorts of scenes the action-packed bits would be a lot less meaningful or exciting.  Oh, and I'm definitely looking forward to finishing the series so that I can finally start looking into all the conspiracy theories and whatnot. And then I'll read them all again and look for prophecies and foreshadowing. It will be a lot of fun!   Really? I thought they were interesting. I mean, sure, there are some slower parts as far as action and intrigue go but they were really important for character development, so they certainly weren't just filling up space ...   Okay, so I just finished the fourth book this morning. I gotta say, there were a lot of interesting events in this one, but the parts that got to me the most were Brienne's chapters. Hearing more of her backstory and finding out the details of all her failed betrothals and the treatment she got from the other soldiers she was stationed with was a bit of a tearjerker. Not to mention that every time she spoke to Tarly I wanted to reach through the pages into the world of Westeros and punch that guy in the face.  As infuriating as it was to read about all the shit Brienne goes through, at the same time I'm glad that Martin wrote the scenes the way he did. Some people (who haven't really read the whole series, or at least not closely) criticized him for making a series so brutally violent, and especially so for the incredible amount of violence against women. But after reading Brienne's story, I believe that Martin knows what he's doing. How he depicts Brienne and other characters' reactions to her is a rather good depiction of how gender roles are constructed, defied, and the consequences of such.  I, for one, hope that Martin continues to write his characters so well.   The only one I can think of is Lonely Yuri. It's mostly just really cute fluff, no actual sex on screen.   I agree, it's really stupid to shame girls for liking "girl stuff." I really liked the Avengers, because I'm a total comic book geek, but I also think that Love Actually is an incredibly heart-warming and cleverly written film (and one of the few romantic movies I genuinely enjoy). You shouldn't be made to feel small or lesser because you prefer romance to action. It's just a preference.   I applaud you, sir, for realizing the truth and being willing to speak up about it.   Nope. It's just a pillow - it measures 16". Just big enough to rest your head. Although you aren't the only person who wants a bean bag Snorlax, apparently.   Well, the yarn and the pillow cost just under $20, so not that expensive materials-wise, but it did take me the better part of a week to finish. I put at least 40 hours into it.   No, it happened when I was still a minor. Something like this would be ideal, but I live in the U.S. so unfortunately it doesn't help me much. Thanks, though!   Ok. I'll definitely post a comment here about it, and I'll try to message anyone who specifically asks so you won't miss it :   The easiest way would be to just use a smaller hook and a much thinner yarn. Modifying the pattern would probably take way too long. I think sports weight would probably do it.   Well I'm thinking about writing up the pattern, when I do I'll let you know.   Possible? Yes. Likely? Not really. At least, not if it was crocheted. That would take forever. Now if I was sewing it would be a whole lot easier.   Aw, man. Now I can't unsee it either.   No problem! I hope you find it as useful as I did.   Here's the link to [my shop](https://www.etsy.com/shop/Knitin8bit) if you're interested.   I tried to make a very happy Snorlax. After all, no one wants a sad Snorlax.   Hello, all! I would like to promote my shop, Knitin8bit. I just started a few months ago and haven't been doing much because of school, but I hope that it will pick up soon as I have a few things I plan on posting over my winter break!  I'm really into video games, so a lot of what I make is video-game related. Lately I've been creating items that are references to Legend of Zelda, Animal Crossing, Mario, PacMan, Pokemon, and others. I also make some anime-related items. Generally, anything nerdy is something I can get behind! I try to make things that aren't just plushies (although plushies are lovely), but also things that have some practical purpose while showing off your favorite games. For example, I've made gloves, scarves, hats, pillows, tote bags, and dice pouches in the past.  Here's the link to my [Etsy](https://www.etsy.com/shop/Knitin8bit), I have a few items on sale at the moment. It's currently a mix of knitting, crochet, and a little beading.  Also, here's a link to my [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/Knitin8bit?ref=stream) where I post updates occasionally about things I am working on or pictures of some of my creations that are given as gifts (and therefore aren't in my shop).  Even if I don't make any sales, I would still like some feedback from people about what they think of my products. Ideas on other things I could make are also welcome. Thanks everyone!   Yeah, I have that sometimes, I just pick it off and go on with my day.   I made this using a 16" pillow form and some worsted weight yarn. For the body of the pillow I just crocheted a circle and made increases and decreases as necessary to fit the pillow shape. For the legs, arms, and head I free-handed all of it. It's super soft and comfy, and I got a yarn that's machine washable and dryable so it's pretty kid-friendly too. If you guys have any questions I'd love to answer them!  Edit: Wow! So many people want patterns. Okay, I will definitely be writing that out later tonight or tomorrow, whenever I have time. I'll probably charge for the pattern, though - does $5 sound fair?         I really want to make a hood that will keep my face warm in this awful winter weather. Will be making up my own design to look like the [traveler from Journey](http://cdnl.complex.com/mp/620/400/80/0/bb/1/ffffff/4a9b343e63fcfd6377ab5bad41b450ae/images_/assets/CHANNEL_IMAGES/VIDEO_GAMES/2013/02/journey_by_warrand4t9abc.jpg).   While some fans of any given franchise might be annoying (as someone who is a frequent con-goer for anime related things, believe me, you have no idea how bad it can get unless you've done it too), you really shouldn't worry about other people "ruining" the fandom or how people from outside the fandom view you because of them.  Yes, there are a lot of things that have gotten hugely popular but the behavior of some people in the fan base has driven others away (Homestuck, Hetalia, SuperWhoLock, etc.) and this is certainly a problem. However, if it really bothers you that much the best advice I can give you is just don't associate with those people and like whatever the hell you want to like. You shouldn't be afraid of judgement of others for being a fan of something.  Also, as a side note, I've never had anyone look at me like a Brony for liking Hannibal. Probably because it's a show about serial killers, so I'm definitely within the target demographic, unlike MLP where a lot of the fans are decidedly too old to be within the target audience. Even then, though, I'm not gonna judge unless you're one of those Bronies that buys sex toy versions of the plushies because holy shit why.   If you're really worried that asking him will make you seem like you're being really nosy or that he might take it the wrong way or something, there aren't a whole lot of other options. Of course asking him yourself would be the most straight-forward route. But perhaps you can have one of your mutual friends ask on your behalf? That way if it turns out he's straight you won't have to deal with the fallout of "Oh, wait, you're into me?? No, I don't swing that way."   Maybe just a little.   [Here you go](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/06/17/asexuality-the-x-in-a-sexual-world_n_3444417.html?1371476630 utm_hp_ref=fb src=sp comm_ref=false) :)   Sexual assault is defined differently. Check the link.   I second this.   Actually, [assault](http://www.ovw.usdoj.gov/sexassault.htm).   Unfortunately, there is somewhat of a double standard here. What you're describing is sexual assault. Sexual assault is not okay, and no one should have to suffer it, so of course you have a right to be angry. Someone touched you in a way you didn't consent to. That's not cool.  Unfortunately, while women face a lot of sexual assault because of sexism, whenever men go through it the same sexism comes back to haunt them. According to patriarchal thought, women are weak and should be sexually available for men's pleasure. So of course women get assaulted by men a lot, and when it happens it is largely ignored. But if a woman does it to a man, it's assumed that the guy should want it - because men always want sex, right? And even if they didn't, how could a weaker woman force a guy to do anything he didn't want to do?  This is one of those cases in which fighting sexism definitely benefits men as much as women. You might get a lot of shit if you complain about this sort of thing, but I hope that you won't let it stop you from doing it.  In the future, whenever a woman does this, you should call her out on it right then and there. Say "whoa, why are you touching me?" Tell her that's not okay. Because it isn't. And not doing anything when it happens reinforces the idea that sexual assault is no big deal, or that unless someone does something that leaves you in the hospital it isn't REALLY sexual assault. This is definitely a problem, so don't be afraid to stand up for yourself!   Depressed? Perhaps not. Personality disorder? More likely.   I don't think that wanting to get this guy out of your lives is partriarchal. It's wanting to get rid of someone who is increasingly becoming a source of stress, frustration, hurt feelings, and emotionally manipulative behavior. I'm not sure that straight up banning him is a good idea, because your wife seems to be a bit starry-eyed about the guy and might rebel against it just as a knee-jerk reflex. However, I would definitely suggest that you talk to your wife about this. Holding in your feelings isn't helping anybody.  You should tell your wife how you feel. Don't be pushy or judgemental about it. Just tell her that you think this guy isn't that great for her. Explain to her calmly why. Tell her that if your positions were reversed you would want her to tell you that you were in a bad situation. Tell her that you're concerned and you can't deal with how the emotional turmoil in her relationship with this other guy is affecting your marriage. Great sex is fine, but it's not worth wrecking your other relationships.  I hope that you can help your wife see that this dude is just toying with her. We've all been in situations like that, where someone pulls the wool over our eyes. But this guy is not healthy for her, or for you.   I wouldn't mind if they said hi or waved to them, maybe exchanged a few pleasantries to be polite, but if we're on a date you should be focusing on me, not someone you're no longer dating. Say hi and move on.   Honestly, though, even if someone was doing self-harm to get attention I don't think they necessarily need to be bashed for that either. If they are that desperate for attention that they feel the need to cut themselves, they're obviously a little fucked up and they need to seek help from a therapist or something.  	106
 A bunch of new concepts are being used for characters. I can't reveal too many of the changes this early, though.    Hey Dustination. Yeah, I came just to see what people wanted. The demo's likely to be out by July, though, so I'm getting some input in before we finalize it.    I can't confirm anything for them yet. Do know that I plan on including SOMETHING related to Super Mario RPG in the game.    Indeed.    Items will definitely return, and later we may implement those other things into a online mode down the line.    Thank you for this advice!    C#, I believe. Don't worry, nobody dies and we aren't going to ask for money.    It will definitely lean towards Melee, but with mechanics from SSB64/Brawl/SSB4. Veterans are definitely getting some updates to better fit their character or to help them in combat. For instance, a good example is Mario, who's recovery is being boosted and with a bit of extra power. This includes giving him a Ground Pound stall-then-fall dair, buffing the Super Jump Punch, and other things.  Many characters will receive changes to differ themselves from not only their console interpretations, but Project M and other fan game interpretations as well. It won't be Melee 2.0 or Brawl 2.0.    Veterans are the main focus currently, but there are quite a few newcomers that are being planned, mostly to fill certain fighting game archetypes and provide a unique Smash Bros. experience. The Balloon Fighter is the main character from one of Nintendo's original NES titles, Balloon Fight. He's recently been a trophy in Melee, had music in Brawl, was a featured game in Nintendo Land and is in the NES Remix games.    We're keeping it very low-key for the moment, when the demo comes out I'd definitely appreciate some assistance in patching it for problems. We're trying to make it the same core as Smash Bros. with the best mechanics from different installments, yet add enough new mechanics to differentiate it from any previous or upcoming Smash. It's likely the full version won't be out until after SSB4.    We're definitely trying to get all veterans into the game.    -There aren't any OCs in this game. All veterans are hopefully going to be implemented into the game before the final version.   -This game brings the best of each Smash game together, as well as introduce new things from other fighters and Nintendo games that wouldn't be in the upcoming SSB4.   -Our coders and spriters do. I've worked a small amount, and do know a bit of coding, but I'm able to manage the team efficiently and help assist them if needed.   -I'm trying my best to make this happen so that it's available on Mac, PC and Linux. It may take a while, though.   -Affinity is a work in progress name, it's based off of a new mechanic we're implementing into the game, but I can't reveal it until we can definitely put it into the game.    I have been thinking about that, and I'm planning on putting a lot of work into making sure animations are smooth and flow like a model would. This will likely give more of a cartoony feel to the game, but it fits the premise nicely. For instance, an attack to the face will actually affect the face, not just put them into a damage animation. Characters will react to their surroundings instead of just having inputs.    The problem is that, while P:M has great gameplay and SSF2 the pixel art, they both lack new Nintendo characters with moveset capability. This will be treated as a normal Smash game would: the characters from Nintendo's history and present fighting for supremacy, give or take a few rivals.    I'm going to sound stupid, but could you repeat them?   	15
 Came across [this woman's account of her attack](http://dayre.me/davienne/pLKsQpVoUr). She's also a young Singaporean in he mid-twenties and similarly, her attacker was a cyclist that came across her on a walkway at night.  Thanks for sharing your experience. Reading both of your accounts has reminded me that I should not take it for granted that Singapore is a relatively safe place. Heck, i walk home past midnight along dimly-lit walkways quite often without batting an eyelid. Not sure if I'd dare to do so anymore.   	1

Isn't it great he raps positive messages about the gay community, and wow a woman rapper!    Upstate is just Canada    Damn good, bloody good, Damn good game   Disrespectful American dogs are trying to disgrace our glorious leader with pitiful capitalist propaganda.    You aren't gonna be the wolf of wall street   I've found I only get attacked if I'm not moving, so in a way it's encouraging you to play, or get off your phone in my case.

He would just whip his dick out every show   Get a leather jacket and start smoking unfiltered cigarettes to go with that hair.    I also feel err will have a rise of offensive comedy too. There is always a counterbalance   I don't think you've seen a vagina.    Woah calm down.       What happened to the good ol punk rock/shit music phase?    Try and stop me. I have the claws,I have the power   Someone tell Sony   Heterosexuality has a terrible mascot   I would like to build my cat a tree and I'm just looking for various build plans   I thought race was just a social construction? When did reject that idea   Topanga had this idea   Wet bird don't fly   Why would you dress your kid like a thirty something loser who probably tells everyone they see Ruth an iPhone what shit they are   It doesn't look too much different than today. That's cool   I have no platinum trophies and it's bugging me. I have ps3 and ps4   Every sub is /r/atheism if you believe   Where did you get that? Link plz   My twin sister's had their ears pierced to tell them apart   It's like 50 in north Texas. Winter is here!   What does she mean a real sword? You cant bring a real sword to ren faire, right?   Your hands look like they could use some lotion.   I really enjoyed the nemesis system but never prgressed very far in the story. I managed to get evrything you can that doesnt unlock in story mode. there was just no push to play the story in that game   Yea having  books make you look more smarter   i didnt know onions were toxic to dogs. They grow wild all over my backyard and the dogs like to dig them up.   Or an Asian chicken flavored ice cream   It would be just like my basement   How is it still alive? Do animals not pass out from pain?   I would imagine as soon as they get hit everything retreats.    Yea they got him good   Do you want the syllabus and stuff like that? Every doc from my classes is online   If they put a fin on it it should be so much better   How are these made? Is it knitted and dyed? I would love to know how you get those designs in a sweater   It could of at least been something new. We don't need three gastropubs right next to each other   That woke something inside of him   A new pub is opening up on the square, in case the Abbey inn and loophole weren't enough. How many restaurants does this town need? It's ridiculous      There are a few posts regarding the push for $15 per hour. Of closer the objectivist.deem to be out in force. I consist this an important sub for us. Its got young people who are tired of capitalist exploitation, but many have never heard good arguments for socialism.   I'm a full time student and I'm working full-time as well. I don't have any spare time to do stand up. I really like it, but have only managed to go up a few times, and that was when I wasn't working as much.   SJW hate freedom of speech. They believe we deserve to always feel comfortable. Nothing offensive should be seen or heard. Everyone is special and unique, but only socialize with the group you were born in to.  To want anything else, or to feel offended is wrong.      But I don't have a gym membership. How do I turn my home into a temple?      I have several tvs and I have no idea how to optimize the settings. The picture looks different in all of them, but I have no idea what the settings do our what optimal should look like         It's been two days already.      After seeking treatment for depression and being on meds for two years I'm off and feeling great! My only problem is I feel like I can't focus. I'm more distracted and know for a fact my attention span and memory are not the same. Has anyone else experienced something similar? I have been off lecapro for a few months now also.   Where does this leave me? I fundamentally agree with communism and Marxism, but the violent employed by lenin and stalin are appalling to me. How can you justify slave labor and famine as means of control? It seems like I can't be a pacifist communist. Would I just be a socialist then?   I am looking for readings about feminism. I figure there had to be some people who have a real knowledge about it, not just stuff they picked up on a blog, in this sub.      I really have no idea. I thought it was about a girl who slept with reviewers for a better ratings for her game. Was that ever a thing, or just a rumor? Now it seems to be about women in gaming?   If you set all the pet birds free in America they couldn't all get picked off by predators. Then they might breed and we would have pretty parrots   Archery has always looked cool. Is there is anywhere nearby I could take a lesson?   I was looking to do some wildlife rehab or other kinds of wildlife volunteering. Can someone point me in the right direction?   Or wait for lollipop. I don't really know much about rooting but I would like to take off all the bloatware on my phone         And communism as well. I understand there aren't a lot of communists, but in my view almost all the worlds problems are socioeconomic. If we lived in an equal society we wouldn't need mens rights or feminism. I used to think that was the goal of both groups, but now I think they want to be better than each other. Both want their gender to dominate. It just seems odd and at ends with the origins of both movements.   Obviously we are gonna lose some people along the way. But basically we should breed bears to be smaller so we could keep them as pets. That would be easier than domestication. If they were like bobcat sized that would be awesome.   Why did he make the war on drugs can suck my cock?      So my prescription ran out like two weeks ago and I haven't been able to go see my doctor since then. First week was terrible. I had gotten off on my medication I've before during the two years I have been on them so I knew roughly what to expect. I thought I could get them this past week, but my new job and school didn't give me any time to go to my hometown doctor. So now it's been a fee weeks and I feel again. The brain zaps have stopped too. I am supposed to start therapy again soon, but now I don't want to go back on meds. I feel good. I.didn't realize I was.zombied while on meds. I've felt so many emotions lately and it's great. Had anyone experienced something similar? I'm seeing my doctor tomorrow and I don't know if I want to start meds again.   I was having the classic lack of diverse superheroes conversation, when someone brought up Silverman being white. I think for the first time I realized he's an alien, so that doesn't make him white. What do you think?   Can I just use sohangum moss? Do I need to mix a soil with it?   I picked some cotton the other day and decided to try and grow some. I planted a few in a pot and a few in my yard as it's getting closer to winter I want to make sure at least one survives. When it's grown what can I do with it?      Mens genitals would be unobstructed in skirts, and women's would be the same in pants.   I like to leave my pitcher outside, but I see squirrels around it all the time and if like to protect it. Does anyone grow theirs in a protected area like that? And if you do, can I do any other plants outside in a terrarium?      What should I include in seed bombs for usda zone 8? I have milkweed and wildflower seeds.       I live in Texas and from why I've read I can plant the seeds in pots and place those outside in sunlight. I also have grow lights. Would it be better to jut keep them under those 24 hrs a day? Also how many seeds should I place in a pot? (6 in)          I was watching cosmos last night and NDT described the knowledge that all things are made of star stuff as spiritual. I've always immediately dismissed the word spiritual or anything people claim as spiritual. Now that I'm older I feel that spirituality doesn't have to be incompatible with atheism, but I don't know how they can coexist. Thoughts? How do you define your spirituality? Is it something intrinsically human that we as atheists are trying to suppress?    He's upset with me right now for two warrants I have out for unpaid parking tickets. No reason I didn't pay them, just that I just didn't care about them. He's been telling me I need to get it together and I know he's right. I'm just too embarrassed to call because I haven't taken cars of the warrants yet and blew all my money this week.    So I've been diagnosed with depression and anxiety for two years now. I've also been on medication and attended therapy. I feel like I've made no progress. And I'm tired of it. Lately I've had the thought of taking shrooms or acid to see if that helps my depression. I've read lots of anecdotal trip reports where people claim if helped with theirs. I have experimented with psychedelics before, but never more than stupid swaying or mild visuals? Has anyone had the type of experience I'm looking for?            I really like warframe, but my biggest complaint is a lack of storytelling. The Tenno universe is so cool, but the only story you really get is occasional chatter from bosses. I wish DE would expand on the story more.       Preferably more recent writing that talk about 21st century communism? That might not make sense but I'm new to communism. It just seems that a lot of the suggested readings are a bit dated. Not that it makes them invalid, I was just looking for a modern interpretation.             The contestants would have to find a new romantic partner and keep the relationship going. The partners can't know anything about the show. The contestant that manages to stay in their relationship the longest will split a large sum of money with their partner 70-30 for the contestant; if the contestant breaks up with their partner upon learning they are the last contestant. The contest could go on for years, with deep intimate bonds forming. If they don't break up they win nothing. This contest will only attract terrible, terrible people. Which will make great tv.    I've been on lexapro for a year and a half now. I've been to therapy as well and I feel good now. Im starting a great job this week where I'll make at least three times what I make now. I'm also going back to school in the fall to get a degree in something I like. I know I need to talk to my doctor and gradually taper off, but what was it like when you stopped medication?   	116
 Taken down. :/   Oh dude, link it.   fuck no, fog sucks..   They may be in South Korea. :o   I came here before for them and no one gave, and I read that and came back again. lol :P   bold move, motherfucker.   Totally.   Hey now, what you think is gross i may find delicious. ;D   But its not like in Korea where you can't get certain things you want. I'd rather help someone who needs/wants it. Then someone who just wants to make a buck.      But I want to help someone.   I know that they only are sold in South Korea, but I would really love it if someone could send some my way. I live in Arizona and if you need my info message me.  I would be willing to send well, snacks, or anything you might need. Ex: toiletries and the box of chips like [this](http://i.walmartimages.com/i/p/00/02/84/00/04/0002840004026_500X500.jpg)  So if you live in South Korea and can get them, please, do contact me!  EDIT: Still looking for some. :)   Ill do it for some Oreo O's.  Just tell me what you want and I'll try and find it!   Fuck you.   SOH CAH TOA  Yay math!   Thanks, now I'm afraid to go outside around the house. As if I wasn't already.    Today, OP was not a fag.   Don't mention Tucson. Nope.   Lets just shhhh before you get down voted more.

Distributed denial of service.   More than likely is.   ...why did I read that, now I can't eat.   Its not mine, lol?   Only one thing is moving while the rest is still?   I know. Why can't they just use little cars.   lol you must be 12.  wholefaggot   Good luck, my friend.   Yeah, when *you* were a kid, not *everyone* is *you*.    pause   dude.. cats   WAS IT GOOD?  I hope it was, Pizza is the bomb.   So, how's Preschool?   tits   The 50th wallpaper is an edit I did of a picture, Glad you liked it! :D  [This is what it looks like if you can't find it on the gallery](http://wallbase.cc/wallpaper/2389483)  Makes me all warm inside.

Ya know, we could always lie in notes, be a bandit but write good notes.   Is it possible that anyone could send me some pizza? I live in Chandler, Arizona. Please contact me, I'm so hungry.   Thank you, I do hope I win! But I probably wont. :P   I have no camera :(   I did something, so its 2 people :D   http://imgur.com/2JoqE8B  I'm starving right now.. lol   [R.I.P](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saalGKY7ifU)   I didn't find that funny, at all..   Why, now I have to go out and buy it    Plot twist: It's a ghost of a victim.   Yeah I do understand what you mean by clunky!   What about ArmA? :( you can do all this..   It may be because it's late at night, but every comment is hilarious.    I just got out of a behavior medical center for adolescents for attempted suicide multiple times and this, this cracked me up. Whoever did this, I love you.   The pictures aren't WTF, but your hobby and enjoying of taking pictures of road kill is...      I'll test whenever you want, I'll try and pm you when I get home.   I thought it said "hitler potato" so I kept waiting for the potato, and then I went back and say it said "photo", I am not a smart man.   I'm impressed.   Chandler, Arizona?  Sir, I will probably see you around or have seen you.  :D   So ass then, eh mate?   What a brave ass cat.      Annnnnd, My names Travis. Great.   I'm numb. It hurts. Oh god.    I shouldn't be laughing while fapping.. But her face..   I feel like people don't understand it's an alpha. I understand that's no excuse, but come on. It's been out for maybe a week and you're all already bitching.   Touch   My name is Travis... Do I get a picture?   I want to, but then I'll feel like a pedo...   I'll say it.  Nice breasts.   I know I'm slow :( don't make fun of me.   Call me slow, but the Dota 2 "Sniper" has a line that says "Thanks for standing still, Ganker" just like the TF2 Sniper has a line that says "Thanks for standing still, Wanker"  Mind = Blown   Bought Legend.   Well lately my father has been getting paid less and less as the company he works for might lay off people. So in hopes of keeping his job now, he gets paid 1 week out of the month. I've played the beta for CS:GO but as it came out, I have had no money to purchase it. If anyone has a spare they can give me, that'd be amazing. Thank you.   Go home reddit, you're drunk.   I love to sleep. I'd come home from school and go straight into my bed. I like the warmth the blankets give off, sure it's not like a humans but its better than nothing. I also have cute purple panda stuffed animal who sleeps next to me. But on Friday, the 28th, it didn't happen this way. I had done something I shouldn't have ever done. I sent a nude to a girl while I'm currently with someone else. (Note: I did this before in my last relationship and, well you can guess the outcome.) I am the worst when it comes to keeping thing like this a secret. The guilt was eating me so I told my girlfriend what I had done. Needless to say, she was pissed. Now, I've only had depression or at least enough to where it stands out enough to be noticed and medicated, since my last relationship. I should have learned from my mistakes, but hey, I'm a teenager! Since I'm a teenager I jumped from point A to suicide. I'm the type of person who just wants to die all the time, and this whole mess just messed me up. I do already have my own disabilities like ADD and so on. So anyways any moment where my downstairs kitchen room was clear I would run an take some pills. In all I had taken 15 anti depressants, my last 2 ADD pills, and about 25ish+ painkillers. To my surprise I didn't die, I only got some pain in my leg, feeling like a baby was kicking my stomach, and my vision messed up for a while. I do wish I had died. I had found the love of my life, and well.. Messed up. Don't get me wrong my current girlfriend is amazing! But I have this connection with the girl I dated first (We will call her Kat). I just always want to be close to her and protect her. Kat actually wanted me back once but I decided to go out with my current girlfriend (We will call her Hannah). Because Hannah has liked me since gosh knows when, she always cares and asks me things, and also plays games with me. Kat has moved on, and of course, to one of my friends. I know I should get jealous ad or upset over these things, but I can't help it. I should be the one she sleeps with her head on. I do not make the best choices. I mean I usually pick the opposite of what's good for me, and I realize that I really wanted that other choice when it's too late. I've spent sometime searching the house where I live, for the gun we keep. But I can never find it and eventually end up sitting on the nearest bed and crying. I've even tried to over dose on my birthday, my birthday! I just wish I could sleep for the rest of my life.  If only my pills worked. They're just too weak to give me happiness. I'll probably make my own post tomorrow, seeing as I can't get on the computer right the moment, as its 2:45am and I haven't slept in 30ish+ hours. Good night guys, I hope you all have a lovely sleep, and wake up with a smile.   I wish I was a kid again.   I wish I was asleep.   ~ I don't think I could live being med free. If I still try to kill myself on the meds and with them, I don't want to know how I am off them.   Good luck, and have fun! I like seeing things like this, it's cute and reminds me someone can find love. Makes me all warm inside.   You better have fucking bought it.   OH GOD. THANK GOD IT'S COMMON TO HAVE INCEST WET DREAMS.   I thought I was alone and that it was weird. Whew, thank you OP for this.   Finally got the weapons and all skins!  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDrO_IK6z5U  Stats in desc. Just thought I'd show them to those who haven't found them!   Hows it a spoiler? It was annouced he'd be an NPC...      I know, I'm stupid. :D  This is why I shouldn't be around money, cause it'll be gone in a second with stupid shit.  I didn't mean to almost give you an aneurysm.   See, I was going to go with a 670, but I wanted the 4gb, and said hey.. 680 is the same price as a 670 4gb. And then 690 doubled fps of a 680.. and yeah.. :P  But thank you aphreshcarrot!   Could I just go with a GeForce GTX 680, Z77 MB, w/ a cooler?  I'd like to stick with GeForce for the PhysX. (Borderlands 2.. Yeah I know...)   [Build]  Current MB: http://www.biostar.com.tw/app/en/mb/introduction.php?S_ID=545  Will this support this GFX Card: http://www.geforce.com/hardware/desktop-gpus/geforce-gtx-690/specifications  I was thinking of getting a new motherboard, put if it can support this card, I'd rather not spend.  So, do you think these two will work together?  (P.S. I have a Intel i5 2500k CPU @ 3.3 GHz)  Any help is greatly appreciated! Thanks!   This is my current motherboard http://www.biostar.com.tw/app/en/mb/introduction.php?S_ID=545  Do I even need to upgrade the processor  motherboard, or will just getting the card work.         I'll take a shot.   Also, someone said I wouldn't play good, so thats why I asked here! :D   Ah, okay! Thank you very much mate :D!   Yeah, I just bought it and its not showing up anywhere too, I do have the receipt too!  I just want to make sure I have it... D:         I'll gladly trade my wrench for a rocket!   I am not in therapy and yeah they do.  	109
 Since you didn't use insurance to get your equipment...you should be able to get insurance to cover a machine in the future.   Usually it's about 5 years between machines unless it breaks and is unrepairable.   Just something to keep in mind if you are going to have some major procedure done some year....and the current machine is getting old.     I keep my old machine just incase the new one dies for whatever reason, because I'm going to bet they won't give me a temporary machine to tide me and I'll be damned if Im gonna suffer needlessly.    They can tell when you're awake and asleep...you're rate of breathing changes.  But if you wear it and can't fall asleep...or take it off after however many hours.  As long as you are ATTEMPTING to comply, they can't hold it against you.  It's their job to figure out why you're not able to comply....maybe the pressure is wrong.  Maybe you need a different style mask...  You can always call your doctors office and ask about it and see what they expect you to do...give it 30 days of trying then make changes...or change it after a week...etc   I know most of them will replace the mask however often in the first 30 days.    Sounds like they are charging insurance rates on your stuff.  If you got a 1k deductible and could wait until the new year, I'd let insurance cover it then your deductible will be taken care of the rest of next year.  Although I really don't advise waiting on something affecting your sleep...just it's always good to try to put big medical stuff at the beginning of the year so the deductibles are knocked out.    Wonderful, Im a big boob fan, so post post post.   Lovely.   Yeah I've been unemployed for some time now...talking 5ish years.  Gained a bunch of weight.  It ain't improving, that's for sure.    It's pretty soul crushing to be stuck like this, and I don't see how it be explained to anyone in a way that doesn't make me sound neurotic.  So that job hunt is only going to get worse.   Hell typing it out like this just makes it seem that much more hopeless.  Since your job = you.....to A LOT of people.   Free Zunes to all who reply? Woohoo.   You're very much describing my situation.  Except I am older and not "attractive".  Got friends with wives and kids, others who go out to sporting events, bars...etc.  I get anxiety from hell just going to the grocery store or a doctor's appointment.  I feel stupid about it after the fact, but it literally makes me sleep less for days before hand due to the anxiety and Im lucky if I can fall asleep at all the night before if I know something/anything is happening the next day.  And it is definitely not excitement, it's deep down dread.  If I have to go to an job interview......now that is where I feel like I am completely unprepared no matter what I try to do before hand.  And it's because I am socially inept.  The work of the job doesn't bother me, the interaction, small talk, dressing like others, eating amongst others, etc......horrible.  Plus I really hate trying to deceive/mislead people to make myself sound more confident/normal.  So that definitely does not go well in interviews, since experience tells me most people just want people to say they can do anything asked of them right away.  Have been referred to a therapist recently.  I dread that as well, because I feel like everything I try anymore is just a complete waste of effort/time.   No you are wearing it right when it fits good while laying down and doesn't fit when sitting up.  Gravity, relaxation of face, angle of neck all make the mask fit differently when laying down.  It should be very loose when sitting up most due to tilt of your head/neck.   I don't use ramp.......  Anytime my pressure changed +/-3 and I have issues with it either being too much pressure and trying to breathe against it when it goes up.  Or being the lower pressure and feeling like Im trying to suck the air in and the machine isn't providing it.  It takes a little time to get used to the change, and I find the ramp function just makes it more complicated.    PLUS most machines anymore have some sort of reduce pressure breath-back system, which I forget the name of.  When you breathe out it senses it and cuts the pressure.  So when you breathe it, it goes back up.  So it gets really low if you're using ramp.  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ This part of the machine is all I need, there are some models that didn't have it in the past.  I dont know about now because I can't remember what it's called.  But it keeps you from feeling like you have to breathe super slow all the time just to not be suffocated by the pressure IMO.   You've got excellent boobs.     I can't comment on all of the results as I am not familiar with the baselines and scoring on them exactly.  But I am commenting to let you know that they have take home tests to see if you are a candidate for a more thorough test (the one you've already done).    If they are willing, you may get some kind of evidence to prove it's an issue when in more "comfortable" surroundings.   Also, they have the ability to send you home with apnea machines that can do some monitoring and evaluation of events themselves.  I know some of the manufacturers have set people up with temporary machines when the tests weren't quite conclusive enough.   For how much better you feel it's not much of a trade off.  Most annoying part is keeping the machine clean.  Since after awhile you get used to it and kinda forget it's there.  I haven't traveled with it, but that would be the most annoying point by far.  Counts as a medical device, so you can carry it on...but then you know how inspections and stuff can go wrong.  If I was going to do a lot of flying with a cpap...I'd have to figure out a way to have one run off battery while flying so I could sleep.  Ain't even worth my time now to try to sleep without it, better off just staying awake for all the rest I get out of it.   What do you do now that is not enough?     Saw this and went through many more of your posts.  Thanks for them all......very hot.   If you said you snore, I'd say probably yes.  But there are other types of sleep disorders that I am not as familiar with.  Central apnea being one.  My brother has it, he breathes like he's whining at times without the machine and he often refuses to use it.  I have sleep apnea and I'll sleep 10-12 hours sometimes....some people just need more sleep.  You also don't say how old you are.  If you're potentially still growing, late teens or early 20s you might sleep more.  Or if you're in a place where you have potentially allergies going on, you'll sleep more since it's like being sick with your body reacting to the allergens all day long.     Boobs and smooth nice looking skin everywhere else.   If someone sent me that picture, I'd wanna see more.  I love boobs.   Headaches throughout most of the day were what got me tested for sleep apnea.  I'd feel kinda OK after waking up, and then have a craptacular headache the rest of the day until maybe 5-6 PM.  It got so bad that eventually I was avoiding sleep because I'd feel so much worse after sleeping compared to when I went to bed.  Thyroid can alter your apnea pressure ( I just found this out recently), and thyroid conditions ran in the family...so if you're in the same boat they will want to keep an eye on it.  PLUS there's the chance that while you're "in the range" you might be right on the cusp of the range and it may be effecting you.  Just talk to your doctor about it and make sure they are considering that your "normal" need might be different than the "average" normal.    Meds won't help with apnea, and in fact will probably make it worse if it causes you to relax more.  Because alcohol makes apnea worse for the same reasons.  Sleeping on your side can SOMETIMES help.  You should get treated because untreated apneas have long term health problems for your heart, blood pressure, etc due to your BP spiking each and everytime you "choke" and then dropping when you wake, and repeating all night long whether you remember waking up or not.   They used to treat apnea prior to the machines by giving people tracheotomies.  Which is basically cutting a hole in your neck and letting you breath through that hole to avoid the potential blockage area altogether.    Weight loss can help alleviate sleep apnea, but it will probably return with age due to slackening of skin/muscles.   Shouldn't hurt your readings if you have just plain obstructive apnea and not central apnea.  Some of the central apnea machines have tests for the masks that need to be ran to see if they will work with the machine.  These are usually easy to tell by having a little "oxygen" like tube running along side the air tube for the machine.     Keep using it.  They say to make a schedule and stick to it.  Personally I find myself super anxious about alarm clocks and tend to want to wake up before them...sometimes WAAAAAY before them and then get anxious about sleeping through it if I try to fall back asleep.  And I know it'll suck at first.  But I cut pretty much all caffeine out, so when you do "need something" you get more out of it.  I used to drink a lot of pop/soda and...it was very hard to give it up.   But you don't feel like you need it so much after awhile.   Keep using the machine for one.  But I also found that when I got into like...a pre-sleep routine I would fall asleep quicker.  Listening to an audiobook while I brush my teeth and fill up up the humidifier.  Then lay down and put the mask on, get comfortable and listen to the book until I get really drowsy and turn off the book and pass out.  USUALLY works.   Oh, and if you find that you're waking up a lot when you sleep or tossing and turning (usually a sign you're waking up and not remembering) try adjusting your humidifier up or down one the next night and see if you think you slept better.   The warm air is kind of stifling when you're trying to sleep, but it keeps you more comfortable once you're asleep.  I don't know what Nuvigil is......  you may look into the possibility that you're just not eating enough or the "RIGHT" kind of stuff to give you the energy you need to make it through the day.  Maybe try beefing up breakfast with eggs or sausages and eat a little more meat and veg for lunch.  I know if I eat a lot of bread or sweet stuff I feel like Im crashing later and it comes on as feeling tired and drowsy sometimes.    While you have great tits, I think your hair and especially your lips are really quite spectacular.  For requests....I'd like to see you smile (show teeth)!  And a profile picture showing off booty and boobs.   Arms above head pic.  And on all fours pic.  Both showing off the lips and boobs.  Oh and nipple clips, if you're into that.    Neti Pot or if that's too much of a pain.  There's some sprays you can buy that work similarly to a neti pot and can get them in various types to help get your nose open so you can get the mask on and blowing.  Usually once I can get my nose open and the mask on I don't stuff up again until I take it off.  	23
 I'm willing to bet JKR realised that her faithful fandom would bring this point up, though. Hence the reason that Harry became a horcrux.    I feel as though the Room of Requirement was a perfect place. In plain sight, however, for close to 50 years he was the only one who knew what it looked like. Incredibly smart in my opinion.    He used the blood of a foe (that for being Harry Potter, his 7th and final Horcrux)   Bacon, coffee, clean hair, and beer   In my opinion, reboots are inevitable. It's gonna happen. My only hope is that the reboots do these movies justice. Otherwise, I don't wanna live on this planet anymore.    I'm with you. Never read a single comic. But I love the movies. Like no other.    You and I not only have something in common, then, but would also be excellent friends.    Cloak and wand.   The only people I know who have passed, are at peace. I don't want to disturb their peace. They are waiting for me on the other side of the Veil.   The cloak and wand, they just seem like the logical choices.    Ah yes. Some of those plot lines were missing. However, I still believe it was the best. The final movie haas too many disappointments for me.    What issue did you have with the third movie? I thought it was the best done of the series.   	10
    Whenever I am in a large crowd, I always think that it would be a perfect opportunity for someone to go through with a terrorist attack. Not sure if this counts as intrusive thoughts, hyper awareness, or paranoia.             If you wanna be my lover, you gotta get with my friends.

 I never abused in the sense of addiction. Just in the illegality part.  I don't currently have moda (no script) but I do have Adrafinil, is this suitable?   I'm no professional, but I know my way around customs and drugs. I'd say just bring them in your bag, not in any container, just in the carry on/suitcase. Suitcases aren't checked as...precariously.   I have an incredibly bad work ethic and focus on work, I've taken all sorts of CNS (Central nervous system) stimulants. even Amphetamines, and recently I've came around to Afinil's. do you guys think these are viable option for it, if so which ones would be the best. All advice is welcome!   	3
 Some of the comments seem to indicate it's fairly new terminology.    Yeah, it's not the primary probability. We're mainly thinking it was exhaustion since it hadn't happened before or repeated. Also going to my PCP to run some tests to check for sleep disorders and the like.    The TR army grows stronger.    Hey I'm writing and answering it at work so no shame there. Thanks!   *insert physics joke that I'm not smart enough to make*    Internet hug for you. I deal with some minor anxiety, but nothing major. I'm involved in theatre and I worked for my college's res life department so I know quite a few transsexuals and know that in the early years it can be tough. Hang in there and if you ever need to talk you can pm me.    I've actually been suicidal twice in my life, to the point of almost acting upon it. What's somewhat fucked up is what stops me is other people. I've always cared much more about the well being of others than my own, and I couldn't stand the idea of someone I love finding the body.  Also, though I'm straight I'm going to co opt this, the hope and assurance that it will get better gives me something to shoot for.    THERE WAS NO AARON   Much appreciated. I find it funny that I posted this just to start a discussion, saw the cake and realized what the day was, did a separate post to Karma Whore, and that's going no where.    Hey I kind of like it. Made for some good jokes between my friends if nothing else. The official diagnosis is Dysthymia with secondary presentation of a Major Depressive Disorder.    Which is one of the things that we're looking at. I haven't ever dissociated before that I'm aware of and no one close to me has reported any odd mood/personality shifts beyond the normal, but we are keeping that in mind.    It was the driving home that got me. If I had run someone over, would I have even known it? That sort of thing.    It does... quite a bit.    We can agree to disagree here, I'm not gonna argue about it anymore, I don't want a medical flame war. I would consider a disease with a secondary presentation one diagnosis and one treatment, as did my psychologist, but if you see it otherwise, cool.    I'm working my way up to exercising. Apathy is the major symptom at the moment and overcoming that will be the first big hurdle. So said because it's hard and I'm also really really fat.    It's just the wording. It is rather absurd. But you have to laugh about it, I learned that a while ago. If I hadn't developed my sense of humor, I probably wouldn't have made it.    I was diagnosed a little under a week ago. And I didn't realize today was cake day...   Freaked me out pretty good. Hasn't repeated since though.    I wish   In that I cannot be convicted for it, yes it is.    While I am that, it is not the clinical definition no.    It has cost me jobs in the past simply by me being too apathetic to get out and look, but at the moment, and I can't believe I'm saying this, I'm luckily broke as shit. I say that because I have two roomates and a dog depending on me, so even when I don't give a shit about taking care of myself, I'm beholden to them so I can drag myself up.   But yes on a regular basis I cannot bring myself to do what should be basic tasks like getting up and going to class. I take 3 classes a week, I'm in my last semester, and when things were at their worst this year I was missing weeks at a time.   The exhaustion may be linked to the depression mixed with working a full time job and commuting to school. I'm glad to only have 1 more month of this.    INCEPTION   Back at you. Taking things a step at a time to learn how to deal with it. Good luck with yours.   It's like you just kinda move to an acceptance that you're always going to be the eeyore of whatever group your in until you hit whatever bottom you need to to make you realize it doesnt have to be like that.    We'll see. I'm starting off on the lowest dose and will move up after about a month, and keep doing so as long as that's effective.   One of my roomates refers to it as my double potions class. Seems appropriate.    I can see your point, but just because those precise two words aren't, the condition is so it is a mental disorder that can be diagnosed, and the diagnosis can use a colloquial name.    You're absolutely right now that I'm rereading it. Either the psychologist told me the wrong thing or, more probably, I mixed up some of what he was telling me. Thank you for pointing that out, I'll get clarification on my next visit so I don't sound like an ass.   At the moment we're starting me off on prozac. We'll increase my dosage until I get to a point where it's not helping or I reach a degree of normalcy. The problem with Prozac is there can be side effects including the little general going permanently awol that may need to be taken care of with other meds, but we'll cross that bridge when we get there.  If I hit a wall with the Prozac, we'll look at moving me on to a more expensive cocktail of drugs but hopefully it won't come to that. Prozac is cheap and effective.    You should. As I said above, if you feel like somethings wrong, I cannot express enough ho important it is to see someone. It could just be that your stressed and overwhelmed, it could be that you have a chemical imbalance. Either way it's best to get a helping hand before anything becomes too much to handle. I let it get that far a couple of time and it almost ended really badly.   Thank you, well caught.   See my quadrupal depression reply   It's no problem. I can't stress enough the value and importance of seeking help. Sometimes it takes a while to find the right person, be it counselor, therapist, or psychologist, but it is worth taking the time to find the right fit. In the mean time, if you ever need, I'm here and r/depression is here to lend a sensitive ear whenever you need.   They do have different classifications for types of depression like any other illness. The one that I have just happens to be two different categories mixing together.  The thing with any mental health profession that most people don't realize is that a lot of it we still don't understand. We know what does and doesn't work in terms of treatment, but the why of it all, (i.e. why does the chemical imbalance start, why do certain medicines work) is still all in the very hypothetical at this point.   Thank you! I'm on stronger medication and things are starting to get better slowly. There are more bad days than good, but the fact that there are starting to be good days at all makes things a little easier to deal with.    http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-JWdI8aKt8dk/ThRkkgjlyvI/AAAAAAAAAUY/arLCIieDxNM/s400/DontFeedTheTroll.jpg   ... Yes it really really is.   Double depression is dysthymia with secondary episodes of major depression. It's a clinical diagnosis.   No but it does come with a large sprite mixed with Holly Hunters tears.   It's fairly constant. The way my psychiatrist put it is, we all have good days and bad, but we mostly live at an emotional normal. A center line if you want to look at it like a graph. I'm constantly in the lower hemisphere of that and rarely if ever reach another persons emotional norm.  Put it another day. When an average person comes home after a long day; not necessarily terrible but not great either, and they're tired, somewhat fed up, and just want to lay down and rest? That's the happiest I feel with any amount of consistency.   The depression itself I would say is worse because I have a fairly good support system that helps get me through. The worst thing though is feelings of complete helpless loneliness. I live with a roommate and their SO. They do what they can, but there's still a puzzle piece missing that neither can provide. At least not without causing a much larger amount of drama than it's worth.   A couple of minor things here and there, increased lethargy, ambivalence. The major one though was a few weeks ago I lost 10 hours. I work in a place where my day is split between two sites. I work in one for 7 hours, and another across the street for the last two. A few weeks ago I was gathering my things to leave at 7, and then woke up at 5 o'clock in my bed.  The fucked up part is I seemed to have functioned normally in the in between time. No one mentioned any abnormal behavior at work. I drove myself home, and actually made an appointment with a psychologist, so I must have known something was not right.   We're not sure yet if that is related to the depression, if it was just extreme exhaustion, or if it's something else physical. More tests coming.      It's esentially when you have dysthmia mixed with a major depressive disorder.   Dysthymia is the more common thing that most people will get at some point in their lives. It's minor and usually non recurring, but when it does recur, it can be overwhelming and crippling. When people say they feel trapped and can never feel happy, that's usually recurring Dysthymia.   Double depression takes that and combines it with a major depressive disorder. Which has a quicker onset and greater initial impact. So when you mix the two together, it's like taking on someone else's heavy camping backpack while you're already lugging two armfuls of your own shit up a hill.  	43
    So I'm going to take an exam this afternoon that I haven't studied for. I'm pretty much resigned to the fact that I'm going to fail. What do you do when you take an exam you haven't studied for?   I would definitely suggest going back and trying to watch it again. It is intense...but worth watching!!    It's unclear whether it's genetic or not, but my family (from what I've been told) has a history of mental illness. I can't help but think that maybe without that, growing up would have been a lot easier.   	4
 I would suggest a curling wand. I have long hair and it works wonders for me. Some can be expensive, like between $100 and $200 but the one I have is ConAir brand and its right at the top of your price range. They can run for a lot more expensive than $40 so I thought it was a pretty good deal.  I suggest a wand because it doesn't have a clamp, so you don't get that annoying little kink at the end when you try to curl your hair. All you do is wrap your hair around it, hold it there for a bit, and let it go. It makes really tight curls or really bouncy beach waves depending on the size of the section you are wrapping. The bigger the section, the bigger the waves.   Also, if it's your first time using it, be careful! It's really easy to burn yourself on it.   That dog is so cute! I know this isn't the point of your post, but could I get a better look at your tattoo? I kinda like tattoos...a lot.   That creepy smile....   When I heard they were from La Crosse, I thought to myself, "Oh dear lord. I hope I know at least one of them."   this is really sad.    The best part is the empty chip bag.   To me she looks like Kaley Cuoco, I don't know if I'm just crazy or what.    Assuming you are referring to the Bible, I'm pretty sure that set of laws from Leviticus were for Jewish people before the time of Jesus. They are not Christian.   But if he said that, it would be interpreted as a pickup line and not a dig. He thought she was pregnant because she was *glowing,* not because he thought she was fat.    Smooth as fuck.   I came here to say exactly this. Upvote for you.   My brother and I are close in age, and my little sister is tall for her age and has abnormally large feet. I am 18 and she is 12 and her feet are almost bigger than mine.  Anyway, when we were kids, my mom always bought us all socks that looked almost identical, and we would all have screaming matches over whose socks we had. Pretty stupid.   I worked at this one fairly successful family-owned restaurant as a waitress where the two owners hardly ever hired men, made at least one waitress cry every day, treated the hispanic workers like shit, and where they discriminated against and harassed the pregnant women.   It was the most stressful thing that I have ever had to do. At the time, I was 17 and I had school, but they were hesitant to work with my schedule. At first they gave me too many hours a week for me (about 28-30) and then they gave me too little hours (about 10). Also, there was one time where I worked a 12 hour day and got one 20 min break. I'm not entirely sure about the legality of that situation, but it certainly felt illegal.   Also, if you made a mistake, the owners weren't afraid of yelling at you in front of the customers and they would also smack-talk you to the people sitting at your table. It once was so bad that the customers at my table actually stood up for me and told one of the owners that they were never coming back because of the way they treated their waitstaff. That day, the owner tried to fire me because of that situation. My only mistake was that the customer wanted pecan pancakes and I accidentally typed in regular pancakes. I almost let her fire me, but I needed the job and the tips could be great on a good day.   This is absolutely ridiculous. "What's the lasting effect on two young boys being sent to jail?" well what's the fucking effect of RAPE ON THE VICTIM.  Also, they made it sound like the fact that there was alcohol made it okay that she got raped.  And so many other things that I could just rant about     So that was terrifying.    You might find a home at /r/PiranhaFace       We broke up during our first couple months at college. I thought I was still in love with him then, and all I wanted to do was just talk to him. I wanted nothing more than to get back together with him. Then, later on he came to visit me the weekend before Thanksgiving break. We went to a party together, and I got drunk, but he didn't drink a single drop. By the time we got back, I was still a little tipsy. I got into bed, and he pulled out a condom and asked me if I wanted to have sex. Of course, drunk little test_subject8773 said yes. And it wasnt only the alcohol, I had genuine feelings for him. He had sex with me, finished in five minutes, then went to bed and hadnt touched me other than to put his dick in me. I asked if we could cuddle and maybe he could touch me a little and he told me that he was too tired and that cuddling would be uncomfortable and make him too hot. The next morning I asked if we were going to get back together, and he said "I dont know, my parents don't really like you all that much and I don't know if we should get serious again." Keep in mind, we lost our virginities to each other about a year and a half beforehand, and I was the only person he ever had sex with. That is still true today. It's not even like hes this big player who doesnt care about girls. He does. He just doesnt care about me.   "Kickin in the front seat, chillin in the back seat, gotta make my mind up, which seat can I take??"   Wow, this is awesome!    Only child?   Do you have a link to that AMA?   Mmm.   why is a repost this blatant on the front page.   I just got goosebumps all over just watching that. ewewewewewew   wat   Did she have siblings? If she did, maybe she was verifying her own feelings about them. Maybe she feels that she doesn't love her sibling or wouldn't cry if they died.    Not gonna lie, this would scare the shit outta me every time I walked into the bathroom. Even if I were the owner.   What a motherfucker.  	29
 I moved here not long ago and have already done the main things. Also went to the elephant house recently and stopped by a cool shop called Joe. Does anyone know any cool wee places to go? Preferably not including museums, monuments or anything like that. Also does anyone know if there are any cool themed restaurants or cafes or anything? Thank you!  Edit: Thanks to everyone who has recommended a place to go. I will definitely be trying to get to all of these the next time I'm out exploring Edinburgh City.    There is a girl who is an orphan and lives with maids of a house (its set in either the 19th or 20th century). She either finds an amulet or is in possession of an amulet. Either way, word gets around and a woman comes knocking claiming to be her mother, who takes her away to live with her. I think part of the book is set in Venice. In the end, the girl realizes that the woman was not her mother but forgives her anyway. Does anyone know this book?   she is saying how its hypocritical that her mum won't allow her birth control (because its against Catholicism) yet her mum is a lesbian (which is also against Catholicism)   I have avoided talking about personal things and my true feelings since I can remember and am really anxious about my doctor's appointment today. Just to be prepared I have printed out a PHQ and filled it in but I'm still really nervous and panicky. Any tips?  EDIT: Thanks everyone! I had my appt. and it went really well. She was straightforward, actually listened to me and then gave me a perscription and told me to use my free uni councelling service. It really helped that I braught with me the PHQ. I now have a perscription for fluoxetine.  	4
 Happy coupon and 3 coal!  	1
 We made it to the table of 32. But still... HAIL SOUTHERN   [Next year we get the Cure Bowl in Orlando against an AAC team](http://curebowl.com)  The fifth bid starting in 2016 is actually gonna be on a rotational basis between a handful of conferences.    Sun Belt gets a fourth bowl bid next year, and a fifth after that. But Georgia Southern and CrApp State will be eligible so Texas might miss out again. :P   Yeah Georgia Southern is just buried in that article. :(   Lol Georgia Southern went 9-3 in their first season in the FBS and came within a score of beating both our ACC opponents this season. We ain't no cupcake team.   Aww sorry Sam Houston Bro. :( We are taking good care of him!   HAIL SOUTHERN :)   LOL I never thought about it that way but you are right. :)      Ooh that's neat! I like the buddy ticket idea. I'm sad you can't sit on the hill anymore though. :(   I work for UA Museums. Love it!    When I was at Georgia Southern (I graduated in '12) the football games were free if you paid your athletic fee (about 150? but it included other things like renovation costs and the rec center access too).  I work for the University of Alabama and they run a fac/staff season ticket lottery based on seniority. You have to buy the whole season.   Why not State of Georgia University Panthers?   [Here this friendly PSA should clear up any confusion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=putYM15zC0Y feature=youtu.be)   [NO](http://mylolface.com/assets/faces/angry-no.jpg)   I get so sad that people still get confused by this. :(   Overall an exemplary season for the Panthers. They do a good job keeping Paulson North warm for us.   Hey they did their best to only win by one point. Don't be too hard on em.   Awesome. That makes me happy.   GSU AD actually reached out to the NCAA about doing it. Betcha can guess what those bastards said. :(   NCAA- Not Controlling Athletics Association /s   Kleinlein is a stand up guy.      All of them. The answer is all of them.   I bet someone down Auburn way might take him. ;)   I'm glad we could help you guys reach 15,006 average attendance.    OK I'm gonna use Alabama, because I work there. [They had eight players drafted in 2014](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Alabama_Crimson_Tide_players_in_the_NFL_draft).  Their starting kicker, Cade Foster, was not among them. He is now a free agent.   Players like that, who don't get drafted yet expected to. What kind of a future can they look forward to? What's the likelihood they will get picked up? Do they have skills they can fall back on if not? I'm legitimately concerned. The graduation - employment rate is low enough as it is. I should know I am a (gainfully employed!) recent anthropology grad. :)   If their coaches are not properly educating their players about what a long shot it is (about 3% according to the NCAA website, but that's across all divisions) then they are doing those kids a disservice. I'd really like to know what happens to the kid who stakes all his hopes on getting into the NFL and prepared for no other option. What does he do? Flip burgers?   Yeah but they're not all gonna get drafted.    I enjoyed the analysis of this article and I'd like to see the data from other Universities. I feel like this should all be public information for any public institution.   I always implore our defense to squish 'em, but I never claimed to not be weird.   GREATEST THING   Georgia Southern was the first team to be undefeated in conference/outright champs in the first year of transition since the rule was made.   Still sad panda. :(   I read somewhere that ODU wasn't eligible either because of transition.   I think you got down votes because most Georgia Southern Fans don't think very highly of UGA even though we can't really be considered football 'rivals.' A lot of it goes way back to when Erk Russell left UGA to start our program. Some of it has to do with how hard they fought to block us becoming a University as well. We like Tech though.   HAIL SOUTHERN   YES   Yes, that is also a good one because it shows us being classy in our celebrations.   So we should change it to mountain goats, or what?   LOL @ CrApp State Sheep and Sad Georgia State ball. :)   [HAIL SOUTHERN](https://fbcdn-sphotos-f-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xpf1/v/t1.0-9/p480x480/10421115_10152812749846855_9028560074656845079_n.jpg?oh=591fc03693b7a45af29c151ac707d387 oe=55017D71 __gda__=1430674023_d16d004edd682d0c816bc97dcbf5c0b9)   I would attend this game.  However wouldn't Georgia Southern get in trouble? :(   The difference is Georgia Southern went 8-0 in conference play and holds an outright championship.  EDIT TO ADD- And we are the first team to have done so since the rule was implemented.   Almost like they are rewarding certain conferences for having an actual championship game... Hmmm ;)   Those boys are not giving up... LOVE IT GO JACKETS   This happens with cameramen inexperienced with the Option    He didn't learn it at Southern....he just coached it there first  aight   Truth. Although that game made me sad face.   I believe we face both your flairs next season :)   Gators.   Everyone in here like 'WOO GT's OFFENSE' but CPJ learned it at Georgia Southern   Samesies   No passing, no problem budday   OK Drink get nekkid   Time to WRECK THE NOLES  	55
 I'm not good at showing emotions so I just ate them and said how great they were.     My sister thinks I'm going through a phase and am crazy, yet at the same time she is one of my supporters.    Exactly. My parents keep vegetarian burgers, lasagnas, etc in the freezer for when I come home to visit. It's nice then even though I don't live with them, they want to make sure I have quick and easy access to food when I'm around.    I've been a fish eating vegetarian (pescatarian) for about 10 months now and the hardest part is family gatherings especially around holidays. Today is my family's Christmas get together and for Christmas we do a lot of finger foods: meatballs, ham rollups, veggies, etc. One of my favorite foods are my mom's ham rollups. I could easily eat a whole platter. I have never asked my family to change their recipes or make special accomodations for me - it's never been an issue finding something to munch on. Well today as we are setting the table, I notice something different, my mom made vegetarian ham rollups. Instead of wrapping the pickle and cream cheese spread in ham, she wrapped them in a spinach leaf. They tasted so good, even some of my meat eating family were snacking on them, I actually had to make sure I got some because the regular ham rollups were being ignored.   This small gesture meant a lot to me, and I just wanted to share with you how awesome my mom is.    Inconceivable!    I'm sorry. I suppose I have some pretty understanding friends/family. I've received some grief from meat eaters, but I tend to brush it off and move on. I also found not mentioning it helps. Many of my friends don't even realize I'm pescatarian. Got to be stealthy. ;)    I'm pescatarian and it makes it easier. Make fish or order fish at a restaurant is easier than ordering vegetarian or vegan. My family loves that I'm not full out vegetarian because they can cook one meal everyone will eat.   WARNING: Has the emotional stability of an 8 year old.    Do you still need six and seven?   I know the feeling. I actually deleted my Facebook a couple months ago and it was the best thing for me.  I've gotten closer with my few close friends, I've stopped worrying about what is going on in the lives of people who I used to know and comparing them to myself. I've even had some old friends reach out through phone calls and texts to see what's new in my life. The things I would want to post and sometimes did post, I now turn to my friends about and they've been a lot more helpful than I'd ever imagine.    As a Stephen King fan, I am super jealous. I own maybe ten of his books, but my goal is to have a Stephen King bookshelf one day. Thanks for sharing. :)    You are correct. Anyone can call themselves a nutritionist, but a dietician requires school, internship, and then an exam to become certified.   Source: Once was a Dietetic major.   I will. Thank you!    Thank you.   Thank you for sharing what you went through. It's nice to know others have gone through the same thing.   I've started searching for a good psychiatrist near me.   Funny you should mention reading. Growing up I'd escape inside a book daily, but with school and work I haven't found time lately. Well last night I pushed everything aside and read just a few chapters of a non school related book. I've missed that.    I've contemplated driving recklessly into a tree.   To me up north was always the UP.   Mt pleasant is not up north....is it?   That's why I generally resort to saying "I'm tired" or "I'm stressed"    True, I wouldn't want to put someone through that.    Thank you so much for taking the time to respond to all my questions. It really means a lot. :)   I've gone to the free services on campus before, but they don't really know how to deal with things like this. You get x amount of free visits and they are more for homesickness, help adjusting to college, balancing work and school, and various things like that. Their advice to me was "get involved on campus" and you'll feel better. Not really helpful in my case. :/    Thank you. I'm not ready to give up yet.    Getting hit by a car is another one that crosses my mind sometimes.    Have you had any negative side effects from taking GABA?   Thank you for sharing what worked for you. :)    Same here.    Couldn't have said it better myself.    I work out when I can, could probably do it more often though.   Slightly afraid of AD side effects, but also against the idea of them in general  - I don't like taking medication in general.   	28
 My grandpas both died before I was born, but my little brother talks about them all the time. Apparently, he goes to his grandpas house and does all kinds of cools things, and sometimes he cries because he misses his grandpa.  	1
 The whole concept of a neg doesn't fucking work. If someone told me I was ugly, would you seriously expect me to start taking off my clothes and exposing myself? No, I'd run and hide and never have sex again.    I think there are a huge number of men who are attracted to shy women.    Would people in this thread like to answer their own questions? It could make things quite interesting.   "What are the signs that a girl likes a guy?"  Bi-weekly at least.   Can we sidebar something like this? I see these threads at least once a week, from both genders in both subreddits, and the answers are always the same - followed by 'just go for it and ask him/her already.'   Can someone translate this please?   I tend to find that the 'spark' doesn't appear until you are comfortable with the person - particularly when you're actually going out. If you asked him out (I assume he'll say yes) and both of you relax, you will have a lot more fun together. The awkwardness will disappear when he doesn't feel he constantly has to impress you (which he does if he likes you).  Also, the 'chemistry' mentioned in movies can be exaggerated, and is better labelled as 'having fun in their company.' Expecting some strange and magical feeling of love at first sight to suddenly strike you down is quite simply not going to happen.   Maybe he's one of the 64   bend over backwards for them  Well there's your problem. Sorry mate, but you're about to hear some harsh truths.   You're a *nice guy* - otherwise referred to as the most unattractive object in the world. Sorry. There's an excellent guide to helping you in r/askwomen or something, and I'll link you to it when I'm not on my phone, unless somebody helpful will do it for me.   Basically you're coming across totally wrong - in your desire to not be a loser, you're making yourself even more so. Rather than conveying 'a sensitive, caring guy who just wants love,' you're putting across 'needy, possibly obsessive, and high maintenance with very low self-esteem.'  they say I'll find somebody  Can you please elaborate more on the conversation leading up to this? It will help us dissect what you're saying wrong.   I have no doubt that you're a great guy with a lot to offer a girl - and you *need* to believe this too - but the way you're conveying yourself is unfortunately of a weak, needy... loser.    I would hope so, seeing as they're married.    /r/malefashionadvice   - Rob Thomas   The fuck? Since when was violin less cool than flute? And I'm pretty sure even professional musicians who are male flautists still get ridiculed.   I played Trombone in high school. If I hadn't also been able to sing my dorkness would have been over 9000.    Well, the person who stole it does.    If you want him, you need to put in some effort and step outside your comfort zone. It's as simple as that.    r/seduction would have an apoplexy if the guy gave a girl his number. But I think it builds a bit of trust and makes you look less like yore just trying to get in her pants. Opinions, anybody?   There's such an emphasis on males upholding this side of a relationship - he must always tell you you're beautiful, that you look nice, etc. etc. or he's not worth being with - but it never goes both ways.   Well laaa di dah    Or that something has gone wrong.    Dolce et decorum est   I don't think there should be conscription for anyone, but I think we can have gender equality long before we have world peace, so I'm working on achievable goals.    I didn't say I was *right*.   While I am all for feminism, this has always irritated me. You can't seriously expect women to have an equal place to men in society when we can be forced to kill and to die, and you can't.    So by that maths, Afghanistan has -1 health care systems?   I'm a historian, and I don't agree.    If you did the cover a long time ago, how can you be a new player/singer?   I suppose at 18 I'm not really old enough to say 'I know how you feel,' but I'm going to anyway.  I don't know what's wrong with me. I always try to be outgoing, happy and fun, I have numerous friends (mostly female, in fact) in several circles who think I'm funny and good company, I go well out of my way to ensure people around me are happy. I dress as well as I can afford (thank you MFA), I always try to be polite, and I don't think I'm stupid. I'm a paid, professional singer, and I can play guitar. I have no problems approaching girls and talking to them, and I don't think I'm boring - even so, I've studied r/socialskills intently. Sounds good on paper, right?  Wrong.   I have always been the third wheel, for my entire life. I had one girlfriend for two months, who seriously fucked me over emotionally and then cheated on me with some sixteen year old cunt. My friends and hers (who are no longer her friends) all agree that I did everything perfectly - was understanding, supportive, romantic; in one girl's words "the perfect boyfriend." Besides her, not a single girl has ever shown interest in me, and whenever I try to initiate - which I do on a DAILY basis - they always make it more than clear that they're not interested. I've joined clubs and pursued hobbies, I've taken ballroom dancing classes, am involved in more musical ensembles than is healthy for my sanity. I go out drinking/dancing/clubbing; every person in the group will hook up with someone - except me. It doesn't matter. I meet so many people, and I'm friends with most of them almost instantly, but NONE of them ever display any interest in me beyond that.   I've concluded that I'm ugly, which makes me a little sad, because there's nothing I can do about it (besides plastic surgery - fuck that shit), so I'm stuck being lonely for the rest of my life.   P.S. I don't whinge about the 'friendzone' because that attitude is pathetic, but when a girl you really like refers to you as her Gay Best Friend it stings.    Am I the only person in the world that finds something to talk about, and doesn't just say 'hey'?   Quiet... drama girl? Quiet drama people exist?   Or where he fits in Kara!   SIMBA   Don't feel like you should *have* to kiss etc, as if it's not a real relationship without it. If you're comfortable just being with each other, so much the better.    Being in a relationship is just like being really good friends, but with sex. If you're not having sex yet (totally understandable at her age, and it's important not to pressure her) then you don't even need to worry about that. Hang out, go to movies and shit, do whatever you would normally with other friends. Don't have sexual contact with anyone besides her. There is an implicit emotional connection; you will probably be her go-to person for emotional support, and likewise.   The bottom line: have fun. It should be about opportunities, not duties.    Shirts three sizes too big on girls are EXTREMELY flattering.    Wait, so the baby had down's syndrome, was fathered by an ex boyfriend, who was the daddy?  Or the girl had down's syndrome and her dad, who was not only her ex but also a baby, was wailing in the car?   Dude. She's talking about sex stories with you. Clear sign that (to quote Superbad) she wants your dick, in and around her mouth.   All you have to do now is make a move and go get some!   If you approach him, it will make his day. His week. His life.   He's probably beating himself up about not having the confidence to approach you, but if you give him a lead in he'll most likely gain a ton of it. And it'll put a smile on his face for a month.   EDIT: if what you're saying about the looking and looking away is true, then he likes you. No doubt. This is a classic for shy guys.    Can I ask why he is being downvoted? I make these kind of jokes all the time - especially when girls are talking about girl things, like waxing their legs etc - and they're great for a quick laugh.  And the bottom line of social skills is that once you've shared a joke with someone your relationship with them will never be the same. It's the oldest form of connection (besides probably sex) in human history.    By 'went back to his place' I'm assuming you mean you slept with him - in which case, if he doesn't contact you and does a hit  amp; quit, then he's a dickhead and not worth being with anyway. If he's not, he will!  EDIT: I have absolutely no problems with her sleeping with anyone, it just affects the situation.    I think she's using 'stalk' lightheartedly. I certainly do when talking about Facebook, and I hear it constantly from other people.    With notable exceptions on both sides, I find particularly attractive people to be less giving in all walks of life. Not that they're unkind, but less attractive people are more likely to go well out of their way for other people, because unfortunately they have to.    I DON'T CARE WHERE YOU ARE OR WHAT YOU'RE DOING. SIT THE FUCK DOWN AND WRITE PART 2. NOW.  AND PART 3, AND PART 4, AND PART 5.   You said that everybody has left and there is nobody in your town like you - this is a bit of a defeatist attitude and not be done lightly, but have you considered leaving too?  EDIT: As an artsy person who found great happiness in the big smoke   I really loved this comment, but how does it relate to kissing?   I've need seen it used in a sentence, so perhaps the Supine is just the 'dictionary' form of the Participle?   What if another rocket fails and they don't want us to know?   I'm currently doing Latin at University, and we learned (just last week actually) that the Participle is derived from the Supine form, but the Supine is still used as the Principal Part. That's from the Cambridge Latin textbook.    That's the next line of the song.    Coz papa's gonna be bringing' home the... gingerbread!   Latin verbs have four principle parts - the Present Indicative Active, Present Infinitive, Perfect Indicative Active, and Supine.   I can see how this relates to English, but I've never heard our words organized in this way. Is it used in teaching the language?   I'm sorry, I'm not familiar with the term 'Venetian Blonde.' This may because Venice is on the other side of the world from Australia.    Can you imagine the world before that song? CHAOS.    Aussies unite. Our chicks are by far the best.   Which is my excuse for why I still miss her.    Gingers are orange.    Yeah the PM gives them all a bad name   ... the pub?    Running their fingers through my ginger beard?   As someone who is familiar with Principal Parts in other languages but not English, can you please explain how they function in this language? I am fascinated. I didn't know we had them.    Yeah, this thread was not a good move.    I waltz over and talk to girls all the time, and they do think it's weird. They think I'm eccentric as hell. Which is probably true.   But they also think I'm fun, outgoing, and confident - which equals attractive.    We are making some progress.   I said a bang, bang, bangity bang, I said a bang bang bangity bang.    I can only assume this is what they did.   Getting called gay when you're clearly not is a compliment? ... this changes everything.    To be fair, Romans were always in sex mode.   One of the duties of the Censors (an elected position) was to prevent celibacy. Yes, conservative Christians and Texan sexual educators, you heard that right. PREVENT.    I would like to point out that not all guys find confidence attractive. It doesn't change a single thing for me, and I would almost prefer a quiet shy girl (albeit one who is still attractive) to an overtly confident girl.    Yes, bikinis are major factor. But the whole salty hair, warm   tanned skin, and general fun atmosphere of the beach makes it a particularly sexy place.    Here's the secret: you actually look really sexy at the beach, just in a totally different way.   	67
 ill be your friend    thank you for the advice and support. i do want to be with him for as long as possible in my life because i love him loads. he supports my problems as i take antidepressants as well but I've never had a decrease in libido. i will talk to him about a sex therapist. we can think about exploring new things to do. i do get quite upset when he can't make me orgasm but that is rare. i give him direction in what i like but i think the problem is also that he hasn't tried anything in terms of sexual experience and experiments. i have in the past done sex acts outside of the bedroom and in the public but he hasn't so that is something we can do together. maybe get a new sex toy purchase.     that is the dose that works for him but not sexually. i think he's going to try and lower it and take something else as well so he doesn't feel as bad    are you being sarcastic?    i have talked to him about it. I've told him various times recently and in the past I'm thinking about leaving him. i told him yesterday i was thinking about cheating on him. it made him cry.    i know how you feel. i am angry all the time. everything annoys me. my body aches. i get fatigued.   keep venting. keep talking.    i dont recall the one that he took at the time    he said he will go on different antidepressants    i havent    i told him it was making me unhappy  	10
 Hope so, I'm a new fan of her work. Who knew she could sing   Cuz she is amazing slash she was in Frozen and her show Veronica Mars got cancelled but Kickstarter brought it back to life into movie form thanks to the fans.    Should I delete it and repost in March?    Sorry! But keep on watching, I just got into the series recently. It's so good!   Yes   **My 5 Questions:**  1. One word to describe the feeling you felt when you got to portray Veronica Mars once again?  2. Veronica Mars is known for causing trouble, what was the worst thing you have ever done when you were in high school?  3. Out of all the mystery twists such as (Aaron Echollos being the murder of Lilly Kane, Cassidy being the school bus killer, Logan's friend being the rapist in Season 3, the TA killing the dean etc) which one shocked you the most? 4. Veronica Mars had so many guest stars that were not well known when the show was airing, but are well known now such as Jessica Chastain, Paul Rudd, Melissa Leo, Jane Lynch, Michael Cera, Aaron Paul just to name a few. Is there a guest star that was featured on the show that you would love to work with again? 5. If you could take one thing from the Veronica Movie set what would it be and why?  **Public Contact Information:** https://twitter.com/IMKristenBell   If you plan on being sexually active use a condom at least. This situation could of been somewhat prevented. You should find a way for her to use the pregnancy test because you both need to discus your options if she is.    I would tell your gf before she finds out    American Hustle was labelled as a comedy as well which it was not.   I don't have friends who like movies as much as I do. But whenever I go see a movie with my friends we discuss the movie for a little bit. The acting, plot and is it worth watching again. You know its a good movie if you can't stop talking about it with your friends I also search on IMDB because my hearing isn't so great I want to know the characters names and more about the film if I really enjoy it   V for Vendetta is one of my favourite movies. It's dark and is full of mysteries. I think it's a great movie much different than the other movies listed. Superhero movies are mostly for entertainment, but if you have the right writers and the right cast and director like Nolan for the Dark Knight Trilogly then you're set.   Maybe get her a stuff animal that says feel better sounds corny but every girl likes a stuff animal    I saw Her a few weeks ago and I really liked it. I thought the storyline was a unique love story that we haven't seen before. Congrats on the Golden Globe win, what was the hardest scene to shoot?   I only needed to read the header to know that your SO is not good, I would get out of the relationship as quick as you can.

Cate Blanchett was out of this world. It was so good, I highly recommended it. What's your view on Blue Jasmine and what other Woody Allen movie should I see?   This guy is a douche.    It sucked what happened, but you got him back really good. But I hope your okay   At the end of the day it's up to you, but I say be a friend or keep your distance because that is a huge gap and its very noticeable when the girl is still in high school and where you are at the age where people have gradauted post-secondary school already.   I would talk to the police and I would tell your parents. This ''friend of yours'' looks like a ticking time bomb.    I know what you are going through. I've been hearing impaired all my life, I have been wearing hearing aids since I was 3 years old and I'm 20. Don't let your hearing disability define who you are. It sucks not being able to hear everything, I had friends tell me never never mind after I told them to repeat it but I told them please stop saying that. I just ask them to repeat it, if the laughing continues be straight up honest with them how you feel they are your friends, you are young and so are you friends, they don't realize what your going to and your probably their first friend with a hearing disability. You should tell them how you feel. And ignore those girls who called you ugly, its not worth your time    I don't know if you have mentioned it, but what was the cause of death?   I'm 20, never been in a relationship. Been on a few dates but never went anywhere. Had my first kiss a week before my 19 bday. It sucks trust me, but just wait you never know what will come your way   I have not been diagnosed with anything, but if this feeling continues I am going to go to the doctor. I've been really down on myself and the only thing that kind of cheers my mood is watching movies/tv shows. Anyways, I'm 20 years old, I got a friends mutual friends etc but I only tell like a few what is actually going on in my life. My dad cancer gotten worse. 3 years ago, it was very hard on me emotionally and I gained a lot of weight. My dad had a treatment where he was able to not loose weight or any hair which was really good because he continued on his life like nothing ever happened and he looked healthy. But about a month, the cancer spread liver, hip and spine and the doctors think the treatment will shrink the cancer but it crushed me in a million pieces. My sister got engaged and I'm just not looking forward to it because a little part of me is scared my dad won't make it.  I'm not as happy as I was before, I was the friend that cheered other people up but not anymore. Also one of my good friends was diagonsed with depression and has cut himself so I think that also made it harder for me as well. Plus there is this girl who I used to be friends with but I distanced myself because she has no filter and some of the things she says it's actually hurtful and she's kind of a bully but not intentionally. She also gets mad at the littest things, she was very mad that I didn't sleep over and made a whole big deal about it. It's hard to smile when at home and look at your life and it is not perfect   Dont give up, lol i hope   It really depends on the individual and when they think its right to loose it. If the oppournity comes if its a short-term boyfriend sure and a fling maybe. It all depends on the situation lol, i hope so! LOL we'll see    My best friend is gay and I hate it when people say ''ugh thats so gay''. Now there are people that use the word ''gay'' as a negative thing, where it is the opposite. There is nothing wrong with being gay, it's a whole other world that you should go into. You should not be ashamed of who you are. You are so brave to come out to your parents, I went to the pride parade to support my best friend, seeing him smile made me so happy its a community that he knows he for sure belongs in and he doesn't have to be scared of who he is. You shouldn't either, your parents will come around. You should join LGBT group to meet new friends. You are not a disappointment    My friend she lost it when she was 16 with her first boyfriend and she wished she waited because when she looks back she wished she lost it with her first real relationship and make it mean something. When your young you don't appericate it as much but it depends on the person. But when you play games or have discussions with friends, like who was your first time saying you lost it over a one night stand could make you regret it because it didn't mean anything to either person, but that first time will always be remebered as a one night stand    I'm 20 years old and I haven't lost virginity yet. 19 is a good age, many people have told me they regret loosing it at a younger age. I'm waiting for my first boyfriend, its a lot longer than I anticipated but I want my first to mean something than just a one night stand that means nothing. I don't think you will loose your boyfriend.   Not in order but here is my list 1. Veep 2. House of Cards 3. Scandal 4. Brookyln Nine Nine   By the grace of god listen to it    Make sure that she did not sleep with anyone else because there is a slim chance it could not be your baby. You should be supportive and ask what she wants. I think abortion would be the best route to go because its unplanned, you guys are both young, it was a one night stand but its all up to you two.    I think it's great that you were able to find an outlet, maybe explain to your parents in a way where she has to listen and say that you need this to help you. Do you like movies, TV shows, writting poems etc? Maybe there is another outlet you can use? My life is pretty hetic so I watch Movies, TV shows as an outlet to distract myself from the real world   Coming out is not easy. I don't know what it's like, but being able to come out of the closet and not know how people are going to react is very brave. You should be proud that you were able to do that, because unfortunately many are scared and hide their sexuality. Have you ever thought joining a LGBT group where you can meet new people and those that are experiencing what you are? You should not end your life, because if you do then your dad will win. You want to show your dad that you are better by living life to the fullest. You have so much to experience in so little time. Maybe go stay at a friends house?   Don't let it define who you are and make you think less about yourself. Go out there show it off and be yourself. Every one has someone for each other we just got to go ahead and find it.    Thank you, hearing someone else who have been through it helps me a lot. :)   Veep- Hilarious, foul mouth comedy- Julia from Seinfled is in it  House Of Cards- Great dark drama- Kevin Spacey is in it   Easy A, Pitch Perfect, Walk To Remember   	39
 40  More than I thought. And more than I have resources to develop. Lol   Saw your request in game before I saw your message. Hope she helped!   Accepted. I have Lilly up for you.    Thanks!

 I actually find this interesting cause I have also found that (in my limited experience) that most of the discrimination towards me has come from other women.    Yeah my first job while I was still studying was as first level support on an IT helpdesk, and clients would ring up and assume that I was the receptionist and when I explained I wasn't and I was there to help them, sometimes they would still ask to speak to 'one of the boys'. I'd have to tell them that they were busy and ask again how I could help them. The guys were more experienced than me but 95-99% of client requests I was able to fix myself.   Being punched in the throat sucks, but I don't know that I'd like being punched in the boobs/chest either. Are they meant to punch you there?   Yeah that's tough. I had a friend who was in a similar situation as you. Some of the older female teachers were quite unfriendly. What level of teaching will you be doing?   I am a female in IT. I chose this field because I enjoy it, and it turns out I am good at it. I am not concerned about the gender bias because I feel my qualifications and experience speak for themselves, and so far that has been the case (the only time I have been discriminated against it has not affected my career progress). However, I'm relatively inexperienced and I would love to know other people's experiences in similar environments.   I will read, and then if I am feeling energetic still, I will write a list of all the things I have to do the next day, and the thought of that sometimes makes me mentally exhausted and I nod off. Plus if you're like me and think about all your problems, planning out the next day gives you something else to think about besides the problems. I also find that coming on the computer usually makes me stay up longer, so using it right before bed is often not a good idea for me if I'm trying to sleep.    Yes! I hate it when people do that on travelators and moving walkways too. Those things take so goddamn long. There's a shopping center near me and they have one on every level. Drives me crazy going there. It's 5 floors but if I know I'm going to the top level I take the carpark stairs instead.    I would probably call a pest controller. Then you can try to seal up/remove/clear clutter from any places where they are likely to hide. That is pretty hard when they hide in garden beds though I guess, but hopefully they won't go in your house.   Well that is bad timing. Just don't do what this guy did and leave his trousers on the floor between gardening sessions: http://www.news.com.au/couriermail/story/0,23739,23002709-5013016,00.html   More info here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sydney_funnel-web_spider      I was in a hotel in NYC a while back using the net in the narrow hallway cause the hotel signal didn't reach my room. This random creepy guy came past and asked me if I wanted to join the "party" in his room (with one other guy). I didn't use the net in the hallway anymore after that.     We recently had our headlamps replaced in our Toyota 4WD with some crappy ones when they broke. I don't think they were a genuine part, or they were 2nd hand. We drive about a 6-8hr drive (each way) at least 2 times a year in winter to go down south on highways and so we have to drive part of the way at night usually (cause we are slow getting away). The high beam on the old headlamps was really bad - I nearly hit a few dead kangaroos because of this. We got them replaced again with brand new ones after some scary driving experiences and it was HEAPS better - I could see at least 10 times as far. Didn't need HID lights, and I don't know why anyone really would need them. Definitely recommend replacing with the regular lights first before trying annoying HID lights.   I thought that the sound of thunder was the result of giants bowling in the sky on top of the clouds.   Is the $3 for a one way fare? Our tickets just went up today too. I used to pay AU$9.60 or sometihng like that for a return ticket to work on the train from my parents (approx 25km), but now it's AU$10 (USD$8.96/CAD$9.41) return.   Bus isn't much better. When I'm at my city place (approx 5km from work), it costs me AU$2.60 each way on the bus.  I feel so ripped off.    We have trains here (Sydney). Then after 1am or something like that, they have nightride buses for most of the major train lines. Do you have anything like that once the subway stops or do you get stranded in the city/downtown?    I think the gang-rape thing happened once or twice, and it hit newspapers pretty hard. I don't remember it being like a common trend. Most of those guys got decent prison sentences for the really bad rape, but some of them got away pretty lightly.   The beach thing that happened was really disappointing. I definitely think the media fulled that incident, and I think most of the locals disapproved but there are idiots everywhere and sometimes it only takes a few. I definitely think there was a problem there long before this happened, and I think there still is. I honestly don't know what the solution is. Most of the guys are just stupid teenagers/young adults and are showing off to their friends in the most intolerable ways possible.    I live in Sydney too.   I agree about the people being rude. It's amazing how lonely you can feel with so many people around. I live and work in the city, but it is a bit stressful sometimes and I miss the open space that I have at my parents in the suburbs. Even then it's not as nice out there as it used to be, since the bush is now all gone and new housing developments went up when I was a kid. I remember when we used to go to the shopping centre everyone knew each other and we couldn't go through without mum having a million conversations... I used to think grocery shopping took forever... but now I realise we had it good. It's not like that as much anymore.   Sure there are crowds at big events, but then again you don't have to go if you don't like that sort of thing. There are quite a few jerks around that just don't care about anyone else's experience, so you have to learn a great deal of tolerance and not let it get to you, otherwise you can never enjoy yourself. That said, sometimes it's hard to ignore. I went out to dinner one night (kind of late - 11pm), and saw 3 people throw up in the street while we were walking to the restaurant (in the space of one block). I was kind of glad we were too late to get food from for the restaurant. If you are with a group of friends and can ignore it, the atmosphere can be great (as long as you know the best spot to go).   With the immigration, I agree there's a problem there in terms of people actively not wanting to be part of Australian society. Obviously I am glad some people have cultural identity, and can feel like they belong somewhere, but so often I feel like some have no respect for any other race or culture aside from their own, and often do try to intimidate you so they can force some sort of feeble excuse for respect from you. It's not like that everywhere in Sydney, and I think you can have a completely different experience and quality of life if you live in a nicer suburb as you suggested. I think that's like a lot of large cities as well, and because I haven't lived anywhere very long term I don't know enough to say that other places are any better. I'd like to think they would be though.  I used to go surfing a bit when I was younger and nowadays I don't like it so much. I used to go to Cronulla (where the riots happened a few years back) quite regularly. I had some problems myself long before that incident. I don't like city beaches much anymore. Especially after finding 3 syringes in the sand on separate occasions. That all said I will still go surfing and for most of the time (not hot ones cause those are the days that attract the idiots), it is a nice place. Advice tho: wear thongs   don't build sandcastles far away from the water's edge cause the rubbish tractors don't clear the edges of the beach very well.    I used to love Sydney because I thought it had everything - beautiful harbour, beautiful beaches, convenient local area shopping centers, good restaurants, good nightlife, multiculturalism, etc. - but as I get older and see more of Sydney I think sometimes I feel that the things I dislike about it are outweighing the benefits as well.   I have really mixed feelings about this place, and so often I do feel like I hate it. I definitely want to get out and experience other places as well.      My biggest fear is making a mess of my life, and screwing it up so bad I will lose everyone and everything that matters, and will eventually die alone with my own self pity and regret.   Shakespeare had a lot of themes in his plays, like greed, guilt, temptation, love, hate, revenge, forgiveness, violence, jealousy, etc. Maybe if you can pick a theme that interests you it might be a starting point for some ideas. (Oh, and I'm not saying to do a shakespeare style play or anything like that... just to get some ideas).  Otherwise what would interest your audience? Or you? What's something you've learned in life, or a interesting event that has happened? Anything interesting you've learned from someone else?    We were out watching fireworks a few years back and after they end the city goes crazy with drunks everywhere. I saw this girl and guy fighting, after which the guy punches her in the face. Probably cause she is a bit drunk she falls straight from her feet onto her head on the curb, with no arm out or anything. I hear this loud cracking noise as her head hits the curb, and the guy walks off, leaving her with her friend. The girl was probably okay because I heard her screaming and crying after she fell. I saw some police nearby who are stopping people from going on the bridge. I walked up to the first one and explained what happened a few meters away and asked if he could call an ambulance. He explained he was too busy watching the bridge. I walked over to the other cop working with him who was clearly the more senior cop and he called an ambulance. Not blaming the cop they were probably overwhelmed but that was a weird thing to see.   I think this time she should get all the cash. Maybe next time half :P   Explosive Diarrhea   I have this (Lite White): http://www.dairyfarmers.com.au/df/ourproductsandrecipes/milk/dairyfarmersbrlitewhite  I used to hate skim milk but I am lactose intolerant so I get sick drinking full cream milk now. But I can drink this and it tastes good.   I should get a job advertising this milk.   When I was a kid, my sister and I thought it was a great idea to eat hot two minute noodles (including the boiling water) on the trampoline. It was decided I would get up there first, she'd pass me the bowl (which I held on my lap), and then she'd get up afterwards, and we could enjoy noodles and trampolining concurrently.  I burnt my whole right upper leg and spent a few weeks sitting down and having this white cooling cream applied to the burns.    The OP annoyed the Twatty guy, who got up in anger and asked the rhetorical question "Do you know who my father is?" as if implying he is a man of great influence or importance, and someone not to be messed with.   By interpreting the question non-rhetorically you could assume the person really doesn't know who their father is. The OP uses this to offend the Twatty guy by responding with "No. Have you tried asking your mother?" and implying that the mother either slept around or was no longer involved with the father of the Twatty guy.  I'm not great with explanations but hopefully that clears it up.   You're welcome! Happy New Year!   Looks like you're there! :P   Most of my debt is from FEE-HELP/HECS.   The only big accident I've had was reversing into my sister's car from the garage cause the outside light was broken and my car is a bit chunky at the back and I didn't look properly.   Then after this, instead of getting out to check the damage, I drove forward again to separate the cars and pulled out some pipe full of oil that my tow bar had got stuck under. The car was spurting oil all over the driveway. Oh god I'm stupid.   Read the news, learn about other ways of life, meet non-US born people and learn some of the other countries' history.  I think learning history will make you appreciate other cultures more, and the things they have done in the past and present.  Also I liked doing charity volunteering a little while ago just on a few occasions, but for the few days I did it, the whole time I was thinking about how little people in these other places had and how much capacity we have to give.    Thanks. That's both disgusting and informative.   Wouldn't wearing socks mean your feet don't dry properly though and you would make the bacteria growth worse? I mean even if I dry my feet with a towel I like to let them air a little bit before putting on socks or shoes.   My cousin is like this. He wouldn't eat anything besides meat and rice. My dad used to always ask him if he was constipated.   Same with me. I couldn't have any type of cheese unless it was melted on toast or pizza. Then I was introduced slowly to all different types of cheese and I realised that there are a billion types of cheese besides tasty cheese and those cheese sticks which I still think are gross!   I still don't like all cheese but sometimes cheese just makes a sandwich or a meal! :)   Did you get an invite? I have a friend who's been on reddit for 2 months but won't be able to join cause apparently it's too short :(  It sucks cause he's the one who introduced me to reddit, he just didn't sign up for ages!   I sent you something small to say thanks! You started something awesome on reddit! :)   They have a minimum length of membership too. :(   I usually find a comment that says the same thing I would say and upvote it - otherwise you would have 1000 comments that are exactly the same, and that's kind of boring to read.   This is awesome. Thank you! Merry Christmas :)   I just found this. Thanks!   State: New South Wales   Cronulla. They upgraded the STP back in 1998 - haven't had any more ear infections since luckily. It used to be the dirtiest beach water in Sydney before that.   One of my friends mum's also used to surf and now has permanent ear problems from getting ear infections, so I'm glad nothing permanent has happened to me.    SMH: [http://www.smh.com.au/national/skydiver-dead-after-13th-jump-20091128-jxz5.html](http://www.smh.com.au/national/skydiver-dead-after-13th-jump-20091128-jxz5.html)  I think a couple of people die every year out there. I would freak out at that particular place cause they get dropped out right near the highway. I've seen some guys get pretty close to the traffic.   Yeah I used to get quite a few ear infections before they upgraded the sewage treatment plant.    I've swum there! I'm still more scared of [box jellyfish](http://www.barrierreefaustralia.com/the-great-barrier-reef/jellyfish.htm) than great whites, because with box jellyfish:     You have virtually no chance of surviving the venomous sting, unless treated immediately. The pain is so excruciating and overwhelming that you would most likely go into shock and drown before reaching the shore.      I think some of it is to do with attitude towards a problem.   The bigger the learning curve the more fear you have I.e. the bigger the perceived 'hardness'.  Sometimes learning something new can be really hard, because you might not have all the necessary background knowledge or know the terminology, and so at first you don't take it in. If you persist with it long enough and get past this point, the result can be really rewarding.   I sometimes think maybe people have found something hard, began working on it but not persisted long enough to get the reward. So the next time they see a problem, they have an even bigger mental barrier because they didn't feel the satisfaction from last time. If this is a problem, at least for me I found the best thing to do is break it down into parts and then each time you understand a part you will feel a bit better - trying to understand a huge problem in one go can be really demotivating.   I went out with a guy that smoked and I didn't let him do it around me. I didn't break up with him, but I still didn't like it.  I don't consider objecting to someone else smoking as being controlling - more that you care about that person and don't want them to get addicted, waste money or damage their health. In reality, I could never stop him from smoking - he could just do it behind my back - but I did tell him how I felt about it and in the end he made his own decision to quit.   * Like this magnet on metal we joining together, So make sure you're there when we make it forever.  * You might remember this date in your head, But to be safe here's a magnet with the date we will wed.  * We'd love you to be attending our wedding,  So here's a magnet so you don't go forgetting.  * Put this magnet somewhere you'll remember, The date we'll make our vows together!  * This invitation has a magnetic field, To make sure you're there when we seal the deal!   Don't you get cockroaches or insects? I live in a unit - if I left dishes out the cockroaches would come from all the other units and infest my place.    I don't expect everyone to smile back or that they are necessarily depressed cause they don't smile back, but I like it when they do.    It's for the buses. You buy ten trips in advance on Sydney Buses, and put it into the green ticket reader box when you get on a bus and it reads the magnetic strip and prints the trip on the back (bus number and time). They've been around for a while but you didn't have to use them before. See the [Transport Infoline Website](http://www.131500.com.au/faresandpasses/sydneybuses_travelten.asp). Looks like [this](http://profile.ak.fbcdn.net/object3/1528/118/n91760107804_3407.jpg) - non-concession adult has white instead of yellow background.   Everyone poops! If you didn't paint her walls with your poop I don't see any problem. Besides that, I guess it's her fault if her walls are so thin she can hear.   I can think of a few things you can do though:  A) You can try turning on the tv or radio beforehand if possible. Then just let it rip. Flush it and act like nothing happened. Avoid going near the bathroom for a while.  B) Get her to go to the toilet first and then act subtly disgusted and pretend like it sounded/smelt horrible. Then she'll be so worried about how horrible her poo was she won't even care if yours sounds/smells bad.   C) Show her how awesome the poo you just did was.   Friendliness. Where I live people can be pretty unfriendly, and I hardly see people smile... it's kind of sad. I try to smile at people (whenever it's not weird) and I really like it when people smile back. :)    It's kind of hard to notice things when you live here cause it happens so slowly when you're here. Here's a few things I can think of off the top of my head:  * The Harbour Bridge and some other places are now cashless. You need one of those e-tags to cross it now. I hate toll roads.   * Buses around the city require you to have a travel 10 to get on/off buses during peak periods (I think it's 7am-7pm but I can't remember), so you can't pay cash to travel. I think this is probably a good thing but most people who travel regularly get Travel 10s anyway cause they're cheaper.   * There was some stuff going on with Bikie Gangs which is still happening. They [bludgeoned some guy to death at the domestic terminal](http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2009/03/30/2530292.htm).   * The international airport (departure) was getting upgraded and had barely any food in the food court there. It sucks to hang around at before a flight. [Due to finish 2010](http://www.sydneyairport.com.au/sacl/International-Terminal---Expansion-and-Upgrade.html).  * If you're already in Australia this won't make any difference but here anyway -  [Utility costs have gone up](http://www.switzer.com.au/latest-news/news-stories/record-lift-in-utility-charges-proves-inflation-bogy/):  Utility charges rose by a record (37 years) 10.2 per cent in the September quarter. Utility charges rose by 13.4 per cent over the year  the biggest increase in 26 years.  * Pitt Street mall is going through an upgrade. Not a very pretty sight at the moment (not that it really was before).  * RTA penalties for speeding have changed a few times now. P platers have zero alcohol limit now, and there are some new anti-hoon laws.   * More and more school zones have flashing lights now when it is 40km/h  * God damn birds! I used to open my balcony window in the mornings, but the miner birds are trying to nest, and a pair flew into my unit (I'm on the 4th floor), as did a pigeon. Pigeons at least are pretty predictable and so that one just kept flying at the window trying to get out. I caught it with a towel and let it out. Then a few days later some miner birds flew in and were scared shitless of me, so shitless, they shat all over my unit. I had bird poop everywhere. This, along with the time a turkey tried to steal my lunch, now mean I only like some birds.     I hate cyclists mainly because of their outfits. How streamlined do they really need to be? I want to hold my food down.   Thanks for this article. I heard so many different opinions and didn't really understand what was going on. It makes more sense now.    From the Telegraph: [link](http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/grant-edward-brown-refused-bail-after-being-charged-with-unprovoked-attack-on-circular-quay-to-manly-ferry/story-e6freuy9-1225798655514)  **Grant Edward Brown refused bail after being charged with unprovoked attack on Circular Quay to Manly ferry**  *November 17, 2009 3:31PM*   A PERSONAL trainer accused of striking a 70-year-old man in the head in a bout of unprovoked violence on a Manly ferry has been refused bail for the protection of the community.  Grant Edward Brown, 31, was charged with recklessly wounding after the incident on the Queenscliff ferry shortly after it left Circular Quay at 6pm yesterday.  Police allege Brown, visiting from Tasmania, struck John Edward Lane once to the face, causing him to fall heavily and his head hit the ground.  Documents tendered to Central Local Court this afternoon have revealed Brown was allegedly talking loudly and aggressively on a telephone shortly before the incident.  To the unknown person on the phone, Brown allegedly said: If someone on this ferry gets their head punched in, it will be on you.  A short time later, he was allegedly acting aggressively, kicking walls and bins before a companion of Mr Lanes then alleged approached him and told him to calm down.  He refused, threatening to bash your head in.  When Mr Lane then interjected urging him to relax as well, he was told: Step away, I swear Im going to punch your f***ing head in.  He then allegedly struck Mr Lane with a closed fist, causing the victim to fall to the ground and strike his head on the deck.  Witnesses have told police of seeing a large amount of blood and then hearing the accused man become hysterical: Someone help him, someone help him.  Magistrate Allan Moore refused the Tasmanian bail, saying he was not satisfied that the community would be safe if he was released to bail.  The case will be re-mentioned on Friday.    Sure they have good facilities but how come it still looks so grey and work-like :(   I'm not sure if you mean modern day or older times, but for people who really travelled long distances, look up the older explorers from before the 19th century.   You can start with this [list of explorers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_explorers) on Wikipedia.   Do you live under a bridge?   This is good but more relevant for essays and reports I think.   Those are pretty good. I like the [single fork](http://www.moolf.com/images/stories/Interesting/Beautiful-Macro-Photography-by-Bonali-Giuseppe/Beautiful-Macro-Photography-by-Bonali-Giuseppe-9.jpg), [can lid](http://www.moolf.com/images/stories/Interesting/Beautiful-Macro-Photography-by-Bonali-Giuseppe/Beautiful-Macro-Photography-by-Bonali-Giuseppe-14.jpg) and the [bee](http://www.moolf.com/images/stories/Interesting/Beautiful-Macro-Photography-by-Bonali-Giuseppe/Beautiful-Macro-Photography-by-Bonali-Giuseppe-33.jpg).    Yeah that's the difference. Ours get a decent wage so we don't have to tip.   I also only recently learned you have to tip in Canada too. I thought they had the same system as Australia.     Does it vary from place to place or is it the same all over the US?     Try to die in a month when the demand for funeral services is low.  Perhaps the summer or a temperate spring.  Your loved ones may get a good deal that way.  Okay I'll do my best.   Some of the first shots at night are a bit too dark to really see anything, or from different angles. The later ones are good. It's interesting to see most things haven't changed that much though.   Did it taste like Fanta?    Can someone explain to me how tipping works?  I gathered this:  Most places: 15%  Small towns: 10%  NYC: 20%  And then is it 5% either side of that if you liked or didn't like the service?    My uncle went on the Queen Elizabeth II cruise ship and it was all you can eat all the time. He said there were some americans that had the following meals (each with a full buffet style serving):  * Breakfast  * Morning Tea  * Brunch  * Lunch  * Afternoon Tea  * Dinner (Entres included)  * Dessert  * Supper  When they docked they didn't have enough time to unload all the human waste - there were trucks lining up to take away the sewerage, so the ship left with still plenty of gunk on board.  He is not young (75+) and he said they were the fattest people he'd seen in his life.   Yeah :(   It took me ages to notice too cause I always stare out the window. I only noticed once we went into the tunnels and I saw his reflection in the window.    I get the train and the bus, and I don't like public transport because:  * It's expensive  * It's slow  * If the buses fills up they don't stop to let passengers on. So you can't rely on it to get you somewhere on time. The next bus might not be for another 20 minutes.  * Has sick people spreading their illnesses  * It's uncomfortable and crowded - sometimes I can't get a seat and have to stand up, and sometimes I get squished by someone, I also do my groceries and have to carry them on my lap because someone decided to sit next to me with all my groceries instead of one of the other free chairs.  * It's dirty - people always leave their rubbish on the train, especially the later ones after peak hour.  * Bad experiences - a guy once jerked off next to me on the train.   I still catch public transport only because  * It's still slightly cheaper than driving  * The train can be faster than driving in peak hour  I sometimes stay near work and just walk to work, but it is 4km over fairly hilly terrain and can be a little tiring after a long work day, and not that safe.   The rule only applies to diagraphs ([link](http://alt-usage-english.org/I_before_E.html)).   Or nutella and banana!   Fair enough, I guess I found it hard to know what to buy. I half expected that multi grain bread would be just savoury type bread with grains in it, but it was heaps sweet. We don't have any bread that is sweet in the supermarket. Maybe if I went with an American they could have shown me what to buy.    I just went to a regular supermarket.    Don't worry about that! Just go for it! Have a little faith in yourself. The more obstacles you overcome the more confidence you'll gain, and things will hopefully become easier for you the more experience and knowledge you get.   I have always had pretty clear skin, but acne never bothered me on anyone else.  My ex had a lot of acne. When he got older it just went away naturally. He got a face peel done and it looked like he'd never had acne in the first place.    oink oink   I think what's gross is how pretty much all American food has a high concentration of sugar. For example, bread, cheese, breakfast cereals. The cheese from a regular supermarket there actually tastes like McDonalds cheese, and the bread is like lolly bread. Where do Americans go to buy savoury things, or things with no sugar?    I love avocados!   I think the US has the largest meal sizes for McDonalds. It's bad enough in the small sizes but the big sizes are just sickening (yet somehow still tasty).   Their small meal size is equivalent to our medium, and their medium is our large. I'm not sure if a US-sized large McDonalds meal even exists here.   Does anyone actually finish their plate there? I've been to the US a couple of times now and I never finished a meal. They were like family sized servings.   I don't think your host family is representative of the rest of Australia. We eat pumpkin plenty. But we just don't normally make it into a pie.   Sorry, I have no idea. I'm not in that area. I'd need the name of the article to find it. Can you remember the author or journal name? Maybe try a search there. If you can find an link online that's even better.   Did you have to pee when you woke up?   Bleach is the way to go. Just make sure the room is well ventilated.  Also [DON'T mix bleach and ammonia](http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/classic/A795611). It produces toxic gases. Ammonia is contained in some household cleaners ([link](http://www.npi.gov.au/database/substance-info/profiles/pubs/ammonia.pdf)).      This is all John West's fault. We don't have to have the best!! All tuna is excellent.   Take lunch breaks. For my first job I didn't. You need that - even 15 minutes - to just have a break and calm/de-stress yourself.   while putting on makeup and adjusting the radio   Good Irish Yodel Farts?   Go in for the kiss and when she closes her eyes to wait for it, slap on some wax and let it rip! She'll thank you later.   Bad timing   A table was standing next to two stacked chairs. A gnome wearing a pointy hat was learning how to dance. He took three steps right and knocked the chairs off their neat stack.   Also good if you're paying for part of a meal shared with friends. Then you can just round up the amount to the nearest whole note you have.  	95
 I used to  but the problem is no lane presence and/or how will you get past all the cc   it now comes to the point whether you can reliably apply the cc, correctly  for example, tf's stun card takes time   it's possible but then it comes to the question to whether you can stun kat reliably   the support role cannot just be filled by anyone  all adcs are viable, but not every adc can fit into just any team comp  some people try to be unconventional with adc lulu, adc ahri, adc kennen, etc   oops   not all of them are viable, so the number is actually lower  compared to adc which have 18 it makes sense at least 15 should be enough   it's a root, not hard CC...  even then, it does not stop kat ult...   simply put: there are not enough champions to fill in the role and it gets tedious trying to rotate among them (I counted 14 using my definition) when there isn't a lot to begin with. you can only play leona so much before you go crazy  the way I define support is: can you stop kat ult? (reliably, such as in the case of morgana, is a different story though) this is what honestly is keeping the support role from being able to fit in other champions. if we just nerfed (preferably delete) katarina then this will be better.  1) traditional supports: -alistar -blitzcrank -braum -janna -leona -lulu -nami -sona -soraka -thresh -taric total: 11  2) mages that went support -annie -fiddlesticks -morgana -vel'koz -zyra total: 5  3) situational supports or those that fail to meet the criteria (usually no hard cc) -lux -kayle -karma -zilean -all other mages   Saying her spear does less damage is not exactly fixing. The spear can still do a lot: if it used to be 90% of health it's 70% of health, so that reduction is not meaningful, plus she can just go in and execute. She's strong range and melee.  These are not counterplay: Dodge the spear, Cc her, She has to put herself at 'risk'(what about a champion like talon?)  	9
