 Hey guys. I think we can ask agree we're ready for winter already. With that being said I need new boots. To be honest I've done zero research so any opinions would be fine. I'm looking for a durable but comfortable style. If you like your boots par tell me what they are. Thanks so much fellas   Hey Nathan I am a huge fan and I've seen every episode.   I just want to ask about the girl Rachel. Is that actually how she is or do you exaggerate the awkwardness for the camera? Also when you get her for more than one segment (The Hunk and Quiznos) doesn't she start to ham it up a little too?  Thanks for doing this. Favorite show on television    I always pictured it almost without a face, and that's what made the face so memorable.    Hey G!  I saw you at Firefly and you were definitely my favorite show. Thanks so much for coming!  Question I guess would be who's your favorite rapper to collaborate with?   What's your favorite song off of Music is Better than Words?      I'm new to tagpro and I don't know if I need to download anything additional. However I've been waiting for an hour on the screen that says "looking for a game". HELP   I've been trying to connect for a game for 20 minutes now. I've tried 2 servers both for 10 minutes and I can't connect. Can anybody help me?   The beginning of all the Assassin's Creed games. Before you can free roam and kill people and just have fun. You have to do all of these pointless missions   I don't know who you are, but...yeah you got it right.  	10
 :)  Thanks.  A current mini marathon of How I Met Your Mother is also helping me out.  I just wish I had a time machine to halt everything and think things through!  That, or enough money to drop everything and travel down under, where I've always wanted to   I get that.  This time last year when I was drowning in coursework, etc, I never really hated it or felt like leaving it forever.   It's hard that most of my friends in the program are not only going to medical school (many have already been accepted, ridiculous) but are *supposedly* just loving their projects and feel like they are in the right place.  I am definitely the outcast of the group. But thank you :)  Any advice from anyone is truly appreciated.  	2
 What if you tank better drunk?   Oh just wait!   Oh God, this scene. D:   By higher level I meant 50 on. Should've clarified: I'm aware Shield Oath and Shield Lob both help increase hate, but I've never been particularly good at keeping hate 100% of the time (which I know is impossible, but I need to humor the idealist in me). Flash, as was previously mentioned, only does so much, but I really needed I think to utilize rotating through targets more. Usually I just spam Flash/Halone combo/circle of scorn -- then provoke on any enemies that aren't in range of Flash, but it doesn't always work, and whenever I'm not Tanking I always notice those tanks who more or less keep Aggro 95% of the time.    Hey guys,   I was curious on how to maintain aggro most of the time in the higher level dungeons. Lately I've been having issues maintaining it, and spamming Flash isn't necessarily the best strategy. Would it be best to alternate between targets that you are attacking in order to maintain aggro? I've never really been completely sure of how exactly to go about this. Nobody I've queued with has really complained about it, but I've been wanting to learn to maintain it firmly.   I've noticed from experimenting and using Fracture as a PLD that it's really not all that useful, so I am scrapping that. All of the comments here are quite helpful, so thanks!    Whoops, you're right! For some reason I was envisioning an A minor7 b5 in my head and didn't think in terms of a Major key.    Hey guys, so I have an i90 PLD and am in the process of leveling my MRD for cross-class abilities. Which ones should I go for? Are there any other abilities that would be beneficial to the PLD job?  	8
 take a few hundred then turn it in.   Female? Khakis, black pants, or black jeans. Nice dress shirt or tank with a cardigan. Be friendly and treat it like a conversation with a friend. You'll be find.   Intelligence - 8.5  physical - 6  sexual abilities - 9   Take her to grab a coffee or ice cream before the party. Best of both worlds.   Yes, of course ask her! If you like her enough to post this, then do it! Don't text her. At least call her. Or text her to plan a skype date then ask her. If you want to spend a little bit, send flowers with a note. Or, just make the drive. 90 minutes isn't too far.  Just do it!   I can't answer this for you because it's all your feelings. forget about the girl moving or her sleeping around. Now which would you prefer? You said you're in love with number 1, remember?  Go with your gut.   Yes. Funny in a sarcastic, friendly or witty manner is very appealing. The kind of funny where you make fun of other people, are obnoxious, or make poop jokes is not attractive and quite annoying.  BUT, be yourself. Don't try and become a comedian, just be you.   Yes, they can most likely refer you to some type of counseling.  Just tell them how you feel and all your symptoms. What helps is to write a list beforehand so they know everything. That's pretty much it. I recommend a psychiatrist over your regular family doctor though. If you're still in college, they usually have free counseling and a psychiatrist on hand for your convenience.    A form of coping. Plus plenty of meterial. You look at the world differently because your brain lists things of importance differently. Making people laugh for me is one of the things that gives me self confidence and being sarcastic and witty is a way to stay sane for me, if that makes any sense.    He looks just like beckham to me.    No   A really bad paper cut wound.   Riding gave me sore thighs for like 3 days. Once I woke up with pretty bad scratches on my legs in all different areas, I think from a bunk bed. And of course bruised knees, which is a horrible cliche.  Man I miss rowdy sex.    I think this is the winner here.   French fries and mayo   All mom and pop, nonchains. I don't understand why people go unless you're out of town and unsure.    Interesting question. I'd have to do some calculations and see what tools were provided for me. I think $400,000 may be acceptable for the client and myself.   If she is actively trying to work on herself and an adult, then no, I'd let her try therapy and be just there for her. Talk to her first, say you want to say something to her parents and think she needs more help BEFORE making a big move.   Um, probably just a guy that can be my friend. When you're a friend, you give a fuck about them and can also shoot the shit with.   ask your neighbor. if he hassles, tell him you'll buy him mcdonalds. Or craigslist. Or call the local news for help. Or a radio station. Or yik yak. Or be like the girl from that one college that said she would carry around a mattress until her rapist got expelled, which then led to multiple people carrying the mattress FOR her for weeks.   you sound like a fun friend. Your girlfriend as well. Keep it up.   was he gay?   I thought bets like this were just stupid jokes and nobody followed through, mostly because we all forget about it 5 minutes later. It sounds like you wanted it...  But seriously, I don't really find this a big deal. Is that bad?   I'd say keep a job and get a degree in something first (if you don't already). In the meantime, expand your horizons. Say "yes" more to people inviting you to do new things, take up a hobby, read something you find interesting. Then make a list of things you like to do. Not like "taking people's temperatures" but more of your character traits and what eases you/excites you. Discover who you are by what gives you internal pleasure or drive.   Maybe you should talk with someone to get past that. There's one thing to be naturally introverted, but this seems like something that's holding you back from greater things. I'm really sorry this happened to you.   Sex and killing people... but not in that order.   vegetables... what's really great is homemade veggie chips or fries. Basically just roast stuff in chip or dry form and pretend it's a junk food. carrots, zucchini, kale, turnips, etc   relaxing or not multitasking. I always need something to do, to work towards. huge perfectionist.  other than that, I cannot stand dishes in the sink!!   as fast as my heartbeat.   bossypants - tina fey   Eat fast food you have back home. Rob a bank, rape, stone a woman. Insult our military. Use racial slurs.  But other than that you can do anything. If you're asking what major sites are overrated and not worth your time, start a new thread.   One I love is I Wanna Get Better by Bleachers.  Gym class Heroes/Travie McCoy have a few but I can't remember the titles now.  Otherwise by Macklemore   Same At my schools. If your parent didn't call in the morning, you got a phone call home by an administrator, or if it was high school, you got a recorded message saying you weren't in.    I always just stayed home. once I went to a hockey game though. I wish I would have forged more early dismissal/late arrival notes though. I went to school far too often.  College is another story.    Until you get addicted.    I was going to post something similar but I didn't want reddit to judge me because I judge a guy by their looks.   Depends how it's done and by whom. If he doesn't cat call or say "yo mami", I think, "wow! I'm not that ugly! At least one part of me is nice!"  Other than that I just get uncomfortable and scared.    Don't be late or shy. Know when you can work.  I was like 10 minutes late and didn't plan my other jobs schedule to tell them my availability and fucked it up.   Oh, and dress nice.   Shameless! Best show on tv.    Were you at a party or with other friends? If so, get them to hang out again and make sure she comes. From there, get her number. If it works well at the get together, ask her there if shed like to get coffee or a drink.   Pretend Facebook never existed and it's 1985.   Yes of course. Did you think it's like the CEO or manager of something? If so, wear a pants suit. Other than that, wear a cardigan, nice shirt, and slacks. That works for most jobs.   Panty selling probably   Not surprised one bit.   Probably either be engaged or married. With a career. Would be pretty down on myself if I was without either. Definitely moved out as well.  As far as activities, I'd like to get my car inspected by myself. Travel oversees again. Volunteer in a different country. Rock climb!   No you can never please everyone, whether it be the countries people or other countries. However, like the other comment, Switzerland is inching there and I think Amsterdam is doing well.   Just like every day- wake up and say "today im going to be great!" Take a hot shower and grab a coffee and remain optimistic. Find something to look forward to! Like next weekend of an amazing dinner you're going to cook when you get out of work. It may sound cliche but you if you tell yourself you're going to have a good day, you'll start believing it.   i looked in here before watching but idc, she's dead?!/ yess!   I would have thought he meant standards. Like it's easier than you think.    tell me about the teachers lounge and any gossip about the teachers.   This is absolutely insane to me. I know people in NY that have their masters in teaching and can barely get a subbing job.    what site posts the quickest? I need to get to bed early tonight but want to watch ASAP.   Yeah I always need to be working. Just got 2 jobs for 60 hours a week. Because the job schedule, I still have afternoons free and I'm off all day Tuesday and I hate it. It's actually a problem, I always feel bored or lazy.   I think I had a mental breakdown in my lifetime, yes. But tonight (slightly dramatic) I have not. Hanging in there    I'm hoping my new jobs get me to slim down because I'm phat   Woohoo! I miss those early days, like my first 5 times having sex. Lots of nostalgia for that point in my life. I had sex last week and it felt like a daily routine, like brushing my teeth. *sigh*  Watching the walking dead tonight?   How old are you?  How many girls have you had vanginal sex with?  How do you handle sex? Like, do you just assume to not thrust so far in or what? I don't have a penis so that may be a stupid question.  Oh, and where do you live? I'm interested....   Damn...   I love Belgium! I want to go back right now.    What's the word, baby bird?   Literally everything.   I don't buy cheap canned foods there. I make sure if I buy canned food, I try and find low or no added sodium and/or sugar, possibly organic, brands which aren't normally carried by these stores.  I'll buy store brand names for pretty much anything. Mom says stick to popular brands for cleaning supplies.    Working in food service. Cooking, walking, serving, carrying stock. Plus you get paid!   Hahaha I've gotten similar.   Cholesterol and eggs. Fat being "bad."   I personally believe in it. I know stuff is probably staged and cut to look and sound different but overall, I feel she is legit.  I might be in the minority here.  	65
 come on man its only a bit of fun   cue all the opinions that are not controversial at all    i know what you mean mate. players getting sent off and costing you the cup or something then they get mad. its absolutely ridiculous    i'm just gonna be blunt if you haven't been spotted by now theres a very slim chance you will make it. keep putting in good performance's for your club and hope to get noticed by a scout.

 I enter this often, and sometimes even become completely unresponsive and my partner often stops in a panic and checks I'm still ok to continue. We have safe words, and hand gestures for when I am gagged, but never feel I have to use them...but it's always best to have one just in case.    Well, best of luck...maybe steer clear of those conversations or just sit in and see others reactions and responses.   I have been doing this for a while, and started on FL. I have only bean to one munch, and realised it was not for me. I find people at munches to be a little too sociable than me and it did make me nervous. I stuck to meeting people one on one, because it was less overwhelming and I didn't feel under huge pressure. I'd say to just go to a couple, see how you feel and decide after that. A good London one to start with would be U35 weekend drinkies, or perhaps Camden crunch as they are pretty sociable and less shocking lol.   Don't worry about not being sexually experienced, most guys and girls there are newbies looking for a bit of advice and help on the scene. However don't feel you need to become a social butterfly, just because people on this site are. Do your own thing!  Watch out for safety on FL though, such a photos with your face in (if you are concerned about your career) and also, be wary of the usual posers and fakes! Always send out and ask for a personal photo perhaps with a sign with their username by their face or something.   Good luck!:)   Lines, sexual deprivation, sleep deprivation, canings, tickles :( :(   Taking a break is good, but also staying around friends on FL is good. Choice is yours, maybe take some 'me time'   You're very welcome...good luck!   Picture things in your mind, usually his voice is enough to set me off! Um, but mostly just really daydreaming about it!  	7
 I've been trying to, and I think it's actually helping.   Wow thank you a+ you win   Hello, I need help figuring out how to become more social. I know that lots of people just aren't social and that's okay, but it sucks always feeling left out because I'm too scared to talk to anyone. I'm a 15 year old girl, and even from a young age I've never been able to talk to other kids. I have a few really close friends that I can talk to easily, but with everyone else, it's a lost cause. Sometimes when I really want to say something to someone that I don't know well, I'll count to 10 and say it, but it always comes out in awkward stutters. I think my problem is that people will think I'm weird or they don't like me. Online, I'm able to talk to you guys super easily, but if we were face-to-face it would be all kinds of awkward. I know that everyone thinks I'm really nerdy, because I'm in marching band and get really good grades. Even in marching band though, I can only talk to a select few people. I always feel left out from the group, and it kind of sucks, because everyone else is so close. Do you guys have any tips that could help me with my social awkwardness? Because I can't take it anymore.   Woo!  annamarie225 F/15   I know, it just sucks feeling like the weird ugly friend   Yes, my best friend in the world is beautiful, lost about 75 pounds, always has guys all over her, has been in a relationship for almost 2 years, and is really good at making friends. I feel so inferior around her.   Thank you!   8.5/10 could cuddle eternally   http://i.imgur.com/vLIKKZl.jpg  Go for it   *hug*3   Awh sure 3 pm me? :)   Just a rough break up   Jesus Christ    We don't really compete, we just do football games and invitationals and festival. We got a 1 at festival though so that's good   Euph in concert and marching band, and trombone in jazz    I'm Anna, and I need more friends. I like kittens, puppies, music, and sleeping. I play euphonium and trombone in band, and you should pm me c:   WOW WHO ARE YOU   Sounds fun :3 I'm Anna, I'm 15, from Michigan, a sophomore in high school, had a shitty day, and I enjoy marching band, cats, puppies, and not leaving the house all weekend.   You're in marching band so you're automatically perfect tbh   I want a watercolor tattoo. I think something abstract would be cool. I'd like it on my wrist, shoulder, or shoulder blade.   This made me cringe more than the actual post   They do, they're so loyal and I love the energy at the games.   Waterford resident    So do I. I joke about it too but it gets old when people constantly tell you about how much it sucks where you live when they've never even been there.   I messaged you   They're gorgeous but they have a lot of problems. The middle clave on mine is really sticky and gets jammed a lot and everyone in my section has at least one major issue with theirs. I'll message you though since I feel like we're spamming this post haha   Really? That's funny. How come you're jealous of our euphs?   OH MY GOD YOU GUYS ARE GREAT. We were at your invitational last month and you were fantastic and I'm so jealous. What do you play?   Yup! Are you in a Michigan band?   Band: Waterford Kettering Marching Captains  Instrument: Euphonium  Show Name: Music Royale  Repertoire: Bicycle Race by Queen, Hit the Road Jack by Ray Charles, King Kong by Jimmy Castor, Hall of the Mountain King  Unfortunately, as you can probably tell, we don't compete and we're a show band. We just go to invitationals, festivals, and play at parades and football games. We are a very good band though. Straight 1's at festival for the past three years, we got first place from 150 bands at the Mackinaw City memorial day parade, and we're going to be in the Detroit Thanksgiving Day Parade on national television. Last time we went there we got first. I wish we competed though tbh.   Well I don't blame him for getting mad at the professor if he was unprofessional when the question was asked. Of course the slurs weren't necessary but this honestly isn't that cringey   My boyfriend has one of these. The damn thing makes me so uncomfortable.   There were a bunch of teenage girls doing this exact same thing at the Jason Mraz concert I went to   My boyfriend has a body pillow of a female anime character (I have no idea which one) and damn that thing makes me uncomfortable.    He said "I'm glad the bitch is dead."   Shit like this kind of makes me ashamed to be a feminist   What the hell?   My best friend's sister is at Grand Valley State and was actually doing this last night... AND took Facebook pictures   I don't know why you're getting down voted...   Sometimes I hate my state.   Yup, that's it! Thank you!      Well I don't know what I expected.   Air bags are so dangerous. My mom is 4'11 and she would get so injured if the airbag came out. It makes me so worried.   Idek I actually really like that family      Wow that actually made me really sad. I've had a crush on McCrae since day 1 tbh   I honestly would love to see McCrae win veto. He could be such a strong player if it weren't for Amanda.   Agreed.   Did he really? He blocked me because he threatened suicide for like the 5th time, and I knew he was bluffing, so I messaged his aunt and he hates me now   OMG IS THIS ALEX PLEASE TELL ME IT IS I HAVE SO MANY STORIES ABOUT HIM   Oh my gosh I'm in Michigan too, and this year at the senior walk out in my school, and there was a group of like 5 kids all walking together in all camo, head to toe, and mumbling in fake southern accents.   Nah, just some parts.   ^ Same   That fact wasn't fun at all!   Who said the original quote?    I saw a kid do that in elementary school. He just got really bad whiplash.   So do I. Flint scares me tbh.   Wow that sounds like me in about 8th grade. Really that's creepy as hell, they even got the name, state, and "OMG CATSSS" right. Fuck.   Heaven forbid they aren't a Greek god!   As a large-ish girl who goes on Tumblr, this is true. Half the girls on there annoy me so much because they are so picky with guys, and when I say that I prefer chubby guys, some of my friends on tumblr act so confused. Because according to them, all kinds of guys are required to like all kinds of girls and have no say in it, but it's okay for them to talk about how gross bigger guys are. Some girls on there are so shallow, it's crazy.   Lua - Bright Eyes   I will definitely check it out. I know what you mean when you talk about things that speak to you. It sounds great, and like it would help me a lot. Thank you so much for the suggestion.   That made me happy to read, you sound wonderful. Of course you can feel free to PM me anytime you want. It would be great to have a friend to relate to in that way, because I don't have any of those. Thank you for reading about me, and feel free to PM me.   That's exactly how I've been trying to handle it. I've accepted the fact that I'm not over him, but I don't let my friends say bad things about him anymore. I just try not to think about it. He goes to the other high school in my district, so I only see him occasionally at marching band competitions and invitationals. He told my friend that he wanted to get back together with me, but I realized that he would hurt me like that again, so I just didn't talk to him. But I definitely have been moving on and thinking about other guys, and that has helped me. It was rough, but it is getting a lot better. Thank you.   I am a teenage girl who has been dealing with depression and anxiety for about a year and a half. Cutting and suicidal thoughts are things I had issues with for a long time. Before I tell my story, I want to say that finding this, and looking at some of the posts, made me feel less alone. Feeling alone is all too familiar to everyone on this subreddit, and it's amazing that a group of people who are feeling the same things and battling the same things can come together to discuss and guide each other. That's beautiful.  Now for the my story. As a young child, I never fit in. I was always the weird fat girl, and living in a wealthy town full of girls with entitlement issues  didn't help. My mother is very down to Earth, and since it was only her and I living together, we didn't have much money. We were by no means poor, but I didn't live in a fancy house in a nice subdivision, nor did I wear designer brand clothes like all the other kids. My parents divorced when I was two, and my dad was in and out of prison. With all of this being said, I spent most of my time alone and playing by myself when I was little. I had no siblings and no friends to play with.   Then when I was 10 or 11, about to start middle school, my mother made a spur of the moment decision to move to a town about 10 or 20 miles outside the one we were living in. I was not excited. There were some bad areas of the town, and it intimidated me. My mom tried to assure me that I'd make lots of new friends and that everyone would be nicer. I didn't believe her, because I believed that kids were mean, and that's just how it was. I had no idea that there really were nice kids out there. I started middle school and everything was well, and I was amazed when I wasn't made fun of on the first day. I was very introverted, and didn't have any friends until about halfway through the school year, when I started taking to Jessie, a beautiful trumpet player in my band class who I though was extremely cool. I am still friends with her today, and I met most of my other friends though the people that Jessie knew in elementary school. 6th and 7th grade were good, and while I wasn't popular, and was still "the weird fat girl" in some people's eyes, I had a group of friends that I loved. I was content.   Then the summer before 8th grade, my father passed away due to a prescription drug overdose. I tried to avoid it, and pretend that it never happened, which only fueled my mourning. My father wasn't perfect, and there were points where I would only see him two or three times a year, but he loved me. He adored me. In the letters he sent to my the rest of my family, he never shut up about me. The thing that hurt me the most is that the last the we talked was on the phone, and I didn't tell him I loved him. As with all deaths, I mourned and then gradually moved on with my life. When 8th grade started, all was well, and I still had the same group of friends.  About halfway through the year, I developed a crush on a close friend, Brandon. He also came from a broken home, with a dead mother, an abusive father, and being in his grandparents' custody with his older brother. I told him, and in early March we started dating. I loved this boy. He was my first boyfriend, first kiss, and first everything. Being the naive young kid I was, we had sex. Because hey, if he's willing to have sex with me, that must mean he really loves me right? Well as you would expect, he broke up with me shortly afterwards, after coming on a vacation with my family and I for my birthday. About a week after my birthday, he randomly became very distant and would only talk to me briefly once every few days, where we used to FaceTime for hours and hours every day. Then one day I sent him a message and asked what was wrong, and after a short argument, he called me on FaceTime. He said he had to break up with me to "protect me" and we were both sobbing. I didn't hear from him for over a year.   In all honesty, I never really got over him. I still have dreams about him on a nightly basis, and I think he was the thing that really fueled my depression. For once in my life, I felt a mutual love with one of my peers, and then it was gone. I now realize the he used me, and he was very controlling, but I loved him.  I spent weeks and weeks crying over the breakup, but of course, I started getting over it slowly but surely. That was my first experience with cutting. I was sad, and mad at myself, so I grabbed the dull knife from the kitchen and sawed at my arm until there was a swollen cut, with blood oozing out. It felt good. The physical pain distracted me from the mental pain, and for those moments, it relieved my stress.   Through freshman year, cutting was an issue. I continued to earn good grades and smile, but in marching band, a close-knit group of friends, I felt like an outsider. Jessie made new upperclassmen friends, and I was the awkward weird girl who wouldn't talk to anyone. It got really bad in the winter, and those are when the thoughts got more hostile and I felt more alone. I began more and more to sit in my room alone and listen to music, and avoid everyone around me. It was the same routine at this point: wake up, go to school or pretend I was sick, then lay and bed and sulk. I began becoming anorexic, not eating for a couple days at a time. I have since gotten better with eating, although the thought still rises occasionally. I was put on Zoloft when I was 14 as well as attended therapy, and it helped for a while, but now I am falling back into that pit of loneliness. We quit therapy a few months ago because it became too much money for my mom to handle.  Being a teenager, I like to tell myself this is a phase, or a mere hormone imbalance, but at this point I know it's not. Nothing seems beautiful, and I can find sadness and despondence in most everything. I can't shake the lonely, worthless feeling constantly plaguing me, and I needed to tell my story to people who would understand and point me in the right direction. I really feel less alone now, and I can relate to so many of you. Thank you for reading this, and I look forward to being a supportive part of this subreddit.   I bet! John Mayer is great. I saw Jason Mraz last summer, and that was fantastic as well.   Nah, he wasn't here that I know of. I'm in Michigan. Did you?   Yeah, that's what I was thinking. I was leaning towards getting a ball python. Thanks c:   I'll keep that in mind, thanks!   I love Harmony Korine so much. Maybe I'm just a pretentious asshole, but I absolutely loved Gummo. It was so unsettling, I loved it.  	71
 Thank you! Dear god yes   That nug looks like a sinusoidal wave. Anyone?   I have not tried this, nor do i have any experience with edibles, but I came up with this idea while I was really high. So what you would do is bake chocolate sauce with a bunch of kief and dip strawberries and bananas in the resulting sauce. Don't know if this would work...   Kudos to you, I'm way too stressed out during the week to want to do anything other than chill on a Friday.   Tax season keeps the o's rolling in   Sorry that had to happen to you friend. Some people just don't understand.   I don't vape because a vape is 170$+. Also bongs get you way higher than vapes. They are both different highs though.   Do you have any other reason for supporting this initiative other than "I don't like cigarette smoke, therefore nobody should be able to smoke anywhere on campus, because I live on campus"? Your opinion comes across as closed-minded and self-centered.   Just hold your breath. I don't smoke, but I still respect smokers' desire to be able to smoke outside. It's really not a big deal at all. Don't let it rustle your jimmies.   Toking up for you tonight. Good luck with life friend   Good stuff man i would attend   Being high opens your mind to new possibilities and helps you realize that everyone is just like you and that we should all respect one another. I speak from experience when i say that I am more mature and my mind is more open after i started smoking on occasion. You will also feel very happy and appreciate everything around you, like nature, much more as you realize life is the result of a complex set of interacting systems. Toke on, friend.   Honestly I never post, but I felt morally obligated to offer my condolences to any parties involved. :(   Just dropping in to say congrats, that was smooth as silk   I won't lie - the title almost made me downvote the content immediately. Then I noticed it wasn't a self-post. Then I read the attached article. Very well said. I need to work on how quickly I judge posts made on reddit...   College student, RA is never around, never make noise   It looks more like a joint to me. Needs moar weed. Good roll though   I'm not sure I fully understand. Can't you just declare the method as final in Java to prevent subclasses from overriding it? Or is the OOP concept of overriding itself at fault here?   301 reporting :)   i see it. uptoke to bad movies haha   So last night I smoked and then went to eat at a cafeteria. I had grabbed some delicious brownies and was walking back to the table my friend was at who was at a [6] but he handles his shit like a fucking boss. Looked down on the ground and I found what I thought to be 40 bucks. I rush over and pick it up, suddenly aware people probably think I'm baked as fuck.   Anyway when I get back to my table and show my friend I take it out of my pocket and it was actually 60 bucks! At this point I could not handle my shit at all; I had just found the largest amount of cash ever in my life on the ground. I was leaning forward on the table giggling uncontrollably, getting paranoid that someone might have seen me pick it up. But no one did, and me and my buddy left the cafeteria 60 bucks richer. I plan on using it to buy an eighth. Good times.   TL;DR found 60 bucks on the ground, using it to buy an eighth :D   edit: also I really enjoyed the brownie.   I definitely second CLRS, the sections on Red-Black trees and hashing are great. The book even denotes parts that are intended mostly for grad students so if it doesn't make sense then you don't have to panic :)   very good story, read the whole thing. i think you acted very maturely dude, I would have lost my shit if the police put me in cuffs... Congrats everything was cool at the end too. uptoke for chill police and even chiller people   *sits and waits patiently*   Some implementations are a bit messy.  A bit.  Messy.   If you can get your hands on it, try medical or blue dream. Those two get rid of my back pain very effectively.   This. I really enjoy smoking with friends as a social experience because it enhances it. Even if i gotta smoke people up most of the time :)   That was fucking beautiful ;_; Uptoke for great justice  	28
 A bright yellow puffer jacket. I loved my gran but sometimes she picked the most horrendous gifts.    [This was taken on Saturday, before a friends engagement party.](http://imgur.com/PBUDuVm)   I can't pose but I'd just had my hair coloured and was showing it off.   Most offensive, it starts out ok but then turns into a cacophony of hours.   I know, that's why I wasn't sure whether or not to message them again. I don't want them to feel pressurised, it's the delivery service who would be at fault. It's my first time receiving a gift from out of the country and I wasn't 100% sure what the average delivery times were either.  Thanks for advising me about the username issue, I didn't know if I could change it. It sounds sad but I didn't want to lose my trophy haha.      Went to go see The Voices with a few friends. We all work in a pub, some bar, some kitchen. There's a scene where Ryan Reynolds puts Gemma Arterton's head in a fridge. I turned to my kitchen trained friend and said "What's he doing? Raw meat goes on the bottom shelf!"   She broke down in laughter and I heard snickering from behind us.  	6
 I had more or less the same thing happen to my relationship with my ex. She actually did end up leaving me for someone else and now I have lost my best friend.   OP I would caution against it based on my personal experience. I'm sure that it could work out for you but for me it ended really badly and led to a lot of resentment. She just could never truly see me as more than a friend and I spent the last half of the relationship feeling like a place holder. All the best, good luck.   thanks, I was feeling a little of it today, but not as much by any means. I just felt really out of sorts last night and was irritable and scared so I went to the hospital. I probably wasted their time, but I was feeling pretty bad last night.   Right on thanks for sharing. I know personally that I have a lot of the symptoms of a person suffering from bipolar disorder, but like you they seem to think my agitation states are anxiety based. I'm having a bit of a hard time taking their word for it because they even admit there is a similarity. My pdoc has also told me that I'm probably Obsessive only OCD.   Do you mind if I ask what your diagnosis is? do you just have depression? I'm sort of afraid that my reaction might be a result of something worse.   I started the abilify about a month ago at 2 mg, but they bumped me up to a couple of weeks ago. Since then I experienced exactly what you did, feeling like the bones in my legs were trying to escape or that my skin was crawling. I couldn't sit down because my legs were jittery. I have an appointment with my Pdoc on thursday, but I'm not taking any more ability till then. I didn't take it after getting back from the hospital last night and I've had no restlessness or irritability.   Went to the hospital last night because I was having a severe panic attack and couldn't stop my legs from moving. I've been diagnosed with depression and anxiety and have been prescribed 5mg of abilify and 45 mg of mirtazapine for anxiety and depression. For the last few days I haven't been able to get my legs to stop moving and have been having terrible anxiety that's keeping me awake. You know the kind where it's everything stupid you've ever done all at once. Anyway I had a panic attack and drove myself to the hospital because I felt very out of sorts. They prescribed me seroquel on top of what I'm already dealing with so that I could get to sleep. I was just wondering if there are other people here who have experience using anti-psychotics to fight depression and anxiety. Do my doctors think I have something worse and are just not telling me yet? Do you have any experience with abilify or seroquel?   Yup, that's what it's like exactly. I felt like I no master what me and everyone else did it was all trivial   Hi /r/depression. I've found during my battles with depression that I tend to devalue everything around me in an effort to manage my negative emotions. I criticize family, friends, my own interests, basically everything in an effort to bring things down to my level (not on purpose but it still happens.) Have any of you experienced this? I think it's a kind of anhedonia where I not only don't find pleasure in things but I have to devalue them as well. Sort of like there must be a reason I don't get pleasure from those things or people anymore. If any of you share this kind of behaviour I'd love to hear from you. Thanks.   my bad, was meant for /r/depression  thanks    Hi /r/depression so here's my story. Me and my ex girlfriend broke up last may, it was a bad split she started dating again very soon afterward. I was dealing with a serious episode of depression that I'm still fighting and was made worse by the breakup. Towards the end of the relationship there were a some bad fights, suffice it to say my depression had a lot to do with why we weren't working.   Since then I've moved back home with my parents so I can get my head on straight. After months of not talking to each other me and my ex are working on our friendship again and seeing where that goes. She brought up if I was seeing anybody else and I told her I wasn't, that I needed to get my head on straight first. I also told her that I might be moving back to the same city as her and she seemed excited by that news.   The conversation really got me thinking, will I ever be okay enough to really be in a relationship with someone else? I feel like my partner consumes me and I become a codependant mess. I didn't even know who I was after me and my ex split we'd been together so long.   It really scares me, I have bad anxiety too and I can't stop thinking of everything I've ever done wrong, even going back to kindergarden, my memory is a real curse. I want to be able to be there for someone else and have a real relationship someday, but I'm afraid I'll just fall apart again and won't know it until it's too late.   What am I supposed to do? I lost my perfect girl to this disease I'm fighting, I don't know what to say to people when they ask how I'm doing, I feel cloudy all the time because of the medication I'm on.   I suffered from depression and anxiety as a child and through my teenage years, there may have been one year in the last 10 that I haven't felt depressed (basically 10 onward I've been struggling) I don't know what normal feels like, am I so broken? I just don't know what to do or say anymore.   I wish I could fix things with my ex, but I need to fix me first, and I don't know how long that'll take. I wish I could go back to school but I'm afraid the stress might kill me. I don't know it's all too much.  If any of you have been in a similar circumstance please lend some advice, I'm so far up a creek without a paddle I'm pretty much looking at the ocean.    wasn't indoors, was next to the garage. still bad.   I have depression and have been thinking about everything I've ever done wrong so here is the whole god damn fucking list of things I can't get out of my head.  Number 1.  - When I was younger I was really really insecure and wanted to impress other kids, especially moving to a new town and not knowing many people. I never hit anyone but I did get in a few scuffles with kids who didn't deserve it because other kids were egging me on. Man I felt so bad, because I know what it's like to get picked on. FUCK. I'm sorry. 13 years old  Number 2. Told off some kids at soccer practice because they were being jerks about another kids accent. I was super mean and one of them started crying. Their parents heard me.  8 years old    Number 3. Made fun of a handicap kid once because he was acting out and making a scene. His sister heard what I said and started crying. FUCK FUCK FUCK. I'm sorry. 11 years old  Number 4. Once I went on a trip to Europe but our plane got delayed for stupid reasons so I missed a day on the trip and I got pissed at the lady at the airport who seriously couldn't have done anything about it. Didn't make a bit of a scene. FUCK. 16 years old.  Number 5. Trying to impress people, I cheated in my fourth grade chess tournament. Everyone knew I did too. Still lost. 10 years old.  Number 6. Made fun of a kid in front of his mom (who was a substitute teacher) she made me explain why I did that to her. Didn't know she was in ear shot. FUCK.  Number 7. Had a stupid obsession crush on a girl when I was fourteen. When she went to the dance with another guy after turning down my invitation I cried in the bathroom. damn it.  Number 8. Moved again, trying to impress people. Told a bunch of lies which include. Saying I had a friend who committed suicide. Saying I had friends who did all kinds of drugs before moving. I'm such an idiot. fourteen years old.  Number 9. Lit a copy of "The Pearl" by john Steinbeck on fire (with gasoline) for being too straight forward with it's meaning and just a miserable book. Almost burned down my parent's garage. 16 years old.  Number 10. While drunk described to my ex girlfriend's mom how I would have liked to beat up my ex's childhood friend for being such an ass on the school trip to Europe (It was holocaust tour he was an ass). Made a horrible impression. 17 years old.  Number 11. Spent a summer at my Aunt's place was a moody angry teenager the whole time. Watched porn on the family computer, which they all completely knew about. Lied about where I was going sometimes. 15 years old.  Damn it.  Number 12. When george bush visited my state I was in class and watching it on tv, when the motorcade went by the cameras I said "common snipers!" teacher screamed at me. I was a very opinionated 12 year old. I got sent to the principle's office. 12 years old  Number 13. Got drunk and chased my friends around, got sick and made a scene. 16 years old.  Number 14. Lied about going to a concert, when asked about specifics by someone who went I lied and they called me out on not going. So fucking awful. 19 years old.  Anyway that's all I've got for now FUCK.   yeah I'm on medication now, and I've been feeling much better. I've also been exercising and doing mindfulness meditation so I can be very aware of how I'm feeling.   I guess I'm really trying to figure out which part of the anger was "me" and which part was caused by the depression. It was very out of character for me to act in that way. I accept that I'm always responsible. I guess I'm more interested in cause and identity.   I was hesitant starting off, but I'm feeling a lot better about it. My thoughts are clearer, I'm sleeping better, I have an appetite again, I'm not being overly irritated or angry at my loved ones and I haven't experienced any side effects that I've noticed. So it feels great to not be as angry, I feel like I'm getting back to my old self. The therapy is helping a lot too, but I'm functioning now in the meantime.    yeah I'm in therapy and on medication. Since I've been on medication I've been very collected and haven't gotten angry whatsoever. Everyone says that it's so out of character for me.   because I feel guilty and embarrassed. I know I'm responsible, but more is it objectively a result of the depression. I was never like this when not depressed. I guess I'm just trying to figure out where that behaviour came from and to hear other people's experience with it.   You're entirely right.   I've had a few anger/rage episodes which both my psychologist and psychiatrist have said are a result of my depression. I've lashed out at some people close to me and I feel a great amount of guilt about what happened. I know it's not an excuse for my actions by any means, but how responsible do you think we are for anger as a result of our depression. Is it really "us" or is it the depression?   Seriously, depression can cause this, my depression caused me to be a complete asshole for almost an entire year to my now ex-gf. I honestly didn't know what I was dealing with, I was too busy/stressed to care. I didn't take care of myself, was agressive, and generally frustrated/pissed off. Seriously talk to him about this, I know for me a lot of my anger was a kind of call for help. Don't jump to conclusions, but sit down and talk to him about it. Seeing a counsellor would probably help the situation either way.   Hey man, we've got similar stories. My depression and the anger it caused definitely led to the end of my relationship with my girlfriend. I had a whole week were I basically fell of the face of the earth after we had some fights. It's a rough road man, I wish my girlfriend had come back, but at the same time I don't think I'm in any state to date right now.   I feel like I'm a different species all the time. The only way I can function is by putting up a front, it's pretty miserable.   I'm dealing with pretty bad depression, that for the most part stems from those kind of reactions. I always think of all the stupid things I've done and it just brings me down.    Yea, I'm much more reeled in than I was at a young age. Unless I've been drinking, but I think that's just because it takes my anxiety away.   yup that's it exactly, I would be really hesitant to meet anybody but as soon as that passed I'd be overly friendly and energetic. Usually resulting in being called weird or annoying.   Has your anxiety ever caused you to act out? I can remember from a very young age always trying to impress other people because I felt a huge amount of anxiety regarding "fitting in." I'd do stuff just a little bit over the top so that people would recognize me, or I'd inflate stories in an attempt to get people to like me. All of my acting out of course led only to more anxiety.   It feels like a weight pushing down on me just enough to make me hate everything. It makes my thoughts loud, cold, and for the most part logical. I don't cry, it's just numbness, it feels like pressure. You know that feeling you get when you know you've hurt yourself badly like a deep cut or really bad bruise and it's so bad you can't even feel it, well it's like that all the time. Sometimes I get sick of feeling like this, I can only take stuffing it down so long, I used to get angry quite a lot, not these days but I used to. It was just a horrible alternative to feeling nothing.   I have a very hard time relating to people my own age, it's pretty miserable. I can remember being 10 and the only people who I really enjoyed talking to were my teachers. It's still sort of that way, I've been asked to have coffee and chat by a few of my professors because they don't feel I'm operating at an undergraduate level. I can't really relate to the whole "college life" experience or people my own age because I feel like  I've already moved passed that part of my life.  I'd probably trade the intelligence and wisdom/hyper-awareness for better sociability and happiness. I'm not sure that I can have both intelligence and happiness, I just wish I got along better with people.   Classical piano for 15 years. I need music as a stress relief and have realized that it has to remain that way for me. I tried some university education with music and although I did very well my perfectionism ruined it for me and I couldn't listen to music for almost a year afterwards.    I was going to say "My body is a cage" but it was already posted. "If I Ever Feel Better" by Phoenix is pretty accurate.   	30

 Honestly, I think when you're so far down you just don't know where to start, medication is the kick up you need. I still take it at the moment, but my psychologist is considering getting me off them by the end of the year.  When I started on them, it was like day and night. You wake up one morning and its like a switch. You look around and just think... "this is how normal people feel?". While I felt this, it also increased the severity of my lows (basically making me bipolar while I was on them) and it was because of this that I attempted suicide twice. The ones I'm on now (mirtazapine) are much better for me I think. The only downside is it causes difficulties downstairs - something that has caused a bit of trouble between me and my girlfriend.   I totally feel you man. It's so hard at the start, when you suddenly realize how far down you are, and the climb to the top looks so hard. It is really hard. Its all about baby steps and focusing on what you have already accomplished instead of what is yet to come, what you still have to do or what you've failed at. You've already accomplished something today by reaching out to me - my feedback and even reading your own comment can help you feel better or have a greater understanding of your situation. I never liked keeping a record of things - I used to keep a (private) blog and journal, but I found that reading over my dark thoughts actually made me feel even more depressed - I was frightened of who I was and what I was saying.  Try your best to find someone you can trust. Don't hate them if they can't understand - if you don't understand what's going on with you than there's no way they're going to. Just let them know that all you really need is someone to listen to you. That's all you need. It gets better, there's a light at the end of the tunnel etc. I know it sounds dumb and honestly, when I was at my darkest I would literally scoff at advice like the stuff I'm writing now, but its so true. You need to understand and accept that you are viewing the world incorrectly, your perceptions are altered, skewed negatively. An important thing to do is try to observe your thought process. Actually listen to what you're saying in your head, watch how you react to things. When you truly start to do this, you start to realize how irrational some of your thoughts are, and you can start to try and change them.   Good luck, and from one human being to another, I care about you. 3 Feel free to PM me.   Yeah I'm 17. I'm really not that smart, I just have a way with words because I (used to) read a lot. Thanks for the recommendation, I'll pick it up from the local library when I get the chance. :)   Through the help of medication, lots and lots of therapy and hard work. The first step is, as everyone always says, reaching out. You really do need that hand up out the hole before you can start doing things on your own. Its a slow and painful process, and for me it contained many many setbacks. But I pushed on and got myself to a functioning, happy state (and consistently feeling this way!). If you haven't reached out to a family member or close friend yet, I sincerely suggest that you do.   Yes, I understand that, I sorta mean "I won this round" and feel ready to win all the ones that are sure to come after it. (see my above comment). Next time I hit a roadblock I feel I'll be able to deal with it much better.  edit: since I believe my depression is the chemical kind, (not due to environmental factors) I understand that it's something I'm going to have to manage for a very long time, possibly the rest of my life. I'm okay with that.   Downvote, hide, move on. These posts reach the top because people upvote them. You are in a minority.    Launchers can't move the notification bar, only hide it. Notification bar on the bottom is something that must be baked into the rom.   Thanks so much. I'm not really all the way out of the woods just yet, but I have come so far in the last three years (had depressive symptoms for about 2 years before I was diagnosed 12 months ago) and learned so much. I know its something that I'm going to have to manage for pretty much my whole life, but I feel prepared and empowered to do so. :)   Its not new. Flash a stock ROM with Odin.    No worries. Seriously dude... you are just wrecking shit up tonight/today. You've bounced back awesomely after the Play Store fiasco and are obviously working very hard to make yours the best Reddit app there is. Its definitely the best looking at the moment, and if it keeps improving the way it has been there will honestly be no competition whatsoever... congrats.   IMHO [this](http://i.imgur.com/q9rfO.png) looks way better, but to each their own I guess.    Are you seriously able to compare [this](http://i.imgur.com/stHzx.png) to [this](http://i.imgur.com/z2clm.png) and tell me that RiF looks better?   [Screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/z2clm.png)  edit: just realized that this is [already an open issue on the github](https://github.com/laurencedawson/reddit-sync-development/issues/84), but it's almost two months old. Is there any particular reason why its taking so long to fix?   RIF is functional but ugly.   Just off the top of my head:  * Sidebar viewing * Intents (handling reddit.com links like you said) * Sharing a link to posts that aren't self posts * RES-style advanced comment/post formatter/edior   Reddit News is way more functional but Reddit Sync is *way* better looking. I personally have both installed.   There are still loads of features missing when compared to Reddit News...   Mine probably got up voted because its a self post - I don't get any karma for it. Yours was a link.    Yeah it's still missing a bunch of features such as sidebar, sharing comments and a few others. I really want to make this my main, but its still not quite as functional as Reddit News.   Technically they coded their own implementation.

Otherwise nothing, just do what you want and use it as a phone.    What do you want to do that requires rooting? If you can't think of a reason to root then there's really no point in doing it. Stay stock for a little while, learn the ropes. Rooting is really not necessary for a first time user, and the stock experience on the s3 is pretty good.    Do you have a custom recovery installed? Wipe cache, dalvik-cache and fix permissions.    /r/gifs is a default, no? Both of these posts appeared in my /r/all when they were posted, at any rate.   Could have waited a bit longer than 2 months.  http://www.reddit.com/r/shutupandtakemymoney/comments/wsxym/sweet_bench_that_turns_into_a_picnic_table/ http://www.reddit.com/r/gifs/comments/ws4a7/transformer/   No need to install any apks, just saying that CM will come with a different messaging app than you're used to.    I'll never understand why people love this ROM so much. Its bloated, slow and the dev has themed every single inch of it with ugly, tacky metallic backgrounds and blue hues. Ugh.    Facebook sync can be rectified with HaxSync, force closing of apps  with back button is present in CM10, and the Touchwiz (Samsung stock) messaging app won't come with an AOSP ROM, but with the AOSP MMS.apk.    You won't, as long as you ONLY root. If you install a custom ROM or mess with system files, you probably won't get offered the OTA. Installing the OTA will *un*root you however.   If its stock then you should still get an update notification. I don't know how well a deodexed ROM will play with the official update, though. It's probably safer to go fully stock and then install the OTA. Or just wait until someone puts up a deodexed JB build.   not sure if trolling.   wat   Flashing back to stock will unroot you. AOSP roms will improve greatly now that kernel source code for the S3 has dropped. You shouldn't have any problems with updating as long as you do a data wipe first.   Noob question: will this help at all with CM10 for the SGS2?   visit him. seriously. nothing would make his day, his whole *year* more than his best friend just being there when he walks out of the place.   Anyone older than 15 really. 17 here and I remember the macerena very clearly.    The RAZR M is a mid- to low-range phone. That's just the quality standard for low-end phones these days, isn't it great? :D   **Hey r/android, please be aware that OP is not talking about the Razr Maxx, but is instead talking about the newer [Razr M](http://www.gsmarena.com/motorola_razr_m-4974.php) that is coming out soon.** OP should ignore all recommendations in this thread because everyone is talking about the **Razr Maxx** - they're [two completely different phones.](http://www.gsmarena.com/compare.php3?idPhone1=4974 idPhone2=4666)  OP: The Razr M has a smaller, lower resolution screen when [compared with the Galaxy Nexus](http://www.gsmarena.com/compare.php3?idPhone1=4974 idPhone2=4219) (4.3in, 540x960 vs 4.65in, 720x1280). It has an arguably better processor and but on the software front the Galaxy Nexus will offer a *much* better experience. The Razr M has a larger battery and a smaller screen, so I think its safe to say that battery life will be less of a problem on the Razr M than the Galaxy Nexus. You must also decide whether expandable storage is important to you - Galaxy Nexus doesn't have an SD card slot while the Razr M does.  Personally, I'd go the Galaxy Nexus. Guaranteed software updates for at least the next two major versions of Android + a bigger and better resolution screen.   [Razr M != Razr Maxx](http://www.gsmarena.com/compare.php3?idPhone1=4974 idPhone2=4666)   The Droid Razr M is one of the newer mid-range phones that Motorola has put out. OP is not talking about the Maxx.   Honestly, probably because it was the best-looking one on the store. Either that or a competitor is playing dirty.      This. Nothing comes close to that feeling in your chest when you find yourself on the floor, yet again, and realize that you really can't take another day. Hug for you dude/dudess.   RR is a bloated piece of shit with a disgusting theme. I don't know why so many people love it.    [Unofficial builds for the Intl. SGS2 (i9100) on Goo.im](http://goo.im/devs/aokp_s2/AOKP-i9100) if anyone's interested.   [CM10 nightlies are coming along nicely.](http://get.cm/?device=i9100) It won't reach "stable' status for a while, because they're having trouble with hwcomposer (which means that Project Butter isn't completely there for the SGS2 at the moment.) **Note**; this is for the **International Galaxy S II** (i9100), if you have a carrier variant than you'll have to go to its relevant XDA forum.    If you have a recovery installed, wipe cache, dalvik-cache and fix permissions. If you're 100% stock then a factory reset will also fix it.      http://i.imgur.com/9zjG8.jpeg   Both aokp and cm9 support software keys. It can be activated in the settings.    Wat   Install a Rom with software keys.    Commenting to enter.    There's an app called AppExtractor - this can restore messages from a nandroid.   XDA developers is your best bet: http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1674286. The intl. GS3 is officially supported by CM, you can find nightlies here: http://get.cm/?device=i9300   Yes I realize that, but the only real difference is the name of the release channel.    I'd recommend both of those things (SiyahKernel + CM10) but honestly, the only way you're gonna be able to tell is just try it for yourself. Make a nandroid and test it for a day or two, and if you like it then keep it. Everyone's experience is different.    [Huh?](http://get.cm/?device=i9100)   Read by comments above about anecdotal evidence on the issue.   No shit, its my photo and its meant to be over-exaggerated - its a family snap that I shared with friends and family. I was simply showing the OP what happens when you do the technique I described.   The point I'm making is, it should not have been posted here in the first place.    100% agree with you. From a consumer perspective, its a perfect solution - in typical Apple fashion, too. Sure we can rant and rave about how non-standards-compliant or compatible it is, but at the end of the day, Apple has provided a solution to an existing problem - however limiting that solution may be. Its excellent for Apple; not so good for the rest of mobile technology. Apple has never seemed to give a fuck about anything other than profit though. This ties in perfectly with their existing vision.   Perhaps. There doesn't seem to be anything other than anecdotal evidence on the topic. Many of my friends use (or did, until they switched to iPhone) Nokias and a few have used Samsung (non-android) phones (with some sort of Java-based OS), and this problem has occurred. (In Australia, on various telcos, if that makes any difference).   There's a difference between posting an up-and-coming band that a few people in the subreddit know of and posting [a band that has hit #1 in the UK.](http://www.gigwise.com/news/42517/list.gigwise.com)   [This](http://wiki.cyanogenmod.com/wiki/Samsung_Galaxy_Note:_Full_Update_Guide) will take you from 100% stock to a custom rom - when you get up to "Flashing Cyanogenmod", simply replace the "latest version of Cyanogenmod" with the PA flashable .zip. Good luck!   Because they both support the format? Seems kind of obvious...   Haha, I know that feel. Normally I just ignore it, but today I felt like being a bit of a dick.   Its sad how true this is. I almost feel like its an underhanded way of enticing users to buy into the platform - so many times I've seen people with Android phones receive MMSes from iPhones with this issue, they mention it to the person who sent it to them next time they see them, and the person laughs and says something along the lines "oh well, it wouldn't happen if you had an iPhone." - so people start to think its a problem with their phone, not the other way around.    The Kooks are pretty well known (well, amongst people in my age bracket), but they're not exactly "one of the worlds shittest bands".   This deserves its own submission.   From the sidebar: Listentothis is a place to discover new music, new or overlooked artists   Its a problem on the iPhone end, it has nothing to do with Android. Apple have decided to use a non-standard format of MMS.   Wow thanks OP, the Kooks are so underground, I've never heard of them before. What a gem.   No, I'm sorry, but backups should always be made when flashing something, especially for newbies. That's great that that works for you, but there have been times when I've flashed a new version of a kernel or ROM and my phone didn't boot because of a mistake that the developer made.   No worries, good luck!   According to its XDA-developers thread, if the app TriangleAway is installed and used on the ALE8 firmware, it will reset the flash counter and remove "System is modified" from Download Mode. [The thread can be found here](http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1494114).   You're asking the wrong questions. What do I want to eat? Yum, I feel like some mac   cheese. Who do I feel like talking to? Talk to them. Ask them how their day was.   So maybe you cut yourself tonight - that's okay. You'll go longer without cutting next time. Put it in the past.   Things aren't happening to throw you back into your depression - sure, it seems like that, but depression is a failure in thinking and correctly assessing situations. Your depression is overwhelming you, it is using these things that happen in your life as an excuse to get the better of you. People are shit. Its a fact. People will always fuck you over. Find people that don't and don't fuck them over either.  Is there anything specific that has made you feel this way at the moment?    Congratulations on finding a release. Now you know what helps you, the only thing you need to focus on is finding the motivation to do it when you start feeling down (I often find that's the hardest part. Doing things you know will make you feel better - sometimes you just don't want to.)  I find bike riding, playing video games and watching a particular scary movie achieves this for me. Be careful you don't cross the line into escapism though - by merely using these things as a "distraction" instead of actual stress relief, you are simply ignoring your problems and letting them get bigger. When I was really bad, I would play video games or go for a really exerting bike ride, but I would only feel better *while* I was doing these things - the second I stopped and my mind wandered from the task at hand, I immediately felt like shit.  Anyway, hope you're having a fantastic night. :) Thanks for sharing your awesome news with us.      Yeah people's first impressions have all seemed to be "Dude, did your sister have a stroke or something?" haha   So... Google Play?   Nightlies of the same ROM are generally pretty safe to dirty flash. Just make sure to wipe cache and dalvik, and **always** make a nandroid backup before flashing anything.    Are you sure? Your camera icon in [this](http://i.imgur.com/9zc2i.png) picture doesn't seem to be in that theme.      What icon theme is that?   1/100s f/3.5 ISO 200, Canon 20D w/ 18-55 kit lens @ 18mm      Do you have a custom recovery installed? Try wiping cache, dalvik-cache and fixing permissions from recovery.    Have you tried clearing data for Play Store and Google Service Framework and rebooting?   For step 6, you can also lift the bottom end of the RGB curve to make the blacks look flat. Like [this](http://www.flickr.com/photos/lukeboland/7919616866/in/photostream).   Not sure if being serious or mocking other commentor.   So explain to me why swiping away Facebook while uploading a photo doesn't stop the upload, and why swiping away goo manager during a download doesn't stop a download, when killing both of those apps with a task manager or from the settings does?   No, it doesn't. Swiping it away from the multitasking view politely asks the app to close - its up to the developer whether or not their app actually stops running in the background from that command.    Ahh true, my apologies, I misread the post. OP, try flashing the ICS gapps again, wipe cache, dalvik and fix permissions (usually under advanced  fix permissions).   Not sure why its doing this, maybe it was trying to check for an update when you didn't have a signal (or data connection)? Anyway, now is the perfect time to swap to [AdAway](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.adaway feature=search_result#?t=W251bGwsMSwxLDEsIm9yZy5hZGF3YXkiXQ..), a much better alternative IMO.   If the compatibility checker says its unable, then I don't think there's any way around it, unfortunately. It has something to do with the Bluetooth hardware, and the compatibility checker checks your device if the Bluetooth chip has the capability.    New android version = new gapps version. [Here](http://goo.im/gapps/gapps-jb-20120726-signed.zip) you'll find the latest gapps available for JB. Flash that, clear cache and dalvik, reboot, should all be sweet. Good luck. :)   Clock, stopwatch, alarm and countdown timer are all available in one app. This is what I'm talking about....   It is already, no? http://i.imgur.com/4N46s.png pressing the world "Alarm" takes me to the alarms screen. I thought this was apart of AOSP?   It doesn't.    http://i.imgur.com/wI0cB.jpeg         While there are a lot of better alternatives out there, I think people just use it now because back then, there *weren't* any usable alternatives. Go Launcher was fast, light, and highly customizable. GO apps have only become bloated in the last ~12 months.   I think the camera app comes in the gapps package - have you flashed the latest one?   http://wiki.cyanogenmod.com/wiki/Samsung_Galaxy_S_II:_Full_Update_Guide  Where it says download the latest version, use this. Good luck. :)     	110

 Haha its my highschool senior picture for the yearbook :)      ive had my blonde since my 9th grade year, and now im a 12th grader. i really dont want to part with it when i have to get a job.... :(   Grouch Marx mustache = her eyebrows   New pictures are up :)      im working on it :) the holiday season keeps me busy at work!  EDIT: The new pictures are up!    My "long side" of the haircut was maybe up to my collarbone when i first got it, and i HATED it so much, but i too my moms advice and let it grow out and im soooo glad i did!   our routine is almost identical! but my main question is: do you use liquid or powder foundation? i use powder, so i hope that if i apply concealer on top it wont look cakey.    the glamoflauge Lite comes in na double ended crayon, so i apply the lighter concealer first and then the darker/peachier shade to conceal even more. i then blend the corners with a blending sponge, but i find that my problem area (dark circles) arent concealed as well as i had hoped   Army strong    Oh my goodness I used to get that ALL the time! My freshman year of highschool my hair was long and burgundy and everyone would tell me that!! And thanks so much :)    I'm not sure its a joke... She was pretty instagram famous (~4k followers) but half of then were haters telling her that her brows looked terrible. So now she's going "all natural" and combing her brow hairs upwards so they look all furry. I dont think she understands that her new trend isn't helping her...      I decided to cave in and buy Hard Candy's Glamoflauge Lite concealer because i ran out of IT cosmetics bye-bye under eye. I tried it out today and i saw no visible change for my extremely dark circles under my eyes. I read up on MUA that it would work better if i applied above my foundation, but i wear powder so i dont know if that will work... Does anyone have any suggestions on how to get the best coverage out of Glamoflauge? Because i really want it to work!    [srs] she actually reposted it. she took more pictures, but in the original she did some artsy angle where you couldnt even see the pink eyeshadow, and even in the repost you can barely see it....      My favorite color is dark green! Its enchanting and reminds me of a Forest and contrasts well with my skin tone. My favorite shade is Melt cosmetics Blow! Seriously, its gorgeous  Pantone   Do you know if the gamepiece comes with UD orders from Ulta? I ordered a butt ton of UD products for cyber Monday so I'm just wondering if its possible to get ome   I have been dying to get my hands on the Limecrime Venus palette, and I even signed up for email alerts for when its back in stock...m but I cant justify buying a $50 eye shadow when I could probably find dupes for $20. Its the packaging that makes mw want it :(   Name it "Afteryu" and when people ask "hey, what did you name your boat?" you can reply "afteryu", and the people will automatically be flattered that you named the boat after them, but when they see the name of the boat they will feel like idiots   Definitely the Real Techniques kits! They're pretty in expensive for the quality as well   A few weeks ago I received CC that I should try to fill in my brows more and to try out a more "dewy" look. I took the advice, so what do you think?

 Every young guy gets overly hung up on the idea of getting laid and kissing girls. I won't deny that it is fun, but it is nowhere near as important as society/the media makes it out to be. The annoying thing is you won't truly accept that, regardless of how many times you are told, until you get laid, look back and see for yourself. Vacations are also fun experiences, but there is no need to feel suicidal if you haven't got to travel yet, it will just come later. There is so much more to life.  What's more, it isn't as if *everyone* around you is getting laid like you think. That's just another misconception- sex is sensationalized to such a degree very few people your age will openly tell you they are virgins even if they are. I can think of a few guys I know in their mid 20s who have never had sex and there is nothing wrong with them, they are decent looking, have normal social lives, college degrees and good jobs, it just didn't happen yet with them. (Thinking back I had short, sexual relationships with two women before my current long term girlfriend and if I would have chosen to stay at home the night I met these girls, or approached other, less interested, people instead there is every chance I would be in the same situation as you). Don't be too hard on yourself.   Having said all this, there are plenty of ways you can increase your chances of finding yourself a girl. Get out there more and increase your social circle by going to local events, classes or bars with your friends. Go to the gym and pay attention to the clothes, shoes, hairstyle etc. that you present yourself with. Have hobbies and interests outside of just hanging out with friends/girls so that you have other things to focus on while you're single and something to talk about with your girl when you eventually meet her. Hell, there are even apps now that let you speak to girls in your local area who rate you as attractive! Use them for practice if anything.  The best advice I can give you is to chill out. Don't be obsessed with girls, don't be obsessed with yourself (as this shooter was, though obviously that was a problem with his own mental health) and find a few cool hobbies that will give you something else to do and make you look interesting to the girls you meet in the future.    I think people from Europe generally have a completely different perspective from Americans when it comes to timescale. Growing up in England my childhood home was built in the 1840s, and that isn't at all uncommon. The school I went to was founded in the early 1600s. European cities often contain buildings that are *thousands* of years old so we can truly appreciate how short our lives are in the grand scheme of things. My mum knew people who were around at the same time as Abraham Lincoln.. its really not that long ago at all.  Edit: Just did some reading and found out that if my old school was in the United States it would be the 11th oldest building in the country and my town's little church would be top 5. Crazy.   Hey man, you're right, life sucks real bad sometimes. We've all screwed up at some point, we all have regrets. Its not healthy to keep thinking back to the past.   I have a little experience with what you've been through. I messed up and my best friend, the girl I thought I'd be with forever, broke up with me aged 18. It was hell on earth at the time because she cut me entirely out of her life and for a very long time I thought about her every single day. Looking back, the fact that we had no contact after the break up is one of the best things that could have happened for me. It may be tough to hear but it sounds like she really doesn't want to be with you, and that is her choice. You are young. There are literally billions of other girls in the world and if you keep pushing through things will change. You will start to move on. It may take years, but you will find someone else and you will be happy again. And when it happens you can look back and thank yourself for holding on in the darkest times to allow a better future to arrive.  She'll always have a place in your heart. The first girl you fell in love with will always be a special thing in your life, you'll never really forget her but you will slowly move on and the strong feelings will pass. Trust me when I say there is someone else out there who you *will* love in the future, they *will* love you back and, if you want to, you *will* spend your lives together- and it will be far more special than this first girl.   Cut her out of your life. Allow yourself to slowly move on no matter how long it takes and how much you want to give in. You will have a bigger chance at love. It happened for me and everyone I know, it will happen for you. You just need to eventually find the strength to go out there and get it.  	3

Reddit won't let me change titles.   FFXIV feels incredibly empty and solo-friendly. I joined Balmung for roleplay, but the RP community practically ignores you if you're not some "notice me senpai" Miqo'te in one of their little cliques.   No its very easy to catch up in WoW. I quit because the new xpac is more of the same, but my guildies are enjoying it a lot.   The 980 is a luxury item compared to the 970, so they have free reign to charge whatever they want and know people will still buy it as it's the #1 in the world.  Personally I went for a 970 and used the money I would have spent on a 980 to get a QNIX 1440p monitor. Far Cry 4 maxed at 53-60 FPS!   Christianity's "cliff note" is on our sidebar. "For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life."    (Note: I do not work for SOE in any capacity)  lol   I got a Cardboard and E:D with it was awful. Google Cardboard is a novelty at most, something fun for a couple minutes with VR-supported android games.   I'm ugly and I'm proud!   I'm sure they're great, but as a game dev and writer myself, it is hard to get into the same plot again when you know everything that will happen. Same issue with Far Cry 4, but Pagan Min is intriguing enough to continue.   Congratulations. I pray you have a long and happy marriage :)   This is WoW for me. I am unsubbed from WoW now due to new expansion burnout but it will probably drag me away from FFXIV in a few months   How do you have so much time?   Is it still the same BioWare story? A villain emerges. You get tasked with assembling a team to combat said villain. You then spend some time doing side missions and building sidekick loyalty, meanwhile you do 2-3 main missions to further the main plot. You do a mission and discover villain hideout, master plan or both. You do a big epic finale. End.   I'm ugly and I'm proud.   A hi-fi indie space dogfighter with 10~ maps and some different modes and about 5 ships is maybe worth $20 at most.   lol   Heated seats and windows?

While all of you are complaining, I was able to make a character after having just bought the game on sale this afternoon!  No longer need to get up at 6AM tomorrow for Balmung :D   Practically every fantasy F2P MMO on the market can fill your needs....   Lineage ~~Two~~ One is most popular after WoW.   Mortal Online is a dying, empty POS.   Does the gil offer only work on Hyperion?    Take a break unless it is a game that you really want to play. I got a bunch of new games recently from Black Friday, but the only one I desire to play is Skyrim. Even the new WoW xpac bores me.   I am Christian myself so overly "gamer l33t" stuff like this with Jesus tacked on makes me cringe a bit, but a friend tipped me off about [Game Church](http://gamechurch.com/) a while back.  They basically are an on-line ministry that goes to big gaming events like E3, where they get involved in the community through a Christian gamers podcast, forum, hand out free Bibles, etc.   If World of Warcraft interests you, there is a guild called Old Farts which is mostly comprised of 30+ years, the average being in their early 40s. My own WoW guild is mostly late 20s to late 30s, with a few in their late 40s even.  There are plenty of guilds your age, but they require a bit more effort to find.

I don't need RAM that much but I can sell you the card for 165.   Similar question as OP; I mainly play WoW, space sims (Star Citizen) and the odd FPS like Far Cry 3. I got a 970 from newegg, do you think that can run 1440p, 144 or 4k? Which should i look at getting and is 4k worth it with only one card? My mobo is incapable of doing SLI.   The pirates are so powerful they blew up the moon   http://i.imgur.com/QPLpNdk.jpg   http://i.imgur.com/QPLpNdk.jpg   Sounds reasonable. I'll bump down my OP then to $165 OBO   That's why I included or best offer. How much would you pay for it?      He is banned from posting, that's why he will PM you instead   I have a GTX 670, $150 shipped.   If brictop comes to you in a PM, ignore him. He is a scammer and known to resell his Black Widow mechanical keyboard   Does 2 year insurance on a starter really matter that much? You'll be out of your Aurora and into a 300 or Cutlass within a few weeks I'd imagine.  Keep your package, it has alpha and will save you money long run.   Like I said - its an optional subscription if you want to see more behind the scenes stuff every month. The game just requires a pledge package for now   No   It's a development subscription - you get access to the magazine, a forum I think, some concept art. It's basically an additional way of supporting CIG and you get some cool Making-Of stuff on the side each month   Teach me your secrets.   Confirmed this is me. I couldn't post from this account as I was getting Reddit's anti-spam pop-up "Your last posts didn't do well."   Well I did just [list my account for sale](http://www.reddit.com/r/Starcitizen_trades/comments/2n1rmf/black_market_890_jump_specter_lti_m50_amd_mustang/), since I'd have no idea what to do with all the credits I'd rather just make a new account and buy an Aurora.   Can confirm, I am the same person. Wanted to get the post out there but couldn't do it from this account due to Reddit's self-posting rules to reduce spambots.   The annual subscription is $240 as well. I am considering doing what OP did...but I have 740 in credit if I did that.   Well now I feel guilty for owning an 890 Jump  Edit: sold everything for $700, still have amd mustang and $40 credit to spare for future modules.   Aurora LN is the best for that. LX is simply the "deluxe" version, which means it comes with a jump drive (that you can buy for the LN) and a leather seat (and who cares about that because it's a game).   I'd take a GTX 980 over a picture of a spaceship any day   Yeah, 6000 freight units (compared to 1600 in my 890) is nothing to scoff at...   Nothing yet. I have the Super Hornet upgrade, UEE Coat and Pistol sitting in my cart ($65 total). I am considering melting my Specter Package and buying a Merchantman, or melting my 890 Jump and getting 2-3 different ships. Or melt both packages for $740 total to get a ton of stuff   I'd melt the Cutlass for the Freelancer personally. The freelancer appeals to me more, but they're both good ships.   Get more insurance?   All of my ships are untradeable as I melt - buy - melt etc.   Someone pointed out to me the MM may be the most difficult to get as its an alien ship. The others, Starfarer and Caterpillar (I am not interested in the Ret/Glad) would be quite easy to obtain if you had the in-game credits for them.  So I am deciding if I should scrap buying the Hornet Upgrade for my Specter pack, and just go with a MM.   I have a Specter Hornet Ghost package from last year w/ LTI. Maybe I should melt that and pick up a MM   I don't think it will, based on my ~~3 second~~ in-depth analysis of the one concept picture they've released.  Why would it need to? It's just a trade ship. All it needs is a big cargo container and some guns.   You'd barely be able to pilot it too. I could *maybe* understand if you were the leader of say...TEST and had lots of money and hands available to help pilot. But you and I are single pilots - the most expensive ship I have is a Jump and even now I'm considering melting down to something smaller.   I wouldn't be either. People love to throw away their disposable income.   Looks really cheap. I'd pay a dollar at most   $2500 for a spaceship? No fucking way   Banu for commerce, hands down every day of the week. The retaliator is a bomber and little more.  Caterpillar is more of an in-between, as its designed for boarding and trade.   I have been eyeing the Banu MM and Starfarer for quite a while. I love the dirty, more cyberpunk feel to the ships than the 890 Jump. But the Jump is limited edition.  Do you guys think I should hang onto it? Right now my cart has the Super Hornet Upgrade, UEE Coat and the Aurora LX.   Absolutely. Best MMO on the market in the "theme park" genre. Everything about the game screams polish. WoW is the only MMO I can install, jump into and simply play without having to dick around with controls, graphics, annoying UI or weird mechanics. It's fairly simple, it's fun and it works.  On the 21st they're having their 10th anniversary special day, where they're releasing a special 40-man raid with a free mount, pet and helmet.   I'll be Gus, the lovable engine sweep; clean as a whistle, sharp as a thistle, best in all Westminster, yeah!   It was just vapor lock!   because of some phony god's blessing?   http://imgur.com/gKvVQLH   The best way to start would be in prayer and in the Bible. Pick a Gospel (I recommend John) and get reacquainted with scripture. Ask lots of questions and try to understand what the author is writing (or what Jesus is saying). Perhaps get a biblical commentary to help you understand the underlying themes and meaning.  Additionally,    I no longer go to church  Start going to church. Ignore that crap on the Internet about "existential Christianity" or "home churches." Find a real church. It doesn't matter what kind to start, as long as they practice sound doctrine. Catholic, Anglican, Lutheran, Baptist, it really doesn't matter since they teach essentially the same thing: God loved the world so much he sent his only Son, so that whoever believes in Him will not die but have everlasting life.  Ask your friends for some church recommendations or maybe go with them one Sunday. I know you're introverted (so am I), but make an honest effort, ask God in prayer, to get out of your shell and get connected with other Christians. Join a life/study group, volunteer at charity events and give yourself to the poor.   Is it possible for me to do this in the comfort of my room  No. A Christian is called to go out into the world and *interact* with other people. Christ didn't sit in Nazareth and send people out to do his bidding - he went into the towns and ate with sinners and healed the sick.   I'm thinking of contacting my old friend but I know she is very busy..  If she is the Christ-loving girl you make her out to be, she probably won't care and would love to sit down and talk with you. Make the effort, give her a phone call. Don't email her, don't text her. Call. Her. Phone.  Good luck buddy.   Use the search function since this has been discussed many, many times.  Essentially as a Christian you're to follow the law of the land (whatever state/country you reside in). If cannabis is illegal, you can't smoke it. If it is, go nuts, but do it in moderation as to not become addicted.   I am guessing you don't have a toddler or spent any time around young children to see how incredibly selfish we are before we learn about etiquette and being good. Kids are assholes to each other.  It's the Christian belief we are sinful and broken *by nature,*  This sinfulness is a condition we brought upon ourselves and cannot be rectified by ourselves. You don't even need a history book or a TV to see evidence of this - sin permeates all societies of mankind, big or small.   Because meaning would be defined arbitrarily, simply on the whim of the individual. Who has the final say without some universal standard? These are the questions I asked myself for 10+ years on my path back to Christianity from Atheism.  I am not claiming to know anything; they're just fun questions to challenge ourselves with once in a blue moon.   But again...there is no point to their lives either, so why bother reduce suffering? In the words of Rust, we've become too self aware. Why not all just walk into that one last sunset?   That line of reasoning makes no sense   We need more Jews (and Orthodox) here. You guys tell it like it is.   If it bleeds it leads.   You millenials can't take a joke.   DAE euphoria?   They also believe Jesus is literally the Son of God, not just Protestants.  Source: am anglican/catholic    we could just as easily start a cult where we make all the adherents do their best to actually act and live as they believe 'Jesus' would have acted and lived, had he been in their shoes.   So, Christianity?   Simpson sleeps nude in an oxygen tent, which he believes gives him sexual powers.   I hate every chimp I see from chimpan-a to chimpanzee.   Takes insult for no reason. Uses unecessary quotes. Tries to catch sympathy over nothing.  Definitely a millenial.   Well raids scale now so they soloed the 10-man version   But I bring you love :(   Following all of the Quran, God's Word, to the letter. It has some nasty stuff in there.   Muhammad had a 9 year old wife. How can you call a religion one of peace and love when its founder was a paedophile?  Those extremists are fundementalists, I.e. they follow Islam to the tee. Most Muslims are moderate and ignore the evil in their own hadith and Quran. I'd say this is God acting in their hearts to be more Christ-like.   No and likely never will considering he deleted his twitter and reddit account.  I am just thankful we have our sub back with competent, fair moderators.   No, it's not, but that shouldn't excuse the frankly bullshit "apology" he gave us, then he has the audacity to start a charity drive for an anti-bullying NGO? Are you fucking kidding me mate?  He's trying to cover up his own personal failings with the moral high ground and I'm glad most people in this thread are seeing through the bullshit.   He has no proof of said calls. He doxxed himself with a dating profile he posted. He is a known liar and general dickhead, frequent bully who uses the word fag like everyone else on the Internet. He's now being bullied and trying to cover his tracks. He has yet to apologize for his childish behavior.  No sympathy.   /r/wow had its own Siege of Orgrimmar.  You all get Nitesmoke Wolf Mounts and title: Name, Liberator of LGBT Rights as a reward. No heirlooms.  	104
 We don't air our dirty laundry in public. We try to keep family problems to ourselves. But in a small town, it's hard, word gets around. We also don't take the bait and engage with antagonizers.   I have a mid 2010 macbook pro that still works great. When I felt it was slowing down I wiped the entire thing to brand new. I also know someone with a 7 year old macbook pro and it works just fine, no problems, it just needed a new battery.   As someone who has helped to take care of younger cousins since I was 11, and babies from when I was 17 and up, a healthy 4 month old is fairly easy to take care of. But then again, I want to go into childcare and love kids!   I was a vegetarian for only a year. It was easier to be a vegetarian in the city (vegetarian friendly restaurants, fresh cheap veggies, fruits, etc) but once I returned home to my native american hometown, it was hard. I tried until I relented and became a pescatarian. Then I relented some more and accepted traditionally harvested meat into my diet. So, vegetarian no more. Once I went back to the city I didn't know if I could start over again. I do want to become a vegetarian again. Possibly when my roommate and I finish our store of meat in our freezer.   I'm incredibly careless with my stuff. I have a habit of tossing them around when I'm done with them. Also, I'm clumsy.   I have a relative like this. He also has very little filter so will say inappropriate things. He's deeply embarassed me a few times with his loud voice and ramblings that included me somehow into a topic. So... I now avoid him when I can.   I've always wanted to learn more about horses and take horse riding lessons. It's a dream of mine. Now I'm scared I'll turn into this.   Sounds like my kind of party!   123wpm. I already knew I was a slow reader but wow, I am slow. I like to build the image in my head though so I re-read paragraphs and make mental notes of character names and other bits of info because I have terrible memory.   I had no idea the Superbowl was tomorrow. Aaaaaaaand I still don't care.   I'm this friend. My hope is I'll arrive on time this time for sure. Nope. Now I know to add 30mins to my ETA. I've been late my whole life and it's hard to change that habit. I felt bad for my one friend. He told me he arrives at the time of the meet up even though he knows I'll be late because he can't stand to be late.   Hermione was my favourite character and I hated that she ended up with Ron. Harry made a better match.   Reading was just what the girls in my family did. I wasn't an avid reader like my sister but I did read a lot. My parents would take us to the bookstore once a month. I didn't appreciate books until a few years ago. I read Divergent and the book made me angry. JK Rowling was able to build a world, characters, and sympathy in ~200 pages, something Divergent failed so miserably at in the same amount of pages. Thats when I started to appreciate good books and truly start to enjoy them.   My nephews and nieces would eat all the fruit. Then discover the candy. There is no hiding it from them. Except the top of the fridge. They're still too short to reach even with a chair. Except my uncle and cousins can reach the top of the fridge. Solution is to eat the candy as soon as you buy it.    Declare one day a year to be Pajama Day. Everyone encouraged to wear pyjamas the whole day. I'm serious about this one.   My favourite thing to do is listen to music, watch tv and go on the internet when I have the house or apartment to myself. It's the best. I can do all these things without being disturbed. I also like going to the bookstore and spending hours in there looking at books.   My hometown is completely surrounded by wild untouched land that goes on for what seems like forever. If you're going camping it's a lot of portaging, a lot of carrying packs, and a lot of paddling for hours on end. If you bring an iPhone, iPad, or iPod you better protect it! My mom dropped her iPhone in the lake one time. My dad was smarter and put it in a waterproof case. But neither of us brought any kind of chargers. After a long day of paddling/portaging in the hot sun, it's nice to relax in your tent and listen to some music, play a game, or watch a video. Then it dies and you still have a few days to reach your destination. I plan on taking my oldest nephew on our next camping trip and I'm sure as hell getting him a charger so he can play his iPad games during our downtime.   My niece was a few months old when she had whooping cough. Was a long hospital stay and you felt helpless just watching her.   Same. School is rarely cancelled and the reasons for cancellation was because the schools water pipe's froze or the power went out for the whole town. No matter how cold those school buses still showed up 8:15 to bring everyone to school.   Listen to country music. My crush liked traditional country so I started listening to it too. Crush didn't feel the same but I discovered music I actually liked and now only listen to country.   Pay off my parent's debts. Get my dad a Harley Davidson motorcycle. He's always talking about getting one some day. As for my mom, she'll get some fancy convertible car. She's always wanted one.  	21
 The ability to turn all sounds except player sounds may or may not effect UHC, probably will be fine due to the fact that all people have access to it in vanilla at any time, and it is intended, but idk.   TBH, with their rarity, it seems fine, if you get that lucky to get one of these books, or spend the time to, then its about as balanced as spawning next to a temple, not game ending, but good. Considering too the drop of books in dungeons, it seems okay.   No more endurance?    This is not the way to format posts, the correct format is MMM DD HH:MM UTC - (Title) and you must use UTC time.   test_subject5099   You sir, should just stop posting matches, this is ridiculous.

I would move to a much more convenient position to bow fight, hopefully catching the attacker off-guard and shooting him to death.   I have to thank you for that, while it wasn't directly my intent, you gave the chat a more of a wake up call then myself alone could have.   The UHCS skype chat, as I understand it, is for us to socialize, and it has been that way for a while, but or some reason lately it is filled with uninteresting, stupid guff that most people don't want to read or care about. Myself and many others have left the chat for this reason, where we were mostly there for information about the server, the occasional conversation was fine, but it had gotten out of hand.  A long time ago when the server was smaller and there were way less people, me and MG had a very long conversation about random stuff, that we were promptly told by many to stop, which we did, and talked in a private chat.  What I'm asking is to stop all this random stuff on the chat, and bring it back to its original purpose, the way it should be and was meant to be, not some role-playing chat with random topics that mean nothing to the chat. This is a plea for order, for the way things should be, not a spam-filled chat with things you can do elsewhere.   I didnt say it wasn't :P just that he said call, but calls are not permitted.   *cough* skype is not allowed *cough* only teamspeak *cough cough*   basically, teamspeak would be incredibly easier because you can just switch channels.

This is true ^^^^   ._.   No, log on at any time to play.   I wouldn't assume solos are allowed, are they?   Since this is the only activity this account has also ever had on reddit, this is almost certainly not true. Hooray for logic!   I win   Well, then allow me to go for round 3 :D   I posted this after the match was full, I posted it for people that didn't get into this match but still wanted to get in, but that's fine, I hate fun too.

 It sure did.  I mean, to see something with that much value in this world see it's demise in such a horrific way.      I bet that port tasted so good...   How old is his daughter?  I think that if the weapon you use is underage, you can't be charged as an adult.   Reminds me of Jason Bourne when he fought that guy with only a pen.   Ribbed for her murder.   I bet he said something hilarious when you did it, too.   Sometimes you feel like a nut, sometimes you don't.  Almond Joy's got nuts, Mounds has a small dosage of strychnine.

Maybe she ruptured some nerves while bending over to pick them up and effectively paralyzed herself from the neck down.  Once paralyzed, she fell to the floor, only since she's paralyzed...she couldn't catch herself and hit her head on your night stand and broke her neck.   I guess you could turn it up to 11?

I agree.  Definitely make a date more than just a movie.   1, 5, 7, 6, 2, 4, 3      If the original comes on television at any time of the day, I will watch at least 10 minutes of it.   Actually, if you go to the movie first, that gives you a subject to talk about while you're having dinner.  Whether it was a good or bad movie, you can jump start a conversation by sharing opinions about the movie.   This one time, I put two on to protect my wien...oh wait..."condiment".     Never mind.   Water boarding?   Hmmm.  Bristle end or handle end?   That sounds like a great way to go.  And now I'm hungry for a brownie.   You live by the keyboard and you die by the keyboard, I guess.

That rabbit hole is too deep.   That sounds like it came straight from the game.   I'm bored.      Not just a Supra, but a white one. I think that has some kind of imagery behind it.   Yes, I am glad that I didn't. I don't want him to worry about something that I did to myself in the past. He has his own issues to deal with and I didn't feel like burdening him with one of mine.  And what you said last is something that I find to be very true now. Last night I found out that my friend has gone through the same exact situation I'm in now...only 8 years ago. After our talk last night, I realized that we have a lot more in common than I originally thought.   I'm going through a lot of shit right now (that I don't feel like divulging at the moment). I got a text from a friend asking if I wanted to join him for some drinks at a bar tonight. I said sure and a couple of hours in, we were having serious conversations about our lives.  I came really close to telling him about how the scar on my arm was from when I felt my life was in a tailspin and the pain from cutting was the only thing that I could actually control. As soon as I got ready to say it, I chickened out. I just couldn't imagine what one of my closest friends would think about me.  I don't cut anymore, but every time I sweat while playing basketball or working out...it becomes very visible. I guess that will be with me for the rest of my life.  There's no real point to this post. I just needed to get that out.   When I maxed out my first credit card, buying stupid things that I thought I needed at the time.   When the website didn't work, I tried the Windows app...    When the Windows app didn't work, I tried the phone app...      When the phone app didn't work, I tried a homing pigeon...

The dog knows these facts. Undeterred, he stands watch, ever ready to do battle.

 Sorry in advance, OP.

Maybe OP can defend why these are 50% off and not authentic looking.   ecigclassifieds recommends crossposting to ECR to maximize the amount of people that see it.   Like,  LSD   First thing I noticed. These honestly look pretty fake. I bought the same combination for a friend. [Here's a picture of the two products together.](http://i.imgur.com/7fIhRbq.jpg)   [Here's the invoice.](http://i.imgur.com/UI9sxSN.png) The Vision Spinner from a really cheap website was $33, the Mini Protank $13. So this kit is 50% off? What's the motive for the price drop?   Plot Twist:  The vinegar was acid   I think Greece was always broke. Didn't they have trouble getting into the EU, therefore did some creative accounting, and then got caught?    Yeah, after going to sleep after taking some pills that like to cause nightmares, and after losing my big guy, I definitely have a picture similar to this but a bit more graphic still stuck in my mind. Really wish I didn't see this post.    Man, this is one of the greatest videos I've seen on reddit. Love it.    http://tinypic.com/r/5ey2k4/4   I had an older man who seriously laughed in the strangest way during every single serious moment. It was not a comedy.    Wattage is completely your preference! You'll essentially just play around with it until you find the vapor that is perfect for you.   The group buy I'm a part of:  http://www.reddit.com/r/SmogGB/comments/2t5638/istick_delays/  And an email from SmogLA, head of /r/SmogGB and smogdistribution  The istick 50w buy is delayed and at this time ETA for shipment from China is at the end of February or the beginning of March.   It's the Chinese New Year.   Yeah, I was really worried about paying through PayPal, as I just joined in on my first group buy for you. Both Amazon and PayPal do not support electronic cigarette products. Really glad to hear that it worked out.    Yep! I second everyone elses' comments here. One thing to note about the iStick 50w is that eLeaf is pushing back the release date heavily. The release date was originally today or January 26th. Then it got pushed back to February 16th. Now eLeaf is saying that they'll come out at the end of February/early March. Just a heads up. I pre-ordered and got kinda screwed with that one.   Thank you for your reply. My main concern here - what I was angry about, was that I thought LazyPancake was a moderator, and when I saw his/her comment:  You're a horrible person. You don't deserve a significant other if you can just so callously brush aside a cheating incident.  When someone makes you their world, when they love you whole-heartedly, and they put all their trust in you, it doesn't matter if you cheated once, or 100 times, you're still an awful human being. You should absolutely tell them. It's called RESPECT. If you don't have enough respect for them as a person to not fuck other people, then you need to man/woman the fuck up and tell him/her.  They always find out.  I was enraged because I couldn't believe a moderator would say shit like that in their own subreddit.   That part of my comment on here became completely void, and the fact that people were in here just totally sounding off their mouths for OP to "grow a pair" and just totally slamming him, wouldn't have been angering enough by itself to make me want to call out the moderators. I understand that shitty people are everywhere, and yeah, maybe it was like that before I joined. Maybe it was just sort of a bias I had being a new user that I was just happy to be here and didn't really see all of the hate around here, but still I feel like it's gotten worse for sure.  Back to what you were talking about, though, I'm still going to be "that guy", the ass. When it comes to people with just unhelpful harassing hate speech on here (all of /u/j-chance's initial comments), I feel like other subreddits would at the very least delete some of the real nasty things he said. You were concerned about censoring or banning becoming an abuse of power, but with something like what's coming out of this kids keyboard, I really don't think it'd be that at all. It'd really kind of be a good use of the power you have, in my mind. I'm not a moderator, I'm not going to tell you anymore about how to do your job. I appreciate your reply and I don't mean to make you miffed. The purpose of my post was to make whoever promoted LazyPancake miffed out, but turns out she moderators ECR_Plus and not this subreddit. Have a good day, man.    I've been in that same spot, friend. Went through 8 different anxiety and depression meds - not a single worked, and the side effects were life ruining. Glad it works for you!   YES! The fogger v4 is excellent, and I came here to recommend it. I got mine in early June of 2014, and it was the only atomizer I used from then until just yesterday I bought another. While it is a rebuildable tank atomizer, when my tank runs dry, I can drip through the drip tip to make it until my next refill, or to try out new Eliquids.  I give the product an 8/10. The flavor is incredible, the vapor production is excellent, and the reliability is spot on - worked for me for over a half year.   However, it takes a very long time to find the right wicking strategy - it is very hard to build. This alone is why it lost 2 points. It will take you lots of time to figure out how to stop the leaking.   I myself am a bigger fan of the second to last produced fogger v4 (they put out like 5 versions of the v4, the last produced is the fogger v4.1) with the bigger deck. The bigger deck makes it much easier to wick and build, as the closeness of the deck to the glass of the tank slows down the Eliquid as its feeding from the tank into the coils.    The MVP is a good starter, but take note that although it comes with a tank, the iClear30, the tank isn't really all that great and I wouldn't rely on it.   Also, really make sure that with the MVP that you keep the [510 connection dry] ( http://imgur.com/fb3lLK7), as Eliquid will get that rubber insulator wet and ruin it. My MVP 510 has failed and doesn't work, cause it's just not all that great.   Another downside about the MVP is that if you venture into a rebuildable atomizer, the MVP doesn't throw enough amps to power dual coils.   Other than that, the mvp is a great device. It's perfect for a beginner, and it'll power clearomizers very well. The battery life is absolutely excellent, and the fact that it has an ohms reader built into it is very very useful, even if you outgrow vaping on the device.    Some people report that nicotine helps to prevent both alzheimer's and parkinson's diseases, that it can help those with ADHD to focus, and that nicotine is actually triggering new studies to the cure/treatment of diabetes, because it helps to create new blood vessels/speed up the bodies creation of blood vessels.   You're actually very right. Sorry, that's definitely my bad. I saw that he has been posting the daily questions threads, and I could've sworn I saw his name in the long list of new mods. Why is he/she asking that people post in the daily questions thread, though, if he's not a moderator? Like, why does it exist, I guess what boggles me.    She's actually the head moderator   Fuck you for criticizing anyone in this subreddit for vaping. No one needs a reason to be here, so fuck you for assuming anyone is doing it to be cool.    Sorry to see that you're getting a lot of negative feedback here. I think you asked a good question. Companies offer discreet shipping for reasons like this. I wish maybe a moderator would handle some of the senseless vulgar fighting - none of that belongs in this subreddit, nor was it here when I joined. If you don't like a post, you have the option of down voting it and moving on.   Edit: instead of a moderator trying to help you out, one of them is in here dissing you for wanting to pick up vaping.   /u/LazyPancake  /u/Lynda73,  how did this subreddit come to this? This is supposed to be a welcoming and helpful community for both those who want to quit smoking and those who want to pick up vaping, regardless of their reasoning.   Edit^2: I guess LazyPancake isn't a mod, although he posts the daily questions threads. That changes the whole situation greatly.  Edit^3: sorry, LazyPancake, that I've made you mad. Thanks for going through my profile and down voting 45 of my posts.    Noooope. Knowing Kanger products, definitely not thinking this is a great idea.    In GTA IV, I once tried to buy a hot dog from the seller near the pier for the annihilator choppers.   The option to buy a hot dog did not come up, so naturally I point my gun at him to intimidate him. Then, something I've never seen before happened.   The hotdog seller just simply fell down, as if I had knocked him over by just pointing a gun at him. As he was slowly falling into his hotdog stand, he hit the propane tank located on his side of the stand, exploding the hotdog stand and killing us both.   In GTA IV, I once tried to buy a hot dog from a jihadist.   English is my native language and I have no clue what he said.

That usually means that the 510 isn't contacting the atomizer, or the coil isn't contacting the atomizer, not that there's a dead short in the coil, so I'm out of ideas. I don't use aspire products :(, could she have the wrong coil?   I take back everything I said - old reply deleted. Definitely drunk, didn't realize that you have the new MVP 20w and not the iStick 20w. If the MVP reads NON, there is definitely something not making contact.   Can you double check right now that if you screw in the old coil, that it does not read NON?   If it doesn't read NON, confirm that the two coils you are using are the same size and length. If they are, you have a dud coil and need to replace it with a different one.  If it does read NON, this is a known problem with the old MVPs that could've carried over into your new MVP. If all else fails, try gently prying up the center pin of the 510 connection on the MVP, [this thing here, ] ( http://imgur.com/fb3lLK7) with a paperclip. You just need to pull that pin up a little bit to contact your atomizer, then your coil should fire again.    "NON" means that it doesn't detect any metal device, not even a shorted coil. That usually happens when your atomizer does not contact the battery/device (your iStick). Make sure it's screwed on tight enough, that the metal pin in the center of the bottom of the atomizer sticks out a little bit. If it's screwed down all the way, try unscrewing it a tiny bit/wiggling it back and forth until you see a resistance. Try turning your iStick off and back on again.

Low wattages will still reach the designated temperature, but at a slower speed. Have you tried that?

The information is out there, studies are being done, we have to go out there, outside of reddit, and find the answers, because they exist.   Absolutely agree with your first point about the DNA40. This is a great accomplishment.   Where did you purchase yours from?   Kinda saw this coming, as the original release date was the 25th-26th, but then Eciggity who just added it to their website a few days back said they'd receive it around Feb 16th.   Turning out in front of me on the road (in a Prius, they always have to be first) and going under the speed limit.    Yes. Personal bad experiences, but also search this subreddit for "Eciggity black Friday"    If you dive into the court transcript the article links to, even though the article states that he was arrested for disorderly conduct for giving the cop the finger, it turns out that the giving of the finger had almost nothing to do with the arrest. It seems like the finger giving guy swore the cop up and down, and then came at him (saying he wanted to talk "Man to Man" with the officer) in a way that one side says is threatening and one side says was not, and was then arrested for disorderly conduct  Also interesting, here are the cop's reasons for pulling over the car whose passenger flipped them off:   (1) Johns gesture appeared to me he was trying to get my attention for some reason, (2) I thought that maybe there could be a problem in the car. I just wanted to assure the safety of the passengers, and (3) I was concerned for the female driver, if there was a domestic dispute. (uscourts.gov pgs 4 5)  This was in fact really ridiculed in the court report.   S'all good, man. Let me know what you go with.   People generally didn't like ribbon wire when it came out, but I don't give much of a fuck for the consensus, myself. I've used it only once when I started out, but just pulled the trigger on another reel today to give it a second shot. Check out this page over at [Temco Industries](http://www.temcoindustrialpower.com/product_selection.html?p=flat_ribbon_kanthal)  It is sized by mm.x.mm  0.4x0.1 = 32 gauge  0.5x0.1 = 31 gauge  0.6x0.1 = 30 gauge  0.7x0.1 = 29 gauge  0.8x0.1 = 28 gauge  0.9x0.1 = 27 gauge  What you want to do to find what is right for you is head over to [Steam Engine](http://www.steam-engine.org/coil.asp), under Material and Profile, select Kanthal A1 Ribbon, under Setup, select how many coils you usually rock, select your usual goal resistance, and your usual coil diameter. Then, play around with the thickness of the ribbon wire until you get an amount of wraps you like.   On my mechanical mod, I generally like about 6 wraps of 26 gauge round kanthal around a 5/64" or 1/10" diameter, amounting to 0.4 ohms, so I picked 0.8mm by 0.1mm flat ribbon wire, and I should have mine in a few days here.  Lemme know if you have any other questions.   Where did you purchase?    50w's release date has been pushed back. I don't think it will. The original release was January 25th-26th, now recent posters say early February.    Why in the hell would you recommend people down vote it?

What causes harshness in an e-liquid is the levels of propylene glycol as well as the nicotine concentration of the e-liquid. With this sort of higher powered tank, you can reduce the nicotine concentration (because you're vaporizing more liquid faster), and run higher vg liquids to smooth out the vapor.   I run about 30 from a mechanical mod and see room for more wattage. The thing about this box mod is that its output is fully customizable from 2v-10v, and 5w-50w. I recommend this over the regular eLeaf iStick, because it won't fire the Atlantis. The Atlantis' coils measure out to 0.5 ohms and the original iStick, while awesome, fires only down to 1 ohm. There is a 30w eLeaf iStick, which fires down to 0.4 ohms.

Roomate's dog just had a front leg amputated today. Thanks for the post - it made him smile as well.   Okay, that's not part of the issue, then. If you were to say Max VG or a higher VG mix, I'd point to the thickness of the e-liquid preventing wicking into the coil.   Aspire Atlantis and the eLeaf iStick 50w coming out January 26th is what I recommend to anyone new to vaping or looking for an upgrade.    It's whatever tickles your fancies, however use a higher voltage for thicker (more vg) liquids, and lower voltage for thinner (50/50 or more pg)  Eliquid.    Even if they look legit that sounds kinda sketchy. I'd try ordering from Mt. Baker Vapor, Vape Dojo, or discountvapors.    Until the FDA tries to put us all on cartomizers.    Do this! I'm getting one.    What is the pg/vg mix of the Eliquid you are using?    Where do you buy your coils from?    As you go lower in resistance the coil will reach higher heats (watts). This will throw better clouds, as well as warmer and tastier vapor, but it needs to be paired with fast wicking speed in order to prevent dry hits, because you're vaporizing more liquid faster.   Gradually drop your resistance. If you start getting dry hits galore, increase the resistance of your coils. You can also rebuild them yourself to whatever resistance you desire, if you're inclined to do so. It's easy, but you won't be able to make them dual coils - it really takes a machine to fit two coils that close in that tight of space with no shorts. I used to rebuild mine single coil all the time with cotton for increased wicking speed and noticed much better results.   If you're purchasing coils, I'd choose 1.5 over 0.8. I don't think Kanger's wicking speed will keep up.    Did it fire before the batteries read 3.44v? Did you put in fully charged batteries and they went down to 3.4 while providing no vapor? If so, did you check the resistance of your build?    I know you said you don't like big clouds and appreciate simplicity, but the newest thing out right now is the aspire Atlantis and kanger subtank. These two tanks (I don't know much about the kanger version) are made to run at warmer temperatures (which while offering bigger clouds will also offer stronger flavor) ,  similar to those of a rebuildable atomizer, while having easy replaceable coils, just like your protank.   The aspire Atlantis won't fire on your MVP (the coils measure out to 0.5ohms, mvps fire  0.7), but it will fire on something like the new eleaf istick 50w coming out on January 26th ($50), or any mechanical mod.    Is there something I'm missing in your calculation?  2.1mg/kg  70kg * 2.1mg = 147mg  147(mg) / 12(mg/ml) = 12.25ml of e-liquid  147 / 18 = 8.1666-  147 / 6 = 24.5  147 / 3 = 49   Not an ending, but a part of Gears of War Two, when Tai ended his life.    Also posted in /r/gif a month ago.  http://www.reddit.com/r/gifs/comments/2p6rje/aww_yisss_i_enjoy_that_brushing/   DAMNIT. I just got 400 grains and saw:  Sponsored banners displayed on correct answers pay for the rice donated    Hi, friend. You write beautifully.  I've lost two friends of mine to suicide, just under a year apart. One I was close to, but the more recent passing was of a friend who my relationship with is very similar to that of the friend you lost. He had moved away, we became distant, and I had no clue he was feeling the way he was until that one day when he just snapped.  A moment later, I was angry. Not at him, but at myself for not being there for him. For not being close to him as I should have. I knew a lot about him, but I never took the time to actually be with him.  It seems like some self-blame is coming up here. You wish you had been there for him. The thing to remember is that you couldn't really have predicted that he would have passed away, no one could have - even while knowing quite a bit about his harsh past. Another thing is that maybe it isn't your fault that the two of you became a bit distant - it takes two to have a friendship, maybe there were obstacles coming up in your life that you couldn't control, which prevented you from being close to him, or maybe it was him that grew distant to you. As I'm sure you know, becoming distant from society is one of the first moves those who are deeply depressed or suicidal tend to make - whether it's purposely or inadvertently. He could have isolated himself.  Another huge thing I've learned through some therapy has to do with self-blame. I didn't see this come up in your writing, but I wanted to mention it just in case. In the passing of my first friend who I was close to, I felt largely to blame, because we had promised each other that if either of us were to commit suicide, that we'd go to the other person for help first, and while he kept up his side of the deal, he went to me for help, I had pushed him away - I was fighting with my girlfriend at the exact same time, he really didn't make it clear that he was thinking about suicide, just that he was deeply depressed, and I told myself that I'd meet up with him in the morning to make up for the half-assed advice I was giving him then. I of course felt that I was to blame - that I had let him down, but the important thing to remember is that you were not the cause of his passing - he made a decision - one that no one else could make for him. In the end, it was his choice, and as horrible as it is, nothing can change that.    I wanted to forget him, I wanted to push him out of my mind and push him away. But I couldnt. Hes there.  You will come to terms with this more easily far in the future. While right now it is going to hurt every day, the pain does diminish gradually over time. It DOES get better.  While he will always have a place in your heart (and that's not a bad thing, my first friend passed in 2011 and I now smile whenever I think of him - I was lucky to have known him while I did), he doesn't necessarily have to always have a place in your mind. While he is there constantly right now, as time goes on he will be there only as long as you want him to be.  That's okay - remember that even while he left, that he wouldn't want to be a cause of pain for the people he knew. He would want you to smile when you think about him - and I think you really highlighted that well in the last paragraph.   I wasnt even close to him but he had affected me with so much distress.  This is completely normal. Don't ever feel that you don't have permission to be sad just because you had grown distant near the end. I went to a highschool with a pretty high suicide rate, and I noticed that a death manages to bring down a whole community, whether they were close to that person, once knew that person, sometimes saw that person, or even if they didn't know them at all - they will be saddened by the loss of that person. What you're feeling sucks hard, but it is natural. Also, I feel from some of the memories you shared that you were close to him in heart.  There's also quite a bit of talk of suicide throughout here - that you've attempted, wish to be gone like him, and feel very sad right now. I know everything really sucks right now, and I feel for you - that's why I'm writing. I've been in similar shoes. I feel that for almost all of my life I've been considering and sometimes attempting suicide, and a year and a few months ago, I was hospitalized as well. I just want to share with you that for such a long period of my life, I felt like there was no way out but suicide - that I was destined to go that way, but now, I absolutely love my life. Not only do I not feel suicidal, but my overall feelings/signs of depression have decreased, and my feelings of anxiety have decreased tremendously - even though less than a half a year ago I was diagnosed major depressive with some sort of severe anxiety disorder. I never thought it would be possible for me to feel this way - to look back on all the times I had attempted to take my life and be glad that I had not taken it - but it IS possible, and it IS something that can be in your future, so please don't skip out on the time that you will too feel this way. I'm off my meds, single and independent, in a stable household with a sort of foster family, I've amended my previously non-existent relationship with my parents, in college, with a job, and feeling great - and you can be too. Please hang in there through this time. It's a really shitty tunnel, but there is beautiful light at the end of it - and you don't have to reach it by taking your life.  I really hope I could help a bit. If you want to talk further about this, vent a little bit, ask questions or pick my brain, just please comment on here - I'm here for ya. Best of luck.  	104
 Thank you! I honestly never done any other shows, but I certainly can! I was really inspired to paint something from this show because I absolutely love the style of the show; the colors and cinematography! It' a really gorgeous show!    From looking at pictures of Robin for reference, I guess I just sorta picked up that little attribute!    That wasn't my intention, but I guess it is interesting how that played out, haha!    Oh... thanks, I guess.    Thank you, so much!    I don't plan on selling this particular piece, only because I want to avoid legal trouble, but I do have other pieces of art for sale here:http://society6.com/cassy_dale  Thank you so much for your interest!   	6
 Try Soul Eater   Hell yeah ! :D nice to see someone with same hobbyies.   My steamid : test_subject5926 // feel free to add me :)   Akame ga kills "Kill the newcomers" after the new guys came really caught my attention   man those fma ones, dem feels    * How the fuck do i get rid of that emptiness inside when i finish a new anime?      Thats the hardest part, best way is probably filling hole with another series    also: My first anime was Soul Eater, after i finished it i felt big hole, but then i got the manga and read it and i felt way better, yeah and watching AMV of series you just finished will also help (at least for me it does)      * Is there a way to control the "just one more episode and i'll go to bed"?      Cant answer you on that one, its 5am here and Im sitting here watching anime.      * I've spent way to much time on anime lately, so now that i'm into anime, is there a way out?      Why would you want to get out ? Its like trying to jump out of luxury train, why would you do it ?    yeah soul eater needs one hard and akame ga kill would also be nice,   it got so annoying at the end i wasnt able to finish the last episode to this day   Code Geass R2 was pretty amazing   I wouldnt risk hugging him    Invoker, Shadow fiend, Meepo   Damn i really wanted that number...  	10
 No worries, I could read it just fine. :) I think you are really on point with me not being specific about what "healthy" means. You gave me a lot to think about. Several of you have mentioned MFP and you are right. I'm going to track from now on. Great tips in your post! I'm going to start checking this sub everyday and try to be active.    This is exactly how I feel. If I make just one mistake it's just another proof of how this will never work and that I should just give up. I'm making myself a victim instead of just accepting it and keep on going. I'm going to think of this post next time it happens. Thank you and good luck to you too!    Thank you. Thing is, I already have a food scale. I have counted calories countless time, with and without myfitnesspal. I know how much/few calories I need to consume and what kinds of food I need to eat (and not eat). The problem is time. I usually last for a couple of weeks before falling back to my regular (bad) habits.   I started counting with myfitnesspal again a couple of weeks ago and then I had a few bad days. Didn't like seeing my mistakes logged so I just stopped logging. And a few bad days turned into several. I have been on a C25K program the last month but now I'm sick and I'm afraid that I won't continue with the program when I get better. I have a history with going in strong and when it gets tough or I make a mistake I just quit. It's easier than to keep trying.   I'm not interested in quick fixes or fast weight loss. I just want a better lifestyle for myself.   My strategy? Eat less, eat better, move more. Eat less = around 1400 cal should be enough, eat better = fill up on more veggies, lean protein and some fat, move more = get of the couch for walks and keep on jogging. I want to add some bodyweight training too.  Issues? I have a whole bunch of them. ;) Mostly making excuses for myself. I tried writing down some issues but they are all bad excuses. My goal is to be at a healthy weight, preferably around 65 kg (143 lbs), exercise regularly and feel strong and happy.     Both in life and on this subreddit. I'm F/172 cm (5'7)/79 kg (175). I have struggled with my weight, my selfesteem and depression all my life. I now have two little girls and I don't want to do this any more. My mother have been on a diet her entire life and still is. I want to show my girls what it's like to love yourself and take care of your body. To do that I need to do it for myself first.   But this is where anxiety kicks in. I have failed all my previous attempts. Now I am at my heaviest (except during pregnancies). In a couple of months I will be 30 years old. I'm entering my thirties weak, fat and scared. How is this time any different? Will this just end in another failure? I'm already preparing myself for my next failure and I don't think that is going to help me.   I have decided to stop being a lurker and start being active. Maybe this community is what I need to stop being afraid of life. Maybe this is the thing that will finally put an end to the anxiety and pain. Maybe this will help make it fun.     I would really appreciate stories from those of you who have been where I am and who managed to turn their life around. Or maybe just tell me something that helped you making that change. Thank you for reading and if you're a part of this community then you're already a great inspiration!      Edit: Thank you! I'm overwhelmed by all the supporting and inspiring replies. I woke up today feeling like this will actually work! I'm going to start logging my food in MFP. My username is Anthliel of you want to add me. I log most of my food in swedish but I'm going to try to log in english when possible.    Great post! I really needed to read this today.   	5
 I absolutely agree, and I definitely will be out and about during this trip. However, I'm a very techy person so anything with lights and sounds amuses me extremely while tripping aha   YouTube vids, music videos, games, movies, short stories, etc.  I like mind fucks and deep stories and all that stuff, but I'm open to anything. Especially serious/dark stuff!   This also tripped me out, especially the mirrors!   Totally normal. You may find that anything you drink or eat will be masked with the taste while tripping, also.   I don't think it's that simple.  There will always be slang. There's slang for marijuana and look how close to legalization that is. Whether you think it's wrong or not, I'll call it whatever the hell I want. Lucy is a slang term and its used right in the fuckin' sidebar. Preach to someone who gives a shit, lad.   When I start talking to politicians and scientists, I'll get a little more serious. Right now I'm only on the internet. Nobody important gives a shit about this subreddit or it's LSD activists.   Absolutely love it. Didn't think there'd be too many people here who knew of the band   It was my desktop background and phone background for ages! Love it so much   Hell yeah! Haha For anyone who's curious;  The band is Barrier. The album is called "Eventide". It's a trippy, Metalcore, concept album. Cool stuff.      It's shitty. I went to take a walk for like two hours just because it was killing me and now I'm back in my room. I just can't fall asleep, I just want to fast forward to when we can try again. I'm so upset with myself.   My group of friends has a couple virgins and we're all pretty normal young adults. You just need the right friends, mature friends   Okay, but I'm going to watch it sober first haha I've seen Devil's Rejects but have slacked on this movie!   Yeah, it could turn out to be silly. That whole "I see the man behind the curtain" effect hits me a lot while tripping   Cartoons while tripping are always interesting, I might try this. What's it about?   See, I love horror, but I love letting myself become absorbed the the world the movie is showing me. So I basically let myself believe what's happening on the screen to enjoy it more. This is what I'd be worried about while tripping   It's funny because this is pretty much me during playtime with these characters. I feel like there wasn't enough testing in this side of the game, I don't know. Just my opinion. It's somewhat difficult to control them fluently. I mean, I can lure enemies fine and pussy-foot through a scene but I want it to look cool! It's not easy to look cool with these guys unless by luck. But maybe that's just me.   I remember waking up and the first thing I read from PC Gamer was "GTA V on PC delayed again..."  A heavy and emotional sigh ensued.  	18
    This pretty much sums up my entire life. At least I have reddit, where I know everyone hates everyone!     	3
 add sci-fi stuff to swords axes and other old weapons i thought mini thruster behind the blade to propel it and a retractable chain mechanism on the handle to the wrist of the user in case it's dropped  without going into the most seen things such as laser blades and such. i don't care if they wouldn't be used because blah blah guns blah    that's a very low power abilty more fit to be a trait of your character think weirder and bigger.   Outcome: "You're knocked over, your action is interrupted and your face smarts." This anime-inspired gift is a nigh-unblockable technique to inflict mild pain upon ones opponent and interrupt whatever mundane action they're performing at the time. At One-trick Utility, this particular version can activate only in response to an offense to the user (insult or attack to user or people they care about). Given that, however, the user is free to describe different methods of attack (slap, giant hammer, high kick, high-velocity football, etc) that all do the same thing.  If a Noble with this Gift messes up or does something really embarrassing, then it erases the memories of everyone who saw him foul up. It won't actually undo any of the physical consequences of his mistake, but it'll make sure no one rubs it in his face. Note that because this Gift is limited to local range, it won't help if the Noble's screw-up is somehow broadcast to other people, like over television or radio.  A Noble with the Seven League Step can cross extremely long distances in a matter of seconds! Each use of this Gift lets him cover about ten miles of distance as he runs as superhumanly fast speeds. This is way faster than the speed of sound, so this might cause a sonic boom if you're in a place where stuff like that happens.  This Gift, designed for the Power sworn not to kill, causes their actions never to kill anybody, no matter what. In fact, it becomes more or less impossible for anyone in the Power's presence to die other than of natural causes, unless a miracle is used with the specific intent to kill. Otherwise, regardless of the level of collateral damage, everybody lands safely in a dumpster, or is shot in the arm, or can be thawed out later with no lasting effects.  If you want the mechanical rules i can also post that.   Traveller i hear is pretty complex and yet it's one of the most beloved games.   to put it simply the players play as incarnation of reality , a piece of it, whatever the players want they can have as their estate ,fire,libraries,lakes,cats with green eyes, that feeling when you heard a sound while listening to music, etc  and to that comes the fun for the gm, atleast for me, it seems it's one of the few games where the Gm is actually playing and not just being an engine so the others have fun, more on that in a bit.  the players are a family bound by the same imperator and reside in the chancel their duty is to protect their aspect of reality and the chancel and nothing else, atleast it should be that way but Nobles (the beings you play) are most emotional beings and have their drives so that means feuding in some cases (which can be great fun, stealing Fate's collection of profecyzing toad pets and use them to predict what good shows are coming on tv in the future and which one suck)  Nobles are very hard to kill, straight up combat between nobles is frowned upon and seen as barbaric, backstabbing and other less flashy kind of attacks are prefered, keep in mind Nobles are EXTREMELY hard to kill, it CAN be done but you have to REALLY want to kill that dude (if he's mortal, immortality is a measly 6 poins) by ye old way of kicking but, be smart and use your estate and less "direct" ways (Such as Domain and Person) to inflict damage  ruin their name, destroy things that belong to their estates, The Noble of Oceans would be greatly weakened if somone happened to drink the mediterranean (aspect 8 miracle)     Oh please yes Nobilis is my favorite game it's just unique.   Gurps is what comes to mind if we're talking about complex but playable if you want so complex that it's like calculus in college level of complex the unholy trinity has something for you.   Nobilis is a diceless system where you play an incarnation of piece of reality ranging from Thunder,Lakes,Sight to cats-that-have-green-eyes. and have total control over it.  "Gifts are the "skills" in Nobilis. They work pretty much like miracles with one exception. Miracles are flexible and mutable. They can adapt to any situation as deemed so. Gifts cannot.  A gift is "purchased" at character creation and it can be used by a character any time they deem necessary without any need to expend Miracle Points. A single gift can do anything, from a single task to several of them separately, only imagination and the HGs judgment limits it's creation."  show me your creativity.   I recently got the realm reborn ost but alot of tracks have come out since then, anyone know where i can get the new ones?   i don't understand the math or reason behind both.  	10
 It may be worth considering that you have absolutely no idea what you are talking about.   So because you don't know a word I can't use it? The word existed long before I used it.   Do you have a question?   Is there a question?   My wife stacks her pills and doesn't deal with that    It's rarely relevant. Most people don't even know what it is and my preferred pronouns are obvious from my appearance, so there is no need to express such.    Not really a problem, but I appreciate your drunken concern.   Sorry, I was out car shopping.  I would say that in the sense that I experience dysphoric feelings, it's a disorder, though in the sense that something is "wrong" with me, I wouldn't. I learned in psychology in college that to be considered a mental illness, it has to cause negativity in your life. If you hear voices but they are encouraging and good, you're not mentally ill, despite the fact that it may be inconvenient. Based on that, while the dysphoric feelings suck, they don't in any way hinder my life, so no, I'm not experiencing a mental disorder or illness.  I don't know the cause. My "brain map" of my body isn't correct to what my body actually is. That seems like it's either psychological or body related. I don't much care how I'm perceived but I present more masculine, so that is a societal or environmental factor.   I began identifying as genderqueer at around 14 or 15. I'm 20 now. I had a friend who came out as a transman and was doing research when I fell upon the term and it fit like a glove. I have memories from childhood that I call "signs I was trans". I can remember being 7 trying to make a prosthetic penis to pee through with a toilet paper roll. I can remember being about 9 and seeing an episode of SVU about transpeople and crying because I assumed by parents did that to me as a baby and couldn't just love me as the boy I was born as. I can remember praying for my period at 12 because I thought I would actually feel like a girl when I got it and it would prove that I was born one and was supposed to be one.    Yes, I have depression and anxiety. However, that has nothing to do with my gender identity. I have no other diagnosis so I won't claim any other.    http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genderqueer  http://gender.wikia.com/wiki/Transmasculine   Yes and no. One can simply identify as genderqueer, which is something of an umbrella term, and not wish to make any changes. I don't identify as 100% man 100% of the time, so I feel transman isn't fitting, but genderqueer is, however I am actually making an effort to transition just toward what exactly isn't quite defined.   Edit: I'm the only female child in my family so female pronouns. I don't want to hurt my parents.   I read through his filmography on Wikipedia to answer your question, and, while I recognized many titles, I've never seen any. I don't really like movies, though.   It means that, while I don't wish to fully transition to being a man 100% of the time, I do wish to transition to being more masculine. The difference between this and simply being masculine is that I make changes, like binding my chest, to do so. I also will have my breasts removed eventually.    I think people should do whatever they want, provided it harms no one else. For me, I like having a label that I feel fits me.   I've never seen anything with Bill Murray in it.       None of those subs are all that specific. Twox is only specifically about women and politics is only specifically about politics, based on name alone. /r/dicksprinkles is specific but not biased.   Got mine free on Facebook. The people were moving and needed to get rid of it, my wife and I wanted to upgrade from our full to a queen. It sits on a platform my dad and I built together and it's wonderful.   Consider adoption, if you and your wife can love an adopted baby the same way as a biological one. No shame if you can't, though, adoption isn't for everyone. My older brothers are both adopted since my parents "couldn't have kids" and they they had my younger brother and I biologically. It's great and I'm far closer to my adopted brother than my biological one.   I got one pair in 9th grade. They fell apart in less than six months.    You didn't bang a first time and objectification of OP isn't the way to get there anyway.   XI is 11. VI is 6. Just for future reference.    Wow... abusive much? Do you know anyone with PCOS and how there are various levels of seriousness of it and symptoms?    Go to church, pray in school, read the bible, etc.   Far the hell away from?   That's a line to get more than a handjob.    My mom got fired from selling Tupper Ware in the 80s because she got diagnosed with cancer and didn't have a party for three weeks. It was bullshit.   Mine has helped me a lot. He doesn't do anything questionable, either. He willingly sends people to orthopedic surgeons when needed. He performs x-rays and I have heard him tell people he can't help them. Most of my program included exercising the injured site, starting with passive stretching by a licensed massage therapist and then with help from a licensed personal trainer. He explains immediately in your first visit that he is not a medical doctor and if that makes you uncomfortable you are free to go elsewhere. My wife has PCOS and I speculated so for about six months. He met her once when she came with me and the next appointment he told me he thought she had it and that she needed to see a gynecological doctor immediately. He was right, obviously, and never tried to make me bring her for adjustments to help her. He stated that she needed hormonal treatment most likely in the form of birth control, which is right. I appreciate mine so much. He has been such a help in my life.   You went to a quack, that doesn't make all chiropractors quacks. Mine is great. He helped me with injuries from a car accident and has never pushed the herbal remedies he sells on me, just helps me with my back, as he is employed to do.    The point is that I disagree with something for my own arbitrary reasons. That doesn't mean I have to think other people can't do that thing.  Edit: the porn of little people I have seen looks like children and that freaks me out, if that's what you were asking.   I think that watching midget porn is gross and creepily close to childporn and wrong but others have the choice to do so.   But the pharmaceutical companies want their money and will do anything to harm you and your family to get it!!!!!!!!!   Uhm no. I'm a woman married to a woman. I am high libido, she is low. Marriage has nothing to do with money; it's about love and commitment. I don't make any money as I'm unemployed at the moment and I want more sex. You are so wrong.   That's what I meant; hippies and wiccans alike are counter culture with strong, far from mainstream beliefs. As a recently former teenage girl, they (we?) Get a bad rep for insisting they are something they know nothing about, but that's just teens in general.    WHO NEEDS A HOUSE OUT IN HACKENSACK?   Wiccans get a bad rep because they are like the equivalent of hippies, and teenage girls think they are Wiccan.    Honestly, in schools. World Religions is required in a lot of places. When I learned it in sixth grade, we learned of the Abrahamic religions (and a bunch of others) but not how they were connected; my mom explained it. It would help cure a lot of hatred.   A poor people rock where geography isn't a priority.   Dude. I get you mean to be sweet, but you are sort of treating OP like a commodity. Good effort, bad approach.    I have a fear to the point of a full blown phobia. I will probably have nightmares from these pictures tonight and I can't even go near a snake if I have a lawn mower. I am petrified of them. Though, I am working on it with subs like that one.   How many people do you live with.   Heiney?   Snakes terrify me. But I totally agree. I love the way that community fawns over their little guys and girls the same way I do my buns. It takes some of the terror out.   Touch.    I also got married. At 20. My wife would have had to drop out so we got hitched. Still very happy about that decision.       Well there are. Guys can even do it missionary. It's not that complex.   Probably all the aftermath of the last episode. The wreckage of their lives. Jesus either dead or in boarding school, and coping with that change. Ana either dead or fighting to keep her baby. Marianna dealing with her brother gone and possibly her bio mom and/or sister. Responsibility for the accident and what about Brandon's car? The kiss with Monte and Lena and if that wrecks the marriage of Stef and Lena, which I doubt it will. Just my predictions.    You two look great.   When it comes up 3 years in a seemingly life long relationship it's childish. He has strung OP along for three years.      Iam*Judger*AMA   I agree. Obviously if your health and safety depend on it, then it's fine, but being stealth is being a closet case and being a closet case helps no one. Don't expect others to stand for your rights if you won't stand for them.    "Hunk" and "Future Model" type shirts don't get to me. At that point, babies don't have much to offer but their looks. Nothing wrong with saying they're beautiful, male or female. Now, by 6 months when they are actually doing things, it's about accomplishments.    I'd like you to join us over at The Gay Agenda ^^^tm. Just look us up in the rainbow pages.   I thought bikers stole chaps from Cowboys and leprechauns stole rainbows from Noah/God and "normies" stole marriage from religion? It's almost like cultural shifts occur.   I thought this was /ftm and I was like "Honey... you're beautiful but you REALLY look like a girl." Then I realized that was exactly what you were going for you you're still beautiful and still look like a girl.   Or just learn to tuck.   11 year old me would have totally wanted 11 year old you. Then we both would grow up to be gay.   It's cool. I'm 20 and Harry Styles is the only man for me. Love me some 1D.   Dude no. My mom still won't "let" me have black hair in my face and I'm still pissed I couldn't be emo in middle/high school. Own that shit.   Beetlejuice is great! It's a dark comedy and a family story.    There's four of us. My mother in law is EXACTLY like Mother Gothel. My wife and I love it for that reason.    You loved her, and at some point only wanted the best for her. Continue that. Wish her happiness. And you will find it, too.    I'd have yelled at you too. The fuck is wrong with you thinking you should be a woman at 8?   Yes   I'm the person who's car got stolen. I was hit on Thursday two weeks ago. The adjuster ignored calls and didn't inform me that he was taking my car. I hadn't even agreed to the amount he offered. I showed up today to have my car cleaned out to learn he towed it an hour away with all of my stuff in it.   Posting for a friend.  Today, I finally got around to dealing with an accident that happened two weeks ago. I work for a company that rhymes with smationsmide. They haven't sent the title because I've been avoiding their calls and so today I got them good. I stole their car and didn't tell them and shipped it an hour away with all of their stuff in it. They have no money, no car, and none of their stuff now and I got them good!   Walmart as a corporation has phenomenal equality provisions. The do not discriminate at all. Specifically the store by me, there are employees of every race; employees that don't speak English, deaf employees, those with cerebral palsy or chromosomal defects, LGBT employees and more.   My mom worked at Walmart for 14 years and was exposed to the ins and outs. A specific store may have problems with this, but as a corporation Walmart isn't as bad as people try to say.   Mostly, yeah, if you never wake up you die.   As a Pennsylvanian with friends from New England, this war happens every time we play Monopoly but I know I'm right so it's okay.    It also sort of glorifies cutting in Specials. My mom was nervous about me reading that at 12/13.   On Scott Westerfeld's website there was talk of a TV series. I think that would kill it though.   You mean the post-apocalyptic series that is far better than The Hunger Games and Divergent but isn't a movie yet?   20/F/PA.  U?   /u/TrollaBot test_subject6752   We waited until exactly two days after I turned 20 because we didn't want to be another "teen marriage" statistic lol.    Did you just change your diet or add exercise?   I got married in December at age 20. My wife and I have been together four and a half years. I don't think it's always too soon or too young.      I'm genderqueer afab. I like porn in that realm because I would like to *be* the pre/non op transwoman. I want to have my dick sucked and my boobs played with. Though, I rarely consume such porn because it's so transphobic and it makes me feel guilty.   It's the kind of tree you get golf tees from.   Yeah. That's pretty homophobic. Why are you here if you're just going to make lesbian jokes?   It's sexist because it's impossible the description only fits girls. And the opposite can not only fit men.   I'm thinking (and hoping) that he/she is suggesting that people properly train before using firearms because in his/her experience that isn't the case and it can be incredibly dangerous.  FTFY    Oh. Wow I feel like a dick. Whenever I post a screen cap I get shit for my phone font. I have a galaxy s4 and the font is called Choco Cooky.    My preference.    With the proper training and licenses, But lets not make this standard. Some of the people I have known shouldn't be allowed anywhere near a gun.     Why be sexist?    1. Lemon juice had citric acid, which is awful for you. Look for it in ingredients when shopping.  2. Huge granulated sugar is not good. Chemical exfoliation is better for you.   I'm sure there are others but that's what jumped out at me.  Edit: apparently I'm wrong. Live and learn.   "Natural" people scare me. They are generally intelligent enough to research and learn but they believe blatantly biased sources.    She probably would have been better off getting sunburn and taking a brillo pad to it. At least then she'd be admitted and they would take away the lemons and sugar.   An extra two dollars a box for someone to write the word on it.       Victoria's?   Smirnoff Ice tastes exactly like Jolly Ranchers.   Ibuprofen doesn't have a diuretic or antihistamine, both of which help clear up mucus and make things flow a bit better.   I could say it ain't so but darlin, what's the use?  The darker the chocolate yhe richer the taste  Now if that's where it's at then run and tell that!   I didn't know the soundtrack to Hairspray was considered rap.   I'm gonna kill you!  (You're welcome)      And he can take it whenever he wants no questions asked and transport whoever he wants and whatever he wants. I'm sure he is also free to repaint it chartreuse and add orange flames. Since the car is his and all.   He lives there. That doesn't make it his. If he drives your car it's not suddenly his.   No, it isn't. She doesn't pay the rent/mortgage or the bills. She isn't responsible for her or anyone else's wellbeing.    You mean if she had "done the decent thing" and not had sex in her father's house this wouldn't have happened?   No, a guy calling someone a predator for being in his own house when his child was having sex is a weirdo.   In HIS house. She is 16, it's his house and he is free to stay. He wasn't in the room or anything. I hope you don't have children because you seem like an absolute weirdo.   Lesbian here; I prefer my wife and I to use different stuff. I like when she smells different than me.   This is sort of... wrong... buuuut I'll bite. Subarus are lesbian cars.   She reddited too. That's pretty sad...   No. He's teasing his kid.   20 year old lesbian here. Outright tell her. Tell her gay, straight, doesn't matter to you. Tell her you love her unconditionally.    Oh god I just realized how horrifying it is that I reddited a ton the night of my wedding.   Pizza makes me break out :(   But I eat it anyway so I guess I'm more of a skincare social user.      Oh snap. This is why I shouldn't comment before I'm actually awake.   Mine hasn't been coming but last month my mom was diagnosed with non alcohol related cirrhosis. When she told me it came.   My period has been super irregular for the last year and a balf. Last week, it decided only after 22 days since the previous one, that it was coming. I woke up with a brand new sheet destroyed and apparently my sleep self was unhappy with the moisture because I had ripped the sheet up and *tucked it into my crotch*. I had been sleeping naked.    I'm transmasculine/genderqueer and currently identify as a lesbian. I'm married to a beautiful woman who, despite being 100% certain that she is gay, completely supports me and recognizes that top surgery is an inevitability and is fine with that. I know I will probably transition one day, if I can be sure it means not losing my family, but I know my wife will continue to identify as a lesbian and that is fine by me. Other transguys I know have dated girls that identify as lesbians and I have seen some relationships go from lesbian to straight.   Have any of you guys had relationships like this? Would any of you begin a relationship with a woman who identified as a lesbian? I'm not looking for validation; I'm trying to start a conversation.   As many fuck ups, this happened roughly 10 years ago. I was about 10 and needed to poop. It was midsummer and, living in the Poconos (Northeast Pennsylvania) it was quite hot out. At this time, there was no air conditioning in our house, so windows were all open. Knowing this was going to be a long poop, I decided to find a means of entertaining myself.   The previous Christmas, my Grammy had gotten me and my brother a kid size accordian to share. We had barely touched it. I figured this was as good a time as any, so I made sure it would make sound, and headed to the bathroom.  I sat down and began trying different notes. I've always been pretty good with music; singing in church since age 3, clarinet since 8, so I could recognize notes by sound pretty easily. I figured out the beginning of the song and played it a few times while trying to figure out the next part.  It was going spectacularly and I was so excited to be able to share my learnings with my family. I went down stairs after I was done, and went out on the front porch to tell my parents the news.  I was greeted by my parents, brother, and several neighbors singing the song to me and then asked how my trip to the bathroom went.   TL;DR London Bridge was falling down and embarrassment was falling up.      We have been married for three months, together four and a half years. Before we got married, sex was roughly weekly. On our wedding night, she fell asleep in the middle of it. We had sex several times the first week and then it plummeted. I don't think we had sex at all I'm February and have once this month, where it was all me touching her and I barely got kissed. She offers to take care of me but I'm not even allowed to touch her breasts. I want to make love to my wife. I constantly feel rejected and unattractive. I love her and want to be with her but I hate feeling like this.   For almost a year, I have been paying for the unlimited card with bring your own phone. My phone is a red LG phone with a slide out keyboard. It's not a smart phone. When I had AT T the Internet use was disabled because it wasn't a part of the plan and we didn't want any upcharges. I don't know how to turn it back on and it's really inconvenient because I can't get picture messages. How can I turn it back on? If this isn't the right place I'm sorry but I didn't know where else to look.         My wife and I have recently realized that a large majority of lesbian sex media is centered around small, athletic bodies. Obviously not all lesbians are small, athletic people. What are your choice ways of making love to your lady, if one or both of you don't fit that stereotype?   I live in a semi-rural area. Girls get pregnant way too young here all the time. It's not Bible Belt area though, so it's not really a big deal to most people. It's a big deal to me, though. I'm going to college so I can one day support my family doing something that I love and am passionate about. I'm married to my partner, whom I've been with for four and a half years. All I want is a baby, but we can't have one because we are only 20 with no real way to afford one. Her sister, who is 18, is due in April and is getting everything handed to her for it. When we were 200 dollars short on rent because my job didn't pay me, they told us they knew this would happen and we were stupid to move out. But here we are, working hard at our goals, not having the one thing I really want, and it doesn't seem to do any good! We had no transportation for the last six weeks so we are yet another semester behind due to having to withdraw. We moved back in with my parents to save up toward our goals, but it doesn't matter because all of our money goes to household stuff anyway! I feel like I will never be able to have a family, which is all that I want. I know it's not a good time, and I know that we can't afford it and don't have enough room for a baby, but it's the only thing I want and it sucks that I feel punished for doing what's right.   TL;DR: I want a child and can't have one because I can't afford it, but other people get to screw up and have just that.   I'm just so disappointed. I live about 80 miles from the city and have all my life, and last year was my first time there at all and at a pride event bigger than four stands in a park. I feel so bad for her, but it really sucks we don't get to march.   (Posted for my brother's girlfriend) So my boyfriend and I decided to take my three dogs to PetSmart to get them new stuff. While he was doing something in the car, I loaded the three of them into a shopping cart together. It was cold and I was tired of waiting for him, so I set off toward the store. I was a bit annoyed that he was taking so long, so, when he began yelling my name as I walked into the store with my cart load of dogs, I ignored him. This was where I fucked up. I turned around to see him yelling and continued into the store. That's when I saw the phones and people dressed in blue and yellow. I brought a cart full of dogs into Best Buy, the store next to PetSmart.  TL;DR: my boyfriend tried so save me from bringing my three dogs into Best Buy and failed.   I have no idea when the last time I posted in this sub was but I was banned several days ago. Mods will not answer me, so I tried to ask on the ask sub, and I am banned there, too. I asked in modmail there, and all I got was a message that if I continue to message modmail, I'll be reported for modmail disruption. I responded that I needed an answer and I'm more than willing to stop messaging modmail when I get one. No response after that. I wouldn't care but it's the sub about a view I hold very strongly and I don't understand how I could be banned. It's really unfair and I just want to know why it happened.   My friend wants to get one next week. He's looking for black skin tone, stp and sex capable. He wants it circumcised and durable. Any recommendations of products you guys have used and liked?         He is painting it black and gray, from yellow, which my mom picked out 30 years ago. I'm not contesting that it needed paint long ago, but he is making it awful. He didn't bother to tape the ceiling, which he doesn't plan to paint, the trim is hideous with both black and gray on it because he taped it poorly and it just looks awful. He painted cabinets multiple colors and poorly at that without asking first. He has stuff all over and is taking a very long time to finish. Each night, and whenever he isn't painting, he puts his painting supplies in the bathtub so no one can bathe. You have to go through the kitchen to turn the heat on, and we live in the north east. My mom has a ton of medical problems and needs to have access to food, heat, and the bathroom. She doesn't want to say anything because she is grateful he is trying to help, but he is really causing problems.  TL;DR: my brother is trying to help but is making a bigger problem.   I know you have to be clean for something like a year, but wouldn't it make more sense to put nonalcoholics ahead on the list since they didn't make themselves sick? I'm not asking for a change my view, I just want to know why they qualify for it.      She is my best friend and my mom. She's wonderful. She was a foster and adoptive and biological mother and she took in my now wife when we were 17 and her mother through her out. She's my hero. And today she was diagnosed with non-alcohol related cirrhosis. She actually actively decided not to be an alcoholic as her father was one. Please, just pray for her. I'm so destroyed right now. I'm only 20. I'm not ready for this at all.         DAE too cool for Super Bowl?  DAE atheist?  DAE not care about -insert big/popular thing-  	136
 Exactly. It's damned if you do, damned if you don't. Regardless of how you look apparently your eating habits are everybody else's business. I don't get it.   I love that video. It's amazing how many people don't get the fact that doing shit like that is offensive until you do it to them.   Because asexual people never ever have relationships with anyone ever. /s   But there is a difference between finding humor in something you do yourself and someone else making fun of you for having a bodily function that requires ovaries. It's about context. To put it another way, in The Michael J. Fox Show, MJF makes several jokes about his own experiences with Parkinson's, and they are pretty funny. Using humor as a coping mechanism is totally valid, and often hilarious. But if someone else randomly came up to him and said something like "Look at that guy! He keeps twitching like a weirdo, what a cripple! LOLOLOL" you probably wouldn't think this person was funny, you'd call them an asshole. It's not so much the fact that the guy in my story was mentioning periods in a joke that bothered me, but the fact that he was doing it in an incredibly insensitive way.   Alright. I'll have to adjust my design then, to make sure there is enough fabric left over to wrap around the rods on either end. Thanks!   I recently took up cross stitch, and I plan on making a rather large video game-themed project soon. Rather than frame the completed cross stitch (as per usual with these sorts of things) I would like to make it into a wall scroll. I was wondering if it would be feasible to get some wooden rods and cut them in half, then tuck the fabric inside and glue them back together. Alternatively, I could always just wrap the fabric around the rods and sew it, but I don't know if it will look as neat or be as durable.  What do you guys think? I have rather limited experience with gluing wood, none when it involves fabric. What would be the best way to go about this project?   Actually, I would argue that the motion control feature is only marketable if it is mandatory for the console. If you look at the long history of motion control (it goes all the way back to the Atari), it's never done well before the Wii came along. Why? Because motion control was seen as a luxury, an optional accessory. Not that many people are willing to pay the extra money for something like that. This is reinforced by the Kinect and PS motion controls that came out after the Wii. They didn't sell as well, even though the Wii proved that there was a market for motion control, because they were optional accessories that (for most people) didn't add enough to their overall gaming experience with those consoles to be worth the extra money.    Honestly I haven't seen the movie, but from what I've been told by people who have it was meant to be seen as ridiculous in the movie. But most of the people who quote it to me in real life are taking it out of context and basically are just using it as a straight-up "LOL GIRLZ HAVE PERIODS LOL PMS LOL" kind of thing.   Yes, humor is subjective. But making period jokes is still sexist bullshit. Laughing at women because they menstruate might be "funny" to some people but that doesn't make them less of a douche.   In my head-voice I was reading in they were screeching. But to be fair that is merely my imagination and not necessarily an accurate description.   I would say no, loving problematic things isn't inherently bad, especially if you are aware of their problematic aspects. Media is made by human beings, and human beings aren't perfect, and often our media reflects the imperfections in our society. But if you had to entirely forgo ANYTHING that had problematic aspects to it, you wouldn't be able to enjoy like 99% of things.  For instance, I love to play video games. I own something like 30 PS3 games, for example. And if I separated them into stacks based on if they had problematic aspects, were neutral, or were really positive for oppressed peoples, those stacks would go from "pretty large" to "we've got a handful here" to "one or two, maybe?"  Does this mean I shouldn't play video games? Of course not. For one thing, you can't criticize something fully until you've actually experienced it. I couldn't very well say that video games are sexist if I never played video games. Also, the more and more women play games and get involved in their development, the more that culture of sexism (and other issues like racism, homophobia, etc.) changes.  So yeah, you can totally enjoy problematic media. Because life isn't about black and white, you absolutely hate it or absolutely love it kind of feelings. It's about ranges and complexity. Of course you're allowed to like movies or tv shows or games that are pretty sexist, but isn't it also true that you get super excited by a movie or show or game that is incredibly positive? For example, I really like Lord of the Rings and I've seen both the Hobbit movies so far. I recognize all the wonderful work that Tolkien put into the series, as well as the efforts of the actors and director and all the production staff for the movies. But when I got into Game of Thrones/A Song of Ice and Fire, that became my new favorite medieval fantasy series. Why? Because unlike LotR, GoT acknowledges things like sexism, ableism, and other societal problems and actually gives a pretty diverse range of characters and perspectives.  So don't feel like you're a bad woman or feminist for liking Casablanca. Just as long as you know that it has problems and you're willing to work for a future where we have better media to choose from.   No problem :    Exactly. The doctor clearly made a mistake, but I fail to see how this is somehow because of some huge trans invasion or some other bull.  Not to mention that trans people constantly have issues with doctors not wanting to recognize their identity - I imagine that most transmen have times where doctors assume they must be a butch lesbian because they wear men's clothes. The butch woman being mistaken for a transman would be the other side of that coin, I suppose. Either way it's still wrong, but there is no need to go around screeching about how trans people and lesbians who date trans women are ruining the butch lesbian identity. :/   Ugh. More trans-exclusionary vitriol.  I totally understand why this woman and her friend that the post was about would be angry that the friend in question was assumed to be trans whenever she was a butch lesbian. That is definitely wrong, and the doctor clearly made a mistake which I believe anyone would be offended about.  However, to read her follow-up response and all of the comments about how trans people are somehow a huge threat to butch lesbian existence ... it honestly made me really sad. Drawing arbitrary gender lines based on physical traits is not going to help us topple the patriarchy. People should be allowed to be who they want to be, regardless of their sexual identity, gender identity, or gender performance. Demonizing trans people only creates more problems for everyone.   Probably super random, but it really irks me whenever people quote that Anchorman line about how bears can smell menstruation. Pretty much every time this has happened near me it was some douchebro who thought it was just hilarious that he's making a period joke. The most recent time it happened I actually called the guy on it. He did the quote, a few other guys nearby gave a half-hearted chuckle, and I just straight-faced said to him, "That's not funny."  He tried to make some excuse about how humor is subjective and just because I didn't like the joke didn't mean it wasn't funny. I wasn't about to take that, so I replied "When have you EVER known a woman to laugh at that joke?" That shut him up pretty quick.   Good! I hope everything goes well with you, too :D   Sounds like you're asexual to me. Being in a relationship with someone or occasionally having sex doesn't disqualify you or anything. And honestly, a lot of queer people have issues with depression/bipolar/anxiety, doesn't make you any less queer.   I think it is definitely possible, although it depends on the relationship and what you and your partner do to make it work. My SO and I started dating when we were both 16, and we didn't have sex until we were college freshman at 18. We still have sex fairly regularly, although probably not as often as other couples. I'm pretty neutral toward sex, so I don't mind doing it with him because I see it as just another activity we do as a couple, like going on a dinner date. I enjoy it because I'm doing something with him, although obviously since I'm asexual I don't really get much out of it physically. But we're also in an open relationship so he is able to fulfill his sexual needs with other people as well.  I think the key thing to having a lasting relationship as an adult is that you and your partner communicate openly and frequently and have a lot of trust and understanding for each other. Considering the fact that asexual people are a pretty small minority compared to sexual people, it might be hard to find a partner who is willing to have the sort of relationship you're describing, and even then it will be tough to keep the relationship going. I would suggest talking to your boyfriend about it and seeing what he thinks. Honestly, it's not unrealistic to expect that the person you love will want to make you happy, so I doubt that (assuming he is a decent guy) he will ever want to force you to do anything you don't want to do.  So to answer your question, the future holds a lot of possibilities. It largely depends on you and your partner, but what you want certainly isn't impossible to achieve.   Wow, that's so awesome! I'm glad that everyone at your work seems to be cool with it all, and that your mom is supporting you too! I hope things go well with your life from now on, and good luck! :   Well obviously if there weren't any out trans people education and awareness would be an issue. However, it is the individual's choice as to whether or not they want to be out. A lot of people go stealth after transitioning because they want people to just consider them the gender that they identify as rather than having "become" that gender or thinking they "aren't actually a man/woman".   I think it would be better if we made it safe for trans people to exist first. If there were no horrible consequences for telling someone about your identity then I could understand the resentment over hiding it. But until that point, trans people are still stuck between a rock and a hard place - be forced to hide your identity or face severe, lasting consequences for being out.   If I were you I would have said pretty much the same thing.  I hate when people try to frame the discussion about trans people coming out around this idea that it's somehow cis people's right to know exactly what kind of genitals everyone has and if you think that should be private information you're some kind of deceitful asshole. You aren't doing anything wrong by existing as a trans person - if someone pursues you mistaking your gender that's their mistake, and it's really not that big a deal. Hell, if they might even find that they aren't as straight as they think they are. How is that a bad thing?   Ugh. This is why I don't come out to doctors.   The problem with this, however, is that being trans puts you in a near-constant state of anxiety and danger. There have been so many cases of trans people getting brutally beaten or murdered because they were outed. When a trans person doesn't tell people they're trans, it's not because it might be a "deal-breaker" for some people, they're doing it for survival.   It's not really a "may be" at this point, it's fact. The number of states and countries that have legalized marriage equality is growing pretty quickly, but there are much fewer places that have comprehensive human rights protections for trans people. In the US they've been trying to pass federal legislation to make it illegal to discriminate against someone for their sexual orientation or gender identity, but conservatives are having none of that and many people in Congress have been pushing for a compromised version that excludes trans rights.   Actually there are more than two sexes - intersex people exist, and pansexual covers attraction to them as well.   US here. I say for fuck's sake relatively often, although not nearly as often as fucking hell.   I spent easily 5x more time in that level than I should have because I did my best to get rid of every damn block.   Well really it's more of a subset of the second one. It might be real but you're not it because once you fall in love with Prince Charming you'll get over it real fast. Because that's how women's sexuality works - you absolutely don't care about sex until you get married and then only for pleasing your husband and having kids. /s   In my experience, triggers aren't that predictable. You never really know when it will happen, and it might never go away. I haven't lived with my abuser for almost four years now and I still get anxiety attacks occasionally.  However, talking to a therapist and other survivors about it has helped me gain perspective and practice coping mechanisms for it. So even though the triggers haven't gone away, they don't affect me quite as badly because now I handle them a lot better. So there's that.  As far as moving on, you aren't "supposed" to do anything. You don't just "get over" abuse - it stays with you pretty much forever. But it usually starts to affect you less and less, gradually over time. Just take things at your own pace and do what's healthy for you. Talk to a therapist or abuse counselor if you aren't already. Do things a day at a time. Eventually it will get better.   Yeah, this sort of thing is super common and is really shitty. Black women have to deal with so much ridiculousness because of combined racism and sexism, I see it a lot in the southern US where I live. It really makes me want to be a better feminist and activist in general when I find threads like that, because a lot of people are totally clueless about how bad some women of color have it.   Mine was pretty fun! I got to hang out with some good friends for most of the weekend, although not much is new with my life. My SO, on the other hand, recently started dating someone he met on OkCupid that goes to our university. She came over Saturday and we all watched anime for a little while, then after I left to go hang with people they got some private time. And they had their first kiss! When I got home my SO was so happy and they're really adorable together so I'm glad things are going really well. :   I'm not sure yet. If I made a matching scarf it would be really big and take a lot of time and yarn (Journey scarves make the Fourth Doctor's scarf look like child's play). But I might make a scaled-down version, I dunno.   Maybe it only wants to stick around if it's combined with another colors and they can be friends   Huh ... not sure how that works, but ok, lol.   Well in my experience, freshman tend to be much less mature than upperclassmen (at least if they're not non-traditional students). They're younger and are just starting to gain more freedom from their parents' influence, so they don't always have experience in critical thinking skills or  making decisions for themselves. Therefore they're much more likely to go along with the status quo.  The good news is that in college, a lot of people I know went from being barely tolerable douchebags to actually being really awesome, well-rounded people. So the more you continue on, the better your peer group should get.  IN the mean time, though, just don't worry about the haters. Instead of thinking about the people leaving you as a loss of a friend, try to think of it as removing a person from your life who is not supporting you. Your time is valuable and finite - you shouldn't have to waste time on people who don't have your back.   That's what I'm afraid of! I don't want to have to redye it.  So which colors usually last longest, then?   /r/genderfluid might be a good place to check out too?   That sounds awesome! I've been thinking about doing some strawberry blonde, I've been flirting with the idea of red hair for a while now but I've heard it's really hard to manage compared to other dye colors.   I'd love to see it! An album of rainbow hair, lol. It might inspire me to do something fun with my hair :D   Generally, unless there is an entirely empty row or the empty seat is next to someone who is physically less threatening to me (isn't bigger than me, is elderly, etc.), I tend to stand. I live in a really sketchy part of town, and depend on public transportation to get where I need to go. This means that I and my roommates have all had various run-ins with people on busses. People have tried to solicit us for sex, tried to sell us drugs, have demanded money, tried to follow us, have sexually harassed us, or have told us we're going to hell for being queer, to name only a few occurrences. So yeah, I tend to just keep to myself as much as possible. Standing means less likely to get hassled.   You look so happy and fabulous! I love all your awesome hair colors :   I realize why you might want to create such a subreddit and that it might have the potential for doing a lot of good, but to me it seems like it also has way too much potential for abuse and I most likely will not be participating. The reason why existing subs have such strict rules is to create a safe space for oppressed peoples to have discussion; taking away those restrictions makes the space inherently less safe.   Actually, the modern definition is there to keep in mind the context in which certain actions happen. If person A and person B walk into a room and person B starts freaking out and refuses to talk to person A and wants to leave, according to your definition of prejudice person B is in the wrong. Why would they randomly do something like that just because of some arbitrary factor of person A's appearance or personality?  But then if you look at the situation in context and find out that person A belongs to a group of people that has systematically abused people like person B, that reaction starts to make a lot more sense. They react negatively to that person not because they are arbitrarily deciding that they don't like them, but because history and lived experience has taught them that being around that person will likely result in bad things happening. It will cause them stress, as well as the potential for physical harm or even death, with little consequences for person A.  To conclude, kids on a reservation not wanting to play with the white children which might hurt their feelings is in no way comparable to the systematic genocide which has been perpetuated against native peoples in the Americas for the last 500+ years.   When you invite an abuser and their victim to the same party, that's not a neutral ground. If you tell the victim to be "civil" to their abuser, that's not a neutral ground. Understand?  Exactly this. I wish I could upvote you more than once.   Finding more friends is also probably a good idea. I hope everything works out ok for you. Good luck in the future!   It's okay, just breathe!  I know that this sort of thing is really nerve-wracking, but perhaps it might help if you focus on something else while waiting for a response? After all, it's not like you can do anything about it until she texts you back, no matter what she says. So try to take a few minutes and relax, do something calming, and worry about what she'll do after she actually does it.   I don't think that it's necessarily bad for them to want to participate in the comments, but they shouldn't be overstepping their bounds. Obviously this subreddit is meant to get women's opinions or thoughts on things, so if a bunch of guys answered with their thoughts or opinions all the time it would kind of defeat the point.  Of course, I still think they should be allowed to respond to women's answers. Like if they wanted to compare a response they see to their own observations, or ask for more details, or even just to say "TIL".  So yeah, basically as long as they don't try to take over the subreddit it shouldn't be too big of an issue.   Non-transitioning transwoman still means you're a woman. I would say it's actually pretty important for you to answer so that we have different perspectives. If straight white cis women were the only people who responded to questions people would get incomplete or even misleading answers sometimes, so really your responses could be very helpful!   That's a really tough position to be in. I've also had issues with people I'm really good friends with then getting SOs and kind of ignoring everyone else. This isn't an issue with you necessarily, but more likely an issue with your friend and her bf. A lot of people fall into the trap of hanging out almost exclusively with their partner to the detriment of their other relationships. It happens.  Honestly, to me it seems like her bf is a little too controlling. If he was getting super jealous and making a fuss over her hanging out with you, it's possible he twisted her arm until she caved and stopped hanging out with you to make him feel more comfortable. That's pretty stupid, especially since you don't seem to be romantically interested in her, just really good friends. If that is what happened, bad on him for being really possessive and bad on her for not standing up to him.  It's also possible that they're just going through a kind of honeymoon phase since they just got to move in together. If he lived farther away before and they didn't get to see each other that often, it's only natural that she would want to hang out with him a lot now that she has the opportunity, but she takes you for granted because you've always been close by. That will start to fade at some point, though. It's really hard to only hang out with your SO for extended periods of time.  My advice is to just wait this out for a little while. If your friend continues to ignore you in favor of her SO, try to talk to her about it. If she really cares for you she'll probably try to hang out with you at least a little more, regardless of what her boyfriend says. Also, it may or may not help to talk to this bf and tell him that you're not trying to steal her away and make her your gf or anything, but this girl is a close friend and it sucks that he's monopolizing all her time. She should be able to socialize with whomever she wants.   I'd say that you sound like someone who is bi- or homoflexible-romantic ace. Really that's up to you. Of course, lots of people who identify as gay or otherwise queer have had hetero relationships in the past and truly liked the person(s) they were with. But sometimes you just realize that sort of thing isn't what you prefer. That's okay.  FYI, lots of bi people (ace or otherwise) have a preference for one gender. I've known bi people who were physically attracted to one gender and romantically attracted to another, or who preferred one gender but didn't mind dating or having sex with people who weren't that gender. You don't have to like everyone equally to be biromantic. Really though the label is more about what you're comfortable with and what you want to communicate to other people about yourself, so if you're at the point where you don't really want to be with men then identifying as homoromantic is fine.   Yes. This happens to me a lot.  Of course, I'm fairly masculine and often cross-dress so most people read me as "butch lesbian." I have short hair, I hang out with a lot of dudes, I love action movies and play video games ... I guess I fit a lot of the stereotypes that people assume apply to lesbians.  Strangely, though, people will often assume that I'm straight if they meet me with my SO, who is male. So with new people it often goes either way. Meet us as a couple, I'm a straight tomboy. Meet me by myself, I'm a butch lesbian. Meanwhile I just go "you're all wrong but it will take way too much effort to correct you so whatever."   I had to read through a lot of stuff for my epidemiology class last semester about this sort of thing. According to the CDC, it's a problem because people demand antibiotics for everything (they were marketed as a magic bullet for decades) and doctors cave in, plus with factory farms and whatnot we're pumping our animals full of antibiotics and then you get MRSA.    There's also the "you just haven't found the right person yet" argument. I've heard that one soooooo many times.   My personal experience with other queer people has been pretty similar to yours. Other GSM people have only been slightly more likely to be aware of asexuality compared to straight people I've come out to. And I've had more than my share of people tell me that it's not really a thing and I'm just trying to be a "special snowflake" and I'm taking attention away from the "real" queers. It sucks. But fortunately not everyone is like that.   Well speaking as a kid who was adopted, it's less about who your parents are and more about the fact that they love you. There are tons of kids in foster care who need to be adopted into loving homes. By adopting you are giving that kid a new chance at a life they wouldn't have otherwise. That doesn't suddenly change because you're gay.  I'm glad someone else was able to help you find UK-related info!   Well usually I would say yes, it is possible, because lots of asexual people have sex with their partners, myself included, with relatively few issues. However, if you've already tried lubes, foreplay, etc. and you are still having issues, it's probably time to talk to a doctor. It's possible that there's something going on with your body if penetrative sex isn't going well, so it's probably a good idea to talk to a gyno just in case.   But there was also another episode where they got caught in nightmares manufactured by Doctor Destiny (John Dee - also I loved the historical reference for that character). Flash's nightmare was that he was so fast everyone else just stopped moving. He became isolated because he was just too fast for other people. So I'd say it's probably still something he thinks a lot about.   I just rewatched all of the Justice League cartoon. The number of times where Batman must think "fuck, uh, hang on ... lemme pull out my gadgets" whenever all the other members just decide to fly/run super fast to get somewhere was a lot higher than I remembered from my childhood days.   Yes. It seems like a lot of anime these days just uses blatant fan-service to get ratings, and it is sooooooo tiring. So few shows are willing to go without unnecessary or nonsensical gratuitous T A anymore.  Literally the only show I can think of that I've watched recently without any fan service or vapid female characters is Attach on Titan. That's it.   That's rough. I recommend a nice nap.   Honestly, I don't get it either. You can still have a fantastic, memorable event without having to spend tens of thousands of dollars. That's just ridiculous. You don't need a $15,000 dress. You don't need caviar or expensive alcohol. You don't need a lot of the nonsense that some people have at their weddings. It's basically just a show of financial status these days more than a celebration of love for a lot of people. But in ten or twenty years, that won't matter - no one will really care how much money you spent on your wedding. What's important is that you and your family and friends all got together and made some memories.   Who says that museums aren't entertaining? I love looking at different pieces of history.   Thanks for such a well-written response. Honestly, I don't go to the library as much as I used to, but when I was a kid it was one of my favorite places to go. I've always been a huge reader, and I didn't have money for a tablet or ereader (or even new books, really) so the library helped me get access to all sorts of books. It definitely improved my quality of life - most of the things I know I know from reading, and it gave me a good head start in school that I otherwise wouldn't have had.  Plus, there is an important social component to libraries. Like you said, they are community spaces. I would often go to the library to hang out with friends after school. They often have workshops where you can learn new skills, or book clubs where you can meet people with common interests. It's a lot harder to get that sort of thing for free on the internet - people who live near you that can give you that sort of experience. Not to say that forums and chat rooms can't do similar things, but I don't think that interaction online will ever fully replace interaction in the real world.  Also, the library policy changes made after 9/11 just proves how awesome libraries are, at least imho.   As far as the kids thing goes, it's not impossible. I don't know how adoption laws work in the UK but that seems like a pretty viable option. Of course if you wanted your own biological child and had some money you could use a donor egg and surrogate mom. So you should tell your mom that grandkids aren't completely out of the picture.  On the other hand, you still have the issue that same sex relationships "make her feel ill." Honestly, this is kind of silly, but a lot of straight people have the homophobic tendency to be a little squeamish about gay couples. Hopefully, though, she'll get over it with time, especially if she realizes that there really isn't a reason to be squeamish and if she sees you being happy in a relationship.  A support group would probably be a good idea for your parents, or at least your mom. Again, I don't live in the UK so I don't know any specifics, but you should try searching on the internet for an LGBTQ organization in your area. They can likely help you out with finding resources for your parents, possibly a support group, or even just talking to them - they're probably more practiced at it than you are and they might be able to give your parents some perspective. Plus, it always helps to hear it from multiple people.  Other than that, just keep doing what you've been doing. Answer their questions and show them you love them. Your parents seem like they're just worried about you, but once they get used to the fact that you're gay they probably won't worry as much about it.  I hope that helps, and good luck!   I'm glad that you feel better about yourself! No, there is nothing wrong with you. You're just like the rest of us :   Wow, what a dirtbag. It's totally okay to be bothered by someone saying shitty things about you, regardless of how immature and stupid they are. Just remember that it's better to not respond, because that kind of moron is only going to hurl more and more insults at you.   I'd say that ultimately joining is up to you. I've found that the LGBTQ organizations on my campus are nice to go to if for no other reason than to have people I can talk to about being queer. Although there aren't that many aces on campus that are also active in the groups, it does help a little to be around other people who you know are more likely to be aware of your identity and less likely to judge you for it (although there are still some people who can be just as nasty as the rest of the heteronormative world).  If you don't think you'll get any good out of it, though, there's not much of a point in joining. If I were you I'd at least try it out for a little while just to see if I'd like it or not, but I wouldn't say it's unreasonable to not want to.   they group sets of believes and people subscribe to all of them, without judging each individual one on their merits  This is not true. That's why each broader movement has so many different subgroups. People are individuals, not hive-minds. No label is perfect, nor does any one person truly fit perfectly with that label.  Also, your description of what feminists "generally" do is merely a generalization. I've had many, many discussions with people where they were willing to debate or answer questions, and I always make an effort to do so unless someone is deliberately being offensive. Although, it is true that further discussion is often easier whenever someone is at least somewhat familiar with theory, thus feminists (or any other person with extensive knowledge in a topic) will often recommend reading to people who are interested in finding out more.  I can't speak for all feminists or the entire movement, but the way I try to approach things is to try to work with people to create awareness of problems, find solutions, and work toward a common goal. It's not about who is superior, because no one is truly superior, at least not in the sense that you're using the word. What's more important is that people learn from one another; sometimes I am teaching other people, but just as often I learn new things as well. No one knows anything, so anyone who thinks that they're superior to everyone else has a flawed personality or worldview.  That's my two cents, anyhow.   Well the point that I was trying to make is that trans people are more likely to experience societal privileges as long as no one knows they're trans, either before they ever come out/start transitioning or after they've fully transitioned and go stealth. Of course, even after transitioning a lot of trans people still have to deal with a lot of stuff, especially if they get outed.   Yep. People tend to assume I'm a lesbian all the time when they meet me. And I've gotten a lot of the "you probably just haven't met the right one yet" line more than a few times.   Gay guys that do that drive me crazy. Seriously, it's okay that you're not into vaginas. But you really don't need to go around constantly talking about how disgusting you think they are. It's not like there's a magical vagina fairy that can wave a wand and make them all pretty so they sparkle or shoot rainbows. We don't get to wish on a star and magically transform our bodies to please everyone. Jeez.   Yeah, there's that ... one of my good friends used to joke that Seed/Destiny were basically just really long toy commercials, because allllll the model kits.   Trust me, you're not missing much. You would only rage at her more as the series went on.   Seed and seed destiny were pretty terrible in general, let's be honest.   That's a good idea. I'll save up a bit and check it out.   Well I am, and I call myself a feminist. I understand why a lot of people have issues with it but really the only way to fix the movement is from within, so refusing to call yourself a feminist just because you don't agree with some feminists isn't really effective, at least imho. To each their own, though.   Same. Also, whenever I was watching Seed Destiny there was a character that I pretty much instantly hated and couldn't figure out why until I realized they used the same voice actress for both characters.   Good! I'm glad I could help. :   I'm so jealous! I've always wanted to do loom-weaving but I would never be able to afford a large loom like that. The most I can manage is a tiny bead loom ...   Same! I just love to hate Dio. His rivalry with Jojo is just too delicious to watch.   Flay Allster, from Gundam Seed.  On top of being incredibly racist, she is pretty much the culmination of every negative stereotype about women ever. She uses her body to make connections with powerful men to get what she wants (while cheating on her fiance). She flaunts her body to get attention. She's emotionally manipulative. She's completely fucking useless every time they're in battle and just goes running to some boy crying for protection. Oh, and she very nearly manages to fuck up several battles and almost the entire war for her side.  She is literally the worst character in any anime I've ever seen.   Thanks for the link! It's a pretty good one.  I really like that the speaker brought up the blog quotes talking about how just because you're not trying to get in a woman's pants doesn't automatically make you a feminist. I've talked to so many women who have had gay guys critically comment on their appearance, touch or grope their bodies without permission, etc. but when they tell them no the man will respond "oh, it's okay, I'm gay, it's not like I want to have sex with you."   Seriously, just because you aren't physically attracted to someone doesn't mean it's okay for you to say that they're ugly, or tell them their genitals are nasty, or to fondle their breasts or ass. That shit is not cool.   Honestly, though, the academic discourse isn't even the problem so much as their misapplication of it - the idea that having a penis gives you privilege is true, even in the case of trans women, because for at least some portion of their lives trans women are raised as male. So while they are living as male, they do have privileges women don't. But that changes once they start to transition because people start to perceive them as female. If people assume you have a vagina they will treat you like they treat anyone else with a vagina. And this is what makes it so hard for trans women - they're getting misogyny from people, and if they don't pass well or are outed they have to deal with transmisogyny too.  But for some reason radfems can't see this. Having a penis doesn't mean you are always perceived as male, and unless you are perceived as male by society you won't get the privileges associated with having a penis.  Also, yes, you are the absolute worst kind of dick of you shit on trans people in the name of female solidarity.   Most of the changes that I liked were really small, because I appreciate subtlety. But I think that one of my favorites is probably the alterations to Tyrion and Sansa's wedding.  In the books, we view the wedding from Sansa's POV, so we're getting all of her internal thought processes throughout the ceremony. During the whole affair we read how humiliating and traumatizing this is for her. At one point she was promised to Joffrey, the prince of the kingdom, whom she assumed was as gallant as all the stories made knights out to be. Then he executed her father and viciously abused her, as well as making most of the knights she would have gone to for help complicit in that abuse. She was deemed practically untouchable after her father was declared "traitor," and she ends up being handed off to Tyrion, who is quite possibly the most insulting marriage proposal she could possibly be given. Not only is he a Lannister (therefore an enemy of her family), he is her abuser's uncle (so she will never be rid of him), and to top it all off he's a dwarf (which everyone in the kingdom seems more than happy to ridicule him for).  Understandably, Sansa is not happy about the situation. But she's also made it this far by the fact that she's pretty much gone along with whatever tortures the Lannisters think up for her. If she objects, she could very well be the next to die. But she can't just take it. So she fights back in what little way she can - by refusing to bow to allow Tyrion to cloak her as part of the ceremony. In her mind, she is refusing to debase herself further in an already terrible situation. Eventually, Tyrion is forced to climb on someone's back to finish the cloaking.  However, this scene only works when told from Sansa's POV. If the scene played out the same way in the show, all we would get out of it would be Sansa, for some inexplicable reason, suddenly deciding to be an asshole to Tyrion, a character that everyone seems to like considerably more than her. It would not do well in the show since we don't have access to Sansa's thoughts and reasoning for doing such a thing.  So rather than try to make the scene work as it exists, they changed it for the show, and I think it was a masterful stroke. This time around, Tyrion had a step stool placed so that he could easily reach Sansa's shoulders for the cloaking, but Joffrey being the sadistic scum that he is decides to pull it away at the last second. Then Sansa bows so he can cloak her. I love how they decided to change the scene, because it takes care of all the issues presented by portraying it from an outside rather than first-person perspective while still keeping everyone in character. In the show version we have Joffrey being a dick rather than Sansa being the one who is humiliating Tyrion, which means we don't have people feeling conflicted or irritated with Sansa when they're supposed to be relating to her. Instead, we just hate Joffrey more, which only helps the story along. Plus, we have Sansa witnessing how Joffrey tortures Tyrion just like he tortures her - this is a good setup for their later relationship. Eventually Sansa comes to like and trust Tyrion a little, despite her wariness over his lineage, because she can relate to how he suffers and realizes that he's not nearly as bad as his father, sister, or nephew. By having Joff humiliate Tyrion at the wedding, Sansa can immediately relate to her new husband; this means she's still in character as well, despite the contradicting actions her character takes in the book to movie transition.  I know that I wrote a lot about something so tiny but speaking as someone who loves literature and has studied theater techniques I just really appreciate what they did in the show to this particular scene.   I'm sure that Ned would have fought for himself if he was healthy, but considering he'd been injured fighting Jaime there's no way that would happen. Ned is honorable, but not suicidal. Given the chance he might have named a champion, but we'll never know because that's not the way it went down.   You know, I never caught that. Although I haven't discovered anything else to confirm or deny whether or not Varys heard the conversation, it would be really interesting if he had. It certainly has some interesting implications for how Ned's betrayal turned out.   You didn't format your spoiler properly ... might want to fix that.   There is unfortunately an entire subreddit dedicated to this stuff. It made me weep for feminists and women everywhere ...   To be fair, not all feminists think that way - in fact, third-wave feminism focuses on intersectionality and is a lot more inclusive to queer women, women of color, and other minority groups than feminism has ever been in the past. The blog post OP linked to represents one radical sect of feminism, and those views are not shared by everyone in the movement, any more than trans-exclusion is practiced by everyone in the queer rights movement.   TERFs are probably one of the worst things to ever come out of the feminist movement. It's so disgusting. A lot of their rantings sound very similar to the KKK's arguments about race traitors and whatnot. Trans women are not threatening other women, they often have it worse than cis women do. Radfems who cannot seem to understand that ... it makes me so sad and angry. Everything would be so much better for all of us if women would stop acting like this and actually band together to help out ALL women, not just the women who are like them.   I honestly have no idea why so many gynos are men ... it's weird. Maybe it has something to do with the fact that there are fewer female doctors in general, I dunno.   For most of my life I didn't know anyone else who was openly asexual, although I wasn't entirely open about it either.  However, when I started college I moved to the only city that (at the time) was the only one in the state that had passed comprehensive anti-discrimination laws for queer people (including trans*, which is still really uncommon). For those of you who live in the U.S., I live in a state that has been red for the last four elections. For everyone else, it's pretty much conservative except in a few major cities.  The result of this legislation, though, is that my city has a comparatively huge population of GRSM people. My school has a large and very active queer student activity center and activism group. And I now know probably 5x as many queer people as I used to in high school, at least.  This has included several ace people. My current roommate and his partner identify as ace or demi, a friend of mine from a school club is ace, and after coming out on facebook I found out that a friend from my high school days is ace as well. We've had a lot of conversations about identity and ace issues, and it's been really great. For my entire childhood I felt isolated and lonely because literally none of my friends knew how I felt. Now, I have people I can turn to that understand how I feel about romance, sex, relationships, etc. without me having to explain a totally new concept to them.  It hasn't always gone well, however. There have still been some people who, after I tell them about my identity, have claimed to feel the same way and then it later turned out they weren't being entirely honest. One person in particular lied to his partner (whom I was good friends with) and said he was asexual merely to avoid having sex with him. When my friend later found out about the lie and told me about it I was pretty upset. This person used my identity as an excuse to get out of something, when telling the truth would have been easier anyway, and then tried to make out like he was the victim. Ugh. It's hard enough to get people to take me seriously when I tell them about asexuality - there are so many who are willing to dismiss me by saying I can't or don't actually feel that way. People like him who fake it just make things so much worse.   Telling them you're asexual might be difficult, but telling them you're not interested isn't nearly as hard. A lot of guys don't want to hear that, though, and just ignore what you say unfortunately ...   How do you prevent any domestic abuse from happening? Like I said, problematic situations come up in any marriage, not just polygamy. The only way to prevent exploitation is to have a bunch of decent human beings get together. You can't argue that polygamy is a huge issue for exploitation and therefore we shouldn't have it because monogamous relationships have the exact same potential for exploitation. Unless you want to get rid of marriage or relationships altogether this sort of thing will happen. The only way to change it is to change patriarchal attitudes, which a lot of people in modern polyamorous relationships are already doing.  And really you don't have to make tons of extra laws and regulations. Every partner involved in a polygamous marriage would have the same rights as any other married couple.   Oh, good! I would hate to be sick on a holiday. I hope you feel all better really soon!   The most I've ever had in one sitting is two drinks, so I've never had issues with hangovers. I do not envy you there. Honestly I have just as much fun watching other people get drunk and be silly as other people have fun getting drunk, so I never felt a huge need to drink too much.  Still, it seems like you would have been okay with only three shots and that much food.   Oh jeez. That's not good. Did someone else buy drinks and put them on your tab or something? I imagine it's hard for one person to drink over $500 worth of alcohol in one night ...   Those sorts of issues aren't inherent to polygamous relationships, however. Also, not all polygamy is polygyny (multiple women with one male partner) - there are also historical situations in which polyandry was common and in fact beneficial.  Really, though, in Western patriarchal society, marriage PERIOD is oppressive to women. So as we improve marriage in general, polygamous marriages are improved.  Plus, I really don't see the point in arguing that because something is harder or more complicated we shouldn't do it. Of course poly relationships require more effort and are more complicated than relationships with only two people. Large extended families also tend to be more difficult to manage and more complex than families with single or no children. That doesn't mean people shouldn't have five or six kids if they have the means, or that three or more generations of a family can't live together. There are plenty of situations in which poly groups are just as good or even better than the "traditional" nuclear family, despite being more complex. To use an analogy, if we were talking about math you wouldn't say that we shouldn't teach calculus to anyone because it's more complicated and harder than simple addition, would you?  Really this isn't a matter of something being bad because it's complicated, it's a matter of everyone doing what's right for them. For some people, that happens to be polyamory and polygamy. For others, it's monogamy.   I love how this guy is describing polygamy like it would be the most awful ridiculous thing ever, but in reality it sounds kind of nice. I totally wouldn't mind if my primary partner and I and anyone else we bring into our relationship could all live together in one big happy group marriage.   Hello, everyone! How was your New Year's Eve?  Mine was rather eventful. I just happened to start my shark week yesterday (ugh) and I have really awful cramps, especially on the first day. Then on top of that my SO wanted to go to this party where I basically knew him and one other guy (he'll be M) at all well. I'd also met a lot of the other attendees but I only see them once in a while and I certainly wouldn't consider them friends but more like acquaintances. I'm the type of person that likes to hang out with people I know well at large parties, so I'm usually uncomfortable when I only have one or two friends but everyone else knows each other really well. So I assumed that I would most likely be miserable for most of the night.  Instead, I actually had a lot of fun! I was probably the only person who didn't drink much - I had a small glass of champagne and just had soda the rest of the night (didn't want to feel drunk icky on top of period icky). Everyone else seemed to be having a good time for the most part. I had some really great conversations with people that I didn't know that well, which was really fun and unexpected.  Then a few people got a little too drunk ... or maybe a lot. Our one friend (let's call him T) had apparently started drinking before coming to the party we were at, and had quite a bit while we were there, so he was pretty wrecked. He threw up Linda Blair style all over like three other people. They were obviously upset but took it all in stride and started a mini shirtless guy party, so much fun was still had by all. Well, M ended up taking care of T while he prayed to the porcelain god, so I stayed downstairs and chatted with M's girlfriend, C. Then C ended up getting sick too, although not so sick she passed out like T did ... poor guy.  I can't say I expected to spend two or so hours holding back some girl's hair that I barely knew as part of my New Year's celebrations, but I don't really regret it. C is really nice, and we ended up getting along really well despite the puking. We kinda bonded last night, and the four of us (my SO, C, M, and I) all agreed to hang out more in the future, sans alcohol.  That said, I hope that the rest of you had fun ushering in the new year, and that nobody got seriously hurt while drinking. Just remember that you have to watch your friends and make sure to take care of each other so that no one drinks too much or get hurt. Nobody wants to make a hospital visit on NYE.   Unfortunately, even gay men often think that they are entitled to power over women's bodies. In this case, this dude thinks he is entitled to rating your physical appearance. I would say that is definitely rude, regardless of his sexuality. His opinion was not asked for, nor did it need to be given.   Don't worry, it's totally normal to be worried about this sort of thing. Since you're worried about pain, I assume you're female-bodied? Or are you concerned about hurting a female-bodied partner? Either way, I'll try to give you some tips.  1. Don't have sex before you're ready. This should seem obvious, but a lot of teens are pressured into doing something that they later regret. I'm not going to tell you that you absolutely shouldn't have sex until you're older (although 15 is a little young, and can have legal implications depending on where you live and the age of your partner). However, if you want to have sex you should make sure that you're doing it because it's what you want, not because you feel obligated to or your partner wants you to do it.  2. Just because you aren't "turned on" by someone in general doesn't mean that your body won't have a physiological response to sexual situations. Even as an ace, if someone touches you, you will most likely experience some parts of physical arousal - for instance, if you are female bodied you will still lubricate or "get wet." This is something that happens regardless of sexual desire - women's bodies have evolved to be that way in case of sexual trauma so that they aren't severely hurt. So if you are concerned about lubrication, this will most likely not be an issue, although if it is you can still use artificial lubricant.  3. This leads to your comment about condom/lube use. [This link](http://www.healthyhorns.utexas.edu/hs_lube.html) has some quick tips for combinations of condoms and lube. You can buy these sorts of things online or in any drug store. Just make sure to read all instructions carefully to make sure that you are using each product correctly, and that combining them won't cause issues - usually a lube will have a label saying if it is safe for use with latex condoms. I would highly recommend using a condom, even if you or your partner is using other forms of birth control, to reduce the risk of infections or STDs. Safer sex every time means you develop good habits and have less risk in the future!  4. Go slowly. Especially if it is your first time having sex. Instead of jumping straight into penetrative sex, take a little bit of time to kiss and touch with your partner. You can then move on to manual stimulation or oral sex. This will help for a lot of reasons - first, it will help you become more familiar with your partner and get more comfortable with them. Second, it can help you become more physically relaxed and receptive to sex. If you have vaginal sex, it allows for more time to produce enough lubrication. Once you do start having penetrative vaginal or anal sex, you should still go slowly at first. For someone who is female-bodied, it will most likely be uncomfortable or even slightly painful at first if you have an unbroken hymen. If at any point you or your partner experiences moderate/high amounts of pain, stop right away. Sex should never hurt that badly (unless you want it to).  5. Once you become sexually active, you should make sure to tell your doctor. If you are female-bodied, this often also means starting to see a gynocologist. Most doctors recommend that you start seeing a gyno when you are 18 or if you are sexually active, whichever comes first. This is important for your continued sexual health - going to see your gyno for regular pap smears ensures that you don't have any issues, and the gyno can also answer any questions you have about sex or sexual health and address any issues you might have.  I hope that answers a lot of the questions you have so far. If you want to know anything else, shoot me a reply or a message. This was just generic info that would be helpful for anyone but I can also tell you more about my personal experience if you're interested.   To answer your initial question, no, being transexual does not mean you have the sexuality of the opposite sex. It means that your gender does not align with your physiological sex. Those are two very different things.  If you feel like you should have a vagina or breasts or that you are too hairy, etc. that is called gender dysphoria. You feel like the current state of your body doesn't quite match up with what should be there, right? I'd say that's a pretty big sign you're trans. Of course, you should probably talk to a queer-friendly counselor about this - they can help you better understand those feelings and you can discuss the possibility of transitioning with them.  As far as having a lot in common with gay men, I don't see anything particularly wrong with that. Personally, I'm female but I usually relate a lot more easily to guys because I'm fairly masculine. That doesn't invalidate my womanhood or identity. You're allowed to like what you like - no two women are the same, and there is no one "right" way to be female. Plus, peeing standing up is a pretty useful skill, especially if you don't have a toilet handy while camping or what have you.  So don't worry too much about that sort of thing! I hope that clears some things up for you, and I hope that you figure out your identity and find happiness in the future.   The first time I went to see a gyno, my mom told me to go to the guy she sees, but she had to work that day so she had her mom (my grandma) take me. It was then that grandma told me that not only does she also see the same gyno, but he delivered me. And he also delivered my mom. So basically this dude has been around to see three generations of my family's vagina.   Wow. After reading through some of these comments I'm a bit disappointed. There are a lot of people on here who don't seem to understand the idea that cross-dressing can be another form of gender expression and you don't have to be MTF or FTM transgender in order to want to dress differently. Some people just feel more comfortable or that they look better wearing different clothes. Why is it such a huge issue that a man wants to wear dresses and makeup but still be a man? THERE ARE LOTS OF DIFFERENT KINDS OF QUEER MKAY  	106
 Well, Bo Peep happened. Never expected that.    That's genius! But I think you're forgetting McGucket's transformation, that'll definitely cause trouble for them.    Well, looks like I can throw that all away.   But if he dies, then... what happens to the other one?    Dat ain't Falco.    Soos Gumby is my new role model.    All aboard the hype train!   First off:  A. Talking Waddles will be amazing.  B. Claymotion will be amazing.  C. Jessie/Spider-Man crossover is literally the one thing Marvel fans feared would happen once Disney bought Marvel. ONE JOB. Putting the superheroes in a Disney cartoon is OK, but putting the Disney characters in the superhero cartoon? UGH.    If the only reference is the title, I'll be slightly disappointed. Little Shop was the last musical I performed in, and I loved it.        I volunteer as tribute.    It's good to be the King.    The more I watch, the funnier it gets. Great job, man!   Turns out a few other characters were announced a while back:  -Paper Mario. Paper Mario lacks range by himself, so summoning his partners will allow him to control the stage and combo with speed.   -Lip. Her wand will drain health from enemies, so naturally her weaker attacks are powered up when you use them in tandem with her flower powers. Racking up damage has never been so satisfying.   -Robotnik. This is a upgrade character. He can use his skills to repair his weaponry, allowing him to increase power, range and knockback. All of this disappears when he's KO'd, though. A good example is his recovery, the jetpack. It will blast farther and release more flames as it's upgraded. Think Engineer from TF2 and Lucas from PM combined.   That's all I can reveal at the moment, but we're working furiously.    I love SSF2 and Crusade, both are awesome games. But I do notice things that they hit or miss on, and I want to kind of do my own thing that makes Affinity unique from other fan games or the console installments.    C# for Unity.   	15
  Don't pursue her through texts, use texts to arrange meet ups. Texts can easily be misinterpreted and not to your advantage.  I'm a girl and cannot agree more with this. I personally don't like texting someone I barely know at length and many of my friends feel the same way. Face-to-face is the way to go!   	1
 Homogenized milk is gay!   The NFL says so grammy. You can't spike football's anymore either.    Well I found this article here that says in primates that a closed mouth smile is friendly, but if they smile with an open mouth it's a sign of aggression. I think the same would apply to humans. But no reals, only feels.   http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/it-seems-that-in-almost-a/   Thoughts? That sounds displeasant   I always felt down after rolling. It didn't help my depression.    You don't like cindy?   Fuck wrong with you?   Yea I can squat like 180.  #blessed #bodybuilding #protein   Assssshhh   Sure   A real human bean   Dan's. Best butcher in town   Tips hijab    A professional diagnosis   You've seen fight club? You must be the coolest eighth grader around   How would you get a hold of scopolamine?   It doesn't start off as either really. It's an in between thing   There is no room in the budget for college, not when the military needs more tanks it doesn't want!   You're stressed. Just study and do well in your finals and you'll feel much better   I like that everyone always jolts awake and ready immediately, like no one wakes up one eye at a time   Why is Hawaiian food so popular I in Utah   The gravy too right?   I couldn't figure out why my cat was gaining weight, until I found out all my roommates were feeding her. She was playing us all   This gave me an anti boner. I feel unsettled now   Bring a laser pointer and watch people lose their minds when they can't figure out the red dot   Bottle it up and crush it with alcohol, duh silly!   Top dank    That guy is all pupils   Fatty   Why would an anti-capitalist be again food irradiation, nuclear energy and genetic modification?  I didn't want to go past that comment    I didn't know fedoras and video game t shirts were popular in the 80s   Maybe they want to restructure as well and it would just be easier this way, or they just want a new identity for a new company   I assume Charlie Hebdo probably made fun of the US drone strike too.    Inflammatory and calling for murder are two wildly different things.    Get a cat every time you feel lonely.    Wizards of the coast made both pokemon and yu gi oh tcg right?   Animals in restaurants doesn't seem sanitary   So essentially anything that crawled out of the water is the same as a human?   You can't start a statement like that.    And you never once paid for drugs!   First half of this movie is amazing. Second half is complete batshit stupid   Get the fuck off my yacht   You think they just spend all the money themselves? You haven't seen the documentary then. These guys get taken advantage of by everyone. The sharks can smell the money. It's really heartbreaking   What's with the beach balls?   Those bloody scotts!    Well quit showing her your penis!   It adds character haha   I always heard a vacuum can deglove your member   Butch hen!   So it's just A walk to remember?   You wanna know the hard truth about the world? Sometimes people can be shitty.    Proof that shame doesn't work?   So, all of them pretty much?   Actors shouldn't act. They should be.    There are weather cheat codes.for single player. You can make it snow   If I was blazed I would think cousin w sounds good.    I'll check it out. I normally never go into the gas station   If it lasts longer than four hours call more ladies   Human?      Do when I have to go back to work. Ugh this us such bullshit. I had the last three days off work and I got giftcards and my ps4 is useless   Lizard squad, lizard squad, lizard squad!   Are they voldemort or something?   And the Sony cleric said "ye of little faith. Just give us money and stuff like this won't happen. Ignore all the other hacks in our movie department too."   Is this ferg shaba      I live in a house with multiple ps4$ and my dragon age save file is stuck in psn. This is do dumb   Right. I feel super safe knowing some guy is blazed out of his mind flying down a diamond track.    I haven't seen a MAD magazine in so long. I keep an eye out for them    I have something crucial to sing about! Lol. If it really was important you wouldn't sing it.    Well I don't think everyone in the world uses botnets like these hackers do to hack in to psn.    Duh. Their stuff is shit, and your shit is stuff.    Right. So it's a tool hackers use, but it's not hacking. Square and rectangles man.    Are they not exploiting network weaknesses?   But this poor multi billion dollar company who had been hacked multiple times just within this last month did nothing wrong and obviously had the best network security. There is nothing they could do, since this is soooo unprecedented   The animation for it is much better than the knife, especially if you get them from behind   Yes if I paid for security features that are routinely exploited and circumvented. But if that was the problem they would recall it and pay for it.    If I paid for security features for my car, and you routinely circumvented them or exploited them, then yes I would   Stab everyone with the cavalry dagger. It's the best   They aren't compatible. Different servers   You wouldn't want to beg the comparison, Lindsey   Why? If any other business messes up their product I expect something from them in return. A restaurant messes up my meal and it's free. Why is Sony different?   The whole point of paying for psn was so this doesn't happen. It's been ddos more since I paid for it than when it was free.    It's still their product.    It's Christmas and PSN has been down all day. Xbl is back up. Just give me a free game. Shit give us the full Driveclub   Scientist=atheist duh   Just go by yourself. No one cares but you   Yea, but that's xbox. We're better than that. /s   I don't see anyone complaining about the friendzone in here   The reptile gang   So common people got married in a ceremony that was legally binding?   Cocaine, duh   One of us   I feel homosexual about them   Look at all my shit! That scene was a Carlin bit gone wrong/right   I like socialism. And cock apparently   I've always wondered that. In ye olden times I thought it was only nobles who married, and the peasants and poorer people just kind of did a common law thing. Does anyone know what marriage was like before recent times?   I prefer every body type, except fat.       Word.       Yea what a bitch   Kibble! My favorite!    The shoplifting sensor keeps going off, but we can't find anything on her!   Yeah, but look at his badge   It's why some people are models, and others redditors.    Like a medium rare penis   Me too!  I was just talking to my girlfriend about this the other day. I would like a more 3d environment too, but I feel like that would be a different game then.    Ok I haven't seen it yet so: DEADLY PREMONITION. I got this when it came out for 360.  It's similar to survival horror, but everything seems fundamentally broken and there is no horror. It's just bizarre and I recommend it to most people.    I have put so much time into that game   Yea she's not even skateboarding. Just perched on a bar looking at a skateboard   That seems a bit silly to cancel the service because you disagree with one film. There are countless films that just anger me by existing on Netflix, but I wouldn't cancel my service over one.    It's not?   Don't worry, we're looking into it   It's that a piss jug in the tail gate?   Gotta be down to clown if you want some juggaluv   I was gang raped by a group of mimes. They did unspeakable things to me.   I don't do racist jokes though. Racism is a crime. And crime is for black people.   	116
 Touch sir, touch.  Still dicks in my opinion. You don't have to play a supportive role, but you shouldn't say "it's undesirable" because saying that to someone who already is on the edge can just push them over.   They're dicks.   I love you.  ;)   Oh my god, I need to play again, anyone know how to sign up?   It does suck indeed.   I'm glad I live in AZ so I can use 5% dark just looks good with grabber.   Its... Beautiful..   Simply had a more updated version of core than I needed. Silly me! Now I need to get CD to work haha   Actually I got it! We're good! Thank you. :)!   I put core in mods and treecap+connected in coremods and I get errors  http://pastebin.com/cZGp3TQ9   bsp in mods, tree in mods and cd in core?  Is that how this would work?  'Cause I have no idea where to put these and it's just so confusing.   Thank you! I will try it and get back. :)   How would I go about adding treecap and connected destruction to my FTB 1.5.2 beta server? I've tried and I've broke my server more than once, so any help would be lovely!   Neat.   Would you not do the same? What was he supposed to buy?   Wasn't this JUST on the front page?   The only case where I find a vert attractive.  Good job, in my opinion you did a very good job on it.   It is.   wow.   Anytime mate!   simply amazing, will be listening to as often as I can. Good job Jaredw!   maybe its time...   holy shit, enough was the PSA's, we know its WarZ, damn.   Totally me.   Anything "Love Escapes Me"  [Heart Stealer](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxr8WK5H4gM)   You could always try exercising, I know it's not really a skill or anything, but it's a start. Just do a little bit and so on..   Holy fuck I didn't even notice it.   Just in time for a Plane crash at SFO.   Thank you. :)   I really doubt he's dead. They're getting a stretcher and he's not covered.   Oh god, R.I.P.  But seriously, the game is fun and such just don't get pulled in too fast too quick. Remember, if someone wants to hang outside, do it or you'll be lonelier.   Oh no, I didn't make that long post. I was just making an observation. :P   Such a simple reply...   Chills.  I hope you have an amazing life. :) We/re all glad you didn't kill yourself.   That's perfectly okay.   That's disgusting!   I traded in all my stuff, and I'll be playing PC until PS4.   Gotta test shit somewhere.   Damn, so should I just get a PS3 and play them that way, before the PS4 comes out?   So, would PS4 have Kingdom Hearts 1 and 2 on it, like in the store? Since I don't want to go buy another system just to play those 2 games.  I know you can't but the disk in, but I'm hoping they would have it available on the store.  Does anyone know?   Eh, at least I tried, right? That's all anyone could of asked for!   I'M....TRY...ING.  IS IT... WORKING?   Dat ass indeed, brother. Dat ass indeed..   You gon' die.  But in all seriousness, I personally wouldn't sleep and head to the doc, but I am not you, and I have no control over you. Good luck.   It's insane.   Plus the Zombie knock down, needs to have a lower chance.   Now I don't want to go outside, thanks bro!   No one, literally, no one cares.  Also, why are you even stalking him?   I hate you so much....   Ah Okay!   Thank you.   Did your boyfriend beat him to a bloody pulp?  EDIT: Thanks for the Down votes!:D   I'm reading that book right now, and that's what I was thinking. :P   You're a problem in the world..   Hurts, so much.   It doesn't work. There is no point and I hate it. If anything, it makes everything worse..   I helped a girl out of suicide, but when I've needed help, she just ignores me and says that I'm doing it for attention. It's sad cause I was the only one to give a shit about here and then she turns around and kicks me away.  It's sad, really, really, sad.   I think you can get addicted, but that's just me.   Happy birthday.  I had my birthday on the 12th, I wish I wasn't here as well. I had gotten out of my second time in a mental/behavioral center for suicide. I even attempted on my birthday in 2012, I just don't care for life. It's boring, and they're making me do out patient shit, which is just large group therapy.  Happy birthday though. Good luck with your life.   Idk, torrent maybe? Not on a Computer so I can't say 100%   That explains your name.   Wow you tried hard.   [Watch this and you'll get it](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQ-8IuUkJJc)   And the joke went over your head, and you got upset. Okay. Coolio.   But yaaaay, you got food!   What is this, a picture for ants?   That they do, they taste exactly the same as how I remember them. :)   I missed them too!   Yes, yes it is.   Oh, I do. I do. ;) It's so good.   User [poop_dragon](http://www.reddit.com/user/poop_dragon) deserves an AK for all these boxes on Oreo O's! :) Thanks buddy! :D      :D Thanks buddy.   I was just about to ask that.   CAPS LOCK IS CRUISE CONTROL FOR COOL.   You and me are the exact opposite then and I have a great PC...   lol... everyone? http://steamcommunity.com/app/6060/discussions/0/810923580610540802/   Been a day, no key.   Oh... Yay SARS.   I find it cute she sent you a present and wants to chat, plus she needs it if shes deaf and schizophrenic. Happiness all around! C:    Too soon.   The sister is stupid. "She won't have a DNA test cause she knows it's him."  I know you must miss your brother, but come on..   Thousands and thousands, eh?   It's okay, its just my sad mindset   I'm not glad. lol :)   Ah, I had taken 40.   ODing by Antidepressants, just like me. How much did he take if you don't mind me asking?   I would love Rainbow.  You have no idea what a Rainbow Team Captain would do to me.   Oh so jealous, I'm waiting on my exchange from SK atm :D Can't wait.   This guy.   It's eye and mouth expression make it adorable.   Hahahaha   R.I.P   Don't think fairies can get any smaller.   Fuk off   Faries b tite. Makn wishes n shet   Wot rong wit gayz? Dey chil m8, woldnt mind bn' 1 m8   Cme @ me mate I rdy.   U wot m8?

I said to myself, it can't be that bad..  It fucking was. It really fucking was.   just whitelist the website?   Not that's "K"   Why do I go to this subreddit.   Dude.   Not today with this comment.   You lost all the upvotes you gained. And then some.   Oh.  	109
 Spank bank material.   Yep.   If they know they exist, like you're not banking overseas or in some strange location....once they have a death certificate they can pretty much get any information they want.  Went through this when my grandmother died and the crazy aunt started getting into things, she got access to the stuff faster than my parents did, even though my parents were handling my grandmothers finances at the end.  They are SUPPOSED to follow the directions of any will you might leave, so that might be a better idea to get sorted out.   Recently turned 36.  For years now I can't even picture a future where I think I'd be happy.  I can easily picture worse things to come.  When I go into a job interview and they ask me what Im passionate about, I have to try to make something up and try not to laugh at the absurdity of the question.  Lately I've been thinking about just giving away everything I own (not a whole lot) and just walking away from life.  I kind of think it's a fancy way of saying kill myself, but I don't know........there's some CHANCE there once everything else is gone maybe.    Or that I need something horrible to happen to me, to give me a reason to feel bad that makes sense to other people.  If you're just a worthless lump trying to slowly climb your way out of the dark pit by getting a job, trying to find someone who likes you, etc....it's pretty hard to describe to normal thinking individuals why you haven't been working on your skills or whatever else.  Plus I would find it hard to trust someone whose mind is essentially betraying them if I were hiring a depressed individual like myself.  That there is when I start wondering what the point in continuing is, because I feel like I bring misery to everyone around me plus myself often enough that suicide might be tough...but they could move on and I could be done if I could just convince myself and pay for the costs associated with it somehow.  Some kind of terminal illness would solve it.    I am interested in what you have to say and would like to subscribe to your newsletter.    Fresco, looks like a Fresco to me.   They only care if you average X number of hours a night as far as I know.  I used to have a lot of days where I stayed up over 24 hours so I never used the machine on those days.  I wouldn't worry about it too much.  People get sick, if you dont have alternative masks to use and can't breathe through your nose..ain't much to be done about it.  BUT, if you run into the nose issues in the future, my experience is using some kind of saline spray or neti pot to get your nose open and then turn your humidifier up to see if it helps..if it's worse then turn it down to try to dry you out.  Usually turning it up is the solution to most of my nose inflammation issues.   Alcohol affects your sleep, makes your apnea worse.  Chances are certain pain medications will do the same thing.  They say 15 pounds requires a re-titrate for your apnea....  But if you have apnea caused by your brain, unless the pain medicine is causing it as a side effect...I don't see you being able to stop using the machine.  Different masks can make a big difference, but you might also need to get another test if it's been awhile.  I know I had a thyroid condition and diabetes that got treated and it drastically changed my apnea pressure levels, and I felt like shit prior to getting everything addressed.  Might be something else happening.   Everquest 2 was a decent looking game, I was in the beta...it played pitifully for me.  Maybe debugging, maybe hardware...been long enough I dont really remember what I had at the time.  But I was really disappointed the game was called Everquest considering how different it was.  I came in with an expectation and it was like everything got thrown out the window.  To this day when I go back to try it.......I still really don't see the similarities.  And find it to be rather odd and clunky to play considering it's the "more modern" version of Everquest compared to other MMOs of it's time.  It kind of goes to a line of thinking, that if they had just themed it anyway else and called it something else I probably wouldn't have been so hard on it.  Same with SWG, it has some really unique systems and such but never really felt "Star Warsy".  If it didn't have to measure up to Star Wars, it would have been a pretty unique and fun to play game that would probably have lasted longer.  Which was one of the points SOE said they were addressing by only using their own IP going forward........but they really didn't cut down on the hype and overpromising that pissed me off so much.  You buy in thinking, well it's good enough NOW...but when they get XYZ it's going to be awesome.  And then you finally realize they duped you again.  Eventually you have to stop rewarding that behavior and call them on the BS.     And considering they are one of the few, if not the only MMO development house that could potentially run smaller MMOs with unique systems that would appeal to the "tired of the same old" former/less enthusiastic MMO players now it just.........wears on me to see them continuing to abuse those players instead of trying to cater to them.    Star Wars Galaxies.....there's a CHANCE that LucasArts killed that game.  I've always heard they insisted on NGE.    Matrix Online.....bought from a failed run.  Vanguard.....that got McQuaided.  But the ones I mentioned, those are entirely SOE driven.  So their comments and promises are within their control.   While I don't care about H1Z1, since the announcement is mostly here......  I'd just like to point out that SOE announcements have a history of basically blowing smoke up your ass by using language that is very non-specific.  Current path of development and operation could be that they were PLANNING on more micro transactions and it was unannounced yet.  Get some hard promises out of them with specific language so it's not 6 months down the road and you're 100-200 dollars in when you find out they don't intend to honor what you THOUGHT they meant.   Planetside 2 has basically rotted on the vine versus what Smedley was spit balling the game could turn into.  It has lost so many players because of the lack of progress..... buying the same weapon half a dozen times is .......just silly.  And the whole MLG bend, waste of time as it just doesn't appeal to a mass audience.  They never added resource collection or anything that doesn't focus around the FPS aspect despite loads of comments on it, etc.  Planetside 1 last time I played had people obviously cheating, using vehicle immunity hacks or hacks to take the spread out of their weapon shots for pinpoint firing while holding down the trigger.  I'd bring up Everquest, but since it was new and people didn't know what they could expect...I can forgive some BSing there.  Then it continued with Everquest 2......all that voice work that no one wanted and a complete redesign of the Everquest world and classes that was like a game with Everquest name tacked onto it.  Landmark, while interesting for building, just lacks the basic "life"/spark of minecraft.  Haven't heard much of anything about Everquest Next in a long time....so you have no idea what they plan on doing with it.  Only person worse for bullshitting people is McQuaid.   Just curious if you would elaborate on the field of information security.  Day to day stuff you might do, etc.  I see it listed fairly often in federal job listings.   If you have a cold/allergies sometimes I'll think it's my CPAP for a bit.  Otherwise.....not using the humidifier gets me sinus issues which comes off as a headache at times.  Usually when I had headaches due to lack of untreated sleep apnea, it was above my ears and high on my head on the sides.  If you can tap your forehead and around your eyes and it hurts, that's sinus pressure from something.   I think it's only federal positions allowed to post there.  And most of those spend the year on hiring freezes with little spats of unfrozen time to hire.  So they have A LOT of applications to choose from when the time comes to pick.   But to give you some idea of generally how a lot of government hiring goes.  Boss A hires Friend A, B, C, then and hires Stranger D, E, F.  Those friends are going to be put in any and all promotions Boss A has any say over.  And if Boss A moves up and out of the area, Friend replacing Boss A ends up acting just like him and hiring Friends to pass through the system as quickly as possible.  While everyone else not considered a friend can sit and spin unless they are willing to raise holy hell with the anti-discrimination guys to get people looking more closely at the nepotism going on.    Basically, I'm saying if you've worked in the real world only "private sector or way less fucked up public sector", you're going to be really pissed to see how it operates in federal positions unless you are working at the higher pay grades.   Although if you're bent on getting in, some of the bases use outside companies to do on-base work...and it's a good way to get the basic clearances and a leg up on outside of the system applicants.   You have some beautiful tits.   I've ordered stuff from Cpap.com without issue.  I don't know if they are the best on prices, but they had a decent selection.   Right, but you don't own the thing yet.  So he has no way of knowing what it will be like.  Like I said...they make A LOT of masks and products to make it more tolerable to partners.  And to be honest if you snore, I really doubt the rhythmic sounds of the machine are going to be MORE annoying than random gasps and gurgles during the night as you toss and turn during apnea events.  If it's SEEING you in it, then that's one thing.  If it's the NOISE, I doubt it will be a problem for long.  If it's something else, you need to figure it out.  End up with heart problems later in life if you dont get apnea taken care of due to the blood pressure spikes all night long.  Surgery is not very effective, and operations on your mouth are really quite painful to endure for not getting real nearly sure-fire results.   Unless there's some other weird reason, it sounds like he's just over-reacting to it.    Unless you are sleeping in a room that is crypt quiet, people usually dont notice the machine running.  And if they do, they just put it above or below the level of their head to block the little bit of sound it makes.   If the mask is noisy, they make a lot of masks now that are made to diffuse air better.  Or come with cotton filters to cut down on the noise.  Get the machine, use it and see how much better you feel.  Then figure out the sleep arrangement....there's a lot of options to be had to make it more tolerable.    Or just get to feeling so bad that you bitch at him all the time due to it.  Have noticed in quite a few people how much more tolerant they are once they've been on CPAP awhile.   As long as the dawn is anti-bacterial it's fine.  I use orange scented.  Don't soak your hose if it's heated.  Just put a drop in the non-connector end.  And stick your finger in the connector end to block the water and swish it back and forth.  Dump and repeat to get the majority of the soap out..  To me, the hose is the hardest part to wash and dry because of how it's made.    Just try to get in the habit of doing it once a week, if you miss it's not the end of the world.    Really not much to screw up about it.  Just take the cloth part off your mask...and if you have a heated hose....you need to take care not to get the connector end wet.  Soak in dawn dish soap for the rest and rinse it off, wipe down with a dry cloth.  Done.  Most the masks are two parts, and the water chambers are two parts...  The filters can go longer..but they are super easy to clean (white ones you throw away when they start showing signs of build up and replace with new, black ones can be washed).    They recommend to clean it each day, dumping any remaining water.  However if I have a significant amount of water left I let it go another night then dump it.  Mostly because some nights Ill barely use any water...and others Ill use a lot due to weather and humidity changes.  But I just hate dumping out a near full tank.   If you clean it regularly each week....and you're not letting it sit over 48 hours...     Shrug.  Can really go crazy cleaning this stuff if you feel the need.  But I think my way strikes a decent balance for me.    Little late to respond.  But I have asthma, and when I was first put on CPAP.....6-7 years ago.  It was really hard for me to relax on it and I felt like I had to breathe faster.  Most machines back down pressure when you exhale, which is a tremendous help.  So make sure that setting is on for sure.     Then you need to get used to slowing down your breathing so it doesn't feel as suffocating.  I started taking really long in and out breathes like your doctor asks you to do when they listen to your lungs to exaggerate it...and you can feel how much easier it is to breathe on the machine when you do that.  Annnnnnnd while I've been on CPAP, I was put on Asmanex (inhaled steroid) which has virtually stopped my need for rescue inhalers.  Every so often I'll need the rescue inhaler when the allergies really start kicking in.  But generally I take the steroid inhaler maybe once a day or once every two days depending on the weather and how I'm feeling.  I think I can go up to like 2, maybe even 4 times a day according to my doc.  But really haven't felt the need.   Ever since they took the CFCs out of the asthma inhalers, I've felt like the rescue inhalers don't work as well.  They don't puff as hard, so when you're really struggling for breath you need to hit the thing 3-4 times to get what 2 puffs on the old CFCs used to do for me.  But that's one of those hard to judge things since Im older, etc.    I put that out there because I never have felt like the rescue inhalers really cut it for me for quite awhile, so something to consider if you're in the same boat.   Distilled water gallon jug is about a buck a gallon and lasts me over a month per bottle with my new heated hose-humidifier machine. It's WAAAAY more efficient on water than my older machine.  They recommend not using tap water because it can smell due to the chemicals used in it.  And can affect your lungs if you're sensitive to them.  Vinegar will remove build up in the water chamber if you don't use distilled.....maybe do this once a month.  And you should clean the parts of your machine weekly (mask, chamber, washable filter (black one), tube).  I usually soak my mask and chamber in dawn dish soap in as hot of water as you can manage.    The tube if it's heated can't be submerged on the plugin side, so you put a drop in and plug off the plugin side with your finger and fill it from the other end a couple times.  And washable filter, I just rinse it under the sink...mostly to get any dust trapped in it out.  You can rinse your water chamber daily with a drop of dish soap if you are really concerned about germs, etc.    	23
 I don't think I ever noticed that!! You, dear potter head, are awesome!!!    And I would be honoured to be among those numbers alongside good brothers and sisters    Oh yes. It's real to us.    So I'm rereading the fourth book for the 400th time. And I'm at the graveyard with Harry. And I noticed something. One of the trees mentioned is a yew tree. And voldemorts' wand is made of yew. Thought it was an interesting little tidbit!!    Welcome home, friend!!   I like this idea. This one seems like the most likely to me.    Is anyone else curious as to how a howler doesn't explode en route? Like, what kind of magic is used for that? What if a howler had to be sent to somewhere like Bulgaria from England? Just thought of this!!    Not all the trials are present before getting to the sorcerers stone.    And this is what I was trying to point out :) thank you.    Think about it. JKR says that the process for making a Horcrux is difficult and time consuming. If we hold this to truth, then how was Harry "accidental"? Voldie would've had to have had this planned out, correct? Share your thoughts!!  	10
 Omitting accurate information in general   Unless someone's showing a project they're working on for class.       When you get home, all you will have to clean up is your suitcase. Dishes are done, floor is swept, and trash is taken out. This is the best Advice Mallard I've ever seen.       Found out I have depression after suffering from it for at least 10 years. Tried to tell my mom to watch out for my younger siblings, but she told me that I have nothing to be depressed about and I need to stop being so dramatic.      	7
 I had the same issue with Adrafinil... I have no clue what to do, and I don't want to turn to amphetamines again...   i'm saying in a suitcase that you dont carry on should be pretty safe.   Does moda do the same thing? Or is it more of a stimulant?  	3
 Lol Thanks. Like a lot of people who got bullied I had develop a sense of humor as a defense mechanism, both for them and me. They punch softer when they're laughing.    Thanks. One of my friends cut the trailer together, think he did a pretty awesome job.    Repost from earlier reply: That's what I was initially diagnosed with a year ago. At the time it was atypical because I could sleep and find some joy in day to day life. Less so now.     Acting is what I'm weaker at, I'll probably be doing more writing/directing. Thanks for the good thoughts!   That's what I was initially diagnosed with a year ago. At the time it was atypical because I could sleep and find some joy in day to day life. Less so now.    And you as well  *looks at user name*  I think...   Nope, I'm down south.    It pretty much goes Friends/family, Dog, complete strangers, unit, corps, God, Country, then me.    Lol. It only goes so far, but it's fun when it works.    Appreciated, working on moving towards bigger and happier things.    That's great! I hope to get there one day. The good days are getting very slowly more frequent on the pills, hopefully one day I'll be able to get it without the pills.    Thanks for asking!   Oh not at all.  I'm finishing up a degree in Theatre, but I'm going to be pursuing a film career. As for work work, I work in the customer service field in a call center.    Ok, I think I see what you're saying. I'll definitely look into that. Thanks.    *Honest reply redacted due to being typed at work*   What I thought was the proper definition was wrong. I looked it up and realized my mistake. I will be clarifying it with my doctor the next time I see him so I can speak with the proper level of information on the subject.    A couple people have said they don't think they'd pull through, but I still say you'd be shocked.   Honestly the stereotypical emo description really works best. It's like you're walking down a long dark tunnel with water up to about mid-shin. It's cold, clammy, uncomfortable at all times and all you want to do is just lay down and not feel that anymore. After a while, that becomes your reality and the cold clamminess almost supplants the concept of the warm blanket. It's almost comfortable.    Everyone thinks I'm quiet when in reality I just don't unleash the full crazy until you know me well enough not to call in the guys with the butterfly nets.   I read this after another d-bag had called me a faker and didn't read the don't. Then I was confused by the rest of your post. You're the politest troll I've ever met.   Kidding aside, thanks a lot, I appreciate that.    I'm starting to look at meditation and lucid dreaming. Also reading into some Buddhist ideals. Is that kind of like what you're talking about?   I'm 22, fat, white, with bad knees and back from spending a good deal of time inside lockers, this was my only option.    Hopefully they will/are. Medication is starting to help.    I saw there was a post about what redditors have depression on the front page and I thought I'd get discussion going. There's a difference between starting a discussion on a website where no one knows who I am IRL and seeking attention. I'm not walking around with a Double Depression sandwich board.    Yes I'm currently on Prozac and we'll see about adding that/switching it up as time goes on.    My only regret is... that i had... boneitis.    Running after pay day when I can afford them. Running the full spectrum.    Will do.   When I'm in a room with more than eight people my hands start shaking, it's not a matter of just punching through a case of the sadsys, there's something chemical in my brain that makes me sad/lonely/anti social that I can't correct with thought power.    Is that where not only do I go free, but the state give me 50k to send someone I dont like to a mental ward?   That was a many layered comment. Have an upvote.    Thanks! Doing my best. This is helping honestly.    The difference being those people slogged through X number of years in misery while I have a chance to live out the next 50 happy.    That's fine, I'm up for anything at this point. I'm not crazy about the idea of whether or not I remember to take a pill being the difference between happy day and struggling to get off the couch.    I know at the clinic they have a neuro psych department, but I don't know much about it so was just following the familiar roads.    Not gonna lie, it's a fun way to get out of shit/ask for favors.   "It's your turn to do the dishes" "But I have double depression!"   Yes, when he used those words I started laughing hysterically. I think he might have been inching towards the phone to call in the guys with the jacket.    Thank you!   You'd be surprised what you can handle but thank you, I truly appreciate that.    Lol. It would be much appreciated. Have a pretty small acting role, but put in a shit ton of work behind the scenes, and I'm really proud of how it turned out.    Yeah, that was really unnerving and I'm hoping it doesn't re manifest.    Ok   Just hold on to the positives that you can and know that you are a beautiful person and people do love you. When you're ready, you really do need to seek some help, we can only do so much. But until you are ready, we are more than happy to do all we can.    Reference to the it gets better campaign last year. I'm straight but I took it for the purposes of that point.   	43
 Thank you! I actually did this and it helped a lot! :)   Thank you! I didn't really do as well as I'd hoped...but I should be alright!    Me too. Like right now.   Does it have to be Jesus? I'm not confident in how much he knows about International Relations and political theory.  	4
    [Here you go.](http://stream1.gifsoup.com/webroot/animatedgifs5/1978595_o.gif) Makes me cringe a little for the girl though. Yeesh.   http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTqDhySEppU  Jiffy! 00:33-00:37   Thanks!    Thanks!   Thanks for the suggestion, I hadn't thought about doing that!   Ive kinda been doing baby steps into keto, like much less carbs and lots more veggies and protein, but I still give myself some allowances sometimes instead of just changing cold turkey.   I also just finished my first year of college, and it having been summer vacation and being home really has changed a lot of things. I eat a lot less at meal times and I tend to snack less.   I try to get out and powerwalk for about a half hour a couple times a week, but I really do owe most of my weight loss to my diet.   The loss has been since probably the beginning of June, so maybe a month, maybe more?   And thank you, I really do appreciate your kind words. The problem with these pictures, though, is that they are at a slight upward angle. It is really different with better lighting, and when I look at myself in one of those all angle mirrors, I do look a little different. For example, this is a picture taken of me on the fourth of July [(I'm on the left).](http://i.imgur.com/vst2Irt.jpg) My legs look great, and I have a bit of a food baby, so just disregard that roundness, but I do have some fat left in my arms and face that I want to get rid of. And I know its possible for me to be 125 again because that's what I was a year ago at the same height! haha      How did you do it? because my starting weight is 138 as well and i want to get down to 125, and we are also the same height.   Youre my inspiration, holy crap.    Hey, I know that it's kind of late to be commenting, but as a 62 kg f/18/5'4" trying to lose about 4.5-6 kg, I have to know. Did your boobs get smaller? I really like where mine are at right now (so does my boyfriend) and I can only imagine that I would be kind of sad about it. Did yours get smaller, and how did you feel about it?   what was the music in this?    It would go nice with card that says "Eat Shit."   I usually wouldn't say anything about this, but this post made me cringe. The amount of misogyny, accidental or not, on Reddit really shouldn't surprise me, but it never fails to. "You're plus sized, but you've found a way to make yourself look more appealing for my benefit, even though your physical appearance has nothing to do with me? Good girl." Yikes, guys.   You clever bastard.   You can unsubscribe to /r/atheism so that you never have to see that again.   Congratulations! Wow, she really loves you. I don't know if I could tell my SO the same thing. I bet she is lovin' your new body as much as you do!   Dang, you are HOT.   My friend got his last name down his side, and is planning to get his mother's maiden name down his other side. It's like a tribute to both sides of his family, sort of.   Sneezing when it doesn't indicate that they are sick or when it doesnt have any foreshadowing purposes. Just sneezing.    what was the comment?    Thank you, this is really cute! Sorry I took so long to reply, I haven't been on reddit lately.   /r/mildlyinfuriating is your home, brother    Oh, duh. I'm sorry. I got all mixed up with usernames. Yeah, shoulder-length hair might be hard to do with a wand.   Your hair is definitely long enough; I have a friend whose hair is your length and I have curled it many times before. Sometimes it's hard to get the hang of it because the hair tends to slide off when you curl it, especially if your hair is freshly washed or really shiny and smooth. I'd start at the thick end of the barrel and wrap down, because the hair does slip a bit. Also, make sure you are doing it tight enough.    I love this. I wish I could give you more upvotes.   I read this and wanted to downvote something, but I wasn't sure what. Then I realized I just wanted to give Reddit one big downvote.   Random side note...you look like OAG.   I absolutely adore your natural color, so I don't think you should dye it, but If you're looking for a change, I'd say dark chocolate brown hair would look great on you, especially if you got a pixie cut. You could definitely pull that haircut off.  I'm not sure if you meant colorful as in blue or pink hair or something like that, so if you did, i think a blue-fade-to-purple ombre with a pixie cut would look great. It would go great with your eyeshadow. :)  	29
 I'm quite jealous of you. My older pig just tolerates me with no enthusiasm and my younger pig is learning from her!   I'm 18 and I usually pop by r/scotland but have recently added r/edinburgh to that.   I'll try it sometime. I went to cafe Andaluz recently which had lovely food and that was tapas so I should enjoy empires cafe too.   oh awesome! where are they all?  	4
 Thank you for clarifying which one was saying neigh and which one was talking, otherwise I would have been confused.  	1
 Awesome! It takes like 4-6 weeks to get to you. Can't wait to get mine in the mail :D   I just made one for my family. It is too cute! :D      Yeah it's the nighttime fireworks at MK.   Wishes. And crying during the Wishes.   I don't know I thought it was a good question.     I still remember being leashed. :(    That's awesome to hear! :D Thanks! [[96 DAYS :D]]   I haven't been yet, but my SO and I have reservations to Akershus in the Norway Pavilion in May and that looks pretty good. They have a cold bar that everyone has access to and then a nice looking menu you order from. The cold bar has some shellfish, cured meats and cheeses from Scandinavia. There are some wonderful sounding Scandinavian entrees as well that we are excited about! I should mention that Akershus is a Princess meal.   [Noooooooooooo!](http://nooooooooooooooo.com)   Important question re the new Bluray edition: Did they get rid of Morrison's Boba Fett redub? :/   *claps*   Yeah, that's what my W2 says, not counting SS/Medicare.   What? No wai. ;____;   It says 969.63. I'm beginning to suspect my W4 is not right, and I got lucky last year.   Alright, just me then. Thanks!   I changed jobs in 2013, but there wasn't any space between them. That is an awesome tool! Our accountant at work advised me to redo my W4 and I will definitely be using that. Thanks!   Can you claim yourself as a dependent? I have never found a satisfactory answer to that. I just learned I can get tax help through my employer so I will go that route too because I don't know how much information I feel comfortable putting on reddit. :)   Oh, okay. Thanks for explaining.   I have more student loan interest this year, because I just rehabilitated them (yay for me!). I haven't finished filing yet, but I did not pick dependent.   What else do you need? I'm new at this.   I have excellent health insurance provided by my employer, which I pay a small amount for each month. Does that cover me?   That's a good suggestion. I'll try that when I get home!   Credit! I'm sorry. That's my bad. My only CREDIT was student loan interest. I did take the standard deduction.   Background: I make less than 25K, single lady with no kids. I am not in school, I work full time for a public university. GREAT benefits.   I owe $470 on my tax return. This is a substantial amount of money for me, and it's going to decimate the small savings I have managed to put by. Last year, I got a small refund. My income and withholding, as stated, has not changed. I'm confused and sad. :(   I just put everything through a Federal Free Edition on Turbotax, and my only credit was for Student Loan Interest.   TLDR: ELI5 why it's different so I don't get pissy and mail off a bunch of pennies. Please and thank you. 3  Edit- Changed deduction to credit   You have to cancel these at least 24-48 hours in advance, so maybe someone is sitting on a reservation until it gets closer and they have to really decide which they want. Keep trying! I was able to make one last week for breakfast on May 6 so it could definitely happen! Keep trying and May the Force Be With You.   I like this idea.   Fett. Boba Fett.   Rebels is great for families. Not too scary for kids, enough stuff to be interesting to adults too.   Star Wars Land (ohpleaseohpleaseohplease)   I love it! His expression really makes the shot.    On our upcoming trip, we will have two-day passes with Park Hopper, and HS is the only one I plan on visiting twice. :D We love Disney, but we are just as excited about Star Wars!!   All of them. You can get GBA ones and play those on the Lite. Start with Fire Red or Leaf Green.    Thanks for the tip. I think that's what we have decided to do. Better safe than sorry!   I appreciate the tip! :)   Awesome!! I didn't know you could try more than one thing. :D   It is a little pricey, but I keep telling myself how many awesome benefits there are to it. :3   How was the food?   Awesome, thanks. We really just wanted to bring the hilts to wear around, since our blades don't collapse. That's an awesome story about the sonic screwdriver! :D   That's awesome to hear to hear! I've never done a character meal before, but we are so looking forward to it! Thanks! :)   Does anyone know if there is a policy on this? My boyfriend and I are going in May (and we have the Star Wars Character breakfast reserved!) and we were wondering if we could wear our sabers. Thanks! :D  They are high quality dueling sabers, but we would leave the blades in the hotel of course!!   So if we booked yesterday, the price shouldn't change, right? First time bookers here, Thanks!   Thanks I managed to arrange something and will use that next time :)   Hey guys, I have an extra samurai from set 13 that I'd really love to trade for the fencer. Please let me knew if anyone would like to do this trade! :) Thanks!   Thanks for making me cry at work. ;~;    Try an app like My Fitness Pal. It will let you know if you are not eating enough, and you can add your friends on the app for extra encouragement. I lost 40 lbs with it a couple years ago. You can do iiiiiit! :D   Ohhhhh boy movie night at u/Cheezy_fingers house!  Don't eat the Doritos, tho.   Personally, I always prefer to have my office building locked when someone is there by themselves. Anyone who is supposed to be there can get in with a keycard. I always make sure it is locked whenever I leave someone on their own no matter who it is.    Only if it is hairy arms Rob Lowe.    Totally read that as Elven Warriors    Username is appropriate    Georgia Southern fills Paulson, just sayin.      Fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuck   Well these bulldogs will not be breeding any more per se... :P      Any of them. :'(  	55
 It has "Schick" written on the case and the end of the handle. I've done some research and I think it is a Schick Krona, but not real certain. I've been lurking on here for awhile, doing research before I went and bought my first razor, but then I found this while on vacation and impulsively purchased it. Is this a good choice for a first razor, or should I look for an alternative?       I've found that keeping my hands busy really helps me. Lately, including tonight, whenever I feel restless and in need of a distraction, I grab some hemp and make a bracelet. Something about the different knots and the repeating motion is soothing and helps distract me and calm me down.   Sounds exactly like my past two days. Hope yours goes better. If you need someone to talk to, I'm a good listener.    I may regret this, but all jokes are welcome. I've been feeling down all day, so if it makes me laugh - I'm game.   I'll pick someone at 9:00pm Eastern Time   *Update  Thank you everyone for all of your jokes, they have brightened up my night. I was unable to just pick one, so I've selected ClassyAssBitch and johannvaust. I've messaged them and waiting to hear back.   **Update ClassyAssBitch has received their gift card. Still waiting on johannvaust   I tried to make some a couple years ago and forgot to grease and powder the pan. Trust me when I say that is the most important step.    I live about a mile from campus and walk, unless the weather is really bad or I'll be on campus way past dark. I hate when circumstances arise where I feel like I need to drive. I end up having to leave earlier because otherwise I won't find a spot, or students walking will cause me to sit at a stop sign for a solid 5 minutes. On top of that, there is the problem of feeding the meter every two hours so I don't get a ticket. Driving to campus really is more of a hassle than walking.    My roommate and I are both vegetarians. When we need our fast food fix we go to BK for the veggie burgers. Asking for a whopper with the vegetarian meat is my favorite.    I'm 22 and still have some servers treat my friends and I like shit because they think college kids tip poorly. I have always tipped upwards of 25% or more for good service, but if a server is terrible - I'm not afraid to leave as little as 5% tip.    I'm terrified of all dogs. I'm that person that would jump in front of a car to avoid a dog - big or small. Growing up I wasn't around dogs, and thus they make me kind of nervous. Maybe they lady wasn't breedist, just uncomfortable. Just a possibility. :)    I deleted my Facebook awhile ago and traded it in for linkedin. I'm connected to people still and in a much more useful way.    If I recall correctly, it ended when he went off to college.       Did that when I moved into my first apartment. Luckily the maintenance man was a genius and prepared for all the idiot college kids moving in and had his truck loaded with towels and some magical spray that more or less killed the soap bubbles.    One of my best experiences was at Wendy's. There was an older gentleman working and I asked if it were possible to have a sandwich with no meat. Many times I've been charged full price for a meatless sandwich. This guy went out of his way to get me a deal. Punched in the items individually and put it on a Jr sized bun, was about 70 cents and I think I had cheese on it as well.    Books.  I have a thing about owning the books I read, so I hardly go to the library. I have a favorite used bookstore I frequently visit and if I have the intention of purchasing 1 specific book, I leave with at least 2 others.  When I buy a house, first thing I'll do is convert an entire room into a library. So at least my hoarding will be in a central location?    I'm paying my own way through college. I'm a full time student and I work 35-40 hours a week. If I had the option to have my parents pay for my school, I'd accept in a heartbeat.  For the most part I'm indifferent to people who have parents that pay for their college. I've met a lot of different people in school, some that have their school paid for through loans, through scholarships, by working, or from their parents. How someone pays for school doesn't define them though. A good friend, coworkers, etc. wouldn't change how they think of you because of this.  The only time I've had any issues with someone who has parents paying for their school, is when they act spoiled about it.  As long as you don't walk around bragging about it, it's nothing to be ashamed of.   TL;DR I think they are pretty damn lucky.    I'm assuming you use a wood burning tool and then just spray it with clear polyurethane and it stays nice? Will it ever rot or should it last forever (or a lifetime)?    Did you text the number?    Thought I had it figured out, texted the number and apparently I'm not as good at math as I thought I was. Trying to figure out where I went wrong. :/    Maybe I'm reading this wrong, but were you the one to find your mother and discover she had died? As a five year old that must have been pretty traumatic and could have played a roll in not having you attend the funeral.    Glad it turned out alright! :)    I'm not an ASL major or minor, but took ASL 101 for kicks and giggles, and really enjoyed it. Had Kevin and he is awesome. I need a few more credits before I graduate in May and decided to take ASL 100 with him because I enjoyed his class so much.    As a broke college kid, I love Christmas for the same reason. That and small used book stores. I saw some people recommended going to the library, but there is something about having books of your own that feels so good.    Sometimes people cave. It's a personal choice. My family made prime rib for dinner last night. My older brother made it (an amazing cook) and it took so much will power not to eat any. Every side dish was vegetarian though, so that helped.   I've caved, I know I'm new to this whole thing, and I accept I'll slip up sometimes. My reasons for being pescatarian aren't moral reasons, so if I slip and eat meat I just start over and try again.   Tell your fiance you love him, but were really hungry and what you eat is your decision. :)   I'm sorry, that puts a damper on the holidays. Hope you have a merry Christmas and enjoy the time with your family despite grandma trying to trick you. :)    I've taken my own food with me places. All summer I kept vegetarian canned soup/pasta and microwaveable vegetarian items in my car because I never knew where I'd be when I was hungry and didn't want to burden the person I was dating with having to feed me. When I go to bbqs I always bring my own veggie burgers. I never expect someone to make accomidations for me, but appreciate it when they do. However I didn't grow up vegetarian and made this change after I had moved out on my own. When people order pizza, they generally get half a pizza with what I want on it. I'd suggest talking to your fiance's family and asking about being more vegetarian friendly. Maybe they don't understand it or don't know what to make.  	28
 Lots to do. Can't do it.  	1
 Is it just me or does tiled floor + socks + chasing cat seem like a bad idea?   Elaborate?   Please enlighten me on the correct wording of the joke as it would please you.   And I live with several engineering students, all of whom never shut up about it.    Yeah, of course it's in the USA.    How do you know someone is an engineer?  They'll tell you.    So really you're not like any of them.    The accident being that western society developed in the way that you described, and not in some other way.    No. INDIVIDUALS run the world. The fact that most of these happen to be men is an accident of western history. There are just as many men who need help for various things as women.    I've been told in the past that being called cute is actually a bad thing - it means you're passable but don't have the confidence that women find truly attractive to be 'hot/sexy.' Any women care to clarify?   Dude. Normal-shaped girl with just a leeeetle bit of belly = HOT. So much more than a flat stomach.    Amazon's amazing for posters. I got some massive and good quality musical theatre posters for like $7 (AUD) each.    I think it's supposed to be 'barefooted,' but people have a habit of dropping past tenses when they talk about concepts.   r/linguistics can probably explain these things with much more accuracy.    That's a harsh school if you got in trouble for being 37 seconds late.    How exactly did that happen? Did she force you to have vaginal sex with her?   Apparently sounding intelligent is very attractive. You should keep doing whatever you were doing.    That's absolutely awful. But since you mentioned the babysitter was female, what is your gender?   Like any scientific study, regardless of the language used to describe it.    Neither of those were really directed at you - the first obviously because you're not hideous and gross. The second means that the man in question is backing off and not displaying his (still ever-present) interest because he is getting none from the girl in return. Most guys are interested in all females they know (that meet the attractiveness of point one) all the time, and are simply hedging their bets by showing only their interest in those who respond the most. There is no 'friend zone' or non-attractiveness-related reasons for lack of interest, as there often is from the female perspective. As you're displaying a lot of interest (I certainly hope you are) you don't have this problem.    There's really no such thing as a male initiated friendzone. It's either a) I don't want to bang her because she's unattractive or b) she displays little interest in banging me right now, so I'm shelving the project until further budget of interest is acquired.    I'm agreeing with now that you've specified your answer to mean in the realms of sexuality and attractiveness. Your first was a little too broad - and, honestly, came off as very sexist - which is why I think people were offended.    Well laa di daah   It is so much vastly easier for women to be attractive than men.    Please elaborate on how this could be possible?   most men do a better job with children  Can you elaborate on this for my curiosity please?   That being said, don't let sex become your only goal - regardless of your morality, I've seen plenty of advice on here that aiming for sex alone in a night (and not just to have fun) will ruin your game long-term   Which means the only direction is up.    TEN POINTS FROM GRYFFINDOR   As Achilles, I can confirm this.   Implying sex is the only goal and the only worthy conclusion   Or unless laws make the risk outweigh the reward.    Which would be like teaching that green shells are the only shells, and scientists developing blue shells are demons trying to corrupt you.    In all seriousness, who has such self confidence that they don't compare themselves to anyone else, or are ever jealous of somebody's looks or abilities? It's not possible, and a little bit of self introspection and humility can be healthy.    Four of my five roommates happen to be female with boyfriends, and the one dude is out right now. So I'm no sure that would go down too well. But thanks for the suggestion.    I'm naked right now, so thank you   Some places have preschool before kindergarten.    No, you were already downvoted.    He's just jealous because he's a 13 year old that won't have sex for a loooong time.    By the number of perfectly acceptable posts I saw on 0 at the bottom of the thread, I'm guessing some prudish prick is downvoting everything involving underage sex.    Wait wait wait... you say you were a *virgin* the first time you had sex? Wtf?   I hate to sound like Skittles11, but could you elaborate on how oral sex happened at 7?!   I'm gonna go ahead and guess that happens because it's funny.    Does this extent to all substantial facial hair, or just the bushy variety?   Shy people and introverts don't 'hate' people. They occasionally need some space, and don't like loud, hyper-social environments.   This does not mean that they are sociopaths.    That is the stupidest fucking thing I've ever heard.   Please, do explain how do you came to this conclusion.    Are you saying that shy people are mentally unstable?   I saved the comment, just so I never forget   Thank you!   Like you?   And you're really fixing that with your mature and constructive response.    Confident people can have self-doubt. Self-introspection is often the difference between confidence and arrogance.    I'm going to dispute you on unattractive girls being able to win men with confidence. I personally don't find confidence as a positive or a negative, and I know plenty of men who prefer shy girls. I would have no problems 'finding a reason to say yes' to an unattractive girl who approached me.    Post-orgasm, after we've laid there and chilled for thirty seconds, I always flip her over and give her a back massage. She says it's incredible. I'm pretty sure she now has sex with me just for the backrub.    If he has that little confidence in himself, of course she's going to look for better options. It's just unattractive.    The guy just sounds jaded that he is no longer attractive or putting enough effort into a relationship to keep her attention. Not only is this his fault, but it also goes both ways - women should thus be equally worried about men using their smartphones to find better options. So, as always, what it comes down to is not becoming complacent and taking your significant other for granted. Regardless of whether it's the 2nd century or the 20th.    - Rob Thomas   And boring. All their good jokes have been used up.    HI THERE!  FTFY   inb4 countertenors, castrati, and anyone singing in falsetto    I got better.    Do you know what 'delenda est' means?  Cato the Elder is turning in his grave.    I am both aware and a user of reddit on my phone. But thank you.    Hah, GAAAAY   This is what I struggle with the most about r/seduction - the ideal presented, and what women seem to find attractive, is frankly repulsive to me. I actually want to be a nice guy. I want to help people. I want to be friends with them. I DON'T want to spend every second of my life being superior, or a 'leader,' or the most aggressive caveman. I sure as hell don't want to treat women like objects.   I've spent a fair bit of time here trying to reconcile the two philosophies, without much success. If I remain celibate for life and not a repulsive douchebag, so be it.    After the open-ended question, ask more questions to uncover specific details. Then share something related about yourself/your viewpoint on the subject. Rinse and repeat.   E.g: what did you do this weekend? I went skiing. - I didn't know you like skiing. How long have you been doing that for? - was it fun? Any exciting stories? (moderate effectiveness depending on what you're actually asking about) -  where did you go? What was it like there? - is skiing hard?  Then:  - the last time I went skiing, I nearly got eaten by a carp. Crazy, right? - I've heard a lot about skiing but never tried it. What about it is so fun? (great question if the person is really passionate about the given topic) - my wife loves skiing. You should go together sometime. - have you tried (skiing place)?  These all vary according to your level of knowledge of the subject, but a good rule of thumb is that if you don't know what they're talking about, encourage them to explain and teach you. If you do, share expertise/viewpoints/stories etc. Learn further. Note that it is **very** important not to talk too much about your own perspectives, especially when talking about something like politics.    This is about as erotic as the American Idol auditions.   Grammar  Which brings me nicely to **VIII**: Thou shalt critique the spelling of others in a 19th Century German Facist manner   Does she ignore you or not talk to you? The difference is very important.   If you're trying to talk to her and she is being noncommittal, one word answers, trying to get away etc - ignoring you - then she is clearly not into you at all, and asking her out will only lead to great embarrassment.   If she just doesn't come up and talk to you because you're not that good friends, or because she has higher priorities (other friends that you mentioned) then there's nothing wrong. She just doesn't know you well enough to have a reason to talk to you. While a lot of people are advocating to straight up ask her out, and this attitude is definitely what you need, I'd still advise testing the waters a little bit - find some reason to make conversation with her and see how she reacts (ask her to help you with some schoolwork etc). If she responds in a friendly manner - and not in the way I described in the first paragraph - all signals go. Balls to the wind, ask her out, and hopefully she says yes.   If she politely turns you down, don't be offended. You're not right for each other and she knows it. The same applies for if she is properly ignoring you as above. If she rejects you nastily, then she's a Class A bitch that you definitely don't want to be with, and you've just dodged a bullet.   Good luck!  	67
 i self harmed in 2012 but stopped. i am now having thoughts and urges to self harm.    that sounds really cool. what do you study?    without antidepressants his libido is completely normal. its a side effect of the medication.    i like to go to rock gigs. i watch movies at the cinema. i listen to music. i collect film cameras. what are your hobbies?    i can text.    i started crying as soon as he started to cry.    yes you can be my penpal.    i have no friends.  i disabled facebook.  i am an introvert. i have depression.  i need someone to talk to.    i go to all sort of things alone. cinema, concert, restaurant. you go.    i go to rock gigs alone. i sometimes go to the cinema alone. i go out and eat alone. its kind of refreshing and independent.   	10
 ew   Pitch Perfect and Frozen are currently my favourite musical movies. But my favourite musical I've seen live in Wicked, I hope one day they make a movie version with the original broadway actors/actresses   No surprise there    Seriously? Out of all the movies to pick from a woman got jail sentence for overdue VHS rental of ''Monster in Law'' LOL girl you could of done way better.    Poker House Not many people know about the film, but it's one of Jennifer Lawrence first films she ever done, Chole Grace Moretz and Selma Blair are in the film as well.  The scene that broke me was when Agnes (Jennifer) confronted her mom and the pimp. It was so sad because she has a gun in her hand and she's trying to get her mom to listen but she won't. Also if you watch the movie, you feel sympathy for Agnes character because she has to take over the parent role even though she's still in high school because her mom has drugs and alcohol problems. Another sad thing about the whole movie in general, is that this story is based on the director childhood life which is really upsetting because a few scenes were heartbreaking to watch.   Ryan Gosling- Crazy Stupid Love   Unnecessary sequel     I feel like whoever did the casting, focused more on casting big name actors/actresses than casting less big name actors/actresses who probably are more believable.    My bad, I was too lazy to write the whole thing. Sliver Linings Playbook. Garden State was a really good movie.    Iron Man 3   The Butler. I'm sorry the way how Oprah character died, was poorly done and ruined the movie for me.    I just saw it recently, reminds me of SLP. Even though GS was released before.   1channel and solarmovie good sites to use   Sliver Linings Playbook, Away From Her    But Lawrence still nailed it though. I wonder if Anne would of stayed if she would of been nominated twice    I suggest Poker House    AH was overrated    I don't know about the other years, but last year it happened. Jennifer did not win the BAFTA, but she won the Oscar.    I'll be honest, I'm a big Jennifer Lawrence fan. I have seen every film she has been in. I thought she deserved the BAFTA last year in Sliver Linings Playbook then this year. Good performance in AH, but her SLP was way better. I hope Lupita wins.    Netflix    Too many good movies released on Christmas Day!    Way Way Back, Her    Pitch Perfect    Does TV Movies count?  The Perfect Boyfriend The Boy She Met Online    Frozen, I know it's Disney but I'm telling you it's amazing plus Let it Go will be stuck in your head for the rest of your life. Not your typical disney movie.   Way Way Back- Great cast- Steve from The Office, Toni Colliete, Liam James etc. Has a mix of comedy, drama and romance. Movie from a 14 year old perspective.   Catching Fire- Dark intense compared to the first movie. Lots of character development and more entertaining.    Having a relationship or not doesn't mean you won't be able to enjoy the movie to the full extent because you haven't been in a relationship before. Spectacular Now I heard a lot of great things about it, if you like a coming of age romance then sure I would recommend seeing it.    FROZEN    The Way Way Back (2013) indie film. I was feeling like shit, but I left the theatre with a smile on my face.    No more drugs   Life sucks., but it is up to us to determine what we want to do. I know what it's like to wake up every morning and having nothing to look forward to. I know the feeling of how if I end my life it will all go away. But then I look around, I see my friends, my family and my dad. My dad has cancer for almost four years. Every single day, he wakes up with a smile on his face. No matter how much pain he is in he always hides it and jokes about his cancer. Why am I telling my life to you? Because I know what you are feeling and it sucks trust me. But, there is so much ahead you don't even know it. The thing is if we kill ourselves voluntary, that means we lose. And it's not about win or lose, but it's about giving up. Life has it ups and downs and there will be plenty of downs, but if you give up you will miss on so many moments. It's not worth it, trust me.    Thank you for responding. I keep on delaying going to the doctor, but I think I need to go because I want to know if this because of the news or this is a long term thing. Because if there is like a light switch that would be great because I would like to be my old self again   You should try to find a way to control your anger and find a output where no one will get hurt.    So I have been thinking about death a lot and have been since November when my dads cancer has spread. I don't know I guess when I heard the news it just crushed me. Now, people who know me think I'm this happy go lucky girl who likes to make others laugh and always smiling. The problem is that's not really me. I only do that because it helps me forget my problems. I have no one to talk to because it's rare to find another 20 year old who's parent has cancer as well. I'm not close with my sisters. My sister got engaged like a week after the cancer news and I still try to be happy for her, but I'm not. Does that make me a bad person, that I would rather watch a movie or a tv show then to dress up and go to a wedding? I mean everything seems gray now, I'm very talkative at school but when I get home I stay in my room and go on the internet  for hours. I only talk to people usually if they message me first. I have no one to talk to, I have friends but I'm a secretive person. I also am 99.9% have anxiety. I'm always worried, when it comes to driving- I did not drive at all last winter and driving a new car. When it comes to school and just every day things. So I'm getting this off my chest- if someone was to give me something that would allow me to die, honestly I would take it. I'm just not happy.     I do it! For fun, I want to post my script and ideas somewhere but the problem is I don't have in the script format    I know Pitch Perfect is getting a sequel but the plot has not been released yet. My idea for Pitch Perfect 2 is having Becca and Fat Amy lead Barden Bellas and there is tension between Jesse and Beca because they are aganist each other.    Just be yourself, it looks like you knew what you were doing. Give him your number   Hi Matt Damon,  Is there one movie genre that you haven't done in a while that you would like to do again?  Also if you respond to this, I can say Matt Damon Fucking Responded to Me    My grades are good, I get A's and B's but that is all going to change because of my teacher. I'm hard of hearing and been struggling in his class. He is old school and writes barely anything on the board. All he does is just talks which is very hard for me to listen and then have to take notes at the same time. So I raised my hand in the second class asking him to repeat something and he said he already repeated it and if I stop raising my hand I would of listen. He is so rude and he thinks the class is so dumb saying oh its so easy. Also yesterday he was ''trying'' to help a student out with a formula and he said something that he says to his dog and he told the class that. I had my complains of teachers, but not to the point where he will not help, he is so rude and he won't even put anything on the board even if you ask. I don't understand how he got hired.    Books are most of the time better the film because of many reasons. There are many times that the actors are miscast and do not represent the characteristics that were mentioned in the book. Also, the movie can only be so long and do not add a few plots from the book due to time which sometimes is disappointing because we look forward to a part of the book and it is not included into the film. The only movies that I watched that were almost good as the book was Catching Fire and the Help. It is really hard for the director and the film crew to make a movie better or just as good as the book.   	39

    I was looking for something else and I just found a story about a real life Lassie (except not a collie rough): http://animal.discovery.com/tv-shows/i-shouldnt-be-alive/videos/dog-saves-injured-owner.htm    :) I really really want one. I live in a small apartment but hopefully I can move out soon into a house and get one. We also had a cat we got at the same time and they were best friends. My cat used to curl up in the dog's fur and sleep. I have a better photo somewhere - I can't find it at the moment - but I love this one of them playing together: http://i.imgur.com/EG6J8.jpg. ...though my cat doesn't really look too happy about this game hehe.   It was 12 years ago now and thinking about him made me shed a tear. He was ours from when I was a toddler and he was a puppy. Collies are such loving and loyal dogs. I went through some difficult years too and somehow he always made me feel so much better and less alone. I always felt like he knew how I was feeling and just wanted to make everything ok. You're lucky to have him. I wish dogs lived longer.    My dog looked almost the same. I miss him so much. He was my best friend for so long. He used to let me cry on him and hug him when I was sad.   It might be 40 degrees on occasion in January but usually it's not that hot - check out the weather charts. You'll be here 8 months too so will get cooler in Winter to something like what it is now.  I live near Annandale and $200 is cheap. Start looking now (just to get an idea) on www.domain.com.au for rental places. You can use the ipad app to search around UNSW if you want to. It's pretty good.   I got the flu and had similar symptoms. My muscles were really achey and my skin hurt to touch. I was really exhausted but couldn't get comfortable or sleep properly, waking up several times in the night. I was a bit restless. I think I also got a cold while I had the flu, and got really phlegmy. I got a really bad cough and it wouldn't go away. After two weeks of this, and occasionally coughing so hard I threw up a few times, I got some antibiotics. They helped a bit but it didn't just disappear. I got sick in around June and feel about 95% of my healthy self. Cough is still slightly lingering though. I think I just need more sleep.      When you do find your own place you will probably need a car to go buy stuff for it. There are a couple of carshare companies (e.g. goget) running in Sydney around the city areas, so this is handy. You can use them to pick up furniture from Ikea at Tempe or Rhodes if that is your thing. It's also handy if you want to get out of the city for the weekend. I have a friend who moved here from Sweden and he is using them as he only needs a car occasionally and he said it is quite good.      I went there in April this year. I hadn't been since I was a kid. I copied some photos for you here: http://imgur.com/a/vOeL5.  The turquoise lake is just outside the entrance Jenolan caves and is a really short round trip walk (takes about 15 minutes if you walk slow).   Just a quick couple of notes. You need a whole day down there, and you should do a cave tour. Inside the caves it is cold so take a warm jacket and good walking shoes. The road is one way down the bottom where they allow inbound traffic only for about an hour or so of the day to allow buses to get down there.   Oh and go early - especially on long weekends - tickets to some of the more popular tours book out early so you will have to wait around for your tour if that happens. I think you can buy them online (not sure?) which is probably the best idea if available.   I think it is great that you are having a positive influence on your daughters life. I don't think religion is as bad as many people make it out to be, although often people stop challenging the system of beliefs put forward by their faith, and that is the most worrying.   I agree with BlackdogLao that teaching philosophy also is a good idea. When I studied it at uni, everyone had their own input, from all different religious and non-religious backgrounds. Nobody was wrong, but nobody was right, because most philosophical issues are not that clear cut. For example, questions like "You are on a beach and there are 2 people drowning. You can only save one. One is a young person about 21 with their whole life ahead of them. One is your grandfather who may only have a few years left to live. Who should you save?". Some systems of belief teach you that you should save the person with more years to live, but of course most people will want to save their grandfather.   I am glad you have her interests at heart and it seems you are trying to provide her with a good education. When she gets older she can make her own mind up.    You know you can get a door wedge for that?   I think entitlement is one of the things that can really tear siblings apart when their parents get old.   I would prefer my parents teach me how to manage the money that I have/make, than just give me things which I did not earn. That said, a helping hand is good on occasions for the right things.    When I was really young we stayed at a motel where they put dishwashing liquid into a glass next to the coffee and tea. I thought it was a welcome refreshment and I drank it. I wish I became a human bubble gun, but I just felt really sick.   Not worth it for a lifetime of ridicule.   That's spectacular. Makes me want to go there.   See the bottom: http://www.rba.gov.au/Museum/Timeline/1991_2001.html   Hobbits would have been good. I wish I saw a show about Hobbits.   It looks like Sylvania Waters from the heli shot.   Being from the Shire I watched this show only to see what it was. I thought it might be good for a laugh but it wasn't entertaining in the slightest - none of the characters intrigued me, and there was no life story which I wanted to follow. I really don't care what happens to them. I wanted to stab myself in the eyes with a ballpoint pen. I could never put myself through another episode.    I'm from Australia. I didn't know it was called bell pepper in a lot of other places until today. :)      hehehe cute cat :) He/she has getting in the box down pat, just not the getting out part :P    I am currently suffering in really cold air conditioning and searched for topics about air con :P   It depends what climate you live in. I went to North Queensland with 95% humidity and 35degC heat, and went on a snorkelling tour where I got heatstroke. And since the water was 26degC it wasn't even cooling at all. I had to go hang out in the shopping center because it was the only place I could get cool in the aircon.   But being back in Sydney I could easily go without air conditioning. And I actually I find it to be too cold most of the time, especially since every part of the office seems to get different amounts of cold. I also find it circulates all the sicknesses throughout the office and that tends to be worse when it's cold air than hot air.  In the end especially in shared spaces, I would rather have neither. I would miss heating a little bit, and I would miss air con a little bit, but only at the mid-winter and mid-summer days of the year. The rest of the time I'm fine, and since everyone has different preferences for hot/cold it's hard to make everyone happy. At least if nature sets the temperature we save on energy costs/waste.   I'm in Shanghai. My flight was actually due out tomorrow (Sat 7th Aug) night but it looks like it will most likely be delayed. I have never been through a Cyclone/Typhoon/Hurricane. I'm in a 12 storey apartment building. I know the basics, like fill the bathtubs with water, get drinking water, non-refrigerated types of food, batteries, torch and radio.   I'm not sure if I should go to the airport or not - I plan to try to clarify closer to the flight time, but I want to ring in the morning because they will probably be flooded with calls tomorrow afternoon.  I'm expecting lots of rain, power outages and closed shops.   Is there anything else I should do to prepare/be aware of?    I would be interested in the answer to this. More the un-homelessing part.   More [here](http://forum.santabanta.com/showthread.htm?t=196766)   Depends if you want to go on a weekday or weekend and what time, and I don't know your price range but I just thought of a couple of places I've been off the top of my head you could look up in the cbd:  * Max Brenners near Wynyard station * GPO cafe (not sure of the name) - There's 2 inside * La Guillotine behind Town Hall (actually a restaurant) * Lime Cafe * Boy Charlton Poolside Cafe (http://www.poolsidecafe.com.au/cafe/home/) - good on a nice day  Also try this link for more: http://www.citycafes.com.au/Sydney_cafes    I did this a lot after I got a new fridge. I kept misjudging how far out the door came and my toes would get jammed under the door between the door and floor as I opened it. I think if it got the big toe it would've stopped the door from opening, so I'd have to be in the perfect little toe stubbing position for the fridge to cause any damage... and it happened a lot.    I don't know much about bullying or what to do about it but this site seems to have some good advice: http://www.jaredstory.com/bullying_whattodo.html      I wish I had a maths teacher like you. I also wish I was a better maths student in High School. I used to play up a bit cause I didn't understand some of the concepts so to entertain myself I did other things in class. I should have just asked for help.  The gap from High School maths to Uni maths was huge for me. It wasn't actually that I couldn't do it, but that I didn't know what I missed in High School that I needed to know to learn what I was learning at uni (if that makes sense). I got my friends to tell me and I was fine. And after getting past that hurdle I actually really enjoyed Integral Calculus at uni. Second year maths was much more fun that first year maths. I now do a lot of applied maths and I love applied maths even more.   Yum   Wow great explanation.   I'd like to understand why you prefer Australia to be a UK colony?    Unless he is the Queen and he holds the highest rank. Then it works.    The UK National Anthem "God save the Queen" seems somewhat similar to the US Pledge of Allegiance in its intent.  Australia still has "God save the Queen" as it's Royal Anthem (which I actually only just found out cause nobody here uses it really, I think it's just reserved for royal visits which happen once in a blue moon). Though it was replaced as the National Anthem in 1984. I'm not sure I like the one we have at the moment either. I wish Australia didn't have someone else's Queen. We have for the most part nothing to do with the UK. Unfortunately the referendum in 1999 shows a majority (around 60% of Australia) still want the monarchy. Doesn't help that the white Australia Policy was only abolished in 1973 and official Anti-Discrimination laws only came into place in 1975, so many of the older generation have British roots. I think we just have to wait for those who like the monarchy to pass on.   Some people want to move forward, but a lot of people like to have a firm hold on the past.   That's awesome. I have a genuine respect for EeePCs. Especially how good value for money they are. It did everything I expected and more, and the build quality was excellent.  As long as you back up the data then even if you break it after being a bit rough (which I generally am with things), you can get a new one for cheap. Not that it will break that easily though...  I'd recommend checking out the new EeePC's too.    Prouds is okay. Better on sale.   What did you do to it?   Do you put it into sleep/hibernate while you move it around? Cause if not that's not too good for most hdds.   I have an Asus EeePC 1000H. I literally dropped it down the stairs (in sleep mode) and it's still working 2 years after the incident.   If you're really rough maybe you should consider a Toughbook or at least get a laptop with a ssd.      It's his brother from another mother!

He did say really fast train, though the train in his picture is not very aerodynamic. And also it's powered by steam... possibly magic steam.   That sucks. Are electricity prices up for you too? I get a quarterly bill and my electricity cost is double what it was for the same quarter last year. I think I've used a bit more electricity but I don't think I've used double.    I like pictures with movement and personality! Kinda reminds me of a [galah](http://www.mariannedepierres.com/wp-content/uploads/galah.jpg) but not pink.   The first argument brought up at least 5 times in this article point to women only being after money. Sure, there may be some women like that but there are also plenty that are not.   The second main argument is that women want to crush their husbands hopes and dreams. Seriously? Firstly it's not going to be deliberate in most cases - you wouldn't marry someone with the intention of making them unhappy. Secondly, we all have decisions to make and being in a relationship means considering their wife and kids. Just like for a wife, being in that relationship means considering their husband and kids. If you aren't willing to make those compromises then yes, you shouldn't be in a relationship regardless of whether you are a man or a woman. However there is so much to gain from a loving relationship, so you have to decide what's more important to you.  The third thing I take issue with is that the poster implies that he shouldn't need to pay child support. Maybe sometimes the amounts are unfair, and if that is the case I see the point, but why shouldn't both parents be equally involved in the upbringing of their kids?   If you really have this hatred for marriage then maybe it is best you don't marry. I wouldn't want to be in a relationship with someone that resented me.   I was wondering how you would remove these things, and thought this was relevant:  http://www.cyber-nook.com/water/Solutions.html  Maybe if you combine a certain types of filters with boiling it would be fine (or maybe you can just use a filter - not too sure).   As that site says, depends where you live and what type of contaminants are in your water.    Maybe if she stands on a chair it would work.   I was wondering though, if you were in Johannesburg would you be safe carrying that type of equipment around? Would people still take that risk? I feel like you could just get mugged at any time there.   I liked the video.   He looks like he just ate a whole business of flies! So full!   The CBD is okay but a bit more expensive not only in terms of rent, but groceries, bars/drinks. Of course it is probably more convenient if that is where you are going to be working.   In Glebe you don't have to get the tram, and personally I wouldn't unless you need to be in the city in a hurry and work along one of the tram stops (because it's expensive and it doesn't go right down into the more central parts of the city like Town Hall/Wynyard). The buses are a bit slow   busy during peak hour though I will admit - especially if you are catching the ones that go up Glebe Point Road. I think if you work in the city from Glebe, walking or biking is probably the best option (  cheapest). You can walk straight through Pyrmont and be in the city in around 30-40 mins (approx 3-4km walking). The bus is fine for most other times (rainy/cold/dark days) and taxis are usually $20 if you have a night out and miss the last bus.   Some of the other areas suggested are good too though, but it depends on what you're after exactly.   Not to say it doesn't happen - but I've never heard of anyone getting typing strain (that I know). Is there anyone here who has?  I find my problem is not that I can't type fast enough but that I can type faster than I can think... stupid brain!   I go in the shower and blow my nose into my hands and then wash it off. I find the hot steamy water loosens it up so it comes out freely.    Tilt your head to the right and look at it.   It can! Apparently! http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1293332/   Me too! My mum used to be a typist on a typewriter for the railways. Does your mum press the buttons real hard and deliberately? I saw another lady on a public computer in the shops once and she typed like my mum and I think she might have been a typist too!    Yeah it's always hard because even if they don't intend to hurt you they sometimes do because, well, they're people. And it's often people you are close to as well that hurt you the most because they're the ones whose words and actions you care about. :( *Hugs*   The result won't always be the same though. It sounds like it turned out badly this time, but it won't always be that way. You actually sound like a really strong person in that you are clearly trying hard and you have overcome a lot of things to get to the point you're at. It might be good to lower your expectations a little, take things a little slower, and of course give yourself a break if you need it, but don't give up on what you want. You will get there.   Your comment reminded me of [this](http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=depressions-evolutionary) article.    Did something happen today?   It sounds like you're trying really hard to make your life better - don't give up. It's a difficult thing to do but you can do it.   I like the ones that are slapped on haphazardly. Goes with their parking style.   Yeah I'd go for lazy as well. He probably should have put in a little bit of effort thinking up a better excuse though.   Lol yeah, on the way to the zoo I saw some rednecks and thought we were already there.   It was for a conference. It was a pretty strange place to go for my first trip there but I didn't mind it! The zoo there is pretty good for a little place in the middle of nowhere.   I met another Australian on a plane once while I was there who did it. He said his experience involved a bunch of kids whose parents have too much money, neglect them and want to send them away for the summer. He was saying he didn't really like it that much. But I'm sure there are people who experience it differently.   I'd like to see an American do this on a world map.   That's true about that. I used to think I'd like the technology there, cause when I was in primary school I had a friend who went there and she told me all about how everything was automatic. But when I got there none of that really impressed me, but I was incredibly impressed with the Grand Canyon. I was also impressed with Niagara Falls, tho I would have been more impressed if I could feel my extremities.   I didn't know it was about the politicians! Actually I didn't even know it was called the windy city until I was coming down for landing in the plane and it was really turbulent. That's when the guy next to me told me about it being the windy city. Felt like it made sense at the time.    My first destination in the US was Omaha!    Thanks! That is awesome. I didn't know about old versions of magazines on Google Books.  Also look at page 168. Made me laugh.    I managed to dig up some information that shows people are trying to do something to help those who have been attacked: http://www.newser.com/story/35103/pakistani-salon-hires-fire-acid-attack-victims.html  Pakistani women disfigured by acid and fire attacks have found a second lifeas beauticians, the AP reports. The head of a well-known Pakistani salon chain discovered 5 years ago how commonly women are maimed by crazed or spurned lovers. With the aid of an Italian surgical nonprofit, she has helped many heal and put them to work.  Yet victims outnumber the jobs: 33 Pakistani women were singed by acid attacks and another 45 set on fire last year.   (On a side note, it's good they can work, but wouldn't working in a beauty salon be pretty depressing for them?)    And to prevent future attacks in Pakistan: http://www.ethicsinaction.asia/archive/2010-ethics-in-action/vol.-4-no.-1-february-2010/acid-attacks-a-serious-concern-in-pakistan  On 26 January 2010, a bill regarding acid violencewhich would specifically target acid related crimes by providing graver punishments for the attackers and by regulating the sale and purchase of acidwill be submitted to the National Assembly of Pakistan. But this only marks the beginning of a long legislative process and it will require some time before the law is successfully adopted and effectively enforced. It will also require a strong political will, which until now, has proven inadequate, if not nonexistent. Indeed, in most of those cases, the judicial institutions have not taken stern sanctions against the perpetrators, which have often been able to walk away in total impunity. Nor has adequate compensation and support been granted to the victims.   And there are new proposed laws in some other countries like Cambodia: http://www.phnompenhpost.com/index.php/2010021632077/National-news/acid-attacks-could-earn-life-in-prison.html  AUTHORITIES will explore legislating stiff new punishments for perpetrators of acid crimes as part of measures aimed at quelling an apparent jump in reported incidents of the violent attacks, officials said Monday.  The proposal, issued earlier this month after a string of acid attacks, is among options being evaluated by a new government committee charged with decreasing acid attacks by controlling its use.    Ouk Kimlek, secretary of state at the Ministry of Interior and deputy director of the committee, said authorities will discuss parts of a draft 20-point law during a meeting Thursday, including life sentences for those convicted in the most severe attacks.  In drafting the law, the important point that I noted is punishment on people who use acid against someone to make them become handicapped, damage their beauty, or kill, Ouk Kimlek said. They will be sentenced to jail for their whole lives. If the victim is just lightly injured, then there will be a sentence of five or more years in jail.   I guess there is a long way to go still though, and even with current laws there are so many other obstacles to getting someone convicted for their crimes, and even more difficult to stop them from happening in the first place. But I am glad to see people are trying to do something.      There is one outside Broadway shopping center just down from Oportos (on Parramatta Road side towards the city) that I go to that is reasonable (I think like $30 for a womens haircut - not sure how much for a guys but I have seen men there whenever I'm there getting their hair cut too). If you're looking for it you will notice it's got mostly asian women staff. Or you can try Just Cuts in Broadway shopping center - that one is not too bad.  I went to some others in the shops and they were okay (I think $60) but one of them did a head massage, and personally I don't like it because it makes me feel a bit uncomfortable.   That is quite a walk. I have been taking my lunch and walking to work and I actually feel a sense of achievement by not spending anything unnecessary, but it does sometimes make me a bit tired.   So many women must feel like they have no options without being allowed to have an education. And those in the article who had the courage to make their own choices are more than severely punished for doing so. I wonder what sort of life they will live after an acid attack when an education is not allowed. What sort of job they will get to support themselves. I also didn't realise the number of women this was inflicted upon. I had heard of it before but thought it was rare. Very sad.   I think I am the same like that. I like 'testing' out ideas, but actually implementing them and going into that sort of detail doesn't really interest me either.  I like art too and I've always found it easy to come up with good ideas, but my technique sucks. In high school I came up with this idea and I went about painting it. One of my friends who is reknowned for copying other people's ideas did it as well. Only she painted it way better than me, and I will be the first to admit that. My idea was there but my skills aren't up to scratch. It might just be a matter of practice and finding time to do it. I went to Tasmania a couple of years ago and went for a bushwalk and noticed heaps of guys in the bush painting. It looked really enjoyable and relaxing, and I thought maybe one day I will do that.    What makes you tick, where do you want to be, what makes you happy at work, leisure or at other times?  At work I like to discover new things or create something new and see what I find. I like improving things.   My home time is much the same. For example, when I had time I liked gardening cause I could be creative and pick what I wanted to do with the space and then make it happen and the results looked nice. I like creating new things too and trying new things, though I don't always finish what I start if I find something better to do.  My leisure time ideally involves being around trees or water or getting involved in nature-based activities like surfing or snowboarding, and I love that it's always different and I find it really relaxing. Oh I guess I like sports generally that involve some kind of challenge, not like jogging straight but a team sport is good.   I actually socialise a lot with different groups of people, but if I make too many plans I can feel myself screaming inside wanting to have my own time to be alone doing things that I enjoy. It's not that I don't like people. I just also like my freedom, and when I am around people I have to be considerate of them, and can't just always do whatever I want.   I like constructive criticism but encouragement would easily work better on me. That said, I think that's the same for most people.   Generally I have poor focus but once I am interested in something I have excellent focus (particularly at the last minute).  I found my lack of focus a problem in lectures at uni until I started trying to think of questions to ask for everything. I'd try to answer them in my head or look them up and if I couldn't find the answer I'd ask the lecturer. It helped keep my mind a bit more engaged. This applies to everything now. I don't have too many problems focusing.   I'm an analyst programmer too! But only for the last 2 years. Before that I did research. I preferred the amount of control I had over my work before compared to what I have now.   I can't accept things for the way they are and go about my daily business, I have to always be improving things and making things better. I like researching about something, learning about new things, and putting my own ideas into things and testing them. I am hoping I've picked the right career but I can't think of anything else I could be doing right now anyway.       I do sometimes, and then I lick it!   A) I agree. I don't mind pressing the flush button as long as I don't have to press the tap or door handles when exiting the bathroom. I appreciate a sink with a foot pedal like in Italy, or a sensor.   C) We don't have many of those self-flushing toilets in Australia, but I didn't like them when I was in the US because I kept trying to do a poo and while I am a novice at self flushing toilets, the sensor kept thinking I wasn't there and flushing while I was pooing, splashing my bum which was gross. I didn't like that :( Is there a way to stop them from flushing against your will?   I am a fully grown adult and I want that book now.   I guess the intended meaning of the idiom is that 'it's not fair to judge apples and oranges by the same criteria', rather than it being impossible. Therefore I think that the idiom 'you can't compare apples and oranges' to be a bit vague and misleading, because you *can* compare them, on a variety of properties such as price, taste and color for example, even though, as you pointed out, it may not be fair to do so.   Nevertheless, we do it all the time with everything. We have to in order to differentiate between things and make decisions.   Ref: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apples_and_oranges  On a related note, I think that when you make a statement about your taste in art you can acceptably say 'I prefer this artist over the other artist' but you cannot definitively say that 'This artist is better than the other artist' because you are in a way suggesting that everyone feels the same way. Whether an artwork is 'better' to you really depends on how that artist has satisfied your taste preferences, which may not be the same as someone elses. So to be specific you would have to say 'According to my criteria for preference of art, this artist is better than the other artist'... or something like that anyway...   Why can't I compare apples and oranges?   Eat healthy food and try to get enough sleep. I was repeatedly sick for ages and didn't know how much difference a good diet and enough rest could make until I did it. Difference is huge.    I don't think I could stand just working for the future. I want to enjoy my life along the way.      I have been feeling this way too recently. Sometimes I find it really hard, and for a while I make progress but then there's moments where I feel like I just got reeled back to where I started. You just have to have faith that things will get better, even if you can't see that sometimes.  For now, it might not feel so great but just give yourself time, don't worry about how long it's taking, just let up on yourself a bit. This is how I have been trying to cope.  Firstly, stop worrying about the distant future so much. Concentrate on today, and making every day count. Think - what can you do today that will make you feel better? What is a positive step you can make to make the next week/month more bearable? (just to be clear I don't mean drugs or alcohol)  Next, I don't know if this works for everyone but I always give myself some time to grieve, say like 5-15 minutes or sometimes longer, whatever it takes to feel like enough. The, after I have sulked I force myself to move on and do something else. No use sulking for hours. You have to let it out but you also have to realise sometimes you're just going overboard.   Third, don't look at other people and compare yourself. Everyone leads a different life. A lot of my friends got married quite young and I am still not. I don't see myself as a lesser person, I just chose to spend a lot more time at university and so I'm just not at that stage yet. I don't really care what they do, my life isn't about what they do, it's about me. It's up to you if you want to hang out with them but if it's making you feel worse maybe you can set yourself a time limit for seeing them so you can cope with it better.   Finally, think about what you want in life. Start with short term goals. Things that will make you feel a bit better today, tomorrow, this week. Then when you feel like you can cope day to day, think about the rest of the month, then the next year. See how you go with that.   As for the girl, every time you think about her force yourself to think of something else that you like instead. She has obviously moved on and you need to as well. It's not going to help you to think about it all the time.  Everything takes time, but if you spend so much time sulking and feeling crap it will be hard for you to make progress and for things to feel/get better. These things might not make you feel better straight away but keep trying and hopefully every day things will get just a little bit easier.     :( Hug?  	95
 or she can just jump to you??   people insist this as a form of counter play lol  you can say this about every melee champion   they removed his silence (do you not read?)  also, she could be last pick (assuming not banned)   not all champions in the other 4 roles must have some form of cc to be a decent team comp  for example, people would just go that once thresh is picked, he's all the cc they would need  and you're the one that's incompetent   I'm not entirely sure on this, some sources say that the pillar doesn't  how can cait stop a kat ult??   This is about her ult, only  here is a list of champions that CAN'T stop kat's ult:  -Akali -Caitlyn -Corki -Mundo -Eve -Ez -Fiora -Gankplank -Graves -Jinx -Karma -Karthus -Kat -Kayle -Khazix -Kog -Leblanc (since she lost silence) -Lucian -Lux -Yi -Miss Fortune -Mord -Nasus -Nidalee -Nunu -Olaf -Rengar  -Rumble -Ryze -Sivir -Swain -Talon (since he lost silence) -Teemo -Trundle (?) -Tryndamere -Twitch -Varus -Vlad -Yorick -Zed -Zilean total: 41/123  champions with UNRELIABLE cc: -Ahri -Amumu (must use bandage toss to stop her; his ult does not stop kat) -Anivia (ice ball is slow, not sure about wall) -Ashe -Brand -Cass -Elise -Fizz -Gnar (must be mega gnar to stop her) -Heimerdinger -Irelia -Kennen -Morg -Nocturne -Shaco -Shyvana -Syndra? -Twisted Fate -Viktor -Xerath -Xin? -Yasuo -Ziggs -Zyra total:24/123  a grand total of 65/123 champions that cannot be picked  conclusion: just by picking kat (some might argue akali, yi and fiora but roots do stop these champions, unlike kat), you invalidate half the champion pool. Not many of the adcs (not everyone is gonna pick ashe, vayne, tristana or quinn) can stop kat's ult and because adc is necessary, we only get to choose 4 out of 58 champions and it's not even 58 as some are not viable (for example: zac, urgot and galio) and yes she has high win rate and high banning status (especially in korea, don't know about NA): http://www.op.gg/statistics/champion/katarina/  my problem with kat, not that I lost to one, is that she is the reason you cannot just pick any champion into any role and well forces picks (mainly support since the support is required to have CC just so you can stop katarina) where as sometimes I want to support with zilean and karma, for example but cannot.    how is it wrong...  -ashe -caitlyn -corki -ezreal -draven -graves -jinx -lucian -kalista -kog'maw -miss fortune -quinn(if you are going to indicate this one is not then fine it's still a total of 15) -sivir -tristana -twitch -urgot -varus -vayne   taric (maybe he is viable?), alistar (better in solo lane or jungle) and lulu(better in solo lane),  blitzcrank and soraka are binary or situational picks, for example you wouldn't ALWAYS pick blitz,  thresh (this one is a mix: some will say he's not viable, others will argue he's still relevant; I've just never seen a good one since the last sets of nerfs)  fiddlesticks got nerfed out of viability   veigar is wasted as a support  and did you not read, karma and zilean are not good picks (despite utility) because they lack cc  so that's 15 and then, not every support is viable so it's less than 15  	9
