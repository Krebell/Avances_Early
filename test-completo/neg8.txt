 Oh sorry. Bovada tournies. Real cash.    It is insane though because they will be all in with still half their stack. It isn't as if they're down to 4 BBs. They will still have a lot of chips to play with but shove every.single.time.   A player will only lose half their starting chips in a hand, and the next hand they shove pre-flop. Why is this such a common thing?      If only we were as wise as you.    At the end of the day, it remains speculation until we know for sure AND you're right, it all leads to Christ's return anyway. But I wouldn't say it's not worth wondering about. God included it in His Word for a reason, you know?   I know different sects of Christianity carry separate opinions on who or what the Anti-Christ and False Prophet are, but I was curious to hear some separate ideas. This post was inspired by another this morning concerning the End of Times. So, in being respectful with each others' views, what is your take or interpretation?   So is the one posting against their trash talk. What's your point?   Yeah, I suppose that's true. You wouldn't catch any of these guys flapping their gums in a live game.    Fair enough.   I don't know if people are genuinely unable to hold their tongue or if it is an attempt to tilt players, but the amount of name-calling and insulting is astounding. Anyone have any insight into the major motivation of trash talk? Or, if you talk trash yourself, why do you do it?   Look, I know I am in the minority on this one, but there is such a thing as too much Chris Pratt, and I'm concerned its already gotten to that point.    The Blurr belongs to Butch.

The shaky cam didn't bother me so much, and probably wouldn't have even thought to mention it, but different strokes.    May I ask what passage leads someone to that interpretation?    I would speak to a pastor about this issue. Jesus calls it adultery, but then so is looking at a woman with impure thoughts. Who isn't guilty of that? I would say if she is a believer, you're probably okay, but seek wisdom through prayer and the council of wiser men than myself.    Hey Bill welcome back!   Who's this fat man then, eh? Eh?   Okay, I completely understand the point you're making and you're 100% correct, but you don't actually believe Dances with Wolves is anything like Last of the Mohicans, right?

    I've always figured that it was one of those things he didn't want people knowing he knew about for obvious reasons. That would just give the ministry more bs to post about him in the Prophet.   It's not like Dumbledore could just hand it to them, but if he planted it for them to find. Why would Filch take a random piece of parchment from someone? He would have no clue what it was.    Yep! It's a place for scary stories and experiences, but remember when commenting, you take everything you read as true no matter how outlandish it might be!   This might seem like a weird theory, but I always thought Dumbledore might have purposely lead them to it because he believed it would help Harry in the future. I always got the vibe that almost everything that happened to Harry at Hogwarts, Dumbledore had some hand in.   No, trying to make people made is riling people up. I wasn't trying to make anyone angry. Don't know why anyone would get mad over something posted on the Internet.   I didn't want to rile people up. I wanted reactions. Not everyone was rilled up   And curious. People might have responded differently had I said it was someone else   Good! Trust me. Everyone in class just kinda looked at her with an awkward silence   Sorry if I upset you! This was a girl in my class! I thought it was absurd and wondered what others would think if it was said   Sorry if I upset you! This was a girl in my class not me.

 Was that with or without the helium?  https://youtu.be/w6UhXivPyw4   Good post. Fancy repeating for Lewis's wins?   What elephant?   In the UK there have been multiple, upheld court cases where drivers have been prosecuted for crossing red lights (by automated cameras) to let through emergency services vehicles.   Not our finest hour, and I'm sad to say that if I'm at the front of a set of lights with a camera and the choice is sit tight or get a ticket, I'm turning the radio up a notch... :-/  http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1204944/Driver-gets-60-fine-moving-yard-red-light-let-police-van-999-pass.html  (I'm so, so sorry that this is a Daily Heil article :( )   The first year can be tough, but I promise you that you won't regret it, even for a moment!   Sorry, I disagree. This quote:  "If we don't have a competitive engine in the near future, then either Audi is coming or we are out," said Marko.  ...is pretty inflammatory and doesn't really need a whole lot more blowing up.  When did you last hear someone from Williams say this. Or Lotus? Or even Marussia, FFS. Not impressed with Red Bull this year. My six year old son handles defeat better than they do. And he can sulk like a champion too!   Note: In the UK, the chances of him driving again any time soon would be pretty much zip. Unsurprisingly, we are somewhat reticent about letting people back on the road if they might fall unconscious at the wheel. IIRC, 1 month if they can find a cause, 6 months (or more) if they can't and therefore can't be sure it won't happen again.  Tough love, but it would be for his benefit, as well as those about him. He could very easily have killed someone there...next time, he might find that he's burnt up all of his luck credits already :-/  Anyone know what the situation would be in the USofA?   Apart from me. I'm fucking awesome, me.  (Sorry)   Brit reporting in - I always apologise to my car if I hit too big of a pothole.   Britain: Damn, we're good at queuing!   True, but look on the plus side: UKIP only won one seat!  Every cloud has a silver lining :-)   Also works for checking for "live" fibres when wiring SANs :-)   33 a race is "not a bad deal"!?  I'd switch sports in an instant rather than pay close to this!   Meh, I have a recorder so just watch in the evening when the kids are in bed and I can have some peace and quiet. And, as a bonus, if there's a weather or SC delay, the fast-forward button works... :-)  Only races I watch live are the far eastern ones and only then if they are on the BBC.   I find a computer to be indispensable:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=043WEs_6TAo   Chris Pratt had something to say on this subject:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fkVAAtC1mEA t=43s   Update: Lowden finished but was lapped three times by the leaders.   Alonso was also competing but his shorts exploded at the 15th mile marker. He was, however, upbeat and said that Honda were due to deliver uprated shorts in time for Barcelona.    Don't let the internet hit you as you leave...   Woohoo! I might be on the telly yet :-)   Nope. So much nope.   Sweet baby Jesus!  Didn't some kid die after filming something just like this?   And I thought I was bad for telling my kids to "man up" when they tell me they are tired during a bike ride!  I reckon I'm the world's best dad now :-)   Didn't Kvyat manage to cross the line?   Is it me, or are those wheels just downright _wrong_ for the car? They look to me to be the incorrect offset, forgetting the obvious fact that they are clearly too big!  In the UK, at least, they would be illegal as the protrude from the wheel arches and would thus be dangerous to other road users, but especially "soft targets" such as cyclists or pedestrians.   Out of all of the terrible things here, this one is the biggest NOPE by a country mile. Given me the shivers just thinking about it. Gnnn...   Does anyone have any feedback on how good, technically, this kit is?  Looking at the raincoat and softshells, which are upwards of 100, there's very little information on what they are made from. If I was buying in a shop, I'd probably expect gore-tex or Windstopper type materials at that price....  Obviously, I'd expect the very best here, especially as they are being subsidised by the sponsors' logos ;-)   In the UK, never had to have a sick note for anything less than a few days off (honestly, I can remember how long and it's been nearly 10 years since I had more than a couple off in a row).  If I put my manager hat on, I perhaps would get a little grumpy at "Morning After The Night Before" illnesses. Not because of the time off, but more because of the diligent staff that have to pick up the extra work and cover for those who aren't as conscientious.  I'm pleased to say that for the last 10 years I've worked with a great team who wouldn't dream of dropping people in the shit like this, and arguing about the odd sick day here and there would never have crossed my mind.  Treat people like kids and they'll just return the favour...   Note: if you can come to work with influenza, you don't have influenza.   Quite right too, sir!  All I saw on Sunday was a team *and* a driver who were /so/ excited to win. It was great to see regardless of which team you support.  There were no losers this Sunday.  (Well, ok. McLaren, a little bit ;-) )   *shrug*  I supported Lewis last year, but I'd be lying if I denied that a bit of me wants to see Vettel win with Ferrari.  Just because people support the sport and not necessarily a specific team or driver does not make them less of a fan...   Fait comment, but I must refer you back to the governing rule #1 in my original post ;-)   Have you tried it on the current release? It tells you that it will stop working soon. And in the dev release it's already disabled.  The problem here is that the rest of the world are moving away from proprietary plugins but Sky aren't.   EJ is a special, exclusive feature with the BBC. With a beard ;-)  I'm not quite sure why you bothered to ask the question as your response is basically saying that you've made up your mind anyway.  	33
 If you want to program locally it is best to install crouton and then install eclipse.  As for an online IDE you can try this: http://ideone.com/ but I can't vouch for how good it is as I haven't used it.   I'm not saying that there isn't a connection between the two. I do think that there is a high probability that there is some connection.  I just wanted to point out that other sports are experiencing a similar decline and that there are other possible factors in play that have led to a decline in the participation rates of those sports.   perhaps...   It's not helpful to just show info regarding one youth football league without comparing it to other leagues and other sports. There's been a general decline in youth sports, not just football.  http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702303519404579350892629229918  [Chart form the article.](http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/P1-BO944A_YOUTH_G_20140130180004.jpg)      The ref data on basketball reference just indicates the effects of the whole crew that a ref happened to be a part of.  Keeping track of individual ref calls or non calls would allows us to get a better idea of the tendencies of each individual ref.  I just think having that information would be nice and would lead to some interesting analysis.  And I don't know about the whole mob material thing, if a ref does perform poorly he/she should be criticized the same way players are when they perform poorly.     Would be nice to know the name of the official who made the call.   It's a step in the right direction but why limit it to only the last 2 minutes of close games?   I can't start elementary OS. I keep getting the error: X: cannot stat /etc/X11/X (No such file or directory), aborting.  This happened after I updated my Chrome OS.  Could the update have broken my chroot?

On the Tosihiba CB2 FHD Netflix doesn't give me any problems.  Youtube tends to stutter during the first couple of seconds and then is fine.  However Youtube videos that run at 60fps are unplayable.  EDIT:  In regards to the youtube stuttering, using magic actions for youtube, I enabled flash player playback which got rid of all the stuttering, even 60fps 1080p videos.   This is pretty cool.  Is there a an easy way of scraping the shot charts data?  I know it's possible, the guy who made [this](http://peterbeshai.com/buckets/app/#/playerView/201935_2014) was able to do it.   I was just trying to figure out how to do this as well and found the solution.  1. To change the default open the file manager app on chrome os.   2. Then click on the pdf you want to open, but don't actually open it.   3. On the bottom right of the file manager app there should be a drop down menu that allows you to select which pdf viewer to use.  You can  also change the default pdf viewer from the same menu as well.     Yes!   Glad you enjoyed. And yeap he was real bad.  	15
 [Maho's Japanese VA has pretty good english too](https://youtu.be/dhl_j6gcww8?t=5m32s). Ryusuke's VA has a thick accent but understandable enough.  It also kind of bothered me that Koyuki never bothered learning english until the end of the manga.          I got confused and thought the colonists already got annihilated but right now that's what they're trying to prevent. I believe those colonists were the group of pacifist that wanted to leave Sidonia.

That small arc was pretty hilarious.         Whoever did the GUI design for Sidonia should get a raise. Interplay between HQ and the battlefield was excellent as always, I think this is what sets KoS apart from other anime with large scale battles.  A couple of gifs:  [Tsumugi going berserk](http://i.imgur.com/A54vgle.gifv)  [Firing Formation](http://i.imgur.com/FUJJ1pp.gifv)      Just Genocidal Organ but I'm definitely planning to read Harmony. Unfortunately there's no translation for The Empire of Corpses yet. Hopefully that would come out before the blu-ray release.   Genocidal Organ was incredibly depressing. Hopefully the film can capture the oppressive and dreary feeling the novel had.   It was also densely packed with ideas relating to technology, philosophy, psychology, sociology, and politics. Even though it can feel academic at times, it was for the most part thought provoking.   The anime is [BECK: Mongolian Chop Squad](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bOgzCGtryF4 feature=youtu.be list=PLDCDA207E13E6FF9F)      Credit to /u/rber for [pointing this out.](http://www.reddit.com/r/animegifs/comments/346ror/bicycle_chase_beck_mongolian_chop_squad/cqs7a5y)      It was being pitched to HBO but now that they have True Detective I doubt they'll do another detective/mystery show like Monster.   [Funimaton has the entire series available on youtube](https://youtu.be/bOgzCGtryF4?list=PLDCDA207E13E6FF9F)   The acapella version is Cristina Vee.  The OP is by [Sugarhate](https://soundcloud.com/sugarhate)         Here's another one, an acapella cover.  https://soundcloud.com/cristinavee/cristina-vee-moon-on-the-water      The playerbase around 3 million or so. I really doubt most of the players who watched the anime liked it. Personally, I know of several people who disliked it along with others that I've talked to on the internet.  Conjecture and anecdotal evidence are far worse than small sample size data. My point of contention is people better have data to back it up if they're going to claim something is hated by the majority.   Looking at the [Niconico survey results](http://zakitakubu.com/2015/04/04/kancolle-achieves-39-1-not-good-rating-on-niconico-live-survey/) it seems like the majority of fans like the anime except for the final episode.   https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CDiu_6_W8AAt0wM.jpg   [They really don't look that similar](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CDiu_6_W8AAt0wM.jpg).   I think so far the anime is doing a good job of condensing the story but if you're enjoying this then I think you will love the full experience of the manga. Go read it!   The scuffles were more entertaining than the Klitschko and Demetrious Johnson fights.   I went back to the space scene. The camera was moving at 24 fps but there were times the characters would start jittering which made it look like a framerate problem. Also in these first few episodes I've noticed some panning and tilting shots where the camera moved at 12 fps, which I don't think happened in the first season. I think Polygon might have been stretched thin since Ronja was two cours and demanded more manpower for higher quality art and animation.   [Full Sequence](https://streamable.com/xlt7)         I got a feeling the director saw Gravity and decided to copy the single shot free-moving camera work for the dialogue scene in space. Thought it looked good and might be the first time I've seen a long take with dynamic camera movement in anime.   Jesus, that throw to first by Betances was scary.   I'm really curious how the adaptation will handle the heavy psychological, philosophical and political exposition and discourse that were present in Genocidal Organ.  Still haven't read Harmony.      Sometimes Jarrett Jack hero ball works but a lot of the time it makes me want to throw the remote at the tv.   A frugal and squatter MC and a panhandling cat as a sidekick. Perfect combo.   [He just offers the best advise when it comes to matters of the heart](http://i.imgur.com/VvVUQT4.jpg).   Tama loves her monja. [She even sung about it.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HOAY0XdzzM)      Quite honestly - when Lebron was 21, he wasn't as good at basketball as Davis is now.  As a 21 year old Lebron average 31.4/6.6/7. Lead the league with a VORP of 9.5 compared to Davis's 5.7 this year.   Alright, time to start watching Sazae-san.   More than halfway through **Bamboo Blade**. Simple characters and story but it's very charming and funny. It's a bit like Hanayamata but with Kendo, and with less drama and more laughs.  Also, I think the English dub is great.   YES   Oh wow I forgot that Ian Eagle and the Czar are also doing this game. I like this duo better.   Give the ball to Brook you fucking idiots.      You take this MC, throw it in a pot, add some genius ability, characters to make fool of, and a damsel in distress. Baby, youve got a Stu going.    I guess this is what it would look like if Tatsuya Shiba became a chef.      Kyubei's SFX penis crying along with her was the funniest part.  I was expecting a gag with Kondo being NTR'd by Ham-san.        Every season I sometimes pickup an anime with a wacky concept (e.g. Kancolle, Mahouka Koukou no Rettousei) just for the novelty of it and with very little expectations. This was my pick for this season and it was definitely better than expected. But now I have some expectations for it and the prospect of adapting a bunch of chapters into 12 episodes doesn't sound too encouraging. I think as long as the show remains funny I'll be satisfied, then give the manga a read sometime later.      When they showed that tiny cyborg ninja standing on the puddle of that girl's blood I had to rewind to make sure that really happened. I need to know more about that finger slicer.  Kind of disappointed that the phonetic lip syncing and expressive facial animation that Polygon did in Sanzoku no Musume Ronja didn't carry over to season 2 of Sidonia. This pretty much suggests the budget difference between the two. Action scenes still looked great with great sense of speed.   The "sloth on head" got a good chuckle out of me. The light hearted humor continues to be funny. The usage of narrator had some good comedic timing.  Also, gotta give NHK some love for always backing two cour shows.

The problem is the 60 fps is just frame interpolation not actual animation. CG actually hand animated at 60 fps would look great but the man-power and budget required would be ridiculous even for Disney/Pixar and Dreamworks. CG at 60 fps with the use of Mo-cap is probably doable though.   These are animated at 12 fps. They look pretty fluid.  http://gfycat.com/PowerlessGaseousBernesemountaindog  http://gfycat.com/UnsightlyEuphoricAiredale  http://gfycat.com/ThoroughGleefulKentrosaurus  http://gfycat.com/HastyMetallicGar  http://i.imgur.com/SC1FxWK.gifv   [Source](https://vimeo.com/103109019)      Nadai is a hell of a drug.  Yona in that dancing outfit. I wonder what's the connection between Hak and Lili. My best guess is they were arranged to be married when they were kids.  It seems like these arcs are building up to a bigger conflict with the Kai Empire.   Nataru Fights (Birdy the Mighty: Decode 02). So emotionally driven to the point they were cathartic.        This is something Tony Stark would do.   That fight sequence was kind of sloppy. The character and camera movements kept switching between right-to-left and left-to-right with very little continuity connecting those switches. The lack of sense of direction made it feel so disjointed.   He seemed very aware of the potential of a sucker punch. Someone can be trained but if they lack that awareness they could still get caught with a punch.   This show struggled to make sense of each conflict for every arc and the girls role in mitigating it. Character motives, why people are fighting, what they're fighting about and other story elements just get jumbled together. The show's redeeming qualities are the girls were really endearing and at times the animation and art were vividly colorful and energetic.   But Erika is more into BL.    Logic was already ignored when people think a show without a high budget can look like a high budget quality show by simply switching studios.  Other than the character design changes I didn't think the animation and art this season was any worse than the last.    I know you guys love Madhouse but it's kind of odd there's not a single praise for Yuzuru Tachikawa, the creator, writer, and director of the show.      [Death Parade Episode 12 - Cinematography](http://animecinematography.blogspot.com/2015/03/death-parade-episode-12.html)    Hmm...plans for the 2nd season was announced on November 2014, that's news to me. First season sold really bad (374 discs first week sales). The backers must have known this would be the case from the start, so the anime series was mainly for the promotion of the Garo franchise.  I'm in for the 2nd season. The 1st season had an uneven quality but nothing egregiously dislikeable. It also had some great moments and overall the show was entertaining.   [Source](https://youtu.be/GZ39V34qInQ)      [](/s "Can I lie?"). Such a great moment and memorable line.   That would've been a great quietly dramatic scene if it was a minute shorter and had an actual payoff.   [From this short movie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWMnzbj61mc feature=youtu.be)  [Brief write-up on it](http://animecinematography.blogspot.com/2015/03/645-am-sun-31-august-2014.html)         The "Dark Dragon" name gets a funnier use later on.  Also the chapters after this finale are seriously funny.      That fight was a riot. It had a fireman's carry throw, rear naked choke, "look over there" trick, ear pulling and a Rocky-ish music. The other robbers' reaction were amusing too.   Technically it's not even a revival as this episode made clear she can't bring the dead back to life.    I must admit I pity her for choosing him.  I think she's just using him.   Thank god, Galfa's character didn't get the redemption route. I was worried that might happen after Joseph's "I admired you" speech. That character was irredeemable. I think he was basically an allegorical character that represented the negative qualities of humans, such as jealousy, greed, dishonesty and etc.      You should've formed your own club where you look for time travelers, espers and aliens.   Have you watched Shirobako? How accurate is its depiction of the anime industry?   At this point I'm all for Asseylumnator plot twist.   Then come back alive for another season.      I really didn't see anything wrong with the CGI in this PV. I swear, the CG could have top notch quality cel shading with Pixar level animation and people would still complain.         [Death Parade Episode 11 - Cinematography](http://animecinematography.blogspot.com/2015/03/death-parade-episode-11.html)      I wonder if this might get a live action J-drama adaptation. I'd definitely give it a watch if that happens.   This was my second read through so it didn't affect me as much but I remember being close to tearing up at the "I love you" part. The nice slow build up to that part was what made it so emotive.  The rooftop scene was practically Kaori's love confession so this letter was more of a reinforcement of her feelings and less of a confession beyond the grave. Although some may feel it's still the latter and be peeved by it.  I thought it was a great manga. Kousei's character development had an ebb and flow to it instead of a linear progression. It made his development feel natural since people don't improve and change at a constant pace. The story was also very effective at demonstrating the notion of bonding, healing and expressing oneself through music. I think this was less of a love story and more of a human drama between two people supporting each other through music as they navigate lifes tribulations.   A lot of NYC subway platforms don't have enough space for proper line forming, especially the island platform ones.  For example: [The Wall Street Subway Platform](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/27/Wall_Street_Subway.jpg)   I missed how fun these Karasuno guys can be. Is there enough material yet for a second season?   The episode gets you all hyped up for the duel and then cliff hanger. Next episode should be fun.   They would also adjust by hand if they don't like the preset mouth shapes for certain scenes.  http://streamable.com/timn  Here's the full interview and behind the scenes: https://youtu.be/Vshf3qiYQ8U      I think if you look at their relationship from a purely romantic standpoint then youre not going to get much out of it. If you look at their relationship as human drama between two people supporting each other through music as they navigate lifes tribulations, then I think its a relationship thats layered and gratifying.   Whenever I see the ED with Lara in it my heart sinks a bit.      [Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso Episode 21 - Cinematography ](http://animecinematography.blogspot.com/2015/03/shigatsu-wa-kimi-no-uso-your-lie-in.html)   It's probably already flooded with tears.  I thought I was ready for that rooftop scene after finishing the manga. Nope, it still got a few tears out of me.   I would have preferred if we heard Mattis's side of the story that lead to the reunion. It was still touching though.    I hope Marion comes back healthy. I'm curious to see what a perimeter defense of LeBron, Shumpert and Marion would look like.    edit: I think CG in anime actually suffer more from the simple motions rather than the complex. They can be wonderfully fluid when complex, but look robotic when it's just a simple tilt of the head.  http://gfycat.com/GeneralPlumpIggypops  I think that's pretty damn good.     Episodes 47-50 of Cross Game were the most gratifying moments in anime I've ever experienced. Episode 47 is really damn memorable especially the line Kou delivered.   You're right about the inconsistent quality of character animation but there are plenty of traditional anime that are worse but we give it a pass because we have gotten used to it.  Actually one of the best character and facial animation I've seen in anime is from Sanzoku no Musume Ronja, another CG show done by Polygon.  http://gfycat.com/PowerlessGaseousBernesemountaindog  http://gfycat.com/UnsightlyEuphoricAiredale    This reminded me how well shot this anime was. Yeah, the video cherry picked the best shots but the entirety of the first season had good quality cinematography.  Shizuno did a great job directing the first season. I'm a bit nervous about the second season being directed by a first time director (Hiroyuki Seshita).   After this season ends, it's manga marathon time for me.  I had enough self control to stop reading around the time they met Ki-ja but after seeing what's about to develop I just can't wait for the 2nd season that might not come.   Thank god we have two more episodes. It would've been painful if the season ended that way. This episode packed so much hype; Jaeha flying to the rescue, we get to see more of Shinah skills, Yona's killer instinct and "the reunion."  Really liked how Yona's development through a climactic external conflict was followed by her having to face her internal conflict, which is her feelings for Soo-Won. Pretty damn excited about the reactions from Yona, Soo-Won and Hak in the final two episodes.  Also, Hak is barely making any progress with Yona as it is and now Soo-Won shows up.    Read this chapter and then chapter 44...ahh that feeling of enveloping sadness. I was welling but the dam didn't quite break. I think anime will do that if executed really well.  I really appreciate that it didn't go big for the tear jerker, like having Kousei by Kaori's deathbed or something equally superfluously morose. The manga stayed true to her story which is not about that she's terminally ill but the way she lived and her connection with Kousei.   The hand washing scene was excellently storyboarded. The graphic match cuts of Kousei and Kaori's hands working in rhythm with the alternating silence and sound of running water was serenely melancholic.  Also really liked the reserved use of canted framing. It was saved for the right moments. A lot of anime tend to overuse canted shots when things get tense or dramatic and the effect gets lost. The hand washing scene saved it for the last shot and it worked well as a visual supplement to Kousei's emotions.    Not sure if I'm describing this right but the dialogue between Ronja and Lovis, and her summer speech felt prose-like.  21 episodes in and I'm still loving the mouth animation. Really gonna miss that once this is over.  Also don't watch the preview.          I thought the Yuuge episode was pretty light hearted except for the [](/s "unhappy marriage part"). I also liked all of them since they touched on different aspects of life but the last one was really depressing.   The show cracked Japan's top ten animation TV ratings a few times, so it's doing well. S2 is highly likely.   Reinhard von Lohengramm  "Heil Kaiser Reinhard"  	150
 http://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/2shhfy/til_no_one_born_blind_has_ever_developed/   Way to go meta, I like it.    At least he hid your own hourglass from you. Otherwise....shudder.    Black, Eyes, Wide, Smile   See, we got this.    It's weird, I just watched him this weekend in Viva Rock Vegas.    Peter Beeter.   What?! No, I wasn't hiding it! I just never made an OOC post plugging it. Seriously, everything in that book is available in Nosleep for free. Full disclosure, just sayin!   Alright, my first plug on the OOC: http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00OACJJEC  Had to happen eventually!   This is why I left Minnesota.   yeah...I am a wordy person, it's true.   Excellent.   Damn, it's long    I liked Tusk but I like weird shit    These kinds of troubling illusions lasts for days. I would wake in the middle of the night from sweaty dreams of screaming trees and when I went outside for fresh air - I would see them.  Members of the crew, friends of mine, some like brothers, standing at the tree line. In the moonlight I saw their silhouettes as they stared out into the wood in an unmoving, unbroken line. Why this anomaly didn't affect me, I did not know.  During the days, the others were quiet and irritable. Our foreman, O'Connor, simply walked the length of the tree line watching our work intently.  He said nothing to anyone until the final afternoon, when I noticed him standing next to the Harvester I was using and yelling excitedly at me. I turned off the vehicle.  "-can't do that here, it's not ours. The trees can't cut themselves down, that's our job!"  "What're you sayin', boss?" I asked as he took a breath.  "You can't cut those trees down, they live in them trees."  "What? Who does?"  "The people right in front of your eyes, boy, the ones staring daggers at you!"  He spun me around and pointed out into the wooden canopy.  "They're lookin right at you. You can't cut down their trees, that's where they hang."  "I don't- I don't see anything, boss."  "They can't cut themselves down and we can't cut them down. It's our job to get them bodies down but they live in those trees so we can't. Don't you see, boy?"  I stared at him and slowly shook my head. What was happening?  "This was their forest long before we got here. The trees they eat the people and then the people become part of the tree. The people, they're the eyes of the trees. See?"  My foreman pointed at something high in the treetops to the far left of where we were standing.  And that's when I finally saw it.  A body, just one, swaying sickeningly in the wind, hung by the neck from a branch. He wore the clothes of a lumberjack.  "What.." I breathed. "Who is that? We have to help him!"  "No!" O'Connor caught me by the back of the shirt as I started toward the dead man. "The trees have him. He's part of them now. He's their eyes and their ears. He's not one of us anymore. Can't you hear him singing? He's happy there."  I backed away from my foreman quickly and slammed into the side of the Harvester.  "I don't understand," was all I could choke out.  "I sent Anderson in there to talk to the people hanging from the branches."  "Anderson's gone?"  "Into the wood."  "No. We have to get him back. I don't know what's happening but we have to leave here, now!"  "Who would you send? Douglas and Crossley followed him in, they want to talk to the hanging people."  "What about Royce?!"  "Royce is over there." He jabbed a thumb over his shoulder at young Dan Royce, who loading a flatbed with small pieces of lumber.  "We need to find the others."  "No, boy, we need to return the wood to the forest. That's what they want."  "Who?"  "Haven't you been listening? The people hanging from the trees! They want the Ash returned. That's their wood. Their brothers."  "You're insane."  "No, boy. I just listen." O'Connor held his finger up to his ear and then turned on one foot and walked deliberately back towards camp. As soon as he was far enough away, I ran at top speed over to Royce, who was climbing into the cab of the flat bed.  "Royce, we gotta go."  "What? Where?"  "Boss has lost his mind. He sent Anderson, Crossley and Douglas out into the woods and Dan...I think there's a body in a tree over there to the west."  "Well yeah, of course there is. There's bodies in all the trees, man." Royce shook his head at me like I'd just told him college is expensive.  "Wha... No, Dan. No...don't say that, please."  "Hey, just relax, brother. I'm gonna go dump this lumber back into the forest and then you and me can head back to camp, get some dinner. Sound good? I think you need a drink."  Royce slapped his hat against the steering wheel and started the engine. I watched helplessly as he drove the truck to the treeline and made a three point turn to back up to the wood. I couldn't watch anymore.  I ran back to camp as the first streaks of pink and orange bled into the quickly darkening sky. As soon as I arrived I dove into my tent and quickly packed my things. I would steal whatever truck I needed to to get out of here, Royce and O'Connor were welcome to do whatever they pleased.  Zipping it shut, I threw my pack out of the tent and stepped out into the quiet moonlight of early evening. Royce and the foreman were no where to be found and the night was silent except for the wind whistling through the trees.  But no...was that whistling? I cocked my head to the side and listened as intently as I'd seen the others do so many days before. No, it wasn't the whistling of cold air through the tree tops. It was singing.  Beautiful, haunting, wordless singing. I didn't turn around, I couldn't. I kept my back to forest and my eyes to the ground. I mustn't look. I mustn't. I knew I would be lost to the wood if I did.  Something suddenly shot out of the darkness on my left and I turned my head to watch someone running across the field. It was O'Connor. Just before he reached the tree line, he threw his arms open as if to embrace the wood and disappeared into its shadows.  It was the last I saw of anyone. Knowing that only I remained, I ran to the nearest flatbed at camp, climbed into the cabin and started the hesitant engine.  I gripped the steering wheel and took three deep breaths as unnatural shadows danced at the tree line.  Flipping on the headlights, I yanked the wheel to the right and stepped on the gas, tearing out of camp and onto the road we'd come down to get here.  I pressed the gas pedal all the way to the floor and maneuvered the bulky truck over the unforgiving dirt road.  It was half a mile before I noticed it. No, not the singing..the trees.  They were leaning into the road, over it, the branches above me blocking out the stars and moonlight. They were crushing down on me. I waited as long as I could, I really did. I didn't want to turn on the high-beams, I didn't want to know.  But after a near run in with a large boulder, I knew I had no choice. I took a deep breath, and switched on the brights.  The people hanging in the trees stared down at me, their mouths open in unnaturally long ovals. Their eyes were white and reflected the light of the headlights menacingly back at me. Their manner of dress was impossible to discern, so decomposed were their bodies. The trees seemed to lean in further then, and the bodies dropped lower over the road.  I heard the scrape of feet along the top of the cab. I switched off the high-beams.  As soon as the darkness poured into the road, they started singing. They were same high notes I'd heard back at camp, though the pitch heightened with every quarter mile I traveled. I couldn't see the bodies anymore, though occasionally the low headlights would catch reflective, white eyes.  It took most of the night, but eventually the hanging people became sparser, the Ash trees less imposing. I hadn't seen a hanging body or white eyes in over 3 miles when I finally hit a paved road.  I don't know what they were. I don't know what they wanted. I only know that the others went into the trees. And they never came out again.    Stalac**T**ites because they're on the **T**op.    That's so metal.    I think you did just fine!   I read that in Bender's voice.    I like our team's story. It's playing to each of our strengths. That was a solid beginning, Ash!   hey that was a totally true story.   The next few days passed uneventfully. Bob and I interacted very little, though he seemed to be withdrawn from everyone. Nights at the logging camp were spent complaining about the cold and unnatural resilience of the timber; it was a fact that we had never replaced so many blades on a job before. It was unsettling for everyone, especially the older guys who had been doing this for most of their lives. Ash trees weren't known to be difficult.  Over the course of several days, the evenings became quieter and more somber. More and more of the crew spent their nights staring silently out into the wood. I felt the draw, too, the draw to look into the dark abyss but I avoided the call of the wood. I didn't want to see into the trees. I didn't want to feel the way the others looked; eyes wide and focused, breath shallow and face contorted tightly as if they were straining to see or hear something beyond the tree line.  Two weeks into the job we were told that more blades were on order as we had burned through all the equipment that we had. The blades would take three days to arrive as the area was densely packed with trees and quite remote - which was the reason we were harvesting this area by hand in the first place.    But something happened on the third and final day of our downtime. Bob, who hadn't spoken a word to anyone in almost a week, walked out to the tree line just after dawn and spent  the morning staring into the forest, never moving, never even shifting his feet.  No one approached Bob until midday when I volunteered to bring him a dry, poorly made ham sandwich.   "Hey Bob," I called out cheerfully when I was within his earshot. "The lads made you a sandwich."  Bob didn't seem to register that I was there. He was staring up into the branches,  at the tops of the Ash trees.   I held the sandwich out and when he didn't turn to take it, I gently reached out and touched his shoulder.   Bob didn't move, though his eyes flicked briefly to me and then back to the trees.  "They're staring."  "Ah...who's staring?"  "Them. Them in the trees."  I laid a flat hand on my brow to block the light of the cold sun and followed Bob's gaze. I saw nothing but white bark and dead leaves rustling in the wind.  "Squirrels?"  Bob continued staring into the canopy, his eyes sliding from one tree to the next.   "No. The hanging people. The ones hanging in the Ash."  My eyes darted frantically around the wood. What in the hell was Bob looking at?   "Don't you see them? They're staring at you."  My body shuddered involuntarily at his words though I still saw nothing in the trees.  "....and me."  "Bob-"  "They're dead, alright, hangin' there, swingin' in the wind. The skin is peeling off the face and rotting from the body, but they're still lookin' at us. Eyes as white as the bark of the branches they're hangin' from."  "Ah, B- Bob," I took a steadying swallow of the thin air. "Bob, why don't you come back to camp? If that's what you're seeing...you shouldn't be looking at that."  "It ain't their stares that scare me, lad. It's the singin'."  "They're singing to you?"  "No, a'course not! They only sing when ya ain't lookin' at 'em. Soon as I turn my back, they'll start again."  I turned away from the wood and quickly muttered that I was returning to camp. I hurried away, leaving Bob with his delusions.   As soon as I got back, I tracked down our foreman and told him that Bob was slipping, and likely needed to see the medic, though I didn't tell him exactly why I thought so. Bob had a daughter, a single mother on hard times, and he desperately needed the pay from this job. But he never did receive it.   Bob returned from his vigil in the company of the foreman some hours later but he left again that very night after everyone had gone to bed.  After that, no one saw Bob again.

Stella should be pulling up with the kids any minute and she'd flip her shit if she saw me smoking.   As I watched for headlights coming around the corner of the hotel parking lot I popped a breath mint and took a swig of water. Phoenix was hot in July - oppressively hot. And even though the sun was almost down I couldn't last out here much longer.  While it was a nice escape from my frigid hometown of Flagstaff in the winter, Phoenix left much to be desired in the summertime. I tried to come down as infrequently as possible during the during the summer months but sometimes work made that impossible. I always hated leaving the mountains. Even though the valley was only two and a half hours away from Flag, it may as well have been a thousand miles. My small, mountain town and the sprawling, desert city might as well be different countries all together.   I saw the headlights of Stella's silver Mazda peek around the corner of the building and I pushed myself off the truck.   She pulled into a nearby space and I smiled as I went to greet her. I could tell by the look on her face when she got out that she was worn down.   "How was the drive?" I asked her as I opened the back door to let Aiden and Wyatt out.  "Long. You know I hate that drive, I don't know how you do it so often."  I laughed. "Well that's what I get paid for. A necessary evil to keep my family living in luxury."  "Dad, do I have to go tonight?" Aiden yelled from the trunk of the car where he was trying, in vain, to pull his overnight bag out of the jostled mess of luggage.  "What you don't like dressing up?"  He made a face at me. "I hate it. Plus there's not gonna be other kids there."  "That's not true; Dani and Paul's kids will be there."  "They're girls, they don't count."  "You'll have your brother."  "Daaaaad, he's only three."  "Aiden!" Stella yelled as she propped the door into the hotel open. "Quit complaining and get your brother inside. What's the room number, Matt?"  "323. Door's open."  Aiden took his brother's hand and walked him inside and down the hall. When Stella and I were alone, I eyed the trunk with confusion.   "Why so many bags? You know we're only here for tonight, right?"  "Yes, Matt, I know that." Stella rubbed her temples.  "You feeling okay?"  "Yeah, I'm fine. Just tired."  "This heat probably isn't helping either. Do you want to go inside? I'll get the bags."  "No, Ill help. Have you seen Dani and Paul yet this week?"  "Not yet. They've been busy."  Dani and Paul were very close friends of my wife and I.  The only reason Stella and kids were even in Phoenix was to attend their tenth anniversary dinner this evening.  Id been here all week working on campus.  As much as I loved our friends I couldnt wait to depart in the morning for higher elevations and cooler temperatures  even with Dani and Paul's three daughters in tow. Stella had graciously offered to watch their kids while they spent the next week in Mexico.   "Do you have an Excedrin, hon?"   "Inside. Is your head hurting again?" I asked.  "Just a bit."  "You've been tired  and nauseous a lot in the past few days, Stel. Are you sure you're okay?"  "Yeah. I've just been getting a lot of headaches lately."  ___________  SATURDAY  **07-23-2011    Eyewitness account of  K.B.      10:23 a.m.**  *I don't know why I noticed it, maybe just because it was sitting there for so long. It was a blue suburban - 2009 or 2010 model maybe?   and it was parked on the side of the highway outside of New River just idling.  I had to take multiple trips in and out of New River that morning for work and that truck probably sat there for 25 minutes. It barely fit on the shoulder even though it was parked right up next to the guard rail. It was definitely a road hazard. I was planning to check on the car the next time I went out but by the time I got back it was gone.*                               **07-23-2011    Eyewitness account of  L.L.      11:01 a.m.**  *I was in the far right lane getting off of Northbound 17 at Exit 144 in Black Canyon City. This blue suburban suddenly merges over two lanes and cuts me off. It was so sudden that I was surprised it didn't roll. I got pretty angry and laid on my horn. I was going to pull up next to the truck at the stop sign but I saw little kids in the car so I just kept driving. The woman in the drivers seat didn't even look at me. She looked so dazed - I'm not even sure she heard my horn.*  _____________________   FRIDAY  "You look amazing, Stel."   My wife, after 8 years of marriage, was still one of the most beautiful women I'd ever seen. Not that she believed it, of course; in fact I was pretty sure she never had.   Stella was a few years older me and I knew that had always bothered her. When I first met my wife she was a quiet, nervous girl who still lived at home with her parents. We met at an engagement party for a mutual friend and I used the next few months to slowly nudge her out of her shell. It didn't take me long to realize that Stella was already in love with me by the time I'd formally met her.  I married my wife a year later and got her pregnant immediately. Stella was over the moon, all shed ever wanted was to be a mother. She told me the day of Aidens birth was the happiest day of her life.  *Maybe that's what she needs*, I mused as I watched my wife lather her arms with hotel supplied vanilla scented lotion. *Maybe another baby would make her happy again.*  Stella had fallen into a sort of depression in the last year and refused to go to the doctor. I did the best I could to make the good times great and the bad times more tolerable for her.  Did you hear me, babe? You look stunning.  "I'm glad you still think that," she said without looking at me.  "You know I've always thought that."  Stella finally looked away from the mirror and gave me an impish smirk. "Would be nice if you showed me....physically, more often." She winked.  I sighed and walked over to wrap my arms around her lotion-slick shoulders. God knows, we hadn't been intimate in months. And I knew that a sensitive girl like Stella must be going crazy, thinking I was falling out of love with her or some other nonsense.   "Well, if we didn't have five kids in the house over the weekend..." I trailed off and gave her my most seductive smile in the mirror.  She frowned. "You just always seem to have an excuse, Matt. If you're not working late on campus, you're down in Phoenix. I just don't understand why you get pulled down to that campus so much when you teach at the Flagstaff campus."  I dropped my arms from her shoulders and ran a hand through my messy hair. "Stel, I've told you, I'm helping out the chemistry department down there. I have to continue to do that if I want tenure."  Stella walked away from me with a dismissive wave.   "Boys!" She yelled, knocking on the door to our adjoining room with the kids. "Aiden! Is Wyatt dressed? Bring him in here; we're leaving for dinner in a few."  ____________   SATURDAY  **07-23-2011   Eyewitness account of Officer J. Pendlo (Badge #2881)     11:27 a.m.**  *I had a driver pulled over in Black Canyon City on Squaw Valley Road in the shoulder of the Westbound lane. As I was running his driver's license I noticed a dark blue 2009 Chevy Suburban stopped on the dirt road off Maggie Mine Road leading to the abandoned dog track. Plate number 22D4N12. The back bumper was heavily dented and the passenger side of the vehicle was sideswiped.*  *A woman had the back door open and was leaning against the vehicle's frame talking to someone in the backseat. I heard yelling coming from inside the vehicle. The woman stumbled back a bit and then climbed into the backseat of the suburban. She appeared to be distressed. I intended to go investigate the vehicle when I finished writing the traffic violation. The vehicle was gone by the time I pulled out some minutes later. I searched the area but I believe the vehicle was back on the highway by then.*                           **07-23-2011    Eyewitn+ess account of E.S.    11:27 a.m.**  *I was pulled over for running a stop sign and I was texting my wife while the officer was back running my plates. I looked up and saw a woman and a maybe 9 year old girl standing outside the car. The woman was trying to walk forward and the girl was pushing her back trying to get her to sit down. At one point the girl got back into the car and the woman slid down the car to the ground. She looked really out of it. Then all of the sudden she got a sort of second wind and sprung up and walked around the other side of the car, jerked the door open and started yelling at the girl inside. I could hear a couple kids in there crying. She had her hand in the car trying to reach someone. Then she crawled into the backseat and about a minute later the car left.*  ___________   FRIDAY   I shook Paul's hand as I grabbed a scotch off the bar. "Congrats, old man! Ten years is quite an accomplishment in this day and age."  "Well, you're right behind me, there Matt." He laughed.  "Very true," I said, glancing over at our wives who were talking in the corner. But loving a woman that long is so easy when she's so beautiful." I saw her laugh then and admired the boistrous rise and fall of her chest, the swell of her breasts emerging slightly from the low cut glittering neckline of her gown. Even though she was so torn right now I hoped she knew how much I loved her.  "Thick as thieves, those two," Paul chuckling, watching the scene beside me. "Ever since college."  "Worse than sisters." I nodded as Dani picked up her youngest, Ava, and handed the squealing 1 year old to my wife. Stella laughed louder than I had heard in the past year and bounced little Ava on her hip. I smiled as I watched her. Another baby may be the solution after all.   "Uncle Matt?" My attention turned to the lovely young lady standing behind me, Pauls oldest. Izzy was intelligent like her mother but the spitting image of her father. The two had always been close. Paul put his arm around his daughterand kissed her on the head.  "Hi Izzy, I smiled, are you excited to spend the weekend in Flagstaff? I think Aunt Stella is going to take you hiking tomorrow."  "Yeah, I'm excited. Um, Wyatt keeps trying to pull people's wine glasses off the table and he's already spilled sprite on himself."  "Ugh, that boy. Thanks for the heads up, Iz, I'll go get that little outlaw."  I found my son sitting in between Paul and Dani's other daughter, Emma, and his big brother.  "We were just holding him here. He's trying to drink the wine." Emma said confidently as Aiden nodded.  "Is that so?"  "Well, he was trying to grab it. I think he was going to drink it."  Yeah, he was. He was, Dad, but I stopped him.  I shook my head lightheartedly and looked around for Stella. She was now sitting at a table chatting and laughing with Pauls sister, not a care in the world. I watched her for a moment and frowned. My wife wasn't one to neglect the whereabouts of her children, especially our youngest. Most of her days were spent following Wyatt around the world making sure he was safe and happy. It was very unlike her.  I picked Wyatt up from the bench. "Okay boys, it's time to start calming down. We have an early morning so I think we'll head out in about 20 minutes."  "I want to stay and play with Emma." Aiden stood up and crossed his arms.  "I thought you didn't like girls," I teased.  "Dad, STOP!" Aiden yelled so loud that people on the other side of the room turned to look. He ran out into the hall, his face reddening with every step. Emma and I both laughed and I looked over again at Stella hoping she was laughing too. But she wasn't.  Stella was sitting down at the suddenly empty table with her head in her hands, rubbing her temples.  ______________  SATURDAY  **07-23-2011    Transcirpt of call from witness C.K.    12:08 p.m.**  DPS Operator: *Highway Patrol, where can I direct your call?*  Caller C.K.: *Hi, yeah, sorry, I didn't know who to call but I thought 911 probably wasnt it. Ah, there's a truck in-*  DPS Operator: *Do you have a road safety issue, ma'am?*  Caller C.K.: *Yeah, I'm about 5 miles north of Cordes Lakes on the I-17 and there's a truck in the left lane going slow. Like, really slow.*   DPS Operator: *I'm sorry ma'am, but we don't handle those types of calls. Would you like me to put you through to emergency services?*  Caller C.K.: *No, I don't think it's an emergency. But I passed her and she's going about 25 miles per hour in a 65 mile per hour zone. She just has this, like, blank look on her face. She needs to get off the road, because she keeps crossing the middle line. She looks really out of it.*  DPS Operator: *Would you like me to put you through to emergency services?*  Caller C.K.: *No, it's fine. I'm way past her now, I just thought someone should know about it but yeah, I guess, I dont- I don't need to report it at this point.*                            **07-23-2011    Transcript of voicemail from the cell phone of Paul Grigg (602-307-29xx)            12:14 p.m.**  *Daddy, I'm scared, can you come get me- me?

"10:30 but the earlier you get to our house the better. Dani and I wouldn't mind some alone time." Paul leaned back on his heels and winked at his wife.   "Alright, alright, Matt and I know how it goes," Stella giggled and leaned her head against my shoulder. "How does 7:30 sound?"   "Earlier." Paul growled wrapping his arms around Dani's waist and nuzzling her ear.  I'd known my wife so well and for so long that I detected the instant she felt uncomfortable and intimidated. She laughed nervously and I could feel the envy radiating off of her. Stella had always wanted the sort of open affection, no apologies relationship that Dani and Paul shared. It had just never been that way with us. I opened my mouth to break the tension but Stella spoke first.  "You guys are like kids. Having sex all the time and in Mexico no less. Maybe you'll babysit for us some weekend and we can go to Mexico."  "Stel, are you drunk?" Paul teased. "You're terrified of Mexico!"  "You know I don't drink! And I'd risk being kidnapped in MexicoMatt would protect me." Stella smiled up at me with the sort of eyes I hadn't seen in so long I'd forgotten how beautiful they were.  I wrapped my arm around her and pulled her to me.   "Girls! In the car!" Paul yelled to his daughters who were running around the empty parking lot. "I swear they're usually not this crazy." Paul shook his head.  "Oh don't worry about it; Stella laughed, we've got lots of room to run on our property. They're  in safe hands."  ________________   SATURDAY  **07-23-2011    Eyewitness account of J.S.       12:37 p.m.**  *I was buying cigarettes at the Chevron in Cordes Lakes when I heard somebody slam on their breaks  outside and punch the horn. I looked out the window and saw a blue SUV drive by, just as calm as can be while this guy in a white pickup is yelling out his window at it.*  *Then I was driving over to Wagners and I saw the same blue SUV going down Stagecoach Trail. The driver pulled over to park the car on the shoulder and then suddenly changed her mind or something and flipped a u-turn instead. The tires left tracks in the road. I could see some little kids heads bobbing around through the back windshield. I decided to follow her because I thought maybe she was drunk. We see a lot of drunk drivers around here.*  *So I get in my car and follow her back down Stagecoach. She starts speeding up as she gets closer to the highway. I estimate she got up to about 75 and the limit on Stagecoach is 40. I lost her when she ran the light at Oasis. I would have called 911 to report her but I didn't have my phone.*                                  **07-23-2011    Transcript of call from witness M.M.           12:52 p.m.**  Dispatcher: *911, what's your emergency?*  Caller M.M.: *Hi, I'm calling to report a truck going the wrong way down the 69.*   Dispatcher: *You said the vehicle is going the wrong way?*  Caller M.M.: *Yeah, he's going north, orsouth, sorry, in the Northbound lane.

"Yeah," she moaned, "Just another migraine."  "Stel, we gotta get you to the doctor. These chronic headaches worry me." "No, I'm fine, really, I'm fine. I already saw my doctor about it and he said it's likely the start of menopause."  I tried not to show the surprise on my face. I must have failed.  "Yes, Matthew, I'm going through menopause because Im older than you." She snapped. "You knew that when you married me."  "It's not that, I just-"  "Save it." Stella rolled away from me and buried her face in the pillows. "Just go."  "Go?"  "Yeah, just start heading home. I'll be right behind you. I just need to sleep for another half an hour."  "I cant. We told Paul and Dani we would pick the girls up early."  "Fuck them. And fuck you for caring so much about their sex life."  I got up from the bed and awkwardly straightened my tie in the mirror just to give myself something to do. It seemed I had been right about Stella's feelings of inadequacy last night.   I'd made a move on her as soon as wed gotten the kids to bed the night before.  Id pulled her into me and slid my hands down her hips, then slowly pulled her shirt up over her head. Id let my hand slip down into her lacy bra. Id kissed her neck...  Shed jerked away from me then, complaining that she suddenly felt nauseous. I believed her too. Her face had grown pale and her hands were shaking slightly as she unzipped her pants and threw them in the corner.   Then she'd gone straight to sleep.  "I really don't give a shit about their sex life, Stella, I care about being where we said we'd be when we said we'd be there."  "I'm sorry," she whimpered from the bed after a moment. "It just hurts so much."  "Why don't I take the boys and go get the girls and then I'll come back here. It'll give you some time to sleep."  "No, it's, it's fine. I'll take an Excedrin and I'll go get the girls. You go ahead and head north, somebody needs to let the dogs out this morning."  "Okay, sweetie. Want me to take the boys?"  "No, let them sleep in. Just take my car and leave me the suburban."  "Are you sure?"  "I'm sure. I'll take the kids."  ___________________   SATURDAY  **07-23-2011    Transcript from the interview of Danielle E. Grigg**  *Stella showed up just after 8 o'clock. She seemed* [pause] *normal. She came to the door, she was smiling, and she picked up Ava and tickled her. I mean she was just normal, old Stella. I didnt know, I couldnt tell that anything was wrong,* [pause] *um,* [pause] *excuse I'm, I'm sorry.* [pause] [crying]  *I couldnt tell that anything was wrong with her.  Paul came to the door with all the kids bags and gave her a hug. She hugged him back.*   *He walked all the luggage out to Matt's car and I kissed and hugged my girls goodbye.* [pause] *I'm sorry. Um, I kissed my girls goodbye and I held Ava for a minute. And then Paul kissed the kids goodbye. He talked to Izzy for awhile because she was crying and didn't want to leave. Those two , they were like best friends.*  *Then we put the kids in the car and Paul and I said hi to the boys. Izzy, Ava and Wyatt were in the middle row and Emma and Aiden were in the back. Then she  Stella, sorry - hugged us both and told us to have a safe flight. She seemed happy, she told the kids they were going to have a Disney sing-along.* [crying] *Then she backed out of the driveway with my children and I never saw them again.*                                  **7-23-2011       Transcript of call from witness I.N.       1:16 p.m.**  Dispatcher: *Yavapai County 911.*  Caller I.N.: *Um, oh god. Fuck. Oh Christ, there's, this, ah, theres a car that was in front of me and it just went over the guard rail into the canyon. Just, oh god, he just* [inaudible] *and went over. He didn't even slow down at all. I'm still going, should I turn around?*  Dispatcher: *Where are you, sir?*  Caller I.N.: *On the 17.

I'd noticed that truck earlier because it'd been weaving in and out of traffic as it approached me. Something was definitely happening with the driver. She was really calm and steady, like real oddly serene, almost oblivious to what was going on outside of the car. She cut in front of me but I was prepared for it so I slowed down without a problem. She didn't. She just kept going in that trajectory right over the side of the mountain.*  *Other people started puling over too and we tried to get down the cliff but its a pretty sheer drop right there. Then about, well, when I guess we were about halfway down, the truck caught on fire. There were bodies all over the place. Little kids, mostly. I've never seen anything like it. I saw photos of the accident on the news but they were taken after the police had been there and cleaned up a bit. When we first got down into the canyon, it was like looking into hell. All the bodies were still burning. Everyone was dead.*  ________________    SATURDAY AND THE END  I made my first call to Stella's cell phone at 11:04. It rang for awhile and then went to voicemail. This didn't worry me as my wife usually turned her cell phone on silent when she was driving through the mountains; that road had always made her nervous.   At 11:30 I called again, and this time someone sent it to voicemail. I still didn't worry too much. I'd talked to Dani before her flight left that morning and she'd told me Stella hadnt come by to pick up the girls until 8:15 and that shed planned to get the kids some breakfast before she got on the road. A 2 hours drive would put her in close to 11 but my wife was a slow and careful driver.  At noon I started to pace around my office trying Stella's cell phone off and on.   By 1 p.m. I was a wreck.  At 1:14 I got a frantic call from Paul about a voicemail he'd received from Izzy. I immediately called the police and reported my wife missing and the phone call from inside the car. A woman called me back after the longest 40 minutes of my life. She told me there had been an accident and that they were sending someone to my house.   Everything that made me human had suddenly been stripped away from me.  I lost everything that day.  Paul and Dani flew back from Cancun that night and got the news right when they landed. Paul had to be sedated at the airport. Dani was just numb.   Someone brought me what was left of our personal effects from the crash: Emmas suitcase and Stellas overnight bag. All the others had been destroyed in the accident.  Stella's body was too badly burned to do any conclusive toxicology on her. No one had any idea what had happened to my wife, why shed been behaving so strangely or how she lost control of the car. The investigation went on until December of 2012 when the case was closed by DPS. No one knew what happened to Stella but the general consensus, all evidence accounting, was that some sort of medical event had occurred on the day of the crash: possibly a stroke or a series of strokes.   I fought hard to clear Stella's name in the press; they painted her as a drunk and a pill popper. The media also compared her case to something that had happened in New York a few years earlier, the Schuler case.  But Stella didn't drink - ever - or take pills recreationally and she loved her children more than the air she breathed. I hired a private investigator and a lawyer to help me get her body exhumed and retested. Afterward I was told the results were similar to the first tests but that this time the ME had ruled her secondary cause of death Vehicle Crash due to an Unknown Medical Event".   The press finally back off.  Paul killed himself just before Christmas the same year of the accident. Dani told me he locked himself in his office everyday and listened to Izzy's voicemail over and over until one day he hung himself from a cross beam in his daughters room.  Dani and I bonded deeply in our grief. We had both lost so much, almost everything. We talked and cried and suffered together for years. And all along Stella's suitcase sat in my closet. I could never bring myself to unpack it - to unpack her - from my life.  But then Dani moved in with me and my soul began to mend. And for the first time since the accident, I could see ahead of the agonizing pain to a more tolerable existence. I was finally ready to let it all go, to let her go. To emerge from under the crippling darkness into a dull, muted light that I knew would grow brighter with time.    And so one day, I opened the suitcase. And found out what really happened to Stella that day.   On top of my wifes neatly folded clothes was a note she had written to me in black marker. It was only six words, six short words that cast me back into hell, never to return. *I know about you and Dani.*   It was written on a liquor store receipt.

Oh and interesting sidebar: I'm still getting PMs about the plague story's  legitimacy as recently as this morning.    In the comments section, hell no. In PM it's totally up to you. The mammoth story got a little out of control and that's why I started answering people who were concerned with "it's just a story".   Would I in normal circumstances? Only if they seemed really upset about it.    For what it's worth, anyone who took the time to PM the plague writers got an honest answer.    I think it's Paul.    Well done!   ...nice...   I agree, it will turn out *very* well.    Poor /u/captainmagictrousers. I see you asked this question everywhere you go.    This is not The Greatest (Post) in the World, no. This is just a tribute.

I'd like to get some of these industrial people to talk about something the grad students are really concerned with:  getting a job.   No, but I've been working on getting big companies to join our discussions, and this sort of thing is completely outside of the traditional culture. Cultural change is hard, especially when you're talking to people in there late 50's/early 60's!   We didn't, in my opinion that isn't controversial, or particularly relevant.  It's a difference of opinion.  If you're looking for an excuse to be upset, then there probably isn't any talking you out of it though.   Based on the actual AMA, what are your thoughts?   Things worked out pretty well, but I am tired now!   Let me see what I can do, I'm at work and my image capture options are limited...   This is exactly true, I emailed Janice Person in August of 2014 completely out of the blue with my "Come Talk to reddit" sales pitch.  I still have the email chain in our gmail account!   Point them to our AMA Submission Guide!  We have a partnership with the ACS, so you can look forward to some quality AMAs from big name chemists (like Harry Gray!)   It was just posted.     If only this was true, remember corporation are run by people in there late 50's/60's, they have never heard of reddit and took a lot of explaining.      I agree, I want reddit to be a cross-cultural meeting place to discuss important issue in a civil manner.  Some people are more interested in putting on a display of anger, but that doesn't get anyone anywhere.   In contrast to what the conspiracy people believe, corporations aren't really interested in reddit.  They are run by a generation that has largely never heard of reddit, convincing them that putting any effort into it was a challenge.  After that, corporation talk about things *forever* (I speak from experience here.)    Recall when people talk about small business being faster and more agile that big corporations?  This is what they are talking about.   it is only kid gloves to people who can't contain their emotions, people who are used to having civil conversations do so without even thinking about.  There is never any need to be discourteous, just because that is routinely ignored on reddit doesn't make it ok.   That is how it is, very few top scientists work in lab these days, the same is true in academia, Nobel prize winners don't do bench work, they write grants and give talks.   We do let the votes work, on the questions that meet our publicly stated ground rules.  We have been doing this since January of 2014, these aren't new rules.   My apologizes if I misinterpreted your comments, you may have noticed other comments around here, they aren't so nice.  The fact is, I have spent months vetting this AMA, and we know who Fred is, I have contacts within the company and outside who give me information off the record, all of them say Fred is the guy to do this.  All of the political stuff just tells me he can think on his feet, everyone knows he represents Monsanto, that's a given, but he is a scientist, not a MBA or a marketing person.  He may not be in lab now but he did his time which makes him one of us.   whilr I can't require an answer to every question, does anyone doubt there will be far too many questions to answer?, I push all of our AMA guests to answer the top voted questions first. That seems to be the only fair way to go.   We have rules, you chose to ignore them, next time you start by messaging the mods and establishing yourself.  Also, taking pot shots at us is crap.   No, only ask questions that are civil and polite.  One can disagree without being disagreeable.  Anyone who can't frame their question without anger doesn't sufficiently understand the question!   Asking a question in anger, or using humour, does not reduce the validity of the question  It does get the question removed here, and now that you know the ground rules if you violate them you can't complain about your question being removed, since you made the choice to have it removed yourself.  Action = Consequence.   We get those too, organizations doing official AMAs like this is much harder.  Lawyers and human resources are involved.  ugh.   None of that means anything, of course he's a registered lobbyist, you have to do that to talk to politicians, there are legal requirements.  As for contributions, so what?  I've cut multiple checks to politicians, if I could afford to do it more I would, last time I checked that's how the American political system works: you support those who represent your point of view.  "If any mods want my credentials on this feel free to e-mail me. "  And you supplied your email address?  Nope.  So we can't email you, can we?  Also, everyone else making claims **follows the subreddit rules** which require you to get the flair before you make the claim.     They do, and several have flair in /r/science.     This is none of those areas since it could not possibly be decades old.  Also, it's our house, and our rules, those who wish to yell can start their own AMA series in their own subreddit.   I respectfully disagree with you on this.  While he is certianly operations leader, his title that of a scientist.  Every corporation has a bevy of Vice-presidents, it's just a level.  All high-level scientists at science-based companies take on a public outreach function, that's how it is.  Of course this is about public relations, any public interaction necessarily is, that's the definition of talking to the public.  Referring to veiled "credentials" also doesn't get you far here, users with credentials have flair stating such, which you have none.    I have had a year and a half to prepare for this, /r/science can handle it.   I think we can be pretty sure that Monsanto's goal isn't to drive Indian farmers to commit suicide.  The whole concept doesn't pass the sniff test, it's just far to hyperbolic.  From one of the links:  For example, a 2012 paper in The Lancet that surveyed Indias suicide mortality rate noted: Studies from south India have shown that the most common contributors to suicide are a combination of social problems, such as interpersonal and family problems and financial difficulties, and pre-existing mental illness.  So yeah, blaming GMO seeds for every suicide by a farmer since the mid-1990's is beyond misleading, it's unethical.   Actually, reddit only gets AMAs from people trying to promote specific things, getting scientists has not been as easy.  Convincing corporations to take this risk has been very challenging, I've been working on this one for **18** months.   Exactly.  Who would ever come talk to a group that just wants to yell at them? This is the basis of our civility requirement, in addition to it being the right thing to do.   It's not to make them happy, it's to follow our rules. If users don't like our rules, they don't have to post questions.      Could explain what that is?   I can deal with, by removing the comment, and if needed banning the user.   This our house, we make the rules, and the rules are "be polite."   The question if phrased correctly is fine, but that's the point, it needs to be phrased in a civil manner, minus the accusations.   That's actually an example of a question that would be removed as uncivil because it is an accusation not a question, if you don't know how to ask the question with basic decorum, them you aren't qualified to be asking the question.   For those of you who aren't aware, tomorrow's Science AMA is with Dr. Fred Perlak of Monsanto, a legit research scientist here to talk about the science and practices of Monsanto.  First, thanks for your contributions to make /r/science one of the largest, if not the largest, science forums on the internet, we are constantly amazed at the quality of comments and submissions.  We know this is an issue that stirs up a lot of emotion in people which is why we wanted to bring it to you, it's important, and we want important issues to be discussed openly and in a civil manner.  Some background:    **I approached Monsanto about doing an AMA**, Monsanto is not involved in manipulation of reddit comments to my knowledge, and I had substantial discussions about the conditions we would require and what we could offer.  We require that our AMA guests be scientists working in the area, and not PR, business or marketing people. We want a discussion with people who do the science.  We offer the guarantee of civil conversation.  Internet comments are notoriously bad; anonymous users often feel empowered to be vicious and hyperbolic.  We do not want to avoid hard questions, but one can disagree without being disagreeable.  Those who cannot ask their questions in a civil manner (like that which would be appropriate in a college course) will find their comments removed, and if warranted, their accounts banned.  /r/science is a serious subreddit, and this is a culturally important discussion to have, if you can't do this, it's best that you not post a comment or question at all.  Normally we restrict questions to just the science, since our scientists don't make business or legal decisions, it's simply not fair to hold them accountable to the acts of others.  However, to his credit, Dr. Perlak has agreed to answer questions about both the science and business practices of Monsanto because of his desire to directly address these issues.  Regardless of how we personally feel about Monsanto, we should applaud his willingness to come forward and engage with the reddit user base.  The AMA will be posted tomorrow morning, with answers beginning at 1 pm ET to allow the user base a chance to post their questions and vote of the questions of other users.    We look forward to a fascinating AMA, please share the link with other in your social circles, but when you do please mention our rules regarding civil behavior.  Thanks again, and see you tomorrow.

 Ok, a little late but has anyone played Golgo 13? I saw the movie when I was younger and I see the game every so often for cheap but don't know if it's a hidden gem for the NES.   Thanks so far on all these titles! I'm heading on over to ebay and Amazon to check some out since i have no local game store where I live :(   I saw this game on Gaming Historian a couple weeks ago. Might have to pick it up...   	3

 Those are too useful to be knickknicks or gewgaws, which are more like what you'd buy someone for a souvenir, like a paperweight or a snowglobe.    It's by Voltaire.   http://xserve.volt.ox.ac.uk/VFcatalogue/details.php?recid=6557      I saw that you wrote that and I don't agree. Considering that we're working off of extremely limited information, nobody is in a position to play armchair doctor when there are far simpler and more likely explanations, especially since you seem to be unaware of the fact that some men stink too and they don't have vaginas.    It's much more likely that you're smelling something they ate that tends to hang around and gets exuded (like onions, garlic, fish and curry) than you are smelling their vagina. Or they simply don't bathe often enough, so you're smelling stale sweat.   And this is not limited to women. Men smell bad too all the time for the same reasons.    You're supposed to assume it's a movie adaptation of that same book :P I think I will have to edit that and make it more clear.  I figured that's what you meant, but the answer is the same: depends on the book; depends on the movie. Maybe some book or movie fanatics will say that one is always better than the other but I think that's silly. Sometimes the book might be better, sometimes the movie might be better, and perhaps shockingly, they might even both be equally good. So how can I have a preference without knowing specifically what book or movie we're referring to?   Little weiner dogs, pitbulls, bulldogs (especially English bulldogs, holy cow they're not even handsome)... I don't know, you name it, there are lots of breeds that aren't that cute.   What I was asking was what were the good qualities of the breeds that aren't generally considered cute, but clearly I phrased my question badly.    Today I saw a man walking the cutest, sweetest, happiest little dog and it made me wonder why anybody would want to get a dog that wasn't cute.    Refuse to believe that it's real, not a publicity stunt for the latest Alien sequel.   I've seen it in grapefruits.     Hamotzei meichaveiro, alav harayah.  Great phrase. Never heard it before, which surprises me since it's a very useful phrase for the kind of people that I hang around with.    What age did you learn to read?   No idea. So I guessed.  Do you prefer reading the book or watching the movie?  Depends what book. Depends what movie.   What are the reasons you do not read books  Um, I do read books. Where's the option for N/A?  If you had more free time, would you read more?   Is that predicated on the previous question's assumption that you don't read books?    Apparently it is based on their art, and there are those that dispute that the color was true to life. Now I feel bad about posting this.   Well, TIL that Anglo-Saxon art depicted people with red, blue, green and orange hair.   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_hair  http://books.google.com/books?id=FDKgAAAAMAAJ pg=PA289 dq=%22blue+hair%22 hl=en#v=onepage q=%22blue%20hair%22 f=false   This is how he supposedly kept his promise. There's no way to tell why your family's taxes are the way they are without knowing all the details of their income and situation.  http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/sep/07/barack-obama/barack-obama-said-hes-cut-taxes-middle-class-famil/   Bowel movement is attested by 1874.  http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=bowel allowed_in_frame=0  Sounds like a euphemistic term that the Victorians made up so they would have to say "defecate" or whatever term they used before that.    There's always going to be a opposing school of Jewish thought, saying "there is no debate" is such a concrete statement that it's false on its face.  Not in this case there isn't. Judaism does not joke around with saving a person's life. Life is the number one commandment. (Except for a very few specific exceptions.)  If you have proof that there's some debate on this matter, then show it.    Hasidic families with 15 children and parents who don't want to work because they think it's beneath them  That is not why they don't work. They don't work because they refuse to go to the army and if you don't go to the army you're not *allowed* to work.   (This is a very simplified reason but the point is that it is nothing to do with thinking that work is "beneath" them.)   This is incorrect. If the mother's life is at risk, the fetus is considered a "rodef" (a "pursuer") and abortion is 100% allowed. There is no debate on this matter.   Yes, absolutely. Though that has nothing to do with elective abortions.      I would say, "You're a philistine and I'm embarrassed for you."   If you only read 2-3 books a month, I can't understand why you'd want to major in literature. That's not what I'd call the mark of somebody who's a huge reader. I read 2-3 books a *week* and I didn't want to major in literature. I hope you're planning on changing your major. No sense in suffering through that for four years.   You just watch the movie instead, I suppose. I liked it, at any rate. It's funny but pretty dark and contemplative.    It's not about the "inconvenience," it's about the principle that United is engaging in deceptive advertising and they need to stop. Just complaining and demanding a refund is unlikely to stop them. A lawsuit (regardless of whether the plaintiffs win or lose) is embarrassingly bad publicity and brings the information to people's attention when they might not have known about it otherwise and might have been taken in.   Also, what you missed is that it's not one person suing, it's a class action lawsuit. That means that any money won gets divided up among as many people as sign on. If 10,000 people are named as plaintiffs and they win $5 million it means that each person would get significantly less than $500 after taking off lawyers' fees.   It's called poetic license. Doesn't mean it was well-done in this case, but it's certainly a thing.   My parents never bought antibacterial soap ever and I get a cold at least a couple of times a year and got the flu at least twice. Whether you get sick or not depends on a lot more than whether you used antibacterial soap or not. There's genetics, the health of your immune system, how stressed you are, how often you are exposed to germs, how good you are about not touching your eyes or mouth if you haven't washed your hands recently, etc......   Exactly. A good play will read well and a bad play will sometimes be improved by watching it being performed (but not always). I recently saw and read The Weir by Conor McPherson and it was tedious to read and watch.   As for OP's point, Shakespeare is obviously more difficult for most people than modern plays so naturally it won't be as enjoyable to read.   But OP might like Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead by Tom Stoppard.   You can't make such a broad statement based on reviews of one book. You want to talk Japanese literature, Haruki Murakami is America's darling.   You'll also have to be more specific about what the reviews were complaining about. Could be that it was poorly translated. People said the same thing about Battle Royale so when they reissued it recently, they re-translated it first -- and it still had language problems. They must have cheaped out on paying a translator and editor.   Why do Danny DeVito and Steve Buscemi get massive amounts of upvotes and Cumberbatch none?    My friend loves The Search for WondLa but I found it too derivative.   Skulduggery Pleasant: Scepter of the Ancients by Derek Landy is *slightly* derivative but comes together really well. Recommended.   Read the first paragraph in Wikipedia and it clearly says that the band was a disaster internally and eventually fell apart. That's why they fell in popularity. Nothing to do with the quality of their music or the public's taste in music.

Chicken breast made on a grill, steamed vegetables, potato. Nice, healthy meal, cheap, easy. Simple foods don't need recipes or extensive ingredients.

Scariest books I ever read: Pet Cemetery and Salem's Lot, both by Stephen King.   That definitely helps, but I've gotten gold twice on comments that had content but I didn't think were so much more awesome than anything else I've ever written. So my conclusion is that getting gold is often a matter of sheer luck, that something you say happens to strike a chord with someone else.   I don't know, when was it?   Try /r/poetry.   They accept converts. They may not always treat them right, socially speaking, but you can still join if you really insist. The only group that does not accept converts are Syrians.   Confirmation bias. I don't generally watch people swipe their credit cards but I do see them swipe their Metrocards to get on the train and I can tell you that there is no age difference between those who swipes lightly and those who act like their Metrocard is an ax and the turnstile is a tree they're trying to cut down.   (ones you can join, and don't have to be born into, like Judaism or Hinduism).  You can convert to Judaism.       Here's one theory:  http://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/2v7cut/eli5_why_are_so_many_trophies_and_big_event/  And here's a claim that nobody really:  http://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/1jolik/eli5_why_are_some_sporting_competitions_and/   Whenever I was using airbnb in ny back in the day i was trying to show as much respect to the other people as i would do at home and treat the appartment like it was my own.  Ditto.  Just don't understand the asshats who think that it is ok to be loud and idiots in general  AirBNB allows hosts to rate their guests... I guess this needs to be used more often, or there should be a way of other people in the building being able to rate the guests.    Check out Ogden Nash, then, or any poetry that's considered "light verse."  Here's a list of authors: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light_poetry   Because it's an internal surgical procedure and not comparable to circumcision.   Heh. That explains it.    And people think kicking a button four feet off the ground is convenient in any way? What are they, can-can dancers?  My brain is just not willing to accept that people do this.    I'm really confused. How low is this button or how tall are the people  who've done this that it's convenient to push the button with their feet?    When I searched, this is the only thing I could find:  Conservative rabbis have extended the concept of adultery to include a husband cheating on his wife with an unmarried woman (which does not fall under the traditional definition), and are willing to command a husband to offer a divorce to his wife if she wants one, and to dissolve the marriage unilaterally if he refuses (which would not be permitted under traditional Jewish law  only a man can initiate a divorce).   http://www.theamericanconservative.com/millman/whats-conservative-about-conservative-judaism/   Not much of a poetry reader. I only read these three collections in the past few years:  - Only in the Meantime   Office Poems by Mario Benedetti  - What Matters Most is How Well You Walk Through the Fire by Charles Bukowski  - Introduction to German Poetry edited by Gustave Mathieu and Guy Stern (I highly recommend this)   Not all poetry is like this. Some of it is perfectly straightforward.   Data entry. Medical transcription.    I've heard it was depressing so I've been avoiding it. You didn't think it was depressing?    Seder is a Jewish holiday.  Passover is a Jewish holiday. A seder is a Jewish ritual.   A significant amount of it comes from the outside. Homes that have better seals at the bottom of walls and around doors and windows will have less dust.   You are aware that the Magna Carta is 800 years old, right? When the US Constitution is 800 years old, come back and see if you're still asking this question.   Of course it gets hot. That's why air conditioners were invented. I'm being slightly sarcastic but the point is that they are just like anybody else and when it gets hot, they spend their time indoors where it's cool. They are not like the Amish who shun modern technology.   resistance training. However, it wouldn't be very effective.   It is effective for getting toned. But not for getting ripped.    Ironically a lot of Japanese people think Westerners are the weird ones for obsessing about the weird but rare elements of their culture, and they have a point.  What are examples of this?    P.S. Good canon vs. cannon word play.  Thanks!   I think you've taken the quote out of context and it doesn't say what you think it's saying. In fact, he's saying the opposite. He's saying that if people properly appreciated how good (and sometimes bad) the classics are, they wouldn't be so opposed to novelty and individualism in art. Instead, they've elevated the classics to a sacrosanct canon and artists' new works are "canon"-fodder.   ETA: Gold! Wow, thank you, whoever you are!   Considering that the Flowers for Algernon thread has over 2,000 upvotes and the comments all seem to be positive, I can't see how you think that people here think that liking Flowers for Algernon is so bad. The Green Eggs and Ham thread is just a silly joke that I personally would delete because it adds nothing to this sub, but I don't see it as being mean-spirited.      I read a book once by a survivor who talked about how the Jews in Auschwitz hated Christians because the Nazi's were "Christians" and attended church every Sunday.  Either you are misremembering what the book said or the book has no idea what it's talking about. Take your pick.  The Nazi persecuted the Jews based on race, not religion. The church played little to no part in the active persecution of Jews.  The Catholic Church mostly stood by in silence during the Holocaust while the Protestant denominations were somewhat opposed to the Nazis -- out of self-interest. They were against Nazi control of churches; they didn't care about the Jews.  Here's an article about it: http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10005206   Don't see how any of these things make koalas worse than, say, rats.    Is there a point in life at which watching movies becomes irrelevant?   This is why I love temporary tattoos.   It sounds like therapy might be helpful.    I think I see what you're saying, and that's what they're doing in Kiryas Joel but people from there leave too. I don't think it's possible to isolate people so much from the world that they literally have no contact with it.   TV shows, songs, whatever other formats you can think of.   What does that have to do with anything? Chassidut wasn't founded because life was depressing and they needed a happy spirituality. It was founded because Judaism was in the hands of the elite and this was a way of bringing it to the poor and uneducated. It was innovative and almost rebellious. I'm not sure how it got to the state that it's in today, but conceptually Chassidut has a lot to offer, which is why you find a lot of people who become religious are drawn to the less strict and more spiritual groups like Lubavitch, Breslov and Boston.   Would you say the same thing about the Amish?   In the Bible, Og, the king of Bashan, was said to be a giant.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Og   I don't hate either of them.   I read On the Road in college and it just made me roll my eyes and think *hipster*.   I could never get into Bukowski's novels but I recently read a book of his poetry and some of it wasn't too bad, particularly when he was talking about himself as a kid. But the poems he wrote about being older were more repetitive and misogynistic and ultimately tedious.   I'd say either the Fountainhead or a Thousand Splendid Suns. But if you're going to have to take a test on it or write a report, Suns is probably easier to understand. The Fountainhead is ambiguous and weird at times.   Never heard of any of those people.  She doesn't really seem happy with being a Hollywood actress, taking a break might be a good idea.   Maybe I haven't seen her in enough movies, but what I've seen of her, aside from Twilight, she was terrible. (And I'm not a fan of Twilight, I just happen to think she fit the part very well.)  Who would you consider worse than her?    Her parents aren't in the entertainment business?    It probably helped Kristen Stewart get her start and she's making good money. He father's a producer and her mother is a script supervisor.  I didn't know that. That explains everything.   It's a bit unfair to judge until the person is older but it seems like someone like Gwyneth Paltrow (daughter of Blythe Danner and Bruce Paltrow) tanked while Jake Gyllenhaal (son of Stephen Gyllenhaal and Naomi Foner) seems to be going strong.  So who are some other actors/directors/producers who are the children of other actors/directors/producers whose careers are going well... or not? In other words, does nepotism work out?   I just watched the movie and I don't have the stomach to go through the experience again with the book, so I was wondering if anybody could tell me if the book went into detail about how and why Harry, Marion and Tyrone got into drugs?   Another question: How old were they supposed to be?   And, for anybody who's read and seen both, does the 1978 setting make more sense than 2000? Because the movie definitely wasn't set in 1978 but it didn't quite seem like it was set in 2000 either. More like ~1991.    I'd say beer is less unhealthy because it has less sugar.    birth rates dropping.  If we're talking about the US, the current generation is larger than any generation since the Baby Boomers, plus there is a lot of immigration. So unlike Europe that's in demographic trouble, the US is fine.   They can also eat food, which contains water.    What I have found is that condos tend to be more expensive but have lower maintenance costs while co-ops cost less but have higher maintenance. That makes a difference depending on how much you can afford to put down as a down payment and how much you can afford to pay monthly.   Maybe I'm mistaken, but it looks like it's available unabridged in three volumes. You just have to search for each volume separately, not as a set.   I think we're going to have to get our hands on it before we can comment. From the picture I can't see how it could possibly be a softcover, but most likely the picture is misleading. From a different angle the cover will probably look thinner and softer.    No doubt at the annual dinner it was mostly married couples, but from what I've always heard, dances were held for singles too.    Sure, but as I said above, it's not like it encapsulates the book. It's just the title of one story, which has nothing to do with the other stories.   It's a Russian airline. She could have said this on any of their planes and it would probably be true. There are some Russian (and other countries') airlines that are banned from flying in the US because their safety record is so bad.   Short story collections:  - Salmonella Men on Planet Porno by Yasutaka Tsutsui    - Sex World by Ron Koertge  - Vampires in the Lemon Grove by Karen Russell  Novel:  - Bimbos of the Death by Sharyn McCrumb   I feel like this happens a lot with books of short stories -- they'll choose the best or most outrageous story title and then it'll have nothing to do with the rest of the stories because they're not interrelated in any way.    http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1xpj77/iama_single_guy_who_quit_his_job_and_spent_the/  Sorry, survey wasn't the right word.    This describes the differences. I'd read both. Looks like you can get it on eBay for a relatively reasonable price, you just have to check to make sure it's the original version.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Secret_of_the_Old_Clock   But you aren't going to marry any of those people and if you do, you'll be miserable. Any happy long-term relationship requires all four types of connection, among other things.  Most marriages are indeed not happy ones. They are "happy-enough" ones. And the ones that are miserable usually end in divorce. Some guy did a huge marriage survey and did an AMA on it a little while back. He said that the only happy marriages were between two completely psychologically healthy people. And since most of us aren't completely psychologically healthy, neither are our relationships.   Even though a huge chunk of Russia's territory is in Asia, the vast majority of its population lives in the European part. Native Americans are called Indians because Columbus thought he was in the Indian Ocean when he was actually in the Americas. White comes from a German racial theory of the 18th century.  You may not like these derivations but they're not random and they made perfectly logical sense to whoever made them up.   We do get bored of drinking water. That's why these days they have all these additives to make the water taste a little different without adding too many calories or sugar. Otherwise it's just too tedious to drink too much of it unless we're really thirsty.   Not really. They're all a product of their time. But I would say that popular bestsellers from back then are a lot easier to read than what's considered a classic. The books may not be that great but they can be enjoyable and of historical interest.   For example, Wired Love: A Romance of Dots and Dashes by Ella Cheever Thayer is a silly romantic comedy about a couple that falls in love via the telegraph. Change telegraph to Internet and it very nearly could have been written yesterday.    I found Sherlock Holmes to be difficult and boring and not timeless at all.   That wasn't what OP was asking about.  Yes, for old or sick people, e-reading can be helpful, but most people are not old or sick.   Among young/healthy people you're just as likely to find people who say that reading on a tablet or phone is difficult for them because they keep getting distracted as much as you'll find people who say that they've suddenly started reading more because of them.  And if you want to say that easily distracted people should get dedicated e-readers, we get right back to my original point, that now having a tablet and phone and e-reader generates a lot more waste than books.    Thanks!   The classics are broccoli. The modern authors you mentioned are fast food burgers. Of course they cannot be expected to be written in the same way. Fast food tastes much better than broccoli. But it's still fast food, which means it's cheap crap.   Based on looking at other translations and the original, as far as I can tell, the version you're reading is a very liberal and modern translation. It is not Verne's original style at all.  ETA: Here is a different translation on Gutenberg. Compare for yourself. http://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/3748/pg3748-images.html   In this fast-changing world where the components of a tablet or a smartphone are about the worst pollution there is, as compared to trees which are renewable and paper which is recyclable, do you think it's immoral or selfish for an author or a publishing house to create ebooks when there is old technology that can allow anyone to read without destroying the environment?  Studies have shown that you must keep your e-device for 3+ years for there to be any benefit to the environment over paper books. If you replace your device in fewer years than that, paper wins every time. On average, people replace their device every 2 years.   I agree with this, and I'm stunned at how positive almost everyone else is being. I don't see one ounce of originality, only typical cop tropes and an attempt to mimic some of the elements from the first season.    The information doesn't need to be on Reddit's servers in order for you to be able to click a button that says "sort based on items I have not viewed." Most message boards have this option or some variation of it.   Because reddit doesn't keep track of whatever links you have clicked and which you haven't clicked.  Sure they do. Scroll down. On the lower right is a box of "recently viewed links."   I live on the top floor and I still get this -- from my next door neighbors! Stomping around like they weigh 600 pounds (they don't), dropping bowling balls (?), slamming doors (okay, at least I know what's making that sound, but seriously, dude, you can close your kitchen cabinets without slamming them).   The quote was in A Raisin in the Sun by Lorraine Hansberry, which was published in 1959. ~~One Hundred Years of Solitude was published in 1967. Not saying he plagiarized it, but it's certainly not a particularly original bit of writing.~~  http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/raisin/quotes.html  ETA: And actually, as I'm searching, it doesn't seem to be in One Hundred Years of Solitude at all. The Internet strikes again.   Considering that I grew up loving Nancy Drew and the Hardy Boys and they were ghostwritten, I can't see what the big deal is about James Patterson and the like.   	117
 A big guide? I've been trying to get my ass in gear and make a detailed wiki guide on /r/yugioh101 for weeks. Perhaps you'd like to write some of the missing parts.   Looks pretty cool. I think you'll get more feedback if you submit this to /r/customyugioh   If you're only selling through ebay, then this should be in the [eBay Listings Thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/YGOSales/comments/2rd2bd/ygosaless_official_ebay_listings_thread/).   Is there a joke here? Because the necklace does say mom.   I read the post. I'm just trying to point out, if playing Smash a bit slower gets you bored, maybe you should hang out with more spacie fags or just avoid playing against her.   As long as RNG is used properly, there's nothing wrong with g with it. "What direction should this random chicken go? RNG says 8, so northwest. Now where should it go?" And so on.  But crap like "should I totally miss this enemy again? RNG says 1, so yes. And it keeps saying 1."  And crap like "yeah, your enemy is totally gonna do his almost undodgeable move 3 seconds in instead of 60 seconds in."  There's a right and wrong time for RNG a, and it should always be balanced slightly in the player's favor if it's going to randomly effect difficulty. But, it should never affect if something is winnable. Tester totter around a difficulty level, but not randomly have some shit be really easy and some shot be absurdly difficult.  Candy Crush does it all fucking wrong, AND THEY DO THAT ON PURPOSE. Some people get stuck on level 1. Some on level 14. Some on 212. While some players just breeze past those and get stuck on levels 34 or 56 instead. Who cares? It's random. And King evil-company bitches want you to pay up every time the game randomly sticks you on a level.  Ocarina of time uses the RNG to determine the direction of chickens and Bug's movements. It never makes a chicken impossible to pick up. It never makes a bug go in a random direction when it should go into a patch of soil.  In Majora's Mask (another Zelda game for those who don't know), some bushes drop items or rupees based on RNG. But rupees are never hard to find when you need them. Neither are bombs or arrows or hearts. Especially because some bushes and pots, mostly around soaring points, have definite drops. That's important because when you reset time you lose it all and have to soar right to one of those points. So it's a good thing those points won't screw you over by somehow not dropping what you need.   My punish game is horrible, I combo like a noob, I take too long to convert to KO, my neutral game is crappy, I get one good read per play session, and most of my KOs come from my opponent having south damage and me getting either a good hit or throw.   Are you kidding? I live that I have so much trouble against Zelda. It's a much different challenge than simply trying to play around a faster character. Zelda is extremely unique in that she has the strongest toolset for a control playstyle. Some other characters have defensive play styles. If everyone was just extremely fast and aggressive, the game wouldn't be so awesomely diverse. It may have well been all Fox final D no items mod.  I feel like everybody complains about slower charavters because it makes the game seem slower. But I don't want everyone to play like a super fast power-house of combos. That seems to be the point of all other fighting games, but not Smash which is more about fast thinking on your feet. Speed Chess if you will. Not to say slower characters don't have the potential to be a part of that game, they can be. But just because your character moves a little faster, doesn't make them superior or better to play. And just because a character is slower doesn't mean they're less fun or inherently defensive and annoying.   Bowser love to tank through everything, soo being damage through reading and calling out your opponent on their next move. NEWS FLASH, that's how high level smash is played. Fast or slow, general neutral game is about calling out your opponent and conditions g them to do what you want them to do. Converting later into combos and KOs is how the game is won. The best players are the ones who consistently turn a proper neural game into that all important KO. It's why I suck. I hit plenty, but getting a KO I rarely get against higher skilled players.  If you think Zelda is unfun to play against, play against more Zelda players and learn Zelda's common strats and meta game.

I seriously think shuffling immediately after your fucking draw should be stopped. By everyone. You haven't even had time to see the card in context of the rest of your hand. Wait a goddamn second and look at it before trying to mindlessly change the order to try to see new strategies.

The problems I've had with Reddit apps lie within the things we do most often that Reddit apps don't get. Some of them don't let us edit apps, other apps maybe don't actually mark any messages as "read". Some apps don't let me check mod messages or submit text posts. Some of their UIs suck despite being as good as they can be on such a small screen. And I've even encountered apps that don't even let you browse an individual subreddit. I've even seen apps where I can't sort comments by new instead of best. And basically all apps suck if you're a mod of any subreddit and you're trying to mod on mobile. Not to mention, on most of them I've encountered, you can't even see the sidebar. That's important for a lot of subreddits.  Personally, I can't stand any of these apps. None of them offer everything necessary for an avid Reddit browser. I don't use any of them. I actually browse Reddit on the Safari mobile app.   "Hi, my name's Colin, and I'm from Canada.

Maybe that has something to do with this.      *Yawn and stretch* "What'd I miss?"   I can agree. It's sometimes fun seeing the pathetic bot users who have an absurd amount of channels they follow because they're following a lot of bots and spam that's giving them lots of fake followers. Bots and spam that follow me get reported and blocked because I'd rather have 100 real followers than 1,000 fake ones.  Not to mention, channels like "Best Vines" and "Best Voiceovers" that blatantly steal vines and parts of YouTube videos and never offer any credit. It's best to report these as fake accounts and block them. Same for the channels that try to steal other channels by using the same name and profile image on vine.  And of course, just like Myspace and Facebook before it, *EVERYBODY* is going to look at the number of followers or friends they have as a means of popularity and/or self-worth. It's a horrible mentality. I look at the number of followers I have to see if I'm putting out good content. 107 followers is pretty good for the average user. And hey, if a few of them unfollow me because I didn't follow back, then fuck them.  Don't look at vine as another place of social media. It's actually not that social, and you definitely will run into that group of channels that seem to know each other. And don't be afraid to unfollow anybody when their posts stop being like their old posts. I prefer to follow funny viners, so if someone stops being funny to me, I'm definitely going to stop following them. Yeah, I've been disappointed by looking up "funniest" viners lists and seeing the same viners over and over. The worst part is, some of them aren't even funny, but make jokes toward a niche community.  I wish I could find 20 more people worthy of following, but as it stands right now, I can't find many other pages I want to follow. Meanwhile, I'll continue to post a vine almost every day. I edit all my vines, and I love video editing, so I'm glad I've found a place that will let me do something small for what I love every day.   "How do you know it was him?"  "His left a note saying 'I masturbated on the corpse' on the corpse."   So. All that cloud that was supposed to improve gaming. How's that working out?   The PM homebrew launcher assumes you're using a disc. He's trying to load through USB since his disc drive no longer functions properly.   You're very welcome. I've been using this method for quite a while and have had to figure out what works and what doesn't. As far as I'm concerned, Loader GX and Wii Flow simply don't work.  Don't forget, with updates, you'll need to once again make sure that SD:\usbloader\codes\ has the updated codes file. Using old codes files can cause glitches and crashes. (I unfortunately discovered that from accidentally playing 3.0 with 2.6b's codes.)  Any other problems, just ask. I'm very glad I could help.   Tweaks to Ness to help with his bad match ups like Vs Wolf and Vs Sheik.   Use Configurable USB loader. Before you even start your Wii, open your ad card on the computer. In SD:\codes\ you will see a file called rsbe01.gct. Copy this to SD:\usbloader\codes\.  Now go launch CFG on your Wii. Go to Brawl, but don't launch it yet. Go to the settings. Set "Ocarina" to on and set the hook type to "AXNextFrame".  Save your settings and launch the game. It should boot up directly into Project M.

 Awesome thanks!   Oh thanks that's interesting.

The original publication date was 1958, this is the 1970 reprint. Maybe they didn't change it from the original.         While I agree that the anti-vaccine movement isn't correct, I do understand that for many it is about doing what they feel is best for their kids in line with their own beliefs. I can respect that part of it.  I still try to do the things I wrote about all the time, so I don't think I'm being disingenuous. There are times when I'm required to critique things (UI mockups from the design team for example) and in those situations I do need to look for things that I view as wrong. By practicing what I wrote about however I've trained myself not to **only** look for the things that are wrong.   You are absolutely right! When I wrote this I was very into adjectives, obviously :) I published this to get feedback and I appreciate you taking the time to give it to me. I don't feel as though you were criticizing me or my ideas, rather you were telling me about the problems you found with the writing, which I really do appreciate since writing is both a new and scary territory :D   I find that if I can take 8 large slow breaths and concentrate on breathing I am able to relax and focus more intentely. It totally helps me :)  There are lots of distractions online that can have a negative impact on my thoughts as well.   Yeah totally! I worked on this for a while until I was in control over my own emotions to the point where I knew when I was right in thinking something had fault, as opposed to being defensive and reactionary. Initially though I had a set of thought patterns that I realized I needed to work on. What I found is that even if there is an idea that I don't agree with, that I have reason to criticize, I am now able to find some points that I do agree on. Most of the time anyway :) The times when I can't find a single thing to agree on I can at least agree that the person conveying the ideas is trying and putting in the work to convey their ideas, which is in itself a very positive thing.   "...it takes time to not immediately curl up and get defensive."  Yes, totally this. Great point. It's hard to take time to think before responding. Thank you for the constructive comment as well, you're right that I need to work on my editing :)   I've actually been doing strength training for the last year and I have to say that it really does help. Speaking in front of a mirror is one I haven't tried, thanks for that tip :D   * Do not criticize, condemn or complain, this begins with your thoughts.   * Practice patience, in all things.   * Practice empathy, with everyone.   * Be honest to yourself and then with others.    These are the main things I try to work on and remember every day. I wrote my thoughts down a few years ago and finally got the nerve to [publish them](https://medium.com/@ryanallen_com/become-a-better-designer-and-person-by-learning-to-listen-f23ef9bef9b2).  ---  #Become a Better INSERT JOB TITLE HERE and Person by Learning to Listen    Patient, honest, empathetic, and non-judgemental thoughts will have an incredibley profound impact on your career, your relationships and your overall well-being.  There is no single act or idea that can fix all of your problems. There are acts and ideas that can pivot you into new, and passion-filled life adventures however. This could very well be one of those ideas, if only you act.  Consider how becoming a better listener will help you become a better designer, instead of the designer who argues with everyone and is difficult to work with. Consider how the seemingly simple act of practicing patient, non-judgemental, and engaged listenting will help you become more well-liked, focused, and more aware of frivolous abstractions in an effort to find and move closer to your true self.  How can you do this?  ##Admit When You Are Wrong  To listen with patience and acceptance requires an inner strength to notice your fears and understand where they are coming from, while at the same time actively listening to and engaging, but not interrupting, the speaker. You need to practice and develop the courage to listen with an open mind to other peoples ideas, while also realizing your own ideas may be wrong. To achieve honesty with yourself you must begin by [not criticizing, condemning, or complaining](http://dalecarnegieboston.tumblr.com/post/20350676146/dont-criticize-condemn-or-complain) both externally and internally.  To listen without patience, acceptance, and an honest open mind, results in a tenacity and stubborn resistance to change, with an unwillingness to acknowledge defeat not only to the speaker, but to yourself. This fear is born from your unwillingness to practice courageous mental strength, honesty, and empathy, and prevents you from being flexible in many situations and unable to empathize and grow as a person both personally and professionally.  ##Building a Foundation Based on Empathy, Patience and Honesty  In order to cultivate an empathetic, patient, and fearless open mind, you must begin with empathy. In order to sound honest, patient, and sincere you must be and act honest, patient, and sincere. It helps many people to pretend, make-believe, or act. Eventually it becomes an honest part of you. You will slowly find yourself not having to act, you will just be.  "Im curious about other people. Thats the essence of my acting. Im interested in what it would be like to be you." Meryl Streep  Only when you are able to become more aware and actively use and control your own emotions, will you be able to develop a deep sense of collaboration and respect for your speaker, even if you never fully accept their ideas as your own.  ##Be Honest With Yourself  Before you can become a better person you must practice patient listening. Before becoming a patient listener you must focus on actively accepting the speakers ideas, philosophies, and words by actively practicing empathy with everyone you can remember to practice it with.  What is empathy? You can only begin to understand and actively practice empathy with others by accepting their words, ideas, and ultimately their true being. To do this you must first acknowledge, understand, and then accept your own true being. You must believe in yourself before you are able to accept belief from others. You must believe in the value of your own words, ideas, and feelings before you can believe in another persons feelings, ideas, and words.  You must begin to take ownership of your own actions and admit to your failings. Failures are how you learn.  "Success is a lousy teacher. It seduces smart people into thinking they cant lose.[Bill Gates](https://twitter.com/billgates)  By admitting to your shortcomings and fully owning your actions you will begin to build the solid foundation that is the new you. The better you. The patient, accepting, and wise you.  ##When Two Become One  I told you that you have the potential to become a better person by becoming a better listener, but I havent yet told you how. The answer to that isnt one you will understand by the end of this article. It is an answer that will take a lifetime of practiced social interractions to truly make itself known to you. Interractions where you and your partner, even if just for a few fleeting moments, merge into a singular abstract personality where an almost complete understanding is shared between you.  This understanding takes place in almost every conversation we have. It is a fundamental process in love, patience, and a bettering of our very human nature. Sometimes we are just so intensely interested in our own thoughts that we fail to notice. In summation, remember:  * Do not criticize, condemn or complain, this begins with your thoughts.   * Practice patience, in all things.   * Practice empathy, with everyone.   * Be honest to yourself and then with others          Great job on the different speeds of the background parts, it's a great touch that really adds depth!              	36

Maybe sometime after you found the tape. Do you remember what happened next?  Subject #2907: Im not divulging anymore information until I can make a phone call.  Martin Howard: Say again?  Subject #2907: Im not telling you shit until I can call someone.  MH: Well, you see, you calling someone would defeat your purpose here.  2907: What, I cant get better unless Im completely cut off from my loved ones?  MH: Its a complicated process.  2907: Look, no one knows how my body responds better than I fucking do. And if that date is correct [sound of chair scraping back], if that fucking calendar isnt a joke like everything else is in this goddamn place, then my family hasnt heard from me in over two months. And Id like to NOT be a shitty daughter for once and let my fucking family know that Im not dead!  MH: [NAME REMOVED], please calm down.  2907: Ill fucking calm down when I get a fucking phone call!

MH: Good, Im glad we were able to make that clear for you. Now, lets begin again.  2907: Where?  MH: Whatever significant event happened after finding the VHS tape.  2907: I...went back to the forest.  MH: Which part?  2907: Where I found it. By the [[REMOVED]](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/3dr8qk/languish/)  MH: Did you find anything else?  2907: No. But then I entered the coordinates into my GPS -  MH: What coordinates?  2907: The ones I found under the false bottom of the tin.  MH: You didnt mention that earlier.  2907: You said significant part next.  MH: Yes, I did. [NAME REMOVED], I hope youre not lying to me, or hiding anything from me.   2907: What? Im not.  MH: Because if you were -  2907: I get it, alright? Im just trying to be as accurate as possible. Obviously my brain is a little fucked after everything that happened, so I may forget tiny details here and there.  Is that okay with you?  MH: Perhaps youre being too hostile today. Should we put you back in your room and leave you alone for another day?  2907: No.  MH: Thats what I thought. What did you find at the other coordinates?  [door opening]  MH: Yes, what do you want?

[UNIDENTIFIED VOICE]: Sir, by orders of Lieutenant Kernel Harrison, Subject 2907 may only have forty-five minutes of social interference a day.

MH: Shit. Get the nurses, tell them to bring [REMOVED]. Now!   [recording paused]  [recording continued]  MH: Weekly log for Subject 2907. Subject was uncooperative for most of her session today, but was able to continue after expressing concerns of what she could do to her loved ones. Before we were able to get anywhere, though, her session ended. She was about to be escorted back to her room when she became catatonic, a side effect of the treatments. I do not think she will last long in this facility with how quickly her mental state is deteriorating. We must get her back into the field as soon as possible if we are to reap the fruits of our work anytime soon.   nbsp;  [ERIFTESYDAER](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/3dwcp3/satiation/)  	1
 I wonder what they look like without the black fur around the eyes.   You get about 7 levels per craft to 400, too lazy to work it out    No.  Source: I've checked   A pen and paper, easiest method. ;)   Yeah perhaps you're right about that, I do hope things work out for you two, and don't take advice from anyone who says "End it now" no one can understand the situation better than you or your SO do, although sexting with my GF does feel a little silly when I'm not in the mood.   I've had a period like this for about a month some time ago when I wasn't feeling good about my performance in the bedroom and my confidence in general when it came to sex got quite low because of it and anything to do with sex such as sexting and talking about it just brought me down because I knew I couldn't perform in the bedroom, I don't know if this might be the case with him but perhaps he's just not feeling as confident as he used to be?    Hahaha that sounds ridiculous thank you for the info I'll be steering clear of those two.   Thanks for the offer but I'm not really familiar with the Wirral and I'd probably end up getting lost just trying to find my way around haha   Finally looking to start learning how to drive, any one have any schools they can recommend, not sure of the reputations some have.   No, that's a tree   You've hit the nail on the head here i guess what it is that i'm most scared of was like you said the guy being better at this than i am, i feel like i would take that the wrong way and knock my confidence, it's not an easy decision to make, losing all control and allowing this to happen.  The part you explained about stepping back has really gave me a new perspective on how to look at it, thinking of it that way i don't get as angry as i would normally, i guess i picture myself in the point of view of the other guy and that's not the best thing to do.  I do need to work on my own insecurities and overthinking the situation and i think i can do it, you've helped me out more than you realise but i know i'm not going to change over night, but at least i have a new perspective to think about, thank you.   Admittedly i have had a bad day today so perhaps it seems a bit exagerated, but i don't think your comment is fair, just because i feel this way now does not mean i can't change my outlook by working on it.   Yeah i've thought about that but at the same time i don't want to hold her back from new experiences or myself for that matter!   Thank you for your reply, I'll talk to her about this later on, but i feel like she'll just think i'm simply asking for this for my own pleasure rather than to help with the jealousy, I will try to explain it to her as best i can and hopefully she will understand.  But what if even after my experience i still feel too jealous, i would feel absolutely horrible denying her the experience that i had, and i'm sure she would be upset if i did that after her allowing me to have a threesome with two girls.   So my SO is interested in group sex and i'm not entirely against it myself, but even just the thought of another guy touching my SO makes me angry, like shaking with rage angry, and even if she jokingly says something about another guy to purposely annoy me it REALLY pisses me off.  So i guess what i'm asking is how can I get over the jealousy so we can try new things, i know i'm not ready now but how can i make that first step?   Has there been any mention of what new weapon the necromancer will get? I know we've seen a few in the trailer what else haven't we seen?   Yeah it's good imo, I enjoyed it at least and found it a pretty interesting look into something people rarely think about when they go to Aquariums or Zoo's.    Source?   Rest In Peace in peace photographer      Lots of people i've talked to are reccomending this place, had a look myself it's looking like this might be the place!

A senior student fucked a teacher up the pooper and when he pulled his dick out he swore he had a piece of corn stuck on his dick.   And so it was that Ms.Cornhole was baptised.   ooooo 117 days to my cake day!   **DING** **DING** **DING** WINNER WINNER, CHICKEN DINNER!!   Never that long, by day 4 I would've gotten a couple of matches in at least but not too many. You seem to be severely affected.   It lets me open the app and do a "search" but it never finds any videos and there's none on the home page either. Been like that for months!   Unlike the women officer, screams in fear when he gets the gun out and whilst she's escorting him outside "do you wanna know what page we're on? Step outside, that's what page we're on".....what?   That answers that then. ^^The ^^more ^^you ^^know^^^w^^^^w^^^^^w   You go America!!! hopefully Europe will follow soon. **FUCK PROHIBITION!!**   **ONLY AVAILABLE IN US AND CANADA** ...what a stupid move.   **WHERE IS THE GAME?** I can't find it on the xbox store..   I love cuttlefish but after seeing a documentry on them I fell a bit bad about eating them. They are amazingly intelligent and delicious creatures.   /r/oddlysatisfying   All i know is I would be soooooooo pissed off if my brother and I got that and I was stuck with the boring top bunk.

Now if only my youtube app worked...   Muchas Gracias!!   Dude I just realised your username...I live on your cock.   I'm event hesitant on pre-ordering that one since the fuck up with MCC, but I really want that statue...decisions!!   I'd still prefer the standard black, for $150 I don't want a design I'm going to get tired of.   I knew I'd seen it before!   Step one: acquire windows 10...    ....anddd I failed.   I would not pre-order. I'm in the wrong post aren't I?   **FTFY** Researchers find **that** flatworms plunge their penises into their own heads to inject themselves with sperm.      He's not saying it doesn't take time and effort to build. He's saying it seems cheap and I agree. It's like bringing a gun to a knife fight, it's so over powered compared to all the other battle bots weaponry. It should be made illegal or like I mentioned further up the thread regulated so the props can only be of a certain length therefore removing these helicopter like monstrosities.    How about you regulate the size of shafts on a rotating axis (ie if it's going to be spinning around, it can't be longer than x inches) You would still have spinning robots but not these ridiculous land helicopters of death.   You guys keep bringing swords to gun fights.   If you play with your friends the Hasbro games are quite fun. Risk, Monopoly and now Scrabble has just been released.    The vault isn't "wow" I agree but there are still some good game to enjoy. What else do you want for $30 measly dollar a year?? You lose more than that in change every year and for that price you're also getting 10% discount on any up coming games, it really is a no brainer if you're a gamer.   I get it randomly, sometimes it pisses me off so much I just bash out the campaign but yea I still get it more often than not. TBH I'm done with MCC, hopefully 5 will not be this much of a mess.   Any preview members fancy inviting me to the party??   **Only works for the Americas.** Outside of the continent you need a code.   Have you guys learned nothing?   On a side note, how is the coach co-op on this game?? Are the tiles visible to all players looking at the screen??

 Oh no, there's a cloud of genders giving me an excuse to be at a keyboard right now.  In fairness, I was cooking for most of my recent episodic memory and this feels like a brief return to my daily routine (which is not what I want right now), so I'm gilding the DA hiatus with reddit and wine.   velocity-sensitive keyboard  squeee   And that's why the Christmas Dragon is from Flanland kids ;)   What's the best toy so far?   All the best with the rennies (do try yoghurt too), only Whiskey I can manage is a hot whiskey - I am sacrilege ;)   Just spotted the end of no. 1, my sister hasn't seen the last one so I've another movie on the roster.  My all-time (chosen) movie record on Christmas Day is 7. I'll be nowhere near that today, but hey I can still type so that's new for this hour ;)   So far it's a tasty glass of wine and a fag, got the 'Grand Budapest Hotel' in before the DA deadline.   Also, Happy Christmas!!!   Enjoy!!! I used it to bring an old stereo cabinet back to life, great software!!!   Thank You, Lovely Gave Me Gold Person !!! :)  Happy Christmas to ya!!!!      Happy Christmas!!!   I hope for their sake, none of his children are gay.  As to the article, nobody is forcing the Catholic Church to hold gay weddings. They can keep their doors closed to such things.  I don't think there will be any love lost there.   If you've a Pi to spare, there's [Rune Audio](http://www.runeaudio.com/) - it's only for music, but it plays very well.      I think you're thirsty ;)   True, but nilhilism isn't a word commonly associated with Fascism.  Fascists definitely believe in many things.  It is a word associated with Anarchism though.   The Bill passed without any amendments being accepted by the Government.  Par for the course then.   If something like XBMC is the front-end, wouldn't NFS shares with all the drives be a quick way?  The mutilple NFS drive shares will look like one library to the end-user, if that's the main reason for the 'one big folder' approach.   Also: the Poolbeg Incinerator project, Eyre Square, Greyhound bin services, the stalled Eircode postal system ...     And John Tierney is nowhere to be seen or heard - at this point what does his job actually involve?   She should worry about that when she's in the Dil, plenty done there on an authoritarian basis.   Silly me, thinking Fascism and Anarchism were different things.  I thought Fascism was too much governance, and Anarchism was too little.         Oh, I don't think they'll pick a date voluntarily.  I imagine they'll have made a balls of so many new things, while making a mess of fixing old things, that an early election will be their remaining choice.   I reckon precisely one year could be taken off that.      Ohhh, that's gonna bruise.   Extremely frequent, and most people are better off jumping in at the deep   end, e.g. Paris.  The best way to learn is to have actual conversations, so you've got to stick to speaking French and only ever use English when you can't explain it with any other French you know.  In fairness, I only picked up this skill after sabotaging French - in the pursuit of understanding - while on holiday in Morocco.  I don't think arrogance is the word I'd use either, it's just very easy to sound off speaking non-native French. I'd go for 'weary / scorn'.   I had never thought of it that way.  Frisky bunch those Germanic tribes.             Thanks, I'll have to give that a go!   I think there's an issue with the bootloader that makes dual booting a bit of a pain where one of them is an Android OS.  I remember someone discussing it on the boards, but didn't see it again after that. I could be wrong on that though.   I use Ubuntu and it's the most commonly used I reckon, but there's a decent spread of options and Android too.  I don't remember seeing Arch, I use Arch for my webradio but don't use it much beyond that. (opening downvote umbrella)  You can check them all out here: http://www.odroid.in      I just plug it into a TV and a little HD and I'm good to go :)   Any HDMI port will do.  At home, I've a home server so all the files come across via NFS.  Plus, it's CEC compatible so if I'm just using XBMC then I use the TV remote.  To think last year I was only using a Pi with a HD plugged in directly for my XBMC needs. Now I'm all home-servered up with a completely silent set-up (before the Pi it was a PS3, so the drop in noise levels is much appreciated).  I look back at how I used to do things wondering what kind of digital savage I was back then ;)  The odroid really helped me step up my game.     Not precisely the Pi OS versions, the Odroid chips are different. So you wouldn't be able to flash a Pi OS on an Odroid.  There are loads of OSs to choose from though, even Android if you feel like it - have a look:  http://www.odroid.in/  I've both some R-Pi and odroids, I use the Pi for XBMC, security cams, web radios and I use the odroids for all of those things plus home server, desktop computer and general workhorse.  There's DOSBOX, of course Android games and a whole bunch of other ways to emulate. July's Odroid magazine has more details:  http://magazine.odroid.com/  I love both machines, but certainly the odroid U3 is more useful and I imagine the C1 will really give the Pi a run for it's money.  I don't need one, but I'll have to get one to see how it compares to the Pi. If it's like the U3, then I doubt I'll go back to the Pi for much.   Nah, they're not soldered and are easy to change.  I've 3 U3s and a bunch of eMMCs.  The sd card option is slower but it's a great way to test images.  I definitely recommend getting an eMMC though - they're really fast. All the images on the site will fit on the 8gb eMMC, so you don't have to go for the bigger and more expensive ones.   The U3 is easy to flash, I'm not a dev either.  Just download the image and 'dd' to your SD card or eMMC and you're good to go!   Great, I use it everyday and it's real fast and I've no problems with image quality.   You'll love the upgrade in performance from the Pi, no doubt there!  Miles apart in terms of desktop usage, you're in for a treat :)     You can put Android on the Odroids and get Netflix that way:  http://forum.odroid.com/viewtopic.php?f=94 t=7389 p=58142 hilit=netflix#p58142        You'll have a great time with it I'm sure!  The USB ports are solid, I've been frustrated with the Pi's but no bother with the Odroids.  I've two usb v3 and two usb v2 (via hub) connected to my home server now and it's all good :)  Must resist temptation to get a XU3 now, I've no need for one but ...   I'm over 6 months with it as a desktop, and I love it!  I don't need to stray past Libre Office for my admin stuff (work for myself), all the linux end is a breeze unsurprisingly and it's all really zippy at it.  I do find Chromium better than Firefox but otherwise I can't see much of a compelling difference from the X86s I have and which I'm using less.  I love bringing a little cigarette box size pc, wireless keyboard, HDMI and power-supply around instead of a laptop. I can grab it all in one hand and people are amazed that such a little thing can do so much (though they probably don't realise that their smartphone is much the same thing).  Standard programs open quickly and work well, they need customisation as does much in Libre Office and some GNU apps in general but no deal breakers so far. It's a joy to simply clone a working system and install it for people.  I'm not a database guru by any means, so I'm not going to speak for that. Though if bulk converting XHTML is anything to go by, the U3 is no slouch.  The devices can take mishandling in a way I wouldn't do with a laptop, or a Pi for that matter.  The limitations I've found are linux-general instead of Odoid-specific, e.g. Flash videos, Excel to Libre-office macros etc.  As a home-server, I'm still trying to break it with genuine use-cases. I won't ever go near a shop-bought NAS after using the U3.  I'd say for everyday use, the XU3 isn't needed - a U3 will easily do anything a 300 - 400 laptop will (outside of GPU instensives, e.g. gaming) and take up next to no space.  Plus it's low energy needs means less heat and no fans - the joy of silence.  A remarkable piece of kit for 99 to my door, so I've ended up with 3 of them ;)   It really bothers me that he can't stick to his brief, and can't do anything about proprietary vs. generic medicines in our health bill.  Can we all each take 3 from his health-budget till he improves the health service because I'm bothered about it!? Or would he protest over such a change?     I'm on the flipside, having only seen the movie.  I've read his other books, and I think it will stand his take on humanity - the movie is not a cheerleader for human compassion but is a 'take your warm embers while you can, to keep you warm'.   You're right on the general distro, though to get the most out of the board / chips seems to have involved a lot of "please give us more to go on than a binary blob" etc.  That's a couple of years back now, and as far I can see this issue is largely over, apart from leaving out the open-source ideal.  The Odroid community have filled in the blanks, and some members have really gone back to the metal for it.  For the curious, here's an official img page:  http://www.odroid.in/ubuntu_14.04lts/      If you feel like one of them, then Requiem.  Best dollar that can be spent on a movie, though you'll probably not loan it to anyone after.     Much apologies!!!!   I'm a U3 as desktop user, what are the benchmarks I should run?  I can run a real benchmark now if you'd like on a U3.  There's the usual 'flash' issue but otherwise websites are fine for me.   One placard equals 'in force' ?   I'm typing via a U3 right now as my desktop / surfing computer, have another as my TV pc / XBMC box - and another as my home server which can take much more than I thought it would. Great little things.  Fell hard for the U3, the XU3 looks amazing though I've saturated any need for more mini-PCs at this stage.   The C1 looks very tempting, hard to justify a Pi when this is available. I wonder if this is Hardkernel's response to not getting any more Pi chips for W model.  The only drawback for me is that while the [odroid forum](http://forum.odroid.com/) is great for help and news, it is bewildering for new-comers.  Finding the latest images / software can be a pain without checking huge threads to see if there are patches or better solutions than the immediately obvious links. There's a lot of cruft left over from previous versions and solutions which I think should be archived off to a distinct section of the site.  That said, I wouldn't be without them now.  For those who are thinking of taking the plunge, do go for the eMMC options over the SD card. The SD card is fine, and is a handy way to test images etc but the eMMC is much more pleasant once you've settled on an OS, set-up etc. The images will all go on an 8gb eMMC.  I gave one to my non-techy brother as both an XBMC tv solution and a TV pc, loves it and with the little wireless keyboard I gave him more than able to navigate around.    Sure, would ya not have smiled at them a bit too - being a happy Garda and all ...   Charles is Oliver's son, the West Korea route to a Dil seat.   Is there an xkcd about physical access vs. remote access?   I paused at 30 seconds, will certainly watch. Thanks!  And I'm certainly not going to mention S****el    Never Let Me Go - http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1334260/  Requiem for a Dream - http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0180093/      Never Let Me Go   I'd their radio internet my first time with them, I lived in the sticks, then went fixed line once I'd moved.  All hassle-free, just told my landlord what Digiweb needed to do to the house - he was thrilled at the idea of an upgrade out in the boonies. When I moved Digiweb uninstalled the receiver etc. from the old house.  I checked with Eircom when I moved to that old house and their answer was a flat-fee of 300 "for works" although the wiring was complete so I would have paid that cash simply for activation.  The landlord wasn't going near such a bill - and neither was I.  There was even a dial-tone when I plugged a phone into the obvious socket in the house.  And so my dislike and distrust of Eircom was born.       I'm not sure how true this still is (or was) but a French friend told me that come results time and assuming a minimum achievement in grades, students went to the universities they liked and basically queued for the courses they wanted to enter.  The completely unsuitable were weeded out by the 1st year exams and too bad for them then - they were gone.  It sounds like a nightmare, but also sounds like those stymied by choices made in school have a chance to redirect their trajectories rather than sticking to what their 5th year subject choices confined them to.  I made a mess of uni the first time, and it wasn't until my mid-20s I decided to try again. Much better then.  Sometimes I wonder if a deferment for a year, combined with a tax-break on any work during that year towards future education fees etc. would really help students choose a course they genuinely want, while giving them a very good reason to enter the workforce first.  That year of work being the impetus and awareness to pick a course they really wanted, rather than being swept along with the pressure to get a degree first then experience later.   Digiweb, some people don't like them - but I've had next to zero problems with them.   Digiweb, they gave me the first month of fibre free too - as I've been with them so long.    I've been ~10 years away from Eircom, absolutely no regrets.  I got fibre installed one week after I called, whereas my neighbour went with Eircom - it took 3 weeks to get the installation, then 3 months to actually provide him a stable connection. It just dropped every hour or so on him, and was nowhere to 30mbits they promised.  Same lines, same junction box - totally different service.      With a little sprinkle of internet shaming ...   Yeah, it isn't really much better.  Though maybe it's a start from where real rules can be created, rather than non-retrospective 'guidelines'.  I should have known at this stage to expect little from our government but window-dressing, and a rule change which sounds like it should effect one FG's biggest supporters / donors yet it really protects him from his competitors.   The final rules will not apply retrospectively  Still, better than nothing I guess.   I have an all-white (wall-painted) space, and while that's a lovely apartment, the lack of colour via posters, prints, rugs, cushions etc. makes it look like a showroom or corporate rent rather than an actual home.    But then we'd have to gag newspapers prior to court cases, and judges can instruct juries to disregard previous / current reports and only focus on facts presented in court.   Fantastic news, that's a definite buy for me!   If you want off-beat / art-house / European then:  www.mubi.com  36 for a year of all you can watch.  Closer to home, there's:  www.volta.ie   obsession  It's just another subject, I was coding at 8.  It didn't all take, neither did German, Biology or Accounting - general life things there too.   To reveal the target and methods in court wouldn't make sense, but to hide the fact of the court case is the thing that really worries me.  Tell the judge 'in camera' about the details, but the fact of a foreign government requesting Irish data from companies should not be hidden. We should be able to see how many times it happens, and whether it's getting worse year on year.  I guess this will make the US government's case against Microsoft for data held on their Irish servers much easier too.  I can really see now why Fine Gael have never been elected to Dil governance twice in a row.   Thanks!  I suppose that would only leave this bit:  The companies would be prosecuted in secret, and would be unable to disclose their objections publicly  or even the fact that they were being prosecuted  That sounds very unusual to me, are such gag orders common?  Those I suppose by their nature that can be hard to determine.   The provision for the secret courts is exceptionally unusual.  Even with very sensitive cases in Ireland theyre not prosecuted in camera, said TJ McIntyre, lecturer at University College Dublins school of law and chairman of advocacy group Digital Rights Ireland. Its worrying because it means telecommunications companies might be pressured into doing things that arent entirely legal.  The companies would be prosecuted in secret, and would be unable to disclose their objections publicly  or even the fact that they were being prosecuted.  My hope (foolish I guess) that Fitzgerald would clean up Garda corruption has just completely vanished.  It took a hit when O'Sullivan was appointed commissioner, but secret courts now, much worse than the Sherblock.  Where I wonder does the Lisbon treaty sanction secret courts?   But the dual-wield in 2, it's swapping in 1   Or in other words, I haven't added as many 'publishers' to my 'only-2nd-hand' list as I have this year.      10% of a sector is massive  Indeed, it's also not a "huge percentage" - it's a significant percentage.  My point being that Irish companies (the vast employers) are at a competitive disadvantage because of loopholes they're not big enough to exploit, while MNs are.  We could have a home-grown eBay, Google etc. but we'd never get past the start-up phase as the tax decks are stacked against.  12.5% is great, let's keep it that way and let's have a free-market that obeys it. That's competition isn't it?    Ah, too up to stop - too fatigued to dance.  Foot-taps then finger-dancing should be along in 20   20.    It gets a lot of disdain, but isn't nearly as bad as its reputation.  The controls are better in 2, the story is decent in 2 - but the story is not as good as 1.  I wouldn't skip it - you'd miss the Big Daddys' counter-part!   The latest figures I can see are [161,000](http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/01/03/ireland-investment-idUSL6N0KD1L320140103) multinational employees, out of a total workforce of [2,170,984](http://www.tradingeconomics.com/ireland/labor-force-total-wb-data.html).  The usual figure given for multinational employment is between 25   30% - though as we can see from the total labour workforce it's ~7%.   [2009 Data - "Employment in foreign-owned multinationals accounts for about 9.5% of private sector employment in Ireland"](http://eurofound.europa.eu/observatories/eurwork/comparative-information/national-contributions/ireland/ireland-multinational-companies-and-collective-bargaining)  Even at 25%, the vast majority of Irish people are employed by Irish companies who would struggle to get a team of accountants and lawyers together to avail of tax loopholes in the same manner multinationals do.  It's funny in these online debates, I always see people who claim multinationals are major employers. That's not the case, the major employers in Ireland are Irish people   companies.   This is about loopholes reducing their bill, not low taxes.   Except nobody speaks Etruscan any more, Irish isn't a dead language, you're not forced to speak it or use it, and there are no *demands* that you pay for it because it's an official language just like English which I imagine you don't possess a bill for speaking.  So, what was your point again?   kif.gif   Would it really be that hard to cross-ref age ranges, clerical / political careers and geographical advantages?   I'm just asking for facts.  And Drumcondra is exactly where you need to go asking   about protecting identities  I can't take that seriously:  ["As charted by the Murphy commission, the complaints of parents and their children were ignored and other families placed in immediate danger as prelates from John Charles McQuaid onwards suppressed scandals and **took refuge in canon law to protect offenders at the expense of children**."](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murphy_Report#Emphasis_on_the_avoidance_of_scandal)  Are you trolling or naive?  Brendan Smith worked in my school, briefly. He got one though.  Two christian brothers that worked permanently in my school were shipped to psychiatric units instead of prison, though they had to be kicked out of town for feeling 1st years up beforehand - the 'Boiler Room' we called it.  As for McQuaid, ask men / grandparents (then boys) who went to school near Drumcondra during his reign what they thought of him - they'll know exactly what second floor of a building I mean.   What do you recommend we do in '15?   Except Irish isn't the antecedent of English and our oldest documented history isn't written in English either.   Are typos and miscommunications the same thing as inaccurate translations of an official language by the department in charge of that language?    I don't agree that a debate in an elected assembly is a kangaroo court.  Is an elected assembly in the Dil a court?     Seriously?  [The department aided this culture "through infrequent, toothless inspectors" that always deferred to the Catholic's church's authority, the report said. The inspections even failed to ensure that children were adequately fed, clothed and educated.](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/may/20/child-abuse-catholic-schools-ireland)  -------------------  [Irish taxpayers are to fund most of what is likely to be the largest payout from public funds to child abuse victims anywhere in the world.

To be also fair, other government websites aren't responsible for the 1916 centenary.   If it was any other department a bit of leeway would be fine, this one though!  Our new department head hasn't been settling into the role very well.

He insisted that legislation was the correct way to enshrine any such provision, and to "make sure that all the parties, come the next manifesto [for election] have this as a key promise."  So rather than a constitutional certainty, we should settle for a manifesto promise!?  This is not the clarity I'm looking for.

 Here you go :) http://we.tl/xLqr1tUfHN   How do I do that? Can I just zip the save file and upload it somewhere?   Initially, the hour glass shape was the mob farm, but it didn't work because it was too low (monsters would spawn in the caves below, not in the farm) so I made another mob farm on top of it, the upper most part is the chamber where they spawn, with 4 8-long and 2-wide canals that lead to the hole in the middle. And yes, sorry, everything was done with vanilla minecraft.  EDIT: Monsters spawn within a range of 144x144 according to the video I watched, but they only move when you're in range (about 32 blocks). Yet if you are to close, they don't spawn, I think they spawn when you're 24 blocks away. So I made sure that the floor of the dark room on top was 30 blocks above the floor where you can kill the mobs. Because it is so high up (the collecting floor is 72+ above the ground, to prevent monsters from spawning below) and I put torches on the ceiling and the collecting floor, they are forced to spawn in the room.   In the room, there are 4 canals leading to the hole in the middle, which are 2 blocks deep, in order to prevent the mobs to escape. At the bottom of the tunnel, i put slabs in order to kill the monster and prevent spiders from escaping.   This is the video which helped me a lot: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=liYHNsXTcBc    Thanks :)      	5

I was recently having a conversation with a friend of mine about this. He was upset that Trestman went to the Ravens. He was talking about how he should come home to the Browns, the history of Trestman in Cleveland, and eventually why we cant get those guys to come back. It finally hit me during that conversation. As much as I hate the Ravens when you ask the old timers to come back and help the Browns, their friends arent in Berea. When they think of the old times, they think of Ozzy Newsome and the staff of the Browns Pre-95. All of Trestmans friends from the old days are in Baltimore.

No. Totes was MadLibs. Check it out "You can *Verb* my *Noun* and run your *Noun* around the rim of my *Noun*".  All jokes aside, I just thought it was interesting. Hence the part where it says Coincidence? Yes.   This is the thought that has me caught up. I really like the white ones too. I think they're sharp. I'm just a nostalgic goon and love the Seal Brown. Maybe I'm not looking at things correctly, and I should realize the white uni's aren't safe and may be gone next year, too.   True story. We have 2 Joe Ha(y)dens on the Browns. They are also arguably our 2 best players. Coincidence? Yes.   I am going to get one more jersey before we change to the new style. I already have a Seal Brown '40' that was given to me with "Hillis" scraped off and my name stenciled on as a gift (First Jersey) I then bought a Seal Brown Cribbs '16' and a Seal Brown Haden '23'. I pretty much know that I want a Thomas '73'. The question is, do I want to go Seal Brown again, or do I go with my first White Jersey?   I want the Seal Brown because I worry we wont have them next year, and I think I will still be able to get a white jersey next year. But I dont have a white jersey, yet, and I think Thomas might be really sick in White.   Suggestions?   I have heard from a buddy in Nebraska that he wasn't dirty at all in college and in fact had a large and positive following online.

This.   I live in Seattle and another win would mean another [huge ass, polite, party](http://youtu.be/Qo4z77OvznU)   I am the most badass epic legendary neighbor. Here is my story:  I moved into the most beautiful neighborhood near Atlanta, GA. Historic Druid Hills across from Emory University. My house was perfect in so many ways. I had my own room with attached smoking porch, a gourmet kitchen, roommates that I loved, music, fun, parties, pets. It was perfect. Until 10pm every night. I lived next door to this horrible old woman and her 90 year old mother. We shared a driveway that split at the end into each of our yards. Once noise ordinance set in, the police calls would begin. It was a never ending, revolving door of police visit after police visit.  Listening to classical music and cooking a late dinner? Police.   Laughing at a game of Apples to Apples and watching Craig Ferguson? Police.   But the night that changed me was the night I came home from working 3 jobs at 11pm. I was, in this order, a Lumberjack, Mexican Restaurant Waiter, Gormet Pizza Chef for Everybody's Pizza  and my day started at 6am.  All I wanted was a milk shake. Sometimes all of life's problems can be solved, at least in the moment, with a milkshake. All of the sudden I hear the 3 hard knocks of an irate police officer. I answer the door holding the blender.  "Hello, Officer. What is it this time?  He points to my blender.   "Your blender"  I must have looked at him in a really messed up way, because he gave me this 'Don't shoot the messanger' look with his hands up, and said  "Look. Just be quiet over here. I sat outside and you aren't doing anything technically wrong, but she is going to call us every time she hears you and we are  going to have to respond"  So, being at the end of my rope, I asked a question.   "What time does ordinance lift?"  "5am" he replied, and turned on his heel to leave. I nodded, closed the door, hand stirred the rest of my milk shake, went to bed, and set my alarm.  5am came slower than Christmas. Once my alarm went off I sat up, combed my hair, brushed my teeth, got dressed, and removed my trumpet from its case.   *it should be mentioned here that OP played one quarter of a year of trumpet in 5th grade.*  I made my way out to where the split in our driveways began. Standing just on my side of the property, I faced her house, and began the most discordant, obnoxious, sonically discombobulating, racket I could muster. After a solid 2 minutes, the meanest, morning faced, most mad, vile, fist clenched, woman you have ever seen comes charging out of her house at me. I can tell that she has probably just gotten off the phone with the police, and has been informed that noise ordinance lifts at 5am  "STOP IT STOP IT STOP IT!!!! YOU STOP THAT RIGHT NOW"  At this point she is stomping and spitting and her hair is starting to unspring from her head, and I put my trumpet politely in her face and blow it as hard as I can while attempting to play as close to a 26/33 cadance as I can get. She runs back into the house and a few minutes later comes back outside. I like to imagine she called the police again to tell them what happened and they  politely told her to flake off, hung up the phone and laughed to each other about the field this lady was reaping from her actions.  Once again she beelines over to me and tries to take my trumpet. I pull it away and jut my face towards hers.  "If you touch my trumpet I'll have you arrested. You want to own the night. I own the fucking day"  And for a solid week my trumpets calls could be heard all the way to the CDC. *EDIT Spelling*   I live in Washington. It's true. You have to get money from the ATM for the dispensaries.    I did not expect such an amazing reaction to these!  Maybe I'll share my Batman comic I wrote. Not doing me any good since I can't get anyone in DC to look at it. At least someone would read it. Lol!

Here's to a new year and a continued upward trend for the Browns and this Sub!   *Hides his Team Shaw shirt behind his back* Yes. Me too.   My side of this is more about a particular way that person expresses their side. See, I'd love for the sub to have less all caps screaming posts about Manziel not getting a fair rub, (over and over by the same person) and if they are done, I will be too.   /u/740Buckeye is too enamored with ManChild to give a real answer to this. Hoyer is worth money, and someone is going to pay him. #JayCutlerClevelandSuperBowl2015   I love the class, you know? He gives the middle finger to the camera, but just one, and he leaves his hand loose. It shows he isn't uptight, you know? I'm so excited that he represents our team. Class. Act.   I think you mean the top 3 teams that need a QB have the 1st, 2nd, 12th, and 19th pick.   Everyone is behind Manziel, giving him the D.   LOUD NOISES!    Biggest flop in the NFL is Manziel.   We are in desperate need of a quarterback.   Never got banned, sunshine.   Your tears make me happy.   I got you some clown shoes to wear.   Shurmer or Mangini, eh? Go Raiders. *Edit: Sarcasm font*    It's from his rookie year, and I think it looks pretty beastly too.   I think that this article nails it on the head. This front office/coaching staff is amazing. The movement to ManChild was perfect in its timing. We had enough time to see what he could do. Even after that shutout, the choice to play him again was the right decision. Connor Shaw was the correct decision for the Ravens. I'm more than satisfied with our infrastructure and the choices they have made. I trust, for the first time in modern history, that they will field the best decisions available to them.   Gratzi.   Are hazel eyes really an evolutionary mystery?

 Fair enough. Agreed.   Maybe you are right, but I'd argue that there are very few names that get remembered over time (this is not to say Villa is bad).  Just consider Spain alone, in the past 10 years or so, I'd say Xavi, Iniesta, Casillas, Raul are bigger names than him (not comparing skills here, just saying these names are more well-known), and probably Puyol, Ramos are at his level. There you've got 7 or 8 names already for that decade, so in 50 years basically there would be 40 or so players of, roughly speaking, his level or better. I doubt anyone could remember 40 names from one country (even if it's your country) unless if something special happened that made you remember him.  And plus, people tend to remember more recent players and forget old ones. How many players from the 1960s can you name?   What's his name, by the way?   Before you ask this question, you will need to define what legend is. If we are taking about legend as in someone who is, at some point, one of the best players for a top country/club, then I think he is. But if we are talking about legend as one one who could be remembered/recognized 30 or 50 years later (e.g. Maradona, Zidane etc), then I think no.   It's just for fun, don't take it too serious.  And, they are actually pretty good for US   Canada.   I am glad that you say your are here to learn than to get higher marks. As a TA myself, I am really glad to hear students say so, and personally get motivated by that (to teach better). But unfortunately, this is life and you must realize that the University, in general, don't care very much about undergrads.      What I mean by easier is also not to say the learning is easier. But generally speaking, summer instructor will tend to keep marks slightly higher, for various internal reasons.   When you have time, go to a library you like that mostly contain books not from your subject. Spend some time there and read random books. This is both entertaining and fruitful, because too many people these days only know their subject and nothing more.   It's true that that PhD student are usually bad, but not always.  I am a PhD student myself and I get rated highly by my students always. Students often secretly tell me that I am even better than their instructor. So, don't assume that every PhD student is bad :)   Summer instructors are usually bad, but easier.      Anyone here cheering for Williams?            What I meant to say is that Wired is a decent source for tech news, so I wouldn't say what they are publishing are rumors just because I have not heard about it myself.      I don't know, but do they have to show it to the public in order for this statement to be true?   Oh, that's a surprise. I always thought the chess players are supported like the Olympic athletes. Guess that's not the case.      Well said.  I think as a Chinese player playing at his level, the state will have an important say on your career, perhaps even more than you and your family. The state may make certain decisions and "recommend" those to you. So yeah, not saying that he will necessarily do well, but he definitely won't be like Josh Waitzikin, who just suddenly ditched chess.   I like this one! Will add it in now.   Maybe this has some truth to it. Tradition chess countries like Russian and Ukraine seem like talent-lacking at the moment, so maybe yeah, the Chinese and Indians may have a chance (India has a really talented player as well I think, forgot the name).   Agree. I think traditional tech companies are all retreating back into their core businesses. IBM is the other example.      Original Source: http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/247659  1.

Essential, if I am understanding correctly, contango is when t futures price (or forward price) of a commodity is higher than the expected price today. So basically, does that mean if the price of some commodity stays constant, the price of their futures will still drop because of contango?  How does this affect non-commodity futures such as VIX futures? Do they suffer from contango as well? If so, does that mean the price of VIX futures will drop even if the VIX index remains constant for a period of time?  And finally, what futures are examples of backwardation?

But you know, I guess it's hard for people from non-English universities to publish in top journals, so maybe he is a bright guy but doesn't have lots of stellar publications. I think he has some books that are well known.   You are right, I think it would just be out of shock value to keep people watching.      Good game, congrats! Your opponent played a weird game.         Good point! I totally agree.   did you watch the episode?      Zaza will prove to be worth the value, I think.         Reading this from Wikipedia: Bloomberg said that Varoufakis was a "brilliant economist"  Galbraith, referring to Varoufakis's expertise in game theory, has said that he knows as much about this subject "as anyone on the planet"  So, does he have really good publications?   The toilet is broken, that's probably the only reason why I would not flush.   I would say your best blitz rating on chess.com (I am guess mos people play blitz) would be roughly 100 points higher than your FIDE rating and maybe 0-50 pts higher than your USCF.   Soon Wei Yi will be a challenger to Magnus Carlsen.   I think scientists have also genetically engineered some other animals to glow. Remembered reading about this before.   This is a really interesting concept, kinda like massdrop.   I know that is the case, but why is it, for example, that Argentina and Brazil have good men's team? Do they have more talented men than women?   For example, USA has the best women's soccer team, but their men's team is nowhere near the top. Countries like Canada, China, North Korea, Japan also have far better women's teams than men's teams.         Sorry for that. Perhaps try again? It worked fine for a lot of people, I think.            Varrock is my pick.      You spelled Buffon's name wrong. Should be Gigi Buffon not Gini Buffon.  	67
                                    think more so than timing is the way the post is titled.

 I did some research. Is there any pertinent info you would give a first-timer? Sounds like a great place!   Peru and Colombia both sound amazing. Do you have any advice on hostels??  	2
 On the surface, it is ridiculous.  Corporations are started by people and granted authority to exist by government.   Wow!  Do I wish I could draw like that!   I don't remember it being $1 ever.  It was about $10 in 1970.   Just beautiful!   2400 customers is unbelievable.   Is there a link here?   Remember when they quietly changed the rules of benefiting from inside knowlege on stocks?   Inspirational.  I wonder if it had as much to do with his coach.  I grew up here also and never felt that way.   If you do have her come, have her contact Nevada Partners who are located in the same building as the Culinary Training Academy and they will help her by  paying for the training.   Pelosi passed a ton of bills.  The Senate had 60 votes for only a few months.        Not now, but thanks.  Have a great night!    About 9 hr drive from Vegas in northern Nevada, but the Black Rock Desert where they hold Burning Man each year, is incredible:   http://search.aol.com/aol/image?q=black+rock+desert v_t=client96_searchbox   About 9 hrs drive from Vegas in the Black Rock Desert, but the geyser looks incredible:  http://t0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcTSl0pgd1dYdtqoxZzobjQCtp6NLW-JEPyX4e_8qCifuOs4q4BZGC_Yris   It is worth seeing.  I laughed so hard it hurt.  I bought tickets during the presale too, but ended up being at 5 or 6 rows from the top.   Not necessarily related to polling, but President Reagan was not popular when he left office.  (I don't remember the numbers.)  Some republicans freaked out and funded a campaign to improve his image.  So, for years, there has been a well-funded effort to name places after him, write articles that made him look like a great president, etc. etc.   I like it.   I don't know.  Unions are able to turn people out to work in campaigns; they spend money and turn people out to walk precincts, make phone calls, GOTV.    I want to be there right now.   It's so sad.  I hope it doesn't dry up and that we have a good El Nino year with lots of rain.  And good snow this winter in the Rockies.   Beautiful photo.   Dual goals.  Works.   That's what Brock said.   Just the hypocracy.   I love it!   Yep.   I wish they would join rather than fight us.   I couldn't get much from the article.  I would like to know more.  At the time, I heard that all the jobs that were supposed to be created in Mexico went to China instead.   Even worse are those SSI, SNAP and TANF recipients wail on on how much they hate assistance.  They deserve it, but no one else does.   One of my favorite books was Blinded by the Right by David Brock.  He was paid to help bring down Bill Clinton, but saw the light and started Media Matters.  He also outed Matt Drudge who is still the right-wing source for news.   We talk about sugar and fat, but I wonder what these antibiotics do to increase our fattening.   Conservatives hated the student protests of the 70's, and they blamed the professors for teaching liberal ideas.  They systematically worked (and there could be multiple ways to do this) to increase the costs of studies to restrict enrollment in schools and  to keep students and graduates so indebted that they would stop liberal arts studies and wouldn't have time to protest social injustices anymore.  They also worked to stop professors from getting tenure (where they could say what they believed without threat of losing their jobs) to adjunct professors who could not even support themselves any longer.   Beautiful job.   I think it will change, but I spoke with a company at a fair and it basically came down to that I would need a new roof, new windows and doors and new siding on my 55-yr old house before I could even consider solar.  LOL.  It would cost me the entire value of my house to prepare it for solar!  And I live in a neighborhood whose residents could benefit from solar.   Sorry, I should have posted this sooner.  c3connect.com was hiring 500 people this week. You were to apply online, then go to their open house at about 7830 Las Vegas Blvd. So. for interview.  40 hrs/week x 10/hr for customer service. Training starts 7/7 or 7/11.  Also paying $100 to each person giving a referral and $200 to that person if the new employee stays 6 months.  Not sure how many positions they actually filled this week, so you may still want to apply online.  Just made some corrections to this. Also, they are still having open interviews next week Monday - Thursdays also.   I agree.  I think that exposure and empathy is also valuable.  I would rather know people that TRY to do good than one those who didn't try or care.  Maybe it is possible that this gets translated into helping less fortunate at home when they return.   Also, we had a civil war over states rights (which was a really the right for states to decide if they could have slavery).  This war was fought and won, but they are still fighting for states rights.     It says alot that 90 percent of the republican party is white.  Source: "Dog Whistle Politics".   What else is new?   Especially in the bathroom!   There is a company that is hiring 500 people by Friday.  You need to apply online, then go prior to Friday for interview.  I have their location at my office but it is on the 6000 block of Las Vegas Blvd. So. Maybe you could call and get their address.  They are interviewing and hiring on the spot.  40 hrs x 12/hr.  At least it is getting back into the work force.  http://www.c3connect.com/   Check history.  Republicans may reduce taxes, but create huge deficits that Democrats  have to clean up.  They usually spend great amounts on the military.   This is not a little kid - but I just learned a few years ago that pickles were pickled cucumers.  Never knew that... Duh.   A lot of hotels will hire felons IF they are upfront about it in the application.  We had a list at work and I updated it once just by making phone calls.  Have him call HR departments before he applies.   Looks like fun!    The south already lost one civil war.   I'm curious if you are looking for work, and what kind?   Dr. Zhivago is my favorite movie.  The expansive scenes, beautiful music.  I never read the book or knew of the history behind it.  Thanks for the post.   It has been years since I read the book.  I loved the book until the end.  I didn't think the book led to the same conclusions as the author.   What an idiot.   Naked Gun.   These are the types of things that turn me off towards conservatives.   I'd have to do a search, but I remember reading someone was arrested for using a two dollar bill. I used to see them occasionally but bit recently. I'd love to have one!   $$$$      Just looked at the heading, but this is sick.   I remember an article that corporations were all getting their share, although the article specifically mentioned Toys R Us.   It's also the biggest contributor to the Democratic party.  Kill unions, Democrats cannot compete for big donors.  They have some, but not nearly enough for parity.  I really believe this is the main reason they are under attack.   You are right. It's just that we are viciously attacked when we try to make this distinction.   Their form of libertarianism is to tell others how to be. All you have to do is to look at the anti-women, anti-gay legislation being enacted in red states. They are religious fanatics. I don't care that they practice their religion, but don't try to put it on everyone else either.   Why do conservatives consistently support the one percent who are as a whole as corrupt as you can get?   Yes, the most of the rich want everyone else to work for pennies.   I'm so tired of it too, and then I think of these crazies trying to tell ME how to be.  I don't mind if they live their own lifes the way they want; just don't prevent me from living my life too.     Quit my job and take a much needed vacation to recover!  Who knows after that - some type of philanthropy.   There is no left wing radio.  I hate these equivalencies that just don't exist.  The left wing in America is centrist, not radical at all.   I want to know also.   Who was buying bonds when they offered 0 yield?   Let them eat cake!   I don't understand how they can remain in the same party.  Libertarians are the exact opposite of the religious right.   I appreciated your story.  We are not all perfect and to be successsful in reaching your goals is great.  Any kind of motivation helps.   Think it might be from Fukushima?   We could use some shaping of behavior - in terms of global warming - which may end up costing us a lot more in the long run rather than short term gains.   I'm not so sure. The PBS series Nature just had a show on crows who are exceptionally intelligent. They said they had a particularly large brain per body size. They mentioned other animals or mammals and said it was the ratio of brain to body size that determined intelligence. They probably meant as a species not an individual however.   I think you can get the parts at Home Depot or Lowe's, or google for other parts.   The original looked so much cooler though, but I heard that was the reason when they changed it.   I'm interested. Not sure how so keep me informed.   conspicuous consumption.      I hate to see this comparison.  There really is no left in this country.  Our left is center and it goes right from there.   The RJ had an article a while back giving 50-50 odds that it will dry up by 2021.  I've seen some photos of the lake near Sacramento that is dry, and Lake Shasta is also dropping fast.  One hope is that we have a good El Nino this year. http://www.reviewjournal.com/news/study-gives-50-50-odds-lake-mead-will-dry-2021   Not sure it was bad for me, but I wish now that I did summer sschool and graduated a year early. That would have been cool.   And he did this while still a candidate.  Wasn't even president then.   It gets so old.   Thanks!   So true.  I've seen that so many times.   I watch jobs as they come out.  I have seen a bartender apprenticeship job advertised in the past week - not sure if it was through MGM properties or Stations, but keep trying.  You usually have to start as a bar back.  There is a bartender's union also.  Not sure if they are accepting new members, but it might be worth a call to check them out or to see what they recommend.  This is not a job, but the best I can think of right now.      How did the big tiles work out?   I've been looking at shower tiles and my husband wants me to get the 4x4 tiles.  By the way, it looks great.  You did a good job!   I read about the group out of Washington DC (Mt Pleasant) that started a buyers coop and with tax rebates, were able to get the price down to 1500 per house. I live in LV too. Don't think there are any tax rebates available today, but I'm sure we could do better.  We ought to brainstorm.  I couldn't find the original article but saw a newsletter that said it should cost from 5000 - 7000 now per house.   Basically, that's what FDR did.   People don't remember Daniel Ellsberg from the 70's.   Beautiful.  I love them!  I only wish I had enough to do one book.  I am recommending them to a friend who has traveled their entire life.    http://www.meetup.com/synshop/      That's the other problem.  The Chrisitan right believes in faith, not facts.   It is getting tough.  We had a doctor tell my husband he needed surgery when he needed a dentist.  I've had dentists tell me a group of my teeth needed to be taken out - and years later, I still have the teeth.  There is a book called "Trust me - We're Experts" about how lawyers bring in experts for both sides who contradict each other - for a fee.  There is always someone in there for the cash.   I try to look for friends or knowledgable people who are not looking for gain for guidance.   Is it a contest?   Travel outside of the country before I was married. I also wish had been bolder in my dreams, worked harder to achieve them.   Me too.  I'd walk in a minute.   Doesn't defy physics, but I love them.    Doc Martin, MI5.      Looks great.   What else is new?   Immediately.   Get names and years on the photos.  Ask about their parents and relatives.   I have these photos and don't know who is who.   I appreciate both of your comments.  I think about this ALL of the time, and how we can bring them around.  We are not dealing with a whole group of issues that can affect our lives.  And I can't even talk with my conservative friends or family about issues - they will not even debate. I think this is the issue main issue now of our time.   Some of these right-wing idiots will do anything to screw us.  This was an article I saved last year regarding a guy from Chicago: http://truth-out.org/opinion/item/17917-bombshell-plutocrats-brazenly-collude-to-hurt-state-economies-and-screw-working-people   I think you did a great job!    So many people here are cynical.  I would have cried too.   No other president cared as much for the working man either.   I know people living then who thought he was a God.   Remember the song with the lyrics "joy to the fishes in the deep blue sea".  Fishes?  Really?      Where is it?   I can relate.   Makes me dizzy.    Thank you.  Great post.         I'm impressed.   Heis a good guy.   They tried to cut food stamps, medicare, and stop the affordable care act, but those darn democrats got in the way.   I'm curious what school she graduated from, like Michelle Bachman.   Good post.   He doesn't say crazy things like Ann Coulter.  I hate to see this false equivalency.   I thought this was a great article. I'm very interested in how we can bridge this divide and solve some of the problems that may cause our ultimate demise if ignored.   I listened to SCOTUS arguments on C-SPAN on another case and heard Scalia make an argument straight from Fox news that was totally inaccurate (the health care law). I could not believe what I was hearing! At least be factual!   You have Reagan saying that Government is the problem, and then it became one.      I worked as a job developer in the 80's in a low-income community.  I would ask clients to choose 1) more income or 2) closer proximitiy.  Most clients would ask for proximity because it was so difficult to get to jobs even with a bus service.  I see it still today.   She ought to get 100% subsidy.     I wouldn't want to wash it off -ever!    Very nice.   It was as fun as it looked.   Hmmmm.   No, I'm not bitching about the bailout.  I just would like another one for Detroit.   You're right.  I posted to the wrong comment!  Duh.   96% of Romney's vote was white, so I guess that leaves 4% of everyone else.   If you believe in fiscal sanity, vote Democratic!  All you have to to is look at spending under Reagan, Clinton, Bush and Obama, then tell me who is fiscally more sound.   I'll repeat myself.  Don't rewrite history.  All those Democrats became Republicans after the Civil Rights Act passed under Johnson.     Don't rewrite history.  Once the Civil Rights Act was passed, all the Dixiecrats became Republicans.   I wish all the people without medicaid would register and vote for democrats.  That would get some attention.   While my guitar gently weeps.  	143
 No idea sorry, can you try Shazam-ing it?   Listen to Title Fight's album Hyperview. It's alternative rock but it's almost minimalist. I would suggest it if you enjoy listening to music as an aural experience since they play around a lot with the acoustics of the thing and make it sound very ambient for an alternative record, which is interesting to say the least. It's as if the sound kind of surrounds you from all sides as opposed to just going in your ears laterally, if that makes sense. It's also a very cohesive album so if you hear it in one sitting you'll enjoy it even more. Or if you can wait until July then listen to Tame Impala's new album it's called Currents. Or if you can't wait listen to some of the songs on it that are already out. They're a wonderful mix of, well, you can't really pin Tame Impala into a genre they're just great. They're basically every 60's and 70's band you ever loved reimagined and reconstructed.   Alice Cooper - Is It My Body, The Rolling Stones - Shake Your Hips    My Bloody Valentine has not necessarily gotten better with age, but when you have a phenomenal record like Loveless coming out in 1991 and then 22 years later being able to put out M B V in 2013 with similar results really says something. It's really hard to top Loveless but M B V definitely makes me want to pull my hair out trying to choose between the two so that says something.   Absolutely. Ringo Deathstarr is doing shoegaze quite brilliantly.   There's a French band called La Femme with a debut album called Psycho Tropical Berlin. Beware though they're pretty niche but great.   I' don't know what kind of music you like or tend to listen to normally but think 80's post-punk/new wave. Bands like Blondie, Devo, Dexy's Midnight Runners, Dire Straits, that stuff.   Honestly you can't hate on Ariana Grade for her song Love Me Harder. It is a great pop song, especially the production. But while you're on The Zombies, Time of the Season is amazing. The Beatles' I'm Only Sleeping is great. Honestly my definition of pop is pretty fluid it kind of merges into indie if you're going into the 21st century, in which case I would recommend The Virgins' debut album.  	8

 You could try /r/HeavySeas. For ships, there's /r/WarshipPorn   This was taken approx 210 NM off of the coast of Alaska in the Bearing Sea during one of the summer storms.      How closely does NOAA and NMFS work with the US Coast Guard with regards to releasing rehabilitated turtles and anything else that might threaten turtles?   AutoMod has been revamped and should be able to do this.   Yep!   Not to be confused with the rotten Desert Bluffs!   [](/suspicioustwi) Are you one of the trees in that forest?   TREES, THEY ARE US   Imagine that :P   Most of his stuff is royalty free, but I know of a song being posted to here later today that if you wish to use it for commercial purposes, it's like $5 to purchase the song.   After that tour, I spent the rest of my career trying to get back underway   Yep!   I shall look into that!  Thank you :)   Where would you recommend someone ,who has had their love of space rekindled, start to learn more about space and the amazing wonders that are waiting out there?      I am both mesmerized and terrified at the same time   Here's the best way to determine if you're an AB.  Do you identify as an AB?  Survey says:  I consider me not being an AB just a DL.  I think if anything you're a DL who's interested in the AB side of things. But that's just my two cents.    I always hated wearing Trops (Tropical Blue Long) and standing at Attention/Parade Rest like a damned ornament. Especially when we would pull in.   I don't think the bear would do so well inside of the vibe :P   I am strangely turned on by it but still find it a bit odd to be honest. Is it for both male and female?   I appreciate the thought! Mostly, I like to post pics from the Coast Guard :)   I've been hanging out on /r/schweiz and /r/WarshipPorn lately.    Mostly the ones in the sidebar. /r/abdlstories, /r/DudesInDiapers, /r/GirlsInDiapers, sometimes, /r/babyfurs and /r/littlespace.   It does work I will give it that. But it's also becoming a place where I don't really want to waste an hour of my life as things get all backstaby.   While difficult at first, it does get easier and you'll find you start to relate with bits and pieces. You'll never truly identify with one person as everyone's experiences are slightly different, but you'll start to see themes that are present in your own life.    They are helpful! Stay strong and remember, one day at a time.   Hi. My name is /u/test_subject1730 and I'm an alcoholic. I've been in Alcoholic Anonymous  for damn near 3 years now. The program is helpful but still full of shit at the same time. I've never been in a bigger real life circlejerk before, but it has helped me stay sober. Everyday I struggle with not drinking and I know that there are people I can call if it gets bad that have been there and can talk me down from the ledge, as it were. People talk about addiction to numerous drugs, but a lot of people forget the powerful effects that alcohol has and that it too is just as powerful of a demon as many illicit substances.    The map really helps a lot! It was amusing to see the collective blinding of /r/WarshipPorn with the first graphic. Fantastic work though!   It's fantastic to see you post this here! :D  Amazing work as always!   [Navsource page](http://www.navsource.org/archives/12/1601.htm)  	31
 Not only that, this is self-reported and relies on memory of something that happened 10, 20 or more years ago.  Can we say "meaningless?"   What if I say:  "If you elect me sheriff, I promise to end all speed traps." How do you think that would go over, and how do you think drivers would respond?   Wait, wut? Platonic spooning is a thing?   If you knew how an election primary works then you'll understand why Congress doesn't give a fuck what "most Americans" want. They only care about the special interests that can mobilize enough votes (and it really doesn't take many votes or much effort) to defeat them in a primary.   I just don't think they were gullible. Sure, there are a few idiots in Congress but the vast majority are not dumb. They are very good at calculating but this was one time where their calculations were wrong. I believe many of them cast a Yes vote to authorize military force, not because they actually believed Iraq was any kind of imminent threat, but because they felt it was going to be a cakewalk and they didn't want to be on the wrong side of that vote. I count Hilary Clinton among that group. Indeed the invasion *was* a cakewalk. They just didn't count on the major fuckupery that happened under Paul Bremer, Douglas Feith, Paul Wolfowitz, Donald Rumsfeld and Dick Cheney (dismantling the Iraq Army, disenfranchising Baathists, insufficient security manpower--none of that is the fault of Congress).  Again, that's not leadership. A leader would do what they really believed was right, not what they calculated to be politically expedient. I don't see any indication whatsoever that she is any different now than she was then. With her in the White House, it would still be more about political expediency than philosophical, moral and ethical structure.  I may still vote for her, but I'll be holding my nose while doing it.   I disagree. Scott Ritter, who was an UNSCOM weapons inspector in Iraq, was travelling throughout the country and all over the news prior to the Iraq invasion telling people that Iraq had no WMDs and no capability to make them. Congress knew (or should have known) that none of the 9/11 hijackers had any relationship to Iraq. The yellowcake story and subsequent attempts to link Iraq to 9/11 by the administration had already been discredited (look up Joseph Wilson and Valerie Plame).  If somebody voted in favor of authorizing military force against Iraq in spite of all of this, then it's clear evidence of a failure of leadership.   I also don't see much difference between my local Walmart and Whole Foods fruits and vegetables except the price. Whole Foods has better prepared foods, breads and bulk foods section (grains, nuts, dried fruits, etc).   God was probably proud of his son's accomplishments, especially when he treated lepers, the blind, the sick and the poor, all for free.   85% vs. 95% = 15% vs 5%. I think that's awful but maybe it's a glass half empty or full kind of thing. The glaring point about your comment is this:  Of the 85% who are insured the vast majority is employer-tied. Why the hell is it the responsibility of the employer to buy/subsidize health insurance for their employees? That's fucked up. If you were to design a health insurance system, no mentally stable person would ever say this was a good thing to do.   Lost in all of your approving comments is the sad fact that something like this has to be done in America. No other handicapped citizen in any other first world country has to worry about health care.   You break, you buy. Ask Murica.   Of course. Any middle eastern studies professor could have told you that, and many tried to tell Bush, Cheney and Rumsfeld.  ISIS is directly descended from the Iraq war.   Netanyahu wants to *increase* sanctions. Because that worked so well with North Korea?  Netanyahu's proposals would lead directly to military action. The purpose of diplomatic talks is, to put it bluntly, to get a diplomatic solution. The 7-Nation talks produced a solution that pushes the nuclear armament horizon from 2 months to 12 months, and includes constant monitoring and complete access.   The goal of the diplomatic solution is to avoid the military warfare which actually *does* threaten Israel's survival.   Even though steak is great, it's OK to just want a hot dog every now and then.   We are mere mortals before a God.         Most of the atmospheric science community believes that it's already too late.   Whenever an innocent person is freed, the cops, prosecutors, judge and jurors should be named and pictures of them made public.   First, it really is a great map. Many commenters say that they wish they could do this.   No you don't.  A perfectly working human brain forgets things. This is by design. The human brain is really good at separating the wheat from the chaff, identifying and paying attention to what is important to survival and reproduction. When your brain treats every bit of information the same and remembers it all, it's a curse not a blessing.   That's great!      Good guy, that Kubrick.   We are doomed as a species because we have turned evolution upside down. The most unsuccessful individuals are breeding at a much higher rate than successful individuals.   I'm asian, and I always find the "honor" and "heroism" argument of Japanese suicidal fighting to be specious. It's not heroism. It's actually a different form of cowardice. It's the inability to stand up to a culture that is threatening public shame and humiliation to your family if you don't die for your leader.   So did you think was he the breaking   entering type before all this?   When I started my business I signed a lease agreement for an office, and agreements for phone lines and internet. All of those agreements have early termination penalty clauses, as will the renewals. I was a dumbass.         I haven't clicked either. I'm just not man enough for that shit.   It has happened to me. A piece of firewood fell out of a pickup truck coming towards me on a 2 lane highway, bounced once on the road then hit my car. Smashed the windshield but fortunately it did not go through. My wife was in the car with me. We pulled over, looked at each other, said "Wow, holy shit." Then I turned around and chased down the driver and got their insurance info. The lady said "sorry" but wasn't all that upset about it.   Think about what you're selling. People buy solutions to problems.   1. Identify the problem. 2. Come up with a sales pitch that presents you as a solution. 3. There are other solutions out there competing for the same customer. Make your solution the prized one.   Really? Seemed fine with Chrome 41.0.2272.104 on a MBP Core 2 Duo running Yosemite.   You will probably never get her approval because for her it's about exercising power and control. Her threat to embarrass you is an obvious clue that she is not rational. It's a war and she will threaten any nuclear option she has. Remember, she has had 22 years to learn your emotional weaknesses and she will exploit them.  Your choice is this:  Give in and reinforce her belief that she can control you through emotional torture, or withstand the onslaught, get battered, and emerge from this with her realizing that she no longer has that kind of power over you. That path will be very difficult but I believe you'll thank yourself in a year.   Sun. Lots of sun. Water twice a day. Don't pack the soil.   Beef is so cheap in the U.S. that pho ga is always just an afterthought. Sometimes I want something different but I have yet to be satisfied with any pho ga here.   I generally agree except that I think the Pho Ga is better in Vietnam.   You mean *hyperbolical*. Hyperbolic means to follow the curve of a hyperbola. A common mistake.   Oh, WITHOUT A DOUBT. I think by the end he realized it too. That's why he and Cheney barely acknowledge each other now. He knows Dick fucked Bush.   I'm sure there are things about him that you wish were better. Maybe better abs, pecs, ass, hair, a bigger dick.  A relationship goes through these stages. At first, you are completely blind and see nothing but perfection. Then you see an imperfection, then a few more. Couples that make it through this stage find ways to accept their partner's imperfections and that is exactly what defines a successful LTR. It's not easy to do but that's also why most relationships fall apart.   I think it's healthy to get these things in the open but talk about the fact that nobody will be a perfect fit to their partner's ideal but as adults, can you find acceptance with each other's perceived shortcomings.   Sure, OKC is used widely and without much incident. The fear is, of course, irrational but it exists. I read the study a couple of weeks ago, probably on reddit. I'll look for it....   Recent study came out that most women on OKC fear that their first date will end up with them as different body parts in a dumpster. So I think this is a reason why a lot of women prefer FWBs over one night stands.   Dear India,  Stop trying to scam me with fake virus cleanups and I'll think about helping you.  Sincerely, Murica.   Regardless of advisors, the President still makes the final decision.    Interestingly, some quite rational people believe that there is a segment of religious conservatives--mostly Baptists--who *want* war in the middle east because it will bring on the second coming of Christ. They will support any military endeavor in that region.   Vietnam here. Don't know what that is but it's not pho. With pho, the broth is added to a bowl of dry ingredients. It is never cooked in a pot. Certainly we don't add chopped scallions and bean sprouts to the cooking pot.  I'm not sure it's Vietnam (not a single cone hat to be found in the photo). *If* this is even Vietnam, it may be a soup like *canh chua* which is a sour soup.   This is the best response and should be upvoted more.   In America, the Republican party tries to have you believe that Brits hate the NHS and want it to be more like the American system.   It's probably about half the water. Using the traditional method I would use about 4-6 cups of water (1-1.5 L if you're not Murcan) for a single serving of 3 oz pasta. It gets to boiling really fast, a few minutes. This dish was 15 minutes to fork-ready.    Faster, less energy, less water.    New to /r/soccer, are ya?   What, you haven't seen his previous internationals?   Maybe at the MLS level but his last couple of internationals were very shaky.   Hahaha, is your petty little ego so fragile that a few up votes makes your day? How incredibly pathetic. "Good design is timeless?" Holy shit, are you in high school? Here's a secret that you'll learn when you actually get out in the real world:  You don't know if your design is "good" or "timeless." Nothing that is timeless was ever designed with that in mind because history judges that, dumbass.   Here's the thing: You did not discuss Bebas Neue. You never even attempted to do so. You belched meaningless tripe in a sophomoric effort to be an anti-populist "cool kid." A reference to Emojis? Are you fucking serious? Guess what? Emojis have been around longer than you, my precious little budding teenage artist, and they will outlive any crap you manage to dump on humanity. Maybe that means they're "timeless" and therefore "good design."  If you can't tell the fucking difference between Bebas Neue and Helvetica, you have a long fucking way to go before your opinion is worth the toilet paper you use to wipe it off your ass. Go study like a good little student and maybe someday somebody will give a shit.   Ah, thanks for the info. The law was a Republican law (sponsored by Charles Grassley) that was meant to force Democrats into using the ACA exchange. Can we chalk this up to "unintended consequences?"      Actually, the problem is with you. I asked a question to get people's opinions. If you didn't have an opinion, just stfu. Instead, you assumed that I wouldn't use a font if I believed it was overexposed. You would be wrong. Assumptions make asses, and you proved the adage again.  You should care because you should know design styles and trends. This happens all over the creative world, whether it's visual arts, fashion or music. That doesn't mean you should limit yourself to only what is hot at the moment. Absolutely not. But you should keep up with what's going on in the world so you can stay relevant.   Is it the new Lobster? I have the feeling that it has passed its peak of usefulness.   Try fried shallots. You can get them from an asian grocery store for a few bucks a bagful, the equivalent of probably a few dozen shallots. I sprinkle them on salads and soups, add them to burgers (my secret burger ingredient).   I agree. I think red onion is still too sharp. Vidalias in salad is my preference.   Debone and skin them, marinate in olive oil, garlic, oregano, salt and pepper for 30 minutes. Skewer, grill, squeeze some lemon over it and enjoy with Beaujolais.   I first learned of the cold pan method of cooking pasta from Chow.com ([link](http://www.chow.com/videos/show/chow-tips/94799/how-to-quickly-cook-pasta-in-a-frying-pan)). My first time making it, I was worried that the small amount of water would cause the pasta to stick together so I chose whole wheat pasta because it has less starch. That pasta didn't stick so tonight I tried it again, this time with regular pasta. For the recipe I decided to keep it simple--butter, sea salt and parmigiana--and to reuse leftover supermarket rotisserie chicken from last night's dinner.  I measured out 3 oz. pasta, put it in my 8" skillet and added enough water to cover plus extra to account for absorption and vapor loss, around 2 cups, maybe a little more. I put the cold pan on the flame and it got to boiling within a couple of minutes. This time I started a timer when I reached boiling. Here's a [photo](http://i.imgur.com/ytqwcyV.jpg) of the pasta in the pan. While the pasta was cooking I shredded the chicken and minced some basil.  The box called for 10 minute al-dente. I tasted the pasta at about 8.5 minutes and it was almost there. I took it off the heat, drained and reserved the pasta water and added the butter and chicken ([photo](http://i.imgur.com/vOijXXf.jpg)).  I tossed everything together. The residual heat of the pan was enough to melt the butter and warm the cold chicken. I added back a little pasta water to keep everything moist. I seasoned with sea salt, black pepper, and added shredded parmigiana and the basil.  Here's a [photo](http://i.imgur.com/ayPjFlJ.jpg) of the finished dish. Elapsed time, about 15 minutes. It was delicious!  Notes:  * Part way through cooking there was no longer enough water to fully cover the pasta. I just stirred the pasta a couple of times a minute and I really didn't notice any effects from that. Next time I'll start with a little more water.  * Despite the very small amount of water used, the pasta did not stick together.     This is kind of related. One of my rules is to try to find somebody who impresses me in some way. I've dated both--women who do and women who don't impress me--and it's a lot more fun with the ones who do. I accept it and embrace it as a part of my relationship and I make sure I let them know when they do or say something that is truly awesome.      That's not difficult to conceptualize because the milk is (presumably) sitting in the refrigerator while the tea is cooling.  What happens when you take the milk out at the beginning of the experiment and leave it out so that it is warming up while the tea is cooling down?   No, it just means American voters are dumbasses, but we already knew that.   There's usually a reason nobody goes to a kids birthday party. Probably because nobody likes the ki or the parents.       Risk and Uno are good 3-person games that are good for a wide variety of ages. Scrabble is good for 2 or 3 persons as long as they are of similar abilities.    Because stupid people upvote. You can't avoid stupid people, unfortunately.   [Tsutomu Yamaguchi](http://abcnews.go.com/WN/atomic-bomb-victim-survived-hiroshima-nagasaki-dies-japan/story?id=9489697) was near ground zero of both the Hiroshima and Nagasaki atomic bomb attacks. He also died of stomach cancer. At age 93.   I had somebody today ask if I could come out and tone out a line to install a phone. I told them $60. They said they could buy a line toner cheaper than that.   You can't deal with people like this who think your labor is worthless.   Sexuality is a spectrum. There are complete heterosexuals, complete homosexuals and a whole bunch of people who fall somewhere in between.   *Crickets*   Only a couple of things, stir fry and steaks.   Why hasn't doner kebab caught on in the U.S.? Why?   Great ideas. I can see how you can do stock and cream based sauces pretty easily right in the pan.    Is it possible to make your own sugar free syrups, using Splenda for example?   Others have given great advice and recipes. I'll just tell you my story. The first dish I attempted for my wife as a noob cook was blackened salmon out of a recipe book given to us as a wedding present. Disastrous, as in smoke-alarms-going-off disastrous. She still loved me and appreciated it. Fortunately, I got better.   I start with oil in a cold pan and pre-heat it gently (medium). This evens out the heat and minimizes hot spots. I then turn it up to cooking temperature and add my ingredients when the oil starts to shimmy.   I agree with this. Stainless is never 100% non-stick and that's not a bad thing. You need both types of pans because there are are times when you want it to stick. When you are cooking meats and are creating a fond for a sauce or extra flavor, use stainless. If you are cooking something delicate like fish or eggs, use non-stick.   Honestly, I didn't time it since I knew I was going to be unsure with this method. I just went by feel. After I started cooking with the sauce I just checked it with a bite every minute. The whole process was really fast, 15 minutes or so to being fork-ready. This is just a guess but if you were to start a timer when the water started boiling, you wouldn't be too far off.   I sure did!    I second the shrimp stock, or even chicken stock. In Thai and Vietnamese cooking we strive for the 4 flavors:  Sweet, salty, spicy and brightness (acid). Add a little sugar, start with 1 tsp. You just want only a hint of sweetness. It is a good counterpoint to saltiness and spiciness.  	84

                   bad idea - no respect for your readers! Who wanted your changes? A lots of folks wanted pure tech - RESTORE IT!!!!   Look really poor in this days.  Cheaper and better option arudino clon form China - 2.80 and much more fan.   Whole idea behind homeopathy sounds really stupid but my experience and my wife's telling that it could help. And I believe more my experience then  top Aussie Uni research centers. I can take stuff from jungle medicine men but only one condition - got to work properly - doesn't matter reason or theory or ideology.  One big advantage, it is so diluted that couldn't poison you - many thing from chemist shop really can.   Don't be such  puristic - this is about all old world business    Send your MEP email what you thinking about it!!                           If you will waiting for last minute to cancel your subscription you'll be definitely charged for the first month. I enrolled and when I tried to cancel udacity several times (!!!) ask me to change my password to make sure it's really me - and all this time curse was on the list. So, if you want to cancel make sure you have half an hour to end of the trial.  I know , my first post was too dramatic   ;))    - just to make some attention for the problem - you know: in murky water easier to catch a fish  and  sorry for my English - it's not my first language      This is what I thought. But I couldn't find the link to view that stuff only enroll button where you must give bank account details and if you forget cancel enrollment before 1 week trial is done they will charge you for 1 month - $200.  Any one know a way to view nanodegree without giving bank details?    Udacity nanodegree - is it next way to pull money from people who forgot to cancel after they enrolled  and give bank card details? Or is any way to access nano-course materials without banks details?  Isn't rip off to charge folks $200/month for MOOC? Estimated cost of one MOOC is 100k - 200k $. If will be 100k (as usually) and every one only forgot to cancel that will be profit circa 200M $ !!!??? That's better business than Apple, Google and Microsoft together.   I hope you right, I just looking for clear statement from MS.   question is: if I update, one year will be free, next year maybe and what later? Will be possibly to switch back to win7 and don't pay for license???!!!  	25
 What midfielder for less than $7.9 million is good for this week and maybe a couple of weeks ahead?   Tolls on all highways and major roads around Detroit. (People don't leave the city. If people wanted to avoid tolls, they go on other roads = more congestion = more business development). Cut Taxes on houses, businesses, and industry, which will attract people from outside the city. Add more police patrols to reduce crime. Build from the inner core and expand outwards. Build Public Transit Infrastructure, once there is density. Education, healthcare, parks, social services, etc later on.    The top card is the bottom card...   ^   Modern because we decided that we should send our factories over there and China decided to explore capitalism. Double Edge Sword? We want to "help developing countries", but doing so might hurt us. Then, we complain that we aren't growing as fast as them even though China has more people and it should be expected that they will have the largest GDP in the world. The real surprise is how the USA maintained its economic power for so long.    I agree. Over-specialization can bad. Look what happened to Detroit, when automation and outsourcing happened. If any major war. financial crisis, or whatever happens between the US and other countries, we wouldn't have the facilities to produce our own goods. We would be hit with a recession first, if that happens, since other countries would block imports to us. Prices will rise for all of us. In reality, nobody knows what the true cost of goods are, since there are so many external factors.  It is interesting though. Could the USA should export more goods than imports in goods to pay down our trillions of dollars of debt?  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twin_deficits_hypothesis  "The twin deficits hypothesis, also called the double deficit hypothesis or twin deficits anomaly, is a macroeconomic proposition that there is a strong link between a national economy's current account balance and its government budget balance.[1]"   How so?   Economists say:   Think about the comparative advantage of producing in "developing" countries! (This is a better term than "Third World", since this isn't a Cold War setting).   We get cheap goods. Living Standards increase for developing countries. We specialize in something else rather than manufacturing. :)   It is giant space where there are lots of railroad tracks, truck/storage facilities, and lots of parking area near south Boston and the South End.   Yep. it is also interesting how they defend secret negotiations so that the USA will "gain from trade", so they can get the. "Best deal possible" even though it contradicts the idea that trade lifts all boats and there supposedly no overall "losers" in the macro sense in trade.   A mixture of sarcasm and presenting the economics of freetrade    Economists say that freetrade is always good. it is only bad news for a few people. Consumers, exporters, living standards for developing countries all gain from TPP. :)   No! Nearly all Academic scholars and economists say that freetrade is always good. :)   The Boston 2024 Main Olympic Stadium is a great location.   They have been known for weeks. I just wanted to know other potential relatively cheap defenders.   if TPP was the most "progressive" trade deal to ever be made to reduce the effects of outsourcing, environmental concerns, labor rights, human rights, poor quality control, etc, How does the Republican Party stand to gain from this trade deal? Do you really think that they will agree to a progressive trade deal?   TRADE! Are you against trade? Why dislike access to foreign goods and globalization? Say goodbye to cheap prices! Save manufacturing? modern Luddites? Protectionism? Bad economics much?   Doesn't economics have to do with government policy? Even the minimum wage topic causes headaches among experienced economists lol   It is secret because we need to make sure that US gains from trade and don't lose even though freetrade benefits everyone.   people should support TPP because freetrade is good. Most economists say so. Protectionism is bad. Living standards have increased across the world. Wouldn't you believe so from globalization? products are cheaper. Horray! Specialization for all countries. USA should outsource most of its manufacturing and shift to high tech!. trade deficits don't matter. Because consumers gains + our money is reinvested in capital will come back to the USA.    Toia isn't really a good pick because he has shown to get 1 point for games. If you have money, I recommend Polster.    Just agree with the trade bill because most to all economists say that trade = good :)   I just want to know some potential cheap defenders, who may or may not be semi-starters. It looks like they won't be, so.... I'll just keep my eye on them for the future :)   Dia is worth $4.5 million and in the last three games..... started for 90 minutes in each with clean sheets in all three.   Marquez is worth $4.7 million and in the last 4 games... started for all 90 minutes and has two clean sheets.     I had Deric, but I switched him out for Bush since he has fallen from his original 5.0 value. I could replace Ousted with Deric to save some money. Just need to hope Deric and Houston's defense will be better in the upcoming weeks. :\      Which midfielder is better to get in round 15 and expect to be better/play more over the next 3 or 4 rounds? Kaka, Dempsey, Castillo, Nguyen? - all over $10.0 million   YES!!   Also governments can fiscally alter prices and costs of goods with subsidizes and regulations, so nothing is really free in trade. All Governments engage in some sort of protectionism.   The Republican Party used to be pro high tariffs to support US manufacturing. Democrats wanted low tariffs to export agriculture goods.   It is obvious since big businesses are the truly the only ones who can fully outsource production and gain profits. Can a small business decide that it wants to relocate? Is a consumer in a foreign country going to compare products between a small business and a big business American company? How many foreign companies are on par with Western big businesses in terms of size? Can migrants move to countries to strive for higher wages as easily as businesses can strive for lower costs? Should immigration be open doors for all countries to eliminate protectionism?   Mhm. Budget Deficits also don't matter. ;)   You would need major investments in High-Speed Rail, which is going cost upwards of 100+billion dollars to 1 trillion dollars intially.    Why should the Northeast fund small town airports in the middle of nowhere? Fund it yourselves!   Boo! Somebody in those states should campaign on increasing Amtrak spending in the next election.   Trade Deficits don't matter at all! ;)   Freetrade is good. We get cheaper products, more competition, more consumers of our goods, increased specialization (our economy = high tech), help developing countries, etc. economics 101  We should outsource our entire manufacturing overseas! Also trade deficits don't matter! Google it and you see articles saying that trade deficits don't matter. :)   Also watch Decoyroid, but it isn't really that great, since it doesn't lock with two decoyroids.    Dimension of Chaos has been rumored to have old roid support, but rumors are usually false.... :\   {Cyber Summon Blaster} ? Special summoning of machine type roid monsters :)   Patroid is nearly useless because it has super low attack with the ability just to look at a set card in spell/trap zone.   I would keep an eye out on {{Jetroid}}   I say go with Arrieta because Espindola is injury prone and isn't good to have an inconsistent player.   Nearly all pro and relegation leagues favor a few good teams at the top because they have more money than the rest and players will inherently want to join them because they are "successful".   Bad idea   Yugo and Yuya probably have to merge after Yuya duels Jack.   Yugo and Yuzu are probably in the slums or in the city hiding.   Royal Magical Library will be limited or banned.    Some prices will rise because nobody knows the competitive effects of cros in the tcg game.   no since Nekroz will probably get hit in the next format. Stick with crossed souls.   D/D/D and Speedroids   It is already made.....   Syrus Truesdale Starter Deck? lol   TOP 350! :D   it will probably be blackwings since it is a fan favorite.   No because we are a republic. We shouldn't have 100+ amendments on a trade agreement or else the trade deal is too complicated.    because China makes our goods. If we shut them off, we would be in a recession with skyrocketing prices of goods..   Economists say move to a different job. :)   If you are in Canada, then the setting should be pretty LGBT friendly. Of course, you always try to go to a locals with a more urban setting, since those settings tend to be more socially liberal than more rural settings. I mean.... you wouldn't want to go to a locals in rural Alberta, right? lol   I am not a member of the LGBT group, but it really depends on what your locals location is....  Also, I doubt people will notice, if you are "passable". Just make sure to keep the LGBT issue at a minimum.  Are you in a conservative or liberal state? Are you in a rural, small town, suburban, or urban setting?   Trade Deficits don't matter! :)   True. Also Trade Deficits don't matter because as long as we keep importing cheap goods more than we export in goods, we gain the benefits of a globalized trade. :D   The left should agree with TPP because it is a freetrade agreement which is good for everyone and helps developing countries. Nearly all economists say Trade is good.   The inability to get stuff done in a very gerrymandered, polarized, changing America.    No. If the GOP manages to nominate a moderate nominee in the general election, the GOP could win swing states as the rightwing groups will come out in force to vote. All of Obama's coalition of voters won't necessarily vote for Sanders.    Nope. Walmart is still in business as well as many others. :)   Nobody is listening because trade is always good. End all tariffs. we should outsource most of our manufacturing overseas because it will cost less, give us cheaper products, increase competition, and help developing countries reduce poverty. Trade Deficits don't matter. :)    Link to your post? :)   By the way, interesting subreddit...   Sure.   But freetrade helps developing countries and we get cheap products! ;)   True. Both parties had conservative, liberal, and moderate wings.    He also spent a lot of time on vacations and has been known to treat his fellow adminstration officials with authoritarian tone.    How about Nelson Rockefeller, who was booed during the 1964 GOP National Convention for denouncing "extremism" and for being too "liberal" and "moderate"?    He is the probably the best candidate within the GOP, who will get some Democratic Hispanic voters.    Then limit fiendish chains...   Throw in John Kasich who appeals to moderates and socially conservative liberals.   Jim Webb is a democrat...   I recommend 3 thunder dragons and 1 hand destruction.   Why? Just vote on one day or 1 week before for absentee voting, so campaigning is fair.    It doesn't make sense, since the GOP controls the House and the Senate. Also, do you really think the GOP has a comprehensive plan after cutting Amtrak spending and had many years to propose a long term plan for transportation?   then they complain that gas price increases are the fault of the president and when gas prices fall, then it isn't the president's policies.    tolls do divert traffic to roads without traffic which can be good for businesses in areas with low traffic congestion.   George Pataki - He is semi reasonable with some liberal views on economic policy and environmental policy but does have some neoconservative views with military, NSA, and Marijuana.  Rand Paul - Libertarian who has some views that are close to social liberalism but most of his economic policy is at odds with many progressives   Marco Rubio - He is a candidate who appeals to Hispanics with general conservative views with a sprinkle of liberal view.    He should get a trial, but he should be able to come back without spending most of his life in jail or receiving harm because he did expose some stuff that infringes on people's liberties, while did break some rules.    But... Well... Who wants to pay $4 per a gallon of gas? We need to go back to $1 per a gallon. ;)  We need to make sure that it drops to as low as possible.    Abolish the Gas Tax! ;)          Possible. Heavy Storm is another good option. Pendulums get sent to extra deck on both sides.   Giant Trunade might be better since konami doesn't want Raigeki and Harpies feather duster in the same formate for OTKs.    Giant Trunade is better since Pendulums can reset their scales and can change up scales, if they want.    Penguin soldier tier 1   Let them drill an make them complain about the health and environmental problems.   Who are you?      I know, but he might play 1 game like how Ishizaki might play one game.    Opare might not play 2 games for full 180 minutes.   Keep Kamara on Captain? :\   I have Platti as a captain right now for the randomness, but I am probably going to choose Kamara, since Montreal and Philly's defenses aren't great.       Thanks for the comic!   Free-Trade is always good for America says most intelligent economists. Even if 5 chapters is  about trade, Lower Prices for Consumer means that overall welfare has increased. Trade is done in a comparative advantage way, which will boost more GDP. Do people really want tariffs everywhere?  Outsourcing and Automation is good for society, so we can focus on other industries.    Watch Nelson Rockefeller's speech to the GOP National Convention in 1964. Then, you compare it to Barry Goldwater's speech. You will see how the GOP has changed.   Watch Nelson Rockefeller's 1964 speech to the GOP national government. You will see how the GOP has changed.   Southern democrats and southern republicans voted against it.   Yes, but do the new kind of jobs replace the original aggregate demand done from worker wages?    Wages is demand. Machines don't buy stuff. machines also depend entirely on electricity and energy.   	108
    Nice spin, but as usual factually inaccurate (suggesting that *this* is what sets precedent for EPA to do cost-benefit, lol!)  I'll keep it nice and simple:  EPA was planning on taking costs into account at the next stage of the MATS development. SCOTUS says "Go ahead and do it now."  So this simply rearranges the timeline, doesn't invalidate the MATS and certainly doesn't change anything about CPP.    Did you mean CPP?   Because like I just said, this [kicks out one of the legs of the CPP plaintiff's arguments](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-06-24/obama-may-win-by-losing-in-quirk-of-supreme-court-epa-review), that since coal plants are regulated under MATS they can't be under CPP. So unless you're seeing some  way for a new lawsuit because of the MATS ruling (which would be novel because IIRC the CPP already did the cost accounting that MATS didn't yet ) then I think you're mistaken.  If you did mean MATS, then it's still not accurate since this ruling just kicked the suit back down to the DC court to make the EPA consider costs now instead of later when designing the enforcement. Doesn't throw out the MATS rule, just says the EPA has to take costs into account. DC court may throw out the rule, but since it upheld the rule last time it's not likely to toss it now, but instead will probably just tell the EPA to go count costs, thereby just delaying enforcement.     Re: SCOTUS decision, you're confusing MATS with CPP. MATS ruling has no effect on CPP, except getting rid of one of the CPP critic's arguments (that emissions were already regulated under MATS so they couldn't be under the CPP.)    Haha yeah for some reason I didn't have that one saved...                                          http://www.tos.org/oceanography/archive/28-2_mathis2.pdf                                             My coworker would like to know how you feel about climate change.   And more importantly, if you're single?    Revenge is a dish best served cold. And moldy and decomposed past the point of all recognition because it's become fertilizer for a pretty flower and then you smell it and then OH NO THE SLOWVENGE IS UPON YOU!          It's all about Catholic's support, or lack thereof, of policy action on climate. That's policy!   Then it talks about the reason-their dedication to free market policies!   Then it ends with the GOP candidate reactions- politics!   Gotta say, this is definitely on-topic.   No, that's why everyone else rejects him.    Aww you shoulda left it it was funny!   But the article is explaining why, in this case, the Catholics are breaking with tradition and thinking he's full of shit. But by and large they don't, because then they wouldn't really be Catholics.    Maybe that's why you and others are rejecting it, but that doesn't make any sense as to why Catholics are. Because Catholics, basically by definition, don't think the Pope's full of shit or that secularism will "whipe" out religion.   (Seriously, whipe? Who're you, Stewie Griffin??)          And the choice couldn't be easier.   Obviously Mammon. I mean, what'd God ever do for 'em?

A Harvard researcher who studied Obamacare is doing an AMA today: https://np.reddit.com/r/science/comments/3b2cdy/science_ama_series_im_ben_sommers_assistant/     There have been a bunch of cases in this vein, this is the first to have a win. So that does set a precedent for other states, but some of those other states have already ruled against it.   Which sets it up for SCOTUS!

Will we let Saudi Arabia corner the solar market?                           http://www.thelancet.com/commissions/climate-change-2015   It's my paraphrasing of paragraphs 4-6:  "Yet, there is a marked lack of publicly available information and analysis which would help New Zealanders decide on the best course of action."  The government had hurried its consultation process on its a negotiating position in the United Nations Paris meeting on climate change in December last year, to a period less than four weeks.  The NZAS was concerned about the lack of publicly available information, as well as the minimal involvement of key New Zealand state-owned research institutes and universities.   No way that 2500+ comment count was accurate. I get every parent level comment in my inbox, and there haven't been that many comments.   Plus only super-popular posts get that many comments, this one was pretty slow to move up.    In this case it's that only the federal-government-dependent research body was given the opportunity to provide input on NZ's position in the UN climate negotiations. Other academic institutions, including state-owned research centers and universities weren't consulted and weren't didn't have access to the data.   So by shutting them out of the process, they were denied the ability to provide their scientific input, i.e. were gagged.    It's both a classic rhetorical tool (accuse someone of your weakness, so that when they then point out that it's your weakness, they look like they're just saying 'no u') and an example of the increasingly common conservative tactic of appropriating the language of the oppressed to create a persecution complex. (Think "War on Christmas" or "Take back our country" or "Men's rights.")    ...why the exclusion of Title+Quote? Seems like if title is allowed, and quote is allowed, then the combination should be allowed. I feel like quotes without the context of a title aren't going to make sense, and submissions with the flashiest quote that may or may not represent the full article (as a title would) are going to proliferate.   Which means that the mods will now have to subjectively decide if a quote is an accurate representation because the title is no longer there to provide an overview of the whole piece.    For a second I read that as "lol Apocalypse" and now all I can think is how "Apocalypse Lol" would make a great name for a documentary about climate denial...            http://www.smh.com.au/environment/un-climate-conference/what-climate-change-will-do-to-your-loaf-of-bread-20150621-ghshcq.html                                                  	141
 Holy shit. This game was my JAM! My father passed away when I was four and one of the things he left behind was a Super Nintendo, this game (and others), and a black book with cheat codes. When I found it at 7 years old, it was like something out of a movie lol.      Don't forget to tag the post as "solved." :)   I used to perform this a lot. My best advice to you if you're worried about this is to either say something when it happens (like "Watch!") or snap with your other hand.   Also worth reminding: don't run when you're not being chased. Enjoy the Raven!   It sounds like it's fastened too high on your outer layer. Position is closer to give yourself more slack.   My daily plight.      Alive With The Glory Of Love- Say Anything   Along with many of their lesser known hits.    If I wasn't poor, I'd give you gold for this.    I didn't fall for it because of nozzle. Would've preferred "neck."   Bill Malone, when teaching Sam the Bellhop, teaches two excellent cuts to the table.   Yes, I saw the first line haha :) The answer is yes... and no. Obviously, if they knew you weren't a student they wouldn't want you there. But it's not like you need an ID to get in there. After my basketball class I walk in there. No lock. Just walk in there and shower. Good luck!   Go into the locker rooms on weekdays by the gym. Showers there.   Thanks for that. I searched before posting. There aren't any good or developed threads yet.   and author. Read The Gunseller.   Update: they couldn't do anything. Here's my take away: know that the store (in this case ATT) cannot just give you a new phone. If it's in warranty, they'll have to send you to a special store that carries refurbished phones and has a center just for troubleshooting. If you're lucky, your store is close by and not 45min away like mine!   Thanks for your reply. I definitely have tried that... all day. :(   Thanks for your reply. Did you go to the ATT store to get that replaced or did you call Nokia?   Thanks for the reply. None at all. Left it "charging" overnight hoping something would happen.   I will say this: I have seen, and even studied, their ads numerous, numerous times. After seeing your post, I finally just became a member. They should pay you.   Thank you sneaky! When you say shoo them, is it appropriate to pick them up and put them near the cardboard? Also, when you say pen them up, am I using that as a punishment when they start digging? Thanks again!   Thanks mate!   Mentally handicapped and severely racist Steve cannot figure out why he can't wash the black off of his car!      I used to work at Disneyland. The family was composed of 2 boys (about 7, 9), a mom, and a dad. I was working on the Jungle Cruise, driving the boat, and telling the jokes.   One of the kids kept pulling down the throttle and another kept grabbing the gun (which, contrary to popular belief, is a real gun that has the capability of shooting real bullets, but we use blanks that can still fuck someone's eardrums or skin up). I repeatedly asked the parents to control their children as to stop fucking around with everyone else's experience. They kind of just said "Stop that" and kept taking pictures.  Finally one of the twerps took it a step further and shot the gun. I stopped the show and drove back to the dock, conferred with my lead before unloading, and had a manager and security meet us to escort the family out of the park. I didn't hear anything else from it.    Good thing the address is on the ke-oh wait.       Watched Freddy Got Fingered.   Post about religion in /r/atheism    They're all too busy posting about PS4.   Anything about not buying things. The answer will always be "Winrar"   So as the title suggests, I used to operate rides in Disneyland. I was there for a couple years and finally quit in February 2013.  I've had much more than my fair share of completely shitty guests. But the most common occurrence is when I'm at the "group" position and we ask how many is in your party so we can divvy y'all into rows and the person says "2" so I put them in row (let's say) 5 and that's the last row in the train so I hold the next group and that person says "OH BUT WE'RE WITH THEM!" (sorry for that monster sentence)  So one night, I was at Big Thunder Mountain and it was nearing the end of my Grad Nite shift (Grad Nite is a night for graduating seniors from all around SoCal to hang out in Disneyland with free reign from 10p-2a). A group of 6 really fat and loud students come up the stairs. The couple behind them scream from behind saying this group cut them. At Disneyland, we can't do anything about that unless we see, but believing them, I bring the couple out of line and reserve a special spot for them. Now, I ask how many the students are. Not listening, I ask again. Finally, one of the people in the back hits the person in the front to acknowledge me. "Haha what?" "How many in your group?" "2" Here we go. Not trying to go through this turmoil and dually seeing an opportunity for some fun, I ask:  "Are you guys 2 or all together here?" "Oh we're all together."  So at Big Thunder, we don't have seats, we have rows that look like benches that are made to hold 2 adults or three children. But we're encouraged to pack the rows to three.   "Rows 6 and 7."  I watch the 6 enter two rows and slowly watch them realize that this is going to be the tightest ride of their lives. Squeeeeeeeeeeeeeezing tight they finally managed to pull the lap bar down one click. We sent the train. When they came back it was like watching a clown car unload.  I gave the other couple who told me all about their problems in line a front row spot.   Maybe...  Wait for it....  **They go there.**   Armed with loaded downvotes.      His name is Toothless Jake!   RIP.      My father passed when I was 4. Now I'm nearly 20, and the only thing that lacks in retrospect was having someone to teach me the things my mom couldn't.   See, when you're a single parent, you have to act as both parents. My mom tried, and for the most part, she succeeded. However, she couldn't teach me things like how to shave, for instance. How to fight, how to pick up girls (in a way), and general guy-to-guy stuff. But I wholeheartedly believe that having a single parent doesn't affect whether you can achieve excellence or not.

 If Cavs fans can complain about that, Warriors fans can complain about this   Warriors were down 3 at that point, and then the subsequent free throws put the Cavs up 5 with about a minute left, to say it didn't at least effect the game is ridiculous    Lol Lebron gets slide tackled like that, Cavs fans go apeshit   Im sorry but that slide tackle by Lebron was bullshit, all that aside we saw curry begin to wake up, but that doesn't mean anything if can't carry into the next game.   Network?   Klay should have taken the last shot   The Warriors are playing 2k basketball, 3's everywhere, all misses   That's what they said about Harden in 2012    So SPEIGHTS......missed dunk......   SPEIGHTS WHY!   Klau losing that potential Finals MVP if this is a loss   Thanks Magic   Curry hasn't even taken a shot yet either, Cavs look like this is the best we'll see of them tonight   Anyone else feel the Warriors are obviously the superior team just from what we've seen so far   Allegedly! 7 semen samples! Where is Ja!    Broken arms   Stay?   Groundhog Day?   Borat?   Amelie   Delly's in, GET CURRY OUT   Lebrons foot was on the line for a three awhile back just sayn   Prediction: Curry gonna attempt the 3 miss, Bogut rebounds, kicks out to Klay misses, rebound bogut, kick to Curry BANG   Now let's go, just give me the signal   I hope I'm not the only one who watches the Game 7 mini movie almost every month to just relive those memories.   North by Northwest         uhhhhhhhh   Man, you've got a face for radio   ONLY 4 HOURS FUUUUUUUUUUUUU   Hot streak, it was crazy and didn't amount to anything :(  	32
    I actually went there to try to find it and was like da fuck?   My bands name was Afghan Banana Stand. We got a picture of the bass player holding our album in one hand and a beer in the other that night. I tried to find the picture but the last time I saw it it was on myspace so yeah...   [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIlwIuN-z2g#t=55s) is the part where the mouse drives the car...   I actually got to open for these guys in Portland Maine about 5 years ago with my old band. We got to hang out with them after the show hand an awesome time. Nice post   I about shit myself when that part come on.   Is it wrong to feel hatred towards these type of people or should I feel sympathy for them? This whole damn world just really saddens me... or at least 90% of it.   A NOFX FAN! Nice to meet you kind sir.   Free ham   Fat Mike makes that joke somewhere on [THIS](http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lqv3qm9In01qfzrl3.jpg) album. Its after one of the songs.   No. Not really.    YES! I was really hoping someone would pick up on that.    They must serve Hitler brand ice cream. It has little tiny nutzies in it.   And they still have a baseball league!   [Reminds me of this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SIaFtAKnqBU)   Dude, I love your sense of humor. In the modern times we live in there is no fucking need to have 19 kids. Nice job!   Classic aunt paddy.   Hes like a tiny hillbilly Mainer I tell you what bub.    As a graduate in new media the shots were very well done as well as the sound and content. Nice job with the rocket take off shots too. Did you use a drone to get those shots?       I was sitting at my desk and heard some drops of rain on my air conditioner a few hours ago and it made me happy. A few hours later I went for a drive by myself and Pink Floyd's song "wish you were here" came on and I smiled. That was a perfect moment and I was happy.    Les is the shit. He doesn't go into this with a bias like other shows. He has the mind set that he has no idea whats out there and just wants the truth. Compared to other shows where they hear a twig break and yell SQUATCH!    This is a good point but I feel like I might get harassed for asking such a touchy subject in a religious sub. Ya know? maybe not.    I understand your reasoning and thank you for your input but wouldn't that mean human nature or nature in general is more powerful? Thats how I interpret it.   Lets say a religious person is in a situation where they are close to death but still have a chance. Why does the will to live usually win the battle when the other option is heaven or what pertains to that individual. To me this means that within even the most hardcore religious person there is a fraction of doubt. How would you translate this contradiction? What are other peoples thoughts on this.   bingo   I hear ya man. About their juices tho, he makes some of the best juices Ive tried. The Cirrus is the key lime pie in the chassing clouds series and I like that one a lot but next time your in try the stratus. I liked that one for a long time but moved on. Right now im vaping crunch berry he made. Its not out to buy yet but if you ask theyll make it for you. What you usally do for juice?    Yea thats the one I go too. What did you think I love that place    Thank you! much appreciated man   Yea, do I know you?   Its on there cause its my local shop and represent right? Its just blank wood underneath. As you guys pointed out the sticker is pretty bad looking so when I get some time im going to take it off and do some more wood burning. Any ideas design ideas? im trying to stick with a rustic almost ancient look but im open to any suggestions.     Thanks man! Been watching to much CKY. IM talking like em now!   Ha yea it does. The stain has been rubbed off from so much use, Its been dropped, and Ive also had to fix it a few times. But overall the patina looks cool.   I swear I was!    Im a perfectionist so when I look at the one I already made I see every damn thing thats wrong so I kinda just want to do the same type of mod again. Plus it would be fun to do some more wood burning.   Oh yea, another thing thats good is If anything ever goes wrong I can fix it myself. I know every grain of wood in that sucker haha    You would think that but it dosn't. and When I hold it my hand isnt near it    This is my hand made variable wattage OKR wooden box mod I made myself. It includes a master on/off switch, fire button, potentiometer, blue LED, and a 5/10 thread to mount any RDA.

The wood is hand cut and worked using mahogany and I used guerrilla wood glue to attach the corners. From there I sanded it and stained it.Then did some wood burning  As you can see its a bit haggard from lots of use. It isn't perfect but its something I made and have pride in and something no one else has. This is the first one I've built so the next one I build should be an improvement.

This is called sarcasm. However, I will answer this... JUST BECAUSE your not being rude *as much*. No I do not think this theory is 100% fucking correct. However plausible because we can not see inside a black hole. Maybe someday we will create something that can pass near the event horizon on a rotating weak black hole and I will be proved wrong (probably not). Until that that day shut the fuck up and stop trying to prove yourself on a fucking Reddit comment section.   I do believe. I DO I DO I DOOOOOOOO. -- Also Very scientific.   ...oh wait --- this. SCIENCE!  	46
 Some did   I masturbate with my left hand because it feels better even though Im a righty. Thats kind of the same thing right?   Poop is sacred, talk about it.    I love the way you cant cut with normal scissors.   Yea, wrong bacon.    Not if you dont let it.    /u/preggit   Yea thats true. My reply was really snarky.    Cuz I saw that dick pic you posted and it made me so hard. I just imagined stroking it while my hard cock throbbed under my underwear.  I want to suck you off untill you cum all over my face and then when you do I can bite your dick off and swallow it and feel your hard black cock in my tummy so you will always be a part of me. And then I will stretch out your new hole and stick my dick in it. And I will start fucking you with our bloody lube while you squirm and scream and it will be so hot. And then when I cum I wanna go down on your hole and suck out our bloody cum mixture while it drips down my chin.      And that sucks but you are just unlucky. Statistically there is a correlation between things like smoking and lung cancer,  or wearing sun screen and skin cancer.   Yea yea its "risk factors" but it still reduces your chances and if you dont take statistics personally, there does appear to be some relation.    Be the change you want to see in the world. Start the conversation with people! Next time you are out at a restaurant turn around to the girl at the table behind you and ask them about backsplash.   A goth/emo phase but im fat. So skinny jeans and black shirts on a fat kid.   And screamo and sounding like a fool when I tried to scream.   Cringe bro   Florida      Estimates though.  if I said 5k that is also technically wrong. And 4k is in the range of "give or take"  Also, you replied to yourself, not me. So, you h8 yourself?   Yes   When a small business is starting up they arent profitable for the first year or so. And for the next year they may be just about cutting even. A small increase in costs would hurt.   Where as a large corporation can shift around a few million here and there when shit happens and not bat an eye.    Yea, we need more tax laws         20 bucks give or take, so 20-5k is negative 4.98k, which means they give you 4k.    Me or the other guy?   I was expecting this: http://i.imgur.com/GXqwX7j.png  Or a cosplay: http://m.imgur.com/a/mtKnZ  Or this:  http://i.imgur.com/dzBKyZG.png  NSFW   I agree with this guy.    I wish   Because it is an extension of humans and humans are dicks. But humans are also nice and very sweet and you will find that on reddit as well.   Woah, they will give me 4k to do it?   And large corporations will find ways around it like firing people and cutting other things. The small business cant afford to let go of their one or two employees.    Small family run businesses would get screwed harder than it seems on the surface.    Sounds like a good start   I bet your dad takes bubblebaths though.    Just like feminism and many other "movements."  The edgy 13 year olds are more vocal and annoying and end up becoming the face of the movement because the serious ones arent forcing their opinion on people and trying to do something about what they believe.   The same with religion, many people think a lot of Christians are like the Westboro baptist church but in reality the ones I have met are nice and make a difference in their communities. But WBC gets media attention because they whine the loudest.   And I have met good athiests too. And I have met decent feminists too.   But you are right, it is comical how the image of all these movements is what they tried to fight.    Or you got a lot of bullets and a good vest   People tend to wait for their turn to talk about their opinion than to actually listen to your argument.    Coke with anything strawberry or cherry flavored.    Alot   Sex with a 16 year old when you are 23 in florida.    A couple weeks ago I went to the bank and withdrew the some money. She asked me how I wanted it, meaning denomination. I said "oh cash is fine" misunderstanding or being distracted or whatever. Then she stared at me for a couple seconds until I said "oh, um, 20s"  Her look of "wow this idiot" makes me cringe and die a lil every time I remember, which, the way my mind works, is every 5 minutes.    Cars are already better than humans in test conditions.   The only things that humans excel at is adaptability to new situations.     Are they self driving?   The Hr chick that was handling my last job kept returning my emails as undeliverable because the recipient's mailbix was full, which usually means they dont work there. Except when I emailed other HR people they told me to email her..   Wut   You could have saved them a long time ago, jerk.    F5 F5 F5   867-5309   You dont puke every day? Weirdo.    Nah, 8 is too old   Many of us identify as the nerdier types. This show is based around mocking the nerdy types.  Thats offensive. Also, many of the things in the show are dumbed down or just plain wrong and thats annoying if you actually understand or know about what they are talking about. So while it appeals to the majority of people, the vocal majority of reddit is not exactly its demographic.    Stick to your username.    Also, walking too close to people. Close enough to slam into them if they stop suddenly.    Chewing with your mouth open. I work with a lot of foreigners and it blows my mind how that is ok in oyher parts of the world. It is obnoxious, gross, and annoying.    /r/gasmaskgirls   Mmm   Not from the UK but I have heard about them on reddit, and that's the truth right there!      Depends on the delivery method. Rudy once dared me to snort it and like hell I would turn down a dare. Well, I couldnt see for a day, had a headache for 3 days, and tasted apple juice for the next week.    Nothing.   You will get ugly houses from the outside and they turn out to be nice on the inside, and vice versa.   I met a kid in elementary school that was so sweet and softspoken. He always shared everything and complimented people and was polite to teachers. But when we hung out we would ride our bikes around outside or he would come over to my house. But we never went to his house.   One day someone brought up this and they kept pressuring him to let them in. One kid even followed him home a couple times. It was weird. Anyways, a couple years later after we are friends for a while he let me in his house.   It was gross in there, his mom was a hoarder and had trash everywhere, he had three older sisters and two of them had their own kids living there, his grandma and his dad and apparantly an uncle who just moved out had lived there. It was like 12 people in a small 2 bedroom house. The walls and carpet were dirty and it was all messed up.   But he was always clean, his nails cut and hair in place. The outside looked good and I had no idea that was inside.  His mom had some mental issues and wasnt working and his dad was supporting all of them so they lived so poorly because of that. And I remembered years before when we made a big deal cuz he didnt let us in. I wouldn't let me in either. Kids are cruel.   And im sure the reverse happens where unkept looking houses look ok in the inside. You cant judge a house by its outside and you cant judge people by their houses or their families.    Because you dont hear about it plastered all over the news.    You can be, if you use it right.   Marry them   Talk to them and tell them they exhibit this behavior and that it is annoying. Tell them you are happy for them when they win and would like for them to be happy for you every now and then too. And if that doesnt work than they might be a bit immature and you have to start xonsidering if you want to be with that type of person or if everything else that they bring outweighs one small, or not so small, flaw.    Just come out the closet man. Theres a support system for you.    I used to think that beer was urine and that grown men ran around drinking urine.    Is that the one with that hagrid fellow?   Link karma isnt real karma compared to comment karma.   More like, a lot of people are really horny. Some just happen to become famous.    Apples dont grow all the time so when they are in season they harvest a bunch extra and store them so that they can steadily distribute them throughout the year. This is why you always have a fresh supply of nice apples where as other fruits and vegetables are always out of season. The way that they keep the apples so long, in addition to selecting seeds for long lasting apples, is that they can control the atmosphere around the apple. Its oxygen for the most part that causes an apple to ripen and change colors and eventually go bad.   So they store crates of apples in this huge wharehouse with a low oxygen, high nitrogen and other gas mixture.   Now, the way OP's pic happens is that over the months of storage as the gas levels drop and humans enter and all that, some gasses escape this wharehouse and the nitrogen levels drop. You will get on the top crates apples that start aging much quicker. I have seen this happen, I play an apple engineer on reddit and have absolutely no idea what I am talking about.   The apple in OP's pic must have been at a boundary of the nitrogen and other gas mixture and the top half was exposed to oxygen and started aging and the bottom half was in this cryogenic life preserving gas and didnt age at all. You can trust me. I swear.    Thanks lol. And I googled before posting, and that guy was wrong.    Here's the thing. You said a "pelican is a seagull."  Is it in the same class? Yes. No one's arguing that.  As someone who is a redditor who studies pelicans, I am telling you, specifically, in science, no one calls seagulls pelicans. If you want to be "specific" like you said, then you shouldn't either. They're not the same thing.  If you're saying "aves class" you're referring to the taxonomic grouping of aves, which includes things from shoebills to sea eagles to toucans.  So your reasoning for calling a seagull a pelican is because random people "call the white ones pelicans?" Let's get grackles and blackbirds in there, then, too.  Also, calling someone a human or an ape? It's not one or the other, that's not how taxonomy works. They're both. A seagull is a seagull and a member of the aves class. But that's not what you said. You said a pelican was a seagull, which is not true unless you're okay with calling all members of the aves class pelicans, which means you'd call blue jays, ravens, and other birds pelicans, too. Which you said you don't.  It's okay to just admit you're wrong, you know?     Mine   Checkmate athiests   Yep   Yea I agree with you. It was sarcasm. That is the usual excuse the government gives in these cases and it is stupid but some people still eat it up and that is incredibly dangerous as you said.    I thought it was obvious sarcasm, but maybe not   But reddit imgur, amirite guise? cuz imgur only exists cuz of us so their community is baseless and not allowed to be their own.    Your normal user that wants to download that one lizzie maguire album and just read a tutorial from 2007, yea. Just because you know how to use a different DNS doesnt mean the "average" garden variety one off torrenter knows how to.    Then if you arent doing anything illegal why dont you just use a normal browser so we can track you and use it against you later? If you arent doing anything illegal then you dont have a reason to hide. Only criminals hide really, so clearly everyone on tor is a criminal.    While google's and Microsoft's policies may not be the best, there are still laws in the US. I doubt a judge would allow that on the off chance that they might be hosting tpb. It is akin to a judge granting a search warrant just in case you might be breaking the law. There has to be some evidence that they are actually using one of those servers, the same way that there has to be some evidence of you doing something or some reasonable suspicion that you are involved for a search warrant to be granted.   Now, that doesnt stop the possibility of a idiot judge letting it through or the government using shading NSA tactics and then making up a paper trail later to say it was legal, which they arent unkown to doing.   But with that said, I doubt it would be all that difficult to trace if one of your users was hosting a certain site, but im only a lawyer and web dev on reddit and have no experience with either in real life so im just talking out my ass. Tpb guys are smart and have a complicated system of redirects going on so its not like google can just check and say "oh this user is sending a lot to this ip that belongs to tpb." And for the same reason it is hard to track from the website to the server it is really being hosted on.    God doesnt real, lel   Got me my last date.    Dont worry about it too much. Just stop thinking about them watching you because they arent watching you, they are busy worring about you watching them, which you arent, because you are too busy thinking about them watching you while they are not watching you. Savy?  And you dont have to mantain eye contact every second.  Thats actually weirder than watching someone eat. Just look at your food and eat, and occasionally look up to make eye contain and verify to the other person you are still engaged.    Hitler literally as Hitler   As a bisexual, vegan atheist parent I am offended by your comment.      I hope at least   I woke up and had wet the bed.    Sing up for a reddit account.   Sleep. It feels so good, bare skin on crisp white sheets is amazing. Right after a shower, crawling into a warm bed is the best.    Gotta get on reddit bruh.    What did you do?   Listen to hybrid theory in order, the whole thing. Just do it.    Yea that and meteora are easily their greatest but I live everything from them   Suck a bag of dicks   I am an engineer and make more than you because I know more than you because I didnt make a mistake like get a business degree.   Monkey burger. So good. Havent had one in like a year.    I had sex once...   Stop controlling me. Let me do my own shit. Im 24 and dont care that you hate my SO, its my decision.  I dont have to call you every day to tell you what im doing, sorry if I get busy with work, im an adult now. Yea I have my own preferences now. Sorry I dont cut my hair the way you made me for 2 decades, I never liked it and can do it my way now. Stop complaining about it every time you see me. And sorry I havent started a phd yet... its my choice to do that when I want. A masters is enough for now, and you dont realize that the research isnt trivial. Dont belittle my job because you dont understand it. Im really not a bad kid, im just not you.    Yea especially when you are in an LDR. The sex is way less than you would like and so, yea.    Freeze. Just realizing that I never scream, stand still when im scared, and just generally stop and think everything, well overthink everything, through and eventually end up missing my opportunity most times.       My mom doesnt like my boyfriend either.    Maybe [this]( http://imgur.com/WpRX8Rv.jpg) prom pic can make up for it.       He is /r/otterable   I have never fingered myself when I type my password into the wrong box.       When you move things you require energy. the faster they move, the more energy they need. When you make your car go faster, for example, it burns more gasoline. Well, the math says that if you wanted to make your car move at the speed of light,  you would actually need infinite energy.   You cant have infinite energy. So you cant go the speed of light.    I like free   Why do we care about the button at all? I mean it's an interesting game of keeping the number away from zero, but other than that, this sub is devoid of content. Nothing beyond 6 colors and a timer. Yet why do we care so much about this program which in reality doesn't affect our lives at all?  (btw If you don't like reading, go read the TL;DR at the bottom)  I have watched this sub ever since the day it was born, and it has been interesting seeing the masses get so "excited" about this april fools joke. (Just to be sure I'm not saying that this whole sub isn't *nothing* but an april fools joke, the users have definitely turned this sub into something of meaning for themselves). But there shouldn't be this passion for the button. There is literally no earthly reason for there to be factions of colors and "discrimination" between them. And yet there is a community for it.  This whole brouhaha is very reminiscent of twitch plays pokemon. Yet the difference between twitch plays pokemon and r/thebutton is that watching a character being controlled by thousands of people in a game that almost everyone inputting commands has played is much more compelling to watch and to be apart of than watching a timer. And so the people who were a part of twitch plays pokemon *had* *a* *reason* to sit there and watch the screen. But watching the character get on and jump off a ledge became repetitive. So repetitive in fact that they gave personality to the pokemon (Abby, bird jesus, the false prophet). Those who watched created a religion (Praise helix). They tried to create reasons for why certain things happened (why they looked at the helix fossil so often). They were confronted with a void, and subsequently tried to fill it. And it was wonderful. It was arguably one of the greater internet sensations of this decade. And those who were *in* on it from the beginning had pride in what they were a part of. They felt like they belonged somewhere.  Now, once again we were confronted with something that is community based yet devoid of reliable entertainment. Many recognised this and tried to recreate the magic of TPP. The same thing could be argued for the Orangered/Periwinkle april fools. Hell, this sub was probably inspired by that.   But this isn't TPP. There is no reason to stay in this sub beyond literally watching a timer. It was soon apparent that it was difficult creating any meaningful OC, so we turned to something which worked before, factions/religions. Only this time, it was artificial. It grew too quickly, and was simply too forced to be anything like TPP. But we ignored the elephant in the room. We closed our eyes, put our hands over our ears, and shouted about how much fun this was.  Every person is desperate for a sense of belonging. We want to feel like they are a part of the group. We all want to be accepted. We all want to be able to say something, and have someone else back us up. Some of the actions on this sub can be attributed to this need of acceptance, but can you seriously argue that this many religions and factions can be created so quickly? For something that is so meaningless?   This whole sub is a circlejerk. Just social masturbation about how awesome we all are for choosing to take sides over pressing the button. We are all self aware about this situation. No one is seriously thinking that red's are better than purple's. They just want others to think, "woah those guys are so wacky, they created a whole RELIGION. They are so dedicated for something so meaningless. They are sooooooo interesting and funny".   This whole sub, down to it's very roots, is fake. And by saying that, I'm not saying that greys don't hate purples (not only because it's so freaking obvious), I'm saying that the very reason for typing in the words "filthy pusher" isn't *because* of the community. The people who type in "filthy pusher" are trying to *create* a community. They are trying to create a community that wouldn't have ever come about on its own. That is what is fake about all this. Its kind of sad in a way.  This sub is great as an idea, but everyone is so freaking self-aware of what they are doing. I know what this april fools joke was supposed to do. To create divide between people just like the Orangered/Periwinkle did. Except this time everyone knew how to act, and overemphasized the factions despite there being no reason to be on this sub at all. The Orangered/Periwinkle thing worked because it was the entirety of reddit, people had a reason to go on reddit that was much greater than simply bashing the other color.  Now this may not matter to you, but for me, I really hate it when people try to indirectly steer a topic/community/conversation/idea/etc into a direction it would have never gone to if we all would have just called out the bullshit. Call me cynical, but let things grow naturally on their own.  TL;DR   **This sub's community is not 'real' in a sense. It has never been honest. People realized that, and forced it in anyway. The only reason why this bastardized community exists is because we all want to be a part of the next TPP or Orangered/Periwinkle.**            Ive never done it before in a speedsolving sense. I l've played around with roux before but never really done serious solves. I was dumb and didnt review some stuff before I began the solves or practice or whatever. I ended up figuring out to place DF and DB, then orient and then permute. And I knew the orientation algs from bld and I use [MU] algs for H and Z perms but the second solve I got a U perm.  I completely froze and then messed up. I ended up figuring out to use MU2M'U2 which is a 3-cycle I use in bld, and then just setting up the U perm to be solved with that alg.   Once I figured that out and got the hang of it, the last 3 solves went ok.      e4 e5 52 74 b4 e8 25 41 2f 76 a9 25 53 2d 55 48  97 cc 37 14 47 5d 68 3a 71 5b 4c 6b 05 3a 06 07  e6 8d 11 22 b9 15 de

method.  I was doing zz before but I might switch to this. Do you have a website with algorithms or something?  Step 6 looks a little tricky, but I guess its comparable to Eoline or something.    Dude, the yellow cross. its done already. Thats it. Then you move on to step 2.    Im not a cfop solver anymore, but here is some motivation for [multislotting]( http://cubeloop.com/?page_id=327). Also check out badmephisto's [advanced f2l]( http://badmephisto.com/f2l.php).   Note that the most improvement can be found in first moving your normal f2l algs into muscle memory (so practice on not intuitively breaking up the pair and doing sexymove) and also on getting good at look ahead (while doing the cross start tracking the first pair and while executing each pair start tracking the next pair). Some thing that will help with look ahead is to slow down and plan ahead as far as you can, speed will come with time.   That said, on to multislotting. Something you can do is when you get a scramble, redo the scramble multiple times and try to solve a different f2l pair first each time. By mixing up how you do them, you might find that after execution, the next pair is lined up perfectly. When you see this, stop and undo what you did. Check the pattern and try to memorize it. Write it down somewhere. Then later on when you are solving, see if you can fit the pieces into some of those patterns you found.    http://cube.crider.co.uk/algtrans.html   But for things like k4 or a jumping off point to zbll, they are good to have. And with practice it can get close. After COLL, 75% of the time you will have a U perm or a skip. I think that makes up for it.    Ive read that about sune cases. Everyone seems to hate them. The recognition is not too hard. At least not as bad as people make it seem. Look for a pair of opposite stickers on the top layer. They will either be diagonal, horizontal, or vertical. Once you found those two stickers, you only need to match one more.   For example,  for sune (do antisune on a cube to set it up now so you can see what I am saying) you have the diagonal case. U of UFR and U of UBL are opposites. I like to match with L of ULF and so I check and find that U of UBL matches L of ULF. So that is sune.   If, instead UBL and LFU didnt match (do R U2 r' F R' F' r U' R U' R' U2 to set it up) you see the diagonal like for sune, and then you see that UBL and LFU dont match, so you know to do the other alg.   For the vertical bar case (UFR and URB are adjacents) you have to make a slight modification and compare URB with LFU because UBL isnt part of the pair.   Niklas is a horizontal bar (UBL and URB adjacents) with no match (UBL and LFU are different)  It takes some practice but I find that its not much more difficult than the bowtie cases.   **2x2**: 10.48, 15.81,9.48,19.51,12.08 = 12.79  **3x3**: 29.18, 29.56, 27.18, 23.73,27.07=27.81  **4x4**: 3:11, 2:48,3:30,3:07,2:14=3:02  **OH**: 59.45,54.04,56.89,1:07.59,45.57=56.79  **2gen**:12.27,10.74,7.55,26.98,10.60=11.2  **LSE**: 2:00.62, 2:50.33,14.78,18.15, 15.84= 51.54  **OHPLL**:  7.64, 5.57,7.59,4.76,6.32=6.93  That spread on [MU] lol.   Im a couple days late, but I want to add something and you might appreciate it. When you have a corner and bottom layer edge paired on the somewhere on the cube, some times the other corner is 1 or 2 moves away from being placed with this 2x1 block. So you end up with the 3x1x1 block and if you are used to cfop insertions, you will have to break it up. Or you can learn the 3 cases and solve an entire f2l block in a 7 move alg or so. That is just an example of the freedom of blockbuilding everyone else is talking about.    Oh ok, I understand. Sorry.   On ebay canada I saw some Zhanchis for like 10-15 bucks, some moyu's for the same price. On auction you can save a couple bucks if you have the time.   But yea, hit up the general discussion thread and Im sure a canadian can help you out more with cheaper cubes in canada.      Lmao M2 OH   Lol 100 in an hour (on the high end) is reasonable too. That would be insane.   	122
 By some measures, the population has been much better off in pre-capitalist societies. Many economic historians now admit that early factory workers experienced a sharp decline in living standards. And see this interesting abstract: http://ssh.dukejournals.org/content/28/2/211.abstract As measured by height, the health of early Dark Age Europeans was better than that achieved by a century and a half of applying Adam Smith. I am reading Savage Continent, Keith Lowe's account of the tragedy of post-WW2 Europe, In it, he touches on an oft cited fact, that when wartime imposed food and health care rationing on capitalist Britain, "the general health of the population actually improved...".  I suppose my point is that reality is more complex than what has been imagined by Karl Marx, Adam Smith or even Ayn Rand.    Edward Bernays was the nephew of Sigmund Freud. Pioneered the use of psychology in advertising, public relations and propaganda.   A companion to this article was posted here today, The Trillion Dollar Oil Swindle, which asserts that the projected demand for crude oil has been consistently underreported, as part of a high level conspiracy to hold down its price and maintain the limping pace of the global economy. Considering that the current price is near or under the costs of new production (especially that from unconventional resources), and that most of the exporting nations need significantly higher prices to preserve their domestic tranquility, I at first doubted this presumed conspiracy could be maintained against such powerful interests. However, reflecting on the proposed deal with Iran, which will place more oil on the market and further depress its price, a high-level collusion makes more sense. Why else would Obama risk the ire of the Gulf States, Israel and fire-eating neo-conservatives, if it were not to delay another economic collapse? Here is another wild speculation: Falling oil prices are strong incentive for the Gulf States to intensify their current war with Iran.    Can capitalism thrive without its cronies? I suspect cronyism is an essential feature, not bug in capitalism. (Did I employ that meme correctly?) Seriously, this discussion has me placing Karl Polanyi's The Great Transformation on my need-to-read list.   A clear illustration of how devastating even a low-tech, lower intensity-density civilization can devastate an ecosystem, and this rapid exhaustion of US forests for construction materials and fuel would spur the transition to iron and coal. Also pertinent to this discussion is the impact of Pre-Columbian civilizations on the forest cover of the Western hemisphere -- a popular account is the book 1491, by Charles C. Man. Two centuries before the migration of William Penn, that landscape is now thought to have been much less sylvan. Though the Amerindians were more thoughtful stewards of the land, from both by necessity and from belief, their impact on total biomass had to be considerable. We have the cautionary example of the Maya civilization and its collapse, but how sustainable were the woodland cultures of eastern North America?   Sorry. Attempts at brevity make my thoughts more arcane. What I suggest is while the democratic citizen is becoming irrelevant, the 'democratic consumer' is increasingly heeded by the corporate sector. Vote for whom or what you will, but your elected government hearkens to its corporate master's voice. In contrast, corporations are quick to react to the most marginal threat to their bottom line. What percentage of NASCAR enthusiasts are greatly offended by the display of the Confederate flag? The competitors that hope to be the presidential nominee of the GOP are reluctant to condemn Donald Trump's inflammatory statements on Mexican immigrants, but business partners are quick to dump him. The rulers of China understand that political stability is best achieved by catering to personal consumption, rather that enhancing civil rights or liberties. I hope this clarifies my thinking, such as it is.    Scientists estimate that the Earth contained approximately 1,000 billion tons of carbon in living biomass 2,000 years ago. Since that time, humans have reduced that amount by almost half. It is estimated that just over 10 percent of that biomass was destroyed in just the last century.  This implies that the majority of the biomass loss occurred prior to the 20th century, when the human population increased slowly from a few hundred million to two billion, with minimal energy derived from fossil fuels. If so, that is very alarming  even primitive horticulture, if practiced by hundreds of millions, is not sustainable. Does the full paper make a distinction between the losses due to human activity, and what might have been lost by natural cycles, e.g. the expansion of some of the worlds deserts? Unlike economics, everything obeys the laws of thermodynamics; it is the most undeniable of the sciences. William S. Burroughs observed in his book, Naked Lunch: Thermodynamics has won at a crawl   	7
 Just send it son!    yay! Congratulations. Telling people about anxiety makes you feel amazing. Like your no longer carrying the burden alone. This is the beginning of improvement friend! You are on the path :)    They wanted a futuristic robot in a film so they...literally built a futuristic robot...   No but I will :) I'm glad I could give you some motivation however brief :)   Hey! That's awesome man I really wanna get good at it. As for feeling like you want to delete your comments, fuck that. Be proud of anything that you say. Don't regret it. Being an honest person is honorable and nothing to be ashamed of.    I'd read it! Also, writing doesn't even have to be a public thing. Sometimes I write just to myself to let it out. Feels a bit weird at first almost like you are incriminating yourself and you almost feel shy about writing your deepest darkest thoughts despite the fact that its only to yourself. But once you do, oh boy do improvements start happening. Once you can acknowledge and talk about your deepest fears in a casual manner and actually analyze them as mere thoughts you are literally making yourself more powerful by conquering your fears.    Fuck that man. You can do it. Its time you start making decisions to make yourself feel better. And talking about your problems no matter how bad you don't want to is the first step.   Also, I see you like rubiks cubes. I solved my first 3 by 3 one the other day. Never felt so proud of myself :)   Thanks so much for opening up :) Its so good to talk about these things because now it isn't something stuck in your head for you only. You've shared it and now people who read your comment will know of your problem too so it feels less like something you've got pent up inside you as you've actually shared it. You say you are exhausted with being worried about things happening to your family. If it will give you any peace of mind, nothing bad is going to happen. You have to ask yourself, whats the point in being sad about what hasn't happened when you could be enjoying time with your family now? You need to practice being in the present as opposed to worrying about the future or thinking about the past. (Look up 'Mindfulness' by mark Williams) Relax about the exams, you will try your best and if you don't do well so be it.   As for the OCD, I think it would really do you good to just pay a visit to a doctor or a psychiatrist. Don't do this on your own, people want to help and it feels so good to share the burden of anxiety by just talking about how you feel. It makes you feel 10x more normal.   But above all. Seriously well done for sharing. Because before 10 minutes ago your problems existed solely in your mind but you've begun sorting shit out now by actually speaking about it and that is seriously something to be proud of. :)    Yay! Good job! :)    It's such a shame too because it shouldn't be something to have to do anonymously. Mental health is so serious and the fact that people can't open up to their families and loved ones but instead prefer to talk anonymously online really shows how backwards society has it at the moment. I really truly hope that in the future it will be something that people would bring up and talk about to their families like having a cold rather than having to hide it and talk to people they do not know for help.   But at the same time, it's kinda beautiful that all these different people who are struggling from the same thing come together in a community wherein people completely open up and others actually care and respond despite not knowing them. :) makes me feel all warm and mushy inside :')   Are you kidding?! Every couple and every person has problems, some a lot deeper and more fucked up than yours! When feeling down its easy to look at others and assume they have it all figured out and everything is perfect but that's the point. You don't see their behind the scenes. Its completely normal to have problems. That's not to say its right or you should do it  but you shouldn't feel un-ordinary about it. Watch the film "American Beauty" if you haven't. Not only is it a great film but I feel it gives a good representation of a what goes on in seemingly "perfect" relationships or families.  	11
 Can a man suffering from performance anxiety be forced into having an erection? No. However, that doesn't mean that another man who doesn't suffer from performance anxiety cant become forcibly aroused, nor that that man with said condition can't later overcome his anxiety, and later be forcibly aroused.   Performance anxiety and what you're describing as rape, are two completely different things. There's so much more to an erection than the want to have sex. Not to mention the fact that consent isn't as easy as black and white. Also, you're assuming that male rape is when a man has penal-vaginal intercourse with a woman.   Were I available, I would take you in a manly fashion.   Welcome to Game of Thrones!   Nope, that's her biological brother.

Analyze how you can achieve the cabling from your TV to that antenna placement. 1. Act upon your knowledge.  Determine a wiring route.  Measure twice, and buy (at least) a few feet more than (you think) you need.  For my current residence, I ran it under the living room rug, around the perimeter of the room.  Its a longer run, but it doesnt get stepped on or felt/seen in any way when walking through the area.  I also took the opportunity to run other advantageous wiring across the room under the rug.  At a previous residence I used a staple gun to tack the wiring around the wall baseboard, at the crease with the floor.  If you need ideas, Home Depot has tools and accessories for projects like this.   Wait a minute.  Are you suggesting that "admin" is synonymous with "administrator"?   Congrats. You still have a problem with English, but good for you for your google search.    They'd have to fly everyone to San Diego.   I said "probably".  If you consider the entirety of the united states and the listings of all ordinances online, my statement of "probably" is absolutely correct across the board.  So no, your google presponse of "probably" is statistically incorrect.   No, it probably wont.  Dumpster Diving laws are defined by local regulation.  Most municipalities do not post such ordinances online.   To change the name intentionally yet without purpose detracts from the origin.   It's AMAgeddon , not #TheDarkening   Can anyone recommend a game/server where characters have moral fortitude, stand up for what they believe in, and act as a unified team with their compatriots?  I've been a previous fan of Left4Dead for these reasons, but I'm looking for a larger group-play option.  And I'd really like to play on servers were the admin/mods listen to the players, and move forward with decisions that everyone wants - and not just what seems advantageous for attracting more future players.  Any recommendations would be appreciated, thanks!!!   /r/topgear has gone private/dark.   The issue actually is not about her getting fired.  The consequences of her being fired were the straw that broke the camels back for many mods that depended on her.  The underlying problem is admin/mod communications.  Many subs are not directly effected by this problem and operate autonomously.  But that doesn't mean that there isnt just cause to show solidarity.  I am an American.  This was dictated but not read.  My gf is Irish and I'm originally from Boston, so sometimes I actually give a crap about you fuckers. :-)   I think ending in time for EST morning traffic is a copout.  A proper protest would last 24 hours so that everyone world-wide is exposed to it accordingly.   Please mods, keep a handle on what is getting posted here for all that sweet sweet karma.  There is an increase in BS posts whose details have been proved false hours ago.   fake.  stop spreading rumor mill bullshit.   Well...  Whats better than reddit?  VOAT is just an alternative.  Right now there really isnt anything "better" than reddit.   You have got to be the biggest cocksmoker of the year.  Why the fuck are you instigating shit?  What the fuck is wrong with you?   the mods chickens   you no browse popular subreddits!   Please share this in higher profile subreddits, like /r/SubredditDrama.  Make sure this point gets added to the conversation regarding admin/mod communications.   Ahh, of course...  reports.  Like /user/KnotKnox has been shown to have, I'm sure she's getting tons of them.  Still surprised it can affect an admin-level user.  Thanks for the knowledge.   You're right.  Any idea on why automoderator would do this?  I didnt even consider this a possibility given the subreddit and the discussion.   CSS trickery.  Its not even gone dark.   ARE YOU *really* FUCKING SORRY?!   ~~Ellen Pao is deleting her posts:~~  ~~https://np.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/3byaei/reddit_alternatives_other_subs_going_private_to/csr0by6~~  She's not.  As \user\I_LOVE_HOOKERS pointed out below, her comments are visible under her profile.    Many of the default subs came back online before EST, because they are cowards.   Yes, please.  It doesn't contribute, and it only serves to trivialize the situation.      some of kk's recent posts really make me question if he is right for the job that some people are inferring he should get.  edit: grammar    Which makes me seriously wonder if there is some sort of ruse going on.  I mean, he knows how this shit works.  His replies regarding it are seriously fucking amature-hour.    AMAgeddon   no it didnt.   I'm talking about any serious "AMAgeddon" coverage coming from /r/news.  It doesn't really exist, and isn't at all necessary at this point.  That ship has sailed.   Oh, no kidding.  Its only the colored outer skin?  :-/   This sub absolutely never ceases to amaze me with NGE-related content.

Its already being aptly covered by multiple subreddits that specialize in this sort of issue.  So, /r/news might as well show solidarity and go dark anyway.  There are lots of "news" sources outside of reddit.  Hit the admins where it hurts with your 5.9m subscriber stats.   This isnt a dig against foreign languages.  This is to stop gang-speak.

This subreddit has (as far as I can tell) an active scanner that is collecting stats for subreddits that have gone private since "AMAgeddon" began.  https://www.reddit.com/r/GoldTesting/comments/3bypzz/amageddon_tracking/   This subreddit has (as far as I can tell) an active scanner that is collecting stats for subreddits that have gone private since "AMAgeddon" began.  https://www.reddit.com/r/GoldTesting/comments/3bypzz/amageddon_tracking/   I've seen the responses.  I have been reading through related threads both present and past four 4+ hours now.  I didnt know who Ellen Pao was before today.  I previously could have cared less.  After today's events and what I have read: *I care.*  talking in comments isnt protesting - its discussing.  thats what we typically do on reddit: we discuss things.  protesting is taking action against something, and in this case the protest is using silence.  we cant protest in our discussions because, a) its useless, because b) we cannot interact in any meaningful way with the admins.  you obviously dont care about the issue at hand, and that's fine.  you don't have to be vested in this, or care what direction the site is going in.  and I dont mean that in a sarcastic or demeaning manner.  reddit, like many sites, is a tool.  Use or care for the tool how you want.  If you dont care, then dont complain about it.   They seem to be quite on-board with all the privateering.  /r/Portugal is also.  My favorite translated quote from there is:   hoje  dia de cozido caralho! onde  que vou comer agora?  Which translates roughly to, *"today is cooked ass! where am I going to eat now?"*    You are typing a lot here, but you are missing a lot of research.  A lot of "mods" (particularly non-active or non-default mods) dont have a real understanding of what is going on.   No one is screaming.  This is a silent protest against months of admin/mod improprieties.     Watching NGE for the first time is kinda like taking a hallucinogenic drug (acid, ecstasy, etc).  You really should do it with an experienced friend.   You could try better rice.  Minute rice is craptastic imho - but, I might be a bit of a rice snob.  Different rices add different flavor nuances as well as textures.  My go-to rice is Nishiki.  Do yourself a huge favor and buy a proper rice cooker.   The wikipedia article that OP linked to has instructional links.   you submitted this same image (2) days ago.  wtf.   its a good thing that pic was [re]posted here, because /r/funny is private right now.   because shaming fat people can get you shadowbanned/fired/reddit-roulette-wheeled      Jesus Christ, learn how to spell ***Reich!***  ^^Fucking ^^nazis ^^these ^^days...   Its not about her.  Its about how the loss of her position was handled.  There is a lot of mod-related procedure that was broken because of her sudden departure.  This was the proverbial *straw that broke the camels back* in terms of mod/admin relations.   Nice watermark.  Couldn't get your blackness from a reputable source?   when I was still learning to speak, I called trucks, "fucks".   I love it when multiple redditors see the same tragic events!   Apparently reddit cant deduce sarcasm from phrasing anymore.  You gotta end everything with a "/s" to make it perfectly clear or people will waa on you.   They aren't oranges.  They are ***tang***erines.       Well, how do you say it?  dah-rums?   holy crap.  I'm exhausted just from watching that.   but the subs going dark isnt about Victoria specifically, but the very poor admin/moderator relations since Pao took power at reddit.   Its the law.  And it has to be illuminated in case of a power outage.   You no browse subreddits!   yay marriage equality!   I think that solidarity in going dark for the issues that you speak to would speak volumes more to the reddit admins than this message ever so elegantly does.   That's what this /r/SubredditDrama and /r/OutOfTheLoop are for.  It makes people involved by having to figure out just wtf is happening.  It engages discovery.   Dont know off-hand, but its referenced in the /r/OutOfTheLoop discussion.   Yes.  Please.  And, thank you.   SIGNED  ^^^DICTATED ^^^BUT ^^^NOT ^^^READ   Dont downvote this.  This is just a link to a version of this page that doesnt hide the downvote button with CSS.    I HAVE BEEN D.ARK.ENED WITH DISSAPOINT.   After reading many of the posts here and in other subs on reddit regarding this, and other recent admin grievances; I'm beginning to think maybe someone at reddit got the wrong take-away message from season 3 of Orange Is The New Black.   Why is it that I don't believe you?     How much hurt would it be to "our users" for a day's worth of dissent?  I'm a bit disappointed in the PC Master Race on this day...   Thats really not what I was implying, but phrasing I guess...    I personally feel like shutting /r/science down as well, that's how much of a bad taste this leaves.   Please do.

Please, someone local to Chicago, please start a local/grassroot outcry to your local BS.  Only standing united can crap like this be stopped before it starts.   Aziz!  Light!   OP.  I highly recommend you acquire a higher resolution scan of that photo.  No one can do anything with the image you posted.   I was just being facetious.  I know that "hunting" comes in many forms.   10/10 would still choke   It was until they figured-out way to monetize.     Too similar  Really?  Does it have to be something "different"?  Why cant it be like what we have now, but without the changes that we dont like?  Wouldn't we want to stay if these things weren't taking place?   This is all seems so suspicious sounding. All of this, just because an issue with Victoria?  I mean, even if you got rid of a single specific person for whatever reason; why would you 'private' a top-level subreddit?  I would think that there are so many other things you could do before resorting to this move unless the entire mod team is imploding in there.   So, did your boss try to talk you down on the price?  	129
    Yes.   Just in case anyone's wondering, this is from a horror manga called [Glyceride](http://openawesome.com/junji-ito-horror-manga/glyceride.html) by Junji Ito.      I think that this is just this sub in general.   I mean this: http://www.clker.com/cliparts/6/S/W/2/g/t/transparent-red-no-circle-hi.png   This is what the Nazi's fought to prevent.   Fallout: New Vegas. It's worth checking out, especially since Fallout 4 is coming out soon.   I think it says in the starting screen that the only reason they survived was because of how isolated many of the reservations are, as well as the fact that  they preserved some of their old traditions which translated to survival on the continent now that it's more like pre-columbian north america than it is today.   That sounds like something an *SJW* would say...    Wait... There are people down there!?!?!   What mod is this? Sorry I don't really play many but this doesn't look like the vanilla game to me.   This is all heresy.   /r/thatHappened    I'm not sure, maybe whenever they're raised by an orthodox ruler it counts as at war, but for some reason I didn't have the option to vassalise them.   Expel the holy sphelcure or whatever it's called. This messed me up in my Rome game and is super annoying, as that holy order always takes baronies and makes me wonder why some things aren't working.   You're already dead, Omae wa mou shindeiru.   Our future folks.   Signed, totally not the police.   That second guy looks like quite the euphoric gentlesir   People like this would have been locked up in an asylum a while ago. And rightly so might I add.   Funny how these people are only allowed to say these things by the free speech that the USA upholds.   Ahh, the joys of Capitalism   I think OP may be the teen in the video and he's trying to tell us what ended up happening.   revolt risk -1.0%   Whenever I'm down or sad or feeling apathetic I just come to this sub and look at this one image. It always makes me feel better.   I think decadence revolts are event-spawn, hence no attrition.   Despite the fact that we can all agree that the Liberal  garbage propaganda fed to college students is disgusting and should stop. The ethicacy of manipulating someones political views are shaky at best. Remember, we should strive to be better our enemies, not be on the same level as or worse than.   I'm not sure of the event ID's but the event that tells you it's going to occur soon happened to me in the late 2800's and the actual even happened in that same time period.   I fired the event and it gave me a window saying "you're not supposed to see this" I selected the only option and I got the window saying the election was over with a random lowborn receiving over 2000 votes and he was the only candidate. I took this to be a glitch and killed him with console, upon his death the elections began again and they went through without a hitch with me being elected.  Thanks for the help. I feel really appreciative that someone on the mod team would help me troubleshoot this.   Thanks. I'll try this out tomorrow when I get the opportunity and see if it works.   I'm not sure if any other candidates died or not. But the odd thing is I've played for a bit more at this point and its been a good 20-25 years since our last president. I noticed the "election season nears a close" event thing hasn't fired yet. Is there any way I could get it to fire manually via console?   So I'm playing as an Americanist character in the 'After the End' mod and I control what is pretty much the largest realm in the game. Other than some characters down in Florida I also control all Americanist characters and provinces. So, the president of the USA died a few years ago and since then I have been campaigning the become the next president. I have the overwhelming majority of votes, with over 1000 whereas my closest competitor only has 80-ish. But the problem is that the election has been running for the past 5 years. I tried restarting my game twice and it didn't fix the glitch. My best guess is that it hasn't triggered the 'elections nearly over' event yet, so it hasn't ended the elections.  Anyone got any ideas to fix this?   You only have one problem. You're not Americanist.  All hail the founding fathers.   Me fail English? That's unpossible!   Me fail english? Thats unpossible!   we always need more boosters!      Weird, I was listening to some music by Sabaton when I saw this. I didn't know they had a game and I'll be sure to check it out!   And damn these pagans are powerful.   Well, it's not tough when you have the Roman Empire's borders reclaimed and a 100K deathstack, but imagine facing them when Europe is extremely fractured and you only control a relatively small plot of land. Yeah, a lot tougher.  	41
 Melvin had warning signs for like 2 seasons before he completely fell off the cliff though   You're just doing a Chris Carter impersonation aren't you   Did you not see [this](http://grantland.com/the-triangle/2015-mlb-detroit-tigers-defensive-improvement-nick-castellanos/)? He may not be as good as you hoped but he's clearly working at it.   Whoops, thank you!      Wow that's actually really really cool. And we all get a great game out of it to boot.   Let me go through point by point:   There has [sic] been little to no rumblings regarding Sosh since the 02 run  Wrong. He was on the hot seat as recently as last year. Then he went and led the team to 98 wins and that talk died out.   The tenure of players like Blanton   Frieri  Both of whom were in the positions they were in largely due to a lack of organizational options. Frieri was good for awhile here, and people hailed him as the bullpen savior. Then he went sour, and naturally people wanted him out. Sosh would've put someone else out there if he'd had good options. He didn't, so out Frieri went again.  Blanton was the same way. You really think Sosh would've kept running him out there if he had other options? He absolutely did not have other options. Blanton was worth trying, solely because the alternatives were just as miserable.   the absolute stop light to the running game  One thing Sosh does not get nearly enough credit for is managing to his current roster. Sosh likes to run, it's well-documented. You know why he doesn't run with this squad? Because it's not a team that's equipped to run. Trout is the only guy with plus speed, and thus is the only guy who steals bags. You really want him sending guys like Aybar, who is not a good base stealer, just to say he has the running game going? No, you'd complain about how he sends runners when he shouldn't, and how that's a good reason for him to be fired.  Sosh teaches base running very well; his teams' track record will prove that. This just happens to be probably the worst running team he's ever managed. And we still go 1st to 3rd and score on sac flies quite well, given how slow our team is.   A Yankees payroll of players  Take that up with Tony Reagins and Arte. Those two are directly responsible for every huge deal we've thrown at someone during Sosh's tenure with the exception of Trout (whose deal I hope you don't take exception with or I'm wasting my time here completely)   He's the longest tenured manager in baseball   his team's [sic] have regularly fallen short of expectations for 10 straight years  Wrong. Wrong wrong wrong. Last year's team was not even on anyone's radar as best team in baseball. Most people had us out of the playoffs. We've had a huge amount of success under Sosh. The only stretch that can be construed as otherwise is the 5 years between 2009 and 2014 where we missed the playoffs, and that was largely due to an extremely competitive AL West, transitioning between core groups of players, and some really bad contracts that hampered our flexibility.   The thing managers should get credit for, above all else, is maintaining clubhouse morale and cohesiveness, as well as managing playing time and the pitching staff without egregious errors. Sosh has done this to a T since he's been here. Whenever he's had a bullpen to work with, he's used it like a scapel. I'm stoked we have him as our manager. There's a reason he's the longest tenured skipper in the bigs, and has been around longer than all the managers in the AL Central combined. But hey, if you want to end a good thing, by all means. Call for his head.   yes yes yes yes yes!   These things happen, no worries man   For sure, doesn't come off as sarcasm in the initial post. All good my friend   The Reds' call was posted a bit further down. I assumed the post I responded to was referring to the video in the title post, which is indeed the Tigers' call.   It crosses state lines. Not sure if you knew this, but Houston is in Texas.   I wouldn't say they have been at any staggering rate. Nothing Sosh is doing this season is staggeringly bad; the team's just scuffling, so people want a scapegoat. Call it what it is: people want to bitch when we lose.   How does Indiewire hire? Who are you guys reading?    I wish we could get one for the ALW but everyone hates the Angels anyway. Not to mention the Angels sub is pretty toxic as it is.   It's confirmation bias at its most elemental and basic, but okay.   Yes, you knew right away that he would GIDP. Thank you, oh high and mighty mind reader.   Well it was the Tigers' station.   Reds   He's been working on his arm strength for over a year now, and it's showing up big time. Last night before our game, he threw a ball from the left field foul line over the fence in right field, which is 15 feet tall in Anaheim. He had a game-saving outfield assist against Colorado earlier this year. He's getting better.   That's why I said claim to influence, not legitimate influence. Although a lot of those problems could be solved by getting involved with their union.   Notice I said claim; the actual legitimacy of that power is a lot dicier. However, there's an argument to be made, whereas the Koch brothers are just rich dudes whose money buys them wanton influence.   Nazca Grill is pretty good, off of Genesee.   I would imagine it has something to do with unions being made up of lots of people, and thus having a better claim to wielding a large influence. Whereas the Koch brothers are two dudes, and only claim to represent their own interest.  Basically, the unions' level of influence is based upon their large memberships, so they can claim to speak for a lot of people; the Kochs speak only for themselves, but have a wildly disproportionate amount of influence for being only 2 people.     Game just wouldn't have changed. Eshelman wasn't giving up a run, and he wasn't coming out of the game. We'd have won.  That being said, it's not what happened.   **This Is Water** by Jess Walter. Contemporary, funny, really good. He strikes a tough-to-achieve balance between readable and literary for contemporary fiction.  **Brief Interviews With Hideous Men** by David Foster Wallace. A fantastic look at sex and love and commitment. Probably the only book of his (other than Everything and More, which isn't nearly as widely read) that really focuses in on one grouping of themes. **Oblivion** is also fantastic.   Mariners   I love Todd Frazier, so good to see him raking. He just seems like a great guy   His foot feels better than it ever has since he got to Anaheim, and he's crushing the ball as a result.   Kole is a great leadoff guy. Easily the best leadoff player on our roster right now.  The question is, can we afford to spare him and put him elsewhere.   Had a bad feeling about our chances as soon as the weather delay knocked Esh out. We acquitted ourselves well, but just don't have the firepower. I'm sad.   Well, I was at Dave Roberts only game ever as manager I guess\  EDIT: obviously he might/almost for sure will get a chance at a permanent manager's gig at some point.   Who you calling pal, friend    I'm not sure I would call their basketball program excellent   Well for starters a program generally includes many different sports, not just basketball  Stop talking out of your ass haha     San Diego has gorgeous weather, but it's cloudy every once in a while   Yes, were it not for the rainout it's hard to imagine Vandy getting this one, but give them some credit. Peitzmeier left the ball up in the 9th and they hammered it every time.   Clutch isn't a thing, statistically. We had extraordinarily bad luck.   More delays, starting at 2 local time now.  Gotta favor Vandy to get Eshelman out of there with a 3 run lead.   As a counterpoint to some of the people ITT claiming suicide is selfish and unforgiveable:   People pontificate, "Suicide is selfishness." Career churchmen like Pater go a step further and call in a cowardly assault on the living. Oafs argue this specious line for varying reason: to evade fingers of blame, to impress one's audience with one's mental fiber, to vent anger, or just because one lacks the necessary suffering to sympathize. Cowardice is nothing to do with it - suicide takes considerable courage. Japanese have the right idea. No, what's selfish is to demand another to endure an intolerable existence, just to spare families, friends, and enemies a bit of soul-searching.  -David Mitchell, *Cloud Atlas*    That's the spirit   You gotta get through the first 100, then it really picks up   Can we all just admit that covering NFL receivers and hitting MLB pitching are both incredibly hard things to do, and that you would likely have very little success at either if you had not worked at it for a long time?  Jeez.   Not gonna lie, I laughed   More like we picked a hell of a time to go 1 for 22 with RISP haha, but whatever floats your boat  EDIT: Thanks for the downvotes, they were super clutch   I appreciate what you're trying to say here, but it's the attitude of a person who hasn't felt those flames. I'm not saying it can't be beaten, but the power of mental illness is that it denies context. It's incredibly difficult to overcome without help, and its power is that it feels insurmountable in the most immediate and direct way possible.    The Angels have not been in the playoffs since signing Pujols.   We had the best record in baseball last year..   Middle of the infield has more ground to cover, so it's considered more demanding than the corners. As a result, they get more balls hit their way, or into areas where they're the one who needs to make the play.  2B is considered easier than SS largely because of the arm question. The throw is much shorter, so you have more time to throw and you don't need as strong of an arm to be able to record outs.  Basically, shortstops need both a strong arm (for the longer throw, like the 3B) and a greater range (because they have more ground to cover, like the 2B)   I do   Balls and strikes, and whether or not a fielder touched second while turning a double play.   20 HR power is a big deal, especially out of a catcher. Just saying.   He's not moving to pitcher..   In defense of the pick: from what I understand, the teams were a lot higher on Ward than the draft experts were. The Angels draft room was celebrating because they were actually not expecting him to be available when we drafted.  Welcome Taylor, best of luck!   Not disagreeing with anything you're saying other than that the call was confirmed, not upheld, which means they saw something on the video that made them think the call was correct, not that they didn't have enough evidence to overturn it. Hell, I don't know what evidence that was, but that was the ruling..   He'll hit some if it's innings-based. At that point it's more of an incentive for not getting hurt than any performance though. But he will get less opportunities if he sucks, and that will make it hard to hit any incentive, even if it's just appearances or innings pitched.   Still, incentives are performance-based. If he doesn't perform well, he will not receive most of that money, unless the Cubs suck at writing incentive clauses.   He's not getting incentives if he sucks.   I think people mostly say it because he comes off as kinda douchey sometimes. The only effect it has on his game is what you're saying, sometimes he commits silly fouls out of emotion.   *King Solomon's Mines* is a classic that seems to fit what you're looking for. *Two Years Before the Mast* is also great, although maybe a little outside your specified range.   Coming out July 31st!   Basically this. The foot changed him as a player. He's still a very good one, just not the guy we got used to.   100% on board with this. That's why Texas is scaring me right now.   Yes! This would be awesome.   Whoa, never knew that was a slur. Good to have that knowledge to avoid accidents.   Studs Terkel's work should be much more widely read.  I'm also a big fan of *The Boys of Summer* by Roger Kahn. Such an interesting piece of retrospection.   2002 was a great series though. And let us have just this one thing :( you have three newer shinies to play with.   Why is our organization run by shitheads.   Beautiful Ruins by Jess Walter deals a lot with the film world, and also happens to be one of my favorites. A great book.   Any Joseph Campbell should be pretty interesting to you. Edith Hamilton's *Mythology* is also a classic.   The comments made by the agent make it seem like Hornacek was contacted directly, which isn't allowed and thus forced Hornacek to refuse the request or be in violation of his contract.   Which would make sense with a lot of what people are saying about Pollard liking Otz and not wanting to do a real coaching search. He may have torpedoed his chances with Hornacek on purpose.   The western US before it was urbanized. Seeing the Sierras, the Pacific Northwest, the Grand Canyon, the Rockies, before cars and pollution and overcrowding and hunting and dams...would've been incredible.   We're also last in the majors in BABIP. The team as constructed is going to be given a little more time to work it out before any major tweaks will be made I think, unless a good deal comes along. I have faith in JeDi making the right move.   A healthy Miggy might have beat him again, which is where I disagree that Miggy should've beat him in the first place. But without Miggy, it's not even an argument. Just because it was Trout's weakest year doesn't mean he wasn't the MVP.    Bryce Harper will end up being a much better player than Mike Trout, who won't win another MVP  I disagree with you, but respectfully. You're not right, and you're not wrong either   Michael Brantley should have beaten him last year  Aaaand some opinions are unpopular because they are flat out wrong, like claiming the Moon landing never happened.   I only hate him cuz of 2005   I am honestly happy that Galarraga's perfect game got taken away on a blown call.   To me, Galarraga threw a perfect game. Everywhere except the record books will acknowledge that (and I guess some weird sticklers for technicality).  But the grace and forgiveness that Galarraga showed to Joyce, a man who clearly felt terrible about an honest mistake, was incredible, one of the noblest things I've seen. It gives me tears to think about, and it's the kind of thing I want to be able to show my kids as an example one day. One of the best moments of humanity in a game full of them. Galarraga has my utmost respect forever, because of how he conducted himself in that situation.   They did have flat bats way back when. The bats splintered on contact with baseballs, they realized it was dangerous, and they switched away.   He really does, his enthusiasm is contagious  Flip side of that is that of course he's having fun given how good he is, but still.   Glad I can pay it forward! I went to Fenway for the first time last Sunday when the Angels were there, and despite the fact that we lost, I had an incredible time. Great ballpark, and the fans went out of their way to be friendly and considerate and engage in good-natured banter while simultaneously talking about how good Trout was and all that..seriously made the experience even better, blew me away. So thank you!   You guys are the same number of games out of first as we are. You have ample opportunity to turn it around.   Trout's face in that is great too haha   I feel the same way, I legitimately like most of our division, just not when we're playing you guys   :)   Yeah I'm not mad about this at all. I want Josh to have success, and this made me grin like crazy at work   It's always quiet. But we got you :)   Please do!   I don't think you'll regret it!  Let me clarify though, it doesn't explicitly deal with death. It centers on an old man whose life is clearly winding down, and the existential questions that come into play with that. It got me thinking about death, but more accurately it's about the end of life (in part; there are other things at work obviously. It's a fantastic piece of literature).   *Disgrace* by JM Coetzee is a haunting look at a life winding down. Wouldn't recommend it if you're not ready to wrestle with the themes though. But if you're willing to go there, it's great.   That sounds awesome, will do!   This exceeds even my absurdly high expectations and now I know I need to see it. I'm even more pumped to go someday now.   Cowgill is our current tenured ex-Met, Kirk's gotta earn it.   Also, how cool were the High School Championships? From everything I've read, it's a bucket list event for me. Is it hard to get tickets? What's the atmosphere around it like?   What's the biggest difference in the culture of the game there? Let's split hairs too: biggest on-field/gameplay cultural difference and biggest difference in the surrounding culture (front offices, fans, stadiums, anything).  	92
 That makes her a boer more then likely not african.   Seriously?   I see 3 different ethnic groups in this competition alone.    Yes idiot. That's the general consensus of how land claims are established, in part it's longevity and simply living there that enshrines this. The natives also settled the majority of america, look up their early civilization before small pox and other diseases arrived with the new world, the native's we know are the result of what a Apocalypse would look like after 90% of their population died off.

The kids in question bypassed pre-installed software to stop them from changing their desktop, somebody on here stated that's not hacking when that's the basis of hacking really. Getting around and accessing something you were never intended to is most definitely hacking, allot of people have a preconceived notion of what hacking is, that's why i posted the link to show people the various forms of hacking that have existed for decades originally starting with telecommunications in continuing into the data age with computers. Oh in steve wozniak was a phreaker.    Exactly, i used to date a british chick, when she moved back to London we tried to keep it going. Even today international long distance calls are a bitch when it comes to the rates, i don't know if they changed it but if you did not have a plan that included it they would charge a dollar per minute in we would spend hours on the phone.    Using nothing more then sound these guys could hack long distance calls, which in the 70's/80's was a huge thing, it would be the equivalent of unlimited minutes/texting back in the early 2,000's without paying a goddamn cent.    The most well known hackers include Steve Wozniak, co-founder of apple, john draper or better known as captain crunch the man who inspired Wozniak and Steve jobs to start up a black market business. here's an article on some of the greatest early hackers including a blind guy with perfect note recognition, might as well consider him the daredevil of phreaking.  http://motherboard.vice.com/read/twilight-of-the-phreaks-the-fates-of-the-10-best-early-hackers      It's kind of funny that some people don't consider this hacking, you should look up the early day's of hacking going back to the 70's when people would use stuff like https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phreaking  using nothing more then sound these guys could hack long distance calls, which in the 70's/80's was a huge thing, it would be the equivalent of unlimited minutes/texting back in the early 2,000's without paying a goddamn cent. Man hacking goes way back, we think of it as computers and crazy tech geeks deciphering some computer code in then using it to rob people's data from a bogus ip address listed in the Caribbean but it is so much more.   Isn't that the definition of hacking? bypassing preinstalled software,programs and other security measures to do something that the developers had never intended?   Iranian. Let me become a mod on that subreddit puleasse:)      Number one, i'm a Zionist and we're not oppressing anybody. How do i know this? because i actually do research. My information is not based on fb post and twitter messages with a picture of a kid blown in two that is later discovered to actually be a syrian. I can go into the fact that 20% of israel is arab, a third of the israeli government is made up of arab israeli political parties, a supreme court justice is arab and the various things that israel does for Palestinian arabs like you know make sure they don't starve to death by providing truck load of food to Gaza, allowing the wife of abbas in for medical treatment or the granddaughter of the pm of hamas but i'm not because you would not even listen.  You don't know any facts about the situation, if i told you west bank and gazan's were obese fat assholes who place in the top ten most obese people in the world you would not believe me, if i told you president abbas of the pa authority has a hundred million net-worth and the leader of hamas is a billionaire who lives in opulence in qatar now turkey you would never believe me. Because you don't think you don't research. I do. I had a Palestinian teacher in highschool who gave me the same crap about oppression and planes versus rocks then guess what? i read a book. I read a book about american history in i learned history is not one sided, i learned about the messed and utter bullshit we did that our history book's omit in i learned to read between the lines in do my own research.  That's how i learned that the palestenians aka arabs suffer because of their own stupidity, that's how i learned why israel is blockading gaza and why the world seems so content to allow the new "nazi's" aka israel do this in guess what it's not because the jews control congress (but it's cute that the entire pal narrative relies on blood libel to convince the always anti-semitic euro's to hate the jews even more) it's because israel is a secular democracy, it's because israel is the only country in a region full of arab nation's that provides more rights to Arabs then even arab countries provide to their own citizens in sometimes this is to the detriment of the jewish israeli's especially when one pal arab who got a free college degree while in prison for stabbing a jewish kid gets out in becomes a bomb maker for hamas or coordinates more "resistance" attacks by targeting kindergartens.   Fun fact look up how many Palestinian leaders (like those who founded bds) studied free of charge in israeli universities, how many got degrees even after being convicted of terror charges and look what they did with it. They immediately go in yell death to israel, when you say palestine what you're referring to is the british mandate that ended in 47-48 with the full recognition by the un of israeli independence and the creation of jordan/israel the results of the former mandate, the arab state of palestine never came to be because the arabs refused.  But you won't read this because you think that a made for tv media propaganda campaign devised by the arab world to help affiliate the destruction of the jewish statehood(theirs a reason why they wave flags declaring all of "palestine" over israel) you're the sap. Btw you're correct isis exist because we invaded, kicked out saddam and disbanded the majority sunni iraqi army, our bad, were sorry next time we should leave a brutal dictatorship in place, that's the messed up part about the region, their so f-ed up their only reasonable leadership is theocracy,dictatorship or terrorist groups.   Yeah this is bullshit.   Read bro, just read. Look up some of catherine the greats exploits, she was a classic hoe who use it to her advantage to court favor repeatedly. Or go to /r/history in ask about it. Kim kardashian became famous for a sextape actually, Marilyn monroe was a notorious hoe and she was still famous, you objectively stated sluts would not be put on a pedestal yet they were. This woman also had repeated affairs(op states this check his comment history) you really that naive to believe she is not sucking a dick here and there, bro we all see beautiful women, but here's the reality, what is your type may not be my type, i can believe a celeb getting preferential treatment, but if we're basing this off looks only that's bullshit. Yes pretty women, pretty people in general are treated differently, that's just life, but you really believe in most instances theirs a woman beautiful enough that she can away with half the shit op states?  I believe op but only if she is charismatic, beautiful and a local celeb that make's sense but if you're arguing from oh she's pretty she can get anything is bull because not all men have the same outlook on beauty, i have seen women that i have found stunning get looks by 90% of men but theirs always one guy who is oblivious that's just factual otherwise porn would not be so varied, different taste for different people. Also men we're bloody dense son's of bitches, not every guy would even get the hint of flirting in actuality.  Btw if op's mom is a blond i would kick her out of bed because i don't like blonds see how that works. In also that's a club/restaurant all guys are trying to get pussy in that instance, you think all dudes 24/7 are even noticing her? that's just ignorance. Yeah a guy will blow a couple of bills in a club to get a number or 3 well hopefully, but you really think he's going to do it constantly for the same chick when he knows he is not getting anything? puhlease.   Same concept applies. People put sluts on pedestals all the time, just look at kim kardashian,Marilyn monroe, they're plenty of recent and historical sluts we have turned into american icons.   	37

When leaving behind religion and embracing doubt, embracing science we still don't have the kind of freedom neitzsche had in mind. This is because we doubt ourselves in the same way that we now doubt the religion we discarded, we need to consult science before making a decision as if it's the boss.  You are the fucking boss.

             Velvetine - The Great Divide (Seven Lions Remix): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMmuxolcE6E  I have yet to hear a Seven Lions remix that I don't like better than the original!   Hi!  I'm a Master's student studying marine mammals so hopefully I can help you out a bit.  The first thing I would say is to figure out generally what you are interested in by reading as many papers as possible.   My senior year of undergrad I had no idea what I was interested in (other than doing SOMETHING with marine mammals) and going through the literature helped me narrow it down to a few different research interests.  You're going to be thinking about one project 24/7 for years so you need to make sure you like it (or at least not want to pull all your hair out over it)!  As you're going along and reading papers on topics you think are neat, you'll probably notice the same authors showing up again and again.  You should look up the CVs of these researchers and see where they are/if they take on graduate students.  To be honest, people will not care which grad school you went to - they will care about who you know and who you've worked with.  Marine mammals is such a competitive field and 90-100% of your success in it will come through your ability to network.  So, once you have a list of potential advisors, email them!  Ask what they are looking for in a student and tell them what you bring to the table (and it sounds like you have a lot to offer with the amount of research experience you have!).  If they have room in their lab for a new student, be sure to set up an interview either in person (preferably) or over Skype to talk about their university, ideas for projects, etc. while getting a feel for their personality.  You and your advisor are going to be working long, stressful hours together, so you need to make sure you are compatible and/or functional together.   I ended up finding a PI who studies something that I think is absolutely fascinating (diving physiology), who has a fantastic network already, and that I get along well with, and although we're not at a "top-tier" university, I feel like the implications of the research I'm doing and the opportunities I've gotten through my advisor's connections are going to surpass any advantage I'd have had I just gone to a well-known marine biology program for the sake of getting a degree from a big name school.  I hope this helps and feel free to PM me if you have any more questions!  Good luck :)   It did, thanks for asking!  Ended up going with a place on my own, which I think was the right choice   Hey, I graduated from OSU this past spring with a BS in E E and am now in a Marine Bio Master's program!  My advice on where to start is to find and read recent papers on topics that interest you.  This will give you an idea of what you are really interested in and could get passionate about (remember, you're going to be thinking about a single topic 24/7 for at least the next 2 years while doing your thesis, so you need to be sure you like it).  Then you should look up the authors of papers that caught your attention and contact people than you could see yourself working with.  It's much more important to have an advisor you feel you can be successful with than to go to a renowned Marine Bio program.  Also, don't get discouraged by rejection!  I emailed between 30 and 40 professors, got a reply from maybe 10, and only interviewed with 3.  Lucky for me, one of those 3 was my top choice for an advisor.   If you have any other questions or would just like to talk more about this more, feel free to PM me.  Go Bucks!   Hey, I'm a graduate student currently studying diving physiology in marine mammals!  My lab considers penguins "honorary mammals" since they are the only birds that perform these deep dives.  The dogma in marine mammal physiology for the last 70+ years was that marine mammals simply cannot get the bends, or decompression sickness (DCS) - that they must have adaptations that made it impossible, such as their ability to collapse their lungs, slow their heart rate, quickly ventilate, stop blood from going to their lungs, etc.  HOWEVER, in the past 10 years or so, the people I am working with have found evidence that it is in fact possible!  So, although the exact cause of "the bends" or decompression DCS is not known, there is (in my opinion) overwhelming evidence that nitrogen bubbles forming in the blood and body tissues are the culprit, or at least involved in the process.  As these animals dive, the air (oxygen, carbon dioxde, nitrogen) in their lungs is dissolved in the blood.  Nitrogen is an inert gas, meaning animals do not use it for metabolic processes.  Therefore, as it moves through the bloodstream and into the tissues, it is not used up and just stays there.  As the animals dive deeper and deeper, more and more of the air in the lungs can diffuse into the blood (deeper water = [greater pressure = more dissolved gas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry's_law)).  When they begin to return to the surface, the pressure gets weaker, so the gas that was dissolved in the blood starts to come out of solution and form bubbles.  Now, there is evidence that this happens on every dive (including for human divers), so why don't they get DCS every single time they do it?!?  Most of the time, the bubbles are considered "silent bubbles" which cause absolutely no damage.  These bubbles are small and the animal is able to move them back to the lungs, then remove them when they ventilate at the surface.  Too many bubbles in the bloodstream can lead to blood hemorrhaging in organs and burst blood vessels (which is what we have found in stranded/bycatch marine mammals).  What makes DCS tricky is that we haven't been able to quantify how many bubbles are" too many" bubbles in marine mammals or humans, as it seems to vary by individual.    I know of two hypotheses for what causes DCS in marine mammals, both of which have to do with naval sonar.  The first is that the sonar causes them to freak out and ascend too quickly, leading to too many bubbles for the lungs to handle.  The second is that the energy of the sonar wave causes pressure fluctuations inside the body of the animal, causing the nitrogen bubbles to more easily come out of solution.  However, there is very little data on DCS or the effects of sonar on marine mammals and we hope to be able to answer these questions in the next few years!   Hello!  I posted this in the TAMUCC subreddit, but it's much less active than this one so I figured I'd post here as well.  I'm going to be a grad student (single guy, 22 yrs old) starting at TAMUCC this fall and am in Corpus this weekend looking at apartments. I'm intrigued by the concept of places like Campus Quarters or Islander Village because I'm from another state and don't know anyone here (these places set you up with 2 or 3 roommates in furnished suites), but a majority of the reviews make them sound like hell holes. I also looked at a lot of nice 1 bedroom places on the south side, but I'm worried about becoming a hermit if I live by myself. Does anyone have any advice or suggestions?  Thanks!   Hello!

 Hes in the trees, I know it.  Hes IN the trees.  Those long sharp branches, hes tipping an entire oak to rake them along the shingles of the cabin.  Hes tracing my name as he scrapes, I can hear him scratching Thompson.   He wants to peel the roof back and open this place up like a tin of sardines.  He wants me to run.  Hes using the twigs now, tapping against the window like a child at a fish bowl.  Hello in there, he says, Im waiting.  But the cabin is safe.  He cant come in.  Thats what the ritual was all about; we were making a sacred place.  It was supposed to be filled with light, it was supposed to be refuge but we released him.  God help us, we released him.       what a vignette!   	2
 I live in Ottawa, there's perfectly made poutine all over the city.   'I should try out reddit because I need more faith in humanity.'  Don't venture into any of the default subs, else you'll lose whatever faith in humanity that remains.   I thought nothing existed outside the universe?  Which means there's an end, no?   Why did Hawking say the universe is infinite?  How can an expanding universe go on forever?   Murder is the deliberate taking of life without justification.  A Canadian can kill another person and be justified under the law in having done so.  Killing is certainly a better fit, as we do not yet know if the shooting was justified or not.   You're not responsible for unauthorized CC transactions, so no need to worry.   Ah, so in your perception of reality, no circumstance could have occurred where lethal force was justified?  Bizarre.     Murder? Based upon what?  Do you have access to all of the evidence and witness statements?  I've the distinct impression you've made up your mind, despite not having access to the totality of the evidence.   Good.  We need to win this election and handing our opponents ammunition is unwise, when you consider how fickle undecided voters are.   Another petition, to stop an entertainer...from entertaining?  People really need to get a fucking life.   That's a short haired woman.   Where is the picture of his face?  I'm told he's been the news for unrelated hypnosis type things in the past.  The women get their faces on the net, why not him?   The NDP **will never** hold office unless they shed their socialist, big government  spending  roots.  I am a member and regular donor to the NDP and am both pleasantly surprised and thrilled at the direction our future PM is taking the party.  If you want to win, you must campaign from the centre, as you will lure both centre right and centre left undecided voters that are necessary for a win.  Do you want change or do you want more Harper?  If you want change, follow Mulcairs lead.  Edit - For my party, the fringe left ( which is in abundance on/r/Canada) does as much harm to it, as the fringe right does to Harpers brand.  I know, the truth hurts.  If I wanted to turn an undecided voter off my party, I'd sent her to /r/Canada.   ...or maybe he attacked a cop with a knife.  What do I know, I'm just an RCMP paid shill.   What are they protesting?     I've  a theory, some people like some things  and other people like different things.  	16
 Superman being pragmatic *is* plot Armour though, because superman doesn't act that way, ever. He would try to reason with his oldest friend, try to talk, try not to kill him ect. And the last time he tried to fly batman into space, he just spat kryptonite gum into supes eyes.   he's really not that powerful compared to other heroes. Green lantern, Flash, Wonder Woman, Martian Manhunter, Aquaman and a bunch of other justice league heroes could pretty reliably beat him, or come pretty close.   Nope, because if batman was really playing for keeps, he would just shoot superman with a magic, kryptonite bullet from 1000 feet away, that travels back in time and kills him whilst he was still a baby.  Comicbooks are inherently unrealistic, and Superman is *definitely* not OP, especially for the DC universe.   We did it reddit!   Batista is gay????   That was actually made before Silver Linings, had massive production delays and problems, and had no marketing push. The studio deliberately chose to bury it.

It's a problem endemic of a community that wants you to feel bad for buying AC/Call of duty, yet fetishize every annual release, and complain about every 8/10 review. These guys also don't read games blogs, they just use let's plays, Totalbiscuit and facebook for all their news, which leads to amassive amount of whining about games people  have zero knowledge of.   I actually push for it to be heretic, but that's just me. :)      That's a funny way to spell Nui.   'sigh' i remember the good old days of /r/killlakill having massive arguments over whether mako was Ryuko or Gamagooris love interest.   Borderlands 2 basically expects you to do most of the side missions, so do those before you do the 'main story' in each area, other than that, just remember to use ironsights to kill most enemies and you should be golden.   Shotguns and pistols are generally the best for people who suck at aiming, a couple of them, particularly torgue and jakobs brand, tend to instakill enemies.   We know it's in development, but since the budget will be made up if networks buy in, we have no idea if it will see the light of day, and in what state (will it be for kids?)   Nope. The majority of users of /r/movies really don't know enough about film to make that judgement. It would have almost exactly the same problems as oscar voting.   They did that. It led to This: (http://robotwars.wikia.com/wiki/Storm_2/Controversy) happening.   Technically, some fighting games like Blazblue do need to be be at 30 fps or less due to a lot of mechanics being based around that framerate, like Invincibility frames and stuff.   TWEWY, kingdom hearts, and smash bros brawl are all written by the same writer.   Not quite. She also banned dissenting opinion from the forums, and to get on the forums you have to have backed the game on KS, which led to a pretty large exodus for the MN9 community. When you've basically paid to have a say on the matter, the last thing you want is forum drama.   Not really, but this will just devolve into my (British) anecdotal evidence vs yours, so I don't really see the point arguing over it.   Woah! Saint Anita attacked flight of the conchords? Guess I'm moving over to KIA.   Manga have a different format to 'comics' though, and the sales for batman don't count TP sales.   Well, he's doing the rounds on british comedies. He's still got it.   Literally every time that movie is brought up people say its terrible, but with one good sketch. But that sketch is different every time. It's shrodingers terrible movie.   It gets reccomended a lot here but spec ops the line deals with this as a major theme. Metal gear solid, particularly 2 and 3 also deal with it. but that game is somewhat controversial here.   Whiplash is kind of tenuously about masculinity. It's more about the need to drive someone towards obsession to succeed.   Yeah, Marvel can see the writing on the wall. All but one of those comics is being made into film or television, and it's allowing creators and artists to make the best content possible, and take chances on well loved cult characters like moon knight and squirrel girl. They've realized that merchandise and film is frankly, more profitable than comics and acted accordingly.   Barbara Gordon in general is kind of a continuity nightmare. Designed for batman TV, brought back to be fridged by Alan Moore, then revamped for her longest incarnation in suicide squad.  It baffles me why they brought her back when her most notable tenure as batgirl was in cartoons.   Well, the other motive was to incorporate Wildstorm characters into DC, reboot a bunch of characters, and give publicity to DC. But the end result was a lot of stuff I rather enjoyed reading about, like batgirl, oracke, and secret six, was removed.   Yeah, as somebody who mostly knows about comics through wikis and TP's, nu52 seemed to remove a lot of the stuff I found cool in the DC universe.   Eh, the thing is, spider girl is Peter parkers daughter from the future, and a legacy character, She-Hulk and spider woman HAD to be called that for legal reasons, and batwoman is called that for marketing reasons, and is actually fairly seperate from the bat family.   If you're interested in that, check out the new spider gwen comic too. It's a really neat character that should give you some spider man lore too. To be honest, the current best way to get into comics is to read a lot of enclopedias, history books, comicvine, wikipedia and tv tropes, at least, that's how I did it.   Hey, at least comics are mainstream now, Anime is still way off from that,and it looks like tabletop games will never be.   Yeah, one can definitely make some valid criticisms of female thor, particularly as she's sort of a secondary character in the book now. The reason she's not a spin-off character is likely to draw more publicity and sales to Thor, although, ironically, it looks like the upcoming spider gwen will be a much bigger deal.   It wasn't just a rumor: He was Sony's top pick in those leaked E-mails.   I've never heard that either, I mean, the ultimate spider woman was gay, maybe that's where it's from?   Even though I do like Miles Morales, I can't deny that having Peter Parker interact with Tony Stark or Steve Rogers on screen has a certain romance.    I kind of disagree that DC has been progressive lately. The new 52 and other stuff slightly before it got rid of a lot of diversity in comics, particularly related to the bat-family and stuff. IMO, this was because DC took a while to realize that modern comics are essentially speculator scripts for films and TV, and should only really worry about influencer media.   Although there is quite a bit of speculation that the next MGS game will be about the boss.   Not to mention injustice: Gods among us. That wonder woman model was horribly proportioned.   There's also the fact that Anime is popular amongst several American directors, notably Tarantino and Spielberg (with Nolan and Aranofsky liberally borrowing ideas). With Tarantino moving out of movies soon, I wouldn't put it past him to try and get more 2D animation in circulation.   You're forgetting Beowolf.      You think that's impressive, check out dwarf fortress, made by one guy who makes Molyneux like promises, and over the course of 20 years, intends to meet every. single. one.    I'm gonna start this post with a bit of a brag, but well...   I beat manus first time. Without getting the other lord souls first  Now, I know what you're thinking, another smug post where a guy talks about his L33t skills or whatever, but the way I beat Manus wasn't really through any sort of trickery of OP weaponry or anything. I just used the 15 free full health potions given to me in the room before, that is, humanity. Because Manus isn't the most high damage, aggressive boss, (at least, compared to say, Artorias or the chuckle brothers) I basically beat him through shear perseverance and the health regen of those sweet humanities. My question is why this tactic isn't considered for noobs having a tough time compared to, say, shooting arrows through the boss door? I mean, why is just gobbling up that humanity the average player has mostly collecting dust not considered? Why is this cheesy tactic considered lower on the priority list than every other cheesy tactic?   I actually liked Dr who until they added unnecessary sci-fi elements to a show about a policeman walking through the fog hearing a strange noise.   Apparently according to early reviews they've replaced all the bad writing with actually pretty decent writing! Weird huh?   You may be thinking of I wanna be the guy, which is the hardest popular platformer ever made, but wasn't made by a comedian. You may also be thinking of Poles adventure, which was a wii VC platformer with a lot of jokes.   Sega actually released a console like this. it didn't go very well.   And platinum games/ retro studios/ EAD Tokyo   Takeshi's challenge is an anti-gamer game, created by a guy who hates video games to annoy people who like them. Although Takeshis challenge is actually kind of brilliant.   Says you! My link was always faithful to the item shop girl!   I really wouldn't put it past GG to attack her for being Trans, too.   I think your problem here is that you're trying to imply that Lara dying in such a way is out of the ordinary for third person action games, when it's more or less business as usual. (just look at a lot of the death videos on the sidebar of the video) Whilst the whole thing of showing those deaths making you want to 'protect' Lara can be criticised, gory deaths are basically a tomb raider staple. If you wanna check out a really bad sexualised death in a game, check out Heavy rain, where the female lead is strapped up, and the player can choose to *let her get power drilled through the vagina*   I was gonna say getting a drill shoved up your vagina in heavy rain, but then I realized you get your dick cut off and eaten in Outlast and P.T   Voyeuristic deaths are mainly a carryover from resident evil 4, which started a massive number of third-person shooter trends, so Tomb raider isn't exactly unique in this regard. Curiously, in the original tomb raider, there were apparently dev competitions to find the most violent, OTT deaths for Lara.   You die in a LOT of phallic ways in several videogames, particularly in a lot of survival horror. The tomb raider reboot is relatively tame, aside from the skydiving death, which is pretty gory.   You could say his wit is *grossly incandescent* huh? Huh? Aw....   Exactly how many doritos were consumed at this party? If it's 50+ you, and your family, could be in serious dew-danger.    Check out 'the disaster artist' if you haven't already. The Room took 6 million dollars to make, and the book explains where that money went.   It's always depressing to see the little quirky bits on the end of trailers for cancelled projects.    I wouldn't call wonderful 101 more niche than Madworld or Anarchy reigns.   Yep.   We're waiting for confirmation, but a LOT of UI elements in the early trailers were showing multiplayer components.   Molyneux is well aware of his capacity to overpromise, which makes it all the more baffling when he does it again.   It's right there on Jims Patreon, as well as TB always talking about him/giving him youtube comments.   Yeah, after seeing this I was surprised it wasn't already posted. What happened in the last thread?   [This] (https://twitter.com/SimonHoneydew/status/559688739107405824)  was the tweet that offended TB so   The developer came to them when they were still making videos in their bedrooms, and the dev made some fairly awful decisions. (like giving a years salary to a guy who genuinely did basically run off with it) The yogs actually lost a tonne of money from the deal (100K+)   Yeah, the yogscast is probably the second biggest fish in Polaris after pewdiepie, so they hold enough power to do what they want. However, figures like Angry Joe and Jim Sterling can't do to much, as TB's one of their biggest supporters (and TB gives Jim a tonne of Patreon money)   Yeah, Lewis was talking about that in his reddit post.   All Simon did was make a disparaging remark, he wasn't asking for an attack or making some kind of political statement.   To be fair, as a fan of the yogscast, It's been a long time coming. Tb attacked both over the yogventures debacle and the yogdiscovery programme (a method of paid promotion), the criticism caused Lewis Brindley, the 'head' of the yogscast, to make a very disparaging reddit post about TB's apparent hypocrisy. TB has been *very* effectively burning bridges lately.      Yeah, if you have the money, you might as well get a console if bloodborne is good, PS+ is a really excellent service, too.   Oh... I guess I'll just go back to paying bayonetta 2 and waiting for bloodborne :(   **You better be** unless you're on a console other than PS3, in which case I have no way to attack you, and you can just go along merrily on your way.   I don't know who you are, or where your world is,but my first playthrough of the game has given me a very special set of skills. I will track your world down, I will find you, and I **will invade you**   Well, American animations such as Simpsons, south park, Futurama and Family Guy have had queer relationships pretty much since their inceptions, and you also have a fair amount of stuff in weirder kids cartoons, that can arguably been seen as as explicit. (Ren and Stimpy and stuff) And technically, batman TAS introduced a gay character (Renee Montoya) and had a lesbian relationship (which was later confirmed in comics) in the poison ivy/ Harley Quinn thing.   You're thinking of battlefront 3, which was made by the creators of timesplitters, was almost finished, and then got cancelled because lucasarts was run by morons at the time.   You're never going to have a truly meritocratic awards show about a subjective art medium, the best hope is to acknowledge as many films deserving of awards as possible. Sure, a Japanese anime will never win best picture, but at least it can get acknowledged in some format, hence why people want a 'best stunts' category, the best action film of the year will never win anything otherwise.   Oh, thanks to TB, there's still people who care about ethics (they don't like Sarkeesian and think Gone Home has too high a metacritic average) and decide to re-post all the stuff bashing strawman 'SJW's onto my facebook wall.   I believe it's something to do with YT comments pushing 'controversial' comments with lots of replies  to the top.   I'm not really such a fan of that scene. I feel that the premise of ten martial arts masters fighting one Kung fu grandmaster is lost in order to show how badass ip-man is, and it lacks directorial flair (why is the last guy just another mook? he's on his own after seeing ip man beat everyone else, surely he would react differently?)   Not much money for CG on a 4.5 million budget.   That's a disservice to the animated medium. The clone wars show was completely independent of Episode 3, and George noticeably changed grievous representation from the cartoon. It also had far *far* superior direction and fight sequences to episode 3. (the attack on Coruscant is better than everything in episode 3) f George Lucas actually was influenced by Anime, he would have probably used more camera angles than two for every dialogue scene.   My tactic was to poison fog them all and then do other stuff. It's not the most efficient way, but it's super satisfying to see your soul count gradually rise and that damage stack up.   Yeah, yep, the catacombs area was designed for a suicide run/false path. Hence why the zweihander and binoculars are there.    He got an award at the game awards no? TB has a large following in the 'games media' community, the people who visits games websites and stuff. He's not important to the world, or gaming as a whole, or even 'hardcore' but he is important to the people who frequent games media, like me.   Exactly. Games developers are, as far as I'm aware, all pretty liberal, and almost every game other than really obviously sexist stuff (like duke nukem forever) usually have issues of 'sexism' that are debatable. ("that's optional, that's a playable character ect) Which is why I find praise of good imagery preferable to critiques of supposedly bad imagery. I don't doubt the industry should improve artistically, I just doubt FF's videos explaining in a sentence why dozens of games are sexist are the best way to do so, and tend to trigger incediary reactions from people who are fairly moderate.   Or that developers are just *lazy*. I think most examples of the damsel in distress trope portrayed in games is due to not wanting to bother making a story, and using basic stereotypes (I.E Arthurian romance) to create a situation that universally translates, such as the princess is locked in a castle etc.   Casual is used as a pseudonym of 'Game I don't like' or 'Game that's not very good'. Which is the same isolationist, fatalistic approach to games that keeps companies making poor quality games, because the people who play super-creative, well made games are discouraged from talking about them to 'casual' relatives.   Although it's still noticeably better than the cesspit that is Dota 2.  	104
 What? Shrek 2 was great. Really funny movie.   Its gonna be good...     	3
 I'm talking about the lack any pro Hillary headlines in /r/politics. Wouldn't there have to be some if, per your narrative, if it was a pro-Hillary circlejerk?    A search of "Hilary" in /r/politics is showing the newest posts to be things like:   Martin OMalley Criticizes Hillary Clinton for Flip-Flopping   Hillary Clinton Said to Hire Former Wall Street Cop as Campaign CFO   Hillary Clinton's presidential announcement video is creepy    Gutfeld: Hillary's Campaign Rollout More Staged Than 'My Fair Lady'   How John Roberts Made Hillary Clinton President   Hillary Clinton campaign to accept lobbyist donations   Doesn't seem  like /r/politics is trying to justify Hillary at all.   Did you know that income taxes paid by individuals account for only 46 percent of all federal tax revenue?   Hillary wants outlaw abortions and gay marriage and repeal Obamacare?        Wasn't he supposed to be dead or in jail two years ago?   Oh Look, yet another minority politician that Glenn Beck wouldn't vote for.   541,000 more people having money taken from their weekly paychecks and put into the Social Security Trust Fund.    Anyone want to name the achievements of any other person currently running for POTUS?    Shes more Like LBJ, but shorter, and with less penis, more balls.   We're gonna in up puttin' Nancy Reagan on the Twenty, I just know it.   It's been two year since Ted Nugent was supposed to be dead or in jail if Obama was reelected, so we at least know that making a prediction like that one or calling the President a subhuman mongrel, doesn't fit the criteria for who gets on the kill list.   Liberty University students "were mandated" to attend Sen. Ted Cruzs presidential announcement "or they would be fined."  http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2015/mar/25/jess-mcintosh/liberty-u-students-faced-fine-if-they-skipped-cruz/   Jeez, from the headline, I was expecting a link to XHamster.            Meanwhile property taxes in Alabama are like 0.33%.            OP didn't write the headline or the article, OP just posted on Reddit.    These kids are probably on some pedos radar by now, and no good will come of that either.   This was probably true in 1858 as well.    Remember when this article was about the Right pissing all over themselves  because Obama decided to negotiate with Tehran?  OP remembers.          I wouldn't be surprised. I live in a neighborhood with alot of hispanics and I've noticed one thing, no single parents.     I propose that we use his full birth-name, Rafael Eduardo Cruz, every time he is referred to from now on. You know, like in '08 whenever conservatives mentioned Obama, they said "Barack Hussein Obama".   I suppose the correct response would have been to issue a letter of marque and reprisal.   Saying that someone would be an excellent office holder if elected and saying that you endorse that candidate for that office is two different things.    I feel like we need another Truman or LBJ, so Hillary Clinton.   The threat of incarceration even though it's a non violent offence?   What President wouldn't say their former Secretary of State would be "excellent president"? It would be news worthy if he had said he didn't really think she was up to the job or something.     Would not paying the ticket count as a "nonviolent crime", would they get another ticket for that?   Nonpayment of child support is a victimless crime?   Ten lines in "The government ought to leave non-violent offenders alone," said Paul. "If a guy is selling loose cigarettes and not paying the king's ransom in taxes, couldn't we give him a ticket instead of throwing him to the pavement?  Maybe you should read more than the first paragraph. This about more than drugs, he even mentions people being jailed for nonpayment of court ordered child support.   And selling untaxed cigarettes and not paying court costs and not paying student loans.   And what do we do if he doesn't pay the ticket worth billions? Write him one for trillions? That'll teach 'em.   "Even with child support, its a good example of how unintended consequences come about," Paul said.  Clearly he is talking about more than just drugs here.   Literally.    Look up Chain of Fools and Run Through the Jungle.   Y'all realize that the Banksters and corrupt politicians count as "non-violent offenders", right?         That one is sheer masterpiece of the form and fortunately it's can be found in high quality, making it a great one to introduce someone who might like horror or Sci-fi, but has never listened to OTR.    On the other hand, if the big timber companies had a big lay-off, it would cost a lot in unemployment checks, but only until they ran out. Sometimes protectionist policies cost us more in the long run than they save us in the short term.   Love Gunsmoke, it's my favorite otr show. Thought you were pulling my leg because I recently heard this episode and the first minute or two didn't sound any different, then when Miss Kitty came in, it all went to hell. Also love the new look. Great Job!   Ron Paul fared much worse in the Republican primaries among old voters, who are the GOP base.      Nixon didn't hold an elected office after losing to Kennedy in 60, until he was elected President in 68.   Because Fu Manchu is immortal!              Iran? Lying? Unfathomable.   Wouldn't want to be mistaken for anything else.   So Breitbart is endorsing Bill for First Gent?    So Aztecs or Satanist should still be able to practice Human sacrifice, right? or Christians should be able to deny service to blacks because they believe they bear the Mark of Cain? Muslim fathers should be able to kill their daughter if she is raped?    According to this, Mitt Romney still has a better shot than Elizabeth Warren?   I guess he figures that if all americans went to a tent revivals, found Jesus and became an evangelicals, we could just have a theocracy and wouldn't need a separation of church and state?      This woman has never even so much as served on a local school board or a city council, but thinks she is qualified to be leader of the free world?   With 150 bodies, 600 body parts would be 4 body parts per person.   So is the NYPost admitting that Google dictates what they print or admitting that they aren't news?   So you're asking how you can get deeper into an echo chamber   not have your ideological beliefs challenged by an outside narrative?   Ted Cruz may be trailing in something that kinda, sorta matters, but hes winning big in something that means jack-squat.   And he can tell his many pen-pals your address.    And it's not like they were even complicated bass lines.      People with "White collar jobs" don't usually get "welfare, Food Stamps and free health care".    Double plus bad for Winston, it's Room 101 for him for not throwing that clip down the memory hole.      I don't support the Death Penalty, but there is no way that being shot in the head, at close range by a professional marksman is less humane than being a guinea pig.      Funny how there is no mention of how many of them are murderers or rapist, like percentages, just that some of them are. You could be considered a criminal alien just for speeding or driving without a licence.            You're paying your own way and not receiving a handout?    Several candidates are claiming that they'll dismantle Obamacare on day one if elected, for purely ideological reasons, despite the fact that it's lowering the deficit. I would call that relevant.      If what you say is true, then no one at WND, Townhall or American Thinker is a Conservative.         Jeff Beck does use anything but his thumb.     From the actual poll  For each of the following pairs of statements, tell me which one better describes your perfect candidate, even if neither is exactly right.   The candidate shares your views on all major issues 51%  The candidate may not share all of your views on major issues, but belongs to the party you prefer and has a good chance of winning 47%  No opinion 3%    And there we have it Ladies and Gentlemen, proof that the GOP really is racist.      Thus whites aren't at any significant threat from blacks who mostly live in different neighbourhoods and mostly self victimize one another?    Which raises the question, why do you care what the percentage of crimes committed by blacks are, if it's mostly black on black crime?  Are you a black Democrat?     Betteridge's law of headlines is an adage that states: "Any headline that ends in a question mark can be answered by the word no."  The reason why journalists use that style of headline is that they know the story is probably bullshit, and dont actually have the sources and facts to back it up, but still want to run it.   Betteridge's law of headlines is an adage that states: "Any headline that ends in a question mark can be answered by the word no."  The reason why journalists use that style of headline is that they know the story is probably bullshit, and dont actually have the sources and facts to back it up, but still want to run it.   And most of their victims are of what race? You seem to have left that part out.   **FACT:** Most murders are committed by right-handed people!  **DOES THAT INFORMATION IN AND OF ITSELF MEAN A DAMNED THING?:** No.     John Byrne pencils, which is why they look like Superman and Lois, other than that, I don't know.     And then post about it.   Bill Pullman didn't know either.      I would like to see more citizens voting, because they care and are well informed. I not sure compulsory voting wouldn't be much different than having 15-20% of the votes cast by a Magic 8-ball.    R. Lee Ermey hardly blinks at all IRL.    Trump is watching you.   Be that as it may, they still choose who represents us in Washington, at least the ones who bother to vote.   The average american assumes that if they aren't smuggling illegal drugs, supporting terrorist or downloading child-porn, that nothing will ever come of it.    Most "Americans" don't descend from the Pilgrims either.    Still doesn't explain why he would call a Buick a "Magnum".   Bentley's lawyers said marriage is a natural reality and that same-sex marriage destroys the "rights of children to be connected to their biological parents."  What about adoption or divorce?            Kim Jong Un didn't get any money from The Interview either.   Why was there an American meat crisis in 1910?   That's only a 18 year span, from the time LBJ died till Nixon did was a 21 year span.   And Ben Carson's First One as well!       RINGO!   The ending of Born in the U.S.A.        "The 'wisdom of the crowds' is the most ridiculous statement I've heard in my life. Crowds are dumb. It takes people to move crowds in the right direction, crowds by themselves just stand around and mutter."  "I don't care what anyone says, the masses are morons. My own grandmother is an idiot. You can't count on them to pick good stuff. Just check out Network TV to see what the masses want for entertainment. There's certainly a place for that kind of thing but it's not on Fark. Now go away and let me finish taking a crap!"      Could some of you right-wingers ELI5, how NOT having a deal with Iran will somehow stop them from developing a bomb?      Do you want to be PM'd Dickpics?   Cause this is how you get PM'd Dickpics.   But the average age of Republicans is now approaching 50, so in 20 or 30 years this might mean something.   Not since the freed slaves took all their jobs.   Who said that? Rush Limbaugh or Glenn Beck?   But this is one of the other 22 times.            Former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani, cleaned up Times Square. Why? Because he hated New York.            Buenos Aires, Falafel, Fuckin' thing sucks, do it live.   And that's with Facebook, Reddit, Skyrim and GTA 5. Think about how bad we were back in the 80's when most of us first got cable and VCR's for the first time.   Giuliani had 'Mafia' influences at an early age   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudy_Giuliani#Early_life  Still true.   The left makes a movie about the Assassination of George Bush.  Death of a President is a British film    Does the 2 amendment cover machetes?   So when does Obama get to address the Knesset?      The Coffin Handbills used by supporters of John Quincy Adams against Andrew Jackson in the 1828 presidential campaign. Jackson's mother was called a prostitute, and his wife an adulteress.   California loves Lesbians.   Hope, sweetheart, Sassy can't breathe.   Peace through Strength is not a foreign policy and does not stop terrorism.  Terrorism isn't the only or even the chief reason for a policy of "Peace through Strength". The Partitions of Poland wouldn't have happened if the Liberum veto had not made a stronger military response impossible. Transparency could keep wasteful spending in check.  Side supply or Trickle Down Economics does not make a strong economy.  Pretty much agree.       Or heard of Pompeii.   Even I, a left-wing circlejerker, agree.   But he's still down with pot   gold, right?   So a minority of rich people tried to take over a country and install communism?     "If by Sweet, Rich ejaculate  you mean another 59 months of continuous job growth and falling unemployment, then yes Sweet, Rich ejaculate ".   Just months after showing support for mandatory quarantines?          Some of the new measures taking effect will include mandatory job training and minimum weekly work hour requirements, both despised enemies of lazy government leeches.  So let me get this straight, the assumption here is that if they are required to work in order to continue receiving welfare, that these people will not continue to receive welfare and will instead go out and get a job so that they will not have to get a job in order to continue receiving welfare benefits?      Back in the days when they still marketed cigarettes?   Some were never seeing a doctor before Obamacare.   I think they decided they didn't want to be crucified upon a cross of gold back in 1896.   I don't know anything about this video, but Ted Gunderson has been dead for four years.   Guy, second from the top left, isn't praying, he is thinking.   St.Peter dontcha call me cuz' I can't go,   I owe my soul to the company store.   Wonder why there is no mention of the towns population (2,786) in this article and why would it cost a town that size "$350,000 a year" to have a police force?   Why aren't there any guns where you live?   By all means, feel free to go looking for more freedom and prosperity somewhere else and let us know how that works out for you.    Deleting Leaks, that's not how this works. That's not how any of this works.   Conservatives are like  "Ha, Ha, Hilary could lose again!"  "Oh Fuck, Warren could Win!?!?"      So when it comes to mandatory vaccination for contagious diseases and openly carrying loaded firearms in supermarkets, we need to get government out of our lives, but when it comes to who we marry and what we wear, we need more government in our lives?      You'd have to get remarried if you move to a different state, if not, then it wouldn't stop gay marriage because gays would just go to another state to get married and come right back, thus nullifying any state law against gay marriages.      "America, Love it or Leave it" - Archie Bunker 1974   So it was really Democratic President Lyndon Baines Johnson, who was opposed to the Civil Rights Act and Republicans that shoved it down his throat? Funny, I remembered it differently.          http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Cronkite#Vietnam_War   If he died before age 30, he may never have had a SS#   Guy on the right work there too. Same hat, same tools in his pockets.   Think like Henry Ford, it close to the carburetor, less fuel line.       But a [Clash of Civilizations](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clash_of_Civilizations) doesn't require anyone to be a Bararian.    You've been here a year clicking links and reading comments, but never posting? Do you work for the Government?   I don't remember the Democrats calling for mandatory euthanasia of the mentally handicapped. Was that before or after the GOP called for drug testing them?      So, not a Socialist?    "Record Breaking Economic isn't good enough!         The problem is that in order to get people as diverse as Stalin and Churchill to cooperate, you need a Hitler.     Which proves he isn't shaping public option or defining the narrative and hasn't been for sometime now.    It proves that most people don't get their information from the "Mainstream Media" anymore. That broadcast networks no longer have the ability to shape public option anymore.                 70% have four or more toolbars.   To Read the Full Story, Subscribe or Log In.  Why do the GOP want a Christian Nation like America to surrender to Radical Islam? Is it because they will stop Gay Marriage   Abortion with Sharia Law?    Google Image search "profound mental disorders".   Google Image search "profound mental disorders".   One thing I noticed. At no point in this story do they mention when the under employed and those who have given up looking for work stopped being counted in the unemployment numbers. Where they ever counted?   Didn't say anything was wrong with it, just isn't usually done that way in the U.S. Just like the way he has his legs crossed at the knees, in the U.S. men generally lay one ankle on the other knee.   Actually I based my assumption on the way the dude on the right is holding his cigarette.     Foreign aid. Trade sanctions.   I'm guessing this is Europe.   More like over 70 years ago  In 1948, the Democratic President Harry S. Truman ordered the end of racial discrimination in the U.S. Army, proposed the creation of a permanent Fair Employment Practices Commission, supported the elimination of state poll taxes (which effectively discriminated against poor blacks and whites in voting), and supported drafting federal anti-lynching laws.  Don't they teach you kids anything in school anymore?    Remember when Bill Maher lost his nightly broadcast network TV show and had to settle for a weekly cable TV show after saying controversial things?    When someone gets a speeding ticket, they have less money to spend on pizza, so speed limits hurt the economy and kill jobs.   Guess who just admitted that lower prices would probably lead to fewer people getting a college education? The Blaze!    	199
 Hahahaha, this happened to me! Also I had a hot ultra sound nurse examine me... That was awkward.   Also going to go ahead and call some troll will respond to every out-of-sub reference with /r/FeelsLikeTheVeryFirstTime   I always knew it as just 'telephone'. Is that irony?

 How is that a twist?  That's pretty much a non-surprise for a Republican politician.   That's awesome - I keep forgetting how big Chaos Crags is, and how rawly volcanic it is, being relatively young.  And you can actually see a lot more than three volcanoes in this picture, more like ten ... including at least two calderas (Tehema and the always forgotten Yana).   Go over to /r/badhistory, they're not really happy with glorification of an ultimately overturned and replaced document that doesn't actually have any legal ramifications today.    Don't forget about the war against religious freedom!!!  It's easy to forget about something that doesn't exist.   An actual king that called himself a socialist.  [citation needed]     I'd say she probably had no relationship with her parents to speak of.  With her parents, her siblings, *reality* ...    Yet a woman who identifies as black is somehow an embarrassment to the left.  A woman who *pretended* to be black, and used that as a way to fraudulently gain benefits and position, and also very likely faked a series of supposed hate-crimes and threats against her.  There's no parallel situation, no matter how desperately you *want* it to be true.    Same birther ringer as Obama.  What does that even *mean*?   Sooo ... you didn't read the article, and have no idea what it's actually about, I see.   I've lived in Northern California my whole life, and now I'm really bothered by the fact that I've never been in a basement, and can't even think of a building I've been in that had one.   ... I went to high school in a time before cell phones or anything resembling iPods.  And the textbooks were a few years old and provided by the school to every student.    And everyone knows where everyone else's locker is and being able to 'meet up' there.  That ... uh, kind of describes my school.  Only 300 students, though, grades 7-12.  Also being conveniently able to crack open a locker and leave something inside and the other person isn't remotely freaked out by the breach of security.  We actually didn't bother with the whole "locking" thing, either.  What's the worst that could happen?  Because the answer is "nothing."   ... how is that supposed to be relevant?    You're left with a vessel that could easily kill a heavy cruiser, likely cause captains of battle cruisers to have kittens, give battleships pause for thought and not start a war.  You're left with a vessel that could easily be outrun by a heavy cruiser, would get stomped by a battlecruiser, and would thrill a battleship captain for the chance to practice some gunnery.  It was a mediocre ship built of compromises and wishful thinking.    It was a Disneyland clone that opened 6 years after the real Disneyland  He phrased it poorly - Nara Dreamland opened 20 years before the official Tokyo Disneyland.    He... isn't?  Not a credible one.  We're talking about the guy that claimed the Obama stimulus of 2009 caused the recession of 2008.    If race is a social construct,  There are genetic, ethnic, and historical elements to race.   It may have just been a reference to the scarcity of Tiger I vs. American Sherman encounters.   I have a hunch it's because there *are* elk in NE California, and it was just a mistaken name.  Then again, Thousand Lakes Wilderness only has like twelve small lakes, so who knows.  Maybe they just drew names out of a hat.    Sputnik prints stuff your corporate MSM won't touch  I just looked at the headlines for http://sputniknews.com/us/, and what do you know!  It's all a bunch of stuff heavily covered in the American mass-media.    For example, the US airforce has mishaps on a daily basis, as well as the US Navy and Marines.  The U.S. has about three times as many combat aircraft, so a higher raw number of accidents is to be expected.    The *rate*, however, of attrition of Russian aircraft should be worrying to the Russian Ministry of Defence, given how slow both their upgrade (of Soviet-era equipment) and procurement (of new aircraft) programs are right now.   Mission Accomplished.   Thank you, Devan Lochees.    It was so thrilling and if we smoked, we might have lit some cigarettes after that sequence.  Four hours later, I had to consult a doctor.    the national debt is not looking very good my friend..  Mitt, is that you?   Lassen's just a tad bit outside of Washington.    Brady might be better than Alex   ... might?   Well, duh.  It's a British ship - they'll be launching A380s.    They make a great addition to pretty much any salad or sandwich  And cold pasta.    Eagles legend Frank Gore once played for the 49ers.   I checked - all our memes seem to have retired.   A ladybug.  Everyone loves them, so I'm not going to get squashed.    most people prefer to keep their private parts private,   The problem is that a lot of women *choose* to wear day-to-day clothing where nipples are noticeable through the fabric.  I prefer to think that it's on purpose.   Hmmm.  Spoilers, obviously.  Brys Beddit dissecting Rhulad Sengar.  The Church scene from *Kingsman*.  Logan Ninefingers vs. Golden whateverhisnamewas in *Red Country*.  Mark Vorkosigan taking down Baron Ryoval.  If we include battles, pretty much every major battle written by Steve Erikson in the *Malazan Books of the Fallen*, but especially the Siege of Capustan, the Chain of Dogs, and Second Yghatan.  I'm sure I'll think of more later.   "Get drunk alone and weep bitterly."  It's not for everyone, but I'll figure it'll be popular with redditors.   Logan Ninefingers.  Either that or Karsa Orlong.   Nickleback has at least two or three good songs.  The trick is to pick out a couple you like the sound of, and never listen to any of their other songs, because they're pretty much the same.  Also, I'll admit that I like Avril Lavigne's "Complicated," simply because I like the way her voice sounds in it.  I couldn't care less about the lyrics.   Just remember ... it doesn't actually matter.   Get laid.    I am going to a flight school at UC Davis  When did UCD get a flight school?  I'm assuming it's out on the airfield west of 113.   I really expect better of Star Trek:TOS than to get Old West history wrong.    Passion of the Christ is actually incredibly accurate to the bible,  Which version?  The four Gospels are all contradictory.    I'd almost like to see that one re-made.  Michael Bay kind of did that.  Unfortunately.   I'll be happy to trash him *in* context, too.   Kyle fucking Williams.   I'm too broke to afford new books, so I just stick with the ones I've read again and again.  (The nearest used bookstore is 70 miles away, and inter-library loan isn't very effective when the other libraries in the network also have the same poor selection).    Discover that Iron Age civilizations are pretty good a farming and engineering  I can't help but think that there's plenty of mid-19th Century levels of improvements that could be applied to improve 500 BCE agricultural methods.    But I don't know shit about farming, so I can't actually name any.   The Burkes and Ticos are almost as long, almost as heavy tonnage-wise, and far more heavily armed.    Good news: Brandon sanderson is a machine, and we will get a book every two years.  We'll also get other Sanderson stuff, because writing medium sized books is how he takes a break from writing huge books.   Aircraft carriers aren't surface combatants?    you can't really eat mayo alone either.  Not with that attitude.    So Pat has several currency systems because he's into economics,  On that note, I'd really like an explanation of why Kvothe got change back from that tailor in Tarbean.  If the cost was one talent even, and Kvothe handed him a talent ... why did he get two jots back?   The most annoying part about that exchange is that Kvothe *uses the subjunctive mood* in his story telling.  He (and therefore Pat) obviously finds it useful.   The only recently notable (4.0+) earthquake in the Shasta/Lassen area was fault-caused, not volcanic.    It's just a bunch of government money funding "science" that produces the results government is looking for.  Given that the results are exactly the opposite of what the government wants to hear (we're fucking shit up, and it'll be expensive to fix), that's laughable.  And there's not much money in climate research.    In the 70s we were all supposed to freeze to death.  No, we weren't, and this is bullshit point brought up by climate deniers as some bizarre trump card that scientists aren't omniscient.  The "a new Ice Age might be coming" thing was a briefly lived theory in narrow circles that saw some popular media publication, before fading away in the face of things like *evidence* and *provable facts*.    They're war criminals,  That's the part that isn't proven.    No, *he's* an idiot - a fat fundie racist redneck.  I'm just drunk.   I'm honestly curious ... how did you figure out how to post on Reddit?  Because someone as mind-bogglingly stupid as you ... well, it's quite an achievement.  I don't want to take it away from you.    why are they here???  Why are you here?  can't they just go back to iraq :)  Because all Muslims in the U.S. are from Iraq.  It's impossible that some of them came from other countries, or were born here.  Not possible, right?   The President is black.   And I'm sure you've been saying that for a long time.   Uh, is there some reason you can't listen to it anymore?   Huh ... didn't know you were still around.   Do you want to drive Fox News out of business?   Parents will still be able to order soda for their children at no extra cost  but they will have to ask for it.  The horror!  Oh, wait, not so much.     EPA regulations are tightening and they've pretty much killed coal.  Bullshit.  Cheap NG is cutting into coal.    But Obama told us the economy was going great.   It was just a couple of months ago that Republicans in Congress were taking credit for the positive economy of late 2014.     Any troops we would have stationed there would have been assigned peacekeeping -- not frontline -- roles.  Because there's such a difference in Iraq.  Hint: There isn't.  Their presence alone would be enough to deter any major assaults.  In what fucking lunatic reality would this have been true?  Because not this one, where the presence of American troops *invited* attack.  You know, here in the *real fucking world* where we have **fourteen years** of examples of this happening on a daily basis.  Then again, that probably dates back to before you were born.  You liberals are pathetic.  I really hope you're being paid to be this stupid.    Almost none would be needed to sustain those gains.  Hey, look, something that completely ignores TEN FUCKING YEARS OF ACTUAL HISTORY.   Not feeling much sympathy here, especially since she played the race card right off the bat as an excuse for her own horrible behavior.   Nope.  And yes, that's pretty fucking uncivilized.   For how many decades?  Iraq shouldn't be propped up with American blood.   ... OK, that doesn't disprove anything.  It's still free housing, of the non-carboard box variety.    even Colorado class battleship would have fended off the Bismark with ease.  The more modern fast BBs, sure, but even the post-Pearl upgraded Colorados would've had a rough time with the Bismark.    probably   Sooo ... you're saying there's a chance.   Don't Starve.    but there is something about a physical CD that's impossible to replicate.  Oh, God, we've reached this point.    I don't get how they never decided to change tactics in that war.   Read a book on WWI.  They did, they were just limited by the technology of the time.   I found a deer while mowing the lawn.  And while walking to the store.  And while driving from Point A to Point B.  And that was just today.  They're like big rats, but they come out in the daylight.   You have trouble with reading comprehension.   Well, not wearing a hat saying "FUCK IT" for months to come.   If you're not a sociopath, *yes*.    That looks ridiculously archaic.  That just makes it more appropriate.    If we're going with that era, I'd roll with J.J. Stokes.  Eh, J.J. Stokes is pretty well known as The Guy Who Didn't Replace Jerry Rice.   Justin Smith disagrees.    Therefore those responsible for such acts must have some legitimate reason for 'acting out'   Ah, yes, all those liberals defending ISIS.  They're everywhere!   Not on the weekends.  That's when all the conservatives show up to downvote brigade.    Asked some folks where I could get some good Mexican and was recommended jimboys.  What did you do to piss them off?  Everyone in the Central Valley knows to go to a roach coach for good Mexican.   You mean like bombing the shit out of them, like we've been doing for a year?  Or heavily arming and supporting the Iraqi army, like we've been doing for twelve years?  Those things?   In an article in the National Review, Stanford academic Victor Davis Hanson  Should've known his name would pop up.    Now they're trying to persuade us that illegal immigrants don't drink water?  Residential water consumption is a small fraction of California's water usage - a few million immigrants don't have much of an impact.   Hell, I haven't even paid for MasterSplitter.    Oh, but are you saying a 6th grade child can't speak ONE VERSE!   No, I didn't.    Fucking hell, are you off your meds?  Because there are clearly medications that you should be on.  stop banning stuff.  Not teaching something in a public school as being true is not the same as banning.   Of course they can learn *about* them.  But such works shouldn't be taught as truth.    And who said anything about denying?  Anyone of any age is generally all right (barring age restrictions, like for pornography) to read whatever they want in their free time.  Saying a child can't be taught a book in school isn't the same as saying they can't read it otherwise.  And you keep bringing up book-burning, which I haven't endorsed.  Do you even know what "strawman argument" means?   I don't want to deny the world books.  Why did you even put books in quotation marks?    I want to make sure children are being taught reality, not mythology.  Reason, not faith.  They can be taught *about* belief systems, as long as that teaching is even-handed, and doesn't favor one over another, and doesn't claim that any one is true.   Do you ... do you even realize how crazy you sound?  I mean like, at all?   Oh, you're a fundie.  Sorry, I thought I was engaging in a rational debate with a sane person.      Oh, but if you would disallow a small child in 6th grade from using a certain book, isn't that book as good as burnt?   No ... no, it isn't.  Religious texts *shouldn't be used for instruction* in a public school.  That's what I'm getting at.    What other books would you disallow 6th graders from reading? Using your own criteria, couldn't "christian fundamentalists" choose 1000 books to burn on the pyre? Using your own logic of course.  ... Wow, you've got an entire *field* of strawmen that you're busy attacking.  Persecution complex much?   Who said anything burning?    What other books would you toss in the trash and not let a child learn from?  When it comes to a public school, I'd sure as hell start with the Bible.    I disagree. I could quote Galileo, and still have a captive audience.  That wouldn't be an endorsement of religion at a government function.   That's some 1980s OMNI type font, there.   There was the shootdown by the USN of Libyan planes over the Gulf of Sidra in 1981 and 1989, with a combined 4 Libyan aircraft destroyed.  Four USAF F-16s shot down four Serbian planes in 1994, during the Banja Luka Incident.  And, of course, the Gulf War: here's a list of air-to-air engagements (that resulted in a Coalition victory) during Desert Storm:  http://www.rjlee.org/air/ds-aakill/   To anyone that's watched both Arrow and Daredevil, is Arrow as good?  Because Daredevil was fucking awesome, so I'm afraid of being let down by watching Arrow.    I shouldn't, should I?  No, you shouldn't.  I watched it as it first aired, and never rewatched it.  I think LOST was worth the ride, though.  Then ending was good enough, considering how bad it *could* have been.   Praline and dick.   The aliens were actually demons, the water they were affected by was supposed to be holy water.   The really big ones tend to have a low population density but geographic   economic homogeneity, so there's no need to break them up.   A very accurate way to describe civil rights limitations.  No right is absolute, there are always conditions and limitations, as there should be.    Harkness and surrounding area are great, if you want to focus on it for a few days, not really a highlight worth additional driving if you're pressed for time.  Ah, I'm definitely not pressed for time when it comes to the Park.  I live on the road leading to Juniper, so I can make a day trip a few times a week, if I like.    terminal geyser and harkness are nothing special.  I'll second this, but only because I want to save them for myself.  They're more subtle, like Devil's Kitchen, or Jakey Lake and the whole eastern lake loop next to Caribou.  I prefer that over the touristy stuff.  	112
 Goon: You're somewhere in Australia. Or you're an Australian who is somewhere else.    Yes, Exactly my point.    eeek so inappropriate.   "Most people with pedophilic tendencies never harm a child, knowing it is wrong. These people need support and encouragement to stay strong."   Most people with pedophilic tendencies never harm a child, knowing it is wrong. These people need support and encouragement to stay strong.    Anything here. http://www.coolthings.com.au/shop_by_price_30_40.html   I agree, it's annoying that a lot of people have seen the funniest 5 minutes of his shows without sitting through the 7 minutes of real talk on the issue. I watch the show religiously and I'm not even American.    I watched the video on mute while Sigur Ros - Hoppipolla happened to be playing on random. It synced up perfectly.    Tuesdays With Morrie.   Happy birthday. Do you and your friends recite the V for Vendetta thing every year too?        WHY WOULD YOU DO THIS TO ME?   Bartender here: I would tip over annoying or condescending patron's drinks then ask them to leave because they are intoxicated.   Can confirm: Have done it.     Whatever John Oliver decides it will be.    Just to be the devil's advocate here, horses die. People die. Sometimes when they are doing sports.  Horses aren't beaten, the crop is used to communicate to the horse because it is too loud to use voice commands.  Now, is it not just a little suspicious that the favorite horse collapsed right after doing a race it's done hundreds of times before? It's worth considering that maybe this was sabotage, poison perhaps.  I'm not saying it's not worth looking into, maybe Melbourne is just too hot in November to do this.  Horse racing is not inherently cruel. Races happen every single day. Physical endeavors just get more dangerous the more elite they get.   	15
 What is going on with that dude's Adam's apple?   Hate to tell you this but this gets posted about every other day here   Paper Planes by MIA. I just have yet to meet someone who doesn't like that song no matter what they listen to   Gives me a reason to go to Walmart other than Great Value   3 years you say I'll take that into consideration   I'd be ensconced in it   Dating app called Tinder. you "swipe right" on the girls you'd like to meet, or you know, hook up with   To think someone was so excited to get this. Maybe it was a kid. Maybe it was someone's girlfriend. And now to be left as this, trash thrown out, and not even a bag was spared.   There needs to be more XL size beer glasses   You're the person I hated to fight in my judo class cuz you're hard to throw   This is pretty tempting   My friend this NYE wore a vest with a button down shirt under it with a fedora. At first I thought it was ridiculous but he actually pulled it off well. Maybe it was his lack of a neckbeard, or any beard for that matter      I know it's already been said but this was freakin awesome! You did an amazing job editing that with the video and sounds and the order of it. I'm crying right now   Yeah pretty much. Also "having" a baby with your friend is a bad idea   intra-meta   They wasted the place tagging it is what they did. If they could keep this up it's like the ultimate club house for you and your friends   Wish I had known the point before I first pressed it. Just another 59 :(   I think I got 60?    I pressed it without even thinking. Guess I'm just a sucker for peer pressure   "Plot twist: How I Met Your Father is about woman #31." from a comment there. This would actually be awesome. It could allow for a whole different dynamic, any type of show really. They could film it now so they have the final scene (since NPH would be aging throughout it) and it'd be just like HIMYM   Don't worry.. ducky tie comes back. It finds a way   The first time I watched it that day I enjoyed it. Then I watched it again an hour later with my girlfriend and didn't like it. The more I thought about it the more I didn't like it. I have to say I haven't watched any episode from Season 9 since, I've rewatched the rest of it plenty though   I'm sure at least 10. The problem is I'll watch a random one in like Season 5 then have to start at the beginning and watch all of them   This means I have to pay rent today :( and no gold to pay with   For those high sodium slices of bread   "Rice is great when you're hungry and want 2000 of something"   I was gonna say 58 of these would probably wipe out Europe   And that one movie with Seth Rogan   /r/im18andinhistory101   "Hey check out this funny cat gif"   I just picture 50 cent having a temper tantrum then running out of his grandma's house   They are 2 days from retirement   I guess it really depends on where you are going. I would say use google alot to figure out the best transportation though. You're probably going to have to take a taxi/subway/bus or whatever to get from one city to another or even just within a city   My senior prom was in the Space Needle which was awesome. As far as dancing n stuff goes though it was pretty mellow   He's probably waiting for the parachute to come out   When is Bryan Cranston finally just going to be an underwear model?   Turbotax this year had animations like a popup book. It was almost too EZ   Sites like twitter and yelp must be the best and worst thing for companies. I can't imagine getting your whole business destroyed by social media. Not that they didn't necessarily deserve it   It's also based on other things I've heard of the show. If you want to make a case for it though go ahead, I'd give a second chance   I know what you mean. All of a sudden plates are bowls and pieces of bread are plates   I actually forgot about Guardians but yeah that was a great movie. And I'm sure plenty of people on Reddit are big superhero fans but I think the masses will lose interest when there's lesser known superhero movies and too many sequels of existing ones   I've seen only about 1 episode of Friends but from what I remember it was nothing but half-attempted sex jokes. It did not seem funny at all   Yes. Although I suspect after Avengers 2 we're going to see the decline. I'm sure they were popular but I don't know too many people who watched the sequels to Capt. America, Thor, Spiderman, etc.   The difference is other out of state students probably are not paying out of their own pocket. I think everyone here would love for you to come to WSU but 100k out of undergrad would lead to a lifetime of debts and would not be worth it. WSU is fun but I'm sure the schools in Florida would be good too   Agreed. that is way more than a 40 lb difference. And looking like the left to the right in 4 months would be insane   It's a lot funnier with sound because he makes that horrible chalk screeching sound when he fixes the F   wifey girlfriend and mistress   Cuz I'm the Juggernaut biiiiitch   It's no joke. At this point I could go to McDonalds or few a couple more bucks I could go to any sit down restaurant and have a quality meal   At least they're already on a flammable surface for you   Correct!   Throwback to the skybridge nice   Yeah sorry my webcam pointed out the window isn't ideal   He's the one that isn't 21 yet   Nope guess again         My parents changed their home phone to one ring so it goes straight to voicemail. Do not know why they still bother with landlines   Put that little money into bitcoin. I can't imagine how rich I'd be now if I had done that   What's wrong with Kevin? He's nice and funny and seems like he would fit in if they didn't all hate him   Seriously. A lazy college student like me throws it all in the slow cooker then drunk me at 2 am already has chili    I found a full on skeleton costume at the thrift store so I bought it. Problem was it was meant for 10 year olds and I'm 6 ft. Still wore it though   Do you speak english motherfucker?   Ok so maybe 3-4 times is actually good for you. After that though   It's weird how perfectly flat the bottom of that is but every other part is fluffy    Who are we kidding there's no leaving this website   I smell a calzone! Costanza is in the building!   The opening scene to this is one of the funniest   He posted that shit 2 weeks ago. Which means he had the easiest case of cancer ever, he knew he was about to make a full recovery, or he's full of shit   Did some research. OP seems to post stuff in fantasy and writing subreddits. He's also the mod of r/shadestaff however it seems like a week old.  Looking up on Amazon the book came out about 6 months ago. Don't really have an opinion but these are the facts  Edit: I agree though that user has got to be an alt   I always kinda thought Ted's part in this was ridiculous. She reached for the check? I mean I know he seems to have some obsession with that as seen with the cat loving date pt. 2 girl but still. Beercules is awesome though   I just had war flashbacks to open labs   "Are you wearing mascara"  I am a guy  and no   I'll grow some kale. We need to be as organically hipster as possible   How else would they walk in to a porno?   I ensure that quality yet affordable products are well stocked at all times for the everyday working American and offer any answers to questions they may have. Aka, a sales associate at Walmart   I think every character had a good plot in this episode. I also really enjoyed Barney and Robins dance. It pretty much makes no sense but showing off their talent makes up for it.   That scene at the beginning though with Ted and Marshal outside on the bench though. I kept waiting for that in Season 9 and it never happened, I didn't expect the same dialog but something to show it at least   every school ever   You can definitely tell there are far more viewers here than there are commenters. I almost feel bad because I reply to most the threads here but it would be nice to hear more people's opinions on things. Like other people said though there's less and less new ideas to be discussed   I always thought Marshal and Barney change the most. Seeing Marshal in Season 1 he looks like he's in college still, and Barneys face gets more defined wrinkles by the end. Robin and Ted hardly change at all IMO, and Lily "has statutory written all over her"   I had that exact car in high school. Super fun car to drive with the manual transmission and its turn radius is amazing   Wow, that's actually really subtle. Nice observation   Lol. And apparently 5 new bars in downtown, just found that out when I visited last week on spring break   Electricity doesn't just shoot out of outlets   There's good naked and then there's bad naked   I've been there before a couple times. There's not a worse feeling than knowing the next few hours are going to be really uncomfortable and you just want to leave that second   Someone get this man gold  Edit: Guess I prove my point from the downvotes   That's funny because Puyallup is a pretty decent suburb with not much crime at all   Same here it's kind of blowing my mind right now. I was really shocked to see Puyallup on the front of News   The person I know who's color blind goes out of his way every possible time to mention he's color blind. In class there will be a diagram with things labeled and different colors and every time he says "fuck you I"m colorblind!" Like yeah we get it now, you'd think he actually can't distinguish colors at all   Civil war when the government tries to ban firearms from the people   I always wonder how call of duty became more popular than MoH. The campain on the first 3 computer games from MoH were amazing   I thought that was only on the Oregon Trail   Lead a slave revolution? Become pharaoh?    l   I figured she said that without knowing she made a famous Star Trek reference. Or this whole thing is made up, either way   "We're going to the bathroom, you guys figure out what we're doing next"  Of course us guys then proceed to make cool structures with our forks and knives   Well I do live in a college town, not much choice   Right? I've watched How i Met your mother since I was 19 and when I turned 21 I was pretty disappointed to find out that bars are super crowded, noisy to the point you cant hear anyone, and there's never a girl just sitting there waiting to be hit on   http://img1.goodfon.su/wallpaper/big/5/b7/klaviatura-klava-kompyuter.jpg  Found something similar but I had the same question   Banya!   Today, let my asshat be yourasshat :)   They say when you hit 14 in the 8th grade is when you really mature   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSuvOVH0aSQ t=3m4s    Yes.   I agree with this. Or the opposite happens where one or both people want to branch out and just need some space   True but that would be way less of a fine if anything   I practiced for a whole summer and still can't land that trick   r/unexpected? The only unexpected thing is that it's trending  	110
 I bent the ones on my z97n wifi motherboard by putting the usb 3.0 header from my case in the wrong way. It will bend the pins so bad if you dont line it up because there is a blocked off pin on the cable to "prevent" it from going in. I tried a straw and it was a bit to big, so i used the mini straw off of some canned air and carefully bent the pins back. Luckily, they work perfect now.   Go check out the Dell inspiron 15 non touch. They are on sale on the dell website for $249 which is the cheapest laptop i have seen in a while (besides a chromebook).   Most of the people I have talked to that wanted to go into the game industry (quite a few) changed their mind very quickly. Just because you like to play games does not mean you will like to make them. That field is a big money maker for the small "ITT Tech" schools and they know that. So many people want to go into game design that you have to be the cream of the crop when it comes around to getting a job, or you have to hit it big as an indie developer. If I were you I would seriously reconsider your job path.    There is on gas station that has it for $3.17 here in South Carolina. I live in North Carolina, but i am so close to the border (gastonia) that its cheaper to just drive to South Carolina to fill up.   Your CPU is running a bit hot, even on idle. I would clean the CPU with isopropyl alcohol and reapply a good thermal paste like arctic silver.   That should be the cause of the temps, or either your CPU cooler is not making good contact with the CPU.    We have the next best where I live, and that is Cookout. Cookout milkshakes are so good, it makes the milkshake in that picture look like a garbage Wendy's frosty.   I think the gpu they decided to use is underpowered for an almost 4k resolution display. Even a single gtx 780ti/titan black has trouble playing games at 4k, which is what this computer is marketed as. Laptop gpus are much weaker than their desktop counterparts.  The only game that i see running at 4k maxed out on this laptop are source engine games and various others. (counter strike, dota 2, team fortress 2, etc.)   Exactly, you hit the nail on the head. I have built "gaming" computers, but when I tried my first macbook pro with retina display, the OS just sold me. That influenced me to build my hackintosh, and it was the best decision i ever made.   	8
 I should have mentioned the monitor off button. Whoever did this doesn't want you to disrupt the signal.   So you can see it too?! First nobody could see my posts and now this? Things keep changing and I don't know what's happening. I shouldn't have told you to go there. I don't know what will happen to you if you do.   **[part 1](http://redd.it/3dki98)**   nbsp;  If you havent read the first part of the story, I suggest you take a look at [part 1](http://redd.it/3dki98). What you're about to see (if you can even see it) might not make much sense otherwise. Im not sure how much sense it makes either way to be honest. I found something on this computer yesterday that shook me to my core.    nbsp;  Please tell me if you can go to:    nbsp;  **[www.screamlouder.info](http://www.screamlouder.info/)**   nbsp;  I dont know if anyone can, and I dont know if anyone should. I didnt even know people could see my first post until recently.   nbsp;  The link was just sitting there in a .txt file, tucked away in My Documents with a single line reading To help you scream at night. I didnt need to click on it. I shouldnt have. but what would you do, being trapped in a place like this? I said I wanted answers and I got them. I honestly cant tell if this is just a joke, or a pet project from someone at the radio station. Someone with time on their hands and a sickness, remedied only by their own grand delusions.  but I guess Ive recently developed some pretty awful delusions as well. Its been two weeks now, and aside from the stuff I mentioned in my first post, there hadnt been much activity until yesterday. I dont know if its the paranoia setting in after finding screamlouder.info, but Im seeing things now. Hearing things. Moving shadows in the abandoned remnants of homes, the sound of wind where I cant feel a single hair move above my head...   And all your comments, Ill read them but sometimes they dont look right. Sometimes they sound wrong in my head. They scare me. Then I look again, and I understand that Ive received nothing but kind words and different methods to get out of here.  That reminds me, I tried to leave. It was 2 days ago. I thought there might be a path through the mountains somewhere. I packed a backpack full of food and supplies and made my way through the forest. After a mile or so, I came to a river. Completely black. The sludge blocked my way.   I followed it all the way around town and back behind the cabin on the hill. Ive been on an island this whole time! I found a road leading to a bridge west of the radio station, but it had collapsed into the sludge below. I threw a log into the stuff at one point to see if I could swim through and it sank like itd fallen in tar. I imagined myself in place of the log, slowly sinking, deeper and deeper until the black ooze filled my lungs. I wept.   nbsp;   Im losing hope by the minute you guys, and I dont know how much more I can take. Worse than everything though, was last nights incident   nbsp;  It was maybe 11 or 12 oclock at night and I couldnt sleep. Too many questions were buzzing in my head. I decided to go for a walk to clear my mind and get some air. Typically a fools choice this late at night, but strangely the electricity still works here and the street lights were lit up on all the poles that hadnt fallen. It provided me with sight and a sense of security. With or without light though, If it meant getting away from that computer room for awhile, Id take my chances.  Id just passed the street where I laid out some parking cones reminding me to stay away from that awful payphone, when I noticed a building that I must have seen a dozen times but never really bothered to look at. Through the windows I could see chrome rimmed tables and chairs, booth seating stretching from one end to the other, and framed pictures of places around town I could already identify (Im becoming too familiar with this place, god I want to leave). The sign above the building was brightly lit with some of the letters burnt out. Au_ie _ays Diner  This must have been the diner from that website. I hated the thought of exploring unfamiliar territory after dark but I needed to make a connection, find some semblance of understanding in this place before I could sleep again. If this yokal restaurant had real answers waiting for me inside, nothing could keep me out.  The front door swung open effortlessly. Looks like the locking mechanism had been torn off in the storm. To my right in this darkened room was a lightswitch that, after several flicks from my hand, proved itself unusable.   nbsp;  *click*   nbsp;  The flashlight I took from my stash of emergency gear shot a stream of light at the kitchen behind the front counter. Hundreds of empty pie tins were stacked from floor to ceiling, covering every square inch of the room. Award winning pies was an understatement for this level of disarray.  Stumbling over broken plates and stray tins, I wandered into the hallway behind the counter in search of a circuit breaker. I kept my eyes forward and alert while I brushed my hand against the wall, hoping to catch the change from wallpaper to metal. Near the end of my path, I felt a wet spot. Shivers went down my spine as I shined the light on my fingers.   nbsp;  **Black.**   nbsp;  Hoping it wasnt what I thought it was, I brought my fingers to my nose and sniffed.   nbsp;  It smelled like berries and corn syrup. Thank god, just pie filling.   nbsp;  I shined my light over to the spot on the wall Id just touched, and noticed a crease in the wallpaper. I followed it up the wall and then over and down again. It was in the shape of a door. Someone had sealed a room off from the rest of the diner.  Hundreds of pie tins crashed as I shuffled my way into the kitchen. I needed a knife to cut through the paper. I spotted one on the stove that was covered in pie filling. It seemed like thats all theyve been serving for a long time now.  I returned to the door, put down my flashlight, and dug the serving knife into the wall where the creases lay. As I dug, I noticed a flow of air from the room. It carried with it a sickly sweet smell. The scent of a secret decayed by neglect.  After I sliced through the perimeter, I felt for the spot where a knob should have been. Instead there was a hanging ring handle inlaid into the wood of the door. After cutting a hole, I grabbed the handle and pulled.  The inside was dark. I heard a drawn out gloop and squelch as something from the ceiling fell to the floor. I picked up my flashlight and peered inside. The walls and ceiling were coated inches thick in blackberry filling. It looked like week old coagulated blood, and it didnt smell much better. I held my shirt above my nose to keep from inhaling too much of it. I quickly shined my flashlight around the room and there in the back corner was a blob of flesh.  Man or woman I wasnt certain but they must have been five or six hundred pounds if not more. They sat there completely naked and lathered in pie filling, motionless against the wall. They must have added to the stench weeks or even months ago. It was a renaissance painting of the path to hell via gluttony.   nbsp;  I stumbled backwards with dry, night-terror screams. I couldnt handle this, none of it made sense, and I needed to leave! NOW! but I couldnt feel my legs! I just stood there motionless in the dark, completely escaped from my body, repeating in my head *what the fuck is happening?!*  Then I caught my breath, eyes returned to focus, and I booked it without looking back. I screamed through the empty town, with no response but my own echoes off the nearby rubble. I ran up the stairs of the radio station, tripping over myself on the way. I hid in my bed for the rest of the night, eyes wide open peering through my sheets. unblinking.  That brings us to now. I knew this, more than ever, was when I needed to call for help again. I see your comments, I know youre out there...I just wish I knew you were real and not just in my head. I cant believe any of this!  How does a place like this exist and more importantly, who or what killed the person in that hidden room? I know I said I was lonely before, but now I pray more than anything that Im alone.   nbsp;  I'm not ready to give up on leaving this place quite yet. I'll keep you all posted if anything else happens.    please stay.   Thank you for the encouragment. I really need it right now. I'm not always sure if I'm alone anymore. I'll post more soon. P.S. naming the streets might be good, who knows how long I'll be here. Who knows how long I'll be alone. Please stay here.  	5

One of the better superhero movies out there.   As a former muslim, I can confidently say that Islam is exactly like that.  There is a very popular hadith that pretty much itemizes how one gets into heaven.    First, you have to physically and outwardly be religious. If you can't accomplish that, you must at least be inwardly religious and god fearing. If you can't do that or are another religion, there's still hope!!  All you have to do is believe in the one-ness of god, regardless of what name you call him by. If you can't accomplish this, perhaps missionaries were unable to reach you with the holy message in time, then you can still get into heaven.  All you have to do is have an ounce of goodness in you.

Also, I didn't know the Constant Gardener was directed by the same person who did City of God. Both fantastic films. One hit wonder status rescinded.   This is one where I think RT got it wrong.

That man is ridiculous.   oh you   I like how this one got more upvotes than the one on /r/Tinder             could you expand on that?   Reddit is just two guys trolling each other with multiple alt accounts.   Lyoto walks around at that weight now.  When he moved down to middle weight, he said he was going for a permanent weight loss to make the cut to 185 easier.  I truly believe he should fight at WW.  And have always believed that.  He clearly has better dicsipline than Rumble or Hendricks, so being out of shape between fights would never be an issue for him.      I have been defeated.   Doesn't GSP cut from 200 down to welterweight?  Hendricks?  Look how big Rory is in this pic.  It's not impossible.   God dammit, Lyoto.   This is not considered "calling out"   hence, the title   And there's Machida, trying to walk around at his fighting weight.  Why won't he do a drastic weight cut like these guys, and fight people who are actually his size, like welterweights?

Milfs.  Now that man knows how to party.   I dont know what you just said   Some strip clubs in the states let your hands roam free.  In one club I went to, it is a generally accepted rule that you can finger the stripper while she gives you a handjob.  That's called the "club's handshake".  At other clubs, you can negotiate blowjobs and fucking if the private dance area is discrete enough.   She probably should not have said that.   What the fuck?

 I agree. But I loved the cross-over episodes! I just found Angel to be to brooding.   Ha, ha my first name is Devlin but I figured that I'd put my username.   Okay, thank you :)   So what does this have to do with the mandela effect?      When I was a kid my family and I moved to the countryside. For the first four years we lived in a small town which was fine but we eventually moved, quite litterally to the middle of nowhere. It was this one street town with like 4 houses. It was ok because I spent most of my time indoors anyway (I've always been indoors-ey). The house we were living in was big, much bigger than anything I had ever stayed in before (before we moved to the countryside we lived in a suburban area of a city with a pretty big home, then a small town, then the middle of nowhere). Most of the bedrooms were upstairs but there was one down stairs. Everytime you went in it it was cold, when I say cold I mean it felt like ice, you could always see your breath. So, as a rule, I stayed out of there. The rest of the house was awesome and my brothers and sisters and I had a pretty cool time living there but I started getting horrible feelings whenever I went near the cold room: My eyes would water like I was going to cry, I would get a sore chest. I always tried to keep myself calm by explaining to myself that it was just me, I got a sore chest because of my asthma, I had watery eyes because of some other reason I'm sure I found less than convincing. The part that gets creepy was when our kitchen was being remodeled. Because of the layout of the kitchen we had to move the fridge into the cold bedroom untill the remodelling was finished. I couldn't stand going in there and eventually I straight out refused. You see I spend a lot of time with my two dogs (who were younger at the time) since I'm almost always inside and whenever they went near that room they would show their teeth and raise their hackles, which they virtually never do. One night I fell asleep and had this nightmare. In it I went into the room to get something as fast as I possibly could but then the door slammed shut and I couldn't open it for the life of me. On the other side my brother was trying to force it open. Then this man appeared he was clothed in a huge black cloak and started mumbling words I couldn't make out before he started choking me. I woke up coughing like mad and had, what I call, a "mini" asthma attack. I told my mum the next morning and she starred as if looking through me not at me. Then she said: 'XboxG4mer I had the exact same dream' She never wanted to freak me out so straight away she comforted me by telling me it was just a dream. I kept having the same nightmare and I never asked her but I think my mum did too because after a couple of months we moved away. The man in the dream was old but looked wholly evil. I don't know what happened in that house but there was something about that room. Nothing could warm it and the eery sensations I got when near it were stronger than any I've ever felt.   The protagonist(s) survive the impossible.      Eeh that's the subreddit for the show.   Ha, ha okay   I like that too. I don't live in the states so it's nice to speak to others that do. Or anywhere else really.      I used to bite my nails a lot. The best thing you can do is cut them with scissors or nail clippers and keep them short by cutting regularly that way you won't be able to bite them and eventually you won't want to because you'll be used to keeping them short using other means.    Awesome I'll check it out :)   Awesone I just messaged you :)   I'll invite you too a group and we can meet at the shrine in the rift.   Awesome if you're on now I'll do it :)      Orange is the new black. Oh my god amazing show can't wait for s4.   Love it! What did you think of the ending? I called it years ago and when I was right I felt kinda sad. I did like the ending though it was realistic.   Angel isn't nearly as good imo. I always found him to brooding.   Ha, ha one month! Amateur, week and a half here. I watched them wiithout stopping except for the wee hours of sleep that I got.

Not buried, I read it :)      Try and draw a a sexy female poo, with long brown hair, glasses and a little black or red dress.   http://m.imgur.com/FYSUSV1   When I was a kid my family and I moved to the countryside.

When I did a quick google of the street it turned up nothing and gave me the names of nearby locations. I'll update again soon.  ***EDIT 2*** So I found it on the googs (sounds weird, google sounds better). However it only spoke about how the "village" once had a larger population, a school and a train station etc but after the coal mining industry in the area was done many people moved and full streets lay empty. I knew all of this and when I say full streets I mean like 15 houses maybe 20, barely anyone lives there today.   Wow. That's an awesome story. Kudos to you and your brother for keeping calm. Is he still serving? Have you since gone camping in that area?    How many steps have I taken in my entire life?   How many people have there been since the dawn of time?   Don't ever talk about tucking snails! They're evil and terrifying!   Free will. I wondered about this a long time ago and aske  my self even though I technically could do anything I want is that my fate? To end up wherever I do because of what I do. So for a while I just did completely random, out of the ordinary things. I don't see any special results. Nothing monumental, good or bad happened and I don't see how it could lead me to my fate. We can do whatever we want.   It's a choice you can make just tell her your views on the matter.   I don't know about where you live but here it's a choic you can make when you turn eleven, regardless of what your parents say.   This is just a re-post of that post that said the same thing about the tallest person. It's kind of sad what people will do for karma. Also they might not have been since they may have been born fat and never experienced a skinny lifestyle.   No he wasn't. There would've been babies who were born that were smaller than him at birth.      How about we get married, in Summer, in a church in Antarctica? Then we jump into our sled pulled by dogs and go on a magical ride to Hawaii where we can enjoy our honeymoon?   Woohoo! We'll get married in winter in a church. You have to make me feel loved.   I'll do it for free in exactly 13 hours 24 minutes and 16 seconds if you're on the EU server   Marry me!   History. I could talk about it forever. I'm also deeply passionate about books and gaming.   It sounds really dangerous. Microwaves aren't safe when they have faults. They can cause various problems. I don't know exactly what's happening with your microwave but I definitely recommend that you get a new one.    Get rid of it and buy a new one, that sounds extremely dangerous.    Good for you, I never used socks but I now have tissues since joining   Aaw, that's too bad.   You are a good man.   I just want to say, I don't intend on trying it but I'm just curious. Please don't say 2/3 times.   After you eat anything wash the bowl/plate etc. It stops dishes from piling up.  Empty the trash frequently and taking shoes off at the front door is a good rule if you have carpets.   Set aside a couple of hours one day a week and wash your windows and doors etc.  I realise they were more about keeping it clean. As for organisation:  Keep things in certain places. You keep your clothes in your wardrobe and dishes in the cupboard so do the same thing and set certain locations for certain things.   A good I dea is a coat rack. Some can be bought that are pretty nice and they stop jackets from piling up.     It is Harold.   Good for you man. Society does justify it way to much. Just cause it's "normal" doesn't make it good, slavery was once normal and so was burning people for being witches. I'm not comparing these three things just making a point. I've had a few times were I've made it for weeks but as far as porn goes I went months without it... untill recently. I still don't regret it though because I now know more than ever that I don't enjoy it or want to see it. Good luck friend.   Im a vorarephiliac. It involves people being eaten etc. You can read about it [here.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vorarephilia)   I think I was around ten. We enjoyed the entire day and in the night she came to see us. We were playing with our new toys and she asked if we had a good day? We answered "aye" (from Scotland :) ) we spoke for a while about how fun they were and then she told us gently. I can't remember exactly what she said but she did it right cause weren't upset or angry. At the time we were beggining to question Santa's motives for bringing us free stuff (kidding but we were at the age were you question his authenticity).    Yeah, I'm in a large group of people who roleplay as werewolves, we take it pretty seriously. There are even larger ones that do all sorts of things you just have to find them.   Green. Or bumpy.   When she figured we were getting to old my mum sat me and my twin down on christmas night and explained gently to us. It went really well and we understood. She did the same thing with my older siblings.   My sister's friend's cousin's girlfriend's mum's friend's nephew was in a photo of some sort that was used to represent some sort of product somewhere.   Yeah people on the internet always lie, I also have a 11" dick. Really!   If everyone that had said that did then the average would be 11" and it wouldn't be so special.   I saw it in a Matthew Santoro video on youtube.      Yeah, fun game. Don't get me wrong I like pc gaming but I just prefer consoles.   You are an extremely gifted writer. Most TIFU post with anything even remotely similar are people complaining or trying, and failing, to be funny. You made me laugh so much while I was reading. I hope your, eh little you, gets better fast.   Well it's better than playstation and I don't enjoy pc gaming.   I see them as a people with a nice cultural background who are often taken advantage of by other ethnic groups.   No. Even if the answer was yes, I would say aye.   Ha, ha oh my god that was great! Did you make it? If so well done.   All the time on xbox. I'm Scottish so I'm always asked if I wear kilts, have ginger hair, drink whiskey etc.   By British you probably mean English. I'm Scottish (technically British) and I can't stand those people or their terrible jokes.   What you have to first understand is that the government cannot just print money as it needs to have a value. Here in Scotland our money is worth sterling. So if we wanted we could go to a bank and request sterling (but no one does). Instead of everyone carrying said sterling we carry notes to represent them.    So the government, here can print depending on the amount of sterling we have. If they print beyond what we have inflation occurs and prices rise. This was a major issue in Weimar Germany 1923 and again in 1929.   So to answer your question: Governments can and should print within what they have, depending on what the currency represents.    Around a decade ago NASA sent a space probe, called new horizons, on a journey. It is now closer to Pluto than any man-made object has ever been and can take much better photographs than our current technology allows via the use of telescopes.    I do this but don't suck in too much :)   The breeze (Brianna) from the "GONE" [series](http://www.michaelgrantbooks.co.uk/gone/) by Michael Grant.   She and I were around the same age when I read it (14) and she was everything I liked in a girl. Long(ish) Brown hair, witty, smart, a little bit cocky. She was just an awesome, well written character and then...  ***SPOILER ALERT***                                   They killed her off in the most inhumane way possible! I still cry at night. (Joking) but seriously she was awesome.       There's a very good theory that bypasses all of that. It's a bit far fetched but possible.   Good luck OP. Maybe it has something to do with your old arrowhead shaped rock. If you still have that I wouldn't throw it away. I would go back to the tunnel you mentioned at the first chance I got and leave it there. Either way stay safe.    Wow, weird. To me it sounds like she was killing them and taking different parts of each mens body together to make one "perfect man".   I know it's late but I made it to the front page of askreddit and got over 10,000 messages and I can't clear them all or read my actual messages from other posts!   I know right!   I know I'm late but hopefully you will read this. First of all I'm sorry you guys can't have children. I think you should tell your mum to stop torturing you and your wife. I know it's not an easy thing to do, trust me it's not, but maybe you should give her an ultimatum. Tell her it's not Claires fault she can't have children and if she doesn't give you both a sincere apology and stop upsetting you both then you want nothing to do with her. I know that sounds like a terrible thing to say to her but she will most definitely choose you and I know it will cause friction and tension but another option is that you sit down with her and Claire and explain that adoption is in no way evil and tell her she needs to stop, this is no one's fault.   I love these so much!!!!!!!!   Aaaaagh Felix!! :D How much? Honestly how much?!   Ha, ha she's gorgeous!      Wow, all I can say is good luck and I hope you do complete it and manage to compete.   Ha, ha what a great and inspirational man.   I saw it. I like that one.   Ha, ha nice one.   I would replace it with [this.](https://m.youtube.com/#/watch?v=76RrdwElnTU)   Jafar from Aladdin. Sure he seems evil but if you think about it he is trying to save the kingdom from the idiot sultan who doesn't even notice the widespread poverty and famine in his own kingdom... and he's also trying to become an evil dictator but what's a little dictation amongst friends?   Ha! :D   That's a nice quote. You might've been late but I still read it :)   Yeah, no.   It doesn't have to just be in eso it can be from arena-daggerfall-morrowind-oblivion-skyrim-eso (also redguard and battlespire).   Yeah, no.   Either way I love him. He was so funny and during the planemeld he wanted to stop it, not to save nirn, but to "save" coldharbour from getting to much like tamriel.    I remember reading that post, sad for the guy but at least he probably inspired others to not make the same mistakes.   Me too :)   Ha, ha this made me laugh.   Wow good job :) (Not being sarcastic, seriously nice words).   I honestly can't remember who said it but I remember reading:   I am not a a pessimist for they look at the world with negative views and thoughts. Nor am I an optimist for they look at the world and often try and see the good where there is none. I am a realist. I am happy when things are good and face the hard times when they arrive.    It wasn't that exactly but it was something like that.   I'm actually studying history and I love that quote, along with:  "History is not history, unless it is the truth":- Abraham Lincoln.   Ha, ha I used to, scrap that, I do love Rugrats!   WT?!   Ha, ha the end made me laugh :) I like that quote too.   Ha, ha this made me laugh.   I'll be back... to write some more Arnie quotes with you later and you better do it!   I like that :)   Okaaaaay.   Wai- wait what?! I blew up?! AAAAAGH!! :D I don't really use facebook. I have it but... meh.   Okaaaay.   I ***LOVE*** Mass Effect, great games, great quote :)   I think that's also the Nike slogan :)   I like that and I have to say, as a fellow gamer, I don't think it's wasting time. You're socializing, having fun and even though you might not realize it you learn quite a lot from videogames.    Ha, ha I might not have the power but I don't drink, I don't smoke, I don't do drugs... I play video games aswell! As a fellow gamer with virtually no right to say this... I declare the above quote to be under permanent ownership by /r/Lizardizzle   Aaa thanks!   ***EDIT 1*** Wow! I just woke up and this post blew up!! Thank you all!! :D   Life would look bad since we see in much higher "fps" (of course life doesn't have frames but you know what I mean)  	119
 Why didn't this happen to Andrew Wakefield?      The Quran is VERY anti-gay.  Live you life, but don't just twist a blatant lie to help your case.   From the past? He's LITERALLY one of the most influential people of the last 100 years.                                 AND the video is unlisted.    Not entirely.  Geopolitics is unpopular but its definitely a problem that will never be hidden by ignoring it. The USA thinks it needs that leverage internationally.    he shits on TV a LOT for someone who stays on it      The man has argued in front of the Supreme court himself. He's not stupid   So this is going to go down like gay marriage, huh?   Up to 70 now http://news.yahoo.com/car-bomb-kills-least-11-soldiers-egypts-sinai-081925064.html   Sayyid Qutb says hello   Are you really telling me you fell into the mythology that he was REALLY that honest? The man hated black people and pretended not to.    Are you really telling me you fell into the mythology that he was REALLY that honest? The man hated black people and pretended not to.    I always wonder what these laws mean or how they're enforced because it seems like its pretty easy to cross the line and not know it...or maybe I don't understand.    The cords on these are retarded.    g'luck    Logitech UE900 cable   mine just started to short out at the 3.5mm end. Absolutely drives me insane.   barely 6 months   I believe it's similar to the situation in Russia. Putin too intelligent and worldly to be as personally religious and homophobic as his policies and statements reflect, but the Russian people are something like 80% orthodox and not too fond of the gays, and he's ultimately culpable to their opinions.    if you saw the last season of House of Cards, the russian leader kinda reminds me of what you're implying.          or to make sure your DSLR wasn't a gun   Whose rights were taken away here?    You can't be POTUS for 8 years and be perfect   Obama won   Well the only reason KSA is so screwed is BECAUSE of the schism between the religious rulers and the royal family   any chance it has a mic?   SEVEN CHURCHES HAVE BURNED IN THE AREA IN THE LAST WEEK  http://www.npr.org/2015/06/29/418490411/arsonists-hit-6-black-churches-in-5-southern-states   Yeah. WHITE people.   Are you fucking stupid?   The KKK burned down the same church in 1995. Bill Clinton even viewed the site in 1996: https://youtu.be/z4g27k499Cs  SEVEN black churches have burned in the last week. The ATF is going nuts right now.     White supremacists are upset.   The KKK burned down the same church in 1995. Bill Clinton even viewed the site in 1996: https://youtu.be/z4g27k499Cs   You dumbass  **Do you know ANYTHING about the history of burning black churches in the USA? Or ANYTHING about white supremacist terrorism on black people?**  The KKK burned down the same church in 1995. Bill Clinton even viewed the site in 1996: https://youtu.be/z4g27k499Cs   The KKK burned down the same church in 1995. Bill Clinton even viewed the site in 1996: https://youtu.be/z4g27k499Cs   Don't worry, Reddit says race isn't a factor anymore         Well will look at this?   I'm sure the Putin-ites are shocked      Are you American?  I need to know before I answer this   What sort of pseudoscience is this?            Theres TONS of factors.    This is going to massively shift radio for small artists.    How would you even determine if there was a correlation?  It seems like a stupid question to even investigate.    This is the same thing that led to recalls   wha? How? carbon fiber? gravity?  Are you a wizard?   I bet you think the WTC shouldn't have collapsed either   They ALL deserve it   She's a beaver who lives in bikini bottom   It is for many people.         And France will never have a culture of innovation. But hey, whatever suits them   Do you realize how NOTORIOUS France is for being anti-business? They wouldn't even compromise! And this place pretends to be a leading nation?   Whoever is in charge of interacting with companies like Uber could have avoided this    Lets not pretend that France isn't notorious for not "seeing the future" if you will, and effectively standing in the way of such progression by way of taking chances.    I believe it does, even though I don't support it.   I don't see it as far fetched that inspired people take their inspirations to the next level.   Why is mental illness your cop-out?    He really almost got away   I did not support the Iraq War   This highlights the culture of innovation that a lot of other nations don't have.  Uber could ONLY have been invented in places like the USA. France has got to be one of the most anti-business places ever.    Why is it only a problem when the US conducts espionage?  Are we supposed to just sit back and lose leverage around the world while everyone turns an eye to other nations doing it?  I don't feel guilty for the US being powerful.    If France wasn't selling war-ships to russia, then we wouldn't have to do that.   I see no foul here.    its just a rug   This is why the US is the innovation capital...and France isn't.   Amazing   Bloomberg is really turning the tide...      Uh...what the hell?               They're like the largest spenders and STILL can't defeat some ragtag rebels on their border   This show is going to stick.   Is it even possible for him to successfully accomplish any of some of the talking points he makes frequently?   Those are huge            http://www.cnn.com/2015/06/27/us/new-york-prison-break/index.html            This.  If I want to use my data to stream a podcast that got released 2 minutes ago, I shouldn't have to be on WIFI to do it.    They rioted because the cops killed a dude for no reason.   Buzzfeed has been doing VERY well with original content.    Greece is in a...slippery situation...            Redwing. Period.   And he didn't even quote Michelle Alexander who wrote the book: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_Jim_Crow  bastard   ...huh?      NY in general needs more train lines...anything over 1/3rd of a mile from a stop is unacceptable.    True, but they're probably the only people who end up affording this stuff.       racism isn't just the n-word. Its attitudes and behaviors.     The fact of the matter is that black unemployment is not institutionalize racism.  False.   Red-lining did more to harm the black community than you'll ever understand.  There are systematic efforts to keep minorities out of certain communities and thus certain jobs.  Racism didn't just disappear overnight dumbass   Handling white supremacy IS a big deal. Lets not pretend that it just magically went away   I can't think of a more costly mistake to be recorded by Russian intelligence services and released showing US interests in overthrowing the Ukrainian president that led to the present situation that places Russia and the USA back in another cold war.    its not even cute...I bet its super heavy       so basically, make it up as you go along?    Democracy isn't really meant for everyone      http://www.vox.com/2015/6/26/8849925/obama-obamacare-history-presidents      lulz         Lilly Ledbetter?   ACA?  Gay rights? DOMA? DADT?  Fairer sentencing?   Shifting drug enforcement policy?    Obama opposed gay marriage to get elected. He's supported it since 1996: http://www.politico.com/blogs/bensmith/0109/Obama_backed_samesex_marriage_in_1996.html         The sheer number of wins he's racked up over the course of these last two years have been incredible...is he on the track to have one of the best legacies of any president ever?   EDIT: http://www.vox.com/2015/6/26/8849925/obama-obamacare-history-presidents   did you see that video of that guy in Atlanta who takes loaded AR-15s into the airport under the guise of "self protection" just to troll cops?                   ...don't push it.   How wrong is this article?   The flag that has since been adopted has roots in these very ideals.                   Well then we'd have to get rid of Florida, Alabama, NC, TN, and AR as well      Put it in a museum. Why do we honor traitors?    how?   *Dzhokhar be kidding me!*    I don't think the issue is racist hiring practices (it's more likely a poverty/education disparity) but it shows that we've still got aways to go before people are really afforded the same opportunities.  Do you really think this?            he had no choice.   every major retailer jumped ship         did it affect his care?   SJWs?  Wheres your Nazi flag then?      this doesn't mean what you think it does         This, but theres not even an option for it to adjust what counts as "played"                              decisions...      China and Russia make sure they don't fall TOO far behind    Hillary is pretty terrible   At least credit Obama:  http://www.cbsnews.com/news/president-obama-60-minutes/      Job well done.   I play a lot of songs in public for people but its hard to know what I exactly played and when...and when I go back and try to figure it out, its hard to remind people of what I actually played or make lists for them.  Is there a way to skirt this issue and create a temporary playlist or enable a certain column ranking option?    yeah, but it doesn't show the order of songs you played    What do you mean?

Its never white supremacy and inherent racism, right?         I love it. I'm all in   Meanwhile China doesn't have a TPP...it just takes what it wants.   Do you know any black people?  Are you black?  Do anti-black terrorist groups that are over 100 years old not bother you?  	190

 Thank you everyone for the great responses!   Being french, it hurts me :'(   I somewhat understand this, but please tell me what 'capex' means :p   I am very disappointing by Arianespace. It existed for such a long time, but is partly government owned and depends on subsidies. SpaxeX started out solo, and has grown successful due to innovation and efficiency. Now Arianespace is begging for more subsidies.   If europe's space industry is to grow large, it needs more competition, more businesses aiming for efficiency, and broad government subsidies, not targeted at specific companies.   Hey r/rocketlaunches,  This is my first post here as I just recently started to be interested in this. Im only 17 and did basic Physics (and Chemistry, both IGCSE Physics Higher Level for those familiar. Got 93% in science.), and now pursue other subjects.  So with my limited knowledge, could you please tell me where to start off when learning about the physics behind launching rockets, how rockets work, how SpaceX is making them more efficient price and mass wise, what are the main issues with launching rockets now, as well as travel to Mars (radiation and other problems to maintain a crew to the red planet).  Are there articles, videos, maybe even books, that I should start reading? Thank you very much, I look forward to learning anything and everything! :D   :'(   Thank you. I expect more mistakes to come.    Hey r/mapporn! To commemorate the end of the war, here are maps that show the events unfolding. Please tell me any inaccuracies! I want to note I did this unrelated to Mapporn and throughout a rather long time period, so the quality is inferior to my expectations.  http://imgur.com/a/JzU3O  Key: I did not think of it as being crucial considering everyone knows about world war 2, but here it is:  Blue: Allies  Dark light blue: UK  Light light blue: occupied allied* territory and colonies  Dark dark blue: France  Light dark blue: occupied french territory and colonies  Red: USSR and allies  Dark red: USSR  Light red: occupied soviet territory  Axis: Grey  Dark grey: Nazi Germany  Medium grey: German allies  Light grey: Axis occupied territory  Blue arrows: allied movements  Red arrows: soviet movement  Black arrows: axis movement  *Allies: includes all shown on map, USA, other colonies and dominions, and post-liberated France.  Again, I want to apologise for the low quality, I did not mean to do them to post them here.Furthermore, please find any mistakes, I am sure there are many! I want to apologise in advance for the lack of Lake Lagoda, lack of consistency in the shades and again for the poor camera quality.      Hey r/mapporn!

Even if it had a higher value, its rise is so extreme it will crash before growing higher. Is my reasoning flawed?   That's why I emphasised how my analysis is based on so much more. Sorry for not being clear enough. But thanks for telling me nonetheless.   That should be a quote! When was the last time you invested in something?   Detailed and logical answer. I am curious however, is looking at fundamentals of the economy a reliable way to analyse the stock market? The stock market reflects the confidence in an economy, and may (usually) has wide discrepancies with the quality of underlying firms, and an even wider discrepancy with the fundamentals of the economy. There is also irrational emotions of the masses to consider.  You certainly are more knowledgeable than me, I am just curious.   Great answer! Never thought of that. So what are you doing now? Are you just waiting for the dip?   Im the OP, and thanks for all the great answers. Still would love to continue reading this great debate. I personally had a small question: if I were to keep cash, should I just keep it or buy short term government bonds in countries that have no chance* to collapse?  *Yes yes, I know. You know what I mean.   Its okay guys, im in Paris XD   :D Criticism is always welcome. I'm already subscribed to both :)   Thanks   Thanks for the great answer. But I couldnt help but mention that France has the glorious euro.   Great response. Thank you.   Thank you for your response.   Thanks. Was always curious.   At least 40% :'(  Being 17 and doing this small time, what are the chances of gettting caught and what consequences will occur if I don't pay it?  	25
 I am in the process of completing courses to apply to the School of Psychology. As of today, I have three courses (all in psychology) and need a suggestion on what to enroll in to fill that extra slot. If the art department allowed for students to take one measly class, I'd be set, but they don't, and now I'm left trying to decide on a class.   Suggestions?   Sex trafficking.   KCMO is the 2nd largest city for trafficking both men and women.    If it was accessed via a VPN, or other services, there's nothing they can really do.       After running in to my Senior year English teacher a few years back, I told him that I had read spark notes for almost every book he had assigned. After rereading them in college, it was a shame I didn't understand that level of reading just a few years prior.                     I enjoyed the park during the early to late 90s, but it went down hill after that.    8th grade class trip back in middle school was to Joyland. After going on the water ride, I smelt like sewage. It was so gross. Plus I looked as white as a ghost after riding the rollercoaster.  Never missed the place after that visit.          One step in education, one giant ~~step~~ leap for the State of Kansas.            Not sure how many people pay attention to the classifieds section of the Kansan, but that's always an option. http://www.kansan.com/classifieds/  Don't forget Craiglist. Always a last resort site. http://lawrence.craigslist.org/   My now fianc told me he didn't like who I became while drunk and out at bars (we were out together for a friends birthday). I stopped going out with friends to get drunk. It was a huge wakeup call for me and a sign that I needed to grow up.    There's a Hot Box where I live. The lady delivering our order got lost along the way and called me on my cell as she was wondering down the street trying to find our house   It was the only one with outdoor lights on. She acted like she was high as fuck.       For those of us who didn't vote for Brownback we are free to express our opinions...   For all of the years I lived in Newton, I never experienced a storm quite like that.    Tapped the documentary goes in to full detail about this....  HTML://www.tappedthemovie.com/                  Who said anything about minorities?   I meant the city in general, not the high school.                   Looks like a giant mushroom of death.    KS is prime territory for sex slaves, drugs, and violence due to the direct route via the interstate down to Mexico.    There are two KC's...KCKS and KCMO.   Understandable, but this would be of a huge concern for people living in cities such as Wichita, KC and the surrounding areas.            Other states are still looking towards the idea of passing similar bills.   If it the action that the state of KS has taken is considered invalid, what makes those states think they can do the same thing?  Also, what federal law does this go against? (I'm not much of a history buff)       Blackfoot Indian Chief in full gear, waiting for white man to stand up and turn around.    Wearing those clothes weren't and still aren't everyday attire. Fucking racists and their technologies of the olden days.    You're kidding, right?   Ice cream man  The stereotypical pedophile with a twist. Dudes are fucking creepy, even as an adult. If you decide to get some sweet treats this summer, never let them see you walk home, take a different route back.   Same goes for carnies.  Edit: words            Do you work through a temp agency?   If so, it should state on your contract and weekly time sheet that your employer is required to provide you with a lunch break or other breaks.    http://m.ibtimes.com/it-st-paddy-or-patty-5-things-you-should-know-saint-patricks-day-1561891   Fellow Pinckney resident here!   A few shady homes and loud neighbors, but all and all, a great neighborhood.   Best bet in finding a place would be to drive around the area and see what is for rent. There are a few apartment complexes - two of which are owned by the same family - and they are always an option if a home is not available.     Thanks for using the 'dd' and not the 'tt'....as in Paddy's not Patty's.  I am not Irish and it is still annoying.    Every bar on Mass.   Any drinking related day/ holiday + a college town = a lot of specials.  The Replay Lounge has live music all day and 'green beer' (PBR or another cheap beer with green food dye)   He's part cat.   Decided I'd check and see if I could find Founders beer via their site.  Of all the US states that sell Founders, for once I'm happy I live in Kansas.  Too bad the liquor stores are an hour away and I rarely drink.    There's  flu epidemic of sorts throughout the State of Kansas and the U.S.....   The problems on the quiz were vocab words relating to the US Constitution. My boss and I spent days asking him the differences between Federalist and Antifederalist, the Bill of Rights and dozens of other vocab words.   When assigned reading material, we switch off by reading aloud to him and then he'll read a paragraph or two...that requires almost a weeks work and he often still can't comprehend what was read unless we create a graph, table, ect. so that he can make sense of all of the information.   I need to read through his IEP and see if I can get a better idea. There is a lot to know about each student and I am starting to get a better idea as of what I should do.  This is my second month working with students at the high school.   I am neither one. I am in the process of completing undergraduate work before applying to graduate school.   Yes, I know. You are not the first to point that out.   He doesn't want to go to college.    Got the memo already.    I did not expect a lot of karma. Just wanted to share. I was so proud of the student and hoped other people would see that motivation really helps.    He only has the accommodation for Civics.    His IEP specifies certain accommodations. His reading comprehension is low and this helps him pass Civics.     I'm a Title 1 Paraeducator   His IEP specifies certain accommodations.   He answered all 27 questions and only missed 4!    I didn't know how to change the text size :-/.   There are several different SPED departments and I work with students who are Emotionally Disturbed. These students range from having Reactive Attachment Disorder (RAD), Bipolar Disorder, ADHD, a student's father was schizophrenic and the student is quite paranoid and often lashes out, others have Autism (yes, it's real autism, not what people 'think is autism'), and Fetal Alcohol Syndrome.   The kids need our help and would not make it through school without it.   The students I work with are freshman and most are in intermediate classes. They need extra help when it comes to Geometry, Biology and Civics. Also, that's why I challenged my student. I knew he could do it and did not need to accept the teachers accommodation.   I wish I had more time to spend with them. I plan to start working towards a Masters in Art Therapy and Clinical Psychology next year. My career goal is to work with children and adolescents.   My bad. Using certain types of punctuation has never been a strong suit.    Ma'am and thank you! :-)   Check out options through a temp agency....  It was the only way I was able to find a job, even with work experience, and a bachelor's degree.  They provide jobs both part-time and full-time.    If it had a 'collar' it was most likely a dog from the neighborhood, and it's lost, not lose.    Ok?   Smuggling one into the US was easy.  Wrapped mine in perfume covered plastic wrap and put it inside an empty tampon container.  Then I learned that, that does not stop drug dogs from picking up the scent.  Now I have a floral scented Cuban cigar.          If you're the type that doesn't like seeing animals, fish, etc in tight cages or tanks...it would be best to avoid that restaurant.   It's not in Kansas, but the Perot Museum (http://www.perotmuseum.org/) in Dallas, TX has the fossils of all of the dinosaurs on display at the restaurant.   Avoiding First Management would be a great thing to do, but it won't be easy seeing how they own most of Lawrence.           No, but there was a shooting on Iowa...  http://www2.ljworld.com/news/2015/mar/07/rolling-disturbance-shots-fired-reported-iowa-stre/      Knowing that if something were to go wrong, you're bound to be stuck on the streets or lose your house and end up on the streets.

 Just finished it, and yea that was hilarious. Plus the cameos! If you're a fan of new girl, watch!   I saw a trailer for this a year ago plus. Completely forgot about it till now, thank you.   I don't know:( Ive read so many, enjoyed so many...  Maybe The Stand? It was 1200 pages long and it never felt like it. Even books half that size start getting annoying. So,yea, I guess The Stand by Stephen King.     about how I have spent my day. I started off with a lot of activity but now im tired.  School 10-12  Gym 12-1  Haircut  Shower  Wendys  CNN/MSNBC  Now baseball.   I dont even like baseball   Quickest one to do it too   Thank you, already read The Goldfinch, but I didn't know Infinite Playlist was based on a book. Will read! Also, extremely loud sounds very familiar.    $90 million OW. $250 million domestic $780 million WW   It will definitely not surpass Furious 7.    I can see this. Maybe up to fifteen percent more.   I, dont , know how to , use commas. But I do know that I want to read a novel set it modern day NYC. I want subway rides, central park shenanigans, and some sort of protagonist. Thank you.   $195 million.  Avengers rec will stand for a while.   You can talk about smoking here   Where these orders based on luck, or did you work for them?   As a future AG, wow didn't know we could go to Germany.   Is PT3 good?    Well I'm glad the reccomendation got through.  Sometimes books are the best medium for story. Like, imagine that The Stranger was a movie.   How would they show the things he thought?  They just wouldn't be able to.   I guess they could have him narrarate his feelings, but that's lazy.   I guess, to understand the appeal of books, you have to read good books. Books that are special. And "The Stranger" is def special.   Did you end up reading the stranger? I remember being forced to read it in high school, and by the end, it didn't feel like I was forced. I loved it. Crazy that it was written so long ago   That guys never gonna be in a street fight   The Stranger by Albert Camus   The Stand. Post apocalypse the follows the chain of events extremely closely.   Not like they know her name anyways lol   Admitting to LSD I think is auto DQ   World War Z. Kinda. If you judge it as it if it wasn't based on a book then you'll enjoy it.    Amy Smart is so smart   That does make sense. The future hasn't happened so it is written yet. But what keeps fucking with me is that I already know where ill be in a month. In boot camp. So I've lived the last couple months knowing that I would be at a specific place.  Honestly, one of the reasons I signed up for the navy was for this very thing. I hated being in college. Not knowing what the future was gonna be like, but now I know that in two or three years ill be inside some navy ship doing my job. Before I signed up I had no idea.   I guess the future seems more appealing to me. The present is literally right now, and I'm on reddit, drinking beer and watching vobs burgers. This doesn't matter... Like, will I ever look back on this moment?    I need to get on that "less so". Its hard tho, right?   Wasting it. Idk, but I feel like everything I do is pointless because I'm leaving soon. So why do anything? Right now i met someone and it just feels pointless. Why get to know her? I'm gonna be leaving her soon, so what's the point?    Hmmm. Not sure if this is relevant to my post much, but I do write sometimes. Oddly enough, I write time capsule like summaries. Like, to myself. "on 4/2/15 I did this, and I was hoping too". I write these because I'm hoping ill find these amusing in ten years.   I cant help but constantly being in the future. Everything I do, is based on the future. Even this post. As I write it, I'm thinking of the replies and the red envelope.   When I talk to a girl, every little thing becomes a potential snowball. Hmm. She doesn't like action movies... So when we're married, how am I gonna watch new releases?   I'm going to the navy soon, I knew about this eight months ago, and honestly, these months have passed by so quickly and I haven't accomplished anything else beyond waiting. All I do evry day is think about it. I lost eight months of my life. Just waiting.  I quit my job a year ago because I didn't want to be there my whole life.  I forget about the past because it happened already.   Anyone else like this? Any tips?   If you qualify for crypto, go for crypto. Wish I could have had a cleaner record.

Classic cars transforming everywhere.   It might seem unimportant, but if a diverse cast can bring in $147 million opening week, start expecting more films with diverse cast.   The Southern Reach trilogy is exactly what you're looking for. First book is called "Annihilation"   Thank you, I think I like this answer the best. But thank you all for replying.   Don't know if this is going to be long, but here we go.  Basically from what I've retained from secondary education, science documentaries and basic critical thinking I've come to accept evolution like this:  An animal or plant, whichever, mates with a compatible mate. Their offspring takes a little bit of each of the animals. They grow up to eventually have their own offspring. Somehow there is a mistake in the passing down of genes, and the offspring of this animal has brown fur. Peers of this animals find this unattractive and the animal doesn mate.  Generations later this mutation comes up again and this animal mates. passes down his mutation. Then that offspring moves away to a further tree by another river. Generations pass, and another mutation happens, larger feet. It gives this animal superiority, so he takes over. Suddenly generations later this tribe that moved away to this other river has brown fur and big feet, not like their black fur small feet having neighbors. The neighbors meet up at the big feet havers decide to kill the others. Now all animals of this species start carrying the brown fur and big feet genes.  I can keep typing but i guess that this is good enough, so do I understand evolution?   idk why downvotes, it felt like less time to me as well   Of course avengers will, first one was closer to 2 bill than 1   Content: no  Comments? definitely. place is an orgy of scummy young villainy.   Why both NavyFed and USAA? Is their an advantage to having two bank accounts?   No ones telling you why not, its because they are looking for candidates with STEM degrees and above 3.0 gpas. Liberal arts degrees dont get much cred sadly   I say skip this. Read the first one and was severely dissapointed.   Theres this series on amazon kindle which is dirt cheap and action packed "Terms of Enlistment"    go to navy.com and look at all the enlisted jobs. If you see at least three that look interesting to you go and talk to a recruiter.    I spent a while on the Wind Up Bird Chronicle and during the first two thirds it was worth it, but when I reached the end I felt like I wasted my time. Dont think ill visit his work again.   That's a pretty large margin though   Sam Mendes is wonderful and so are his movies. Revolutionary Road might be the most depressing films ever.   Including marketing, not bad. The craze has been dead for a while, but its not like people forgot they used to play these games.   Only of they're funny   Scott Ackerman   Your bar for comedy is low, that's not really a joke, just a simple analogy.   Night Film by Marissha Pessl. If you like cinema at all you'll like it. Its pretty dark.   $1.05 billion my estimate   Hmm, didn't know that about the overseas economies. Still think it has a chance.   Fast and Furious 6 hit $788 million.  Paul Walker tragically passed away.  The trailer is fucking bonkers.  The previews are hype.  No way it doesn't hit a billion.   That is one of the best scenes ever   Breakfast of Champions by Kurt Vonnegut    What with the dancing? It was pretty much the same. There was a difference in the gambling tho   You don't just trade your Bachelors in for a commission, you have to stand out, be competitive.  	62
 I'm not talking about aching muscles. After a long strenuous ride I often get a bit of a headache and feel a bit rough for the rest of the day. If it's been a bit cold it takes ages to warm back up no matter what I do. It's probably a preparation thing or maybe just an occupational hazard... Any tips?   UPDATE: Thanks for the advice everyone - I'm pretty sure I drink and eat enough while riding but it sounds like I need to make more of an effort to think about what I eat and drink afterwards and force myself to rehydrate even if I don't feel thirsty. Really helpful thank you!    Aww busted... no you're right I strode in here with a generic tale of how men meet women every minute of every day but I didn't actually use the exact details of a particular story. DAMN LYING SJW!!!   Ooo Ooo I know this one. So once right, my friend was at a party and he met this woman and then he waited until he was introduced and then he asked her about herself and was genuinely interested in her responses. He talked to her like she was a human being not a conquest or a prize to be won and then at the end of the evening when it became obvious that there was chemistry between them he asked her for her number. He was totally willing to accept that if she said no that wasn't because she was a bad person, just that she wasn't interested in him, but she said yes and told him to get in touch.  Then he text her, remembering that she'd said she liked quirky cocktail bars and invited her to one. When they got there he talked to her like a human being some more.  It worked so well that eventually SHE made a move on HIM. And he was grown up enough to realise this wasn't in anyway emasculating.  I don't how he does it, man...

 Meat is different colors due to the muscle useage in the animal. Dark red muscle is used for endurance type activities, while pink muscle (white meat) is used for burst movement. Since cows do a lot of standing and walking (endurance) they are red, and chickens dont fly often and therefor are white (needed for a fast escape). The color is due to a protein.

 Didn't Karl Pilkington find one of those in the wild during his climb of Mt Fuji?    So that one was actually malicious, but this one is just simple dipshitery.    [Lol, like this?] (http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1034314/)    I don't think that incompetence suggests malice.    Some fully formed organs. Not all of them are fully formed. Especially not the brain which is what we consider to be the most human of them all.    This comes across as incompetence to me.    So in other words the governor doesn't understand how the process works and no one in his office explained it to him.    Okay. So you're not a creationist. No one really cares about this sort of stuff. That's your personal belief and it doesn't affect anything or anyone else. When you start trying to substitute actual* science with those beliefs is when we have a problem.    How is standing for rule of law "anti-cop"?    You might remember Baptist as the denomination of Christianity that prides itself in not aggressively proselytizing at every possible opportunity.  What?    You're allowed to believe whatever you want. Just understand that it's in no way science and has no place in a discussion about science.    Are you trying to say that /r/coontown and other subs like it need exposure in order to exist because that's not really true. Most of these controversial subs get most of their traffic through word of mouth. If users don't log in they can't vote, post, or comment so who cares about them. People who opt out of seeing this side of reddit will miss out on a lot more than just a few hateful subs. Most people will want to see at least some of that content so this isn't going to exclude enough people to directly kill any of those communities.   This wouldn't necessarily hurt any subs, but it will allow reddit to isolate that content and sell ad space for better or worse.    Because their unions lobby against decriminalization and legalization, and to increase criminal penalties so that their industry will continue to grow.    Yep. I agree wholeheartedly.    He was born again and very religious before he died. Christ forgives all sins. That would have to include drilling a hole in a teenage boys head and filling it with acid in an attempt to create a mindless sex slave. Go figure.          *Incarcerated  So basically the NYPD is just arresting people for no good reason. This is sickening. Almost every employee in a job that requires manual labor benefits from having a simple lock blade on their belt.    Of course he felt threatened. There was a defiant suspect in his presence. It didn't matter that she was a tiny teenage girl in handcuffs. He was fearful for his safety. She could have said something to really hurt his feelings. Teenage girls can be really mean. Especially when they've been drinking.                   Oh, my bad. I didn't realize that it was wrong to expect people to behave with any sort of integrity or honesty.    Ahh. Well, it was still appropriate so, no harm no foul.    And your male teenagers.    Anti fracking? How is that antiscience? You'd have to be an idiot to support a company whose operations are causing cluster cancer, earthquakes, contaminated drinking water, and flooding your streets with toxic waste. Opposing this shit is antiscience? That's rich. So now anything that opposes the operations and therefore profits of major corporations is antiscience? That's a very special perspective you have.    The creationist argument is the definition of idiotic and ignorant denial of science.    What are you trying to say? That Republicans are more likely to accept the scientific concensus that Democratic voters? If you're talking about the antivaccination movement you should do a bit of research. Those assholes are split very evenly across political ideologies with a slight increase as a person becomes more conservative.    What do you want me to do, go through every state's legal definition until I find one that doesn't define corrections officers as law enforcement so you can be right? Literally every source and authority I've looked at defines corrections officers as law enforcement. You're in the minority. No one else is arguing your case. Just give it up already.    I think a better argument would be that profit is not automatically and always a good thing.    The thing is iirc, he invited a bunch of these people to the award ceremony.    Apparently, on top of being in exact opposition of everyone else on this topic, you have a reading comprehension problem.    You're right. But I'm surrounded by Christians and they believe that Jeffrey Dahmer is in heaven right now.    This is probably why they don't travel abroad.    What? This isn't an argument. I'm not supporting the war on drugs. I'm explaining why your post was removed.    That's funny. I usually look at Dahmer as an argument against religion. According to the tenets of Christianity Dahmer should be in heaven with god and Jesus right now doing whatever he wants for all of eternity. But everyone outside of Christianity will burn in eternal hell fire. That's a lot of good, decent people suffering forever.    From the wiki:  During this period, Robinson cultivated and maintained the outward appearance of a community-minded citizen and family man; he became a Scoutmaster, a baseball coach and a Sunday school teacher. In 1977 he talked his way onto the board of directors of a localcharitable organizationand forged a series of letters from its executive director to the mayor of Kansas City, and from the mayor to other civic leaders, commending his generous volunteer efforts and generally singing his praises. Eventually he had himself named the organization's Man of the Year, and threw a festive awards luncheon in his own honor.  He was an* accomplished fraud.    There's also the fact that one study doesn't "prove" anything. It's completely possible that another study could have entirely different results.    I disagree. I think it's obvious that religious freedom for Christians means that only Christians should be free to practice their religion.    Pretty obvious sock puppet.    https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/5/8401  **(17)the term law enforcement officer means**  (A)an employee, the duties of whose position  (i)are primarily  (I)the investigation, apprehension, or detention of individuals suspected or convicted of offenses against the criminal laws of the United States, or  (II)the protection of officials of the United States against threats to personal safety; and  (ii)are sufficiently rigorous that employment opportunities should be limited to young and physically vigorous individuals, as determined by the Director considering the recommendations of the employing agency;  (B)an employee of the Department of the Interior or the Department of the Treasury (excluding any employee under subparagraph (A)) who occupies a position that, but for the enactment of the Federal Employees Retirement System Act of 1986, would be subject to the District of Columbia Police and Firefighters Retirement System, as determined by the Secretary of the Interior or the Secretary of the Treasury, as appropriate;  (C)an employee who is transferred directly to a supervisory or administrative position after performing duties described in subparagraph (A) and (B) for at least 3 years; and  **(D)an employee**  **(i)of the Bureau of Prisons or Federal Prison Industries, Incorporated;**  **(ii)of the Public Health Service assigned to the field service of the Bureau of Prisons or of the Federal Prison Industries, Incorporated; or**  (iii)in the field service at Army or Navy disciplinary barracks or at any other confinement and rehabilitation facility operated by any of the armed forces;  whose duties in connection with individuals in detention suspected or convicted of offenses against the criminal laws of the United States or of the District of Columbia or offenses against the punitive articles of the Uniform Code of Military Justice (chapter47of title10) require frequent direct contact with these individuals in their detention and are sufficiently rigorous that employment opportunities should be limited to young and physically vigorous individuals, as determined by the head of the employing agency;     "I hate them for who they love so they should be marginalized and discriminated against."    That's garbage. Posting an article in this sub does not equal a complete endorsement or agreement of its contents.   I never said they should be disbarred. You can create whatever narrative you like, but it won't change anything.    Well, they're certainly not supporting religious freedom. They're pushing their own special brand of McMorality.    The courts have ruled that civil servants do not have the same rights as normal citizens during the performance of their duties and sometimes even during their personal time. Whether you agree with this or not is irrelevant.   I didn't say that they should be disbarred. I suggested that there were possibly ethics violations that should be investigated. But, on reddit you're not allowed to be wrong without hordes upon hordes descending upon you to call you names and tell you that you're wrong.    I'm warning you, this thread is not going to be friendly to your opinion.    This is terrible. What kind of scumbag would listen to scientologists regarding mental heath issues.    No they're not. They're just assholes.    Yeah. That's right. Are you okay?    Please don't tell me what to do.    And how were the movements OWS/Ferguson/Baltimore illegal. And don't tell me that the movements were illegal because of a few bad actors because that's bullshit.    Oh they can. They'll just be fired. Civil disobedience is not a protected right. I don't know why you would think that it was.    Well you joke, but this amounts to more than just inconvenience. We used to have multiple arts and crafts stores here. They were family owned businesses. I was actually close with the family that owned the Ben Franklin. Things did not work out well for them.    Yeah. I remember those days just a couple of years ago. People were so free. Insurers were* free to deny children coverage because of existing conditions. Insurers were free to wait for a premium holder to file a large claim and then dropped them for something as simple as failing to report every childhood cavity or acne. You're right. Freedom is great isn't it? /s   Whether or not it's legal, it's certainly a dick move and it basically means that I and other artists and crafters in my area must drive two hours away or order everything online.    That's what I thought too, but the attorney in this thread said that oath is unenforceable.    With the new executive order that's not necessary anymore.    Thank you /u/in_yo_mouth for having the strength and courage to make everyone's contraceptive decisions for them. Next will you decide which shitty school we're allowed to send our kids to once a condom breaks?    Not to mention that they basically put all other arts and crafts stores out of business while simultaneously carrying a majority of hokey Christian related products and refusing to carry anything that might be from other religions or philosophies. Talk about freedom!   This is just poetically hypocritical.    Absolutely. But the executive order should sufficiently remove the employer from the equation.    I think you answered your own question.    You're right. The Supreme Court allowed employers to opt out, the executive signed an order allowing third party insurance to pay for it. Now employees can get the medicine they need and employers can butt-out.   Edit: added a comma.    Did you even read the fucking article?    It's been explained to me that there's no precedent for disbarring either of these politicians. But if they were investigated it would be for violating the ethical guidelines defined by their respective licensing bodies, not for their political offices.    Apparently. Please go away.    My point is that the oath is unenforceable. But I don't care either way. I'm not arguing for impeachment. Why don't you bring your argument to /u/firstamendanon? He/she is a lawyer and can answer your questions.   In the meanwhile, please refrain from insulting me personally.    An attorney takes the same oath that a politician takes in regards to upholding the law and the constitution. The lawyer in this thread said it's unenforceable.    Am I a criminal if I leave my car parked by the meter for too long?    Disobeying federal cannabis laws.    Right. But they do it all of the damn time. It recently came out that Rick Perry is on the payroll of the biggest donor to his superpac. Unless they were literally standing in front of a camera, how do you prove coordination or collusion? It's unenforceable garbage.    What the hell are you talking about?    Elected officials have a right to free expression. By your logic, nearly every elected official in Colorado should be impeached.    Luckily he'll never get the chance to do anything to the country.    You're right. I've become far more liberal in the last 15 years.    Correct.    You can at least stabilize the head, apply a compress, and proceed to rush the victim to an emergency department. But I guess if you are a police officer who shot someone, you want to be certain that they will die, so you do nothing.    I agree. This could very well solve a lot of the problems we're having with the police in this country.    A cop confiscating your camera and arresting you is not a passive act.    The sheriff said he was not happy to have to continue paying Bagnall a salary that he estimated to be in the high 40s until the case was resolved.  Theres a victim in this case ... and sometimes the system stinks, Bartlett said.  Were very proud of the job we do here, and this is not something we take lightly, The sheriff added. I was extremely disappointed in his actions, and he will never again set foot in this building, unless he goes to jail.  Good on the sheriff for turning this dirt bag out on his ass. Hopefully he'll do some real time for this.      Well, it would need to be more organized than that. Someone would have to write some legislation so it can be presented at the state or federal level.    You don't arrest criminals. The police are far too cowardly for that. You pick on kids and vulnerable people for smoking pot or being black. You take kick backs from or just steer clear of actual criminals.    I wonder where those god awful pigs from PnS are on this one? I wonder why they're not here to explain "how we don't know the whole story yet" or some shit like that.    Is that what you call it when the professional board that issued your license questions your ethics?    Omg, they actually cited that user even though he admitted that he was lying when he said he took that photo. What a bunch of assholes.    Holy shit. So aside from beating and killing innocent people the police are also ignoring and humiliating the victims of violent crimes? We don't need them.       You may be right about segregation being the basis of most Jim Crow laws, but understand that you're arguing that Ted Cruz is not unlike those tortured souls who fought for equal rights and treatment while he, in fact, argues against the equal rights and treatment of another group. And it's still true that there was much about the Jim Crow south that can not be explained by "separate but equal".    lawless  [law-lis]   adjective  1. contrarytoorwithoutregardforthelaw: lawlessviolence.  2. beingwithoutlaw;uncontrolledbyalaw;unbridled;unruly;unrestrained: lawlesspassion.  3. illegal: bootleggers'lawlessactivity.     My favorite part is how Forbes says he's worth more like $4.1 billion.   Can you read?   Edit: I posted an article. That doesn't mean that it represents my views entirely and I didn't write the damn thing. Yesterday I posted an article that explained Santorum's position on a constitutional amendment that would ban gay marriage. I sure as hell don't agree with that man about anything.    First commenter, whoever you are you may be shadowbanned. You can find out at /r/shadowban.                Not all of them. That only applies to segregation. Jim Crow was much worse than just segregation.    The livelihood? He's a publicly paid elected official. It's also worth pointing out that he's made it his personal political mission to go after families he doesn't identify or agree with.   Edit: It's also worth noting that he supports employers having the right to deny someone a job or terminate them on the basis of their sexual orientation, and businesses having the right to deny service or products to someone on the same basis.    So you're saying that Bernie Sanders should be in prison for allowing cannabis to be decriminalized in his jurisdiction?    The public employees who refuse to obey the law and perform their duties should be terminated by their immediate supervisors or the next elected official up.    I wasn't advancing the argument that they should be disbarred. I asked a simple question.    You're probably right, but at the very least it makes them hypocrites.    But this article and this discussion are referring to these politicians professional legal licenses. Otherwise what would we be talking about?    When did Senator Sanders obtain a professional license that could be scrutinized or revoked?    What do you call officers of the court and elected officials instructing public employees to disobey the law and refuse to perform their duties?    We already pay for the utility. Just like every other public and private service. There's no reason why we should have to pay for their mistakes as well as suffer the consequences of them.   Then the individual himself is held responsible.    It's not the victim's family making these claims. It's the owner of the mobile home park and therefore the surveillance cameras that caught the footage.    Yes he was. He was not a public employee, and he was not an American so anything he said or did is not applicable here, and I think it's more than ridiculous to compare Senator Cruz to Ghandi.    How is advising public employees to disobey the law and refuse to do their jobs civil disobedience? Public employees are not private citizens during the performance* of their duties. This sounds more like "professional disobedience" or in other words, "insubordination" and grounds for termination.    Yeah, third party is what I'm talking about. I don't know about you, but most of the people I've spoken to would prefer if taxpayers were liable in any way for the actions of these employees. It's bad enough that we have to pay for their salaries and their equipment. It's unconscionable we should have to pay when they brutalize or kill us too.    Don't know. I doubt it, but it would surprise me if no attorney has ever faced sanctions for endorsing lawlessness.       No, public employees refusing to obey the law and do their jobs is not civil disobedience. A licensed attorney and public official advising public employees to disobey the law is not civil disobedience. And even if it is, civil disobedience has never been protected by law. If you need examples of this look at all of the people brutalized during Occupy Wallstreet, the Ferguson and Baltimore protests, or any other protest in US history.    It would have to be paid for by the individual. Cops would have to cooperate just as nurses, doctors, contractors, truck drivers, etc.    So then it's just meaningless. Because murder for hire is extremely rare and overall murder rates are unaffected by capital punishment.    So you don't have a source.   Because what I'm saying is that Jim Crow laws were unconstitutional and once challenged they were thrown out by the applicable courts including SCOTUS. An attorney should not be telling anyone to break the law, but they can render an opinion on whether a statute is lawful and constitutional. In this case the SCOTUS has already determined the constitutionality of same sex marriage. Senator Cruz knows the law. He's not rendering an opinion, he's advising public employees to disobey the law which is very clear.    He wasn't so that didn't happen.   But, I suppose if he possessed a license to practice law and violated the bar's ethics guidelines it would need to be investigated and he would possibly face sanctions.   Edit: grammar    I understand that the author of the article said disbarred, but I said investigated.   Where those Jim Crowe laws upheld by the SCOTUS? Do you have a source that suggests they were?   Because, from what I understand your hypothetical is the exact opposite of history. Politicians and lawyers were mostly supportive of the oppressive policies, or in other words, the exact same position as Cruz and friends. It took the Supreme Court to overturn those unconstitutional laws and the established powers were resistant to those changes.       A licensed attorney is supposed to maintain a certain amount of professionalism and respect for the law. Actively advising public employees to disobey the law is questionable at best, and at the least worthy of professional scrutiny.    Admitting you're wrong is the first step to addressing any mistake.    See the other conversation that started at this comment.    I'm talking about them breaking the ethics rules regarding their licenses. We're not just talking about disagreeing with a political policy. These men have advised the public to break the law. There's nothing immoral about LGBT marriage, but it's certainly immoral to discriminate against* and marginalize those you dislike or disagree with.    Yep. Nurses have the same requirements, and they don't even carry guns.    Good argument for them to relinquish their licenses. Thanks.    That'd be great. I've been pushing this idea for a while now. The only person to argue with me was a cop, but it's obvious why he'd rather the state carry the liability for his fuck ups.    No, they should be investigated for advising people to break the law while possessing a very specific professional license. What's the point in this type of license if it doesn't regulate certain types of behavior?    I would argue that some people would prefer to not be relegated to the status of second class citizen. You know that whole "separate but equal" thing?    Even better solution; require all officers to carry a professional license and professional liability insurance. If an individual cop fucks up he will find himself uninsurable, without a license, and therefore out of a job.    Or at the very least have their licenses investigated and possibly be disbarred.    Maybe we taxpayers should do something to ensure that the police will stop killing us.    And if it's never released to the public would you just believe the police narrative?    I'd like those assholes from PnS to explain this one.    A licensed attorney should not be advising people to break the law. Most likely nothing will come of it, but it is worth pointing out.    Believe it or not, [he actually is being charged with conspiracy and obstruction among other things.] (http://6abc.com/news/philadelphia-police-officer-charged-after-being-shot/851157/)    Flash grenade to the face.    He was killed for contempt of cop.          What happened to the natives is/was terrible. But I hardly think it's appropriate to compare them to a conversation about wildlife management. Killing and destroying a population of people is hardly the same thing as mismanaging a species of herd animals.   	142
       Gaaah I knew I should have cut McCarthy on my fantasy team this week.   Also, I think we can call this year the curse of the MacMath. A young, but constantly improving goalkeeper suddenly had the rug pulled from under him and the Union have had keeper (and winning) problems ever since.    Jihad is not part of the five pillars of Islam. Fasting, prayer, Hajj, the declaration of faith, and charity are the five. I don't know where you got Jihad from.   I confused Black September with the PFLP, a Marxist Palestinian group. My apologies. However, Black September was still secular and not particularly motivated by religion.       I have been. They lied to me then, just as you are now.  You're only lying to yourself. You have a confirmation bias. You will only believe negative items about Islam. I wish you peace, and I sincerely hope you find it.         I feel the most useful public discourse would challenge Geller to organize an event that lampooned both Jesus and Muhammed.  Muslims are also forbidden from depicting Jesus, or any other prophet of God. So Muslims would likely shy way from any kind of event, as was the case here, as the only two protesters at the event were these two people.    Your source is non-academic and biased. Taiqiyya is only to be used when one's life is in danger, and has historically been associated with Shi'a Muslims, who concealed their faith to avoid physical harm. I'm not lying to you, and it would be a sin for me to do so. Google that Quranic verse on non-compulsion in religion (which you ignored) if you don't believe me.    So you're in a minority. Or, you're lying. Either way, what do I care?  Ah, there we are. Your mind is closed. No matter what you learn or who you meet, you would stubbornly remain prejudiced against Islam and Muslims.    Muslims like myself are the majority of the world's Muslims. As loud as the extremists may be, their attacks are isolated and don't spark that massive war between Muslims and "The West" (this doesn't make sense because many Muslims live in the West and consider themselves Western). I've attended many mosques and gatherings of different interpretations of Islam, from Sufi to Shia to even Salafi, and have never heard of imposition.    Facts define Muslims. A poll determines facts. If you believe those facts are in error, it is incumbent on you to demonstrate it, not just throw your hands in the air and claim you don't believe polls. You'd do just as well saying you don't believe in math.  Well, I'd suggest you show up to a mosque and sincerely and politely ask questions. It doesn't seem like you've ever met any Muslims. I'd sit down and talk with you, but as I mentioned before, you seem a bit closed minded, plus you'd probably physically attack me or something.   I hope you find the truth, or at least, lose your hostility. Peace be unto you.     No, I've heard it used by Muslims talking about extremists espousing Salafi ideals, especially those prejudiced against minority religious sects.     Yes, you implicitly did, just as the author of the article did, by implying that Geller's personality in any way whatsoever justified the response of attempted murder   We clearly didn't read the same article, as Ali condemned the attackers, saying that Islam says to ignore them. There were no protesters at the exhibition, except the two attackers. The large Dallas-area Muslim community mostly stayed away. The writer in no way says that Geller's personality incited or justified the murder.   By accusing me of implicitly supporting their actions, you're attempting to read my mind. Neither was justified in their actions, in my opinion. Geller's same "free speech" stance is undermined by the fact that she campaigned against Al Jazeera's launching a network in the United States.    I think you'd be surprised if you looked at Muslims and gun ownership in Texas. Most, especially those of an immigrant background, do not own guns.   **EDIT**: Thank you to /u/espitatic for changing "Muslims" to "ISIS" in the above comment.    A poll is supposed to define Muslims? I am a Muslim and in none of the mosques I've attended have I ever heard of anyone preaching that Islam should be imposed on anyone. Extremism exists, but it is called extremism because *it is beyond the pale and outside of the mainstream.* It not only flies in the face of religion practiced by the vast majority of its one-billion plus adherents, but also in Islamic history.    People like to take verses of the Quran out of context. Well, see what you can do with this one:   "Let there be no compulsion in religion." - Quran 2:256.    We're talking about the writer of this article, not the attackers.    Where did you get the idea that the reasonableness of depicting the Prophet was an argument? Or that anyone was justifying lethal force aside from ISIS and fellow extremists? Where has that argument been raised in this piece?       Haha, I think Wade Barrett told Jericho that when Jericho was his "pro" during the first season of NXT.    Can you seriously not distinguish between ISIS and the other billion-plus Muslims around the world?     Wasn't the Munich massacre 42 years ago?  That was a Marxist group who was responsible.     In fact, they probably "support" the muslim extremists, inasmuch as they probably think we should give up our free speech so as not to antagonize them.  You're pulling that out of thin air. "OMG he's criticizing the cartoons he must want to appease ISIS" is some zero-sum nonsense.     Finally, I'm not really interested in hearing veiled justifications for the attacks based on the personality of one of the people involved in the exhibit. Apologising for people who attempted murder because they were offended by some cartoons is frankly disgusting.   Where on earth are you getting that idea? Nobody is apologizing for any attack. Based on your comments and seeming support for Geller, I could make a similar argument that your condemnation for Anders Brevlik's massacre is nowhere to be found either.    **Submission Statement**  The shootings in Garland, Texas over an exhibition of cartoons depicting Prophet Muhammad helped extremists as well as bigots with their narrative: that "Islam is at war with the West."  To quote the writer: "These ideological extremists are two faces of the same coin; they have a symbiotic relationship strengthened and sustained by the others toxic absolutism."                  Add Otunga to that.   I read that in David Spade's voice.   All of them dated Susie, too.    Nah, you just have to get a special glove like Donkey Kong.   THEN Luke Harper.    Bork Bobland.    Probably because Pete (we think) tipped him off.    I think you mean /u/AKATheMaskedMan.     The Masked Man (David Shoemaker, /u/AKATheMaskedMan), before going to Grantland, had his column at Deadspin, a Gawker property. To say they are no friends of the industry is a massive generalization.          You don't want to have a nationality NOT named after a family?    Yet again, Vince doesn't think foreigners can be the top faces.    Eva Marie!   I should have addressed this in my comment. The kafala system is crap and is a form of slavery.

The street shawarma in NYC is world-famous. Steinway Street in Queens and Atlantic Avenue are full of them. In the D.C., I know of a few Arab restaurants in Georgetown and Northern Virginia that are supposed to be good.   Have you ever been to New York and parts of D.C.? Plenty of Arab restaurants there.     Arabs are late immigrants to the United States,  Except in Michigan.    You should be able to get it in Chicago; there's a sizeable Arab community there from what I've heard.       On the contrary, at least it shows original reporting by each outlet. Granted, they all could be wrong, but at least the PR firms aren't winning the information war, right?    But does Bielefeld actually exist? That's what concerns me.          That's an interesting point.    That requires a new pro contract, which might not work with salary caps, etc.    Also Soony Saad and Justin Meram.    Soony Saad and Justin Meram are from Michigan. Both are pros, both are Arab-American and both play for Lebanon and Iraq respectively.    They support most of Hezbollah's stances but aren't the party's base.    I saw this on WrestleCrap years ago. Still wondering what Tiny Tim was doing on a wrestling show.    I've read elsewhere that those areas are primarily Shia and are pretty much AMAL's constituency since Hezbollah won't back weed farming. AMAL is allied with Hezbollah though.

Can someone please leak one of the drafts of the TPP?       Nobody is attacking you or anyone for being successful.

Kevin Eck was a journalist with the Baltimore Sun and left them for a creative job with WWE. His name was even on WWE.com a lot. You can Google it, it's true.      LOBIENA or SLOBINA   Oh good, nobody got Matt Damon.    Dolo used to do this with the national team on occasion.    He was on Jericho's podcast, actually.      Rock's St. Louis comments remind me of this: http://deadspin.com/cardinals-fans-get-ugly-in-clash-with-ferguson-proteste-1643282285   What did Adam Jones do?     Rock's entire rant is simply the populist pules of a racist.  It's the monologue of a comedian. You seem to have missed the humor in it. Rock is no more a racist than you are, unless you see criticism of anything white as racist.    Looking through the comments here, no one seems to be addressing Rock's point about the lily-white crowds.    It is a big deal, it's a historically black college.   EDIT: I was wrong, it is Stillman.   He's a stand-up comedian, think of it as a riff or ribbing.    Because everybody watches football just to see the halftime show.     when they reject it you can't blame MLB  I'm pretty sure you can if they aren't succeeding. Maybe they are just bad programs that need fixing.    Bob Dylan was very pro-civil rights, incidentally. See his song "Hurricane."   I loved that hop he used to do out of the batter's box after hitting a home run, and that peace sign/kiss thing in the dugout. Of course, I hate him for his contribution to that horrible Orioles collapse in 2005.     By that metaphor, Estadio Azteca would be destroyed at the end.       Seattle fans don't dominate this subreddit. I've been here for a few years and can confidently say so.

No, you mostly get pity.       As I also said above, he's also from Mercer Island, a very wealthy community, and I can't imagine his parents put much stock in a professional athlete's career. Thus, there probably is a lot of pressure on him to get his college degree before signing any contract, foreign or domestic.

 Is this question related to this article/research? http://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/23/science/aphantasia-minds-eye-blind.html?_r=0  Because I have a hard time picturing things, even faces of people that I see daily.  I just get a vague sense of what they look like, not a complete image.  I wish I could access the researchers' survey and see how I compare with the rest of the population.   In addition to the outline idea (which is way more important than a lot of people realize) I have friends who swear by starting out their results section by choosing and creating/prettying up the figures and tables that will go into it.  If you don't like writing and/or are a more visual person, this is a way to start thinking about the important parts of your findings and what they mean before you have to start cranking out a lot of words.  You kind of sneak yourself in the back door of writing the thesis.  Edit: also, I'm sorry to hear that this has been such a difficult time period for you.  I hope you are able to finish things up and move on to something happier and better!   Since they did their experiments with adults, I'm not sure how the researchers are ruling out that instinctive tendency to cooperate has been suppressed by learning/cultural influences.  Edit: I think part of the issue is with the headline.  In psychology, at least, it appears that "intuition" and "instinct" are NOT the same thing.  Instinct is innate behavior, something one is born with.  "Intuition" has to do with subconscious thought processes that are still related to experience or learned information. http://cogsci.stackexchange.com/questions/767/difference-between-instinct-and-intuition  The researchers did not directly show anything about instinct; they looked at subconscious vs. conscious decision-making in inexperienced and experienced people. (Similar to what /u/dont_press_ctrl-W notes.)   I actually think they don't have to be mutually exclusive.  For example, scratching a rash is both a reaction to the symptoms, and something that might exacerbate those symptoms.   What if it were just a sentence or two on why the poster finds it interesting or surprising?  I'm sure that would be rife with other problems I'm not thinking of . . .    A lot of snail species are hermaphrodites; some of these species have to take turns playing the "male" and female" roles with a partner, so that they can both reproduce.  http://scienceline.ucsb.edu/getkey.php?key=2578   This is a little bit skewed.  The average age of onset is 18 in men and 25 in women; that's past puberty, and particularly for women is well past the age one might begin smoking.  In addition, the research specifically looked at whether smoking behavior predated the schizophrenia diagnosis, and part of their argument is from the cases in which it does.  The researcher is trying to suggest that we should look into nicotine use as something that might influence the tendency to develop schizophrenia.  If the association continues to hold up in other studies, it would be one more reason to encourage people not to smoke.   i agree with your general message here, but I wouldn't say it's "barely a study."  It's a meta-analysis of 61 other studies.  There are some drawbacks to combining data from studies done at different times and on different populations, but it also gives you a lot more data to work with, so that it's easier to see broad patterns.   I think the word "influence" would be more clear than "cause."  Schizophrenia has a multifactorial cause; genetics and environment both play a role.  What the researchers are suggesting, and trying to encourage further investigation of, is that if an individual has some predisposing factors to schizophrenia, smoking could be something that pushes them further toward diagnosable disease.  My institution doesn't give me online access to the journal that published the original work, otherwise I would try to comment on the statistics that lead them to state that they can distinguish self-medicating behavior from smoking as a risk factor; but they do state that they are aware of this confound.   I wonder why the authors didn't say "kin recognition"?   In case it's confusing, "discrimination" in this context just means an organism treating its close relatives differently from other organisms of the same species. The word doesn't have the negative connotation that it does in human society.  In this case, bacteria are shown to evolve the ability to recognize closely related strains and share space with them, while not sharing space with unrelated colonies.   "Clearly most smokers do not develop schizophrenia, but the researchers believe it is increasing the risk.  The overall incidence of the condition is one in every 100 people normally, which may be increased to two per 100 by smoking."  This is a much better representation of the findings than the title used here.   https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/3coa1l/animals_can_coordinate_neural_activity_to_perform/csxdbna   I guess it depends on what you mean by favorite, but in terms of accurate portrayal, Cathy Ames from *East of Eden.*  I also like the reader is encouraged to feel some compassion for her, since she is described as someone born with a disability or deficiency, although an emotional rather than a physical one.   I think a tattoo is plenty noticeable, but as you note, information can change.  Phone numbers, but also your medical needs or history could eventually change; you might want someone other than your parents as an emergency contact, etc.   I know there's a lot of literature out there on this, but because you seem like you had a really good experience, and are excited to share: what did you do to teach yourself to toe-strike?  Did you do strengthening exercises to help retrain yourself?  Did you do anything (videotaping, etc.) to look at your stride?  How long did it take to start feeling natural?  	16
 Yessir. I will make it happen.   I try to do a bit of both. Women are 51% of the population, so they should be represented as much (if not 1% more) than men. There are a lot of instances where I just don't specify the gender so the reader can fill in the blanks. It doesn't work in all cases, though. When I can't, I try to cycle between dudes and dudettes.   Last week, I spotted a chilling headline hidden in my community newspaper. It was nested deep within its pages, between an article on tree pollination and a call for submissions on plumbing services --- the kind of mind-numblingly boring stuff people tend to skip over. Normally, I would have missed it, but my bus was stuck in a nasty traffic jam, and the paper was my only means of distraction. That's why the eerie headline caught my attention. It read:  *The Human Library  This Weekend Only!*  The words *Human Library* stuck out like a rusted nail in a children's playground, evoking a feeling of paranoid dread. I envisioned a mad scientist showing off his unethical collection of partially-dissected human remains. Perhaps some of his victims were still alive, unable to move or speak, but were screaming for help on the inside. The horrible thought sent a shiver down my spine. However, when I read the description accompanying the headline, I realized the event wasn't quite as sinister as its name suggested. *The Human Library* was a pilot project run by the local library where regular people from various professions were invited to sit down and answer questions. Think of it as a career fair, without the recruitment aspect. You could essentially "borrow" a human to learn about their life. It was an intriguing idea, and I figured it'd be the perfect activity to do with my kid sister.  When Saturday morning came, my little sister ran excitedly into my room to wake me. She was already dressed and ready to go, whipping her library card back and forth while squealing something in a tone so high-pitch that I couldn't make out the words. I replied by throwing my pillow at her face and rolling over to doze off. Unfortunately, I left myself open for retaliation. I'll spare you the gory details, but I should have known better than to give my only weapon to a hyperactive seven-year-old. The one-sided pillow fight that ensued would have given PTSD to even the toughest of men.  When we arrived at the library, we followed the signage to a large conference room at the back of the building. A bunch of families were already roaming about, speaking to the different guests. None was busier than the table in the far corner, which, as far as I could see, featured a firefighter. He wasn't wearing the full uniform: just a shirt with a logo on it. It would have been unreasonable to expect him to wear the undoubtedly hot get-up all day long. Judging by the flock of children fawning over his every word, and single mothers gawking at his stupidly muscular body, I could tell his choice of attire hadn't negatively impacted him whatsoever.  My sister, who was dressed as Princess Anna because kids have absolutely no shame wearing costumes in public even if it isn't Halloween, tugged on my shirt, and pointed to the firefighter. *Typical*, I thought. Firefighters and other "heroes" were like catnip for kids.  "Y'know, big brother is so much cooler than that guy," I told my sis, as I tried to steer her towards another guest.  She snickered and nudged me playfully, "You're so jelly you've got peanut butter belly! Jelly jelly peanut butter belly!"   "You make a good point," I relented, unable to come up with a proper comeback to the amazing burn she'd dished out.  If she wanted to be like every other stereotypical kid, then so be it. I; however, had no intention of being the only guy standing in a crowd of kids and moms. It would have been awkward and creepy, so I explored the other tables while she had her fun.  Having never been particularly comfortable around large groups, I gravitated towards the only unoccupied table. Behind it stood a large, burly man wearing a stained beige apron. His arms were crossed high above his chest, feeding the already hostile energy emanating form him. Strong, callused fingers scratched at his bearded chin. When he looked at me, he seemed to sneer at my admittedly inferior form. I felt my throat tighten, my muscles tense, and my head retreat towards my shoulders.  "S-so," I started, my voice crackling, "  W-what do *you* do?"  The man shifted his weight, then leaned forward, slamming his massive hands against the table firmly, "I'm a butcher," he replied, his tone sharp and authoritative.  Even when leaning, the man towered over me like a Neanderthal warrior. I could feel sweat collecting on my forehead, like dew on a dandelion. Compared to him, I was probably just as frail as one, too.  "Uhn  what  what do you like about your job?" I questioned uncomfortably.  He smirked lightly, barely giving the question any thought, "Watching the animals take their final breaths."  The twisted gleam of enjoyment in his eyes made me shiver uncontrollably, "O-oh."  "Especially the calves," he continued, though I wish he hadnt, "It's almost as though *they know* what's going to happen to them. Their fear makes them even more tender and juicy," he answered, still smirking deviously.  Meanwhile, I could hear the kids around the firefighter screaming "ME! ME! ME!" excitedly. At least *they* were having fun.  I regretted not sticking with my sister. It would have spared me from being forced to listen to what was undeniably a serial killer masquerading as a butcher. Our conversation continued, growing ever more disturbing by the moment. He described, in horrid detail, the slithering sound of guts being pulled and the weight of cow intestines in his hands. He said "cow", but we both knew he meant his countless human victims. He gesticulated how he cut them open and carved their meat, inhaling deeply as he smelled their fresh organs. He was so into it, that I could even see his pupils dilate and sweat form on his brow. I needed him to stop: I didn't want to hear this killer's confessions.  Taking a step back, I hesitantly mumbled, "Ri-right, I uh. I ought to get going."  As I was about to walk away, he gripped my shoulder tightly. With barely any effort, he twisted me around so he could look me in the eyes. His breath wreaked of week-old sausages and beer.  His bushy eyebrows twisted downwards as he gazed at me with his fierce green eyes, "Here," he said, slipping something into my jacket pocket.  *Oh god*, I thought. What had he given me? A human bone? An eye? A photo of his next victim? I was too scared to check. Too afraid that he would drag me out to his meat locker and gut me like he'd done with his other "cows". I forced a nervous smile, bowed my head respectfully, and mumbled a meek 'thank you' as I headed towards the other end of the room.  It was then that I noticed the firefighter and his crowd of eager followers were gone. I kicked myself for not checking on my sister sooner, but I figured she'd dispersed with the other kids and was stalking another guest. Hopefully she hadn't found her way to the butcher. I did *not* want to deal with the tantrum she'd have if she found out what happened to Bo Beep's sheep. Thankfully, she wasn't anywhere near him. After a quick scan of the area failed to produce her, I got a little worried.   I walked to the main desk and approached the librarian in charge, giving her a half-hearted wave, "You seen a kid wearing a *Frozen* dress walk by here, by any chance?" I asked her.  She shook her head, but smiled calmly, "I bet she's in the play area. Follow me," she answered.  She brought me to an open space full of toys, puzzles, and excited kids. I couldnt see my sister among the group. Hoping one of them had seen her, I knelt down and tried to get their attention.  "Have any of you seen Princess Anna walking around?" I asked.  A boy playing with building blocks smiled and pointed towards the back door, "She got to ride with the firefighter!" he answered.  I let out a sigh of relief. *Of course* she'd go see the fire engine. What kid wouldn't? My relief was short lived, dissipating when I noticed the librarian turning as white as a ghost.  "What firefighter?" she asked, her tone stressed.  "The one you guys invited to The Human Library," I answered.  I'm not even sure if I heard her reply, or if the look on her face conveyed the message for me. One way or another, I received the message loud and clear: there hadn't been a firefighter there that day.  Stomach twisting in knots, I bolted towards the door as quickly as my feet could take me, screaming my sister's name at the top of my lungs. I could hear the librarian and nearby parents gasping. Everything became a blur as I ran into the street, eyes darting back and forth for any clue as to her whereabouts. One of her shoes was lying outside an alley. In an instant, I turned into an adrenaline-fueled Superman, flying towards that alley and ripping through any obstacle in my way.  "LEGGO!!!" I heard my sister scream.  I could see her in the distance, my vision tunneling around her. She was feisty for a little kid, putting up an impressive fight against whoever was dragging her towards the opposite end. My chest was burning with pain, but I ignored it. I had to save my sister.  "YOU LET HER GO YOU BASTARD!" I shouted.  The next few moments were disjointed and out of focus, as though I was watching a low-quality movie spliced together at random. I heard tires shrieking, I saw my sister fall to the ground, and I noticed the general shape of a car speeding down the road. My momentum brought me staggering past my sister and into the street. I spun on my heels, picked her up, and checked her over while she sobbed loudly. Id never felt so relieved in my life.  "Heeeeey kiddo, it's okay. It's okay. I've got ya." I whispered, petting her head.  She was trying to say something, but I couldn't understand a word of it through her cries. She seemed awfully upset, but I couldn't blame her for it. She'd been through a lot.  We headed back towards the library. As I walked, I felt something poking into my side. I realized it was the thing the butcher had given me earlier. I reached into my pocket and pulled it out, emitting an inappropriate laugh. It was a 15% off coupon for a butcher shop in town. I laughed so hard that tears fell from my eyes. After regaining my composure, I pocketed the card, and walked into the library.  A frantic-looking woman shuffled over, her mascara running down her cheeks, W-wheres Cynthia? she asked, in panic.  My heart, which had been beating rapidly seconds before, came to a complete halt. I was so focused on getting my sister back, that I never even considered she wasn't the only child taken. An influx of guilt at the realization made my knees buckle, and I had to prop myself against the wall to stay upright. My sister continued to cry, her earlier pleas finally sinking in. She had tried to tell me, but I foolishly failed to understand.  I stood there, the reality dawning on me and freezing me in place. The woman begged me to give her any detail --- a license plate number, the make and model of the car --- anything. I hadnt even thought to check. The worst is that, as I racked my brain trying to remember, a passing image came to my mind. I had seen her. Just for a second, I had seen the other child biting the attacker, causing him to drop my sister. Id been so caught up with helping my sis that I failed to realize it at the time. And now, I think Cynthias going to be part of a whole different kind of *Human Library*.   Oh ho hooooo, you fooled me good! Guess I should stop putting the cart before the horse and read before I judge!   I would highly recommend [Bye Bye Moving](http://byebyemovingottawa.com). They offer good rates and do a great job. I've used them twice now and have always been more than satisfied.  They're also really impressive to watch. I have this heavy living room table with a ceramic top. Takes at LEAST two people to lift it. A single one of these guys can move it around no problem. It's insane.   My interest is definitely piqued.   Note to self: include 'pique' in every single story moving forward.   The lime-flavored ones are the best. Mmmmmmm.   It annoys the heck out of me when *I* get it wrong, which is more often than I care to admit. Piqued isn't a problem, but *peeked* and *peaked* are just so visually similar that I don't catch those errors when revise my text. I'd love to blame my autocorrect on being a jerk, but I'm pretty sure it's just my lack of attention to detail.  You're missing one, though:  Peacocked - meaning to have a peacock flung into one's face.  *The man peeked over the peak of the mountain, his interest having be piqued by the sound of a hundred thousand limbless torsos rolling along the valley on the other side. Alas, as he peered over the edge, he was peacocked.*  *Edited for italics.   Do not approach the dog park.  There are no dogs allowed in the dog park.  People are not allowed in the dog park.

That was absolutely ADORABLE.   **I must acquire them all.**   Leave a glass of OJ on the windowsill and you've got yourself a deal.   M-my cold and loveless hearti-it's melting...   It depends on *where* your condo is located and what amenities are included (pools, garages, etc.  = $$$).  I pay under 150$ a month on condo fees. 500-900$ a month seems insane to me, but it's all about location, location, location.  Think of it this way: a condo is like a house, except you don't have to take care of the lawn or shovelling. Plus, when repairs are needed, you're not the *only* person paying for it. A house is as much of a money-losing asset as a condo isbut maintaining it will likely cost you more in the long run.  I.e. A condo's roof might be bigger than a house's roof, but it's not THAT MUCH bigger. I'm going to throw a completely random number out there just to make a point, so don't quote me on this, but let's pretend a regular roof is, I don't know 2 000 square feet (again, random, unfounded number). Well, a condo's roof is maybe 5 000 square feet. Sure, it's bigger than a house's roof, but you're splitting the cost of repairing it between 12 households instead, which ends up costing you less.   There's nothing wrong about hiding in the bushes outside his house, OKAY?! Stop trying to make me feel bad about it!   Very true! WE'RE A HOOT. Get it? Because we're actually OWLS. HAhahahoooo hooooo hoooo.  (T_T That made no sense.)   Awesome, thanks! :D I wasn't even CLOSE to finding it. Wowsah, it DID get a lot of upvotes. Just goes to show that we don't always need to be funny! Yay for the NoSleep humorless clique! :D   ...I'm frantically searching through my post history to find it. Hahaha. Curious Manen is curious indeed.   Another excellent narration, Yara! :)   In case you *don't* have a Costco membership, Canadian Tire also sells propane for a fairly OK price.   Ah, man. That absolutely sucks. I hope you can recover your money somehow. :(   I'm sorry you went through hard times, but I'm glad you're doing better now.   I like concrete. It's cool. When you zoom in, you see a bunch of little pebbles.   Awesome! I love it! :D   Shhh  surrender yourself to the stories. The stories are living, breathing, writhing things that want to be told. We don't write them because we *want* to, we write them because they force us to.   Oh, thank goodness. That's much less frighteni-WAIT.   What is that monstrous face on the top-right of the dashboard? (Over the 6 circles.)   Please don't punch me again. :(   If you start a story that way, I will read it all the way through, I promise.   I don't have a best comment. Manen is a sad, humorless person. :(   I try not to let little details bother me, but I agree that people can get stuck in clichd versions of behaviors/jobs/locations. Unless it's pivotal to the story, I'll just ignore it. People get shrinks wrong all the time, but usually the story revolves around their client and the spooky stuff that happens to them, y'know? Maybe they're describing the most grossly inaccurate psychiatrist ever, but if the rest of the story holds up, I'll turn a blind eye. If you're writing a story about how you were a firefighter and something weird happened in an inferno but you haven't done even the slightest bit of research and describe the equipment and procedures completely wrong, then, yeah, that's another issue altogether.   Y'know what they say: when in doubt, set the story 50 years in the past, where no one can check for inaccuracies.   My biggest pet peeve is when someone starts the story by pointing out that they're not a writer. Honestly, if I see that, I exit out of the story immediately.   Fun fact: there's a historical statue near my workplace of some  dude who  uh, sailed or something. In his hand is an astrolabe. Turns out that the statue is holding it upside-down. Few people know or notice, and those who do don't really care, because the point is "Let's celebrate this famous historical figure".   I hope to feature a reading of this story on my YouTube channel :D  Ooooh, that'd be awesome. :)   Gracias. :)   All right, thank you. :) I do have a permanent position where I am at the moment, so I won't pursue the matter.  That said, perhaps one day I will have the pleasure to work with you.   ... Hmm ... Perhaps that would be do-able. *Perhaps*  In all seriousness. Is this a contract position? My curiosity is piqued.   Coding accessible HTML 5 websites is my home slice. I can do it in my sleep.   Hahahahahaha! Maybe that's what it was.   Thanks for catching the mistake (and for your kind words). Fixed it!   Hahahahaha!   The flag flew at half-mast, clinging to a rusted pole atop a crumbling building coated in roots and vines.  When the invaders came, we were given a choice: fight, or surrender. We proudly chose to fight with all our might.  First came the drones, raining death from the above. Even on the sunniest of days, the clear blue sky instilled fear in the hearts of all who dared to leave their shelter.  Next were the soldiers. Their rallying cries echoed in the distance. The front line drew closer and closer to our homes, until they waged wars and held siege right outside our doors. Still, we did not surrender.  Then came the biological weapons. Yellow haze blinded brave men and women fighting for their nation. Clouds of emerald melted their skin and infected their minds. They lived on, in agony, until the morning of the red fog. Their blood boiled and evaporated, covering the landscape in a crimson steam.  The worst was the sabotage. We decided that, if we couldn't have our land, no one would. We poisoned the crops, killed the animals, and polluted the waters until there was nothing left, not even for our own survival. Our children were the first to die. Unaware of the danger, some ate tainted food supplies, others died of starvation, and some simply melted into our rivers of acid. The bodies we could find were buried in unmarked graves or thrown in overflowing ditches along unpaved roads.  Finally came the mushroom clouds, the last nail in humanity's coffin. They rendered the world inhospitable for the few remaining survivors. Before long, all that was left was a wasteland of bones and morphed shadows clinging to broken walls.  Turned white by acid rain, bleached by the sun, and worn by time, the flag continued to sway gently in the breeze. In the end, it was not a nation or its people that surrendered: it was humanity itself. And so, the white flag flew at half-mast for a species too proud to survive.   I have definitely heard and seen some really weird stuff, but I don't actually believe in spirits, so I always attributed it to magnetic fields. They can really mess with your sense of perception.  That said, the strangest one I encountered was when I was in high school. I had braces back then, so I got in the habit of brushing my teeth straight after supper. I was in the bathroom upstairs when I saw the reflection of a figure standing in the doorway. This is the kind of thing when, in movies, the person turns around and the figure is gone, right? Well, I turned, but it was STILL there. I'm not saying it was headless, but I didn't *notice* a head. Just a long flowing white dress and light purple detailing. She turned around and walked into my sister's room. I followed her, thinking my sister was messing with me, but the room was empty.  I walked downstairs, saying "Hahaha, real funny, guys." because I was convinced they were pranking me. But then, I saw my mom, dad, and sister all sitting on the couch watching TV. They looked at me like they had no idea what I was talking about.   My first one lasted a couple years, I think? The second went on for barely a year. The last lasted a few months, then I gave up on webcomics for good.   Weeeebcooomiiiiiiiics!  Fun fact: I used to draw webcomics back in my youth. Ah, those were the days.   Fear is pretty subjective. What works for one person might not work for someone else. People who have kids, for example, might relate to the stories where children die from an unknown illness, and might be more inclined to be frightened by those tales.  But, hey, that's the beauty of NoSleep: you find pretty much everything here. From psychological horror to guts and gore, and everything in between. (Except psycho-murdering unicorns. I am very disappointed that no one has written a story about them.)   Thank you. ;D   I'm at work right now, so here's what [my office looks like](http://36.media.tumblr.com/41b6aa87fba94c99a26de41cc02f1a1b/tumblr_npmzmkHC3D1uqw4jao1_1280.jpg).   1. Your real story might just not have gotten any traction. It doesn't mean it was good or bad. Sometimes, good stories get swept under the rug, where they join a bunch of corpses that have been rotting there for years. 2. It's actually against the rules to comment on a story saying you should tl;dr it. This is a writing sub. If they're not willing to read, then they're the problem, not you. You go ahead and keep it as long as you want. If it's a good story, "they" will come. ("They" being either the undead, or readers.) 3. Don't turn it into a throwaway if you don't want to. Just tag your posts accordingly. There's nothing wrong with your username producing completely different styles of stories, touching on different subject matters.   You just made my monday morning. xD   Maybe he meant "stu**d**"?  This is definitely not the right place, as NoSleep is full of studs and stud-ettes. ;D   he'd wake up sick or in cold sweats randomly, or he would get extremely paranoid on some days, hearing people pound on his door etc.  Sounds like you're describing Monday mornings.   Don't worry, I'm here for you!  Except if you want me to rewatch Tokyo Magnitude 8.0. NEVER AGAIN. NEVEEER.   [Shin Sekai Yori](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Be0HqIhC48c)'s theme is also downright haunting. (WE ARE SUCH NERDS, badfakesmiles!!! SUCH NERDS.)   Nice to talk to you as well! Come hang out in the chatroom one of these days!   Hahaha no worries. The only way I can keep all the authors straight is by using a super-detailed spreadsheet of every single story they wrote. (I may or may not be joking.)   Thank you for your kind words!  I definitely did not write the lost town story, though. Not big on writing series---too afraid they'll get hated into oblivion. Manen's a very self-concious fellow.   I usually start at the newest story and just read in order, reading back until I have to do something else or until I'm done.  You are my hero. Good on you for not starting with the popular stories. I wish more people would do this.  I almost always either vote up or down.  Oooouh, slight hero-points removed for this, though. I get what your reasoning is, but I personally feel that downvotes should be used extremely sparingly. I see it this way:  * Upvote: I enjoyed this. * No vote: I disliked it. * Downvote: I HAVE BEEN OFFENDED GREATLY BY THIS AND WANT TO SEE THE AUTHOR AND ALL OF HIS WORK FAIIIIIL!  As a result, I avoid downvoting. I prefer letting the story die naturally. If it's bad, then it probably won't get many upvotes any way. If it just isn't my taste, then at least I'm not hindering the writer and preventing others from reading the story. (A single downvote can be the difference between staying on Nosleep's main page, and disappearing into oblivion.) If the story breaks the rules, then I report it. That's how I see it.   3   I never considered it, no, but it's an entertaining thought. It'd probably make for an interesting story. Mind you, a lot of the "advice"  is so incredibly ridiculous that you wouldn't -think- someone would follow it. I.e. "BURN THE HOUSE DOWN!" Obviously, no one's going to be gullible enough to do that, but someone might be inclined to follow some slightly less exaggerated advice. Hmmm...   I think it's all about momentum. If you're lucky and have a few upvotes early on, then your story will do well. If not, then it'll be buried underneath a mountain of other stories (and might get criticized).  Keep in mind that the majority of voters *aren't* fellow writers. They are super-sexy regular people who just want to read something scary. If your story manages to make them hide in the closet, then grammar and spelling mistakes probably won't matter that much.   Please forgive me, Rodriguez! I promise to use fabric softener on you tonight, even though I'm allergic!   It's not the mods' job to go through the stories and tag them. It's up to the authors to tag their stories.  There are a variety of reasons why a story might go unfinished. I understand that it's frustrating, and I'm sorry it bothers you. I'm not saying you don't have a valid complaint: just that you're directing it at the wrong people. It would be impossible for the mods to keep track of **all** the stories and tag them.  You might want to check out [The Nosleep Index Series Compilation](http://www.reddit.com/r/NosleepIndex/wiki/index) if you want to read series, but want to make sure they're complete.  Edit: I made a horrendous spelling mistake that SHAMED me. Shamed me, I tell you. It needed to be fixed, lest I shame not only myself, but my ancestors!   I'd say that kind of falls under "breaking immersion", which is a big no-no. That said, in your post, you *are* allowed to include **subtle** links to your website(s).  Most people who do this either hyperlink a random word in their story, or put an "X" at the bottom  and hyperlink it.  What you definitely DON'T want to do is this: "YO FOLLOW ME ON TWITTER"       Why waste time on old stories when you've got a slew of new skills and experiences at your disposal and you could just create something new?  For the same reason we renovate homes instead of building new ones: it creates jobs which, in turn, helps the economy grow. DO YOU HATE THE ECONOMY, KNEEOD?!  No, no wait. That definitely doesn't make sense. Let me try again.  Because  it keeps away the termites? Yeah. That's the reason. Termites. Let's keep them away.  (I can see the benefit of wanting to rework a story. Sometimes, you love the idea, but hate how it was applied, and want another kick at the can. I'd be inclined to go back and fix some of my stories if/when I release an anthology. 'Cause the formatting on some of my earlier ones makes my eyes bleed. And some of them weren't up to par. And termites. TERMITES EVERYWHERE.)   That's a pretty good question. Judging by your post title, I was going to send you to /r/NoSleepReruns/, but this is a little different.    wise mods, what think ye?   Don't we all? ;)   I definitely think something is going on, I'll give you an update on my findings tomorrow!!!    IF I SURVIVE.  : P   There's a **No Series** filter at the top of the page.   goodness, WHAT HAVE I UNLEASHED INTO THE WORLD?! My creation --- it's a monster. A *monster*, I tell you!   No, it did *good*. It climbed trees to rescue kittens, helped old ladies cross the street, and even helped fund a new roof for the community centre.    Ok! Noogie time! :)   Thank you so much. :3   Once you're *dead* and *spread* into ashes, people will finally see your true value, just like the great painters of the past! :D   [I was a decoy in a police line-up](http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/3625oc/i_was_a_decoy_in_a_police_lineup_but_it_all_went/)   I'll grind up grindhorse and make glue out of him for you! You probably just posted your story(ies) at a bad time.   This. Absolutely. Yes.   I  uhm  I feel *really* uncomfortable saying this, because I like to think I'm reasonably modest, but one could say that I'm a somewhat successful writer on NoSleep. I once posted a story on a throwaway just to see if it'd be popular even if it wasn't attached to this somewhat successful screename. I guess for my ego? I don't know.   I can't speak for the other authors, but that's why I did it. Just to prove to myself that people didn't *just* like my stuff because I had a few successful stories.   As it turns out, the throwaway story did good, so at least I didn't wind up CRUSHING MY OWN EGO TO LITTLE BITS AND PIECES LIKE A HUMPTY DUMPTY OF FAILURE.  	77
 This is the next episode in my Titan Quest LP. Feel free to leave feedback if you'd like. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KftIXmnSapA   https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8NWYU7OJs7K7HBb6QDoUtQ Been around for a few months but still small. Great to see all of us underdogs coming together to support one another.   This is the first episode in my newest let's play. Enjoy :) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3OJmTB03SX4   	3
 Based on your ratings, we have a pretty similar taste in euro games. The most suitable one is probably **Argent: the Consortium** where you use minis as workers for worker placement. It's decent with 2 players but probably best at 3-4.  Otherwise, minis usually mean thematic RPG (**Arcadia Quest**), Co-ops (**Mice and Mystics**) or map based area control games which only excels at high player count (**Kemet**, **Cyclades**).   A lot of people don't update their ratings to games, so BGG top 100 will never represent "the best 100 games out there" but rather "the Hall of Fame of 100 games". That's the reason why some successors and the original games are both in the top 100 (e.g. **War of the Ring**, **Imperial 2030** etc)      It's a neat little game that is fun to bring out every once in a while - best when you have actually forgotten about everything you did in your previous game. That's because it's completely deterministic. There is no random setup. The same buildings always comes out at a fixed time. Therefore I do not recommend replaying it frequently.   I do not recommend Bohnanza for 5p. Trading becomes too easy, and the game lasts too long for what it is.   I think so. When introducing a new game to a group, some basic labeling would help you find the right crowd. For example, "an area control game about engine-building and resource management (~Euro)" receives attention from a different crowd than "an area control game about betrayal and hidden identity (~Amerithrash)".  It's not about whether one is better than which. It's just a quick and simple way to identify with the right crowd.   Long-term goals: Grow to 4-5 dwarves, fill up most of your board, find 2-3 ways to accumulate a lot of points. Unlike Agricola, Caverna rewards specialising, not diversfying.  Mid-term goals: Food engine and dwellings. It might be sowing/ breeding/adventures/ eating resources. Whatever your strategy is, it's optimal to build corresponding rooms.   Tactical choices: Rubies are extremely powerful. Uses include - getting a pair of animals before breeding, digging a tunnel to build a mine, getting veg and grain before sowing, going out of turn for a big adventure etc. It's good to keep 1-2 rubies in front of you to keep your opponents nervous.   Solo: **Mage Night**  2-p: **Castles of Burgundy**  3-p: **Le Havre**  4-p: **Terra Mystica**  5-p: **El Grande**  6-p: **Pictomania**  7+: None. I'd rather split the group into 2 games.   It sounds like a co-op game would fit all 3 criteria.  **Shadowrun: Crossfire** games are relatively short and you can set your own difficulty. It also incorporates permanent upgrades to your characters as you play the game repeatedly.  **Robinson Crusoe** is a co-op survival game that scales from 1 to 4 players.   If that's the only criteria, [this](https://boardgamegeek.com/search/boardgame?sort=bggrating advsearch=1 q= include%5Bdesignerid%5D= include%5Bpublisherid%5D= geekitemname= range%5Byearpublished%5D%5Bmin%5D= range%5Byearpublished%5D%5Bmax%5D= range%5Bminage%5D%5Bmax%5D= range%5Bnumvoters%5D%5Bmin%5D=100 range%5Bnumweights%5D%5Bmin%5D= range%5Bminplayers%5D%5Bmax%5D= range%5Bmaxplayers%5D%5Bmin%5D= range%5Bleastplaytime%5D%5Bmin%5D= range%5Bplaytime%5D%5Bmax%5D= floatrange%5Bavgrating%5D%5Bmin%5D=7 floatrange%5Bavgrating%5D%5Bmax%5D=10 floatrange%5Bavgweight%5D%5Bmin%5D=4 floatrange%5Bavgweight%5D%5Bmax%5D=5 colfiltertype= searchuser=test_subject2751 nosubtypes%5B0%5D=boardgameexpansion playerrangetype=normal B1=Submit) is probably what you're after.  But **Mage Knight**, **Kanban**/**Vinhos**, **18xx**, **Here I Stand**, **Twilight Imperium** are all heavy games that are on par with Through the Ages but they are vastly different games. It would therefore be more helpful if you provide more information:  What did you like/dislike about Through the Ages? What's your usual player count?   Games new to me:  **The Doge Ship** - An average worker placement game. I'm usually up for dry euros, but I feel like there's mostly tactical play in this game and not enough strategy.   **Formula D** - We played the base game only. A lot of probabilities and calculations involved, but I'd say it's a good game if you don't take the dice rolls too seriously.  Games that I've played before:  **Kanban** - taught it to 3 newbies but they all got on quickly. It's always a blast making jokes about office culture and meetings during the game.  **Panamax** - Probably my second favourite in 2014 after Kanban. Taking the offshore account card secured my win.  **Castles of Mad King Ludwig** - Probably my third favourite in 2014 still. The score updating is still a bit fiddly and the presence of AP players are what my ratings down.  **Agricola** x2 - Made a huge mistake that I probably will not forget whenever I play Agricola in the future....after having the baking tray I used the Major Improvement space to build the clay oven as I forgot that it could be built as a Minor Improvement. Lesson learnt at a severe cost.  **Splendor** - I still enjoy the game as a filler but probably will not voluntarily suggest bringing it out any more.   Have you tried the **Terra Mystica Fire and Ice Expansion** yet? It changes the base game quite a lot.  I'm pretty sure you would enjoy **Panamax**, **Kanban**, **Vinhos**, and **Brass**.   I recommend trying at [London On Board](http://www.meetup.com/LondonOnBoard/events/). There's a meetup practically every day and it's quite easy to find people to join Eclipse. I have seen it played every other week.   Borrowing examples from well known games:  Ownership of buildings that other players may use at a cost (**Le Havre**, **Lords of Waterdeep**, **Keyflower**)  Anything with area control (**Belfort**, **Dominant Species**)  Sharing stakes in the same company (**Imperial 2030**, **Panamax**, **Chicago Express**)   Yup. It's not about drawing well, it's about highlighting key concepts and getting it done quickly so you can start guessing other people's drawings.   **Pictomania** is a ton of fun, I highly recommend it. In a N player game, each round there will be a 7 x N matrix of items/events/ideas and players are assigned a specific column and row to draw (e.g., Column X, Row 3). Therefore, you are already certain that no-one else is drawing anything from Row 3. Drawing and guessing happens simultaneously, and you receive points if other players guess your drawing correctly and vice versa, with a speed bonus.  Players are rewarded for **creativity** - expressing themselves concisely, **deduction** - sort of sudoku like when you're not entirely sure what other players are drawing, and **boldness** - making quick guesses on other players' drawings.   A minor con to the game is that it tests players' knowledge on actual historical figures (e.g. King Arthur), objects (e.g. U boat vs shipping boat) and pop culture (how do you draw the 7 books of Harry Potter differently?). Obviously if players get uncomfortable these cards could be removed by player consensus when they are drawn.   All pretty safe bets for ~4p games: **Lords of Waterdeep**, **Dead of Winter**, **Sheriff of Nottingham**, **Hanabi**, **Castles of Mad King Ludwig**, **Dominion**  	17

 No Ragrets   Best game ever   Good lord man   You sure that isn't a weed issue?   When I realized some of the high school kids I coach were born in the year 2000. Mind blowing!   Human Centipede   I have never gotten any cool PM's. I figured if I stayed active on Reddit long enough and made enough funny comments maybe someone would show me their boobs or something. I was sadly mistaken.   Anything by Matoma or Kygo   Is it worth more than that?    Truer words have never been spoken   Damn, Afroman needs to puff one down and not deck chicks. Holy shit that was unnecessary.    Keep fighting the good fight brotha!   Doucheeeee! Douchheeeee! Douchenozzle!!!!   John Glenn, what a badass!   Why are there children sitting there watching that?   Does it grow packs of Jujubee's? Those are absolutely delicious!   I listed a house for sale. $2.1 million!   Police cop?   A beer bong   Fuck Tim Kawakami and everything he stands for.   Came here to post about Pennywise, glad it was already covered.   Majestic   Love it   That's awesome!   She was flying!   What it comes down to is that I'm borderline sexist and don't really find women ensemble casts that funny. If you enjoy those comedies though, who am I to judge. Carry on.   I'm well aware I can trade stocks on my own. My financial advisor is one of my best friends. He's very smart, knows the stock market more intimately than me and has invested my money quite successfully for me. I pick some stocks myself, but he also comes to me with ideas when I have some money to invest. It's a nice personal and professional relationship.   I'm quite happy to learn I don't know who was in Bridesmaids or who will be in this lame all-female reboot of a classic franchise. I'm not even defending Marvel movies per say, I'm just saying that this sounds like the worst movie idea I've ever heard.   You want to see a Ghostbusters movie with the same cast as Bridesmaids. I didn't really think I had to explain why I felt sorry for you, but there you go.   I feel really sad for you   You'd rather see an all-female Ghostbusters that will surely tarnish the good name of a proud movie franchise than something like Avengers: Age of Ultron?   I am rooting for Bane to blow up the whole stadium. Hooray Team Bane!   Thank god I didn't bail on my Apple stock a few months back when it wasn't looking so hot.  Edit: I just checked and apparently Apple went down over 3 points today. Apparently beating all the forecasts and making $18 billion dollars in one quarter isn't enough for Wall Street. I know nothing about the stock market haha.  Edit 2: Texted my financial advisor and fellow redditors reporting, up 6% after close. Profit reported after the close of the market. Feeling good again!   This gives me a freedom boner   Who cares...   Have you no decency sir?   Ask him why he sucks so much ass...

I just got back from the snow with my Berner. I hated taking him away from it. He is so at peace in the mountains!   That hit me right in the feels   Love him!   Everything about this!!!  	50
 We both love cream of whatever soups, Gumbo, and things like Beouf Bourgignon, that require a coating of flour before searing the meat. Of course there are many soups that don't require flour, but I'd like to adapt our favorites to fit her needs. She was only recently diagnosed.   I have a dutch oven I got for my birthday a couple months ago that I still haven't broken in, but I'll ask her if she has utensils that haven't been tainted.   Sadly, there are no Trader Joe's here in Southern Indiana, but other replacements seem workable.   I am planning on making a bunch of soup for a friend with Celiac's. However, all of our favorites involve flour.  I know the obvious substitutions for thickening agents (cornstarch + water, instant mashed potatoes), but what about recipes where you need to cover chunks of meat with flour before searing (beouf bourgignon and the like)? Would rice or almond flour work for things like this?  She is completely broke (not like that "broke as a joke" post, she literally has $5 for the rest of the month), so I want to help her out as much as I can. I was planning on making several types of soup in the next few days anyway, but I never cook gluten free, since I don't have a problem with it.  What suggestions do you wonderful cooks have?  EDIT: thank you all for the suggestions! I will be making quite a few soups with your help this week.   Thanks, now I need to watch a bunch of Eyewitness mpvies to further my finals procrastination.   Keep supporting her. Since you said you also SH, that makes it a little easier. Suggest that she go to see a professional, but don't push it too much (I just went through something where my friends pushed too hard). Let her know that it hurts you when she hurts herself, and, if she doesn't already know, let her know that you suffer from the same thing.  Furthermore, do not EVER feel that you can help her pain by harming yourself. I know it can hurt, seeing someone you love harm themselves, but the only person who can help them is them. Do what you can, but always remember that.   I've met many cats who take worse pictures than Marshall Erikson.   Yeah, I always just get the "come over to feed them every day and they'll take care of themselves." Although I did leave both of mine with family when I was gone for a week this summer, but they are both basically dogs, so being alone for a wrek probably would have been bad for them.   I even love 21st Century Breakdown. Maybe because it came out when I was 17, maybe because Green Day has had a special place in my heart for as long as I can remember.  The rock opera thing was pretty bad, but if you treat it like any other album, I personally think it's pretty solid.   I had no idea that was why!   I always laughed when my ex farted near me, even if it smelled. He laughed less, but that's part of why he's an ex.   Great Pyrenees are also often crazy. A family friend fostered some for several years and they were all nuts. First one killed himself five minutes after they left by running around and wrapping the chain around his neck (15 minutes before the dogsitter arrived), the second was the only dog to ever bite me, the third and fourth had to be fostered by someone else because they tried to kill each other and the family cats.   My religious friends always said that it may be different for everyone. Like, for me it would be eternal winter, for some it would be eternity in a tiny room. Whatever would be the worst for you.   Not the same sex, but I introduced my second cat to a girl who was around the same age (11 months). They were snuggling after about a month.   I love the little freckled toes!   It isn't too hard to get rid of fleas. My apartment was infested when I moved in, so I just spent the night with a friend after deploying the flea bomb and gave my baby a bath with dish soap.   http://www.imgur.com/LtbVIyW.jpeg I'm down!   Yup, both my domestic short hairs have it (salt and pepper tabby with a white tummy and ginger tabby), although it is more pronounced in the little baby salt and pepper girl.   It may not be food poisoning, but every time I've gone there in my 22 years living in Btown, I spend two days on the toilet spewing from both ends. Maybe we have some weird allergy, but it's still good to make sure.   Make sure the kids can handle it, though. I love Mother Bear's, but both my sister and I get violent food poisoning every time we go. I still indulge about once a year, but my sister and I aren't the only people I've heard this from.   I'm lazy enough that I don't go online. Try TIS first, then the bookstore. Don't expect anything back from novels (3 years as a French major taught me that), nor from custom books. It's pretty hit or miss, but I always get at least $20 back each semester.   I make croissants every couple months, and this is the best trick I've learned.   It's soo good. I think the place is called The Blue Moon, but I've never actually been. I've got family from right around there, so they bring some up every time they visit.   This! I also like to use a fifth of some liquor in a cylindrical bottle as a rolling pin. While the dough is chilling, put the bottle in the freezer. That way the pin won't warm up the dough too much.   I have no idea how they season or prepare it, but a tiny little hole in the wall in Owensboro, Kentucky has some of the best brisket I've ever had. Their mutton and pulled pork are better, but they're amazing.   Bloomington/Ellettsville chiming in, we call them potlucks.   Oh no, this reminded me that I have one to finish in the next three weeks!   The Guardian did a review, and it sounds as sub par as you'd expect.   Rabbit is amazing. A little gamey, but it tates like a mix of pork and lamb, from what I remember. I don't have any qualms eating it, because they're so prevalent. The phrase "fucking like rabbits" exists for a reason,   I've sadly only had it as sausage. Venison sausage is good, but doesn't have the same gamey flavor.  I have had rabbit, squirrel, and ostrich, though, which are all really good.   What I've always heard is "you have a domestic short, medium, or long hair, or you paid some serious bucks for it." Not always true, cuz I have a friend who got a pure bred Maine Coon from a shelter, and I've seen some Scottish Folds at my local shelter, but we haven't selectively bred cats like we have dogs.   I need to get a harness for my ginger boy, bwcause he loves being outside, even on a leash, but he bolts and his breakaway collar lets loose and I end up chasing him around the parking lot for 10 to 15 minutes, trying to keep him from running into the street. I'd love if they could be indoor/outdoor, but there's too many cars around my apartment for that.   It's sad that New Amsterdam tastes pretty good for my unrefined tastebuds. When I'm out and about, I won't order anything worse than Sapphire, but for a simple mixed drink while watching Star Trek, cheaper stuff is ok.   It's good for making vanilla extract..... That's about it.   Sounds awesome, besides the vodka (ugh again). The only way I can describe the tatse of vodka, even really good vodka, is "freshman year and regret."   I'm gonna finish the ham I made for Friendsgiving Sunday in the next day or so, so I think I'm gonna make some stock with that bone and the chicken carcass I have in my freezer, then make some split pea soup. I'm just hoping to finally break in the enameled cast iron Dutch oven I got for my birthday over a month ago.   Simple gin and cranberry for me. Since I'm still a poor colkege kid, it's New Amsterdam gin and Kroger brand cranberry juice, but it's better than nothing.   Always helps me. Maybe add a touch of honey, to help it stick to your throat. Whiskey+hot water+lemon juice+honey always helps my sore throats.   Buddha only had a male dog friend (Cody), but he only started squatting when he was 14 or so. Copying makes sense, though.  They both lasted for a long time, though. Cody was a cocker spaniel who wandered off one day a few months shy of his 18th birthday, and we put Buddha (a Newfie/Black Lab/German Shepherd mix) down when he was 15.   Glass blowing is awesome. I've seen a few demonstrations from the one at Indiana University Bloomington , and I know at one point all the scientific glassware at the University of Wisconsin at Madison was made by my grandfather. It's a skill I hope to gain at some point in my life.   And when my old boy dog was at the end of his days and arthritic enough, he squatted just like the bitches.   My first grade teacher told us that the reason Northern Indiana doesn't have as many hills as Southern Indiana because the iceberg that sunk the Titanic fell on the country and squished all the hills south.   Friendsgiving was amazing! I've still got some Dr. Pepper/sriracha ham left, but the curried butternut squash risotto and green beans with almonds didn't last 20 minutes. And per suggestion, I went with a spinach and arugula salad before everything else.  I didn't have time to bake my own bread or make dessert, but it was still appreciated.  EDIT: I did have to cut a few inches off the top of the ham because one of the cats started licking it while I wasn't looking. Assholes.   The more you know!  HuHot is good for what it is. Of course the badly translated stuff from the hole in the wall where they barely speak English is better.   This sounds a lot like the Hu Hot chain here in the states. Which is amazing, even though it's a chain. They have a bar where you fill a bowl with meat, veggies, and sauces, then they stir fry it all on a huge metal slab.  Nice to know the origins, because it was a huge deal when Hu Hot opened here in southern Indiana.   I always make a boatload of cookies (chocolate chip, sugar rolled in various colors of sugar, gingersnap, and these weirdly amazing salty oatmeal ones), fudge/truffles (mint chocolate and kahlua are the most popular), and fancy chocolate covered pretzel sticks (over the years there's been white and dark rolled in crushed candy canes, peanut butter and bittersweet, and so many others).   Here's why I only go on $3 Thursdays. Still $3 for a double at my usual, although it's $6 once my friends and I go to the club across the street.   So sweet. In other news, I have that same panini press/griddle.   And it ain't nowhere near big enough to be a malamute. Also, I'd think a dog indigenous to Guam wouldn't be that furry/kinda fluffy.   OH GOD, WHERE DO I GET THE SALTED LICORICE ONES?!?!? I guess my Scandinavian heritage is showing, because salted licorice is my second favorite type of candy (regular licorice being number one).   Never heard of it before, but I bet I do.   You've gotta wait a bit before consuming. Mix the pellets in with some of the melted stuff, and oh man. Makes me think back to when we had a kiosk in the mall at home.   I have sone undergrad friends who lived in Tulip Tree. Not sure if it was hard to get a spot, but it was an amazing 3 bedroom,   Where's the option for strawberry?!?  Edit: although I may just be weird, cuz pistachio is a close second for me....   Love them all, but so so happy about your comment on Alloy. Reminds me of a terrible pale pink lipstick I vought once that can only be described as "baby prostitute color."   Haha, I love being able to hug her so easily, even though she protests. And I'm enough of a spaz when it comes to the health of the kitties that I call the vet pretty much the second I catch one of them puking, because they hardly ever do it.   I don't ever have bananas :-(   I learned the hard way to only cook chicken the second it's defrosted. I'm usually a skeptic when it come to exact guidlines, but eating chicken that has been frozen, then in the fridge for three days, is a terrible, terrible idea.  Also, as always, smell it. If it smells even the tiniest bit off, ditch it. It's better than spending three days on the toilet, switching which end your illness comes out of.   I'm hosting Friendsgiving on Sunday, the day before classes start up again. Several of my friends weren't able to go home for Thanksgiving (although they are getting a good dinner from another friend), and I hope to send them home with some leftovers, since I can afford it. So, I'm planning on something untraditional, since I get sick of turkey in a few days. Does this menu sound good?  Dr. Pepper glazed ham (had it last year and everyone seemed to like it)  Curried butternut squash risotto (another favorite from last year, and a decent vegetarian entree)  Roasted mixed veggies (I'm thinking turnips, beets, parsnips, and carrots)  Green beans with almonds  Brioche to go with it all (making brioche is awesome)  And pain au chocolat for dessert (making croissants is even more awesome).   I really like sauteed green beans with almonds. Butter and oil if it needs to be vegetarian, just oil if it needs to be vegan.    Spicy glazed carrots are also good. I usually saute the carrots for a bit, then glaze with a brown sugar, sriracha, and water reduction.  These are both things I serve at my Friendsgiving, since I have a lot of vegetarian friends.   She'll be two in March, and only weighs 6 and a half pounds. The vet always comments on how petite she is.      I called those circular bales of hay "hay pigs," for a really long time. Kids are just silly.   I've only made then a couple times, but I'd agree that is too short. I put mine in the water before going to the store for wine, garlic, and bread, then rinsed them again. It was about 45 minutes. Super amazing, not sandy at all.   "Authentic full English breakfast poutine barbeque pizza paella"   Mine are technically Katrine and Guillaume (former French major). Kate because everyone I've ever met woth that name is super feisty (my dad only calls my mom that when she's being feisty, haha), and Bill because I hold the belief that all ginger cats should be named after Weasleys, haha.  I couldn't imagine fostering that many! Kate was a foster failure, I only got Bill because she needed a friend.   Haha, I posted a pic a while ago of my kitties lounging on my radiator. Now that it's turned full blast, they just do just what yours is doing,   Apparently I'm weird because I can't not give animals human names. I've got Kate and Bill. This little girl looks like a Sophie to me.   This, and water if you're shaping cookie dough into balls.   One of my best friennds hates peas for the same reason. I don't get it, but everyone has different tastes. I personally don't get how anyone can enjoy avocados, so you do you.   The dreaded three-day hangover struck me a couple weeks ago. Get yourself some oatmeal, that's my number one cure.   I think they migrate to those who are severely allergic first, though.   It's still a good idea to get a round of rabies shots after getting bitten, just in case.  My mom got bitten by one that got into the house earlier this year, and the doctor told her to go through with the shots. Sadly, even with insurance, it was $2400 for the whole thing, and it apparently hurt like hell (especially the one directly into the wound the day of, but getting several in a couple weeks would suck anyway).   Thank goodness I wasn't the only one who noticed.   Aww, I actually enjoy Enterprise. It is quite bad (the theme mskes the Firefly theme seem like a masterpiece, haha), but I still like it.   All of the Star Treks. The idea that there may one day be an Earth without poverty, without war, it's amazing. Voyager and Deep Space 9 are my favorites, but they are all wonderful.   I was one for two years in high school, and I always had the same early morning shift at the school. You get really attached to the people who come to your pool three times a week before work, and they get attached to you. They compliment you on your musical tastes, or tell you stories about "that time I saw Eric Clapton." They literally trust you with their lives, and they ask you about your swim meet that evening (a few of the guys who came in were either teachers or had children on the team). They ask how you're doing, and get excited when you tell them about your future.  It's been almost 4 years, but I still have a huge affection for "my old guys."   When I was little, the optometrist my family went to was named Dr. Ball, which was probably a terrible name. However, the clinic had a thing where they added the word "eye" before every doctor's name, so he was called Dr. Eyeball. It was pretty awesome when I was nine.   My eyesight isn't even that bad, but my optometrist is one of my favorite people.   "12 at night, love or fight/any way is right if you come out in night/its sp out of sight in Devil's Canyon."  Not quite as bad as I remembered, but no Leonard Cohen.   Free? My grandmother has been in this type of facility twice (2010 when she got her knee replaced and late last year when she broke her hip), and it was incredibly expensive. That facility works as both a nursing home and a rehabilitation center, and does get donations from the community, but staying there, even for a few weeks, can rack up a 5 figure bill.   IIRC, he wrote a song for them, but they rejected it. It's been a couple years since I re-read Helter Skelter, but my copy has a couple if his songs, and they're bad. Like, really really bad.   I sadly don't have any from that age, but here's a recent one! She's only 6 and a half pounds, and will be two in March. Tiny tiny.  http://www.imgur.com/null.null   Being in the good side of your landlord is a good idea. I call the property management company about everything, so I only have to pay pet rent for one of my two kitties. Means I can't foster another, since I asked them before trying, but being on the gopd side of your landlord is really good, since they could make you homeless, if they wanted to.   Kinda makes me happy my landlord won't allow more than two pets. The two kitties make it hard enough to get thing done.   A calico and a goat? This picture is my dream.   This is exactly why I got cats instead of a dog (although I didn't intend on getting any pets until my former roommate decided to foster a kitten who stole my heart). Even a large single apartment isn't good to the type of dog I'd like, and class means I couldn't take a big Rottie or Newfie or Irish Wolfhound (my favorite) on as many long walks as he'd need. Once I move into a house with a big enough yard, I will get myself a nice big dog.   My tiny runt would disagree. She was only a tiny bit bigger than this at 12 weeks, when I met her.   Those look even higher quality than the ones I have. But they're lifesavers.   Also remember to allow for the fact that it will take longer to walk anywhere and that parking lots are always treacherous. I had to make a run to the Kroger on 2nd this morning before class, and nearly faceplanted several times in the parking lot alone.  I will also suggest going on Amazon and buying what can only be described as tire chains for your feet. I will look them up later, but they're $25, and are perfect for those of us who have to walk everywhere on the ice. Saved me from several bad falls last winter.   "And don't know how old it is" = proper sourdough starter. Jealous.   AirFrance has some pretty legit food, or at least it did in 2010. I mean, it's legit for economy class airplane food, but the French take food seriously enough that even the airplane food was decent.   O'Hare is just so legit. Only flown out of and into it once, but it was so much better than the Indy airport (which is actually really nice). SFO also has some really legit food, although $6 for a caprese sandwich is a bit much.   One of the only bad things I've found about the Indianapolis International Airport is that this is so not true. There's McD, shitty "mexican," and shitty "asian." Although, I've only ever flown out of it in the morning, maybe there are better things open past 9am.   Especially if you make the puff pastry from scratch, which is one of my favorite time intensive things to do.   I just brew some insanely strong coffee and use that to replace the water in ny recipe.   Not Thai, but there's a cajun restaurant I go to fairly often, and I always order the "spicy thai" etouffee, and they say that they are legally obligated to tell you how spicy it is.   First off, it's great that you're cooking for your family, and that you enjoy cooking.  Don't get too down because they don't express their feelings on the intricacies of your cooking. Some people can't pick them up, and some people don't even realize what the different flavor combinations are that make something taste good. I cook for my friends fairly often, and, while they say it's good, they don't say "oh, the nutmeg is what makes this curry really good," or "this is perfectly spiced."   This is me with Rally's. Dat fry lover's burger, tho.   Stoned. Fuck yeah.   I had a thing for dog treats when I was little. And I know a couple people who would eat wet cat food. So not too weird.   Upvote for music suggestion, although I would say that you should never ever ever skip Touch. Took a couple weeks, but that song def turned into my favorite of the album.   Ohmygod, ohmygod, mom, this box is so much fun!   Qit. Edit:        My parents got an electric cast iron one as a wedding present, and it still works wonderfully 30 years later.   I'm def gonna be trying this, cuz I personally dislike chickpeas.   I also suggest stocking up on sauces and spices you know you like. When I cook for friends, it's often just pasta+veggies+whatever genre of sauces and spices I'm feeling. Curry powder+nutmeg+red pepper flakes, hoisin+garlic powder+red pepper flakes/sriracha, or carbonara (noodles+bacon+egg+cheese) are some of my favorites.   Selling ramen at the liquor store? The only better idea I've even seen is the grilled cheese food truck that parks outside the bars every night.   Seconding the celeriac. My family used to always have a stock of cream of celeriac soup on deck until my dad found out he was allergic to celery.  	109

       And you know that 100 years ago someone was crying "Think of the children! Nipples are sinful! Everyone will be lusting after them!"   This is what I posted on Facebook:  Tomorrow is the 15/15/15 Moneybomb for Bernie. Join this Thunderclap to maximize its impact.   One of his most impressive stats is that he's received 400,000 donations from 250,000 different people, averaging $33. To give that some perspective, Obama (who defeated Hillary last time) had 180,000 donors by this point in the 2008 cycle, and Hillary has gotten donations from 50,000 people, but has raised 3 times as much money. She has the 1%, Bernie has us, the 99%.    So join this Thunderclap and let's drive those numbers up even higher to show everyone that Bernie is the candidate FOR the people, BY the people!  Feel free to steal use any of it if you think it'll help.   Doesn't seem to be a problem for ATMs.                                                                                       Thank you.

Bernie believes in power to the people and the people controlling the government, and I believe in that also.   Look at his competition/peers. I'm not going to say that Ted Cruz, Mike Huckabee, Scott Walker, etc. are as ridiculous as Trump, but they certainly play at his level.

Make sure he's set up to vote in your state's primary:  http://voteforbernie.org/   What?   I'm sure he will. His campaign is only 2 months old, and he doesn't have billionaires and SuperPACs supporting him.     I was speaking about the country as a whole, not specifically in reference to Florida. I should have clarified, as both the article and the parent comment were about Florida.  My bad.            I think many Sanders supporters have come to see the light by seeing just how aligned with Bernie their personal beliefs are, and these tests are a great way to show them that. I posted a link to [ISideWith.com](http://www.isidewith.com) on my Facebook wall today, and I think my friends were surprised to find out just how pro-Bernie they are.  Personally, I like ISideWith.com's test. I think it offers some really great resources and offers a very thorough set of answers across the political spectrum. But there are many out there, so post the one that you think is the best to the social media of your choice.   It never amazes me how the republicans are credited as being the party of Christianity, but almost everything that they stand for goes against the things that Jesus taught. He was incredibly liberal, yet "the religious right" has somehow claimed him.      /r/gogopgo   I actually think that if he wins the nomination, democratic turnout would skyrocket, which would be huge. The republicans are going to show up and vote for their guy, they always do (that's why the country is so much more liberal than the government, the left is underrepresented among actual voters). But if we give the left someone to get excited about, like Bernie, then I think they'll actually turn up and elect him.                             	200

 That's different from what I mean. Calling out of work just because you don't feel like it. That kind of laziness is what I'm talking about here. Sitting in your car listening to music when you should be working, that's not being innovative. That's being lazy. Innovations are one thing, but if you're being lazy for the sake of being lazy, then that's what I'm talking about here.   I'm that guy that who tells stories "like an old man" as my wife points out all the time. I tell a story with every detail and it bothers her. Like a grandpa on tv when he's telling a war story but without falling asleep in the middle.   Quit being such a lazy asshole. Being lazy is the worst human trait ever. Work is good for you. I hate laziness. I want to call out every lazy person on their bull shit but if I did, then so many people I work with would dislike me to no end.   My dad always says the same thing. He grew up Catholic but didn't raise us the same.   The first time I saw marijuana up close. I smelled it and the smell was immediately familiar. Growing up, my family always visited my grandma who lived about 2 hours away. Her house always had a distinct smell and I wasn't sure what it was. When I smelled marijuana for the first time, it was as though I was back at grandma Tracy's house. Every time I'm ever close enough to marijuana, I can't help but take a big whiff.   Either of the following: 1. The smell of bleach on my hands no matter how hard I scrub 2. Stickiness 3. The sensation of wearing wet socks all the time 4. Standing in line for something I can't go on without 5. Driving in heavy traffic when I'm already late   This is perfect. I hate being sticky. Hate isn't strong enough of a word.   I see a lot of y'all want them to alter penis size and erection control. I would like to add my two cents to that idea. Twist the right one for penis length and the left one for girth. Push the right one in to activate penis erection and the left one to deactivate penis erection. Push them both in at the same time to immediately ejaculate. This last one would come in handy if you're experiencing that long fuck like Dave Chappelle's wrap it up box skit.   .   Pizza Hut? I'm sure it is because their D.O.T. probably looks like a joke. Those clowns couldn't deliver a pizza on time if the food learned to deliver itself.   Came here to say this. Just the other day I bought a hundred dollar bottle of 18 year old single malt Glenlivet. Good stuff.   I gave my co-worker this same advice just a little while ago.   That's not worse than my brother in law piling "wasabi" sauce on his food thinking it was guacamole.   My mother in law convinced her daughter (20 years ago) that cantaloupe was alligator eggs.   The store I work at, if you order thin crust, we cut it into squares. Also, the artisan pizzas are cut into squares. Unless you mean a regular pizza that's shaped like a square. Then no.   I know a guy like that. His name also happens to be Matt.   He looks like he just woke up from a night of drinking.   What's the ratio of the pink sauce   Wait until there's about an hour left to my day and declare war on the rest of the planet (including allies). Then just go back to being me.   I'd walk in like "What up? I got a big cock!" Sorry, had to be done... I'm a terrible person.   I'll eat Vienna sausages but I refuse to eat that mushy canned meat that my wife claims is "the exact same thing but it's smashed up". Fuck that! No! I refuse! It smells like rotten cat food. Nope nope nope.    Which is why anytime I want the cheap taste of a fast food burger, I get the number five from McDonald's (double quarter pounder with cheese). No mayo by default.   I'm not the only one then. Tuna salad = Hell yeah! Hot tuna in any form = I'll starve to death first.    Same here   I've used numerous furnishings as masturbation assistants. Such items included two pillows tapped together, a mattress with a hole cut in it, and between two couch cushions (which didn't feel so good because they were those corduroy feeling couch cushions like this -- http://imgur.com/f2Sah8P which as soon as I realized my mistake I never used that couch again. Also a micro-fleece blanket which I simply rubbed my junk on until I came.   I've done that... desperate times...   I might look like an idiot for this.   What's a "bae"?

Bobby was what my siblings and I called him. Robert is what my mom called him.   Any and all of the lyrics from "The Fox" - Ylvis It's like the Fisher Price toy that has the handle you pull and it tells you about different animal noises.   My parents needed me to stay with my uncle Robert and his boyfriend Lee at their apartment for a few days. The first night was fun, we all hung out in their room playing Nintendo 64, eating malted milk balls, and drinking soda. Then I had to go to bed. In a lonely dark room with a painting of some guy. This painting was weird to me and I couldn't sleep with it hanging right next to the bed. It was dark.  The door opened slightly letting some of the light in from the hall. Then a shadow blocked the light. It was dark. My uncle walked into the room. He asked why I was still awake. I said the painting bothered me. It was dark. He confessed the painting bothered him too.        Uncle Bobby sat beside me on the bed. He asked me if I would do something for him. It was dark.  I laid there quietly. He grabbed my hand and asked if I would keep a secret. I froze. It was dark.  He reached under the blanket. I felt his clammy hand get a light grip. As he gripped his target, he whispered "don't tell." He took the hand he held and moved it to himself and made me grip him as he whispered "up and down." It was dark.   I work for Dominos as a delivery expert and I'm addicted to two things. Delivering pizza and seeing the reactions on the customer's face when they realize how quick we got the food to them. "You guys are always so quick!" And/or "I was told 25 minutes and it's onlu been 18, wow!" It's so addictive. I love my job.   A Klondike bar   Frozen pancakes baked to a crisp (not burnt) served with vanilla ice cream. Just because I was high when I first made it, doesn't mean it's a bad idea.   Shoes, mattresses, socks, underwear, tp, electronics, Oreos and stuff for your personal transportation (tires, brakes, fluids, battery etc).    Mississippi brings the Elvis sandwiches and catfish. (Prepared separately).   hitting the nail on the head - you did it right   Being the family computer know-it-all has its advantages. If I knew I'd be in trouble or I knew there was something I wanted to do, I would blacklist the MAC addresses of my parents' computers and devices. I'd "troubleshoot" for a short while and WHAM! No trouble accomplishing my goal. They would take it easy on the fussing and/or grounding or I'd usually end up going to that party or whatever.   Santa used the exact same two or three different wrapping papers as my parents. This seemed a bit suspicious.    I hate that too. My wife does that to me all the time.   This sounds like my kind of drinking buddies. Can't get that around here.   That sucks   A shovel. I used to dig holes in the back yard and got deep enough to drop down. Sometimes, I'd dig in a different direction once I got in and it'd be like a mining adventure and I'd find little stuff that was buried. One time I found a gold watch and someone's time capsule. There were old baseball cards, an old knife (Vietnam war era), and a small bag of "marbles" which turned out to be diamonds all in the time capsule. My dad sold the diamonds for about $500. We moved away from there and I stopped digging.    "Hey asshole, get the fuck out of the road!"   Until I was about twelve, I had an embarrassing lack of knowledge on how the powerball worked. I used to think one could write the numbers on the ticket themself. So my grand idea was "hey dad, why not just leave your powerball ticket blank until they say the winning numbers. You'd win!" I felt really stupid when I learned the numbers are pre-printed on the ticket.    I never did reach level 100 unless you count all the levels I've lost through PKers and lured higher level monsters (back when it was possible). Along with those lost levels, add in the various characters I've gotten to level 40+. With all that mentioned, I've probably reached level 200. Otherwise, I've never joined the level 100 club. I also stopped playing when it became harder to sell bps of runes. I used to have a steady customer base of over 50 players in Amera back then. I could generate 50k a day from rune creation. Now, pfft.   My wife enjoys "OviPets" or some shit. You only pay if you choose. In not sure on the details but if you remember neopets, that's what it reminded me of.   I've tried it in that sense too. Didn't care for it. I don't like how sweet it is.   You monster... how dare you.  On a similar topic.

    Well hey, I like it.   I'm not sure the exact amount it gets lowered, but yes. That's basically it.   no      My point being it isn't like every other pack. Your deluxe triple cheeseburger won't end up being worth 1/16 of a shank. It will always retain the same hunger.  If you don't see the point of the change, I could make it impact hunger again :-)   I will point out that SoL only impacts saturation, not the hunger value.   I made the modpack with these mechanics in mind, just so you know. Everything is balanced around it. I used these rather than other things because, well, every other pack focuses on the same things. Hunger, tool progression, etc. I wanted to make the pack unique rather than using the formula for increased difficulty that everyone is used to.  I knew going into it people wouldn't like it. I'm not going to stop you from doing it, and I'm actually honoured that you care about the pack enough to even bother making these changes.   I'll refer to my previous posts for everyone complaining about the inventory: http://www.reddit.com/r/feedthebeast/comments/2wulyv/an_interview_about_pathfinder/cov3tgb http://i.imgur.com/lnGDnV0.png   completely intact  Hey, look at the recipes for the Energy Condenser or Transmutation Tablet.   Uh... I hope you realise I had nothing to do with this.   3   If you've used the dimlets given on the ship, and followed the grammar mentioned in the Quest Book/Dimension Manual, your world should have been normal.   The repeater. Project Red has an upgraded version of the vanilla one.   Yes.   DW20 is technically FTB. We make the pack off of his mod list, and make config changes accordingly. We basically make the pack for him to play, hence why it shows up in the main tab.  And thanks, I'm hoping to have fun here :D   Basically, Eya and I sort of swapped positions. I used to be specifically Third Party Packs (Running Red, etc), and Eyamaz would work on the official packs, such as Monster and Horizons, as well as his personal packs.  Now that's swapped. I help out with the official FTB packs, such as Mage Quest or Infinity, and he does his Third Party stuff, such as BnB.  The "Modpack Developer" position, at this point in time, means that the person controls the pack development. I'll do most of the config changes, such as configuring ore generation or changing recipes. As well, as Watchful said, I also control the various teams that help with modpacks. In the future, I'll be working with tfox to assemble modpacks and make them what they are, via config changes and the like.  For example, the past few updates for non-infinity modpacks (Lite, Mage Quest, and DW20) have been overseen by me. I sent the Maintenance team the packs, and they went through and updated the mods. I also got the new quests from the Lit. Team for Mage Quest, and then made the config changes DW20 requested for his pack.  TL;DR, Eyamaz has resigned, and I do what he did and make FTB Packs now.   Yeah, I've got that on my schedule. It's rather far down, though. I'm currently making Slowpoke some coffee and getting tfox the code to hack into the Curiosity Rover.  Normally I'd be opposed to hacking into a NASA device, but hey. We can't deny our supreme overlords anything, can we?   You need to use Servos with TD pipes to have them constantly extract.    If it includes an interesting challenge of using an actual backpack for extra inventory I'll be sold. I always liked the idea that better storage had with backpacks and putting them down/ picking them back up.  That's almost exactly what we had planned. We don't want the inventory management to hinder the game, we just want the player to think a little harder about what they are carrying around with them. The player will be able to carry around bags and such.  One of my favorite parts of Don't Starve was that you couldn't just carry everything around with you. It was entertaining to have to deal with only having the essentials on me, with everything else stored in a chest elsewhere. It provided an interesting dynamic that seemed to be lacking in Minecraft, no matter which mods you used.  Item and inventory management are things that are rarely emphasised upon in all of minecraft. Storing things in chests and sorting them becomes completely obsolete the instant an AE system is made. Inventories cease to be a problem the instant a golden bag of holding is obtained. I wanted, at least in one pack, to bring out something that most people rarely think twice about.  I figure that there's always something that will put people off of packs like this. A lot of people hated Blood 'N Bones for its tool progression, Crash Landing for its need of food, or Material Energy^4 for the insane amount of mobs. I know that whatever I change, at least one person will be unhappy with it. A lot of people didn't like the Blood Altar in Running Red (to which I responded: Why are you even playing? O.o), and quite a few didn't like the odd progression in Phoenix Reborn.  With each pack I make, I've tried to do something new. I suppose for Pathfinder, the limited inventory during the early game will be it. If everyone in general comes to the consensus that they don't like it, I'm more than happy to remove it. But as I've said - it's something that makes the pack unique and different. I hope that it will be well-liked, but if it's not, I could remove it. But until then, it will be staying.      RFTools based. Galacticraft is not even installed.   There will be   Carpenter's Blocks. Put the liquid near them, and set  B:"Routable Fluids"=true  This was actually enabled in the original Running Red, and was why it sometimes looked as if the blood was flowing past the blocks.       It glosses over a few of the things in the Dimension Building, but you can learn most of that just by reading the book and playing around with it a little. It's an amazing mod that is very easy to get into  	26
 prolly more for world politics than world news. its only loosely based on an event.. the explosion, and more based on politics.   which is probably why the downvotes.  we might not have a choice with the rockets, but we can continue this discussion in a proper place   i dont care if it gives him the best orgasm ever, the government shouldnt kill its own people. We make mistakes and its cheaper and well a worse punishment to keep them in jail for life.    i'll upvote if its about healing, and us coming back together and forgetting splits that happened before any of us were born.    i bet you can find similar quotes from similar people at the same time slavery was ended.   every notice the difference between the staff at costco versus walmart? why do you think that is? think they like cherry pick the best of the lower levels of employment? or could it be that you get a better service because the employees care more because they can feed their family on the wages paid without having to get food stamps as well?  how does it go with you guys.... "you get what you paid for" and sir you just paid for some cheap ass service.    well really, most people's complaints with CS, is when they try to leave.  well besides "Yeah, there is an outage in your area, we are working to fix it as soon as possible"  thats about it for cs.    there used to be this store near me, called blockbuster... they had similar views.  its really kinda crazy, they had all the power and resources to kick ass, except the power to change.  its 2015 and the best they have given us is that crap hulu plus.     dint [know this info, thanks](http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2015/05/white-house-sides-with-oracle-tells-supreme-court-apis-are-copyrightable/)   Do consenting adults have a right to contract with other consenting adults? Supporters of the Supreme Courts decision argue yes but they argue no when it comes to economic liberties, like contracts regarding wages.  nope, even marriage has rules. Like multiple.. and divorces and ages and so on. I cant marry a child, like you cant hire one to work the mines, rand. Both have regs, yes marriage just lost one.. no gays. it still has a ton. Example fail.  I acknowledge the right to contract in all economic and personal spheres, but that doesnt mean there isnt a danger that a government that involves itself in every nook and cranny of our lives wont now enforce definitions that conflict with sincerely felt religious convictions of others.?  and when it effects others THEY SHOULD.  why does the right get this when it comes to muslims? and banning sharia law all over the south, like that was a pressing problem?  Some have argued that the Supreme Courts ruling will now involve the police power of the state in churches, church schools, church hospitals.  yeah cause teh rulling ordered preists to do gay marriages.  No one is saying shit to them, or shit to religious schools. HOSPITALS? YEAH FUCK OFF DUDE.. thats different. AND THE GOVERNMETN SHOULD TELL THE RELIGIOUS TO FUCK OFF.. its in the public sphere.. their schools and churches are not.  more fail from rand.  he also ignores his love of contracts doesnt work if they get invalidated at state lines.  but what ever.. keep digging rand, you never had a chance anyways, and you choose to step in a pile of shit, as you make dumb ass excuses about the free market thats just going to remind people your stepping into civil rights shit, when you claimed that the free market would have cured being bigots to blacks, without forcing businesses to actually serve them.. please ignore poverty makes it hard to "vote with your feet"  rand you just convinced me you are a bigger dumb ass than i ever gave you credit for and the only reasons you are speaking is you want to help protect the bigots. Considering the white supremecist support you and your father enjoyed, it might be just best if you shut teh fuck up and stick to tax cuts and deregulation, cause thats the only shit you really care about.    ever have a divorce?   So walmart was set up.  Big fucking deal  and its the same BULLSHIT they did the last time with the anti gay cake.  The problem isnt the religious refusing to write gay and lesbian crap on cakes.. the problem was they refused to sell a cake at all. But the text on it.. that is  covered by freedom of speech and you cant make a cake maker write words they find offensive. BUT THEY HAVE TO MAKE THE CAKE.  so yeah a gay black man baker, has to make cakes for the klan/gop/w/e but they dont have to write the words on the cake.  this is more right winger retardation, just a rerun of the anti gay cake... they are allowed to do an isis cake and not a confedderate one, but both people have to get a cake.    well part of the answer is there is no one republican party. its actually a coalition of conservative groups. There is the more economic conservatives and libertarian conservatives, who tend to yell the most to keep out of peoples lives. They are joined with the authoritarian and war like conservatives... How are more into spying and keeping the country safe and dont think people have the right to privacy and tend to like a lot of laws that put people in jail and are also joined with social conservatives, who do want government interference in social issues, like abortion and gay marriage and yoga pants and drugs and ...  there is no one republican party, so you are hearing the small gov chants of one section of the party, and the calls for  abortion laws from another section.  dems have similar coalitions, there is no one real dem party  they have to do this, rather than become multiple liberal and multiple conservative parties due to first past the post voting.    this is my biggest problem with it. More than all the other crap people freak over.  it isnt national security.  Its a massive trade agreement.  Treaties are the highest law of the land akin to amendments.  the people have the right to know what our government is doing.  we are a republic, sure, cause the people can be idiots but mainly to protect minority rigths.. but also cause people would vote for services and vote against the taxes to pay for them and shit,. BUT  we have the right to be informed, and the right to lobby our reps on how they should vote and that if they dont vote our way, there could be consequences. It doesnt matter if we are actually in the wrong.   and if we cna see some of the more crazy healthcare and budget ideas.. why the fuck cant we see this? that scares me more too.  like rand paul proposes flat tax.. thats insane, would explode the deficit, we would need massive cuts and would shift the burden to the lower classes...and now I know about it, i can tell my rep hell fucking no. or for the right, the proposals to legalize those brought here as children.. who have not commited any crime since.. yall have the rigth to say "hey vote fuckign no"  but with the tpp, they arent telling us shit.    ture but  1. news of the stupid doesnt require it be current.  2. it is becoming election season and as such this info is relevant to today.    50-70 cents a day per phone.. without efforts.. can increase with a little effort.   Whats more, the updated terms of service would allow PayPal to contact users at either their designated phone number or even an undisclosed number PayPal managed to obtain through other means.   wow.. a company gets a effective monopoly and cant leave well enough alone.   according to click throughs you can opt out but not easy  Those who dont want to be autodialed can contact PayPal support to opt out.  but also they say .. not everyone has been successful,.    ER nope.    how did he get so many upvotes? do people not read? Yeah thats part of it.. fucking read the rest in paypals own words.  (v) poll your opinions through surveys or questionnaires, (vii) contact you with offers and promotions; or (viii) as otherwise necessary to service your account or enforce this User Agreement, our policies, applicable law, or any other agreement we may have with you.   unless you want to claim a poll is a security measure.. you are actually doing exactly what you are bitching about, but from the opposite spectrum.    Those who dont want to be autodialed can contact PayPal support to opt out.  no one said they were going to make it easy. Kinda shitty in my book.   probably just protesting the entire week.   what gets me, these people would like a dont_burn_the_us_flag in protest amendment, but then fly the flag of  the enemy of the union in protest every time they get.  Idk to me a little flag burning it a little less patriotically offensive, than actually flying the banner of the enemy. idk call me crazy. but one seems more like a complaint and the other seems more like a threat.    damn you science and your limits.   yeah us cows in merica say moo, them french ones say meuh, finish amuuuuu, germans mmuuuhh, japanese mao mao.  [i dont really need a source, but for the rest of you](http://www.eleceng.adelaide.edu.au/personal/dabbott/animal.html)    his investments in carbon also dont have an effect on its use. Demand and government regulation does. and the "you could do more" game is always a loser.  but everyone on the planet could sell every oil related stock they have and it wouldnt effect our use of gas. Investing in the energy sector isnt the same as venture capital into a new project. Losing investments would never kill big oil, they already make a little of their own money.   true.  But i do rank people like that in my mind.  People who believed in it before the ruling people who accept it after the ruling the people still fighting and crying about it.  pandering is better than digging in your heals. i'm a dem but i will say this comment is better than some of the others i have heard from the right on this issue.    yep, heard it for years and thats about as much as you get. "he seems like it". But i would add, its more than not been married, he hasnt been known to really date either. i'm not trying to tilt the favor towards "he's gay".. but obviously if he had a different lady on his shoulder every week the "not married" wouldnt suggest gay in some peoples minds.  I couldnt care much less if he is or isnt. If he is and wants to come out, i hope he can some day. but i dont really consider him being fancy or single, means hes gay..   What Googles doing, in these cases, is using its deep pockets in the interest of broader social ends, with seemingly little concern for short-term returns.  maybe short term, but lets not forget what google is, its an advertising and media company. Having a better infrastructure for silly cat videos is good for google. more and more people substitute youtube for tv. They might have good social intentions as well, but this sentence makes it sound like they are being selfless, and thats not true.   I think you mean as far as the line speed goes. FIOS and all and your mostly correct about that. but patent issues do always slow everything down a little.. but wasnt a huge deal with fios. but even if your idea is unique you got to do patent searches. But its been minor in bandwidth, and bringing high speeds to the people.  but the rest.. nah patents have been a big thorn in technology. There was a massive battle to build up patent portfolios when all the lawsuits started to happen. the big fears for small time developers is that they dont have the same access to a massive patent nuke of their own to protect them from lawsuits. Its definitely an issue. Slightly less today as some patent trolls were shut down by some various rulings, but yeah they were fucking up shit for a while  and then their are other countries fucking shit up.. like the iphone5 was patented by a clone maker in china before apple patented it...costing them a ton of money they might rather spend on research.      well thats why governments tend to be the pioneers into the high risk unknowns and commercial interests come in afterwards and bring it to the people.  Gov explores, maps the wilds, puts up roads and commercial interests build the homes and businesses around it.  same with net, and space. unfortunately with net, they decided to stop branching out.. and luckily google though help with the government, stepped into some markets to inject competition.(sigh living near a google city, just an hour drive north they get 5 times my speed for the same price i pay)    yeah its a bit odd given the context. She might have bigger identity fears though.. however the problem isnt women covering up, its the lack of choice. If she wants to wear her face thing, thats a triumph of freedom as long as she can take it off if she wants as well.    not that hard actually but reddit might complain.  there are 'reddit clones" and i mean of the data.. sorta. I believe they just use the reddit api.. i used to have a rainlender desktop where i pulled in all the posts from my fav subreddits to be my desktop backgound. they were clickable and all that. could either go to the link or the comments.  but the point is, they could pull in through the feed the reddit posts.. though reddit probably would have a legit complaint over that, especially using their own software to do it. but voat could pull in just the posts and leave separate an area for us to comment.  and here are a couple reddit feed pages. and yeah i know not the same as cloning reddit. but the point is there are ideas they could possibly work on though legality might be issues.  [redditjs](https://redditjs.com/) (this one just kinda mods the interface, click grid and crap on top.. its cool)  and [aggreddit](http://aggreddit.com/?r=reddit.com+pics+politics+WTF+funny+programming+science+technology) (this one you set up the reddits with the link. like this one http://aggreddit.com/?r=reddit.com+pics+politics+WTF+funny+programming+science+technology)  and [redddit in real time](http://erqqvg.com/)  there are a few others.    a small suggestion, since you seem passionately involved. I am going to assume for not, that you have a better idea of the contents of the TPP than say the generally public, since its been mostly kept a secret. And yeah there have been leaks and such. But you might want to pretend that people dont know anything at about it, each and every time you complain about being deleted or banned.  Like   I hope they're not in college yet, because the TPP will cripple students.  wow sounds scary.. how is a trade agreement going to do that? honest. I dont know. I heard some on the copyright and some on the laws, i question, but most people i know dont know a damn thing.  These days, i hear more about the battle between yall and /r/polices and /r/news than i do the actual contents of the agreement. And thats not really good for your movement.  and yeah i know those are the places you would like to educate people and so part of that is hampering you on getting out your message... which is why you should be detailed in your complaints about deletes. Some of us dont know enough about it.  right now i am against it from what i heard, but yall go off on a lot of stuff, thats just not common knowledge yet and yall should work at making it so.  for me my biggest problem with the thing is being kept in the dark, this isnt war, this isnt national security, this is a trade agreement we have the right to know and lobby our reps to do what we think is right, even if it isnt. Even if our country loses power.. if we decide as a country we dont want to go in that direction, we shouldnt.(and unfortunately, i actually accept that on ideas that i would like to see passed.. its the american way, good or bad)   not only that, its a horse shit claim.  I can easily show how after connecticut closed the gun show loophole and put some restrictions on guns, saw a drop in murders by 40% over a ten year period. Now some of that is with the decline in murders us wide, but theirs was a bigger drop.  i can also show were missouri recently to show how anti left they were, got rid of some background checks and saw a 23% increase in murders.  most liberals.. just want to see the gun show loopholes which makes it totally easy for criminals to by pass background checks and get guns to get closed to make the law we put on the books back when reagan was shot, to actuallty be effective. Increasing background checks it not "letting only the criminals get guns". If you arent a criminal you can pass a  background check.  (and before someone says anything private sale loophole what ever you want to call it, but dont insult anyones intelligence by saying it dont exist.)  only a tiny minority of liberals want to go the english route of no guns.  What he is doing is as wrong as claiming all republicans think womens bodies shut down in rape so any women who get pregnant while being raped must have wanted it.  obviously only a small subset of extremist republicans feel that way.  well its the same but on the left with "gonna ban all guns"     Its not really deceptive as long as you know they are measuring it by the country.  it is odd since the title of the link, is a bit deceptive to the 'left" of agw science... while the graphics sorta can appear deceptive towards the right. since it looks like "hey agw is no big deal here and fuck africa".. I get that. But its more about resolution. Posted without the text explaining that, then yeah.. its very deceptive, but otherwise its a difference of resolution.  I have to assume due to the title choosen for the article, that they were not trying to be deceptively denialist. Otherwise it would be "agw is not as big of a deal as you think.. look what countries will do ok"   and probably the most important line from the entire article.   In other words, the best-ranked countries are only as great as they seem compared against the countries that arent performing so well.  its going to fuck us bad.. in costs.. for sure.. evacuate miami? lol easier to type but we are a wealthy nation and will do better, as far as direct climate effects than others. There is other worries about how the world will react  as climate change gets worse and we might have more to worry about from the war/terrorism front... then some countries    /r/tronscript  might be some help   I think aol spent more on advertising than anything else. you could hardly get out of your driveway due to all the discarded discs.    op here.. thanks.. post removed.   eh at least its posted here and not somewhere serious.  interesting read and some of it is probably true. but on issues like this, its a huge warning sign for you to use the views of a single person from that group.... and one that has been transplanted out of the area for a good bit of theri lives.   not saying they are wrong, but there has been a few black people who think taking down the confederate flag was wrong and harmed black people, by being petty over heritage and reinforcing the angry black man... not my thoughts in the least, but you can easily see and article "black man says keep the flag up, black people dont care'  and well you are missing the story.  OK back to the claim   Reading the click throughs are better at understanding this claim, then the article link, and i can see the concept as possible. However  if i say jews control all the money.. like some bigots like to do.. its still anti semetic, even if i wouldnt mind if it was me to control all teh money. So just cause i aspire to become that which i condemn, doesnt make it not bigotry always.  and last.. you do know its kinda bigoted to say all south koreas wishes they were money grubbing and careless about others? Even if you find one that pines to be attacked on those ideas. and you cant debunk a scientific conclusion with "i feel this is so" the scientific conclusion which COULD BE WRONG. that sk is bigoted because of the view they have.. to debunk this you got to show that SKn also hold the views that eventually they want to have these traits as well.. which means another study and not.. i met this dude who was like this and so all south koreans are like this.         it is, but in america it is nearly impossible to have any civilized debate on the prison issue because one side refuses to and justifies everything by "that dude was evil".. doesnt matter if there is a better more effective way.. doesnt matter what science says.  shit look at all the people pissed the fuck off about how much it costs to keep someone in jail for life,   A. ignoring it costs more to kill them.  and big for me.  B. these same people dont trust the government to do a god damn thing right, but when it kills its own people they are holy perfect.  so good luck talking about the conditions of solitary or how other countries do it.. or how our crime isnt worse than say frances, and yet per capita we put about 10 times as many people in jail.  we have a problem in this society and just trying to do smart things with the laws will get you labeled as a murder defender, or callous or w.e.. fuck even defence attorneys get attacked just for doing their job.     On the other hand he has every incentive to sell prison employees out just to be a dick.  nope the exact opposite dude.  he has every incentive on the planet to not say shit.  how are you going to get more help to escape in the future.. if you rat out the guards?  nah.. he wouldnt say shit.      well now I am confused.  You can keep wifi on the router for people with wifi.. and just disable it on the computer.  family can still use it.  unless you are trying to use your computer as a router? and want people to connect to your computer via wifi and go through your computer and out its ethernet? that can be done, but easier to just disable wifi on the computer and leave wifi on the router for family.   When I turn it off, the computer uses ethernet, but when it's on, wifi is used.  at least we know it isnt hardware.    holycrap.. and this is the dailymail?  Just how the title.. not surprised they reported it but normally the title wouldnt have been so ..non attacking.     running an iphone5 24/7 for an entire year is 41 cents. less than 4 cents a month. If your phone is crappier than an iphone5.. this number will most likely be lower.  ipads are less than $2 for 24/7 .. full year.   now laptops and tablets can get a bit more, seeing about $8 a year.. depending on models.  netbooks are going to tend to use less.  [for most of us, elect shouldnt even be a thought.](http://blog.opower.com/2012/09/how-much-does-it-cost-to-charge-an-iphone-5-a-thought-provokingly-modest-0-41year/)  i mean if your making less than 8 dollars a year in beer money.. 9in order for a laptop to be profitable) you might try something else.      you really have all the info you need at hand, you are just asking for someone to tell you what to do. Its up to you man.  basically your going to hear two things.. i hacked and made a more money and didnt get caught.. versus i hacked and got banned, losing all ability to earn this easy beer money.  its classic risk reward... with unfortunately a random unknown.. you getting caught.  so is it worth it to you, the extra money you get per month 'hacking'. knowing you can get ip banned and lose the ability to work with perk, to keep doing it.  basically and this is a bit over the top.. but its the same idea, basically you are saying "i rob stores for extra money, i read in the paper that people get busted for this shit.. should i still rob stores" ok punishments are worse and rewards are greater... but its the same idea.    like all others.  you get a link.  give link to friend.  friend clicks on link  friend signs up for perk  when friend redeems first reward..(read.. ACTUALLY uses the service.. they have to do this because its easy to automate sign ups.. and they want real people with real phones, actually perking)  you get your points.    well you remember them pranksters? that tend to go to massive global business forums?  who made the proposal of letting the poor eat shit.. basically they claimed to have come up with a method of extracting nutrients from shit and turning it into hamburgers we could sell to the worlds poor.  the [yes men](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZP_nNemsNT8)   so by priority you mean the metrics?  hmm.. if you did metrics should have worked.  You can always disable the wifi adaptor in device manger or in the  change adaptor settings(probably best here)  if that kills your net.. and a reboot dont clear it up.. you probably have a problem with the ethernet.. since you bought a new router, i would check the cables first.    why? its a good question? it helps further show how their true ideology is hate and bigotry and has shit to do with religion.  No i am sure they THINK they are religious, but basically they warped religion into a perfectly fitting body wrap around themselves. Thats not religion, thats clinically insane narcissism. They are basically saying they are the perfect example of what god wants to see in a human being, even if the bible says shit about the crap they do. because that doesnt count, the only things in the bible that count are shit other people do that he doesnt like.   it doesnt matter all the rest, any of it. lying stealing, killing, working on sundays, multiple marriages.. none of it for themselves, but for other people...  they are cherry picking bigots who want to shove theri own personal version of their religion down our throats while ignoring all the crap theri bible says about shit they do that they ignore. and the biggest is probably bearing false witness.  And last tell me this, if they are so fucking pious, so fucking religious the get pissed when someone doesnt say marry christmas. So fucking religious we got to tip toe arround offended them like they have some crazy person....why the fuck dont they threaten to set themselves on fire because the state lets people work on sundays in non emergency jobs? that shit was written in stone, i would think their god would think it was important.  nah they are bigots and liars.. and trump is helping people see that.   I get what you are saying the 10th.. right? The problem with that idea, is that constitution, is the constitution has a lot of other crap in it. Like how to AMEND the constitution and who gets finally say on what is constitution.(which you can override with an amendment)  Now.. this amendment process, honors the people like you who since the beginning of this country have screamed states rights. ITs actually honors the 10th amendment. Why? because amendments have to be ratified by 3/4ths of the states  level legislators AS well as pass the federal senate and house..  So the states, Under the protection of the 10th amendment agreed to the equal protection clause in the 14th amendment. This is where the fed doesnt get any powers not delegated to it. WEll the states gave the fed the power over "equal protection". The supreme court who decides what they meant, says its their jurisdiction and its their power to actually decide if its their jurisdiction via the constitution.  your tenth amendment rights were protected under both rulings. You have the right to over rule EITHER.. EITHER.. we can make black people slaves again.. NO SHIT.(well besides black people might not like that idea much) but it would take an amendment to the constitution. and 3/4th of the states to give the power back to the states. Now it is actually possible for scotus to find a new amendment unconstitutional but that is an untested legal theory as to what would actually happen in that case.   but yeah, just make an amendment saying states have the sole power to define marriage, and get 3/4s of the countries statehouse to agree.     well they werent wholly wrong, he did say some very questionable things at the start, that made it seem like he was going to rule very much in the telecoms favor.   I was only pointing out the flip.    Sorry the title misrepresents the study a bit too much.  1/3 of the largest reservoirs are being used faster than they can recover. they are over stressed.  that is not the same as 1/3 being depleted as in gone.    maybe.. especially in states that already legalized. the i got mine, dont give a shit about you and probably cry states rights.. yeah my state did it.. move here if you dont like yours.  and ... well there are probably some gays that like the excuse that its illegal in that it keeps their relationship open. Ok thats a bit petty but there are heteros that dont want to get married but are under constant pressure to do so.. see canadian storage wars.  WEll i bet she(the girl who keeps saying no on csw) might like the easier excuse,"i would marry you but its illegal" Its a bit more than petty to say its a bad decision because you have cold feet.. but its plausible. Some republican gay who has been using it as an excuse to his partner for ages, now has none.   he votes how alito votes.   1 of them joined the left. so  one is kinda mainstream. it was 5  to 4 with all the left joining kennedy.    i wasnt talking religion, just people who kill themselves to protest something. [And that most are a form of protest against a powerful oppressive government](http://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/a-terrible-act-of-reason-when-did-self-immolation-become-the-paramount-form-of-protest)  and while more prevalent in the east, the west, has seen a ton as well. but christians did it in rome, and russia, and various christians have done it but not for christian causes and at least one to protest war in the us.    and thats good.. fast track isnt inherently  bad.. some of the rules they added to it is bad. Fast track is the way it actually has always been.   You should not be able to amend the treaty and send it back.  you should be able to make recommendations and demands that the president secure, before negotiations. But you give treaties up or down votes. Thats because there are too many legislators involved in too many countries. WE would never have gotten any multi country treaty passed without fast track.  it simply says no amendments and the treaty gets a vote on the floor.  the secrecy and contents suck balls, but fast tracks the way its got to be.. in all big treaties.. maybe between two . or three countries.. but even then we are talking 2000 reps each with political goals and agendas.. much bigger than that, its wholly impossible.   edit; ok we can debate a bit on the "this treaty gets a vote" because it removes the ability to filibuster, which to me isnt as bad as adding amendments and can be killed with enough votes. But the rest of fast track is a good thing. (and yeah filibusters have been more than abused just to pass minor things, but something like this, i say filibuster is fair game)     remember when reddit wanted to tar and feather wheeler? pepperidge farm remembers.    actually this is typical.  the haters who scream they will do this never do.. its the ones who have a powerful feeling of sacrifice for others, in the face of some oppressing force... like tibet, china  haters tend not to. And you can kinda see why, their lives tend to be governed by fear.    "true conservative"?  sorry but i disagree, you can have conservative religious. and you can have conservative authoritarians.  your brand of true conservative, which sounds pretty libertarian preaches less government intrusion.  unfortunately your brand of conservatism, is only a small part of the republican party which represents you.  Not attacking, same with progressives, we can have authoritarian progressives, and religious progressives, and non religious progressives. states rights progressives. but unfortunately for us, while we tend to have more social conservative progressives, we dont have as many economic and legislative progressives as many of us would like.  i am surprised there isnt more infighting in the gop because their coalition has so many opposite views.  but basically the gop is economic conservatives, mixed with authoritarian and religious conservatives.     allah is the arabic word for god. Or "THE GOD OF ABRAHAM".. yeah that abraham.. same dude.  they are both abrahamic religions. Allah = yahweh = god  Same god, different language. Period.  Now muslisms came after christians and much like mormons today, they tend to not see them as following the same faith. but islam is just judaism and the torah + christianity and the bible + the quran and muhammad.  much like mormons are judaism + christianity, + the book of mormon and joe smith.  they are just additions to the existing religion. Same god, all 3.  now as a matter of faith, you can claim its a bastardization of the abrahamic religion.. but like it or not, they claim to worship the exact same dude.        all religions are.  and sorry if you think the muslims are the only ones acting bat shit crazying and killing non believers you havetn been to christian africa, it just doesnt make the news as much for us, because it isnt very strategic.  the muslims were actually very enlightened when the christians pushed us in the dark ages. They lead the word for intellectual advancement and protected a lot of knowledge from destruction. They had a resurgence of right wing, lets go back to the past, science is afront to god, type folks, that put islam into its own sort of dark ages, part of that was helped by the west when we went down to the middle east and fucked the place all up which helped the more militant right winger muslims to rise a few dozen times in history, but part of it was islam itself. But it is no different that christianity as far as "outdatedness".. and there are many muslim nations that are quite progressive, especially in asia. you are just looking at the right winger version when you see the violence and offense and religious control over every day life.. much like our right would like to do in the us.    2 people attacked by shark off the coast of SC.  right? left? inbetween?  There can be non political news, but I do agree that most is.    nope.. it suggests that it does IN FACT reduce how much insurance companies have to pay out for claims.  its not the same as what you are suggesting which they do do for other things... let me put it this way.  jenny the drinker slips on wet floor, hurts back, sues for workmans comp, passes drug test gets 50k  tommy stoner, slips at the exact same time, on the exact same floor, but get drug tested. The insurance companies will claim it was the drugs that influenced his fall so they dont have to pay him 50k  it has nothing to do with drug tests working.  it has to do with using drug tests to get out of paying.  if you want to say they work at saving insurance companies and the businesses that hirer them, money, then yeah.. they work for that, but they are sold for productivity reasons.    well thats generally what happens when you make less work injury claims.    well I will if he only uses blogs and youtubes to make his case.  I don't share your faith in government and large institutions.  big business kinda disagrees, its government who are the pioneers, after they access the situation, the commercial markets move in. See commercial markets dont like entering areas where the risk is highly unpredictable, the government is less hampered and as such, thats why they were the first in near earth orbit, but now its time for the commercial enterprises to take advantage of the info the government provided so they can successfully fulfill market needs. (and yeah i saw the neil degrasse talk)    We don't have a realistic method to produce that much bacteria  i think the point is it would feed and breed on mars.. bacteria dont really need us to produce a ton, it would just take a lot longer for the colonies to grow.  but i suspect we would send relatively little.. and yeah maybe someone can debunk this idea and say "yeah but it would tkae 2 million years to reach critical levels" idk.. but i know that shit breeds fast.    NZ finds Black Cocks hard to swallow  lol media.  Not quite the same but in south carolina with the gamecocks.. everything is cocks. girls all wear pants with cocks on the butt.  our horse cocks won the equestrian national championships.  our lady cocks kicked ass in basketball.  heck even our disc cocks  kicked some butt this year tossin the frisbees.  three wet cocks are going to the national diving competition.  running cocks, sandy cocks.. and so on... we are a bit childish but idc.  edit: my bad the volleyball team is the sandy cocks.. fixed   interesting, i had always heard prescott bush was part of that. came from the bbc. Now i dont see any credible links.. just ones on sites like prison planet.. its still claimed in a single bbc radio program and can find it no where else.. cant even seem to find their sources.  anyone have any credible info, before i file this under my 'unproven conspiracy, dont use' box in my mind?   nope. We do get you have a hate for the man, so your view is horribly colored.  Let me hazard an easy guess, but i suspect you dont happen to be an obama supporter? that you probably agree more with the right of the aisle? is this a fair assessment? not saying you are a republican, just not left? and let me guess fdr mae the depression worse?    it wouldnt matter if it was when he sucked hitlers dick.  the comment is about a president giving an eloquent fuck you to his detractors. the guy posting it doesnt even say he is a supporter.   it doesnt have to do with politics as much as kick ass fuck you'n  and yeah a lot of the left was fucked up and bigoted as fuck before the civil rights era.. tell me do we have to discount all of history and say absolutely and none of it was good until say after the  race riots of the 60s? fuck back then republicans were the anti bigots.. now the head of the republican party in the house(not the speaker but the lead of the party) was a speaker at a white supremacist group which he claims was a different meeting held at the same time and place with the same people but on different subjects.  anyways lets get back to beautiful fuck yous.  like i said the GOP used to be the anti bigots.. maybe you can find a famous GOPr like lincoln or something telling the bigots off eloquently. I'll upvote that shit. Or fuck, idk, it could be bush jr, who i hate, if you find a good speech, and i agree it was a good fuck you.. Up votes are heading your way   and they never stopped hating him   more [info for those who want to know what he is talking about](http://www.politico.com/story/2014/04/joe-biden-gay-marriage-white-house-response-105744.html)  Vice President Joe Biden really did get ahead of President Barack Obama on accepting gay marriage in 2012  and the White House really wasnt happy about it, despite the two leaders many attempts to claim otherwise. ..  Thats the story laid out in Jo Beckers new book, Forcing the Spring, which documents the past few years of successful efforts to expand the legalization of gay marriage, according to an advance copy obtained by POLITICO.  biden might still get some credit historically. Obama def will get the most as he was president, but the gay community will probably learn of and know of bidens contributions in future studies.     yeah, in my area it bugs me a bit, due to recession we cut back.. no more mosquito spraying.. but we sure as fuck put up christmas decorations every year.. and yeah we own them and probably dont have to replace too much but it takes a fuck ton of workers to put that shit up all over town and take down.    i'm sure teh gov has some gels for various reasons, including entertainment. you will find them on military bases in the clubs and such. he might have gotten his own, but its not like the gov doesnt have them.   some  dude in bathrobe with a beard loves trucks... its hilarious how much reverence they give to an impossible image. Even if you think his skin wasnt that dark, his facial  features  as displayed are decidedly from north of those parts from which he was said to reside.    It also doesnt matter that much.  there are rich people that lobby for higher taxes and yet still pay the rate it is today.  you can complain about the communication laws, trying to oppen the system up more, while being part of it.. like tmobile did some with tower sharing   you can claim walmart is killing the place without doubling your employees pay and trying to compete with your much smaller buying power.  its not necessarily hypocritical.. and yeah it is a bit different if it is a advocacy group but like people mentioned, it goes up to 15 quickly.  and you can be a smoker and advocate stricker laws, the big hypocrisy happens when you dont let people know you are a smoker as well and instead get caught    is ti wrong? or cruel? I mean if you get the woman to stop destroying the thing further.. is that a bad thing? in court they are going to list the cost of repair. I dont think she would have listened if he said.. hey stop doing that. but she might listen if he said something stupid.    yeah i dont doubt the idea between federal power and states rights has been a long fought over idea. But really with anyone saying that, point them to the confederate constitution. It gives itself supremecy over the confederate states. STRONG FED... that lost only the power to ban slavery.  They actually edited the lines above and below the supremacy clause in the us constitution but left the actual supremacy clause in theirs.  how can it be about states rights, when their own constitution set up the exact same fed as the US constitution, sans the right to ban slavery.  and here is the thing..  [banning slavery didnt start the war. Banning expanding slavery into the new territories into the west did.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Civil_War) No one told the south they couldnt have slaves.. but that the slave trade couldnt expand out west.   even when lincoln did his [emancipation proclamation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emancipation_Proclamation) which was after the war had started. ALL it actually did ws change the federal legal status of slaves. SO that if a slave escaped a slave holder state, he would not be forced by the courts to be returned as property. and due to quirks in presidential rights during war time... he could only apply the proclamation to states in active rebellion.. so only a few were actually freed by lincolns actions.. the rest were freed near the end of the war with an actual amendment process which you cant compain federal power, since it requires 3/4ths of the state houses to agree   it did not apply to those in the four slave states that were not in rebellion (Kentucky, Maryland, Delaware, and Missouri    You know, I could respect her praise if she admitted she made a mistake and has grown on the subject like many other American.  so you dont think she is doing better than the GOP in the fact that she isnt trying to make an amendment overturning the ruling.  No where did i claim she meant it.. just that she accepts it.  You can at least grasp that right? The GOP are continuing the war, she put down the pitchfork. She can still believe what she believes, but sorry I WILL SAY IT IS A GOOD THING, when someone puts down teh pitch fork.. even for bullshit.. non real reasons. The fact is she is no longer dressed in the enemies uniform shooting at us. Why she isnt I dont give a fuck.. the fact she isnt is good.  But i do appreciate your response. Unlike the rest.  I am no fucking hilary fan.. i wonder about the clinton bush reagan connections especially when it comes to the CIA and drugs.. You do know the cia planes that did the iran contra drug smuggling used arkansas airports while bill was gov..   **But i am going to say, I am 10000000% correct, that someone not attacking us is better than someone attacking us. And I dare anyone to prove me wrong.**    yeah ISIS is a bastion of gay rights.. that should have given someone a clue.. that maybe.. just maybe, they might need to look closer.  Like if you saw a black rights march, will 90% black people and suddenly some come by, carrying a confederate flag.. it might give pause, but if you see no one in the march.. upset in the least.. well you might need to look closer at that flag.  PS occupy wallstreet loves to fly the 'corporate america" flag for similar reasons. A quick view might seem 'hey they are celebrating america. when a closer view says 'no they are, upset at how corporatist america has become.  much like the dildo isis flag and they made it because isis says the same shit you hear american republican say on a daily basis when it comes to gays.    not really sure where to post politics r/politics doesnt approve of.  and like it or not this does have to do with politics.       i dont doubt really.. its not really a complex symbol..i'm sure it has been accidentally drawn in the past by people just making random shapes.   yeah thats part of my point. This is being spammed everywhere because the GOP think they can make points by pointing out that she was against gay marriage just like them.  but she changed .. at least her rhetoric, they did not.   i know her stance, my point of being vague was to apply it to all people left or right who you can find with a video denouncing gay marriage back in the past. How they felt in the past is less important than if they accept it now.  hey in my state, many of the politicians who now support bringing the flag down, supported the flag. Call me crazy, but I am going to give them a little praise, even though they are opposite ideology, for growing with the times, and condemn louder the people who dont.  You just cant expect a huge societal change like this and just condemn everyone who was ever against it til the end of time, even if they accept it now.  more downvotes and no debate, I see my detractors have no abilities to defend themselves   Clinton charity took up to $10 MILLION donation from African church which called homosexuals 'devils' - despite Hillary's support for gay marriage  her charity accepted money from an anti gay church. a charity she set up but doesnt run and so what? should charities do a background check on everyone who ever donates and give back any money that comes from questionable sources?  do you think a black family wouldnt appreciate food at a food bank given by the klan? and how does that say "we support this group" by taking their charitable contributions.  you might have a point if it was to the campaign.. but this is charity.. they take what they can get and they dont care if you are hitler, the money helps people. no charity would ever return money from an anti what ever.. its not the same as a political donation where you have the fears of like mindedness.    fair enough, but i have lived from nyc to sc, been from cali to texas to washington.. and I have heard the term double park about a million times and have never heard it used for anything besides talking about someone taking up two spaces. Even in NYC. but i have also not been to an area where they are doing this 'double parking"(wiki def)  I guess its the difference between colloquial language and the proper defs.  but honestly i think most american redditors would agree, that the main way they have heard and used the term is for someone taking up two spaces.  thanks for the info that, didnt know the proper def.   [Hillary Clinton Praises Gay Marriage Decision and Hounds GOP](http://time.com/3938898/hillary-clinton-gay-marriage/)  [GOP presidential hopefuls deride gay marriage ruling, but differ on what to do about it](http://www.startribune.com/court-decisions-highlight-political-challenges-facing-gop/310250271/)  vote me into the ground if you want, but if you cant admit their is a difference between her response to the ruling and  the rights, you have a problem, not me. And not sure how you missed my first comment was about after the ruling, since i specifically mentioned people whining about it.. and not about her feeling prior. As for the date, that was the date of the video.  thats what my comment was about.. if she would accept the ruling and grow.. or attack the ruling like the right.  LIKE IT OR NOT SHE FUCKING PRAISED THE FUCKING RULING.  she is showing growth.  But hey why recognize that and praise someone for taking the first steps.. and instead pretend she is like the neanderthals talking about making an amendment to over turn it. Yeah thats a great way to advance the cause.   edit: hey downvoter.. dont want to debate? so your saying we should attack the people formerly against gay marriage who accept the ruling today, as much as the people fighting ot overturn it.. and you think that is helpful? I see they can downvote but not debate the issue, which suggests to me they dont have the capacity to support their position and are just downvoting out of spite.     well you do know that the satanic bible was based on her writings, so says the author. Said satanism was basically randianism wrapped up in ceremony. not that it matters much but it is amusing considering the party that most embrasses her is highly christian.    yeah she was against gay marriage when the majority of the country was. So was Obama. The real point, is do they grow and change with the times, like some have, or do they do like others and scream and yell about how its an affront to society?  [Hillary Clinton Praises Gay Marriage Decision and Hounds GOP](http://time.com/3938898/hillary-clinton-gay-marriage/)  downvoters say she never changed. Yeah this speach sounds just like the one in 2004. the point is people who ACCEPT IT and grow versus people who fight it.    For me it doesnt matter really what it meant during the civil war. Its how it was used since. And it was mainly used by the klan before it was put up everywhere protesting desegregation.   and heres the thing, the swastika, used to be a sanskrit symbol meaning "well being".. people dont take kindly to it today, no matter how well being you think you are. Its not what it used to mean, its what it means today.  he could be 100% correct, it should still come down.  (side note, awful used to mean something that filled you with awe(like a general or king), try using it as a compliment today.. shit changes)   I moved to the south in HS a long long time ago. And that was one culture shock for me. At least where i lived in the north, there wasnt a lot of thought about the civil war.. it just was this war a long time ago. And we didnt really think of the divide. but when i came south, it was a bigger deal. not that thats all they talked about, but it was more important and they also saw themselves as more of a separate part of the us..not separated but a unique entity.. Than we did up north. To me living up north it was just geographic, but down south is the south.  and yeah i was taught it was all about states rights and questions of federal power. and many slaves fought for the south. and it was a strain between the industrialized north and the farming south that had been brewing since before we were even a country.. going back to the original disagreements when setting up the constitution over federal versus states power.     it isnt that cut and dry and they are only trying to expand an existing service started by reagan. The phone program. TV is also considered a right which is why the government gave out the digital antenna to anyone who asked for one.  a lot of social services is moving online and that saves us money. As well as education and job services. and this isnt for everyone just the extreme poor and most of them will only get money off to buy internet.  one of the selling points giving them phones was they could get jobs. Now most of that, even the crap you find from the state offices, is all online and want online submissions.  but seriously if you say that, you dont have kids. You cant have a kid get educated today, without the net. half their lessons are online crap.  which is why so many schools give all students laptops.  welcome to the future.      and they are talking about expanding the government subsidized phone service started by reagan, to include information access. So people have to tools to better themselves while working a min wage job when they cant afford to go to college.   they arent talking about net for all.. or even most of us and even then, most of the people who do get it, will only get money off their bill.  its not quite how people are putting it like everyone in the us will get free net. its expanding a telecommunications program that already exists to include data.  you can still disagree but its only for people way below the poverty line and believe it or not more and more social service are being done online and that saves us money, but the poor have to find a kinkos or somewhere to email or fax the forms.      actually you're wrong. telephone access is a basic human right according to our law. his comments were made to the idea of expanding that right to include internet.  They are talking about expanding the phone subsidy program for the poor, to include information access. what people stupidly call obamaphones.. as it started under reagan.  and since we are in ... cordcutters, tv is also a right, which is why the gov gave out all them free digital antennas cause so many of our people still get tv over the airwaves.. cause they cant afford cable.      I'm actually surprised roberts been so vocal and so stupid in most his comments. I'm surprised that i actually agree with alito.. yes people will and have compared it to mixed marriages. CONGRATS for figuring that out. It didnt take the ruling though for us to figure that out.  and yes people who disagree with it will be labeled bigots by society.. which is the choice of society. Nothing forbids you from being a bigot. and to go back to his previous analogy, at one time it wasnt considered bigotry to think of black people as lesser people, our society as a majority accepted it. And times changed and now we call those hold outs to ancient ways, bigots. now in my opinion they always were but the point is it is society that actually decides if that label is appropriate. and... that doesnt take a ruling either.. cause we have been calling them ignorant bigots long before scotus said a word. but he is correct, they will have to put up with the growing reality that society see them as bigots.     you kind of have to..  "sacrifices in vain" and such. like darkeox say, its why he got shot.     the only moving part is the fan, so its the fan.  is there a danger of damage? sure.. it needs to keep the caps cool. It really depends on the psu, some handle wider temp ranges, but its summer and if gaming you will be taxing it.. and if its making noise air flow is probably compromised.  it wont explode.. but it might die.. i'm not even going to say the probability is high(short term).. but if you leave it like that for a long time, yeah.  make sure it is the psu fan and make sure nothing got sucked up in there thats just making noise by the fan hitting it.  you can probably think of it as noisy cv joints, or a squealing brakes.. sure you can drive but if you do a lot and tax it hard they can fail. and more so the cheaper they are.    just cause [i wanted to verify some info..here is the response.](http://blogs.columbian.com/all-politics-is-local/case-closed-on-madores-silly-park-job/).  you can see in the pict, just to the left of that space is the turn for going to the other side. They say cars keep getting clipped.   though i kinda question the reasoning.. [since he used to just double park](http://blogs.columbian.com/all-politics-is-local/madores-park-job-is-meme-of-the-day/)  but to be fair, that is a shit spot to park.  and anyways it is plausible enough looking at that first pict, that i will put away my tar and feathers for now.(and uber dem here. so no not being biased)     its not quite the same.. But i get your gist, people will drink diet drinks while consuming far too many calories and think the diet drink is helping. however this is just random observations.  [I figure the downvotes are due to it being inconclusive on why their is a positive correlation between drinking diet soda and waist size gain in older adults.](http://www.science20.com/news_articles/diet_soda_frequency_linked_to_waist_size_increases-154618)  I believe they arent sure if its has something to do with the alternative sugars and their digestibility, or does the ingestion of diet coke change eating habits.  er from a different link  In the new study, the researchers said that it is not clear exactly why drinking diet soda may be linked to an increase in waist circumference. But it may have something to do with the sweeteners used in diet soda, and the way they may affect food-intake regulation, Fowler said.      I think there is probably at least some of that. Where people think that means dieting.  But i bet some of it is just from,  at least i am doing something. Not that they feel it is actually dieting.  It gives people some feel good about themselves when they arent actually really doing much at all. "i may not be exercising but at least i eat a fitness bar now and then, sure its not enough but its better than not doing anything"  its more about a small excuse to not feel as bad about not exercising.  and of course this is all just conjecture but I see some of myself in that in other subjects (too skinny for the diet concerns) but where i do just enough to feel better about not doing all of what i should. and you use it to help you excuse doing things you used to. "Damn i am running late for work and dont want to take the morning jog(hard), but i will eat this fitness bar at least"...(easy) and eventually the hard stuff gets less while you never miss that easy chocolatey bar.      a little off but basically it.  The people.. told the legislators that they couldnt do it anymore.  they said the government must hire someone else.  This was done by referendum. These are little questions you can vote for at voting time. Like should we switch to this commision to draw districts, yes or no. Now this question is automatically added by the people, if enough people sign petitions to get them added.  the legislators who had the power removed from them, by the people. They didnt have any part of the referendum process, that was put on the ballots by the people and voted on by the people. The legislators simply lost the power to set the lines and were ordered to hire this commission to do it.  they are suing to get back the power, saying the US constitution says the job is the various state legislators(depending on how you read it) and cant be changed by vote by the people, without an amendment process. They are saying the referendum vote cant be binding in this case due to federal supremecy       Each representative in Congress is basically there to speak for a limited number of people  it used to be much more limited. in 1800. each representative averaged 30k constituents. now it is 700k per rep. Of course had we kept the same numbers we would need a much bigger house, as it would have to hold 10,000 reps and their aids.     well you are commenting in a thread where arizona is trying to change the method of gerrymandering... now they definitely arent selecting the condorcet method or anything close, but the fact is they are TRYING TO CHANGE IT. California did manage to change theirs.  i dont think we can dismiss that one day we can change it..  ok so they arent changing very far though.. i mean its light years from condorcet and not that far from normal.. but small changes can eventually lead to dramatic ones.      well it does, after gerrymandering an area, what you tend to get is far more conservative/liberal people. the next census, it is these people who get to set the lines. yeah, sometimes the people can overcome even gerrymandering, but it tends to need the help of someone getting caught with their pants down.. otherwise it just gets reinforced more and more. And thats why we get people who can say the most idiotic shit you have ever heard and not lose their next election. they have the right team flag on their sleeve.    yeah he does great videos explaining the problems, solutions and effects. most people dont think of the process, they just dont like the results. i bet most americans havent even considered the idea that their might be different ways of voting than first past the post.  and first past the post is kinda the default way voting starts and as such kinda feels like the way it should be, until you look at the flaws.    thats what he is saying.. but one caveat.  but I absolutely assure you, Congress has the power to change the constitution.  Not without  ratification from 3/4th the states(their congresses and gov).. so no the federal congress cant do it alone.    wow. it would never be ratified today.   well is it the old style rba without the big holes on the side?  people are drilling them out.    OReillys statement is particularly surprising coming from a senior FCC official, given that the FCCs mandate is, among other things, to "encourage the deployment on a reasonable and timely basis of advanced telecommunications capability to all Americans, according to the Telecommunications Act of 1996.  not really.  republicans put anti union people on the labor board.  they put young earthers and global warming denialist in charge of science.  and they made a man who said the un should be raised to the ground, as our lead diplomat to the institution.  its kinda their MO.    so much testosterone and yet so fabulous.    where is the demands for answers from the usual privacy advocates we have in gov? they seem strangely silent on this one.   idk that was the title.. i guess cause both flags are more than recognizable.    lol how does that work. Its a bot. it isnt partisan. it simply looked at op link and turns from a crappy mobile to one we can ready. It doesnt even know what the link is of. It could be praising israel. it could be praising you. All it does is take a mobile link and make the non mobile version which is helpful.  To vote it down is just retarded partisan politics. Its a thing.. it doesnt have an opinion.      for nothing but educational access it is ridiculous to not provide the net to the poor.   screw getting the jobs and everything else.. the right always scream that the poor who work 60-80 hours a week at min wage barely feeding their family, just need to better themselves. Its not always possible or afford for them to go to college, but just maybe some of them, instead of staying in a dead end job that needs welfare assistance, might learn programming and help the us economically.    pretty cool thanks.   One leaves on a spaceship at .99% of the speed of light and flies around for awhile.

I get they would protect the taxi drivers but.. well idk, even if you think the taxi drivers were right, cowtowing to them and attacking uber right after so many taxi drivers were seen dropping cinder blocks on random cars they thought were uber.. well that just kinda invites politics through rioting and violence.    wow how did you even intepret that that way.?  the coins had the graven image of caesar. the reason they were asking jesus about paying taxes, is they were trying to trick him. See they figured he would say it was wrong, due to religious law.   IT CONFLICTED WITH THE LAW OF GOD.  Jesus said, render unto ceaser, meaning the state cant make a sinner out of you, even though the graven image is a front to christianity.   and its not the only time they say that. They actually do say you should follow government because government was created by god.   romans 13  Let everyone be subject to the governing authorities, for there is no authority except that which God has established. The authorities that exist have been established by God. 2 Consequently, whoever rebels against the authority is rebelling against what God has instituted, and those who do so will bring judgment on themselves  its a bit clear. but he clears it up more. So what happens if they are an anti christian dick?  Do you want to be free from fear of the one in authority? Then do what is right and you will be commended.  you still follow the law, but you also lead by good example and god will help.  but incase it isnt entirely clear.. he goes on.. romans 14  This is also why you pay taxes, for the authorities are Gods servants, who give their full time to governing. 7 Give to everyone what you owe them: If you owe taxes, pay taxes; if revenue, then revenue; if respect, then respect; if honor, then honor.  if they tell you to respect and honor gay marriage you have to.    Spending bill would also require religious experts to review recommendations for reproductive technique.  sigh. And what exactly is a religious expert? can you be one when everyone seems to choose what to believe? i know this is /r/science, but these same people dont put any effort behind keeping people from working on sundays compared to what they did to fight gay marriage.. well i have to question anyone who calls themselves an 'expert'.  the verses dealing with gay sex, was something 'god' told someone, where the not working on sunday thing, he wrote in stone... which is actually where we get the phrase, "written in stone" as a sign of permanence.     WOT?!?  1. lets see that gallup poll. I am interested in seeing it. Not sure the point. Are states banning reality tv? or are you saying the private markets are giving us reality tv when no one wants to watch it?  2. again what is the point? OP's own link shows in 2010.. most people were AGAINST gay marriage. But the scotus ruling did not occur in 2010. it occured in 2015 when MOST PEOPLE ARE FOR IT. are you just claiming that peoples views change over time? Sure i agree, peoples views do change. Not sure what any of that has to do with OPs chart or even the idea the title is trying to convey. please clarify for me.    to be fair, your poll is a measurement of the US, they are talking about individual states, who often passed the bigoted anti gay shit by referendum.   edit; I aint going to claim they are talking about individual states,, cause well politics. I assume they are talking about individual states.   i do wonder, why the left doesnt do what the right would have done in this situation... "the supreme court once again slaps down".. obama.. "for his overreaching unamerican policies".. denying americans their god given rights. "this is a good day for america when the supreme court tells the left once again that what they are doing is wrong and illegal"  (yeah the parts out of quotes are just parts the GOP wouldnt say.. this comment is based on the bizzaro world where the GOP supports gay rights, but still respond to things in classic GOP fashion)   uganda.. though it might be a  bit dark for them there if you catch my drift.   I agree try the removal tool, though its probably best to do a clean install of windows, that will make it feel as new as possible and get rid of all the minor problems than can develop over time.  but why do you want to get rid of eset? I havent used them in a while but in my experience its a good AV with low overhead and low annoyance.   Asked directly whether no Palestinian state would be created under his leadership, the prime minister answered: Indeed"  you cant ignore what he said before the election and then expect us to take for golden the shit he said after the election after attacked by the entire planet for the shit he said before the election. You also seem to skip the part about overwhelming the arab vote.. i wonder why.. maybe cause net didnt clarify that bigoted crap huh?  [Netanyahu apologises for warning about Arabs voting in election](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/mar/23/netanyahu-apologises-arabs-israel-warning-voting-election)  we get it... you and net are doing the american southern strategy. YOU scream nigger nigger nigger, and when someone calls you on it you say you were misquoted and what you really wanted to talk about was bussing and charter schools. Same thing the right does. they try to scare right wingers that the minority vote is going to overwhelm theirs. same thing bigot net did.      Oslo was dead long before then.  so just ignore the mans actually words from his own lips.. and just claim he wants peace. GOT IT.   Sure, some people in Israel and Israel's government have no interest in diplomacy. So? I'm happy to say that, I'm perfectly comfortable with facts.  amazing you admit it.. thats a good first step.  Some Israeli settlers act like terrorists. The majority of them, and the majority of Israelis, do not support attacks on civilians.  this too.  This is false and unrelated  no it isnt, you are attacking me for things I never said. hense strawman.  how the fuck can it be unrelated when we are having this convo right now.. and you are purposefully misrepresenting what i said?   Do you mean 1948?  [nope. I meant 1967](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six-Day_War).. you do know the history of the area right? what the whole question about borders is? Most people today accept the 1948 ones.. its the 1967 ones that are the trouble,. Yeah i said 1968 over 1967 but it is more than remarkable you had no clue what i was talking about.    they do it everywhere.  there is actually fertilizer lawn paint. you paint your lawn green and the ferts help it become green ..with proper watering.. later. [here is some grass paint, not sure if this is the one with ferts](http://www.lawnlift.com/products.asp?cc=)  its done a lot in certain communities where...browning grass or even new lawns are kinda frowned upon.. people even do it to sod.. when its just a little to light green from transport. and also used for spot hiding.. like dog urine spots which can really burn brown in the hot dry seasons.   NO. Not at all.  not even close.  but they are getting tighter on restrictions.  Now who to believe.. me? or itonlygetsworse. hmmm.. if there was only some way to tell.

The rebates cover PART of the costs.. to encourage people to do it.  the main reasons people do it, is maintenance.. its easier and you dont have to worry about the various restrictions on water usage that come now and then. Who cares if you can remember if you can water your lawn on wed, or thurs? you dont have to water your lawn at all.  so whats the point about putting an old lawn back in? if you just want to spend money on a meaningless exercise... maybe but otherwise there isnt any reason to do this.(yeah you might not like the low water plants, but why put them in in the first place? the rebate only gets you some of your expenditures back)       did you see the post the other day on water?

It's what Abbas admitted he would do back in 2009:  [Israel's PM Netanyahu: No Palestinian state on my watch](http://www.cnn.com/2015/03/16/middleeast/israel-netanyahu-palestinian-state/) he alo demanded right winger israelis overwelm the arab vote, which is pure bigotry. he was using fear like you right wingers always do.  derp much dude? i never said hamas was all the open arms people.. of cause you are talking about the other wing of palistine in your links.. but w/e I SAID THEY WERENT THE SOLE CAUSE.. as you pretend they are.  [Netanyahu admits on video he deceived US to destroy Oslo accord](http://www.thenational.ae/news/world/middle-east/netanyahu-admits-on-video-he-deceived-us-to-destroy-oslo-accord)  lets do an experiment in bias and bigotry and we will see who is the full of shit one.  1. many in palistines leadership have zero interest in peace.  2. hamas military wing is a terrorist org that attacks innocent people  3. the palestinians and arabs helped start this when they went to war in 1968  Now let see you at least admit, that some people in israel and in their leadership have no interest in diplomacy.. you wont explode i promise.  admit that some israelis, especially the settlers act like terrorists.  can you admit any of that? nope. Sorry dude you are ignorant of the situation. I never denied palestine's shit stunk.. i denied that israelis shit smells like roses 100% of the time.  you are attacking strawmen.     well except there are catholics there already and yes this is about letting them build more churches and do more catholic things there.  and if it is so useless why the hell did the right get so fucking upset leading up to this, and so fucking upset when it happened?   i find it interesting the right are all screaming.. the pope needs to stay out of it.. this isnt his business.  and then when it happens and goes against yalls demands "it doesnt matter, it is all meaningless"    peace is impossible with an iraeli leadership that says they refuse to try to achieve peace.  you have no legs to stand on after nets election comments. You dont.  he didnt say "IF they renounce"  he said they would NEVER have a state.  #1 is just horseshit.. not only do they want palistine to agree to disputed borders israel claims before they will come to the table of diplomacy.. but they want israel.. the democracy, to be recognized as a permanent and solely jewish state. And well thats horseshit as well.  really, i think we should just take it away from both groups.. yeah you can live there but the entire area should become a world heritage site for abrahamic religions. And let them all come and live there. Jews, muslims christians. Dont mater and just let the UN run the place.. they created it anyways.     so we demand they vote.. they vote for the wrong people and we take our ball and scream we aint gonna play anymore.    I dont care if he quotes from a bubble gum wrapper as long as it is sourced.. which is better than the dude he is responding to.  you do see them blue underlined words in the blog. Click them. If they go to another blog, you have a point, if they go to legit media.. you dont.     The Middle East/African voting bloc routinely gangs up on them for political/religious/fuck America's client state reasons.  because you say so right?  much like the right says the media is all liberal and they unfairly attack republicans when they point out that NO womens bodies dont have an off switch in case of rape.  Israel is anything but perfect, but they're far and away the best country in the region concerning human rights.   when they arent runing over americans with bulldozers, kicking palestinians out of their own pools so settlers can use them instead of shooting at farmers harvesting their crops.. and denying gaza access to such dangerous items as biscuits and chocolates.  i dont deny that areas in the region dont have worse trouble.  But here is another rub.. you do realize what your comment is basically saying? its what cops hear all the fucking time.  "WHY THE FUCK ARE YOU BUSTING ME WHEN THERE ARE MURDERERS OUT THERE"  um cause you broke the law. saying their are worse people out their is no justification for breaking the law. It was the same thing the american right said about bush's torture program. "well in iran they do worse"   so what. It doesnt make it right.  saying theri are worse people doesnt give you the high ground.        The UN report was commissioned by the UNHRC, a body that has condemned Israel more than every other country in the world combined. That is not an unbiased investigation.  yep when ruled against, always claim bias.   I hear criminals who are arrested a lot.. they like to do that to. A dude down the street was arrested 4 times for meth. i havent been arrested once. I dont do meth. I guess the cops are biased against him. duh.   You may be interested in an extensive report [4] detailing how the UN relies on solely Palestinian amateur accounts, and fails to properly investigate.  LOL and israel controls entry into palistine for them to investigate.  LOL  **dude you still lose when you pretend everything is palistine when the leader of israel said they would not have a state on his watch. **  it doesnt matter how wrong palestine is.. doesnt matter how many rockets. or the un lies. Or the gaza attack. Your dude said he has no interest in diplomacy and you want to put all the blame on palestine.    "before coming to the negotiating table, we demand you give up key parts of the negotiation"  right wingers version of diplomancy.. its called I DONT FUCKING WANT TO DO IT SO I WILL PRETEND I DO.  it was the same with iran.. they demand iran end the nuclear program before we come to the table to discuss the nuclear program.  its solely designed to make it look like your willing to talk when you arent.  also recognizing israel.. they demand that innocuous thing all the time. why do they give a fuck? because it isnt innocuous. In order to recognize a state, you got to recognize the borders.. and they want palistine to give up claim to east jereselum before coming to the table.  **and taaravakin after the election, you really dont have a leg to stand on to claim high ground.**  The bigot fuck net, showed his bigot ass on tv. You cant scream that israelis much counter the israeli arab vote or scream that palestine will never be a state on his watch and then try to claim you are the reasonable one, and its all palestine who wont come to the table.  seriously dude, how the fuck do you think you could? ignoring the left right aspect.. seriously how the fuck do you think you can blame everything on hamas and palistine in the face of the comments of net during the last election? That just baffles me. i can understand bias and your feelings but to be willing to open your mouth in the face of a reality that plainly denies what you are saying, is quite interesting. Do you want to claim the sun is purple?   not really, just some biased person trying to dillute it.    The Vatican has agreed to a new treaty with Palestinian representatives that refers to them as the State of Palestine, which the Associated Press is reporting as formal recognition of Palestine as a state. A Vatican spokesman told AP, "Yes, it's a recognition that the state exists." The Vatican recognized Palestine as a state after a 2012 UN vote, but this is the first official agreement the Vatican has concluded that recognizes "the state of Palestine."   saying "hey we think you are a state" is all and great in 2012.. putting it down on paper is saying .. WE MEAN IT.   and [for something meaningless.. they were immediately attacked for it.] (http://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/vatican-recognizes-state-palestine-new-treaty-n358286)  i guess the left shouldnt cheer, but the rigth are allowed to attack.

Yes many in hamas dont want negotiations. they gained power and maintain power through conflict with the israels.. MUCH LIKE LIKUD,, who derives its power from the conflict with the palestinians.  I didnt downvote you.. but i would have upvoted you without that stupid line based on ignorance.     yea and that was the fears at the time.. But you know some line in the sand type folks.. said fuck you this is our flag.  though in hindsight it is fitting.    eh i am discussing both.. i would like to hear about the ignorance and bigotry that designed these other flags so i can judge if it is similar. But i remain skeptical without examples. I will never TIL from a sourceless comment.    No one is denying that.  but people being racist, doesnt all of a sudden equate that they designed their flags for racist reasons. Some of us need a bit more proof. and if you know european history.. then share.    give me one single flag that was created for racist reasons. I WANT TO LEARN.    ok educate me, I like flags but not really an aficionado and well this is the net, and people just saying things that are sorta vague.. well give me some examples man. not doubting you, not educated enough on the various flags to actually deny your claim. So cure my ignorance.  like one example i for the longest time was misinformed that the black in the jamaican flag represented black people, but if you look the original meaning was hardship. I was misinformed by someone who claimed to know. And rather than google every flag in europe and africa, if you could give me examples so i can verify you arent like my friend, and i can make a better decision on why they made their flags the way they did.  I mean if you do find a flag where the white represented "the people" in a mostly homogenous nation of white people, i dont think that really counts in the same way. They didnt make the flag for whites.. its just their nation didnt have black people in it when the flag was made.    i dont see it.  We will put massive pressure on them. and do you think the nsa doesnt have a dossier on her? private info they could use to pressure? i am slightly hopeful cause france told us to fuck off over iraq but that was quite some time ago and the beast has only grown since then/.    Horseshit. I dont know if you were educated in the south, or just falling for some spun ass nonsense.  Yes it came back in the civil rights era.. but even back in the civil war it was pure racism.  here  [Heres the Racist Meaning Of the Confederate Flag, In the Words of the Man Who Designed It](http://mic.com/articles/121082/here-s-the-racist-meaning-of-the-confederate-flag-in-the-words-of-the-man-who-designed-it)  transcribed from the picture.  it would soon rank among the proudest ensigns of the nations and be hailed by the civilized world as THE WHITE MAN'S FLAG.  IT was always bigoted.  it also represented the confederacy.. which we will ignore was the enemy. The confederacy constitution in the preamble said it was all about slavery.. and that white people have the inalienable right to own blacks.   and you can read quotes from the [confederate leaders at the start of the war](http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2015/06/what-this-cruel-war-was-over/396482/)  your falling for the same horseshit, this bigoed asshol is spewing. Sorry but its a total aberration of history to claim this flag had anything at all to do with anything but bigotry. **From the flag creator, to the constitution ot their leaders, they all admit it it was all about bigotry. not sure why so many cant today.**     semantics.    While i wish he would. Seems like a good idea and all, you cant pick a good guy and then just complain hes not doing enough. because you can always find more things he could do.  should he invest in these companies, maybe not, but not going to become a gates hater over it. And his investing doesnt really change anything, its demand and governments are the only thing that can.. its not like the oil companies will go out of business cause gates sold their stock. Really everyone could, and it might hurt some ceos a little, but mostly all it would do is decrease the price/earnings ratio.. make the stock look more attractive.     [unchecky is a godsend.. ](http://unchecky.com/)   this is unfathomable.   Bristol Palin later became a paid spokeswoman advocating abstinence   well..

She could otherwise be a fine, nice young lady.   idk, in election season when we still have the same types out their promoting this crap, its still a good example for why its a bad idea. It really wouldnt matter that it was the palins.. or the obamas to be honest.. republican, dem i dont care. Not the point. She and her family promoted abstinence. She also LEAD a teen pregnancy prevention non profit.  Just like anti gay guys turning out to be gay... I'm not so sure I agree with you on the burying, as fox wouldnt bury it if it wasnt a republican. People like to read about that kind of stark hypocrisy and most of the time the media gives it to us.    why not post at /r/legaladvice  there probably is some tax advice subreddit.. idk  but heres what i know.  the $600 requirement isnt directed at you the payee. The $600 requirement is directed at them, the payor.  IF they pay any individual over $600 they are required to send you and the irs a 1099.  That is a requirement directed at the people who pay you. But it is to help them catch a lot of people that have been going under the radar.. people who get paid small chump change.  now here is the part your not going to like. Thats just the reporting requirements of the people who pay you. YOU are supposed to file taxes anyways. Even on just that $300. No really, your supposed to list it as income.  but like paying sales tax for catalogues, almost no one actually files the taxes unless they get a 1099 or earn over $600 from one company. and almost no one gets in trouble. The thing is they dont file a 1099 on you until you get over 600.. so... the irs doesnt really know you made 300. Could you get in trouble, sure, and your mom could get in trouble for not paying sales tax on all her catalogue purchases like no one has ever done ever but are supposed to do. But most likely you wont.(if you did it a fuck ton, maybe.. like split it up in 500 dollar chunks between 100 companies.. well it might become noticeable) and really the irs is too broke to go after little fish rn. the right punished them for the irsgate nonsense and cut their budget a lot and obamacare added a fuck ton more work for them. so they kinda up to theri necks right now.  not a lawyer, or an accountant, or work for the irs, take this for what you will, but I attest it is mostly true. :)    enhanced interrogation sounds much nicer.   I kinda think he was being humorous, kinda saying they are just taking the long trip to designing a desktop pc.  but yeah i do think people wouldnt mind a station they could plug in the laptop at home for more gaming..    The proposed bill is aimed at cracking down on the visual blight that occurs when vehicle owners store cars that dont work on their property.  how about address the problem? Just make sure they dont let cars fall apart on the streets. There should be zero reason you cant put a non working car under a car cover, or maintain it by washing a non working car or even a working car, while you get on your feet until you can afford insurance and legally drive. the problem isnt a lack of plates. the problem is letting cars get covered in crud and look like shit.   when they do this, i question the motive, because it would be easy to target the actual problem rather than throw out a broad net and make everyone park face forward in theri drive ways and have plates seen from the streets to make sure theri car isnt visual blight? how the fuck does a plate not make it a visual blight? can i put a plate on a car and let it sit there with flat tires, covered in crude and concert fliers? thats what they are saying? they cant tell the visual blight cars without a plate..er what? if you cant tell you cant argue its a visual blight.     there is no obamacare.. there is exchanges for the market place to compete for people on the individual market all in one place.. and some subsidies and crap. This is republicans counting on their base not knowing wtf Obamacare is.  they are trying to say it is so distasteful to get insurance this way that teh supreme court justices would refuse or something. Yeah it would end up costing them more than the free insurance they are provided.. but its just fucking insurance. There is no special obama to it. Its the same insurance you get at work.. just at work its cheaper because it is bought in bulk. this is a way to bring the costs down on the individual market.   anyways its a bit hilarious petty to try to punish scotus for a ruling they didnt like. Can you imagine if Obama tried to punish scotus  for ruling against his recess appointments or his abortion center buffer zone? I think he would already be under impeachment.    [not real](http://m.snopes.com/texas-woman-pregnant-by-pig/)   and come on who would report it to the media? her hyper religious parents?   well except it IS working.   no 20% healthcare costs isnt a positive, but it is in a positive direction compared to the 35% we were starting to see.  i swear some people do all they can to not admit things like that. we are mostly all in agreement on single payer. Most of us think obamacare isnt that great.. but its better than what we had.     the jobless young people will get subsidies or medicare.. the ones with jobs will have to pay.    and now your just being a dick. the concept that everyone should have perfect prose, when not everyone is english or grammatically oriented and considering the various idiocies of the language is a bit extreme. So I must assume you are just being a prick. Good on you. you right short worthless comments that are perfectly punctuated.  I wonder how you are at calculous.  this place is casual in nature and the comments are disposable. No one is going to read this tomorrow. And just like when i make mock devices of something i want to build. I dont make it perfect. I make it good enough to work. I find people like you just want to hijack the convo and make it about grammar rather than discussing the content of the comment someone made. Its a bit low effort.    I have a feeling you happen to be a libertarian/right winger version of an atheist? Most people didnt seem to actually have that much trouble understanding the concepts, that i was trying to convey.  While admittedly it isnt the cleanest prose, it is hardly as incoherent as your post. I suspect, your disagreement has more to do with politics than punctuation.    i did miss use some punctuation, but I'm not trying to be published, just talking with like minded friends. I'd definitely clean my work up for commercial or educational purposes, but i tend to not proof read or care as much when its idle conversation. Not that its a valid excuse to write so poorly, but it is what it is.    true but you got to give it to her for keeping her eye on the ball. she had a razor focus, and yeah in slow mo, but as a crappy golfer myself, i'm easily distracted by anything but the ball.    they could afford to do both, often it has to do more with regulatory ideas.. and google wants to be able to reach everyone.. while fiber is great, there is a reason why they want free wifi...and NYC is a bit of a hotbed of tourism.. tourist walking around town.. needing info...on where to go. Google is mainly an advertising company. Tourists are some of the best cut of the consumer meat.    she wasnt wrong.. you people dont get it.  When conservatives fail and become pregnant it is called being human.. and has nothing to do with the abstinence.  when liberals do, its due to their crappy ideology that encourages teens to get pregnant as soon and as often as possible with as many species as possible.  (and yeah this is about religion, but its the right winger version that tries to force the ideas on others, where the left winger version might believe that it is wrong but believe in leading by example over leading by legislation)  **edit:** and to forgive the right a little in this concept, people in general tend to do this-- just this current subject is more conservative.But we tend to judge ourselves by our intentions,while we judge others by their actions. When i cut you off, its an accident, i was a little off today.. sorry. When you cut me off its cause your a fucking idiot who doesnt know how to fucking drive and prolly got his dl in a box of cracker jacks anyways.(eh atheism isnt the politics of left versus right and wanted to pull back a little)    Both... well now looks like just one.  Warm waters tend to bleach corals, while acidification makes it harder to get the carbon to make theri structures.  This article however is stating that some species will do ok, and so it will adjust, but some will die out. and its mainly investigating why some corals can rapidly adapt to temps while other species cant.  unlike the title, the study isnt saying that.. it says they can and are and will be adapting to a warmer ocean. Not to global warming itself, since that includes not only warming but the acidification.(which i believe would also happen with natural warming but much latter due to co2 feedback from warmth.. whereas with  AGW we put the co2 into the air already)  Now i guess someone might say.. well wait, if they say some corals evolved from warmer times and other corals that evolved from those corals have an easier time evolving with the heat than those who didnt have such a past. Shouldnt they have the same with acid.. since i say it will get acidic anyways. And while i am not in this field.. I would have to say no this doesnt prove that. While it might prove the corals have mechanism for quickly dealing with quickly rising temps, it doesnt show it has the mechanism to survive with quickly rising acidity even if its ancestors survived in a more acidic environment..    well its more than 'cant stand the heat'  and most of the argument is actually that its better AND CHEAPER to mitigate some of the problems now, than wait until later when its much more expensive and harder to do.  almost no one says humans will die out.  and had we started sooner, like in the 2000s with the plans on the tables back then, we would have been able to mitigate the effects even more.. the longer we wait, the more we will have to "just deal with"    ok on the first sentence, bah on the second.  thats just click bait bs.  had 911 been successful the deaths would have been much higher.. but one plane crashed in a field and another the terrorists never made it on.  and judging how many would die on success is a bit of an art than science.  you can make some guesses, but they are only really educated guesses.    kinda unfortunately reddit doesnt allow editing titles even to self posts. I get some of the dangers but you could easily implement some tracking of changes like wiki where people can click and see past titles and such and make up their own minds if shenanigans is going on or if the changes were legit.  there have been a couple posts of mine, that made it to teh front of reddit, where comment information changed what the title should say.. and my title was suddenly misleading IMO and i couldnt do anything about it.. and since so many people dont click through or read the comments, .. i was doing damage that i couldnt stop.  i am glad these days they have at least let mods add a little flair to titles so they can say "debunked".. or "mirror in comments".."not real, viral ad" but they really should let us to fix titles... hey send a message to everyone who voted that the title was changed to let them change theri vote.. fine, but they should let us fix titles.     yeah, having messed with markup over the years, while this might not be aesthetically pleasing compared to some more graphic articles. Its extremely pleasing in the medium it was done in.   yeah  good point but i bet it is still pretty similar. your just going to know more about those industries if you live there.  Your going to have relatives and friends in them. And your more likely to hear info, that you might not hear from other sources. And the local consumable media tends to be biased towards the local industries. yoru going to get a more positive view.   my grands house still has the old ones inside.. for a few storage areas. I developed a thing for big ass old keys for a short time as a kid.    YOu still cant seem to grasp the point.  tell me is theri a difference between what a klan uniform is designed for, and what a bed sheet is designed for? think anyone was raped on a bed sheet? well bigotry and rape are both wrong but ONE IS DESIGNED FOR THE PURPOSE OF BIGOTRY.. the other wasnt designed for rape.. it was just used that way.  same with your examples. You fail because the conservative flag was designed for bigotry.. read their constitution as well as the words of the dude who created it who put it on an all white background because it was the white mans flag.  and it was put up all over the south SPECIFICALLY for bigotry reasons to protest desegregation.  YES THE AMERICAN FLAG HAS BEEN ABUSED.. just like a rape happening on a bed sheet. But the american flag wasnt designed to promote abuse, nation building or anything else.   THE CONFEDERATE FLAG WAS DESIGNED TO PROMOTE BIGOTRY.  not sure why yall dont get the different between use and abuse.   maybe i should try the right winger verision.  And electric chair purpose is to kill people.  thats not always true with guns., especially things like shot guns which were explicitly designed for hunting. But people do kill people with shot guns. That is abusing the guns purpose.  The chair on the other hand HAS THE SOLE PURPOSE of killing people.  its the same difference between the american flag, which was designed to be the flag of this nation, versus the confederate flag which was designed to be the flag of the white man.. in the designers own words.    yeah and he wrote about how much the golds gym ideology helped promote his madness.  derp much dude?    MOTHER FUCKER.  the civil war was fought over slavery.. its in theri constitution  Motehr fucker.. the flag was put up only to protest civil rights by threatening a new civil war.. it wasnt put up to celebrate any heritage or history.  the american flag... while it has been abused all over.. wasnt designed to be bigoted. And the pyramids while built by egyptions werent designed solely to spit in the face of the jews.  the confederate flag was. Thats why yall put it up during civil rights, and not at some special civil war holiday.  besides its the fucking enemy of the us.  you do realize many fucking germans have nazis as relatives? you dont think it would be condemened by the planet for parts of germany to start to display that flag all over their governments for "heritage" reasons  DONT BE A JACKASS MOTHERFUCKER.  we can debate the issue without either side being jackassses MOTHERFUCKER.      yeah i actually think its a bit retarded what apple did.  but the flag was addopted by the klan to attack blacks with.  it was never historically part of SC besides for the klan.  until the civil rights era when right wingers threatened a new civil war.. and raised the northern virgina regiments flag all over the south.  most people dont have a problem with the flag.. the problem is when the governments promote it. and even if you scream heritage which is pretty ignorant since it wasnt put up to celebrate teh civil war but to fight civil rights, its the flag of the enemy of the US. and right wingers got upset and legit so, when a small spanish town had the mexican flag flying over the post office. This is america. but see historically that small spanish town.. USED TO BE MEXICO.. they have heritage as well. Doesnt matter This is america. They can fly the flag at their homes but leave the government out of it.  right wingers seem to grasp that in all things until the government promotes theri ideas and then they all play dumb.   well just like the mexican flag doesnt belong flying over any gov building in mexico the losing confederate flag has zero business flying over gov buildings in the US. The gov should be as generic as it comes when it comes to promoting of ideas.   you dont need a fucking christmas display at the state house.. what fucking purpose does that serve besides telling non christians that this is a christian biased state?  we shouldnt have speciality plates for your car.. people cant afford a fucking bumper sticker?   shit from the gov should be cold generic and limited to the state flag and the us flag.  you can celebrate heritage and ideas at home.   so making less than min wage, is hard to keep up motivation.. who knew.(yeah i know many of us just use it as a way to get money you dont feel bad about blowing and have other income.. still point stands.. below min wage as far as the buying power it affords is not very motivating once you have already eaten)  and to ramble on, it doesnt even have to be about money.. you can see it some in games and things. scbuildit is an ok game on the android. They have these things called expansion items which let you expand your territory, they are semi rare in finding. but after so many clicks on average you will get one. well they just updated the game, adding a different expansion area and 3 more expansion parts.. the gist of it all is that it now takes more clicks to expand the game than it did before... basically they cut my imaginary game salary i got for the labor i did in click bubbles. and well i am not motivated to play anymore.     yeah everyone goes through it.    yeah annoying af   you are actually going to link teh american shitter to help this dude understand? fuck might as well linked what teh council of conservative citizens thinks on it.(for teh canadian the american shitter simply exists to attack the left in all things, doesnt matter what it is, a right winger could shoot another right winger in the face and it would be the lefts fault.. they complain fox was attacked when fox tried to claim it wasnt about race.. it ws about christians and was due to obama and affirmative action.. they deserved attack.)  could you get a more partisan hyper right winger source?  teh flag wasnt in use in most of the south.. it was the battle flag of the northern virginia regiment of the confederacy. IT WAS HOWEVER adopted by hyper bigot groups like the klan.. and until teh civil rights era, thats pretty much the only people who used it.     but really dont read that american shitter article.. you will just get more misinformed..AND YEAH I WOULD SAY THE SAME IF IT WAS AN ARTICLE FROM THE BLACK PANTHERS.  you simply wont get any sort of a view of reality from people as partisan as the american shitter or the black panthers.   edit: ok i guess your trying to show how the right are being.. it wasnt totally clear by your link title.  teh [confederate flag is basically an extension of the rights bigoted southern strategy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_strategy) designed specifically to foster distrust betweeen the the races in order to attract the bigot vote, who fled the dem party when the dems adopted civil rights. and its the main reason for the wink wink nudge nudge.. no it isnt about racism    but there are still problems with that concept.   for a more cogent example than the ones we have used. Some of the more people based and vague laws.. like indecency. If you look back at how a person in the 1700 might interpret indecency laws... well women today still wouldnt be allowed show above their ankles   so that means no free speech on computers because no one in the 1700s would have interpret it to include these type devices. ...  ok some might take exception with my example but the problem with his view is that society progresses. People in teh 1700 might not think free speech applies to hustler but then again they didnt have a concept of magazine and porn of that nature.  thats not to say certain laws dont actually NEED to be fixed to adjust with the times, but some we just shouldnt have to.. just because the medium changes.  you can say i am reading too much into how he does things but there are concepts that it just doesnt seem to make sense to say 'how would someone from 300 years ago interpret this'   they actually used to look like that.. which is why the graphic stuck around... sorta like the save button in word programs often looks like a diskette.   and [phones dont look like this](http://4vector.com/i/free-vector-phone-clip-art_110132_Phone_clip_art_hight.png)  but of course a plain white square on a black background might not say phone to people these days so prolly best we kept the old model graphic. :)    its pretty cool.. but i wonder why this hasnt been done sooner.   People doing bitcoin have been making theri cards external for a long time now with risers. i get it isnt quite the same but it also isnt quite that far away from it all.    from the link click through in the article just cause i liked it.  In the mid-1980s, after consulting with Drucker, furniture maker Herman Miller (MLHR) agreed that its CEO's pay would be restricted to 20 times the average of all its employees. "The subtle part of this limit was the message to the CEO: If you want to get more pay, you need to do it by raising the average pay" of everyone at the company.  thats teem work. everyone from the janitor to the ceo working on the same goals. And i bet all feel valued like part of a company rather than a worthless product to be dropped on a whim.   they should fight for basic income over fighting for jobs.   one of the problems that society is facing and will get worse, is the jobs are going to disappear. Its the evolutionary direction of technology.. its kinda the point. We invent things to do the things we dont like to do for us. To free up time to do other things.  We dont have to wash our own clothes by hand which takes forever and is hard and sucks.. we throw it in a big white box, push a button and go do something else.  The luddites were before their time for sure, when technology came for the unskilled jobs, besides new unskilled jobs were created, people could better themselves as some like to cry. But there was a growth in need for skilled labor. Well now they are coming for the skilled jobs, and theres not going to be anywhere for humans to better ourselves into.. there is skilled or unskilled.. there isnt another rung.  at that point the only people with wealth, are those that own the means of production and all the robots.  there will probably be reforms we dont like that are needed as we implement BI.. but eventually there wont be a lot of choice, unless we just want to watch a lot of society die off.and yeah thats a bit off.. but it is the eventual course technology takes us.(and sorry but soon enough computers will even be better programmers than us, so saying everyone will just have jobs making the robots, well robots will take those jobs too eventually)  and yeah, i'm just an insane redditor.. lots of people make excuses and babble about shit that just has no bearing on reality. but luckily i aint the only one that says this.  [Bill Gates thinks super machines could eventually become smarter than humans and take our jobs](http://www.businessinsider.com/bill-gates-artificial-intelligence-2015-3) (who wouldnt be the type of person to make up luddite conspiracy stories cause they are stuck in a dead end min wage job)   well after arguing with one of them anti gov types on why the government NEEDs to do min wage(under current system).. who uses similar verbiage.... I have to say i do agree with you, and him, but only if their was a BI already.   I very much disagree without it, as you can see the effects of not having one in our history and in other countries right now, as our corps like walmart try to go back to paying people in corporate script or walmart bucks that could only be spent at the company store .. in mexico. Its the same games of desperation the robber barons did in the past. The reason the magic doesnt work, is people NEED TO EAT... its sign the contract or starve.. you can say there are others.. but the point is eventually YOU HAVE to sign one.. or starve or turn to crime. With a BI this opens the freedom for the magic of the markets to actually be realized. being able to eat people can sign the contracts based on the value of their labor hours and not the value of not starving to death.(which you can imagine.. is quite low.. I mean if someone was literally starving in front of you, you could probably get a fuck ton of labor for a sandwich)   **tl;dr** the contractional freedoms thing doesnt work without BI, cause the guy hiring can wait longer for an employee than the hirees can wait for food.    not really.  i mean there are arguments against gravity too but the thing is their are things called experiments and we got 50 states of them, many had min wages before the fed government. They didnt add them for no fucking reason. They added them because we already tried it your way.  you can also see it being abused by american companies in mexico where they pay peopl ethey way you folks want.. in walmart script.. where the employees couldnt spend their pay anywhere but the company store.  you can see the problems in china to where people have to deal with the conditions we fought to get out of. Working fo 25 cents an hour, locked in a factory with no ac and many work place accidents.  this shit didnt come because some leftie had a wet dream  it came because people were suffering from trying its yalls way  the world wasnt invented with min wage  we tried it your way for years  I dont know why yall dont understand that  we tried your way  IT FAILED  bad  PS states with a higher "price floor" did better than those who didnt.  thats calls a failure of hypothesis.  [States That Raised Minimum Wage See Faster Job Growth, Report Says](http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2014/07/19/332879409/states-that-raised-minimum-wage-see-faster-job-growth-report-says)    well this is a horse shit view. you same people say some of the problems with college is not everyone can go.  like it or not people do work for life with families at min wage, despite you right wingers pretending this isnt true.   and for less than they did in 1968 despite american is twice as rich per capita and adjusted for inflation.. people like you demand they work for less than they did in 1968.  and yeah we get why right wingers spread these bullshit memes. Its because most people who do work min wage for life, raising familys working 80 hours a week as people like you call them lazy and tell them they need to go back to school and better themselves while working 80 hours a week and raising a family and cry if they ask for help. Sorry dude the reality is people do and have always worked for min wage as a living. and saying "just better yourself" is some ignorant fox news watching mother fucking shit on the state of america today.  	199
 Even more annoying was that Harbs and Roman claimed they watered the down the playbook and simplified it this offseason   I've driven in many different countries as well as states, and by far the worst drivers (mainly taxi) are here in NY.  My theory is that the majority of this city goes by public transportation, and having access to a car is much harder.  Therefore, not experienced.    I've also heard native NY'ers claim they wanted a service/driving job in the city (police, etc) b.c they wanted to drive a car.     There's also this other guy, he's called Jim Harbaugh, aka as the Head Coach.  But of course, he's never to blame right?  He only sits in every meeting for game planning, has the final call as to what the play calling should be etc.  Yeah Roman and Kaep are the biggest reasons.     Posted this in a similar thread:   If you look at the past 3 seasons, it's been a different team in stark contrasts.  Year 1, Harbaugh and Roman simplify the playbook and cater to Alex strengths. Remember the genius naked QB bootleg against the Saints in the playoffs? Where has that gone? The offense that year was pretty dismal at times, but we played really disciplined. There were a lot of shits, 2 TE sets, etc. Low scoring affairs, but the D was monster that year.  Year 2, we unleash Colin and the read option. Now the O is passing down the field more often, letting Colin run wild. In all the midst of it, the play calling changed and started to see more delay of games, weird run calls, etc. Let's not forget the last play of the Super Bowl.  Year 3. In the off season, both Harbs and Roman both agreed to clean and simplify the calls and terminology. What happened to our 2TE sets, or jumbo package for ground and pound?  How come Kap still throws 90+ mph fastballs to his receivers only a few feet away?  All these what and why ?s   It kills me when he throws a bullet to a WR 4 yards away.     Nah ignorance will supersede that   The way the offense has looked, we're not deserving of a SuperBowl.  This may sound weird, but I'd rather not make playoffs, so that in the offseason we clean up the roster and revise the playbook.    If this were to happen, there needs to be strict guidelines.  For instance, if the the officer tried to take off or disconnect the camera deliberately, their ass is fired.    If I were a honest cop, why wouldn't you want a body camera?   Reggie Miller made a living out kicking his leg out.  Lin's fadeway wasn't even close to the same kick leg as Reggies   Is there a specific # of years thats determined for all this?  Curious bc of similar incidents such as Penn State Jerry Sandusky, or the sexual abuse from the Catholic Churches.  Those events happened many years ago but the perpetrators were still prosecuted    It's incredible how many ally oops we've had this season compare to last   Can't tell, but did you keep the head on?     I got to watch S Dot a lot last year living in NY.  The thing I loved the most is the height advantage he has over most PG's.  His ability to post up and defend smaller guards really creates mismatches.  Give him a few more weeks and you will see exactly why Dubs picked him up.     Which last time I checked, dancing naked was illegal and people have been arrested for it.  Why this guy want charged is straight up baffling   I'm sorry, am I the only one that finds it wrong he wasn't charged?  Just bc you lose your shit doesn't mean you can parade in public naked making a scene.     Just wondering, but can the same be applied to the bicyclist that hit and killed the woman in Central Park?     If you look at the past 3 seasons, it's been a different team in stark contrasts.  Year 1, Harbaugh and Roman simplify the playbook and cater to Alex strengths.  Remember the genius naked QB bootleg against the Saints in the playoffs?  Where has that gone?  The offense that year was pretty dismal at times, but we played really disciplined.  There were a lot of shits, 2 TE sets, etc.  Low scoring affairs, but the D was monster that year.  Year 2, we unleash Colin and the read option.  Now the O is passing down the field more often, letting Colin run wild.

In the off season, both Harbs and Roman both agreed to clean and simplify the calls and terminology.  Although we're getting better at delay of games, it's night and day when you compare how the offense has looked.  I've never seen a team change identity so quickly.  To answer your question, yes I believe Roman is the problem.     And the person prior to that copied as well.  These are moves that have been around forever.  MJ crafted his own style from it.     Down to tail gate and pre party!  I'll be taking the train in with a buddy of mine.     Lynch is still learning schemes is primarily used on pass rushing downs.  Once Aldon comes back it'll be interesting to see what packages they will be using   When Livingston is running the 2nd unit, he'll be expected to distribute and be a pass first PG.     It's more like a 3 year window.  Look at OKC a few years back and that should tell you how quickly things change in the league.     UCC Coffee!!      On a similar note, Chinese food in Japan is pretty awesome.  Dishes like mabo tofu and tan tan men are good examples of that    Almost every time these "foods around the world, breakfast from every country" album pops up, they're entirely inaccurate.  Plus, I've never seen okonomiyaki look like the one posted in the pic.     Doubt it these days.  Last year, there were a few threads that really bashed Fitz.     This guy must destroy people in Jenga   curious what neighborhood did this took place in?   Contact Make A Wish Foundation.  See how they can assist   Asian guy here, but it's not too weird imo.  I got my "office" voice, and then my "kick it with the boys" voice.  2 completely different voices, 1 being.     His TD pass to Boldin against St.Louis was very Brett Farve like   How's the toe AJ?     He most certainly has looked more comfortable in the pocket.  His TD throw to Boldin was very Bret Farve like   Or go animal fries   But he also can wear out the other "4" because of his quickness.  I'm surprised they never tried a Steph, Klay, AI, Barnes, Bogut lineup   Kaep looked a little like Bret Farve on that TD throw to Boldin   Bogut didn't play in FIBA this year. I do think it raised Klay's confidence a little, but he's been working on his game all summer regardless of FIBA   Yup, certain sec at the Stick were regulated hardcore.  They knew the usher's name and would yell at the front row fans to always sit down.     NYC   I don't think its cocky.  It's his shot selection which I'm surprised more people don't mention about.  There's times he"ll pull up a fadeaway 3 with 2 defenders in his face.      And, no team had signed him so he's extra salty   Its bc a lot of these "fans" feel as though Harbaugh did the wrong thing by benching Alex Smith in favor of Kap.  Lotta salt from that wound   Must be a slow news day for Monte pool   There's times the 49ers resemble a college team based on their formations and shifting.  It's really predictable at times   007-373-5963   Other than Justin Smith's sack, the pass rush wasn't that impressive.  Similar to the Dallas game, it seemed as though we barely got to the QB.  Is this all because we're missing Aldon, or something else?       Why were soo pass happy?  Not just that, but the receivers were running long routes, 15+ patterns?     Anyone ever mistake you for [ronlivingston?](http://filmnewreleases.blogspot.com/2011/04/ron-livingston-in-game-change.html)      This wasn't my personal recollection, but I remember someone telling a story about this on  this subreddit.    Soon after the first tower was hit, people living in BK began walking on the BK bridge to get home.  There were hundreds of people all in a frenzy.  In the midst of all the chaos stood a huge motorycyle cop, shirt burned and halfway torn off.  He had swastikas and other crazy tats all over his body.    But what struck me was the tears streaming down his face as he was  guiding traffic.       That's the black stallion   The owners need to band together and make a statement.  That might get the ball rolling, but it's hard to imagine Goodell stepping down from all this.  NFL is in major damage control right now, and will try everything in it's power to make themselves look competent   Boomer is borderline awkward when he tries to force his hand on topics.  His morning show is even worse   With the NFL having to play damage control, I can't help but think Goodell will try and bring down the hammer regardless of the verdict pertaining to Ray McDonald.  It's the leagues way of compensating for the screw up.  Thought's, Concern's, Gripes?  Fire away   His book, "West by West" was a fun read.  Gives insight about his competitiveness and how he handled it.     And that's part of my issue with all this.  In my opinion, it's borderline disrespectful.  How so?  You got Kap busting his tail everyday, trying to do all he can in his power to carry the team to the Super Bowl.    And then you have a post about how happy some fans are that Alex Smith got a contract extension.  With the season starting in less than 4 hours, all focus should be on this team now, and how we're going to try and win another trophy.  Not a discussion on a QB that's no longer on a team that put up mediocre #'s.     Well if people stop posting of players not currently on the roster, then we can move on.  Of course there's a divide, and some fans still insist Alex was such a great player.  However all these Alex posts contribute nothing but debates and a big circle jerk.     Plus fuck ESPN   Anthony Randolph had all the makings of a super star.  Silly me when GS drafted him.  I think I even told one of buddies he's like KG but with handles and a jump shot   Impressed that the MMA kid fought while wearing his jacket   What are people's thoughts on lobster rolls that exclusively use claw meat only? I notice some places use various assortments, claw, tail, knuckly.  Tail meat IMO is the best.  I notice some Red Hook is claw and knuckle only   Thanks pal   This trumps Fette Sau?     Do you happen to know where your friend picked up that yakitori grill?     It was tasty, and if you've ever had Japanese Italian, the flavors were pretty spot on.  The cheese went really well with the noodles, and the sauce wasn't too tart either.  It wasn't heavy either         Or coming back from behind in Atlanta.     Exactly the right term, dink and dunk.  He can't complete a 20 yard out pattern to his WRs.  Either he gets too spooked in the pocket and does a check down, or doesnt have faith in his arm   This stuff goes well with grilled chicken   The post season really showed just how ineffective Lee was at times.  Granted bogut was out, but Lee looked absolutely spooked.    Each round in the playoffs gets more intense, and there's just no way lee could handle the likes of Duncan, Ibaka, etc.     I like marinating in sesame oil, scallion, Lotta salt, garlic and soy sauce.

Friends and I were smoking a blunt outside looking up a the sky.  All of a sudden we saw  2 F-14 fighter jets hovering over the SF bay.    You could barely see their outline, but could tell by the sound and the lights surrounding the plane.  It was unreal thinking no other planes were allowed in the sky other than them.     Ever try soaking corn in water for about 30 min to a hour?  Highly recommend   When Scarlett Johansson nude shots were leaked, never seen so many redditors be kind to each other    Klay needs to take a good hard look at what's around him and then decide what he needs to do.  He keeps saying he would like to play for GS, he's gonna need to take a discount in order to keep other players.  If money is the deciding factor, then he's better off somewhere else.  I.E. Ducan and Novitzki taking pay cuts in order to keep the team together      Funny how people balk on the idea of B Davis, but would consider signing Basemore in a heart beat.  A washed up Baron is still way more valuable than a back up cheerleader         Because he's anti-49er, and as a commentator he should be neutral.  His voice is also monotone   The guy sleeping might have slept horizontally on the subway seat which is a automatic fine in NYC subways.  It's a shit rule, but I've seen many people get tagged because of this.  This is the only thing I could think of as to why NYPD would harass him   No thanks, we need all bench room possible.  I would rather take the time to develop Nedo and another back up PG/SG than use it on Base.     The ones in Japan are insane. Induction heating, ceramic bowls are just a few of the perks.  Im too embarrassed to say how much we dropped on ours   Golden state please step up to the mic   Curry, Klay, Iguodola, Lebron, Bogut would be filthy.

"Oh Lebron is a wuss, I'm disappointed"   Ugh...didn't V.D learn the first time, it's all about the team?     More than just a extension.  It's a statement to the rest of the league.  Were betting the house this year or next year   Damn her Twitter is just as [bad](https://twitter.com/JanelleAmbrosia)   My own take on this, and from what I observed living in not so great areas, i.e West Oakland and Riverside County.  When it gets hot, people like to drink more, that's a given.    I noticed the liquor stores got busier, and the prices of 40 oz's dropped a little.  It's a cycle that doesn't stop.  People get drunk, sometimes get more irritable bc of the heat, drink more because their irritable, etc.    Then you mix that with violence, and with school being out kids being bored, and it's a perfect recipe for crime.  I have no stats on this, just personal observation, but it's a theme that occurs every summer.  And chances are, the hotter it gets, more violence.     Looks awesome.  For tender asparagus, try peeling the bottom half of the stems.  Theres so much fiber around there it gets tough and chewy    NY'er here.

Ended up being a huge marketing campaign for his start up   Tupac did Machiavelli.  Name another artist that could even come close to what he did.  How much more complex do you want from a artist? Btw, People Under the Stairs has cool flows, but complex would be a reach.     You're reaching with these points.  These guys are pros, and if you think a TV commentator is a distraction during practice, then they shouldn't be playing during crunch time in a playoff game   Perfect, just what Reddit needs. More idiotic and ignorant posts   where on this post was it noted that I didn't credit the F.O?  With all these moves being made, and the F.O trying to win a championship, if these moves end up being disastrous, who gets the blame?  That was the message of this post   You can claim we had the best starting line up, which is arguable.  I don't think we do, nor do we have a championship roster at this moment.    As for "Cry Monta" Is that supposed to mean something?     With GS being in the news spotlight and all, we are now under more scrutiny than ever before.  One thing I'm curious about is the "blame game"  that might happen if we don't win, or exceed expectations.    For instance, we had a bad bench and blame can be put on Myers and company for providing Mjax with such a shitty 2nd group.  I will give Myers some credit for the trade of Steve Blake.  However, we went into the season with Toney Douglas as the back up PG.  Did he really think that was going to work?    So the question is, at what point is it more a personnel issue (meaning players and how they're utilized) and a coach issue?  I'm expecting us to make major roster moves this summer, and if the trade doesn't work in our favor, who gets the blame?  I guess my point is, how many freebies does Myers and West get?  Is Lacob so blinded and so awe struck by his F.O that he won't hold them accountable?     Don't forget the 5 man substitution patterns   As credible as Yahoo's Woj is, this one seems far fetched.  Why would Warriors personnel reveal something like that to media?  It would work against their favor, and we've typically been very quiet to reporters  Edit- Nevermind, SVG wanted full Baksetball Operations as well.  No Dice there   That article was border line awful.  -"According to non-management sources"  WTF does that even mean?     http://espn.go.com/nba/story/_/id/10894198/golden-state-warriors-contact-steve-kerr-coaching-vacancy   If SVG can get Harrison Barnes to do [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21cE2aUbWB0), I'm all in!   He called out Draymond Green in the playoffs last year, also called out Iggy.  You really want to consider him a coach, let alone piss off the players even more when they hear Karl could be a candidate?  No thanks    This F.O's message is to win now, not later.  I'm fine with that, and that message has been consistent throughout it all.  I want to see the same high standard held to the players, I.E Klay accountable for his poor shot selection, Steph with multiple turn overs, Lee and his lack of defense.    I guess what I'm saying is that if the F.O is this serious, expect some major moves this summer to push the chips all in.    	113

    My point is that she's a glorious looking woman - look at those cheekbones!  This is an unflattering picture of her.  [This one is better](https://i.imgur.com/e80TKjb.jpg)            I open your mother in one tab and your sister in another tab   Voat rhymes with Gloat and smells like my Boat   ooooooo INFOLIARS.COM must be real!      What an unflattering picture of her   Lol and consider what the TSA calls a "weapon", that means I have literally thousands (I'm a surgeon)   1.  the game is physically slow.  It could be a hardware issue.  Are there ways to tweak the settings so it's not so graphically intense outside of the game settings (I've reduced all of those to minimum).  2.  any idea how to do that?  3.  how do I turn on the default controls?   Isn't it time for the voatards to just leave?      Just downloaded and installed Witcher 3 for PC.    Some problems:  1.  it's slow - any way to speed up the action (witcher runs in slow mo, etc)  2.  mouse is really sensitive, even on the lowest setting it spins witcher around if I'm not careful  3.  key bindings say "none" - do I have to set key bindings on everything or is there a default setting?

No objective            You think this is hard?  LOL               The author obviously is not a redditor.  /r/conspiratard is a joke subreddit meant to poke fun at /r/conspiracy and other conspiracy subreddits.  it's not to be taken seriously.         The population is going down across the board, and teens are not looking for jobs (recent NY Times article).  76,000,000 Americans are either retiring soon (including myself), or are already retired (the Baby Boomers).  Where's the incentive to have children now?  America's birth rate is the lowest it's ever been, 12.7 per 1,000 people in 2013.    We're not having babies and we're dying off.  Millennials and teenagers are not looking for work.  I suspect that many of these old jobs will disappear as people resign from them   Oh, so what you're saying is they don't have a legitimate beef with Leviticus?  If that were correct, that what's all this BS about gay marriage being a sin?   I agree with you, but I just can't imagine the hippy-freaks from the Green party joining up with the gun toting freedom 'tards of the Libertarian Party          If Reddit sold more advertising, I would suspect it of being clickbait   who   I think their god has left the building   So what.  No point in getting your jammies in a bunch because I'm practicing safe internet and others are not.  It's a matter of personal choice.   Good point.  If they are all god fearing Christians...I wonder about other things Leviticus has outlawed and what they've quit because of them:    1  Burning any yeast or honey in offerings to God  2  Failing to include salt in offerings to God  3  Eating fat  4  Eating blood  5  Failing to testify against any wrongdoing youve witnessed   6  Failing to testify against any wrongdoing youve been told about   7  Touching an unclean animal  8  Carelessly making an oath  9  Deceiving a neighbour about something trusted to them  etc   And it's all good :)   Wikileaks may be a limited hangout, it certainly is suspicious.  I won't go near it with a 10' pole   [BS](https://i.imgur.com/LR758Vh.gif)  #1 - we've already outsourced most of our jobs to Mexico, China and India.  Nothing new here  #2 - copyright is already a thing.  you will be fined if you sell something that's copyrighted without permission, you may even go to jail.  #3 - admittedly this may be bad, but inspections in the US have been bad for over 30 years.  In my state alone, there is only 1 inspector for over 1,000 funeral homes and veterinarian hospitals...some of these places haven't been inspected in 10-15 years.    #4 - as a medical doctor in a busy ER, we are already seeing how much control pharmacy companies have over the hospital.  It can't get worse than it already is (bad)  #5 - from the language of the article, it is not clear whether or not environmental protections are indeed affected by this.     [BS](https://i.imgur.com/LR758Vh.gif)  This is not evidence, it is speculation and it's very thin   Where's your evidence of this?  This ruling has been coming for a few years.        Just go and sit in the back...get a feel for the room and during a break ask questions if you feel up to it.  Bring something to record the jam (smartphone will do), and have fun.  if someone offers you a chance to solo, don't try to rock out - just do flatruns if you want, they are easy and conservative and sound pretty good...later, when you've had more experience, you can rock out on solos.   Because the bird is still living   I suppose it's the right thing to do to leave if you can't do the work for some reason.   Once I switched over permanently to DDG, I noticed there are a bunch of blog sites that automatically share these 'tard articles: Above Top Secret, Godlike Productions, Democratic Underground, Natural News, Infowars, Veterans Today....it's like they are a hive mind and share this stuff around hoping something or someone will pick it up and think it's legit   I agree with you on that.  I use Bing for video search because youtube is not the default in Bing, which is great.  A lot of musicians I like won't use Youtube for various reasons, so I can find them more easily on Bing   You're right.  Most people are still using Internet Explorer.  Over 60,000,000 Americans still use AOL   Medical purposes?  Robots?  This whole sex robot thing is actually a thing...   They can be made by humans, and they have been made, but they are also still made by seemingly random events or weather - in seconds, not hours - with unexplained conditions (flattening of stems without crushing or snapping, for example).   This supreme court decision to make same sex marriage legal in all states is the greatest step forward for atheism we've had in 100 years   ajw.asahi.com is a Japanese website in English.  Not sure why it would crash your site unless you're blocked       I have location settings turned off.  I don't want Google building an index of things I search for in my locations   Exactly.  I will also.  For example: Pizza, Amherst   I wish they had a better Android App...I'd use it   I've used DDG for several years now.  My wife uses Chrome with Google as the default search.  Every once in a while when I pick up her laptop to look up something quickly, I'm amazed at the junk and the bloat that Google will load on the first page!           Dude who wrote this has no idea how reddit works.  Conspiratard is a joke subreddit, created for mocking this one and others.     I'm still waiting for the EMP that was supposed to happen in Texas almost a month agao   Watch it again   I'm sure you're right.  Testosterone and cocaine don't mix!   Flowers    ZetaTalk  "we, the Zetas" lol that's some fanciful nonsense                     I came to Reddit about 8 years ago from Fark.com  There were only a few hundred people using it at the time.  It was a great community.  I remember when people started comparing it to Digg...that was a huge kerfuffle when that all happened...and a bunch of top Digg submitters created subreddits here and became bigwigs again and the controversy and the naysayers and the whiners... this is just another "thing" and those people who are upset most by it will leave as they did during the last two or three "things" that have blown up on Reddit in recent years.  Meanwhile, I'll stay here, enjoying the site as I did 8 years ago.   Hey OP, don't come back!   DDG doesn't have as many relevant searches as Google for things such as videos and images, but it is a much better search engine for delivering relevant results without all the claptrap and bloat Google wants you to see   I hope these dissenters leave Reddit, and soon.  I suspect they all came after Digg died.  They have short attention spans and will go wherever the latest trend takes them   I'm glad.  I hope they all leave and soon.  Then we can get back to enjoying it as it was intended            Did you see that rant from McCain this week?  He's pissed that we're still buying rockets from Russia.  Well, sir, maybe you should have ensured the NASA budget passed each year?   That one cop talked about a bad odor inside, not a sewage odor, but something smelly.                                                3 "doctors" in quotes.         aww...that's really nice of you :)  See?  This is the kind of comment that makes friends, not like your bullshit, icecreammachine   Voat smells like goat and rhymes with boat   eat me you piece of shit.  I've reported you (not that it matters at this point with all the bullshit going on around here).  But you're now on my shit list   Due to the number of trolls that have followed me over here from /r/Korea, I have to limit the number of approved submitters for a time.  If you would like to be an approved submitter, please PM me!   Who buys reddit gold?  I"ve never bought it and never will.  By the way, I've used adblock since the 1990s                  OP, you're out of the loop         Very true.  But it's a nice gesture :)                  Actually, I was drafted as a medic during the Vitenam war.  Best OJT there is      No   Calling this person a doctor would be like calling my plumber a surgeon   Where are the fucking aliens, Wikileaks?  That's what we care about!   Not that covert if this moron knows about them   I haven't watched tv since 1998    I'm a doctor with an MD from an accredited medical school.  These are "doctors"   It always amazes me that people really talk like that, they're not fooling around.  When I was a medic in Saigon, one of my nurses had an accent so thick you'd have to squint to hear English there somewhere   you mean "InfoLiars.com"?  yeah     Exactly!  Where's the EMP?  Fema coffins?  Death camps?  Death panels?  Fear Theater   Try or don't try.  I don't care either way   Foreigners?  MERS is directly affecting the native population.  There have been zero instances of foreigners with the disease      over the last 9 years of being a member here (obviously this is not my original account), I've had hundreds of front page posts.  you can't take it to the bank  nobody IRL cares   We lived near the Army base because they provided a discounted rent system (this was over 20 years ago)...later, we moved closer to my sister-in-law in Seocho-gu because my wife wanted to be near family.   I thought it was going to be at Hampshire?      Still waiting for your EMP that never happened.  When are you textards going to realize jade helm is what the govt says it is, a training exercise?   Here's the OP's original text  The original thread where this all started: https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/345ssr/rconspiracy_new_queue_moments_ago_notice_anything/cqriaap  The more recent thread where it was discussed: http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/3bf43o/the_modtalkleaks_continue_major_moderators_caught/  If you dont want to sift through the above threads, the TL;DR is this: He got caught using alts to upvote and agree with himself as well as creating SRD threads to discredit the sub. Despite the indisputable truth, Flytape bullied the other mods into removing his ban, thus calling into question his own motives for allowing someone who clearly works to discredit a sub that "he cares about" to continue to shit up everything he posts on. Now they are both lying to cover up the trail.  Blacksunalchemy has now deleted those accounts even though there are artifacts of them still around (such as the redditfun link you can find in the thread). At the time of the instance, I sent several mods the info and they all agreed that he was, in fact, clearly engaging in this behavior, but Flytape continues to bully them and protect his "buddy".  He is now back on a new alt, GorgleGoo, and started gaming the sub to try and establish credibility by posting in his own thread here: https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/3bmwac/cops_livid_over_proposed_police_reform_measures/csnno6v  Fortunately other users noticed this strange behavior and called him out on another thread he derailed here: https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/3bmqbt/pentagon_changes_laws_of_war_to_declare/  He follows the same MO every time: 1) Disrupt and derail the conversation with garbage. 2) When this is pointed out, claim to be an honest arbiter for the truth. 3) If that fails, then claim that you are an innocent victim of these baseless attacks!  One thing that I noticed and found extremely curious is that, on his new alt, he used an acronym that I only remember seeing one other place: https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/3bmqbt/pentagon_changes_laws_of_war_to_declare/csoaxzk  I consider myself a CT  This immediately brought to mind another user who constantly disrupts and harasses others on the sub, CT_Warlock. This would follow the naming convention that he likes of dark wizard stuff from MagicTG blacksunalchemy and nomed_yob (boy demon). 100% proof? Nope but just another coincidence that I thought should be pointed out.  Furthermore, lets also not forget that he likes to claim to be a video expert. He draws signs in photoshop for a living as he has freely admitted several times. Nothing wrong with that. This, however, does not make one an expert in video, which he claims to be in order to make the invalid argument from authority in order to debunk others. I, for instance, am a materials scientist, but I dont claim to be an expert in rocketry just because they also call themselves scientists the whole idea of that is absurd. Example of him debunking the faked ISIS videos here: https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/2thvuu/debunked_the_latest_isis_video_of_two_japanese/  Since we cannot count on the mods to help the situation on this subreddit, and even have to question what motivation Flytape would have for defending a user who was caught red-handed gaming the sub and posting SRD threads to discredit the sub, I think it is only prudent that the userbase be the ones to police themselves.  Great job to those in that thread who caught on quickly to his games and called him out. We need to be the change that we want to see. Keep up the good work, guys.  submitted by BeneathTheRainbow    I don't have time to game a system, I'm just here for the lulz   Finally!    What about InfoLiars.com an Veteranstoday.com?  When are you going to ban them?   waste of my time      How can sharing articles about an outbreak that is still killing people be "fear mongering"?      [this is for you](https://i.imgur.com/eAfXb4c.png)   Hardly.  My wife's sister was at Samsung when this whole thing broke out.        gross.  I hate hangers, especially on a fat young person...you know they'll be wrinkly and down around her knees when she's 30   Me too.  That guy from vermont said he doesn't believe in a god, he's pro gun, pro choice, wants to bring jobs and manufacturing back to the states...what's his name bernie something   A lot of shops sell Eastmans though.  For example, Gruhn's guitars, Gianna's Violins (TN), Music Emporium in Arlington, Fretted Instrument Workshop in Amherst, Ma   I second that.  Best instrument in that price range   ugh   That's what I'm thinking.     If you grew up in the hilltowns or even the countryside, I would understand your confusion, but down here in the city/urban areas (springfield/holyoke), it's a rare sight.  That's why it's interesting.   please post the original article with the sourced links      I have hundreds.  Let's start with yours, because they should be easy to produce   we can only hope   Can you link to an example, oh heck since you say they are all "heavily sourced", how about the latest top 3?    sighted  sighted sdd/ adjective (of a person) having the ability to see; not blind. "a sighted guide is needed" having a specified kind of sight. suffix: -sighted "the keen-sighted watcher may catch a glimpse"      The way I figure it, if they are hawking water filters, prepper supplies, medical marijuana or a book or something, then they are doing it for the money.  Of course that filter doesn't always apply.  For example, James Corbett is selling his "inside scoop" to subscribers...   James Corbett / Corbett Report is top on my list  Techdirt / FastCompany / Ars Technica for inside scoop on tech  Schneier on Security for NSA / Encryption  We Are Change (although they have gotten worse over the last year or so, linking up to InfoLiars too frequently for my taste)  The Intercept  Of the MSM, I read the New York Times headlines, and other related sites, just to get a sense of what's going on.  I skim the new posts off GLP to see if anything grabs my attention (it's mostly junk, but once in a while something interesting appears).  Then just a shitload of other middle-of the road sites that are too peripheral to mention here.  I read between the lines and don't take anything too seriously...I read them to get a general "pulse" of what's happening       It's a conspiracy, I tells ya!   I didn't post it in /r/news, I posted it in /r/massachusetts where I live.  It is interesting because there have been more reports of bear sightings not just where they are more common (like Montague for example), but in Holyoke, East Longmeadow, Northampton and Amherst.     A lot of fundies here too.  Consider the posts about the rapture and related nonsense about prophesies, etc.  Also a lot of unsourced stories that are probably hoaxes and frauds.  Consider anything from Infowars, prisonplanet, alex jones to be an outright fraud; and anything from Veterans Today to be at least 40% lies (according to Veterans Today Editor, Gordon Duff).  Sure people here are less likely to believe whatever latest crap is being trundled out by the main stream media, but there's a lot of alt media crap posted here also.   Asians have bigger brains (they are smarter than you) and wider hips than white people  	194
 Thanks for helping me clarify, see the edit!    it's all subjective my man   Speyburn Braden Orach, no age date printed on this bottle of single malt scotch.  I take my scotch one ounce at a time, room temperature, with a dash of water.   Color: pale yellow amber  Nose: yeasty, pear, orange, lemon, vanilla  Taste: honey, lemon, salt water taffy, cinnamon, faint sour watermelon candies  Finish: oily, oaky, spicy, and pleasantly long  This is a better Speyburn than the 10 year I reviewed before. I'm actually enjoying it very much.... and it costs only 21 bucks in Michigan. 80/100.  Now for the cheapskate's questionnaire:  1. How many bottles does it take to upgrade my beginner status?   2. If I considered changing my titles to "A Cheapskate's Review" what is the maximum amount I should set for myself in those reviews?   Don't worry, it's not going to keep me from periodically reviewing a pricier scotch. It's just that I see so many reviews of obscure and expensive scotch I want to give us little guys a chance. Thanks for reading!  EDIT: in question 2 by maximum amount I mean maximum amount of money in American dollars.

Scotch, scotch, scotch, here it goes down....  I take my scotch one ounce at a time, room temperature, with a dash of water.  Color: yellow like a Cheerios box  Nose: apricot, green grapes, bubblegum, clover  Taste: woody, slighty smoky, dried banana, cranberry  Finish: watery, with a spicy burn, doesn't stay with you very long  This is a good single malt for the price (33 bucks in Michigan). It's not very complex. Not bad scotch by any means... but I'm not too excited about it.  68/100  See you next bottle!        Because you're not doing it right. Don't discourage this.    So... much... goose shit. Nothing ruins a good day more than stepping in goose shit.   google "Cocaine Anonymous" or "Narcotics Anonymous" and get his ass to a meeting.

Anderson   Thanks everybody for your nice comments!    Glenfiddich 12 yr  Got my paycheck, time for another review!  I take my scotch one ounce at a time, room temperature, with a dash of water.  Color: faint orange like the stripes on a tabby cat  Nose: lime, butterscotch, nutmeg, caramel, roasted almonds  Taste: the box ain't lying when they say fresh pear, cinnamon, faint hint of mint and honey  Finish: oily, a little fire like I just finished eating a red hot candy  Overall this is the best scotch I've had so far (remember, I am a beginner!) and I can see myself buying more bottles of this in the future. I enjoy the complexity that this malt has to offer for the price, 42 bucks here in Michigan.   90/100         you're hopeless   Nobody is going to read this.   smoke some weed   More Nazi shit?

Glenmorangie 10 yr  I bought this for 44 bucks in Michigan. It was the last of an order of gift sets that my local liquor store had in stock. It came with two very classy scotch glasses that I use pretty much exclusively now. They are shaped to concentrate the nose with a weight that feels nice in the hand.   I take my scotch one ounce at a time, room temperature, with a dash of water.  Color: very pale yellow  Nose: floral, butter, potpourri  Taste: pumpkin pie, sweet potatoes with marshmallow, pecans, coconut  Finish: fine notes of toffee, very smooth, doesn't stay with you too long  72/100  Perhaps I'm spoiled in my first bottle of scotch (read my first review) but there isnt much complexity here. This scotch doesn't have much personality, but I do like it. I would probably offer it to my friends that haven't tried scotch before to get them started.            Well I've never heard of waze until now. Downloaded and installed now. Clever marketing strategy.   Is she hot? That's all that matters.   I hope Brenton finally does something about his nails.

I've always hated liqour, but I'm 30 years old now and I thought that it was about time to find a liquor I enjoy. After watching youtube videos for a while, and googling the hell out of the subject, I've decided to become a scotch drinker. Here is my first review.  The Black Grouse  I take my scotch one ounce at a time, room temperature,  with a dash of water.  Color: amber, like leaves in early fall  Nose: under-ripe oranges, lemon, hint of vanilla, maple syrup  Taste: smoke, sugar, burnt caramel  Finish: very dark chocolate, woody  As a beginner, I actually enjoyed this scotch very much. The price is right, too. Paid 26 dollars for this in Michigan. 78/100.   My next review I'll post with when I get my next paycheck. I'm going to try Glenmorangie 10 year. I love scotch!

 It's not about how I look or how I think I'll be perceived, it's just some irrational thing I don't really understand.   C'mon, it'll be fun! Who knows where we'll end up?   I sometimes meet my friends' kids who I last saw when they were 4 or younger. I try not to say much about them in those days because I know they'll feel awkward.   This. No color appears.   Asking people I don't know for things -- even salesclerks, coworkers in other departments, people whose jobs involve helping me out.   Had this happen recently. I hadn't seen this person since I was about 12, we're talking decades, and I also forgot how she knew us (her mother and my mother were ~~college~~longtime friends; I could have asked beforehand but I had the derp). It took me a while to get caught up; I hope I didn't give anything away. We got together for dinner next time she was in town, so it's nice to be caught up.   I think it's not that he sees one of those shades as purple; he sees purple as one of those shades.   "That explains your car."   Floss.

Agree on the interior space; it's amazing how not having a back seat makes the interior so much more efficient.  Disagree on the acceleration, though; the Smarts I've driven (I lived in a car2go city) have all been slow on the uptake. But apart from that they're a ton of fun, and soo easy to park. Now I live in a big city and wonder why there aren't a ton more of them.   dunda sui, la dudo de sois?   They were/are totally laid back. Still it was pretty strange.   "Oh, sing them that song you know, about the Five Constipated Men In The Bible."   Consonance too.   In some militaries the words have different meanings; a marksman has greater skill or training than the average soldier and has a specialized role in an infantry, but a sniper is even more specialized. I'd say casual usage reflects the same distinction, a "marksman" is a good shot but is not necessarily a sniper.   [Indifferent Cats In Amateur Porn](http://indifferent-cats-in-amateur-porn.tumblr.com/)   I grew up in the city where the BTK murders were happening, while they were happening. It was years before they caught the guy.  Later I moved to another city and a shopkeeper near my apartment tortured and killed six men over several years. He was caught when the seventh man escaped from his basement and went to a neighbor for help wearing only a dog collar.   A writer and an editor are lost in the desert, and just as they're about to give up hope they see an oasis. They stagger up to the pond and the writer puts his face in the water to take a long drink.

You picked a fine time to leave me, loose seal.   "Something's wrong, [the GPS isn't working](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIZVcRccCx0)."   Miranda Rights come from a 1966 Supreme Court ruling. *Dirty Harry* was released in 1971, so Harry would have gone through police academy and possibly already made detective before the SFPD started using them. So it's no surprise he didn't quite know how they worked.   I had to look to be sure I didn't write this post because it's so familiar. I was getting out of bed OK, but actually writing wasn't happening for me either.   I'll say this: If you take step a) and drop out, you may find the depression lifts because the degree obligations aren't hanging over your head. Shortly after I left, people told me I looked much more relaxed. Felt that way too.    Interesting. I'd have thought the extra few years of learning research would be more valued, sort of treating the PhD programs like farm systems in baseball (free training!). But I don't know as much about STEM as I'd like.   Noted; most of my knowledge is in social sciences. In my field (journalism/media studies) there are some journals where publication doesn't help you much -- one prof at my school was denied tenure in part, so we heard, because he was publishing in the wrong places. Some journals are actually scams, but there are so many people looking for the lines on the CV that they rope some of them in.   Yeah, the general rule is you don't pay for your own doctorate. Not worth it.   TT = Tenure track; professors want tenure because it's job security. If you're not on the track your fate is out of your hands.  I don't know your situation well enough to offer advice, but when I got out of undergrad I had a crap job for a year and realized I was better off going back. It clarified things considerably.   Maybe they have looked at the job market and decided you'll have the best shot at a TT job if you have at least 3 publications, so they make it a requirement. That would be a rational approach to the current situation.   What's odd about grad school is that you can find out when you're still partway through that it's not working out, but pushing through can seem like a less-bad option than dropping out. There's some sunk-cost fallacy going on there, though that's not all there is to it. But once you're in that situation your life can seem aimless.   Agreed.    When I say "the system is heavily biased" that's probably right. In most fields there's a quite reasonable assumption that if you enter the a PhD program you're looking for an institutional teaching or research career, since that's what they're there to prepare people for, and going a different route takes extra effort.   I don't know that there's one root, unless it's the slowness of the institution to adapt to external changes. Administration is part of it.  And PhDs have more options, and I mentioned some resources in another comment. But the system is heavily biased toward steering them into teaching jobs outside STEM and to a great extent within it.   Maybe, maybe not; you should be *learning* to generate publication-quality research. Most dissertations generate publications after graduation, not before, in part because the student is busy finishing the damn thing and doesn't have time to write up articles. (Dissertations themselves are a highly constrained format not suitable for publication as is. Everyone I know who eventually turned theirs into a book spent at least a year on the rewrite.)   Oh, that's exactly the real issue. There's a finite amount of time that the academic community can devote to peer reviewing articles and editing journals, and diminishing returns on quality set in long before the demand for publication space is close to satisfied.   What /u/brilliantjoe said, plus many universities are cutting costs by hiring adjuncts (lecturers, instructors, "visiting" profs) instead of actual professors, or alternatively ditching adjuncts and making the profs take on more or larger classes. Either way it means there's a shrinking supply of decent jobs in the field.   At least one-third of your colleagues feel the same way, possibly more. People just don't feel safe talking about it so they keep it to themselves.    Three publications as a degree condition is highly unusual IME. I could have graduated with no papers, and my colleagues in other disciplines had at most 1 publication required.   Requiring so many publications is a rotten idea also because it increases the demand for places to publish, and tons of journals spring up, many of which are crap. That makes it harder to find the worthwhile research in the sea of mediocre-to-bad articles.   Been there. Excellent advice, and there's more in the comments over there too.   I'll second especially what /u/RedBugs said and others. I left my program after 7 years when my diss proposal wasn't accepted. I'd been at it too long to have come up with so little, so there was no point in continuing. Fortunately I had been applying for non-academic jobs just in case, partly because I wasn't sure I wanted to be a professor anyway. Two days after my proposal died I had my first job interview, and I got hired and started work within a few weeks. The pay isn't quite what I'd hoped, and I'll be dealing with student loans for a while, but as I look back I realize I'm doing work I like in the city where I've always wanted to live, and I doubt that would have happened so quickly if I'd gotten the degree.   I'm already making more contacts in my non-academic field, and things are looking fairly bright from here.   Oh, a word about grief and shame: They are both natural in your situation, and they suck, but you don't need to feel bad *about* having those feelings. It's like breaking up with your SO after 8 years. You'll feel a deep sense of loss for a while, then eventually things will get better. Not today, probably not tomorrow, but not too long from now.  One more thing: check with your school to see if they provide access to the services at [Versatile PhD](http://versatilephd.com/); their rasion d'etre is helping academics, both PhDs and ABDs, to find good careers in the "real world." You can pay for your own subscription if need be, and it may be worth it to you. I was lucky to get a job before I needed their services much, but I'm pretty impressed with their resources.   Been there. For some of us there's just some mental block about actually Getting It Done that we can't go around. I've heard it called Dissertation Paralysis. I talked a psychologist at my school into starting a support group for just that sort of thing, and (irony of ironies) it didn't get me over the hump, but a couple of other people in the group said they probably wouldn't have finished without it.   One difficulty we face as PhD students is that "diss paralysis" is never talked about; either you're making progress or you're not, and the professors (who all *did* succeed so they may not "get it") have a limited set of ways to deal with it. I'm hoping that that support group, which is still up and running (and spawned at least one offshoot writing group), will lead to more openness and support in that area.  Once I recognized the diss paralysis problem for what it is I started talking it up at academic conferences. Some people seemed interested in learning more, because they do want to help the students finish and graduate, but it's still a ways from being seen as a normal thing that happens to many of us.   What's in your cart can suggest whether you're not married (lots of single-serving items, say). It slightly raises the odds above random chance that whoever we're approaching won't be already partnered up. And for some guys, any edge in the odds is enough.   My closest encounter was shopping at an antique/oddity stall called Bob's Bazaar Bizarre in the Westport Flea Market in Kansas City. The proprietor was Bob Berdella, who was later imprisoned for torturing and killing six male prostitutes over the course of four years. I don't remember much about him.   I suspect that most successful TV shows succeed because they create characters the audience can care about and relate to, so when they get into a not-too-original situation each episode it's still new-ish because we see how *these* characters respond. Sci-fi can make such characters, but since each episode "has" to have SF elements there's less opportunity to develop the characters or to put them in situations where they don't end up phase-blasting their way out. It can be done, but it's not easy.  BSG succeeded in part because early on it put a LOT of resources into world-building so that the writers could plausibly replicate just about any dramatic situation. "Labor strife, but in space." "Ethnic discrimination, but in space." "Rigged elections, but in space." They had much more range and didn't need as many old tropes as other series.   In particular, it's usually Nike athletic shorts and a T-shirt, and usually in a combination that suggest the person dressed in the dark or is color-blind.  What also gets me is that the "official" T-shirts that people wear to the games and so forth are either burnt orange or ... hot pink. And groups of people on game days wear both. It's hideous. (I like burnt orange when it's paired with colors it works with, which unfortunately are few.)   What do you call 64 white people in a room?  One full-blooded Cherokee.   From my time in academia, I'd say that the farther you progress, the more you know about a narrower range of subjects as you specialize more and more. So you learn a lot, but it's an inch wide and a mile deep, and so you feel as if you're dumb about everything else.   He's just having a catnap.   My history teacher in high school had a twin who taught at a different school in town, and she said they sometimes taught each other's classes. I have no idea if they did it while I was in their class, since they never gave it away while it was happening.   Second PCL. I always bring a jacket or sweatshirt.   If they wanted to promote a professional atmosphere, they'd either post the *entire* code or just say "follow the freakin' dress code, people." What they actually did is cherry-pick the code (which is not on UT's website anywhere) specifically to single out women as the cause of whatever problem it is they are claiming to solve.    UT acknowledged it, and said it was "poorly worded" and that it would be taken down.    I'm told there's also a pig about town named Peter Porker. He goes for walks on the LBL trail now and again.   I think that number is wrong, or at least misleading. Wikipedia says the entire TAMU system has 28K faculty and staff. To get to 50K you probably have to count graduate assistants, adjuncts, and part-time student workers.  	55
 That's true and one of the points they and others looked at in more detail later on in subsequent studies. This lead to comparison of a wider range of jobs and the effects of physical activity and exercise on life expectancy, with being more physically active correlating to increased life expectancy.      Weightlifting (well strength technically) appears to have an additive effect to cardiovascular exercise. However, cardiovascular fitness appears to be better at decreasing mortality than strength.  This study compared the bottom, middle and top 3rd of strength in a group of patients and looked at mortality rate to a range of conditions (primarily cancer and old age).  The basic message is that the stronger you are the longer you live. In terms of cardiovascular "fit" patients those in the bottom 3rd of strength were more likely to die than those in the top 2/3rds. However, cardiovascular fitness appeared to have a bigger effect on decreasing mortality than strength. It's important to note that only strength was measured not if they weight lifted.   Study: http://www.bmj.com/content/337/bmj.a439   I posted a reply to somebody else that may help with what is physical activity.    An interesting side note/point is that the original studies of benefits of physical activity actually came from observations of the incidence of heart attacks between bus drivers and conductors on London buses. Bus drivers were significantly more likely to have heart disease than the conductors - so same environment but one is sitting and the other is standing and get on and off the bus. These studies were published in the 1950 and 60s and an example of one can be seen here (from 1958) if anyone is interested (I think it's open access - at uni so not sure but it's PMC)    http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2027542/pdf/brmedj03082-0009.pdf  EDIT: took out exercise and replaced with physical activity   That's a good question and is a little difficult to answer because people have different fitness levels and it depends on how fast you're walking etc. During my undergrad I had a module covering this type of thing and have loosely followed it since. These are 3 ways that have been used to measure/determine moderate physical activity.    1. You should be able to talk but not sing whilst performing the activity (this was used in a program I helped out in for type II diabetic patients prescribed/recommended exercise and I think still used for NHS based exercise recommendations).    2. To aim for level 12-14 on the Borg scale. The borg scale is a qualitative "rate of perceived exertion" that studies find correlate fairly well to heart rate and oxygen consumption. It's not perfect as it's qualitative but is used in the field as it is easy for people to answer and cheap. An example can be seen here http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/borg-scale/    3. A more quantitative approach for walking was done in this study (it is paywalled) http://www.ajpmonline.org/article/S0749-3797(09)00087-7/abstract They found that in general 100 steps/min would count as moderate exercise and recommended doing them in at least 10min long bouts. Again, individual differences may mean that you need less than 100 or more than 100 steps/min.    Hopefully that helps you better gauge if walking around town or not is moderate exercise for you or not  EDIT: adjusted Borg scale from 12 to 12-14. 12-14 is the scale typically used as moderate exercise, 12 was what was used in a study I helped out in for diabetic patients as explained below and I forgot to put the range in.   From this method? I'd say no as: 1. they needed 1000 volts to generate maximum contraction  2. From a 25mm x 5mm square they got a maximum deflection of 1mm 3. the forces generated are low (they didn't show a specific force but from the images and data I'd suggest that they're at least 200 times weaker than normal muscle of similar thickness/size).   So basically they're very weak and getting a power supply of 1000V in a limb would be difficult and maybe dangerous (physics isn't my specialty but I don't know of a compact, lightweight and long-lasting 1000V power supply - someone else might be able to shed light on that)  Taking concepts from this study and other studies? Then yeah definitely there are potential ways of making prosthetic limbs. The best paper I've seen is this one http://www.sciencemag.org/content/343/6173/868 where the fibers they make are stronger than human muscle. For the paper I linked more work needs to be done to make these behave how you'd like in a prosthetic limb but progress is definitely being made.     Something I put on another post about this:  The term muscle in these studies is a little misleading and a bit confusing. The "muscles" they make are not meant to be used in people but in machines as actuators.  They took the outer layer of an onion (the epidermis) as at the microscopic level it mimicked a very basic muscle structure (aligned, densely packed rectangles in the onion vs aligned, densely packed cylinders in native muscle).   They then freeze-dried it to get rid of water and to make it structurally stable. This meant that they had a sheet that kind of looked like a muscle but obviously without any contractile proteins to make the structure contract.  To get the muscle to contract the added/plated a very thin layer of gold to both sides of their onion layer. Gold is electrostatic, so when the applied a voltage they could get their onion layer to move due to electrostatic forces. Essentially the same basic science as when you rub a balloon against a surface (the voltage in this study) and it makes your hair (in this case the artificial "muscle") stick up.  I don't know enough about these artificial "muscles" to know the significance of the work but it's a pretty cool proof of concept. If this will translate to something you can buy or will wind up in electronics I'd assume not as down the line somebody will engineer a polymer or plastic that does this.

This must be one of the worst science journalist articles (i.e. the newspaper piece) that I've ever read.  Quotes from the lead author:  "Understanding this pattern of telomere growth **may** mean it can be a predictive biomarker for cancer,"  "with the right testing these procedures could be used to **eventually** diagnose a wide variety of cancers."  From an insurance agent/spokesman: **If** this test showed 100 per cent probability over a certain number of years then it could affect premiums  It's a good reminder to scientists that you need to be crystal clear when talking to journalists about work, the lead author said nothing misleading at all but probably should have explicitly stated something along the lines of  "this work may lead to a predictive biomarker for cancer in the future but in it's current form and with our current understanding cannot currently be used as a clinical prediction of cancer". (Maybe somebody less tired can create a more succinct soundbite lol)   A brief simplified background into how this works and the findings of paper:  The immune system typically targets and destroys abnormal cells such as cancer cells. However, some cancer cells can "hide" from the immune system by modulating how the immune cells work. Melanomas are pretty good at doing this and this trial uses 2 drugs that target 2 distinct pathways/mechanisms which melanomas use to "hide" from the immune system. Previous work in animals and one other clinical trial had shown that targeting both pathways was much more effective than just targeting one pathway. This paper saw the same thing, that a combination therapy (i.e. targeting both pathways), was more effective than using one drug. Effectiveness meant longer progression-free survival and increased chance of tumor reduction (not all patients had this on the treatment but your chance of having this increased).  This was a Phase 1 trial - the purpose of these trials is to make sure that the drugs are safe to administer to people and to determine what dose/amount of drug to give. This was also a double-blind trial - this means that both the patients and doctors don't know what treatment had been given until after the trial ends. This is important as it helps negate the placebo effect and doctors unintentionally introducing bias. Phase I trials are typically focused on finding safe doses and don't always have to find a positive effect to move onto Phase II due to the small number of patients used in these studies. Seeing a positive effect is a good thing but due to the small number of people it could be a statistical fluke (the clear effect they saw very strongly suggests that it isn't), so a Phase II trial will start with more patients enrolled and long-term effects/outcomes recorded.  The main purpose of a Phase 1 is to determine safety, with the combination therapy they had 3 cases where doctors thought the therapy may be responsible for sudden death (it does not mean it will kill you but is why these studies are done before giving it everybody with melanoma). Also of patients who stopped combination therapy, 45% stopped due to adverse events (such as uncontrolled vomiting, diarrhea etc.). This is not surprising as combination therapy tend to cause more side effects, side effects can sometimes/often be lessened and controlled given time and experience with using the drugs (e.g. doctors will find which anti-emetics work best with this treatment the more patients they treat and experience they get with the drug).  The safety aspect is one reason why they did the case report on the lady who had such amazing tumor reduction. It lets other doctors know to look out for that type of reaction/outcome and that an extreme effect might be seen in some patients. Additionally, researchers will like to figure out why she had such a strong response as it could help in the design of the next generation of drugs and help screen people who might have such a strong response so they can be monitored more carefully.  This is not a "cure" as they only looked one year into treatment and disease progression still occurred in many subjects - it delayed disease progression suggesting that it would give you more time to live. The study was done in patients with advanced (stage III and IV) melanoma, so it might be more effective at an earlier stage (it also might not be). They also saw that the effectiveness was not linked to having a BRAF v600 mutation or not. BRAF mutations are thought to be responsible for 50% of melanomas so it suggests that this combination treatment *should* work in the majority of cases (it does not mean it *will* work in all melanomas and patients either).   Overall, the findings are really positive. More trials will take place, the treatment regimen will likely be tweaked to improve it's efficacy and hopefully it'll be found to be safe and effective in the larger studies. If I had melanoma and was eligible I'd try and get involved in a trial with this treatment and discuss it with my oncologist.    	9
                                              In the United States there is no specific constitutional guarantee on the privacy of correspondence. The secrecy of letters and correspondence is derived through litigation from the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution. In an 1877 case the U.S. Supreme Court stated:   No law of Congress can place in the hands of officials connected with the Postal Service any authority to invade the secrecy of letters and such sealed packages in the mail; and all regulations adopted as to mail matter of this kind must be in subordination to the great principle embodied in the fourth amendment of the Constitution.   The protection of the Fourth Amendment has been extended beyond the home in other instances. A protection similar to that of correspondence has even been argued to extend to the contents of trash cans outside one's house, although unsuccessfully. Like all rights derived through litigation, the secrecy of correspondence is subject to interpretations. By Supreme Court precedent, rights derived from the Fourth Amendment are limited by the legal test of a "reasonable expectation of privacy".   What if britain withdraws from the European Court of human rights?  This is exactly what the Tories are talking.  http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/oct/03/tories-plan-uk-withdrawal-european-convention-on-human-rights  You see your entire copypasta argument supporting guaranteed rights instantly falls apart.   In the US, the Bill of Rights is seen as a sacred text, with any violation intolerable.   Also compare this to the UK government where the will legally justify mass surveillance   http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jun/17/mass-surveillance-social-media-permitted-uk-law-charles-farr   So I'm certainly not the idiot here.  Top tip. Don't use copy pasta.  http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/oct/24/gchq-nsa-surveillance-scandal   I think the citizens take it seriously and slowly those rights becomes an election issue.  The current government might not care until then.      Proofs that you can be a statue while being unable to grow a proper beard   http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/oct/24/gchq-nsa-surveillance-scandal   I believe that virtually every single one of our international dank memes was invented or codified by the people of Chennai.    Fuck Comcast   Stopping these sneaky moves is important and necessary. But it's like bailing water out of a leaky boat. To plug the leak, reduce the influence of money in politics.   While your OP   is certainly aired in jest, I honestly believe we are in the midst of history in the making. While trying to avoid buying into hype and grandeur, let me elaborate a moment.  We've all read some writings from Thomas Jefferson, Alexander Hamilton (this guy is a true hero), Ben Franklin, Thomas Paine, John Adams (no less a hero, ironically HATED Hamilton), etc on these very topics. Similar was their plight and equal was their discontent, though it would inevitably grow much stronger nearer the Revolution itself. Their established, respected government encroached upon their fundamental rights. It was nothing new then, it's nothing new now.  Having watched the video, I am unable to separate them it from those letters and well known quotables from patriots long gone. Granted, no one is asking for revolution, at least, no one of any sense. But the fact remains that one day these silly little sketches from from a silly show finding their way to a website like may find their way into the textbooks text-tablets of our grandchildren. Will they speak of an evil, failed coup to cripple the Government's (No doubt by then the word will carry a capital G while the word "god" will not) enforcement of the law? Or will they be the words of activists who fought for human rights against an overreaching body?   For all of our sakes, for our children's sakes, I sincerely hope it is the latter. May changes to policy, and more importantly, the world's attitude towards these issues, come swiftly and peacefully.  Let me pre-empt the critics.  Yes  some are reluctant to compare Snowden to the likes of Jefferson and Franklin. Please do not misunderstand. I know it's a big jump, but I don't see it as immediately inappropriate. Americans hold certain historical figures up high as a manner of culture. They deserve our respect and gratitude, but in truth they were humans who spoke up in their times. They were farmers, business men, lawyers. Both sets (activists then and now) committed treason in the name of human rights, and that is to be respected.  Now, we do not need a new bill with his face on it or anything. My position is simply that these events and issues will undoubtedly be marked in history, and that Snowden has had no small part in it.   #NSALookAtMyDick may well be an important chapter and history in the making.

The trouble I find with that system is that it invites exceptions and conflicts  e.g. data protection act versus anti-terror legislation.  The American system isn't great but its simplicity seems better equipped for people to point to fundamental higher rights when making arguments.  Maybe a trained lawyer would have no problem describing the UK system but I get confused by it and don't find it empowering.

This is what I'm talking about   [This was my sauce](http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/oct/24/gchq-nsa-surveillance-scandal).  Funny that their comment of the week is something lauding them.    At the top of the Pyramid and you have the Rothschilds, the British Crown and the Vatican.  You can make a noise about lizard people to distract and create ridicule.  However, you cannot hide back the truth which is evident in the media every day.   Virtually every single one of our international sports were invented or codified by the British. Ping-pong was invented on the dining tables of England in the 19th century, and it was called Wiff-waff! And there, I think, you have the difference between the British and the rest of the world. Other nations, like the French, looked at a dining table and saw an opportunity to have dinner; the British saw it as an opportunity to play Wiff-waff.   So yeah you may call me 'Murican but I know why we have table tennis and why it ain't no ping pong.

The Queen has a weekly meeting alone with the Prime Minister.  You can be sure that they don't just drink tea.   I think the bbc must remain neutral.  If there is a message, things like games help individuals see the problem, futility and perhaps the solution for themselves   In the UK, the data protection act has teeth and is a hugely important for how organisations go about their business.   Not sure about exemptions but things like counter terrorist legisalation must make plenty of those for GCHQ. https://www.gov.uk/data-protection/the-data-protection-act      The Sovereigns assent is required to all bills passed by Parliament in order for them to become law.  This means that the Queen and British Crown is in ultimately in charge.  Never forget that.  England will prevail.     They are just afraid of how legislation will be used.  Look at the mess that the European court of human rights has caused and how it has crept much further than expected.     The guardian is a leader on promoting the snowden leaks and disemination of information. That is *why* I mention it.  Now ask yourself - what if a country offers justice, justice in the form of a charter of liberties, allowing every man to forage for his hearth, to be safe from conviction without cause or prison without charge, to work, eat and live on the sweat of his own brow - and be as merry as he can.  That would be a free and land.  But it would require a royal decree.   In tyranny lies only failure. Empower every man and all will gain strength   That guy is a personal hero of mine.     Rise and rise again until lambs become lions.   Every man's home *is* his castle.   Check the top of the Pyramid and you have the Rothschilds, the British Crown and the Vatican.      Everywhere else is like Britain.  It is the empire on which the sun never sets.   The US government is concerned with the actions of the NSA because citizens have rights expressly declared in the Constitution. The NSA has violated those rights which delegitimizes the government itself. So the situation is taken seriously.  Elsewhere like Britain, there are no guaranteed rights.

On December 2nd, 2013 a man was shot in Iceland by police officers after shooting two of them with a shotgun (both officers survived).  He was not killed immediately, but died in the hospital later, because the shot was meant to subdue him, not kill him.  The Icelandic police force publicly apologized to the man's family and offered counseling to the officers involved.

    Stop downvoting /u/thatscrap. He's asking genuine questions and wants to get informed about how this works. Nothing wrong with that.    I'm so glad that The Ed Show is on 5:00-6:00. That's a really prime spot to have right at the end of the work day when people are getting home and it gives Bernie a lot of good exposure when Ed Schultz talks him up.     It's actually only been flying at the State House since 1962. In 2000, it was removed from the dome of the State House and moved to its current position next to the Confederate War Memorial.    The flag that was first put on top of the State House in 1962 was the Tennessee Confederate flag, which is the traditional, rectangular version we think of usually. It's well-accepted that that flag was used in defiance of the civil rights movement at the time. That flag was taken down from the State House in 2000 and the Battle Flag took it's place in front of the State House. It's only been on the grounds for about 50 years, so anyone arguing that it is a part of our state's heritage, is in denial.    If anyone wants to look up the current law regarding the flag, it's S.C. Code Ann. 1-10-10 (1976). The South Carolina General Assembly is only in session from the beginning of January to the end of June, just six months of the year. Hopefully the plan involves some kind of special session of the General Assembly to address the flag issue, otherwise any bill would have to wait to be considered until 2016. Unfortunately, that's just how the timing of this attack worked out.   Edit: Based on Nikki Haley's speech, it looks like she'll invoke her executive powers to extend the legislative session to ensure that the flag removal legislation will make it to the floor and be voted on.   Edit 2: 6 legislators from the South Carolina Black Caucus will be introducing a resolution to amend the General Assembly's agreement for adjournment to include debate on removing the Confederate flag from the State House grounds and to include debate on hate crime legislation. South Carolina currently has no hate crime statutes.     	7

 what all is enabled in www.youtube.com/html5 ?   Try browsing in safe-mode and see if its happening. If not you have to disable individual add-ons and check   you could reduce the zoom to fit all the tabs into your view though;  im not sure why it happens, for me it shows all properly even with the search bar.    probably you could file a bug on this     Only Williams deserved; everybody else just got lucky :'(   Why Williams why? :'(  I condemn you Ferrari and Merc for today :(   Check your zoom level on that page, maybe resetting it to 100% could help   nope. you need both but a higher level of R D.      yup :D   Saying "I know, right!"   If you know it then shut up!    The lack of trained professionals is a global HR issue with a circular solution.    True but as long as organization who just want trained talent without any training, things will not progress.   True we don't lack talent.   The problem is freshers aren't being recruited or are not giving any form of training after getting out of an engineering college.    Without that skill the talent is wasted and you have a massive unemployment.   Big firms want people with experience and where do you get experience from the new talent pool or without any training?   Small firms also want people with experience because they need a solid direction and skills to survive.    Hope things get better.      For you probably a [new profile](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/profile-manager-create-and-remove-firefox-profiles) would work out.   Remember to back up data, create a new profile and let it run, and if things are going smoothly try replacing with the backed up files(if you really need them)    As OP edited post - a refresh worked out for him :)   china got its stuff because they hacked out the pentagon http://rt.com/news/223947-snowden-pentagon-china-hack/   On their own creative standards they are far behind.   That being said they know how to make quality things for the cost they get paid to manufacture.     The helicopter lands, and it looks like a model/mini helicopter. Totally distracted me  Yes     I dont think they'll give away military tech. Very few countries and companies do that.   From what it looks like we are just going to be a manufacturing hub and they can benefit from the low cost here, and we could probably benefit from a employment perspective.   Actual R D wise its hard to say we are heading for an improvement.   R D is critical or else we end up like China - a manufacturing giant   now It would be great if people here are hired    2012,2013,2014...   Moto g user, I love it.    No one seems to have a better optimized spec that Motorola to run android smooth on 1gb   Ah nope XD    Lots of pages I visit don't have the share button's, some are placed at the top and some at the bottom or sometimes under a tiny menu of different social networks.   So this button does come in handy.    refresh is the better soultion for now.   Or else your best bet will be a new profile(keep a back up of the old one also, and try replacing the required files after things work out)   ive edited just check it out!   what OS are your on?   problem is something went off in about:config  EDIT(in-case on Windows/similar for Linux):   Have these values set to "True":   "media.mediasource.enabled";"media.mediasource.format-reader.mp4";"media.mediasource.mp4.enabled"    And these too:   "media.format-reader.mp4";"media.fragmented-mp4.enabled";"media.fragmented-mp4.exposed"    If things dont work out Try Help-Troubleshoot Info-Refresh; you'll lose your add-ons but mostly data will be safe.

Have an easy to click button instead of searching the whole webpage for a share button   in about:config set "media.mediasource.webm.enabled" to true.   Warning - playback will be buggy. Its better to use the mp4 instead.    Verify on youtube.com/html5    and rightclick video's to know what format you are being served     save for webM it actually works pretty good once you enable in about:config   you might have a faulty OS install or a bad Network card.   I had this driver getting uninstalled thing because the network card was busted and worked when it wanted to work :|    Also check for antivirus or malware     it can mostly be attributed to graphic card. Have you installed the proper driver?   You could use powertop to control different stuff to increase battery life as well   you could also look into MyPaint and Krita as well.   Practice now and be better at it later :)   yeah i hangout there at times :)   Does it happen is safe mode as well?

Decided to return the machine for  Ironhide seems to be outdated. Progress has been happening on [bumblebee](http://bumblebee-project.org/).    Been working great for me :)    another tip is to fix a particular channel on your router.    wifi analyzer on android could help to find the best wifi channel for your router.      Intel - N 7260    There seems to be a driver here - https://wireless.wiki.kernel.org/en/users/Drivers/iwlwifi    Im guessing if you're on the latest kernel things should be smooth.    I have a rather strange issue when i got my ext. HD connected, wifi becomes choppy. Some signal interference by the HD.    HiDPI:   ah i can understand, hopefully a complete fix shall come in soon!    Firefox and Chrome have been adapted for this but i guess you have to pass some parameters.     Ah true :) Goodluck :)   i'd suggest bumblebee for Optimus stuff - pretty easy to configure!   who makes your wifi card?

Photoshop runs awesome on android, i still dont understand why they can't port to desktop Linux.   The cloud move was nice but browser/network reliability seems to be an issue.       Of course it's been ruling the internet server space and now mobiles for sometime. W00t!    hehe yeah! :D   [Elemetary OS](http://elementary.io/) has done a major major job on polishing Linux for the mainstream - they still need work on the marketing though   KDE 5 is still with the Shiny shiny graphics(I love it) but i've moved onto GNOME3(which is more flat in look and switching between apps fast is just out-of-the-world)   There are still polishing touches required in GNOME3 but i can live and work with it without any problems.  I still stick with [Fedora](https://getfedora.org/) because it suits be well and has everything latest.   Ubuntu and Debain are pretty good in terms of usability and stability(Debian is KING)     keep a look out on steam, there a lot coming in.   They are spear-heading the Linux Gaming movement.

Its really a breeze these days.   Graphic card is the only addition work I do.(windows also requires nvidia drivers)    Since nvidia is going for optimus(Hybrid cards) i use the bumblebee package; for other nvidia cards a package from RPM fusion is all it needs.   Fedora 22 pretty much identified everything on its own wifi, camera etc. Hell even my wacom tablet works - plug and play style.    The other fine tuning i do which isn't system level stuff is install vlc, freetype-freeworld(for MacOS like font rendering) and apps like MyPaint, Krita, GIMP and Inkscape for drawing and Blender for 3D.    Have VirtualBox also incase i need a Win environment within Linux for testing and Wine for some stupid windows only apps(which i rarely use these days)    Have another system with Ubuntu and it works great as well :)     Some suggestions:   Do take a look at your router settings, could be a source.   Or check the TCP/IP   DNS settings in Network settings of the system.

APZC development into Firefox should also help the browsing experience.      4 years yes!    ah true thing. i always felt a lag when pipelight runs. Mostly because wine has to load up first.

Can personally confirm that. And it works pretty good too.     For YouTube Center it's better to get the developer edition from github, but you may run into bugs. There's another new one called YouTube plus that works as good as it.     And ensure you have webM disabled in www.youtube.com/html5 or else you'll be subject to choppy performance.    I guess it might have been a mandatory condition to be 'selected'.   Anyway I don't think Mozilla will compromise on cross-platform support.    They are one of the few companies that do cross-platform pretty great. Hoping it comes soon   Here https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2014/05/14/drm-and-the-challenge-of-serving-users/   sorry but i guess all you can do is wait for it now man.  :(    There are more high priority things that people want to see in the release version faster.   You could always write a patch if you can though :)   i think its a system setting, Nautilus also uses the same for navigation.   https://help.gnome.org/users/gnome-help/stable/keyboard-shortcuts-set.html.en    fonts    Consider freetype-freeworld packages or infinality for better rendering.        And if they decide "fuck it. Not worth it" then what? What can Mozilla do them?  Probably court i guess. Things like this might have a legal background.     I understand your frustration. No one with good tech knowledge wanted DRM on the web, but there was no viable alternative at that time too, even now.    Plus one for-good; do-good organization standing up against behemoths of the industry can't win the fight, its quite obvious.    Problem is normal people don't care about ethics and whats good for all as long as it work. They are willing to sacrifice privacy, good-will etc. as long as "it works"    And yea Mozilla still maintain its anti-DRM stance with a non CDM verison of firefox. So up to you as a user to suit your needs.   They dont force you and you still have a choice.       They should, it was the basis of the agreement to implement DRM on firefox    Adobe has to release the CDM on Linux. Mozilla made it mandatory they do so, only a  matter of time.   if you do heavy streaming, games and YouTube, you can empty in no time   Vote for it and wait    Device error? That's strange. What device are you using?    Yeah it's behind In a way compared to chrome, but everything will match up in the next few versions.   It's a people contributed project so things like this take some time.     a last test could be to clear cache from recovery or rebooting into safe mode and coming back to normal mode.

If it's fine, then you'll have to report the issue to the add-on developer.    Also the translucent layout maybe because YouTube is rolling out the new layout or you have activated the TestTube feature.    An alternative addon might be the YouTube Center addon DEV edition.   Also ensure webM is disabled on YouTube.com/html5.       I'd suggest you try the beta incase you're on stable.    Glad that it helped!    Edit - 60fps is supported by MP4 itself    i heard the dev version of Youtube Center is a lot better.   You might want to check into that.    I've not used it personally, but its pretty good for YouTube.  You might run into issue's though since its dev edition.     not now if you want smooth YouTube playback.   It'll be enabled by default once its ready     :)    webM is still under development, so unless you want to take it out on a test drive to find bugs etc. its better to turn it off.   goto about:config and set "media.mediasource.webm.enabled" to false   what all do you have enabled on www.youtube.com/html5 ?

People can hopefully afford the cost bump also.     But bumping up ram to accommodate apps is not the right approach to this problem.    Min requirements for Android or a Linux based desktop environment is 512Mb and I think it should stay as such.    Optimization should be carried on the apps that consume a lot of memory.    More stringent testing and restrictions should be made to ensure apps run on the minimum requirements before being released into the public.     Well... Programs should be designed to run on low memory environment.    There a heck load of junk in a browser that's absolutely unnecessary and nothing is being done to address that.  If a browser and an additional app require the full resource of the ram, then it's not the ram availability that's to be blamed but the program itself.      Maybe because  chrome is the memory hog!   I don't understand the we want more ram deal here much.    512mb was hard on heavy android usage but 1 gig is totally fine.    It's a phone not a desktop computer *_*   Easter egg, :)    I think i wasn't clear.   I'll take the example of moto g here, its perfectly engineered.   Solid build, great plastics, and amazing design. It fits in your palm without any effort and stays there perfect.    Software and battery life is highly optimized because they choose the best components on the market and assemble them.   No heating issue's because again great engineering.   ROM is highly optimized. Goes on for weeks without restarting.   Great call quality(i only find this in moto) and network range. - Decades of experience.    I don't care much from which place a phone is manufactured be it india china etc. I want good quality for the price i pay.    I had the Micromax canvas 2 a110 before, that thing had a massive battery drain, lack of OS updates, build quality was okay when compared to the moto g, touch screen ghost touches when connected to a charger. Also had a visit to the service center to get the touch fixed and had a wonderful(/s) time there.     These problems don't get addressed really well when you rebrand a phone, because you had no say in the manufacturing. You just put a stock rom with bloatware and ship for a good price.    So in-short rebranding is okay, but as a company you will never grow.   And atleast if you are rebranding optimize, optimize and optimize the Software.   Thats the least you could do if you sell a rebranded phone.    EDIT - the cam in the canvas 2 was good though! :)     I'm okay with what they do.   It's just a personal choice that I'll not buy another rebranded product. Would buy the original source itself if I wanted too.    They did capture the market for a long time now and it's time to up the game.     Tag line Nothing like anything, but there is something like it elsewhere XD      i noticed a variation of this but i really cant reproduce it now.   Few days back i had a stable wifi connection but without internet and firing up Nightly41 would take sooooo loooong for the window to show up.     Micromax has NO engineering.    If it was their company introduction products this approach was fine. Since it's been a looooooong time they've been In the market, they better start doing some shit of their own instead of rebranding stuff.

 Can you link it for me? I can't seem to find it.   It sounds like chaos because the timing is off and the brain can't find a "groove" to settle into. Take a look at what /u/Poobslag commented above. The chord changes are jarring and seem out of time with the song.    Tapered is your answer. No one's calves are bigger than their thighs.   Standard tapered have significant'y more thigh room than slims. I went with a standard tapered because I normally can't wear slim pants (511 is a sausage-thigh fit) and I normally wear normal tapers but I definitely could have gone with a slim tapered. Think of slim as the standard, skinny as the slim, and standard as the "plus".  I will say the standard still has a nice taper to them. They won't look like dad pants.    Some leather conditioner might help.    [Navali bags](http://www.navali.com/bags/boatswain-messenger-bag.html?product=anchor639) are pretty nice. And they're on sale right now!   You should wear light, pastel colors.   If you want to really go in depth, check out [this](http://www.wikihow.com/Choose-Colors-That-Flatter-Skin-Tone) guide to determining your skin tone. Once you've found it, search your skin tone + color chart to find a palate of colors that work well with your specific skin tone.   Note that these aren't set rules! If you find a color that doesn't match your skin tone but you think still looks good on you, rock it! And what color your clothes are relative to you matters very little. What's much more important is your clothes' color relative to each other.   As for what clothes you should wear, check out the side bar's Getting Started Guide and hang around on this sub.   Good luck!   I know charcoal colored gets thrown around here a lot but I already have one of those (J. Crew University coat, which I love) and I'm looking to expand my coat selection during the coming end-of-season sales. I am looking for a light, heather gray wool coat.  I love the design and color of [this Zara](http://www.zara.com/us/en/sale/man/coats-and-trench-coats/coats/double-faced-coat-c541817p2161054.html) coat but I have heard bad things about Zara and the quality at this price point. I would rather have something that will last me a while. Is there anything with a similar design? Or should I just go for this one?  I also like the [Schott Car Coat in Heather Gray](https://www.schottnyc.com/products/wool-car-coat.htm) but my size is already sold out.   The [J. Crew Skiff Jacket](https://www.jcrew.com/AST/Navigation/Sale/AllProducts/PRD~A9716/A9716.jsp?Nbrd=J Nloc=en_US Nrpp=48 Npge=1 Ntrm=skiff isSaleItem=true color_name=CHARCOAL isFromSearch=true isNewSearch=true hash=row0) is also nice but doesn't come in the light gray color I want.  Do you know of any coats that fit my description?    It's called flaring, and there isn't too much you can do about it. I'd return it if you still can. Ironing may also help.    All this is sound advice, but if he is unmotivated to do any of this with you, there is very little you can do to persuade him otherwise. Some people just don't care about clothing or fashion at all, and no amount of guidance or conversation will be able to change that. If you try all of this and he STILL doesn't want to do it, please don't try to force it or make ultimatums or anything like that, for the sake of your relationship. Just accept that he really doesn't care and drop the issue.   I really hope everything works out! Good luck!   Don't worry about having the "normal" amount of pants. Even if you had 500 pairs, if you had a use for and are happy with owning all of them, it's okay.    I used to do the same thing as you when I was first starting out and buying my basic items. Now that I have a good enough wardrobe my shopping experience is a little different. There are a few items that I am looking at purchasing/upgrading to add to my wardrobe (parka, dress shoes) that I am slowly researching and taking my time on purchasing. When I go to stores I take a look at these items but also "impulse buy" anything that I like that is on sale (ie. might not be there when I come back) at stores that have good return policies. I then sit on it for a while and really consider whether I will really use an item or not. Most often I end up returning the item. If what I like is not on sale I'll add it to my list of things to research more. This gives me the "shopping fix" without wasting any money.  I view shopping as more of a journey than a destination spot. I have more than enough basics that I don't have to make trips to buy specific things anymore - instead, I shop to see new clothes that maybe aren't exactly in line with my current style or something I wouldn't necessarily think of wearing. Maybe I will be inspired to try something new.   A total of zero of my friends care about dressing well, and they view shopping as a chore and only go when they absolutely need something, and try to be in and out as fast as possible. They make fun of me for going every week and coming back with nothing. But I don't care. To me it's an experience that helps me develop my personal style.   Plus going by myself gets me away from my asshole friends.   TL;DR: what you're doing is fine and better than what most people do.    I think the most important thing about a fragrance is whether you like it or not. If you don't like it, you won't be confident when you wear it, and confidence is everything.    I would save up an extra $50 or so and get a pair of Meermins.    Uniqlo heattech is deep enough that two buttons undone won't show. I have yet to try to airisms.    Stretch might not be the right word to use... A wool coat will "soften" up over time, conform to your body shape and become much more comfortable to wear after a little while.   I definitely think there is such a thing as "breaking in" a wool coat. If the fit is fine, just give it a little time to relax and form to you.    if   Honestly I think Ross's cologne prices aren't anything spectacular. You can buy the same things on Amazon for about the same/even less.   Watch the clearance section for reasonable deals. I picked up some Calvin Klein Euphoria that I really like.    Perry Ellis 360 Red is the one that smells like Aqua di Gio. Personally I think Perry Ellis 360 smells absolutely disgusting. It made me so nauseous I had to wash it off.   It doesn't look like she's eaten anything before.    So soaking in vinegar does nothing? Is there anything else I can do?    If I don't want my new raws to get super siq faydes what should I do? I've heard a cold water, salt, and vinegar soak helps lock in more dye. I've heard woolite dark helps.   What size should I get if I wear 8.5s-9s?   I have the same problem and Uniqlo's cut was really bad for me. I have found J. Crew's slim shirts to fit very well off the rack.   If I don't want my new raws to get super siq faydes, what should I do? I've heard a cold water, salt, and vinegar soak helps lock in more dye.   As much as I hate to circle-jerk, Uniqlo's stuff fits your body type very well. Other brands that I find fit well are J. Crew and American Eagle.   Source: am thin, tall Asian.   Just get both and try them on, they have free returns.    I just called my store and they told me they weren't doing the extra 50% off winter items and denim :( Oh well, it's still a great price!   Unfortunately my local store doesn't carry Unbranded :( Do you think they would still take the 50% off?      Looks too small and tight. It looks like an undershirt right now.   Tanks should be a little loose and billowy. You're supposed to be letting the air flow through to keep you cool. [This](http://www.randysreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/bro-tank.jpg) is how I think they should fit to look okay. Notice that the chest is not skin tight, as it is right now.    What is normally included in these grab bags?    I am looking to be an investment manager, the interview will be at Morgan Stanley. Still think it will be okay?   Would a dark brown perforated cap toe shoe be too casual for an interview? Should I do a non-perforated cap toe instead?   And free!   Uniq-  Oh, you said boxers, not boxer briefs.   But still, most likely Uniqlo.   Also, these "mature" clothes mentioned above will look "young/fresh" if they fit well and are cut in a modern style. That way you can still look grown-up while still keeping a fresh look.  This is the game I play constantly in college.    I got sent another one of these codes today and noticed that it was the same one I received yesterday. I tried it and the code worked! I would try using your codes again and seeing if they reset overnight.    J. Crew's 770 fit is very similar.   Get a suede brush (or use a firm toothbrush) and brush the shoes to restore the nap. Be sure to brush in one direction, like you're brushing a pet.    Nice, picked up a pair of used Chippewa's for $58.18. Got lucky!   Warby Parker  edit: oh crap you said not expensive... yeah I have no clue. Sorry :(   Your hair is the perfect type to do something like that in the picture. There is about no way to get your hair to look like that without using product, at least at first, so don't worry about how your hair grows at the roots. You will be able to style it like that.   In regards to clothes, just read the sidebar and hang around on this sub. Go thrifting and experiment with clothing. Remember, fit is king. Slowly but surely your style will develop and you will start looking the way you want to.    J. Crew has a similar fit with a longer body length.    Not a big fan of J. Crew Factory personally. I'd say Uniqlo has the edge quality-wise, but J. Crew's fits just work better for me.    I just called and they didn't let me :(    I'd check out Warby Parker, they have plenty of glasses that would match pretty well.   	47

It appears that Anglo-Saxon children wore clothes similar to the adults. Boys would wear trousers with a tunic and a belt at the waist, like men. Girls may have just worn a long tunic dress but some girls also appear to have worn the over-dress held together with a pair of brooches at the shoulders and a belt at the waist.

His father had only taken the assignment in Bloemfontein because the English bank for which he worked had promised him a promotion for going there. Certainly Tolkien never considered himself to be a South African, just an Englishman who happened to be born in South Africa. He never returned.

 It's complicated. There is validity to the perspective that it is wrong to take a kid out of the custody of a parent over a parent's choice to not select a certain medical treatment, and that it's wrong to force a 17-y-o to undergo a medical treatment. In a year, she could have said no and nobody could force her otherwise, so why does that year make a difference?  On the other hand, would we allow a seventeen year old with a non-terminal illness to make the decision to kill herself? Would we intervene if her mother was planning to let her kill herself? Would we intervene to forcibly prevent a seventeen year old from killing herself?  Both perspectives apply to Cassandra's situation. Chemotherapy is awful, it's painful, it has terrible side effects, it is intentionally putting poison into one's body. But Hodgkin's Lymphoma, if treated with chemotherapy, is curable at rates of 85%. And once the terribleness of chemo is over, one goes on to live a good, full life.  We wouldn't force an adult to undergo medical treatment, even when failing to do so would kill them. Doing so to someone who is so close to being an adult is disturbing.  But we also don't allow kids to kill themselves. Allowing a 17-year-old to die from cancer instead of undergoing a temporarily awful treatment with an 85% chance of saving her life is also disturbing.  I don't have a great answer. If it was me, I'd take the chemo. If it was my kid, I'd force her to take the chemo. And if I was the kid's doctor, I'd do everything in my power to legally save my patient's lifeI don't blame the docs or the State in this. There's no great, obvious winning answer here.   The wireless service contract that was screwed up was a cell phone wireless service contractit was a contract to provide cell service throughout the metro system, including in underground tunnels and stations.  Currently, many (most?) stations have cell service at the platform, but the signal drops to nothingness once the train moves away from the platform. That is the case at L'Enfant Plaza-there is cell service on the station and for a short distance beyond it, then there's no signal until one gets above ground at the 14th street bridge (and signal then drops to nothingness once one goes below ground until one gets to the Pentagon station).  We were lucky that the train stopped close enough to the platform for the firefighters to still have cell phone coverage. Another five or ten seconds of train travel time and that wouldn't have been the case.   Utterly unacceptable. And we should count ourselves lucky that the train was disabled close enough to the L'Enfant Plaza station for cell phones to work.  Under a federal funding deal in 2008, wireless service was required to be available throughout the Metro system by December 2012. Metro blew the deadline, and said it would take until December 2015. Then the contractor filed for bankruptcy and sought to get out of the contract. That's the last I heard, so, best case scenario is 12 more months, and I sure wouldn't be betting on that.  And cell service is what firefighters had to rely on for outside communications. One more example of Metro's "culture of safety".      My best wishes to him-I hope he feels well soon. I'm sure it must have been a terrifying experience.   The roads were fine, but the sidewalks were icy in places, and since many of the folks who metro to work walk to and from metro stations, this seems like a decent call by OPM.   I thought I could. Oops.   I agree with Troll_McLure's suggested remedy. As for your question "what is this", my guess is that it is corrupted files somewhere along the lines that are no longer recognized as what they were (books, music, movies, etc.) so they are stuck on the device in an unreadable form and are not deleted when you make changes to settings (because they are not being recognized).   Are you this rude to everyone, Gahgeer?  A crime is a crime. There is no carveout for war crimes or exceptional crimes or this-is-really-bad crimes.   Moreover, in 1995, there had already been no shortage of allegations of war crimes levied by Palestinians against Israelis and by Israelis against Palestinians. Events like the Sabra and Shatila massacres on one side, and the first intifada on the other side (to give one example each-clearly one could spend paragraphs and paragraphs for either side), were on the minds of all parties. A crime is a crime, and the Oslo Accords give Israel jurisdiction over all criminal offenses in the Territory, be it petty or grand, but it is not accidental that this delegation of jurisdiction includes war crimes-it was intentional.    Under the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court, the ICC's jurisdiction is based on delegationmembers of the ICC delegate part of their jurisdiction to the ICC. The Oslo Accords preclude such a delegation on the part of Palestine. Oslo II (Annex II of the 1995 agreement) Article I limits Palestinian criminal jurisdiction to "offenses committed by Palestinians and/or non-Israelis in the Territory", with "territory" referring  to the Gaza Strip, the West Bank, and theoretically, East Jerusalem. Under the Oslo Accords, Israel has exclusive criminal jurisdiction over offenses committed by Israelis in Gaza and the West Bank.  Seeking to delegate criminal jurisdiction over alleged Israeli crimes to the ICC, therefore, is a breach of the Oslo Accords. (EDIT: AKA the Palestinian Authority is seeking to delegate to the ICC jurisdiction that it exclusively gave to Israel under the Oslo Accords.)  Which isn't to say that both sides haven't breached various portions of the Oslo Accords numerous times, but neither side have formally backed out of the Accords either. And so given the Palestinian Authority's most recent breach of the Accords (trying to join the ICC), Israel's suspension of one of its commitments under the Accords (collecting and transferring tax revenue to the PA) seems a proportional response.   It is worth noting that Israel collects the tax money and distributes it to the Palestinian Authority under the Oslo Accords. As part of the Oslo Accords, the PA agreed to not seek to use the ICC as a forum for charges against Israel. It's a proportional response.   No Child Left Behind (NCLB) is mostly a red herring. The Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) has been around since 1965. It has been reauthorized many times since, with various changes and tweaks with each reauthorization. NCLB was the most recent reauthorization of the ESEA, done in 2001. NCLB added various high-stakes testing provisions, accountability provisions, etc., which have been controversial. But the proposed changes aren't looking to do away with just the NCLB provisions-they are seeking to remove most Federal oversight of, and requirements for, Federal education funds.  Traditionally under the ESEA, even before NCLB, there were many strings attached to Federal education funds. Title I funds, intended to help compensate for poor schools and poor school districts, had to be used for Title I schoolsa district with a range of schools, some Title I, some not, couldn't receive Title I funds and apply it to the non-Title I schools. You can't use Federal funds intended to help students to instead buy watches for principals as a reward for a job well done. Or a break room refrigerator. Or cars for personal use. You can't receive IDEA funds intended to benefit special education students to instead buy desks for all students. Etc.  AND, and this is a big restriction, for most Federal education grants, states must use Federal funds to supplement state education funds, not supplant. This means that one cannot get $20 million dollars from the Federal government in grant X and use it reduce the amount the state puts into education by $20 million. That $20 million dollars must be used to supplement existing education funding, not be a substitute for state funds.  Some don't like these restrictions, and want to be able to use Federal funds as they see fit. People calling for the elimination of the U.S. Department of Education or a reduced role of the Federal government in education are not usually calling for the elimination or reduction of the money the Federal government gives to states for education. Instead, they are calling for the strings to be cutfor states to get a big pot of money (AKA block grant) that they can do whatever they want withthat they can treat the same way they treat their own general (state and local) funds, be it buying principals watches or supplanting state funds.  The TL;DR version is that people aren't arguing for a reduction of Federal money going to education, they are arguing that states should have no restrictions on how the money can be spent.   Nope, I'm afraid not. You are confusing the Preamble of the Constitution with Article I, Section 8. What the Court said in Jacobson was that the preamble was a statement of purpose and not a source of substantive power. Article I, Section 8 of the Constitution, however, gives Congress the authority to "pay the debts and provide for the common defense and general welfare of the United States". That IS a source of substantive power-it's the body of the Constitution as opposed to the preamble.   It's all state specific, but the most common rule is something along the lines of DR 7-105(a) of the ABA's Model Code of Professional Responsibility: "A lawyer shall not present, participate in presenting, or threaten to present criminal charges solely to obtain an advantage in a civil matter."  As I understand it, Dershowitz is not currently a party to the civil proceeding in question-I believe the allegation was in papers related to a civil suit against Jeffrey Epstein. EDIT: He's also not a lawyer in that civil proceeding.   You may want to consider contacting an employment law lawyer in your jurisdiction. You may have options under Federal, state, or local law, and even if you don't want to sue, you should at least know your rights. See http://www.goulddcemploymentlaw.com/Lawyers-Dos-and-donts.shtml for info on that process.

Are you sure you shouldn't work in marketing? http://dilbert.com/strips/comic/1997-04-27/   This is the first step to Congressional Republicans turning the country into Kansas. Since Kansas, under the leadership of Governor Brownback, cut taxes for the rich and raised taxes on the poor in the name of encouraging economic growth, Kansas has been creating jobs far slower than its peer states and its tax revenues have plummeted, leaving the state with large revenue shortfalls.  Congressional Republicans want to institute similar tax policies. Their problem (besides these policies not working in practice) is that the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), the office tasked with determining the predicted economic impact of a bill (AKA scoring a bill) uses reality-based economics to predict whether a bill (be it tax cuts, spending, etc.) will cause revenue to go up, go down, etc. and by how much. Using reality-based scoring, Republicans' economic plans seem unfeasible. The GOP's solution is to fire the head of the CBO and replace him with someone who will go along with their plan to use dynamic scoringa form of scoring a bill that assumes that tax cuts magically kickstart the economy and that tax increases magically damage the economy. AKA using the assumptions that have failed in practice so badly in Kansas.  This is but one more example of the party that believes that government does not work doing everything in its power to ensure that it is right.   My compliments to the baker!

It's not the grand jury's role to consider defenses, and its not the prosecutor's role or obligation to present facts harmful to the prosecution.   In U.S. v. Williams, 504 U.S. 36 (1992), Justice Scalia's majority opinion stated, "According to the description of an early American court, three years before the Fifth Amendment was ratified, it is the grand jury's function not "to enquire . . . upon what foundation [the charge may be] denied," or otherwise to try the suspect's defenses, but only to examine "upon what foundation [the charge] is made" by the prosecutor... As a consequence, neither in this country nor in England has the suspect under investigation by the grand jury ever been thought to have a right to testify, or to have exculpatory evidence presented..."

If you're aware that someone is vegan and you feed them cheese ravioli or pasta with eggs, that's wrong. If you're aware someone keeps kosher or halal, you don't slip them a ham and cheese sandwich. And if you're aware that someone does not eat deer and you feed them venison without their knowledge, that's wrong. Doesn't matter if someone doesn't eat X because of moral reasons, health reasons, religious reasons, or ridiculous reasons. You don't slip someone something you know they have said they don't eat, nor do you not say something if you think they are about to accidentally eat such a thing. Consent matters.   Eyewitness testimony is unreliable (not that all evidence doesn't potentially have issueseven DNA evidence can be intentionally or negligently/accidentally compromised), but that doesn't account for a prosecutor not asking for the full story. Had the prosecutor wanted an indictment, he would have met with David Corn (or at least spoke with him over the phone) beforehand. Nobody trying for an indictment against a police officer just puts a witness on the stand without hearing the story firsthand. And had the prosecutor wanted an indictment, he would have gotten the full story out on the stand.   I don't mean to besmirch engineers-merely pointing out that developers hire engineers and architects and other professionals who are supposed to be able to deal with challenges like an existing highway.

Engineers like engineering challenges because they like engineering. They like to figure out how to do things.

The move he used was first restricted to cases where officers' safety was at risk in 1985 because of the risk it could kill someone. In 1993, it was banned entirely because it could kill someone. It's 2014, a cop used the move, and it killed someone. It's pretty darn simple.   It's worth pointing to this NYT article from 1993 when the NYPD banned the use of chokeholds in all circumstances because of its potential lethality: http://www.nytimes.com/1993/11/24/nyregion/kelly-bans-choke-holds-by-officers.html  Moreover, it's worth noting that the NYPD's ban of chokeholds goes back to 1985, when an order from then-police commissioner Raymond Kelly stated, "choke holds, which are potentially lethal and unnecessary, will not be routinely used", and only permitted their use when an officer's life was in danger and the chokehold was the "least dangerous alternative method of restraint". The 1993 order took away that exceptionno chokeholds because of the unreasonable risk of lethality.     Vitriol? Seems that we've moved from a thin-skull to thin-skin. I don't believe I attacked you in any way.  And sorry, this is fairly clear-cut, or rather, should have been clear-cut enough to get an indictment. The complexity of the law, the facts beyond the video tape, etc., that would and should have come into play at a trial, but there was more than enough to indict.  There are plenty of rules that when violated don't automatically turn a cop into a criminal. This isn't one of themchokeholds were banned for a reason.   The chokehold was banned for a reasonbecause it could lead to the exact result that happened here. I don't see how a factfinder could hold that it was proportional to use a potentially deadly maneuver against a person who was not posing a far more significant threat than Mr. Garner was.   It can apply to criminal negligence, and the general concept behind the doctrine, that one is responsible for what happened and not for what one might have reasonably expected to happen, is in place in criminal law. Same idea, different terminology, sure. It doesn't necessarily fit with a 1st degree murder/1st degree manslaughter statute or other statutes requiring mens rea.   YesPolice had an absolute right to use reasonable force. Reasonable. The chokehold was banned by the police department BECAUSE it could kill someone in exactly the manner in which Eric Garner died.  It cannot be reasonable force for a police officer to use a move that was banned by one's own department for imposing too high a risk of death or injury.   It certainly isn't on the decline internationally. Still happens domestically too. Attacks on Jews in EuropeFrance, England, Belgium, occur regularly. As of the time I'm typing this, two of the top stories on the Jerusalem Post's website are about anti-Semitic attacks: a Yeshiva student was badly beaten in Moscow and a Jewish couple in France was robbed, the wife raped, with one of the attackers telling them "Tell us where you hide the money,' ...You Jews always have money." http://www.jpost.com/Diaspora/Paris-attackers-during-Jewish-womans-rape-robbery-Where-is-the-money-You-Jews-always-have-money-383525 and http://www.jpost.com/Diaspora/Yeshiva-student-badly-beaten-in-Moscow-383562  There was a pogrom in the United States in New York City in 1991, in which one of my family friend's cousin, Yankel, was murdered in Crown Heights because he was Jewish. en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crown_Heights_riot  A few weeks ago, a Jewish teen in Paris was beaten by 15 assailants. http://www.timesofisrael.com/jewish-teen-attacked-in-paris-after-arson-attempt-at-kosher-eatery/ 12 hours earlier in an unrelated case, someone tried to burn down a kosher restaurant.  Two weeks ago in Arizona, 15 members of fraternity SAE attacked members of the Jewish fraternity, Alpha Epsilon Pi, while shouting discriminatory comments at them. http://tucson.com/news/local/education/college/ua-suspends-frat-after-jewish-fraternity-attacked/article_bb039dd6-6eaf-11e4-9fd6-cf99daaa8b3f.html  Last month, a four-year-old in New Zealand was attacked while he was on his way home from school because he was wearing a kippah. http://www.timesofisrael.com/jewish-preschooler-attacked-in-new-zealand/  How many people have to be attacked for antisemitism to still be deemed to exist?   The eggshell plaintiff we all learned about in torts class applied here. Yes, Garner had health issues that contributed to his death and so yes, the chokehold at issue wouldn't have killed just anyone. But all that matters is that it did kill Eric Garner. A person whose alleged crime was selling loose cigarettes to adults on the sidewalk. That's abhorrent, that's illegal, and that should have led to an indictment of the officer.   I would suggest not thinking of it in black and white terms, but rather as akin to Schrodinger's cat being both dead and alive until its observed.   Until its tested, it is unclear if making reasonable modifications to dishes for people with disabilities is required under the ADA. But that it is unclear does not mean that restaurants are under no obligation to do it. Tomorrow, a decision could come out in a circuit affirming that reasonable modifications are mandated by the ADA, and it would not mean that from that day forward, restaurants in that circuit would have to make modifications. It would mean that restaurants should have been doing so all along, and anyone who was denied a reasonable accomodation in that circuit within the statute of limitations (arguably either the state's personal injury statute of limitations or the 4 year federal statute of limitationsthe actual timeframe can be complicated and not relevant here) can sue and have a decent shot at winning.  Court precedents are not like legislation. Congress passes a bill requiring people to wear purple on Thursdays, the President signs it into law, but it has to be prospectivepeople can't get into trouble if they didn't wear purple on Thursdays before the law was enacted. Court decisions are differentthey aren't making law, they're a declaration of the law is and has been. A court decision saying that people were supposed to wear purple on Thursdays can apply to people who failed to wear purple before the decision came out.   But you're ignoring the very next item on that website:   "What might a restaurant or other similar place of public accommodation need to do to accommodate an individual with celiac disease or other food allergies?  A: A restaurant may have to take some reasonable steps to accommodate individuals with disabilities where it does not result in a fundamental alteration of that restaurant's operations. By way of example only, this may include: 1) answering questions from diners about menu item ingredients, where the ingredients are known, or 2) omitting or substituting certain ingredients upon request if the restaurant normally does this for other customers."  Restaurants are not required to serve gluten-free or allergen-free food, but if they can make reasonable substitutions or modifications, they may be required to do so.   True-but you'd be surprised the number of well-meaning people who hear my Mom say she's allergic to dairy and suggest Lactaid.   And airplanes. Fair housing and airplanes are the two places where there are separate Federal statutes that cover emotional support animals.   My mom's milk allergy definitely extends to butter. I'm not sure she's tried clarified butter, but given how sick dairy makes her feel, I don't think she's willing to try it either. (And sadly lactaid doesn't do a great deal to help.)   Absolutely-I'm with you 100%. Hell, even if it is a "stupid fad diet" and not an allergy, the card is absurdly vague.   Yep. True. (For those not as well versed in the ADA as you, it's worth noting that dogs can be trained to assist with emotional/psychological needs, making them service dogs, but they have to be trained for a task. It is not enough that they provide comfort.)   I appreciate your comment at the end. :-) I'll confess I was feeling personally attacked until I read to the end. :P  I think there is a distinction that can be drawn between the university and restaurant settings, but I do disagree that the government would never use the ADA to force accommodations of allergies. Never is a very long time...   Indeed! It's unsettled law (unsettled pretty much equals untested), but my best guess is that a court wouldn't hold that a chef should have created a special, unique dish. Requiring reasonable modifications, like oil instead of butter, or swapping out a side, etc., that may be compelled by the ADA, but not modifications that require a whole new dish.   You can't. Not without entering the litigation stage, which is something one doesn't want to do. As /u/skivian noted, its an issue with more than just allergies. In other ADA contexts, like the work or school environments,  they can make reasonable demands for documentation (with reasonable being a huge caveat there), but in the public accommodation sphere, it is difficult to ask for documentation without the request/demand itself being a violation of the ADA.   Oh, and here's a link to the Lesley settlement agreement: http://www.ada.gov/lesley_university_sa.htm  EDIT: The Q A may be useful too: http://www.ada.gov/q a_lesley_university.htm  Note questions 5 and 6:   Five. What might a restaurant or other similar place of public accommodation need to do to accommodate an individual with celiac disease or other food allergies?  A: A restaurant may have to take some reasonable steps to accommodate individuals with disabilities where it does not result in a fundamental alteration of that restaurant's operations. By way of example only, this may include: 1) answering questions from diners about menu item ingredients, where the ingredients are known, or 2) omitting or substituting certain ingredients upon request if the restaurant normally does this for other customers.  Six. What is a fundamental alteration? A: A fundamental alteration is a modification that is so significant that it alters the essential nature of the good or services that a business offers. For example, a restaurant is not required to alter its menu or provide different foods to meet particular dietary needs"  (sorry I couldn't figure out Reddit formatting to make this a block quote)   Well, one recent settlement agreement was negotiated between the Department of Justice and Lesley University in Boston. The DOJ alleged that Lesley failed to make reasonable accommodations that would allow people with celiac disease and food allergies to "fully and equally enjoy the privileges, advantages, and accommodations of its food service and meal plan system." This was a voluntary agreement, not a court decision, but the agreement says in part, "Food allergies may constitute a disability under the ADA, 42 U.S.C.  12102. Individuals with food allergies may have an autoimmune response to certain foods, the symptoms of which may include difficulty swallowing and breathing, asthma, and anaphylaxis."  There is a difference between a restaurant and a universitythe university setting often imposes the cost of meal plans on students (as opposed to the choice of going to a restaurant or not), so there is somewhat of a special setting involved. But, both restaurants and institutes of higher learning are places of public accommodation within the definition and scope of the ADA. As I said, I'm not aware of a lawsuit against a restaurant over not accommodating a request under the ADA, but I'd be shocked if one didn't rise to public attention in the next decade. (It takes a long time to get to a circuit court, which is probably what's needed to really hit the newsdistrict court decisions, settlements, etc. seldom hit the big time.)   This may be an unpopular response. I know things like this makes life really difficult for chefs, and that there is a point where the kitchen may want to just tell a person no. (And I agree with /u/LittleOrangeCat that it seems odd they did not specify what the food allergens are).  That said, its worth noting that allergies can be a protected disability under the Americans with Disabilities Act. I am unaware of any caselaw on food allergy issues in restaurants specifically, but cases are trickling through the courts on how the ADA as amended in '08 applies to people with food allergies. Generally, post the 2008 amendments, people with food allergies of a certain severity have been found to be disabled for the purpose of the statute, and so failing to make reasonable accommodations for a person with food allergies may be actionable.  Of course, step two is what is a reasonable accommodation? Not every restaurant is going to have the ability to accommodate every food allergy. In this case, if this person meant "new pan", "new spatula", etc. to be a NEW pan, spatula, etc. instead of a CLEAN pan, spatula, etc., that may stretch the definition of reasonable in reasonable accommodation to its breaking point. If they were only asking for extra caution in ensuring no cross-contamination by making sure things were clean, not using dairy/eggs, etc., that might be considered reasonable in a court of law.  Just a point to bear in mind, and I'll otherwise return to lurking, as I'm interested in the food service industry but not a member and I don't want to step on anyone's toes. :)   I suspect this was an artless attempt to warn police departments of the sovereign citizen movement.   This won't prepare you for culinary school, but if you're looking for an easy, educational cookbook with recipes that are intended to be made there and now (as opposed to a multiday process), I recommend Elaine Cook's "Now You're Cooking: Everything a Beginner Needs to Know to Start Cooking Today." It's out of print, but you can get a used copy off Amazon for a penny plus the $3.99 to ship it. It's well laid out, teaches techniques, and doesn't call for fancy equipment.   It may have to do with the economies of scale. Of the $3,300 a franchised BK makes per day, veggie burgers are a drop in the bucket. It's great that they offer them, and hopefully others follow suit.    Food trucks are definitely less common in the rain, because so many less people go out to the trucks when its raining.  There are less trucks in the winter (the ice cream and fro yo trucks usually take the winter off), but not significantly so.   I don't believe Sine in Pentagon Row cards if one isn't drinkingtrivia is on Sundays at 7.   I am not a troll, this is a legitimate questionwhat is the advantage of a streetcar over a bus if it doesn't have a dedicated lane? It doesn't go any faster than a bus would...   The Palestinians are claiming Israelis killed him. They are not, however, claiming there is any evidence of this.   Thanks for the suggestion! I don't have one of those, I have a gas stove. That might be my next best bet, but if possible, I'd like to find a way of making it work with my stove since I have so little counterspace. *rueful look*   Hi all. Over the weekend, I bought a korean-style indoor bbq plate/ringthe kind that sort of looks like a hubcap on top of a ring that catches drippings and can hold liquid to steam things/stop things from smoking.  The instructions say that if it does not fit on a gas stove  grate, one can take off the grate and put a cooling rack there instead. I bought a small cooling rack, put the bbq device on top, but when I cooked with it, it started glowing red and deforming (aka slowly melting, pretty much). Not its fault-it clearly wasn't meant for that-but I'm wondering what to use as a substitute?  Are there other cooling racks that are high heat-safe? Would a wok ring do the trick? What am I looking for?   Except in this instance, Abbas is deeming any Jew who wants to pray on the Temple Mount an extremist. That's a little different from settlers or Kahanists.   This is no different than Legoland, which also prohibits adults without children from coming to their parks.   I urge you to ignore people who tell you take a class because it will be on the bar. For one thing, that sort of thing is state-specific and depends on what bar you take! And more importantly, you can learn anything you need to for the bar from a bar prep course. Don't waste a class on something that you aren't interested in and don't think will help you in practice or in the job hunt. If you're interested in, say, Trusts and Estates, then yestake Trusts and Estates. If you think you might want to go into private practice in Family Law, or in General Practice, then yestake Trusts and Estates. If the only reason you're considering taking it is because it's on the bar, DON'T. Classes are preciouspick good ones.  Moving beyond the impromptu PSA to your question, like all classes, Admin law can be made awesome or terrible by a professor, but it is a very useful class. I wholeheartedly agree with /u/shanedoth and others who said it is the second-most useful substantive class after evidence. It touches upon nearly every other area of law. Personal injury lawyer whose client hit/was hit by on-duty Federal employee? Admin law! Food and drug law? Admin law! Environmental law? Admin law! Consumer product safety? Admin law! The list goes on and on.   Great Big Sea's "The Mermaid": https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mp725C0_qyQ   Really nice costumes. :-)   No, only Israel will be forced to give up their own security and sovereignty. Nobody pays attention to the Egyptian border.   You can get an estimated cost via the app. If the estimated cost was vastly different from the actual cost, yeah, I'd be right there with the outraged people raging at surge pricing. But if you didn't check to see what the cost was looking like, that's on you.   Yes-the Uber driver makes more money. The stated goal of surge pricing is to incentivize  more drivers to be out driving in times of peak demand.   Does this mean Chief Lanier will be shutting down the Verizon Center for the next 96 hours? /s   I'm not suggesting that you should or shouldn't believe the IDF's claims. Just that you can't judge the situation by the JPost's picture accompanying the article. The picture is not actually related to the story.   You're right. The picture is of a little kid showing a little rock. The photo is not from the event in question. Read the caption.   The picture is NOT of the Palestinian allegedly hurling a firebomb. Read the caption.   The picture is NOT of the Palestinian allegedly hurling a firebomb. Read the caption.   My goodness, that jackass is insane.   The menu looks delicious. Thanks for the recommendation!   Oh, cool! Thanks! :)   Thank you. :-)   I will be relying on a taxi/uber, most likely. (And thanks again.)   Hi all. My apologies if this has been answered here before, I tried looking at some of the sidebar links but they don't seem necessarily current, and I'm honestly not sure where the airport Best Western is compared to the things listed. (Hotel is on Airport Commerce Drive.)  I'm a pescetarian, so, fish and vegetarian options are what I'm looking for, as opposed to steak-only sort of places, and I'll be there for two days next week. Thanks!      I am running the most updated iTunes, Yosemite, and iOS 8.0.2. In iTunes, I have checked sync all Podcasts, but nothing is syncing. For some podcasts, it is up to date as far as the episodes I have, but instead of actually being on my iPhone, it's in the undownloaded formI can click the cloud button to get them. For other podcasts, it's not current-it's listing older episodes I have long since listened to and deleted.  I have tried unchecking sync podcasts, syncing, and then rechecking it and syncing. I even reinstalled the OS and then restored files from a backup.  So far, no luck. Any thoughts?   Unfortunately, I cannot recommend it. As others have noted, the 2011 MBPs had GPU issues. I loved my 17" MBP, and after 3 weeks, the screen size of the 15" rMBP I replaced it with still feels tiny, but it's just not worth spending $1k on a 3 year old computer that could die at any minute.  And I will admit that while I deeply wish Apple still offered 17" screens, the quality of the retina screen isn't just marketingI continue to marvel at the clarity and sharpness of it, whether I'm watching a low-res Youtube video, a high def Netflix stream, or even just surfing the web.   I didn't see someone for my hip, but I really liked the two docs I saw at OrthoBethesda for my back and shoulder. http://www.orthobethesda.com/about/doctorbiographies.aspx   http://scendan.livejournal.com/586135.html   He's a great author but not a great person. His treatment of Connie Willis was particularly distressing.   They stopped a black person because he was black. That's racism. It's all the more inexcusable given that they were responding to a burglary alarm as opposed to a report of a burglary. The statistics I've seen have said that 94-99% of all burglar alarm calls to police are false. So with minimal reason to believe that a burglary took place, and with no individual suspicion of the gentleman beyond the color of his skin and that he was carrying bags, police stopped him.   Yes, an UberX driver attacked a customer last week. Should I start listing incidents in which taxi drivers have attacked or sexually assaulted customers? There's no shortage of those incidents either, but they are generally isolated incidents on both sides.   Pretty much this... Until recently (I think behavior is somewhat changing due to Uber), even when my friends or I called and asked for a cab with a credit card reader, 75% of the times we'd be told that it was out of order, and do we need him (always a him...) to stop at an ATM.  When out and about with a friend who is blind, I'd see her try to hail and cab and nobody would stop. I'd try and get a cab in 30 seconds or less.  And 20% of the time when I was trying to get from downtown to Bethesda, I'd be told to get out of the cab or cab drivers would try to convince me to pay a flat rate that would be $10 higher than what the meter would be.  Uber is popular because cabs suck, and the DC Taxicab Commission has historically allowed cabs to suck. I'm not shocked that 84 of 308 potential customers were refused cab ridesI'm shocked that the DC Taxi Commission conducted such a study and I'm shocked that they released such a study.   Crap like this is why I prefer to take Uber.      The ban on Jews going to/praying at the temple rock is entirely an appeasement to terrorism. To this day, a large portion of the Arab world argues that the Second Intifada was justified, or at the least, provoked, by Ariel Sharon visiting the Temple Mount, despite Sharon going during normal tourist hours and not going into the Al-Aqsa Mosque.   Mine too! It was totally a Dr. Strangelove moment.   For a real-life courtroom drama book, I'd suggest Deborah Lipstadt's "History on Trial: My Day in Court With a Holocaust Denier."   There is a downloadable $70 student version of Windows 8.1 available from Microsoft, but be warned that to actually download it, you'll need access to a Windows machine because the thing you initially download is a 6MB exe app to do the download. (It can be frustrating as mac users to need Windows to download Windows.)   Don't think of it as a "traffic ticket", think of it as a criminal charge and respond appropriately by getting a lawyer. In most jurisdictions, fighting a traffic ticket is about trying to reduce or eliminate the amount of the fine. In Virginia, fighting a traffic ticket can be about trying to reduce or eliminate the amount of time spent in jailit's not something I'd want to handle on my own.   I loved Administrative Law. I think it's definitely a course that is made or broken by the professor, more so than most, given the unsettled and shifting nature of the caselaw.  Leaving aside classes where I was less than thrilled with the professor and looking solely at content, I'd have to say I hated property law the most. It was just so damn pointless. It's the hot dog of the law school curriculum, taking all the scraps and gristle left behind from the good stuff that gets it's own class. Wills, Trusts, and Estates, Divorce Law/Family Law, Real Estate, Commercial Transactions, etc., all the big stuff that one thinks would be property gets it own class, leaving behind the crap like the rule against perpetuities.    You might well be right. Yosemite could come with new hardwareit wouldn't shock me, but I'd be surprised... My guess is we'll see a more major update to the MBP early next year with Broadwell chips and possibly a redesign. July's update just bumped up processor speed.   Ah, gotcha. I thought it was a random manager wanting his employee to prove his disability to satisfy a customer. That wouldn't be okay. Family is different. :)   If this occurred in the United States, I would think it would violate the Americans with Disabilities Act for a manager to require Cody to remove his glasses. Might well raise EEOC issues too.   It is possible, but unlikely, given that the MacBook Pros were just refreshed in July. There'll always be a newer, better computer coming down the pike and sometimes you just need to take the plunge.   At the risk of being downvoted for ignoring what you said about avoiding Coinstar machines, did you know that Coinstar doesn't charge any fees if you get payment in the form of gift cards? I recently took 9 or 10 years of saved coins and got $70 in Amazon.com credit. I use Amazon all the time anyway, so it seemed just as good as cash.   I used Bookstore Movers and absolutely loved them. They certainly weren't the cheapest quote, but they did a great job. It was a painless process, all my stuff was well taken care of, and there was no time padding or lollygagging.   Serving papers can fall within the US Marshals Service's (USMS) bailiwick, particularly where there is danger or impracticality in having others do it. The USMS does not do their own investigations, save for fugitive investigations. They may assist with other investigations where they have particular expertise, but they aren't going to be the lead agency in a fraud case, for example.  As the prime enforcement arm of the courts (but an Executive Branch, not a Judicial Branch agency, mind you), US Marshals go after fugitives, serve court papers (including warrants, summons, etc.), protect judges and courthouses, assists with federal prisoner transports, and runs the witness protection program.   The USMS can also be the agency given odd jobs by statute, such as Adam Walsh Act giving the USMS responsibility for aiding state and local law enforcement with finding and arresting sex offenders who do not comply with sex offender registration, or the USMS essentially acting in the role of a county sheriff in Washington, DC because there IS no county-level sheriff's office. (In DC, US Marshals handle evictions, for example, something that they don't touch with a 20 foot pole anywhere else. They also handle both federal and DC prisoner transport, federal and DC courthouse security, process servers of last resort for DC-level civil cases, etc.)   First, does this provide probable cause to pull over every car with a small kid in the back texting on their phone? (Small kid=not something a cop can be expected to see as a car goes by.)  Second, as others have mentioned, with handsfree devices, one can translate texts to speech and speaks to text.  Third, I am skeptical that the technology is savy enough to distinguish between a text and data from legal apps like Google Maps, Waze, and similar apps that are entirely for the purpose of being run while someone is driving. (And if it can distinguish between data and texts, then police are supposed to spend lots of money on devices that can only catch texters but not people emailing while driving?)   Oh dear. Well, um, drawing steel in her defense was a sort of appropriate gesture. Contacting police would have been better, mind you.   Oh c'mon. You're not going to tell us the full story? :P   It also may depend on your other policies, your risk profile, and whether your insurance company offers it. I have both my car insurance and renter's insurance through State Farm, which may have helped me get the personal article policy.  	110
    There are a lot of skills and experiences that you can parse and structure well. It partly depends on whether you have effectively identified what types of jobs in the corporate world you think you are qualified for.   So I think the bigger question is identifying exactly what you are well suited for within the corporate landscape, and then tailoring your resume / recruitment for that switch.  You can check out a site like tapwage.com to see what types of jobs there are at both large corporations or startups that might translate to your specific interests and skills. After that you really want to tailor your resume as closely to the job postings as possible, especially given the use of resume screening software / ATS.  If you have a very non-traditional background, you could perhaps specifically look at startups that are more open to that background (also are unlikely to use ATS / resume screening software so gives you more of a chance to tell your story).   Targeting categories of jobs and companies is key to a successful transition in your case. The way you portray your specific experiences falls out of that.     1. Try and give them real projects with real responsibilities instead of just training / demo projects or shadowing full time employees, or rotating through a lot of groups. Ideally - projects are weekly, with end of week check-ins, and a chance to discuss work at Monday morning meetings. This is critical to make them feel a part of the time and get a sense of what the job is actually like full-time  2. If possible, have them seated in a large bull-pen or conference room together. The camaraderie is important and they end up teaching each other a ton and getting up to speed much faster than if seated separately across the office.  3. Goes without saying that mid-internship reviews are important but also important to be very candid during these sessions so they get a real measure of performance. Ideally do this at the 40% mark (since the last week or so of internships aren't really very active)  4. Again, probably obvious but activities outside the office help a lot - whether its a bowling event or volunteering. But it's only effective if you get full-time employees there across levels, so get that buy-in early.  5. I have found formal "mentor" programs very ineffective, and tried them in a  range of formats (junior mentors, senior mentors, peer mentors). Interns tend to find their own mentors and as long as they are on projects with real responsibility, they do ok.   6. Meals are important and often that's a way to integrate them into the firm and spur conversations. If your office doesn't typically eat together in the office, may require planning to either create opportunities for them to do meals together with other employees (less formal than typical intern brown bag lunches though).     Both are determined, super smart and capable. My guess is Arya because she has actually killed before, and especially with the training she received at the temple of the many faced god.       "It's a UNIX system! I know this!"  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFUlAQZB9Ng          You won't be able to share your code from the current job but you will be able to talk to your skills and experiences, and a large enterprise app will probably much more valuable in an interview process than side projects (although you should always pursue side projects if you can, to keep sharp).  While on this large project, don't make the rookie mistake of sticking in a corner and not paying attention to how things get put together. Pay attention to what different teams are doing, how they work together, how unit and regression testing is conducted, how version control and builds are managed, how user provisioning is managed, how programming teams interface with database administration and infrastructure teams. Volunteer, take an interest, demonstrate initiative. That will really help you understand the guts of a large enterprise deployment and help you shine in a future interview. Taking that initiative will help you much more in future interviews and job applications than using a few hours a week to develop test applications.   Moreover, if you just started work in May 2015, give it some time before you start worrying about your next job. Ideally give it a year or two and get yourself settled. Applying too soon to a new job could easily hurt your chances as you will be seen as not being a team player or not having a strong skill set (there will be concerns that you didn't cut it in your current job).   Good luck.       It's hard to pick just 5.    Damn - I wish I had Beatles, Dre and Queen on my list too.    I would want that list to be as diverse as possible so I capture a wide range of musical choices. And each of them would need to have a really big discography to make it worth it. So my list would be:  1. Oasis (for rock) 2. Joe Purdy (for folk) [So torn on whether him or Paul Simon or Dylan] 3. Daft Punk (for dance) 4. Yo Yo Ma (for classical) 5. Michael Jackson (for pop)  This reminds me of the BBC radio show / podcast called "Desert Island Discs" which I love. It makes celebrities / writers choose 8 tracks that they would take with them to a desert island. Their choices often reveal so much more about them than a plain interview would.        Jay Leno. Seriously - who really likes one liners any more?    me too! I think he is very poignant and makes me think but just isn't funny to me. I much prefer Carlin, Chappelle or Chris Rock when it comes to interspersing social commentary and comedy.    Put the python related projects on your resume. Put them on github and then you can link to them. At least it's a talking point that demonstrates your initiative when it comes to computer science. Way too many computer science graduates go through school without doing anything outside of their core curriculum requirements.  In terms of open source, you need to build your way up. I am not sure what types of projects you have done using the Reddit API but perhaps you can find other related projects on github and try contributing to those repositories.  Projects where you get to work with other developers, and someone else codebase can be especially rewarding.  I would strongly advise you not to approach all these projects with the mindset of "what would look good on my resume". Follow your curiosity and find projects that interest you, whether its an app to solve a problem you have had, or helping with a small patch to a piece of software you use, or if you are just looking to see how larger projects work in the real world. Following your interests will take you to surprising places, give you real depth and that will show in your interviews. Padding your resume with projects just for the sake of your resume might work in the near term but it won't make you a bette programmer and worse, it might get you to stop enjoying programming.     This reminds me of one of my favorite songs from Flight of the Conchord  - hiphopopotamus vs. rhymenoceros, where Brett says:  "Yes, sometimes my lyrics are sexist But you lovely bitches and hoes should know I'm trying to correct this"  I love that show.

Sidewalks aren't large enough and second hand smoke is awful. Find a secluded spot, and for goodness sake, don't smoke near a bus stop or some place where people have to wait and can't avoid the smoke.       I was in a cab the other day and the driver looked stressed as all hell. Told me that he levered up to buy the medallion at $1 million thinking it was the safest investment he could make, and immediately after, the price fell to $500k. He needed to declare personal bankruptcy. It was heartbreaking to hear.    Just suggest a call and find out what types of roles they have on offer. Might be spam, might be useful. Worth 10 minutes over the phone but would avoid an in-person meeting right away.             so is "Let's just agree to disagree"        	34

 Yes, I mean the notification light. I had a Motorola Bravo before the SGS2 and really liked the notification light.  Good to know it works...I keep unlocking the phone so often, maybe I've missed the flashing :-/  Thanks!   Yeah I can't decide too.  I really like it in Google Now. It's a very intuitive way to deal with all the information, but outside of it...I'm not sure yet. Especially when you can't swipe them away.      Before, Google now, now Google play   I keep trying to swipe them away   A swipe to the left, a swipe to the right   Nothing happens, they're stuck there tight!   Cards should be consistent, shouldn't they?   Behave everywhere, they should the same way   Instead, they vary between apps, and in time   Like, you know, the scheme of this rhyme.     Grad students! Except the company is the university.    Those are brilliant pictures!    What bike is the jumping bike?   Yeah next year sounds good. Ten years later, it won't matter if I climbed Adams before Rainier or Rainier before Adams ;-)  I bought the book, thanks for the recommendation!       I'm not getting fucked... At all :-(   Foreveralone humour... Always funnier in your head!    Will do!   0. Iron Post is still around for live music.  1. The bars are open, but less crowded. 2. Redditors like me are open to meetups    I have DTExpress IV, that I've used lovingly (as lovingly as drummers can, I guess).   Everything works perfectly. The module is still doing its job impeccably and you can upgrade all the pads and use the same module. At least, when I bought the drumkit, it was the same module across kits.  This is the kit: http://www.amazon.com/Yamaha-DTXPRESS-Special-Electronic-Drum/dp/B000YK9XB8/ref=cm_cr_pr_product_top  Except for the snare pad, which is not the mesh pad as shown in the figure, but just a normal pad with three zones.  The item is no longer manufactured by Yamaha, though I believe they are still using the module in their entry level kits.  PM me if interested. I can't ship this and don't have a car...but it can sort of fit into a reasonable trunk for short distances. With a truck, it's not a problem at all.   Really? Lucky you!  I'm working with a Geophysics professor now, and he's forcing me to use R. If he'd used Matlab, I could have worked so much quicker :(     I use CU Bus guide. It could be better, but it's quite good and usable right now. It has Nearby stops and easily accessible Favourites...which is more than enough for my usage.   Yeah it takes a while...Because it's interpreted, it's quite slow.   But if you learn to/can vectorize your loops, even the speed is not bad at all!   The advantage of matlab is that functions are available for everything! And array manipulation and vector operations are brilliantly simple.  There are many disadvantages, but it's really good as a (scripting-ish) language only for scientific computing and engineering work. It's what it's meant for.   Yes. It can be used to do very big things, like run wind tunnels and really big and complicated experiments.    Thanks! My plan was to switch to T-Mobile prepaid in any case with the Nexus 4. So this way I'll get the Nexus, use it for a year and switch to T-Mobile prepaid when the contract is done!      Yup...RAW it's going to be for sure...thanks!   Wow..thanks a lot!! That's a lot of information right there. Saving the comment and keeping it for reference!    Me, I prefer to fuck brave people. Not just here. Anywhere.   I've been photographing stuff (mountains and people and leading lines and frames...) for about five years now, but haven't really been doing any processing. Mainly because I really liked the act of getting out in the world and taking pictures, but didn't really feel the need to do much else.  Because of my laziness, my photos now lie scattered across various hard disks, each representing a different era in terms of age, photographic maturity and file naming convention.  I want to set up a workflow now, because I'm starting to feel a need to get organized. I've decided to use Lightroom for this task, because as far as I can see, it has more than enough power to do all the processing I want to do, and also has enough strengths to force me to organize stuff.  I want to learn Lightroom properly. No shortcuts, no nothing. So what should I do? What are some common pitfalls I should look out for? What should I certainly NOT do?  Thanks a lot for any advice you can give me!   My friends and I.  Our experience level would be equivalent to the first half of a basic mountaineering course, I guess. We know how to use ice axes and crampons and have used both on climbs before. I can handle ropes from some rock climbing experience, but I haven't used ropes on mountains.  The only reason I ask for Mt Rainier is that I don't really know what being a glacial mountain entails in terms of climbing...what would that be?    I really do want to do mountaineering. I've done some technical climbing before in the Sierra Nevadas and I love it. But I do think it wasn't *too* challenging and it certainly wasn't on a glacier..   I do have questions!  1/ It does look like I won't be able to train this year, so I might have to postpone climbing to next year. I'm getting to Washington by August. What training do you suggest? Where? I dont really want guided tours. I would rather take the time to learn myself and go once I'm ready.  2/ How have you been preparing for this? Do you have experience with glacial climbing?  3/ Nothing here...Thanks for your help! If you're in Seattle and we meet, beer is on me!   That's exactly the issue. I know very little about glacier travel... I'm happy to do training, but I'm not getting to the area till August and then it might be too late to do both training and climbing.  Do you know places in Illinois or whereabouts that offer training?        I'm thinking of climbing Mt Rainier in August by the[ Disappointment Cleaver](http://www.summitpost.org/disappointment-cleaver/155670)  I have experience backpacking and climbing mountains with some degree of technical stuff. The route above seems doable.  However, what is this I read about special climbing passes for glacier mountains? Is it necessary? Does everyone in my group have to get it or just me?  Any other advice that you can give me will be awesome!  Thanks!   Gravity and centripetal force will act in different directions. Centripetal force acts towards the axis of rotation (in the same plane as the latitude at that point), while gravity acts towards the center of the earth. AT the poles, there is no rotation and hence no centripetal force.  The weight you measure of course, is the sum of all the forces acting towards the center of the earth, so the centripetal force is included in there. Yes, it does reduce your weight.  Not sure why I'm being downvoted, because I'm right. The direction of the forces is different. They're the same at the equator (where the axis passes through the center of the earth) and different at every other latitude.   It's because you're working against gravity when you're running uphill. Running uphill is the equivalent of having an extra weight on your back when running on flat land. More work - More difficulty.   Ha. The day lines of attack are based on consistency...will be a very good day for sure. But it is not today, evidently.   Huh. Actually, you're right. That sentence was quite badly worded.  It's really cool of you that while laughing at my word choice and sentence structure, you also took the time to answer the questions I raised.   The links only showcased promiscuity and prevalence of STDs, neither of which represent inefficiency or anti-social tendencies.  Also, the study was flawed not by misconduct, but by poor research practices. If you talk about effects of gay parenting on children, the parents at the very least, have to be gay, right?  EDIT: Also, the real assertion was that inefficiency and anti-social tendencies have something to do with marriage rights.   So let's see: Gay people are anti-social. No. Gay people are inefficient. I suddenly realized I don't even know what inefficient means in this context. Unless you're talking about the fact that they can't have kids with both parents procreating with each other, that's a No too.   Even if there were some fictional group of people who were anti-social and "inefficient", why wouldn't you want them to get married? Marriage will only help with anti-social tendencies and whatever inefficiencies are.   I want to break free.   My code is running in the background, so I have some time and will explore each of these links.  Okay, done exploring. Overall, you seem to be saying that gay people are more promiscuous because of which they have a higher incidence of STDs, which is already well known, is it not? Is that the point you're trying to get across? How does this make them anti-social or inefficient, which is what the commenter above you asked?   More importantly, what does that have to do with gay marriage? Anti-social and inefficient people can't marry the ones they love?    This is the only relevant article you've posted...which I had to take from a different comment:   http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0049089X12000610  The study seemed interesting and convincing. Till you realize that what the study treats as "children of gay parents" are actually not that at all. They are children of people who have had at least one homosexual relationship at ANY point in their life, even if they are now heterosexual and happily married to the love of their life, who is of the opposite sex. That is an extreme misrepresentation of what the study purports to say. More info here: http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/beyond-blood/201206/flawed-study-gay-parenting-roundup-recent-media-coverage-and-critiques  http://www.cdc.gov/nchhstp/Newsroom/msmpressrelease.html[1]  This says that gay people have a higher incidence of HIV (isn't that well known and accepted already) and suggests that more prevention efforts need to be targeted at them. Very sensible and true. Not sure what that has to do with gay marriage, though.    http://www.cdc.gov/msmhealth/for-your-health.htm[2]  Again, HIV. What does this have to do with gay marriage? Many diseases (some just as serious has HIV) have large variations across various ethnic and minority and every other kind of groups. Not sure what that has to do with marriage rights.  http://chipts.ucla.edu/2012/05/29/a-comparison-of-sexual-behavior-patterns-among-men-who-have-sex-with-men-and-heterosexual-men-and-women/[3]  This one is again about HIV. In fact, it says: "MSM reported more consistent condom use during anal sex than was reported during vaginal sex by heterosexuals."   While that means gay people are taking care of the HIV thing (and still have higher HIV incidence rates for a myriad of reasons), I still don't see what that has to do with marriage rights.    http://www.thebody.com/content/67321/a-comparison-of-sexual-behavior-patterns-among-men.html[4]  Dude! (Or Dudette). That has exactly the same text as the previous link. Come on!  http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1876122/pdf/canmedaj01409-0056.pdf[5]  If you're trying to make the point that more healthcare efforts need to be targeted towards gay people, you're making an excellent point. I agree completely. But I still don't understand what that has to do with the issue here, which is gay marriage. Why are you using promiscuity as some yardstick for marriage rights? It doesn't make sense to me.   http://factsaboutyouth.com/posts/promiscuity/[6]  Okay, first of all, enough with the promiscuity. Gay people have more sex. Good for them! Tell them to use condoms (or whatever it is that lesbians need to use).   That site says "Reorientation therapy" has been shown to be effective. What the fuck, man? The American Association of Pediatrics said: "The document and website repeat distorted claims that sexual orientation and gender identity are changeable by reparative therapy and that if theyre not reinforced in youth, then their homosexuality and/or transgenderism will eventually go away." (http://www2.aap.org/featured/sexualorientation.htm)  www.cdc.gov/msmhealth/STD.htm[7]  Woah...Cool link. Thanks for telling me that there are diseases that can be transmitted via sex.   http://lgbtdrugrehab.com/addiction-treatment-statistics[8]  That's a nice link.    http://i.imgur.com/zhiHA.jpg[9] [RES ignored duplicate image] (bug chasing)  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oKCcr_ayvMo[10] (bug chasing documentary)  Oh wow...wtf.

It's not like he went around saying "Hey I have a disease...come get it!"    http://www.dispatch.com/content/stories/local/2012/08/10/cdc-has-new-plan-for-gonorrhea.html[13] (Homosexuals create a resistant strain of gonorrhea just as scientists are getting HIV under control)  That article actually says gay and bisexual people have increased *resistance* toward gonorrhea and the incidence is reducing in the West of the US. Not sure what you're trying to say.  Okay, back to coding.  **tl;dr**: Good to know you're an atheist. Good to know (I mean in the way that more knowledge is good) that there is a higher incidence of STDs among gay people and more health efforts need to be targeted towards them. Good to know that drug rehabilitation centers are able to target efforts to them as well. None of this however, makes gay people anti-social or inefficient. And the only link that talked about gay marriage didn't talk about gay marriage.    Smart man.   Just curious: What's a miles card (as in, how is it different from a normal credit card/airlines credit card)? What does it mean to pay cash with it?   And here I thought RES was scrolling wrong.   You think the grass is greener on your side. Gay people probably think their side is greener.   Doesn't matter where the grass is greener. Lay on it and look up at the rainbow.   Nikon 55-200 mm zoom lens for sale. I'm downgrading to a Micro 4/3rds from a Nikon DSLR. Already sold the camera. Now looking to sell lens.  This is the lens I'm talking about:  http://www.amazon.com/Nikon-55-200mm-f4-5-6G-AF-S-Nikkor/dp/B0009HN57Y/ref=sr_1_6?ie=UTF8 qid=1365775040 sr=8-6 keywords=55-200+mm+nikon+lens  All is well with the lens. PM me if interested.   That's how my jeans tore!! I've been wondering so long..   Here are some:  **Near**   Meadowbrook park -- 2 miles paved...~3 if you keep taking deviations into the grass trails and coming back onto the paved trail.   Crystal lake -- ~ 2 miles road. Some grass.   Busey woods (right by crystal lake) -- 2 miles on the trail. 1 mile on the boardwalk   Japan house+ Arboretum -- about 5 miles all around including some pseudo-hidden trails.  **Far** (20 miles):  Lake of the woods -- They have lots of running trails. Paved   Homer Lake -- 4 miles trail around the lake. Really, really cool trail...My favourite of the bunch.   Mahomet -- Been biking there..quite a long biking trail with lots of runners too...Paved.    **Farther** (20 miles):  Allerton -- Very beautiful place. Around 4 miles of trails.   Kickapoo -- Some short trails. One long 5 mile trail (RiverSomething it's called)   Turkey run -- Lots of trails (about 10) ranging from 1 mile to 6      I went to undergrad in India. And my college used to host an intercollegiate festival with various competitions. One of these was a fashion show, which was cancelled by the dean because of supposedly indecent exposure.  I was pissed. So I wrote an email, met him and tried to convince him for an hour...to no avail.  So my friend and I decided to take the air out of his scooter tires. We drove up there at night, but couldn't figure out which out of three his scooter was.  So instead, we went up all the way to the third floor to his house and stole his milk bag.  That was our fuck you to the system. One day without milk for the dean!   I'm taking CS 418 right now...it's nothing you can't learn on your own with a little enthusiasm, because tutorials abound online for every topic that's taught in the class.  Most of every MP can be just solved directly from examples on the web.  If you're really interested in Graphics and are prepared to go above and beyond the call of duty, it's a great course. Otherwise, you can get by and get a reasonable grade without really learning much.    Me too. And I did it after I read your comment. Umm... just to make sure you were actually that dumb.  I was right. Ha!      Only rich people can get respect because their car breaks down!   Uh shit. The funny thing is...the pressure cooker I use right now is one of those oval lid ones...  Actually it's not so funny. Imagining those things bursting is really scary...Because they fit inside, so the explosion must be even worse :O   Enough remained in the cooker for lunch, thankfully... And they tasted great!    It's on the album Voice (the studio version).

Indian reporting in. We use pressure cookers for a lot of our cooking. Lentils. Rice. Vegetables...  Once I was trying to impress my mum with my newly acquired cooking skills. She left for work with the promise of lentils when she came back. Well, the cooker "exploded". It was loud. The lid was around the cooker. But the lentils were everywhere. The ceiling (11 ft high), the walls of the kitchen. Some of them even made it to the adjacent rooms.  Though if you follow instructions, you'll be fine.      Those were actually the lines I was most uncomfortable with...now I know why! Thanks! :)   It's meant to be choppy, yes. Punctuation's always a hassle for me. I never know what to do really. So usually, I just take it all out.   I could ideally space the poem out more with whitespace, but that seems a little pretentious to me.   Thanks for the feedback!

It's good to see that you made the switch and are happy with it... It gives me a lot of confidence.  Thanks!    That's just the body, right? With the lens, the cost ist at $400. The E-PL3 is available for $300 with lens refurbished at Cameta, and I'm leaning towards it.  Any reason to prefer the GX1 over the E-PL3?   What do you mean by 12 MP sensors are weak? I don't really mind the difference between 12 and 16 MP since I won't be making large prints...but is there something else technical to consider that makes the 16 MP version better?   Ah...thanks! So 10-30 mm is equivalent to 18-55 mm?   I can always buy the lenses later, when my budget gets replenished :)   With my D40 I had a zoom (55-200) that I never used. I was very happy with my prime (50 mm) even though I had to focus manually and the kit 18-55 lens.   There are some amazing deals on Camera...I'm leaning towards the E-PL3...It's available for $299...do you think that's a good price?   I was just going to ask that...In fact, the E-PL3 from Cameta refurbished is $299  EDIT: Here's a decent comparison in which E-PL2 turns out to be the winner: http://snapsort.com/compare/Olympus-E-PL2-vs-Olympus_PEN_E-PL1   I've used  Nikon D40 for six years and I've always imagined that I'll be upgrading an SLR with better specs.  But this recent onslaught of mirrorless cameras with slightly smaller sensors has really got me intrigued. My main aim with photography is to take good pictures while hiking and backpacking. So these cameras seem to fit perfectly into what I want to do.  Does anyone have experience using them? What brands/models would you recommend? What are the numbers I should be looking out for?   My budget is around $500. Megapixels don't matter and I don't have to have the newest model at all. So there are a lot of options from me from Nikon, Panasonic, Sony, Olympus... Any help?    And then I felt better about myself... Because he was worse off than me.   Man, I don't get the point of these quotes   Not a noob, kind Sir/Ma'am. But I get your point, shall move on!   My last laptop ran only Linux...the distro varied through the years, but Linux was all that was on it.  I bought the Vizio CT15-A5 ultrabook recently and it's gorgeous and all, but it comes with Windows 8.  Does anyone have any experience with how Linux friendly this laptop is w.r.t hardware?  Also, I remember reading about problems with dual booting with Windows 8...UEFI and all that? What kind of issues arise because of that?  Thank you for any help you kind people provide.   For Algorithms, *The Algorithm Design Manual* by Skiena is incredible. It's written well and skimps a bit on rigor knowingly and just enough to give you an intuitive idea of what's going on.  For Machine Learning, it's best if you take one of the courses on coursera (or read the notes that you have AND implement the assignments/homeworks) because you learn much more even about the theoretical aspects by implementation.  In my experience so far (MS in Computer Science with research in Machine Learning/Computer Vision) Information theory is used only sparingly, and when used, it's more to say that "From Information theory, we know that...."     I assume they're just making the app full screen and implementing their own notification system..   Not sure though, really.. Not my area of expertise.    No. I think the article says the HTC First is the only phone that will show the actual notifications.  What that means is that if you were to download the Home app on a Samsung Galaxy S3 you wouldn't get system notifications while using the new Facebook Home app.  You would still get them inside Android, but you wouldn't get them in the Home notifications," confirmed Ondrejka.   The bicycling equivalent of the high beam.   Thanks! I'll take your advice and drive around in May and then look for apartments again when I come back in August...all good!   I did read the sidebar, actually...I was more curious about the dates...Thanks for the information!     Yo all,  I'm moving to Seattle in August. I was planning to come down (well up) with my dad in May and look for apartments. Is that too early?   Given that I'll be working in downtown, where should I be thinking about living? I don't mind a longish commute if the neighborhood is worth it. My cousin sings praises of Capitol Hill.  Thanks for any help provided!    Urbana-Champaign here.   Yup I agree with that. I had far fewer bridges to cross than OP.   But the point I'm trying to make is that the companies won't care. They will only look at how good a programmer he/she is when he/she applies, not whether he has a BS degree. At least some companies.     If      Well, the job I got had nothing to do with Aerospace...I guess it did help me get my foot in the door.   To get the job, all you need CS coding skills. Just learn from coursera or something.  I was taking CS courses all along even when I was in Aero because I liked that stuff. So really, if you like programming, keep programming and things will fall into place.    Yes. I have a BS in Aero, an MS in aero, a PhD in Aero that I quit in order to pursue an MS in CS.  2 months into the MS, I had a job. I think it's more of what's on your resume, because software companies really, really need good talent. So build your skillset and you should be good to go.    Ooh nice question.  Arbitrarily small sizes are a pain because molecular effects come into play. But even there, angular momentum is conserved (I think...I vaguely remember something about conserving angular momentum...but an expert shoudl chime in).  But otherwise, angular momentum has nothing to do with restriction. It's a property of the particles. For water with no bathtub, angular momentum is conserved. The angular momentum of the whole ocean is conserved too.  The angular momentum of fluid particles rotating about a vortex center is conserved, irrespective of how close you get to the center (arbitrarily small size), if that's what you're asking. I keep talking about vortices because they kind of generate angular momentum in flows. But the discussion holds true in their absence too, of course.    Yes. All the time. Fill bathtub with water, rotate hand. Remove hand. Angular momentum is conserved, or rather, would have been conserved if it hadn't been for that cursed viscosity.  Planes fly because of lift. Lift generation is explained by vortex structures leaving the plane. The behavior of these vortices (again discounting for cursed viscosity) is governed by the conservation of angular momentum, among other things.  Angular momentum is a property that applies to anything that Newton's Laws applies to, because its conservation is a form of Newton's Laws!    I think the account is active for a year, after which forwarding is active for two more. Not sure of the exact numbers, but it's in that ballpark.   Except for stop signs, the other two are legal. Cyclists CAN cross as both pedestrians and vehicles and it is in fact acceptable for them to ride on the road. Unless you're talking about pedestrian sidewalks..those bikers be bad.   It is not really just stretching. Breathing and meditation are what make Yoga, yoga.   It's taught in a form that emphasizes the stretching here, which is sad, but necessary to market it effectively.  The benefits that are marketed (inner peace and all that crap) don't come without a huge investment of time and effort into Yoga. And personally, I believe that a similar focus on any activity will give you the same inner peace and crap.  To be fair, Yoga as it was intended is only a way of living. There is even a Yoga called Karma Yoga which says that if you do your duty, you are doing yoga.   I think what differentiates Yoga from other fitness activities is the philosophical backend. That philosophical backend, however is transferable to any activity. I don't know why people don't do that...maybe because Yoga is a selling point...   I'll answer the two parts separately (source: My mom received a PhD in Yoga and is part of the transitioning of knowledge from the second half (what the "inventors" did) to the first half (today's scientifically accepted facts )).   Also, this is an Indian perspective. It seems similar to what I see in the US, but I don't know if my cultureFilter glasses are effective.  The "original" Yogasanas were only loosely scientific. They were based more on the "sages" experimenting with their bodies. When I move this part, I feel something in that part, so if I stretch this way, it must be beneficial. Also, that animal seems to look cool in that pose. It seems like that will help me, let me try that.   I know that's vague, but the point is that they did not do experiments in a repeatable, verifiable manner. There were no guidelines for people with problems to not do certain asanas. So no, they were not scientific.  However, personal anecdotes and development led to a very strong belief in Yoga. Especially since it was so intimately tied to the Hindu religion.   Forward to today: There are yoga quacks who teach yogasanas. I know of a case where a teacher made his students do a complex breathing exercise (Bastri + Kapalabhati). He DID NOT tell them (probably did not know either) that the exercise involves extensive use of the lower back. And people came to my mom with damaged lower backs... and they just wanted to do more Yoga to help!! (Well, yoga is excellent for lower back problems, but I'mn sure you see the point I'm making).  The only way out of this is to scientifically examine the effects and benefits of Yoga, and that's what a LOT of researchers are doing these days.  The problem is that the scientific method looks at Yogasanas in a very atomic way instead of a holistic way since well, the "holistic" way is not scientific. It's a fair compromise, I think.  I digressed a lot there. but:   *tl;dr*: Inventors of Yoga made up asanas based on trial and error and logic. They did not go ahead to scientifically test the benefits and effects of their asanas because they believed in self-experimentation. So, scientific examination is being done today.      I have this conversation sometimes with my friend in fleeting corridor moments.  Me: What's up?   Him: You too.      Neither did I! I was just making a bad joke about the importance of punctuation in your second attempt at perfect honesty.   TBPH,  the joke didn't even make sense.    It's always good to be perfectly honest    I think what eshemuta means is something similar to what you are saying and it is something I experienced recently.  On a hike near Seattle, I didn't take my camera and I was marveling at the scenery and the light and the place. I could see the scene completely differently because of my efforts with photography. But without the thoughts of taking a picture, the experience was completely different.  It's like sitting for half an hour on your streetcorner, admiring the light and...that's it. It's a different experience. Different from the photographer taking the picture and different from the guy who likes the view, but doesn't know the things a photographer does.   Yeah you just create a new category saying "The ones that don't follow any of the above patterns and follows unpredictable reality", which is exactly the case here.   I agree with all you said in the first paragraph... But to me, people who achieve that state of writing  regularly, writing with discipline... They're magicians..   Discipline is the new magic. The old magic is just a bag of tricks.    Wow...that video was intense!   "Big Data" is a buzzword these days, and any company that deals with them is looking for Data Scientists and are very pleased if you can show some Machine Learning background.  Of course, robotics is booming. Companies are looking for talent very seriously and they need MS students that can do their work.   Yup, that's what I thought too.  But then, here they're only worried about making it look realistic. For example, if you wanted the stresses at every point on the cloth when you tear it this code wouldn't give it. But your months-to-make code will.   If I was the head of a clothing company, I would use your code to design my clothes, and his code for advertising.  Though it *is* still *amazing*, that they're able to simulate the looks of a cloth tearing.    They call it simple because an analytic solution is available that they can compare the numerical solution to.  It's just an exponential term plus an error term.    I just saw this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8Vwu4cdFFw   And then exploration began...hadn't heard of her before... now can't stop listening to her!      If you're problem is depression, this isn't the subreddit you should be looking for answers in.    I don't think the balance is fine at all. I'm heavily on your side in this argument. Googling is okay, I guess, only as long as you make sure you're understanding what's going on enough to not make the same mistake.   And that understanding is kind of enforced if you don't have Google...   Well... The line is kind of fine :-)    Oh...yeah that's not your fault either. They should see EE and Java and realize that you probably know Java and programming through your EE courses, which have a very different emphasis than the CS courses.   I was an Aerospace PhD who switched to a CS Masters...so I feel ya.  It would help though, if you read up a bit on Design Patterns and Algorithms...What I did was read up on two CS courses -- 1/ Data Structures and 2/ Algorithms ... that should cover your bases.  In interviews, they generally ask you to rate your skills on a 1 to 10. Be honest. Say you're comfortable with the language, but are learning the concepts, and then talk a bit about Abstract classes and Singletons and all that cool stuff you think they think you should know.  	99

                      Yayy!               Poll [PDF](http://morningconsult.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/150502_crosstabs_mc_NH_v1_AD.pdf)      Didn't even see that, thank you!       Ha.   You complained about an opinion/analysis piece, when you are reading entries to a subreddit that is based on opinions/analysis. So sorry, thought you would have understood that; didn't know I had to clarify.      I replied.   I guess you don't understand the fact that *I don't care* about what you think. I believe that the message is a good one, and for that reason, I posted it.   *Get over it* and **go complain elsewhere.**  Furthermore, /r/inthenews is for opinion and analysis--so, if you don't want analysis or opinion then don't come to this particular subreddit with your complaints. Find an opinion/analysis you like or support and post it--but don't come here and whine about opinion pieces.       Go for it                  Yes!!                  I'm an asshole, I'm so sorry lol   Still not editorialized. You can have an opinion on the quote--and as you perceive it to imply some sort of 'weakness'. However, I see it has passion, strength, and commitment. The *fact* remains that the title was not editorialized as you initially suggested it was.       Very true   Finally, speaking some truth Clinton may have opinions on these and other topics and wont tell us what they are. Alternatively, she may only figure out what she thinks once the political winds are settled. Either way, this is not presidential behavior.            Thank you!   Taking a direct quote from the article is not editorializing the headline/title.                   Agreed, reading and I would say embrace the outdoors   Wondering the same thing... It would be totally awkward if they just sat there stiff not eating lmao. I'll try to find out though :)   omg lol, I didn't even notice. eeek :/   I totally agree with you! Last month almost *all* HP articles were downplaying his candidacy as well as his personality and/or the way he looks/dresses (but that's one of the things I love most about him--he doesn't care what people think; all he cares about is getting the job done).                           	61
 Numbers?   Based on the very little I know about this sport, I feel expanding the 'court' to allow a third player on each team would make it a lot better. A goalie who maybe had a bike geared (pun unintended) towards less actual movement and more blocking (I have no idea what such a bike would look like. Scenes from Mad Max come to mind), almost like the special gear of a hockey goalie. Without a dedicated goal keeper the threat of the hail-mary-cherry-picker is all to real. A third player would also add to the intensity and awesomeness.  I feel like I'm writing a letter to the minister of cycle ball or something.   Welp, I'm off to Google 'quasi-legally'.   What in the hell...   Lol thought you were going to say /r/trees, which is kind of a perfect fit.   Aw, fuck now I absolutely gotta go find my little guy just for a hug:( This might be a bit of a search, he's very small and very quiet.   I'm about 85% sure there are pieces of actual cookies in it.   Wait...  never buy off the streets  But...but how did they get it??   Dyslexic, edud!   sweet dude   Dude, Americone Dream is where it's at. Either that or Milk and Cookies. Not Cookie Dough, Milk and Cookies. Big difference. Fuck, now I gotta go get Ben and Jerrys.   I wish I had more than one sibling to understand the concept of one being a butt and one not. I can't imagine looking at one sibling very differently than the others.   I grossly misunderstood two things about your story:  **A:** I thought you were a girl the whole time. Not sure why, sorry about that. Had to reread a second time to figure that out.  **B:** I thought they were 6 and 11 years younger than *you*. I could not for the life of me understand why you were taking a nine year old (don't disprove me with math, I'm in no condition) to an R rated movie, let alone smoking with them. Had to reread about three and a half times before I figured that one out.  **C:** How was Ted   Did...did you have super sonic hearing too?   I just saw Dark Skies, and I'm 100% convinced you got abducted by aliens.  EDIT: Dude, everyone should watch Dark Skies. It'll change you...   Kelly, Toby and Ryan were all executive producers.   I'm not sure who made [this] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIuxXrYgnWg) or why...but I'm kind of glad they did.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u413w8TQx0o   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzdCYse5NB8   "NOOOOOOOOO, GOD. NO GOD, PLEASE NO. NOO. NOOOOOOOOOOOOO- Office theme*   **The Battle of Red Cliffs**  Unlike most military victories where the smaller side somehow scares the other side into foolishly fleeing or surrendering, Zhou Yu beat 800,000 men with his measly 50,000 *in battle*. He did it by first antagonizing the opposing Emperor Cao Cao to attacking his position across the Yangtze River. Before crossing however, one of his spies working as an adviser for Cao Cao recommended that he chain his ships together to 'reduce sea sickness among the unseasoned soldiers'. As soon as Yu saw the misinformed fleet attempt to cross he sent fire boats at them, which started a fire that spread to every ship given their conveniently close proximity to one another. That was the battle that ended the Han dynasty. Imagine being the person that ended your own dynasty with 800,000 men against 50,000. And that's just the smallest estimate, others said it was upwards of 200,000.   Holy shit, those birds from the Windex commercials were right...   (Yes) ?   I'll pretend to get it   It's just 'Pound', not Pound Town. Nice try, OP.   "She definitely noticed"   No, it's just bad. I assume you're on Netflix? Instead, watch...  **[Nightcrawler] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8kYDQan8bw)** Unless you're easily creeped out. Jake Gyllenhaal plays a rather...odd character, and he absolutely nail the roll. It's good though, all about people who film accidents and dangerous events for the news and maybe even go a little too far to get the shot. Awesome movie, I might be over hyping the creepiness a little.  **[The Big Lebowski] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cd-go0oBF4Y)** Hilarious, well at least to normal people. Some don't seem to 'understand' this type of humor. I've honestly never loved Jeff Bridges more than after seeing The Big Lebowski, and that's saying a lot for me. In my humble opinion, everyone in the world should see this movie.  **[Dark Skies] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8iLp1xQtPQ)** One of my favorite and most underrated horror movies out there. Soo many good ideas in it, I'm not sure who directed Dark Skies but they did a great job. And J.K. Simmons is in it! Totally my tempo.  **[Chef] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgFws3AoIUY)** *WARNING: THIS WILL MAKE THE MUNCHIES ABOUT A MILLION TIMES WORSE. PROCEED WITH CAUTION* I have no idea how they got so many big name actors in an indie movie, but they did it. I'm usually not one for the easy, unstimulating watches, but they managed to keep this movie a little edgy at the same time. Would definitively recommend.  **[Inglorious Bastards] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AtLlVNsuAc)** One of my favorite Tarantino movies out there. Plenty of blood and gore so be prepared for that. If you like that one, you'll love **[Django] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUdM9vrCbow)** too. Christopher Waltz and Quentin Tarantino together again! Django also (although it isn't a commedy movie) has one of the [funniest scenes] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BsaxyraBdQ8) ever too. Not sure why Jonah Hill agreed to come out just for one scene, but I'm sure glad he did. Amazing acting in both movies.  **[Hot Fuzz] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayTnvVpj9t4)** I can't be the only one that fucking loves Simon Pegg and Nick Frost. Personally, my favorite is Paul, but that one isn't on Netflix. Awesome awesome awesome movie though.  **[Arrested Development] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfU2Td_MMf0)** It's not a movie (it's a TV show) but just give the first episode a shot, and I promise there's like a 70% chance you'll absolutely fall in love with it. Probably my favorite comedy TV show of all time. And Netflix is making season 5 as we speak!   I won't even ask how the lighter fits into the equation.   In my experience, everything suddenly turns to slow motion, you turn to your smoke mates in despair, cue [the dream] (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16i0_NdPowE t=0m10s), and dramatically drop the roach off the bow of the ship as you wipe a lone tear from your eye. Adieu, sweet blunt, adieu.   Good god I could go on for hours. What kind of music are you into, lets start there.   Holy hell, looks like quite a night.   In a hot tub a friend of mine once said "it feels like I'm being massaged by a thousand tiny hands".   Is 'piss flaps' a common UK expression?   I'd like to know more as well.   I was wondering for way too long why anyone would dip fruit in ranch dressing.   Not sure why, but I expected a rather long and elaborate story developing the setting and aftermath of such a story.  yea   Lucky for you, you'll never find a person that ever says such a ridiculous thing.   I'm so confused   OP, I'm a little rusty on my Nepalese marijuana policy info, is it legal? If not, is it illegal enough to stop you from, say, harvesting said wild growth and claiming it for personal uses?   Late...for Christmas?   To be fair, both have lead to some shaky personal decision making.  Drunk = Lets go swimming in the local pond!  Stoned = Do you think peanut butter and sour cream would go well together?  I'd say they can both potentially be 'harmful', but with weed the only person you could harm is yourself.   Wait, does she not??   Unless shes into that*   [Right...] (http://www.reactiongifs.us/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/wtf_is_that_martin_freeman.gif)   Cletus   I dropped a quarter. Yup, I dropped a fucking quarter. I was at bagel store paying the last dollar in change, I like to give exact change if I can. I dropped the quarter, picked it up, hit my head on the counter on the way up. I imagine someone knocking themselves out by hitting their head on a counter probably looked pretty funny from a third person prospective, but it wasn't nearly as humorous from mine. A few moments later I woke up and was driven to the hospital by one of the girls that worked there. I insisted that I was fine but apparently it wasn't up for debate (I think the very grumpy owner was worried about getting sued). As we crossed an intersection about half way to the hospital the back of her car got hit by a speeding driver. As it turns out, this guy was a pretty hard core drug dealer. He had a metric SHIT TON of weed, cocaine and other drugs I haven't even heard of in his car. As compensation for the damage and agreeing not to call the cops, he gave the bagel girl $6,000ish in cash, and me $1,500 for going with it I guess. There was a giant nug of weed between one of her little stacks of money, not sure if that was an accident or not. Anyhow, we didn't go to the hospital I just said we should go get her car fixed. We're still very close friends today. The drug dealer gave her his number in case he didn't give her enough money (which was absurd, her whole car wasn't worth that much). That ended up having it's own impact on our lives too. Not even necessarily in the way you'd expect, we kind of know him now, he invites us to a lot of parties.  EDIT: Reading this over makes me realize my life could have been a lot more boring.  **TL;DR Dropped a quarter in a store, bent down to pick it up, knocked myself out on the counter on the way up, got driven to the hospital by a worker, her car got hit by a drug dealer on the way there, he gave us a lot of money to not call the cops and for the damage, still know them both pretty well today and have a pretty good party story.**   17 (I think). I drank half of a smallish bottle of rum (as I was told was the customary amount) and ended up stealing a probably very expensive but rather small ice sculpture, climbed a street light, accidentally marched in a gay pride parade, and then returned half of the ice sculpture and a case of bottled water. I'm told who ever owned the sculpture didn't share our sense of humor. I didn't stick around to see for myself. Didn't puke though! Saved that for the second time.   You would love Ruth's Chris.   Chinaman  Asian-American  EDIT: Sorry, thought this was *favorite* political correctness.   even when he'd do terrible things (killing his own brother comes to mind)  Really? *That's* what comes to mind??   Go to kids sports games with friends and sit really really far away so we don't piss off the parents. Then we announce the game as if it is a professional level event, developing elaborate back stories for the players as we go. We end up cheering for both teams, as well as cheering against both teams (not loud enough for them to hear obviously). Chants and songs have been developed for each team, and even a few players. Celebration dances and typical sporting event crowd nonsense (the 'wave' for example) are also included. We've even gone as far to ask the kids for autographs and fist bumps after the games. They just think it's awesome, and the moms tend to be too naive to suspect anything. Everyone has a good time.   As a son of over protective parents, I feel I should stress the importance of not being overbearing. Not something you have to worry about anytime soon, but especially for when they get to be 13-18. My parents were crazy, they put parental controls on everything (computer, TV, phones, etc.), they didn't allow dating, I couldn't stay out past 9:30 and I couldn't see friends on weekdays. It was incredibly embarrassing and just encouraged me to become increasingly secretive and sneaky. I've seen it over and over again, families that are run by strict parents don't encourage trust. Don't make the same mistakes. I know it's a long way down the road, but something to keep in mind.   Ah, the usename makes sense now.   Nailed it.   "Dude, all of these names are taken"  "Just stop, man"   ...did I miss something in season 3?!   The end of Dance with Dragons.   You know what they say, great minds will get you burned alive and dabble in psychological torture.   I'm sorry, had to log on just to call complete bull shit on that. Your first time might have been awesome, but it *definitely* doesn't have to be anywhere near the best you can expect. I can clearly remember my first two times, and neither of them were anything special. In contrast to yours, it just goes to show that every time is different. There are a ton of factors that could go into why it wasn't the same, but you're tolerance probably isn't one of them. It may have gone up marginally since the first time, but not enough to make that big a difference.  I would recommend next time you do it in the early/middle day. That would leave you better rested and make it easier to resist the urge to go to sleep when it comes and go do something fun instead. fatmenareepiccooks was actually right though about indicas causing sleepiness in perticular, I would try a sativa if you could get your hands on it.  Every method is slightly different too. Somking, edibles, vaping, dabbing, etc. are all different in their own ways. Edibles tend to be more intense and longer lasting, I personally like them better, but you could easily have an equally good-even better-experience another way, say smoking. I would also try it with other people, that's usually more fun. Just do your own thing though and don't take any thing anyone says too seriously (including me). In the end everyone is different, so go try everything out by yourself and don't be deterred or motivated based off of what people say on the internet. Good luck!   Varys, Ned Stark, Stannis Barathron, Hot Pie (not even kidding), Khal Drogo, Arya Stark, Bronn, Davos Seaworth, Margery Tyrell, Syrio Forel and Joffrey Baratheon.  In contrast, they missed: Daario Naharis (both times), Jamie Lannister, Theon Greyjoy, Mance Rayder, Renly Baratheon, Meera/Jojen Reed, every single Sand Snake and all of the characters they left out but shouldn't have.  Not that all the characters they missed were necessarily worse, or bad even, but they were very different from the versions GRRM had laid out in the books.   It didn't work.   Woah, how did you still find this?   Lots of people quit watching the show because they hate getting attached to characters just to see them die. I've been pretty on board with it though, I like how it makes the show more realistic, the good guys don't always win. That being said, I would be so done with this shit if any of that happened.  EDIT: After thinking about it, I think we can discount this one. Azor Ahai is supposed to have some sort of ancestral link to the Targaryens, which Jorah obviously doesn't. The only two *real* contenders are Dany and Jon, no matter how you try and look at it.   Fuckin' Olly   I think Balon's was more of a "Quick! They're not looking, grab what you can!"  EDIT: Some of the comments regarding comparisons to World War II, ISIS and renaissance era diplomacy have taken this comment way too seriously...   You left out a few:  * Trystane Martell: I don't think he will have a *huge* roll in the next season, but they wouldn't have taken him along for the ride if he wasn't going to make a few appearances. Maybe another trial by combat volunteer like Oberyn? Maybe they'll find someone else for him to marry up in Kings Landing? His little story line is very uncertain, but he'll almost certainly be back.  * Jorah: There's a good chance he either dies, or cuts off his arm this season. I don't see him cutting it off, they already did that whole thing with Jamie. He could survive without cutting it off, but that only happens very rarely. Either way, he'll have a rough time on his road trip with Daario, and I wouldn't be shocked if he didn't make it through the season.  * Arya: She regains her sight after she kills the guy on the docks like she was supposed to. In the books that what happened, accept her blindness was a part of the training, not a punishment. Either way she eventually gets it back and becomes a near fully trained faceless man by the end of the season. Maybe even hitches a ride back to Westeros with Dany.  * Lady Stoneheart: I feel like GRRM wouldn't bring her back unless she was pretty important. I'd love to find out what that important thing is in season 6/Winds of Winter. What ever this 'thing' is though, I think we can guarantee it's very revenge based. S6E9 anyone?  * Stannis: I personally think he's dead. On the off chance I'm wrong though, he could make a big difference in the story line. He doesn't have an army though, so he wouldn't have to team up with or join someone that does.  * Davos: I love him as an honorary member of the nights watch. He really has no where else to go at this point. I hope they don't abandon the story line though.  * Jon: I know you covered Jon, but I can't imagine them holding on to Jon's body for 10 episodes. They are going to burn him, but and either hes dead, or he'll walk out of the fire like Dany with a little help from Mel. Him and Dany supposedly have similar ancestory after all, it's not a stretch to expect they'll both be 'reborn' in the same way.  * Bran/Rickon: Not sure why they missed a season, I guess they're story is a little slow. I really want them to be in the opening scene. Anyhow, major potential spoilers: [Season 6/Winds of Winter] (#g "In the books, Bran can see back in time using weirwood trees. There is a theory that Bran will discover Jon's parentage this way, since Rhaegar and Lyanna were supposedly very conveniently married in secret under a weirwood tree. I think this will be the way R+L=J will be revealed, assuming it does. Rickon, Meera, Hodor and that other girl whos name I forget will go down to Castle Black to deliver the news. Mostly because it would be very boring for them to stick around in the same place all season, and someone needs to tell Jon. I think this is likely because they need a way for Bran to stay engaged in the story. If this, or something else pretty major, doesn't happen, he'll just be sitting around watching everyone else but not actually interacting at all.") I wanted to block that just because it would be pretty huge if it turned out to be correct.  * Uncle Ben: They put up too much hype around him for him not to show up eventually. That might not be season 6 though, they could push it all the way back to 7 if they wanted. Still, I think we're closing in on his grand appearance. He could very well be an ice zombie by now though. Some people think he would be a white walker, but that only happens to the ones that were taken and raised from birth. And it seems very unlikely that he survived north of the wall for that long.  * Cersi: She has something wrong with her foot and everything goes down hill for her from there. It was said that 'Jamie was born holding Cersi's foot in his hand'. Having Jamie's hand cut off and Cersi's foot somehow injured would be pretty symbolic. And Qyburn said something about her injured foot at the end of season 5. Either way, she's completely and utterly defeated leaving Tommen and Jamie to run Westeros on their own. She might kill that nun though.  * Robin: Everyone's favorite brat gets to come back with Littlefinger. That's gonna suck. He might end up marrying Sansa eventually too, if Ramsey dies. I assume his time becoming less of a bitch has been slightly transformative for him, but not enough for him to be the least bit likable.  * Sam: He and Gilly and Sam go down to Oldtown where he gets a probably dull but potentially interesting story line involving how he becomes a maester. We get to see Oldtown, yay! He comes back to castle black by the end of the season but leaves Gilly and Sam in Oldtown for safekeeping.  * Hot Pie: Stories of his kidney pie and wolf cookies spread throughout the Seven Kingdoms. In every great hall, songs are sung about how he didn't give up on the gravy, and how he got his hands on a good bottom round steak despite the ongoing war. His new found fame has made him the lands first celebrity chef. His new restaurant, 'Cuisine de Tartes Chaudes', has a wait list that goes back ten months, you need to know someone to get in. He regularly caters to exclusive events, such as Clegane Bowl I and the Purple Wedding. His new book 'Unburnt, Unbraised, Unbroiled, How a Visionary from Flea Bottom Changed the World of Cooking' is highly anticipated, and is said to be coming out some time after The Winds of Winter. He's writing as fast as he can.   Best Game of Thrones party tricks.   Neither have fucked a bear, but probably not for lack of trying.   You know nothing.   [The real reason they didn't show Stannis and his epic blaze of glory.] (http://imgur.com/g5PwozI)    Chuck Testa   Would you rather have nothing? Because there is/was no other way to do it.   He doesn't speak of having any association with the lord of light until he [ADWD] (#b "is on his death bed"). At that point it seems as if he desperately needs someone to pass on the information so he brings it up. The people he tells just think he's crazy at that point, it's just for the dramatic irony. Personally though, I believed he was right. I can't explain why, just the way GRRM had it play out in the books.  EDIT: Actually now that I think about it, Ameon has talked about it in events prior. I still think he's a more reliable source considering Mel's inconsistency.   I think he said he had a three way with a married couple he met on OkCupid when he was a crazy 19 year old. And then he said he said he was currently 20.   That's awesome.   "Once in a blue moon"   I was expecting something like "I'm 34 now". For all we know dude, that could have happened yesterday.   I'm so conflicted about giving you an upvote for the best possible answer to this question, or a downvote for one of the most messed up things I've ever heard.   Could we at least substitute it with 'that's what she said'?   They absolutely are, did you even read the books? Why do you think Jon is dead? Or Arya is blind? Or Cersi confessed? Of course there are some major changes, but the show still follows the general path GRRM has laid out, especially with regards to major events.   1. Varys is the master of secrets and his little birds 2. A popular fan theory concerns the mother of Jon 3. Joer is the father of Jorah, who used to trade slaves 4. An infamous disease is greyscale, which in the show is currently infecting Jorah 5. Ramsey Snow was legitimized by his father 6. Jeyne Pool was substituted by Sansa in the show 7. Qyburn is not an actual maester 8. The first city Daenerys visited was Qarth   I don't think there is any reason to be 'three', and I honestly don't even see any signs pointing in that direction other than the sidgle. If they wanted Aegon to be in the show, they would have introduced him already. And what reason is there for him to be the 'ice representative' (feels funny to say it like that)? In the books there is nothing to support that.   [ADWD] (#b "If this goes by the books I think we can go ahead and dis-confirm this. Before dying I think Ameon said something like "Melisandre was wrong, Stan isn't the chosen one, Dany is". There is obviously a decent chance it might not go by the books, but that would be a pretty huge thing to change between the two story lines.")   Wishful thinking. As much as I would love to see that, the one other time they tried a flashback it really fell flat. Especially as a season opener. It also seems like way too big of an event to put into the opening minutes of the first episode. I mean book readers have been waiting for years and years for this, and it's going to happen five minutes into season 6? I couldn't imagine it going down that distastefully.   Holy shit it might just be me but that actually seems like a lot. How much was in each bag?   Instantly. Literally before you even knew it.   Well the stregenth of gravity is inversely proportional to it's distance from it's source, but it will never reach zero. That means that yes, us humans are effecting the gravitational strain on literally everything that has mass, including black holes.  This however is really only significant on a mathematical level. The amount of gravitational influence we would give off to such a huge object so far away would be as close to none at all as you could get.  Most galaxies in fact have a super massive black hole at their center. Ours does. It acts similarly to the Sun in our solar system, but on a much much larger scale.  The Sun is pulling towards us gravitationally, but we are in an orbit because we also have inertia. Think about it, if it was *only* the Sun's gravity we would be pulled right into it. Instead our own momentum keeps us orbiting the Sun.  We don't orbit in a perfect circle because the momentum could almost never be perfect enough to allow for such a thing to happen, regardless of other forces pulling on us. There really is no such thing as a perfect circular orbit.  Theoretically any black hole could gather the entire mass of the universe. Lucky for us, the black hole would probably decay before swallowing up everything. Although the universe is not yet old enough for it to happen yet, black holes will eventually die out. Despite how ridiculously long their lifetimes are, I doubt one would be able to collect all of the mass of the universe before fading away.  If it did somehow achieve this though, it probably would not explode. Nothing can escape a black hole, not light or even an explosion. Even if something was to explode inside the black hole, it wouldn't be able to even effect anything on the outside. It probably wouldn't recreate the Big Bang.   Spaghettiception.   I hate to break it to you, but yes.   They can decay theoretically, though the universe is not yet old enough to even come to the end of a black hole's life.   They can decay theoretically, though the universe is not yet old enough to even come to the end of a black hole's life.   A black hole is as large as it's apparent horizon, not it's event horizon. A black hole the size of a baseball would have an even horizon much much further away.   I'm not sure where you go that from. The center of the Earth has no gravitational pull. It slowly becomes stronger as you move towards the surface. Once you get there it slowly recedes again as you move away into the atmosphere. The 'source' is the consolidation of it's mass. It pulls you towards it's center because that is it's central most point of mass.   I saw an opportunity and I jumped on it.   You could obviously never get that close to the event horizon in the first place with out being sucked in. That was just an example.   The size of a black hole is not the size of its event horizon. The black hole itself is the mass that makes it up. It's event horizon is the point at which that masses gravitational pull overcomes the force of light.  The very definition of singularity is it's so small it cannot become smaller, yet your argument is based off of making a black hole smaller? Shrunk to the size of a nickel? He was speaking in theory, it's not possible.   Your nerves would eventually become disconnected, but I would think  up until that point it would probably hurt. I mean imagine your hand falling off one atom at a time within a minute. You're loosing big chunks of hand at a time, that cant possibly feel great.  In the end, no one has experienced it, and even if they did they wouldn't live to talk about it, so we'll never know. It would probably happen rather quickly though.   There is so much that would kill us before we got to the black hole, this is just a 'what if'.   It would probably be doomed to fail. If we could harness the energy of just gravity, our energy crisis would be solved!  Many believe black holes *are* wormholes and that if you were to somehow survive the journey into one you would come out in another part of the universe or even in a different universe all together. This is all theory though, it would be impossible to prove.   It would happen with both. The singularity leaves no survivors. Once you pass within the event horizon you are exposed to roughly the same gravity no matter the size of the black hole, to an extent of course.   If it's in your pocket, than your already well with it's event horizon though... What point does that make supporting what you're saying?    Well we could be sucked towards a black hole before reaching the event horizon, that just the point at which we wouldn't be able to escape.  But yes, one could pull us without destroying the planet. As long as the gravitational pull is strong enough to overcome that of the sun and the inertia of the Earth's orbit, but not strong enough to suck us in, we would be pulled off of our orbit.  That applies to anything that has a gravitational pull though, not necessarily a black hole.  	102
       so. In many movies or tv shows (Buffy comes to mind) vampires lose their souls upon turning. A take i dont really like. That would make turning into a vampire totaly...meaningless.. Since you would just wake up after death in heaven/hell/whatever while your body walks around still on earth! Just a thought...lol..   Good question!                            Heck yeah! This was a great video!            Im kind of experimenting, hence the warning. Lol.    Now i remember! Played that long ago lol   Yeah it does kind off :)   Blue pages?        	22
 Delicious uranium   I disagree with /u/Pewpewonme, I do not think your job is easy.   But FOH falls within the realm of hospitality. BOH is artisinal in nature.   And sorry to say, but you don't really *make* anything. You contribute to the atmosphere of a restaurant.   As far as that goes, there are college majors in hospitality. It would be silly to write anything exclusively on "serving" or "waiting tables". Why? Be nice, smile, always check back on your tables two minutes after they get their food etc...  The things that make your job difficult are stress and memory, and things that contribute to your success are largely people skills. There could be other things, especially in super fine dining, as specific knowledge of wines / beers / ingredients.  All of the above is a part of hospitality. So you could start there...

Hey, you like what you like.  I go with rare steaks, blue rare is too difficult to eat for me.   haha I don't know.   Apparently blue-rare falls between 115 - 125 f. At that temperature, it's basically raw with a sear.  I've personally never experienced anyone who requested anything lower than that. Though, there was one regular who would order his steak 'pitsburg style.' And the specific way he'd like it was for us to  "throw it in the coals for a few seconds and then give it to me. " So there's that.  Also consider that 115 f is  45 degrees over room temperature. Anything under might resist a proper sear... who knows?! hopefully someone else. The steak would probably look something like [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsF1G1sGr-g)   Well, first and foremost: seek therapy.  Seriously, you feel as though it's harming you. Get professional help.  But since that's not always an option for everybody...   What are you insecure about? Your looks, actions etc... After you isolate what you are insecure about, start taking proactive steps towards adjusting your mindset.   I think it's important to realize that you aren't going to wave a wand and all of your insecurities will evaporate. It's normal to be insecure in certain situations, that's just part of being an ape with a crazy imagination. You're also not going to feel better immediately.   Changing your outlook is an organic process, you need to gain the experience while growing. You could spend 48 hours reading about how to play a guitar, and not be able to play it at all. You could spend 48 straight hours practicing guitar, and still suck. But if instead you spent 48 days playing guitar 1 hour a day, you are likely to have better knowledge and skill at the guitar.    It sounds corny, but it's just down to hard work. Don't allow yourself to ruminate, try not to sweat the small stuff.   It's all I can give you   "I would like a steak please."  "Ok great. How would you like that cooked?"  "I'll take it blue-rare please."  "Ok awesome, I'll put that right in."  [ticket prints in the kitchen]  "fire a steak blue-rare."  "heard."    In my casual glancing at this sub, I've found that it's become filled with:  * people who have cleaned their kitchen properly * people who haven't cleaned their kitchen properly * people who have gotten slammed last minute * [insert some artisanal assertion here] that will later be derided by people with a more corporate attitude toward food service.  I still like it, and I'm still subscribed because I like trading/reading stories with people in the business.      Ah yes, let's spin up an epiphenomenal crisis, offer vague solutions and then go back on every word of it.  She's basically just yelling "I'M NOT A REPUBLICAN SO VOTE FOR ME!"   And the sad part is that a large portion of people are going to fall for this bullshit.   It's incredible, the older I get the more political theater begins to resemble vaudeville. I wonder if this is because of the same rinse and repeat nonsense each and every election cycle or is the disingenuousness of politicians just becoming so overt that we come to expect the shit they feed us so they don't even bother labeling it otherwise.   drink massive amounts of coffee and design websites   hi it asked me for my ss twice already, should I put it in a third time or is this something you're still working on?   you might be surprised at how easy it is to dox someone once you get a few seemingly unrelated threads of information.   ah, sorry about the confusion. From the context I read it, it just seemed like you were saying that the kids don't need anything extra.   Yeah, i can see that. I find that parents tend to use the word need reflexively towards their own children, and at times sarcastically or often in a humorous way.   eh, approximately 44k, which is more than double minimum wage afaik.   Where are you at 65-80k? 40k is a livable wage, depending on where you're living. Boston, New York, San Fran, yeahh? Portland, fucking absolutely. Chicago, sure.  It also depends on you're quality of live? Let's assume 50k is dead of the line middle class. What exactly are you doing with that slightly upper middle class margin?   And more importantly, why do you feel that you need tha slightly upper middle wage to be considered earning a livable wage? Owning a house, having kids etc?  Some people don't see those as qualities required for thier standard of living.   An on-and-off swanky bachelor, 45k- 55k should be more than enough. edit: **to live comfortably**   just tell them that the next time they call you you'll cancel service and feel better about it. To put you on the no call list immediately.  And if they call you up again, tell them that you're cancelling because of above statement. And when they try to keep you, ask for a promo   It's this kind of aggressive response that blows my mind about parenting and parenting culture.   Louis C.K. has a bit related to this, only he's talking about people who hit thier kids and others that encourage hitting kids.  Which obviously you aren't saying.  First, I doubt he believes that his children literally need Nickelodeon. He probably means that if he's going to pay for it, might as well pay for something to keep the kids entertained as well.  But even on top of that, what exactly are you implying? That, above the basic necessities they get a whole pile of jack shit? It just seems like an insane way to run a family unit, and a poor attitude to pass on.    " In theory there is no difference between theory and practice. In practice there is."   When I quit smoking, I just started saying "I'm going to step outside for a minute."  No one seemed to care, we're all in it together. Though I do tend to take less breaks now than my smoker colleagues, it doesn't really matter. Next to nobody takes more than 2 minute smoke breaks when it's anything but dead slow.   yes, I am looking to spend tens of thousands of dollars for amateur hobbyist kind of stuff.    why? because then you know he likes women?   Seriously, I don't understand... I know that it sounds like I'm intentionally being dickish. But if you go over your friends house to play video games and you see a model in underwear on his desktop you get... uncomfortable? Like as in, you don't know what to say? Or you feel bad/sad/something? inadequate?   I mean, I don't subscribe to displaying sexy women on my walls and or desktop. But strictly speaking, I don't subscribe to putting anything on my desktop, and think it's a sin for you to have anything more than a solid color. And the color better not be too crazy.  But I digress, I could understand awkwardness if you went over to a friends house and he had -- as his desktop background -- Stoya taking a big fat cock up her ass. Even more so if it were a perfectly looped gif.  But aside from being a straight male and liking women, I also think that there is an aesthetic wonderfulness of a women's body (not to say that the male figure is unpleasing).   What if your friend had a small paper weight replica of something like [this](http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/images/h2/h2_52.11.5.jpg), or perhaps [this](http://www.decodingtheheavens.com/blog/image.axd?picture=2010%2F6%2F399px-Obese_woman-Louvre-CA968bis_mg_7494.jpg). Would that still be awkward?  Do you get awkward when you go to museums?     without holding on to the railing.  easy there buddy    hey bro, if it goes down it goes down. Maybe you can make a casualAMA about it    Me too, it's a bit cathartic and a bit of an exercise in letting go. I spend so much time being nervous about things, but on an airplane it's like "well if this fucker goes down, rip in peace me!"   Something isn't working correctly. I tried on chrome and firefox and I can't see anything happening to the tablet.  Other people are pointing it out and getting downvoted?   What browser/OS are you using?  The tablet rotates on the y axis following the cursor.  Oddly enough, it works on I.E. for me. Also my windows version of safari,   http://youtu.be/1sHyXqkPkkc?t=54s   Let's make it happen   That was my first thought as well    sweet find man!   fucking awesome   honestly, I don't mind working 40 hours a week at something I enjoy.  I have my time split up between working in a restaurant and freelance web development. If I could make it without the restaurant check, I would gladly put more than 40 hours a week into web dev.   I don't even *hate* the restaurant that much, it's just a mild 30/hr wk inconvenience that pays my rent.   did you use a sealer?   The only thing I can find that actually uses jQuery is the staticscraper, which appears to use cheerio internally.  Seems like a bizarre decision to require it for one method of one part of the program.   But it otherwise looks pretty fucking awesome, so there's that.   I think we can all agree that the pot salad blob was a bad idea.   I don't believe that people in Portland should dress up in costumes on a daily basis.  But that belief doesn't change a whole lot, unfortunately.    Heh peepshow reference.  Love that show   I would subscribe   This comment actually scares the shit out of me, because a lot of people think like this.   You just equivocated spanking with evil violence, and the use of which on your own child as cowardly and completely indefensible.   Now let's just define some terms.   The act of spanking involves tapping someone on the bottom and applying light to medium force. The force should not be so hard as to leave a bruise, swelling or extended redness.  Now, I would define evil violence as something along the lines of something heinous and radically counter intuitive to human life.   Examples of committing acts of the above nature are -- tragically -- happening in the in the world today. Subjugation, genocide, torture, war ans so on.   So, if you don't like spanking don't use spanking. If you want to evangelize your anti-spanking stance, please  by all means do.   BUT if you want people to take you seriously, don't imply spanking is like committing genocide.     nice, I think I'll enter this year   oh wow.   You'll probably be downvoted. But I agree wholeheartedly.      jesus   where did you register it if you don't mind me asking?    what could you possibly expect out of an answer for this?   So my question is along the lines of this:  When we say, "species x is impossible to domesticate!" Do we mean to say something along the lines of, "species x is completely impractical and too hard to domesticate!"  I wonder because it seems absurd to say that it would be impossible to mold something into something else from a generational standpoint.   Admittedly, I don't know enough about it to talk intelligently. But I think that plants would be at least slightly analogous to animals as far as domestication is concerned. Animals being more complex would present more variables and therefore take longer.   But I would imagine that it took more than a few generations of humans to produce the domesticated plants that we have today.   So why wouldn't we be able to have a domesticated zebra in 120 years time? If somebody (edit: multiple sombodies, at least) *reallly* wanted to do it, I would bet my money that they could do it.  Just sayin. Humans are pretty awesome, we fly through the air in metal birds and talk to millions of people with a series of tubes.   stop! It's sivatime.   came here to post this. what a bunch of bullshit   oh my god I finally found him      more than that most likely   It looks like it might have even come through that space in between the wall and floor and not the door.     and grandmasters know the exact moves they will make 10 moves in advance because everything follows a flowchart.  quit spreading bullshit around    Can I have an intelligent conversation about the technologies and concepts involved in the position that they are trying to fill?  Most of the time this is yes.  Thank you, It helps just getting nudged in a direction. I guess I just need to push myself into sending out resumes / setting up interviews.   It depends on what server side language you are running. You could be running something with PHP, Node, Ruby on Rails, Python or many others.   It seems like you want to use Ruby on Rails. Do you have the environment set up?   Take a look at [the getting started docs](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html) for some general guidance.  Then, **the very basic** strategy is to   * send the JSON data to the server * take JSON data server side and update database * send response from server with whatever updated information you would like to send back     Two things first:   http://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/2b2u38/ive_just_noticed_a_pretty_big_security_flaw_with/   Rundown:   /u/smokedoutraider discovers that namecheap sends GET data with usernames and passwords in plain text.   "HOLY FUCKING SHIT, that's incredible," is what everyone should be thinking. Inside the thread several people defend this as Namecheap's Community Manager says that they're working on it.   The phrase "junior dev" is tossed around as an argument against incompetence and in favor of somebody just not knowing any better.   **THEN**, earlier    http://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/2b1u4h/2_hours_ago_we_came_up_with_an_idea_for_a_new_app/   Here, I don't even know. Some guys getting drunk at a pub think it's a great idea to make an app to tell them what clothes to wear instead of the temperature and current state of the precipitation outside.  This thread was negatively received. I personally think along these lines: "making things is (almost) always better than not making anything." But I understand a lot of the grief in the thread. Still, their website was very amateur and the developers seemed naively enthusiastic.    **Alright,**   Where do I apply to get into a junior position?   I have been freelancing on and off for over three years. I have a day job that doesn't involve writing code or making websites. I'm now at the point where I split my time as 30 hours/wk day-job, 30+ hours/wk freelancing. I have some stuff up on github, hang around stackoverflow occasionally, try to contribute to open source projects when I can...  But I don't have a college degree. And then I read that it's acceptable in some people's minds that a junior dev can send GET data containing plaintext passwords, or that a "group of developers" believe they can get people to do the ground work of their UX design for free.   The few job listings for front-end devs I see scare me away. Every time I work up the nerve to start looking, I get half-way through the requirements and become discouraged.   "Strong Computer Science Background and/or five years experience in the field." Seriously, what junior dev has that? I went to school for Comp Sci and more than half of the students that did graduate didn't have a "Strong Computer Science Background."  I think that I would have something to add to a company and would really like to start working with/learning from people in the same field.  **In short,**  Developers currently working in the field, what advice would you have for someone looking to get their foot in the door? What would you expect/look for in a junior developer?   About a year ago I cracked a molar on the right lower side.   Recently, it's been a bit intense when eating / drink cold stuff.   I just looked at it in my mirror with a little led pen light and noticed that there's a decent sized black dot where I would imagine the root begins... It's not completely black like some of the horror show images I've been looking at.  But I have been feeling on and off sick for the past week and a half: headache, nasally, one side of throat a tad sore and just run down.  I don't have any insurance, so is this something that needs immediate attention? Like don't go to work today? Or can I call on monday (because that's when the clinic hours are)?   Sorry, I know this post sounds naive, I just wanted some outside opinions before I go running somewhere with wads of money that I don't really have.   Hmm, now that's interesting. Don't you think that we would just make a leap of interpretation and say something like   "geo- of or relating to the earth." where "earth" is to be interpreted as soil, rock etc.   That way it would be understood that the geology of the martian surface would be the study of the planet's composition.    Although awesome, it seems a bit silly to have to have a specified name for every object that existed outside of the earth.   I went to one of these in San Diego... I hated it. I panic ordered every drink and instead of ending up with what I wanted, I ended up with an odd mixture of booze and beer.   Once, while working in the kitchen, I got into a 2 and a half hour long argument with a fellow cook about whether self-driving cars will become a primary sorce of transportation in the next 50 years.   Towards the end it had degraded into   "YES THEY WIL--"  "NO THE--"  "YES TH--"  bartender: "both of you need to shut the fuck up!"   sorry, wrote it on my phone.   I need money like you wouldn't believe.  So in debt, owe a friend who I barely knew at the time (still not as much as I'd like) a ton of money... but the moment my employer pulled some guilt trip on me like this...I'd be looking for a new job.  Hey, I don't want to come across as a dick or anything. But my biggest fear in life is being unemployed and broke. The second biggest is  drowning in debt.   I would much rather eat a little shit from an employer than be in either of those positions.  **EDIT**   Reading through these comments, it seems to me that a lot of people here are not familiar with what it is like to be solely responsible for your living situation. It's possible that this is due to the younger user base of reddit, but who knows. I'm by no means 'old', but I am truly on my own. I live thousands of miles away from **any** of my family and live in a major metropolitan city.  Look, it's like this:  I have a certain standard for my quality of life. I want to have a place to live, food to eat and to be able to enjoy myself from time to time. Even if you have $5,000 to $10,000 in savings -- which is still not a lot of money -- six months of unemployment begins to get very dire.   Rent, phone bill, laundry, electricity, transportation, internet, clothes and food are all expenses. Sure not all of of them are essentials, but as you start cutting them out you become less competitive and more withdrawn. This is just a fact of the modern world.  And yes, you can turn your back on almost all of these things and still be alive. But being a gutterpunk, crustpunk, homeless person is simply not something that I want to do.    Yeah, I get it. I'm "part of the problem" blah blah blah. How many of you pointing this out would be willing to put yourself into a dire situation to prove/fight a flaw in the system?   There is no magic escape plan for a lot of people, where "uh oh I can't pay my rent this month" turns into "okay you have 1 month the get the fuck out of my apartment complex."   So yeah, I actively let the man beat me down at times. I'm not saying it's right or just. I just want my apartment, my phone, food, internet electricity and to be able to go out for drinks on the weekend. Sorry guys!   I don't understand the context of your comment, but it made me laugh.    ah there we go, sorry I skimmed.   Well, I would assume that they include this because the mice were given much more cinnamon than is commonly ingested for an animal that size.   I didn't see a dosage size in the article though...   That actually made me fucking laugh.   He's obviously very frustrated.    What do you feel is inflexible about Bower? I ask because a)I use it quite often and it never gives me any trouble but b) would be open to new solutions, if only for the sake of seeing what else there is being offered.   Personally I think bower works really well. Just a simple, intuitive command line tool.  I also don't understand what you mean by lightweight?    A person who must rely on public transportation is viewed as unreliable and a possible liability by most companies.  I don't see how this would be a problem in many cities.   Trains often run faster during high traffic volume and when there isn't time to take a train or bus just hop in a cab.   I can't imagine being discriminated against in NYC, Boston, or Chicago for relying on public transit.   If you're living outside of a city, or in a smaller city surrounded by the suburbs... Well, of course you need a vehicle. But Major cities? A lot of times it makes sense to just take public transportation.   Look into exchange and study abroad programs.   You'll need your parents to ok it.   Not to mention, dropping fuck cunt and shit in every sentence will get you nowhere fast.  Eh, depends what you do for work. I've worked places that have been so crass you need to start making up new swears so they still have meaning.   You shitbagcuntfucker.    Look into the three quarter sleeve.   For interviews you can wear the long sleeve button down and roll up the cuffs about half forearm length.    How old are you? If you're in high school, take a drama class and/or get involved with after school drama. If your school doesn't offer anything like that, look around for community theaters. Usually (but not always) these put on very low-stress productions and will get you used to being on stage.  If you're past high school age, then your best bet is probably to do the same with the community theater or to find out what's going on in a nearby university / college.   It wouldn't hurt to take some acting classes, you'll meet people who have the same interests and it's a great way to learn the craft and network to find different opportunities.   You could also skim craigslist for people putting on small-time film projects as well. Usually these will be extra-type roles.  Networking and knowing people will be your best friend.   While I agree with your sentiment, I think that what people get upset about is that it presumably takes much more devotion and mastery to get a phD then it takes to become a waffle house line cook.  I'd propose that:  1 - education is important for society and   2 - people are required for providing that education.  I am not surprised that certain people feel entitled to higher wages. I am less surprised that someone who has worked 7+ years at mastering a specific craft feel especially entitled to higher wages.   Sure, you know some people that are doing fine. But there are many many many adjunct professors making 25k/year. And that simply isn't enough money.   So, yeah, I think people should be slightly outraged and entitled. Basically, I fucking love eating at waffle house, and I think that maybe adjunct faculty would like eating there too. Unfortunately, some can't because they decided that instead of flipping waffles all day, it would be a good thing to teach some people some cool things and probably learn some new stuff in the process.  WHY DON'T YOU WANT PROFESSORS TO EAT AT THE WAFFLE HOUSE?!   what are you so upset about? he's remaking that his friend has a phD, can only afford basic food and lives in looming fear of losing her job.   No special treatment for her.   But as a cook and a freelance web designer -- shit, just as a cook -- I am not going through this much hardship.    They'll just take this away from us soon enough   That's amazing   But then they say "great! Wanna hang out?!"  Oh... uh... I'm doing well, thanks.   Nah   They can sign up to go fight in a war.  I had four people in my small graduating class join the military.  One junior year and three senior year.   At that point, we still had to raise our hands to go to the bathroom.  That's not to say that when I was 17-22 I wasn't a complete idiot.  But to treat young adults as though they are still children -- I think -- is a complete mistake.   I am currently 25. I'm now what's considered to be "an adult." I know that that is still relatively young.  What surprises me most is how much I have to learn but how much I should have spent considering myself capable of making life changing decisions.   I'm still a fucking idiot.   That was my guess. But I said in my mind, "so cal?"   5'4"... I uh... :(   Dude don't be ashamed of that.  Come to portland or with that shit. You'll be loved.    Wow, you really arn't getting the whole safety thing huh?   This is just more evidence for you to use in support of his Douchebaggery   /r/karmacourt  	85
 Always nice and shiny without a single water spot.    Why do i think i'm going to see the posted all over the place the rest of the day.   Usually they aren't 6 miles deep and 50 miles away from the nearest city.   wait... The top post less than 2 hours old has /u/iBleeedorange commenting on it? Did Earth's magnetic field shift? Usually you are the top of the frontpage and others are commenting on it.    We would have shit galore?      We all are...   SoCal water isn't much warmer, but you do have better beaches.   Water is too cold in NorCal.   Maybe, maybe not.   Where is Cover beach?   This was a pretty shallow quake though, not much to be worried about other than a tsunami wave. According to NOAA data there was just minor movement.    I know and understand. I can see the argument from both sides. Just hope OP and everyone else can learn from what we saw.   Thanks for the kind words stranger.      RIP Eric   /r/justflewintotheshop  Can't believe it is actually real.   Gave it to myself actually.   Why would you act against the grain online, and not care about others finding your point of view offline offensive. You make friends with like minded people, and if they don't agree with you then they aren't friends anyways.   Touche   They can be pretty scary.   I did care, but i've learned not to care what other people think of me. Life is better when you live your life the way you want. Unless drugs are involved, that would probably get me in trouble.   You can have a private life on the internet without commenting. Yes i think anonymity is important as far as what you want see on the net, but why would you need to censor yourself for what you say?   Then why are they your friend?   This is actually a good point. Wonder if there would be a way to get around this.   I'm not worried about what i say, my friends and family know how i stand. Any job that fires me or won't hire me for what i say, i don't want to work there anyways.   Why can't you say what you want without your name attached to the comment?  I can see why if your government will punish you for your free speech.    Radar Detector   I probably have over a million miles driven from Santa Barbara to San Diego. I've had this happen countless times. Amazing how many times i've seen an accident like this happen.     You are absolutely right, wish i saw your comment before i started the same argument up above.   Without the video evidence then yes you would probably be liable for it, if there wasn't a reliable witness involved.   With the video evidence it would still be considered a no-fault accident, and i'm sure the insurance company would sue the PT driver for causing the accident.   Reason why dashcams are needed, wonder what OP's insurance company would say if they saw this video.   What would you do at the 7 second mark of the video if this was you driving?   Thanks for saying what i wanted to say.   The PT cruiser's angle of attack was too steep, it always looked like he was going to keep coming across the lanes.  Couldn't have said it better myself, thanks.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eb4iFLrTeSo   Amazing when you learn how long a plack second is.        Didn't blame the cammer, just said it was avoidable.  Edit - This is probably the first video i've seen on here that i thought was avoidable.    LMFAO only if you really knew me.  Edit - Thanks for the flair   Sounds like too much work, i am lazy.   I agree, but this was avoidable if OP just let of his gas when he saw cars merging ahead of him. At the 7 second mark on the video, i would have started to get into the left lane or let off the gas to see if they stay in their lane.   Pretty sure your insurance would be paying for both vehicles repairs, but it would be considered a no-fault accident.  Then the insurance company would try to sue the PT driver for causing the accident.   If you keep an eye on your mirrors and watch the traffic around you, you can keep a mental map of the traffic around you.  You don't have to predict the future, just don't expect that driver to stay in the lane they are suppose to after merging.   Even if you have video evidence of trying to avoid an accident?   Whenever i see cars merging onto the highway i will do exactly what you said. If i knew there was a car in the lane next to me, i would have let off the gas when i saw the cars starting to merge to avoid OP's situation.   If you keep aware of your surroundings you would know if there was a car there or not. Even so, OP had plenty of time just lay off the gas and coast to slow down when he saw cars merging. Maybe OP was in a zone and not aware of his surroundings.   Pretty sure if he had done this, the PT would have merged in front of him without even having to touch the brakes.  Even so he has video evidence that proves he was trying to avoid an accident.    They probably drive just like OP. Guess growing up in LA traffic has made me more aware of other drivers.   Even just watching the video made me want to slow down seeing the traffic merge. He practically drove into her blind spot.  Don't get me wrong, the PT is completely at fault.   Edit - I will take the downvotes because this was completely avoidable accident.    If OP were to apply the brakes (not slam on them) and make a move to the left lane, that PT wouldn't have hit OP. Why is his first reaction to just honk the horn? If you are a defensive driver you would be letting off the gas and slowing down and ready to hit the brakes moments before OP just honks his horn. OP didn't even try to slow down even after he honks.  Even if there was a car in the next lane that OP hits trying to evade, he has video evidence he was trying to avoid an accident.  20 years of driving defensively i haven't been in any accidents, and have been in OP's situation many times. Don't expect other drivers to be paying attention at all times, especially when they are merging in the lane next to you.   Exactly how i do it. Build it hot then starve it of oxygen. Usually can leave it alone for hours only really having to open vents a lil bit of time to maintain temp.   Well you are the ones with the guns.   Only if you do it in a panic.   hoping the impact might be a bit lighter  OP had enough time to realize what was happening for him to honk his horn, instead of making a controlled maneuver to evade. By the time the other driver has time to realize what the honk was for, OP could have got into the other lane.   Why didn't you try to evade him instead of honking your horn?  Edit - ~~I'm not going to try to argue this anymore~~, this accident could have been avoided if OP was a defensive driver.  edit2 - Just realized that another comment was downvoted to hell for saying the samething.  /u/Malfeasant describes [this perfectly](https://www.reddit.com/r/Roadcam/comments/3ackon/pt_cruiser_owners_are_the_worst_drivers/csbiu80). If any of you have ever ridden a motorcycle you would understand.   lemon stealing whores   She crashed on the other side of the planet...   I'm good at many things unlike you that deletes his pathetic comments.   Edit - like i said, /u/massshootingagain doesn't like to be called out on his bullshit.   He had a plan to go in and shoot a bunch of people and was lucky enough to get away.   I'm white and live in the US and this is terror, domestic or not.     Will see this on /r/conspiracy in a few hours.   Brand new account, just downvote and move on...   Seriously   Anyone that notices this fucktard user "massshootingagain", tag him and fuck his mom.   Anytime there is a crime involved in this magnitude the FBI would either take over the investigation or at least aid with all resources available.   I'm sorry, i am on the border of being drunk. If you were to depend on new comments with gold standards you would still have to filter through all the bullshit trolls.   Even though reddit is great for providing the first info, it all comes from an original source.   For a start, [follow these local stations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_in_Charleston,_South_Carolina#Major_network_television_affiliates) on all social media platforms. Then follow the hashtags would be a decent start.   If you need gold benefits to find new info, then you don't know how to work social media well enough. Not hard to find the breaking news if you know how to find it.   Even if this quote "rifle behind every blade of grass" isn't really made by Isoroku Yamamoto, it speaks the truth.   In 1960, Robert Menard was a commander aboard the USS Constellation when he was part of a meeting between United States Navy personnel and their counterparts in the Japanese Defense Forces. Fifteen years had passed since VJ Day, most of those at the meeting were WWII veterans, and men who had fought each other to the death at sea were now comrades in battle who could confide in each other. Someone at the table asked a Japanese admiral why, with the Pacific Fleet devastated at Pearl Harbor and the mainland U.S. forces in what Japan had to know was a pathetic state of unreadiness, Japan had not simply invaded the West Coast. Commander Menard would never forget the crafty look on the Japanese commander's face as he frankly answered the question. 'You are right,' he told the Americans. 'We did indeed know much about your preparedness. We knew that probably every second home in your country contained firearms. We knew that your country actually had state championships for private citizens shooting military rifles. We were not fools to set foot in such quicksand.'   Worse than a troll if you ask me.   Also live on the west coast and got home to find this thread. Granted i was in the ER an hour before this started.   Could be and i hope we are both wrong.

Mozgov was amazing, my new favorite russian.    Next highest is Eugene, but is just barely over 150k residents. I wouldn't say it was major city. I live in a city on the outskirts of LA county and has roughly the same population.   Reno isn't big at all, maybe he was thinking of vegas?   He knew there was going to be enough video to rewatch it when he wanted to.    Time Cop?   Congrats Warriors, rooted for you after Houston took out my Clippers.

When the rest of the site caught on to what happened, does that content still reach the frontpage today?   Reddit has seriously gone crazy in the last week.

 I messaged the mods earlier about having another bingo game like at Star Wars Celebration - I made a board for it, would you consider it?  http://imgur.com/cJBVoVb      I don't think Arndt ever had a full script, just a story treatment   But it's relevant to this community.   MakingStarWars.net   No, a lot of his leaks have been true before.   My dad, mostly. He was buying Star Wars toys for me even before I was born.   Post it for real so people know it's fake   Don't be a jerk about it, man.   I agree with you on the Family Guy part, but at least the Simpsons writers try. The show might not seem as good as it used to be, but that's really just because it's changed to cater to a more modern audience. Family Guy is literally just beating dead horses and making pop culture references.   Yeah I did that and it worked fine   Please /u/00-----00    I know it is, but that doesn't mean a movie couldn't be coming. McGregor has expressed interest multiple times, so I don't know why Disney wouldn't do it.   Well, unless there is something else that would "break the Internet" like /u/00-----00 said.    I think we all know the movie is coming by now   I think this is pretty realistic. Other than having Gwendolyn Christie and maybe Harrison Ford at SDCC, it's possible that they bring out Ewan McGregor at the end of the panel to announce an Obi-Wan movie. I think this would make up for the absence of a TFA trailer, and they could even show a teaser for the Kenobi movie, similar to what they did with Rogue One at Celebration.   They didn't think to mention "teaser," just trailer or clips.   Ah. It wont let you use the AR function unless you scan that magazine ad that was leaked yesterday.   I think they're saying its going to be on Google Play soon   Nothing's been confirmed as of now, but I bet they will.   Well, 4.5 of those things we know are true   I think it's left to right top, and then right to left bottom.      It was so amazing. If someone had asked me to go back the next night I definitely would have. And I probably would have wanted to go back the night after that, too.   Any good (Photoshop) tutorials on how to do this? All the ones I find are bad and whenever I try it turns out horrible.    Haha you and everyone else   At least he can write well - I'm sure the *idea* of the spinoff wasn't his, but the story certainly will be, and that's a good thing.   Yeah   Kinda sorta, but he would definitely make a better Indy than Han   I definitely don't hate him, but he's too old, doesn't look very much like Han, and really doesn't have that same charmingly arrogant quality that Han has, if you get what I mean.   Definitely Boba Fett, maybe Lando, and maybe Jabba. I'd love to see why Han has Jabba's bounty on his head.   I think anyone with common sense would rather do a Star Wars movie than a Flash movie. If anything, they'll drop out of *that*.   If they cast an unknown actor who can actually *act,* then we'll definitely have something to look forward to.  I hope it's not Chris Pratt.   But he was by Sean Connery   I bet that whoever they cast in this will end up being Indiana Jones as well (but that could never happen, because Indy 5 comes out the same year as this)   Taron Egerton, Ryan Gosling   Yeah but having two movies without the force (as far as we know) isn't any reason to say the studio hates the idea of the force    I'm sure it will be - I don't think they'd do it directly before A New Hope, or else they'd have to cast someone *really* similar looking to Ford   Interesting idea - I can imagine Boba would play some role in this   The next movie coming out literally has "the force" in the title.   And written by Lawrence Kasdan and his son Jon!   Odd choice, but they've done good work in the past - Lego Movie, Jump Street, Last Man on Earth   Pretty nice, though I wish you had done Nimoy as Spock in place of the "Chewie, we're home" part   Why would that ever happen?   It's just as easy as baking a cheesecake   Mm yes FakingStarWars the most believable news source since The Onion   The movie is optional. It's not the worst thing ever, but it's certainly not the best.  The series is great, however. You can either watch it in the order that it was released, or you can watch it in the chronological order: http://m.ign.com/articles/2014/03/18/star-wars-the-clone-wars-how-to-watch-in-the-right-order   John Boyega playing a Stormtrooper   I would. Star Wars is big, and there's no way this information won't get out to the public. Disney would rather put out a video of the panel in high quality than have a bunch of low quality phone recordings.   I think it depends on the studio and the director. I would imagine that JJ Abrams has a lot of control over what's in the Star Wars trailers, while the directors of Marvel movies probably have less input.   As much as I love them, there are *many* other critics who are better than them in terms of actually reviewing films.    I'm a biologist, not an astronomer  I read that in Dr. McCoy's voice   Why would they go to SDCC and show nothing? That is definitely not the place to disappoint.   It looks more like a Japanish one to me   What about the names?   I guess so - I can imagine we might get a plot synopsis, cause Kasdan will be there.   No, it really wouldn't. It gives background information of what's been going on in the past 30 years. It's not like the crawl for ESB mentioned Vader being Luke's father...   *George Lucas   Yeah but I don't see any reason why Disney would put Star Wars in a place where studious usually go all out just to tell a couple of behind the scenes stories and some pictures.   And besides, they don't want Star Wars to be overshadowed by DC if another BvS trailer comes out - they want to be the ones breaking the records for trailer views, not their competitors.    Same with every other person who's claimed to have seen it...   Yeah   That was still a teaser   Really?? That's the movie of his you're saying is bad (which it isn't)?  Not Meet the Fockers? Ishtar?   ITS A TOMATO! A TOMATO DOESNT HAVE LOGIC!!   Now back to 9/11   I don't believe it. Why would they choose not to have a Marvel presence at a *comic* convention? Did they only put Star Wars there for a few behind the scenes videos? Doesn't add up.  At the very least we'll get some new information and a poster, but I wouldn't give up hope on seeing a trailer or a third teaser.   What about D23?   The EW article is in the tumblr page. Actually click the link.   I wouldn't give up hope completely.  Who knows? This might not even be true. At the very least we'll get some new bits of info, and maybe some behind the scenes footage of even a poster.   Sry m8 - just confirmed that there's no trailer at CC whatsoever   Damn it. Well at least we can put all the "leaks" in the garbage bin.   It sounds believable but you have no proof. Some of that is based on rumors, some are just things that one would logically assume. I could very easily make up something like that and have it sound true.  Not saying that it's all BS, but I'm just gonna have to take it with a grain of salt.   Yup - I think they'd rather have an official high quality version than a bunch of shitty phone camera ones   How would your friend who works in VFX know anything about the releases of the trailers, and where Rogue One takes place? I highly doubt what's shown at SDCC will be exclusive to that.   Totally - that and the World's Fair bit were the best parts of the movie.   That's awesome - I've always loved that style of drawing.   I bet Disney will release the whole panel online, too. That's exactly what they don't want, low quality leaks.   Well I would think that Disney would rather have a high quality version come out instead of a million bad-quality phone recordings.   The standalone movie 2 is coming 2018, I'm pretty sure.  I think the release schedule is:  The Force Awakens - Dec. 18th 2015 Rogue One - Dec. 16th 2016 Episode 8 - May 26th 2017 Standalone 2 - 2018 Episode 9 - 2019 Potential Standalone 3 - 2020   No - I think both Kathleen Kennedy and JJ Abrams realize that these new movies can't rely on nostalgic references to older movies. They're trying to get a new generation into the Star Wars world, and if they want to do that, they must put story first, and not callbacks to earlier films that the audience might not understand.   Jenississ   Says the man who starred in *Ishtar*   Uh huh.   Why? They have literally nothing to do with each other.   NO I HATE IT WHEN KIDS INTERRUPT MY VIEWING OF A KIDS MOVIE!!!!    Stop.      Of course it will. It's a *Marvel* movie.   Not that there's anything wrong with that...   Yeah but it's not foreign. Foreign director =\= foreign film. It has a 60.000.000 budget, is being distributed by a major (American) studio, stars American actors, and was filmed in Canada.   The Revenant doesn't really qualify as a foreign film though, does it?   Yub Nub is the shit man   Yeah - a lot of the rumored plot points, like Boyega being a stormtrooper, turned out to be true, even though they were talked about way before they were confirmed to be real.   *July   I think it reads like a trailer. Scenes from the film that gave dialogue about the plot? New character and location reveals? Pretty trailer-ish   It is, but here's my theory as to what happened.  The chocolate was originally wrapped on the outside, but they did it wrong, causing all of them to turn out like [this](http://imgur.com/Ek3DA3K)  So, they unwrapped all of them and closed them the right way, leaving most of them completely unwrapped and some of them partially wrapped in plastic, like [so](http://imgur.com/H9gMiQR)   No, your point is pretty simple. I would literally read absolutely nothing into it   The artists names maybe?   You know that the narration is re-recorded dialogue from Return of the Jedi, right? It's not supposed to mean anything (concerning Vader).   Maybe something to do with the alphabetization of the name?   I think it's pretty clear what it's saying, actually.       Tomorrowland....   I still don't think it's possible to fast forward live television...   It's not out yet... And it's very likely that this is completely fake.   It's still fun to read, even if it's not real...   The Phantom Menace trailer has nothing to do with how good this trailer is. And the director is good, he's shown that he is. All of his movies are well-directed movies.    Probably fake, but awesome nonetheless. It's fun to talk about this kinda thing, even though it might not be real.   The Star Wars prequels are pretty boring in a lot of parts if you think about it - trade negotiations, boring scenes of sitting on couches and talking, stupid dialogue - and those still made tons of money - the same would apply to Jurassic Park (which, by the way, I don't find boring in any part).  	109
 You just made me realize that for all the wheel-chair bound cripple fucks, there isn't a single handicap ramp in all of Yharnam.  Yharnam is a dick to handicapped people!   I tried that trick last night (was using USB becuase PS+/internet were being bitches), and I received one blood rock in 20-30 tries.  Guess RNgeezusmotherfuckeralready hates me :/   Then I got bored, and moved on to a depth 5 dungeon that had the headless bloodletting beast, and I killed him about 15 times, but nothing other than gems and chunks dropped there either :.   Will try again soon I guess.  Thanks for the info.    I'd go something like 25 end, 25 STR and 50 SKL instead, for visceral damage, and because I love the burial blade and the SKL weapons in general, and your LHB can still have an ridiculous AR of 850+ even with a SKL build.  Supposedly the LHB gets slightly more AR out of STR, but the SKL weapons are much more fun imo, and unless you wanted a dedicated STR build, I feel like the SKL version has more versatility.  Either way, the above is what I would use for a skill build, whether or not you wanted to use the OP LHB, and either way the build will still remain competitive.   Yeah, but Evelyn spam builds are the equivelant of magic spam builds from DaS1/2.  I'd rather play the game, but some people think this is fun PvP I guess.  Even more annoying are the people who sit there spamming the shotguns.  That being said, you have to play super patient and let them run out of bullets, but I usually run out of patience and run in, and half the time I die in 2 or 3 hits from the fast rips of their Chikage.  FYI, in the last few days, I don't think I've seen a single BT build outside of reddit dungeon hizzngr.  It's pretty much the meta there, but I hardly see it elsewhere, which is nice.  And it's a shame, because I find BT builds fun to play, just not fun to play with in PvP :D   Were you able to get more than one blood rock from the same boss in the same chalice glyph?  I swear, I killed CE a zillion times, but I only ever got one.  I received a blood rock on my second CE kill, then I killed him another 20 times and didn't see anything, which lead me to believe that you can't get more than one blood rock from a single chalice glyph, but I would love to hear if that is possible.  How many times did you have to kill him to get more than one blood rocks?  One in 25 kills?  One in 50 kills?  Etc?  Thank you.   But being that most PvP fights last 20-30 seconds, there just isn't enough time for more invasions.  I really do miss the 1 v 1 v 1 or the 2 v 2s and etc.   Dude.  Now I want to google bloodborne porn...but I am also kind of afraid to...  I'd be all for hunter vs. doll, but with how weird the internet is, I'd probably find Rom vs. Vicar Amelia or a Snatcher :D   Yep.  I took a break from Bloodborne pretty quickly, whereas I couldn't put down DaS and DaS2 for a minimum of probably 5-6 months each, and even then, I came back for more, and I did it quite often.  And what game did I take a break from Bloodborne to play?  SOFS...and then vanilla DaS2 to do a full playthrough with my brother.  I'm back to playing PvP in BB, and while it's fun, I also find it very...lacking :/   FYI - I went to hizzngr3 last night, and not much has changed - though I got just as much shot-gun spam as I did Evelyn spam, so if anything, it was just more annoying, but the matches seemed to come faster than Nightmare Frontier (with a toon I just pushed up to 120 from 110).  I'm thinking I'll back up my toon, then push him up to 150 to see how I like it.  Thanks for the info so far, and I appreciate your efforts to try to bring up the validity and fun of having a higher level meta to the community.   I think the biggest flaw when it comes to the PvP meta level discussion is that people keep trying to treat this game like Dark Souls 3, but it isn't.  Sacrafice has been important for level metas in the souls games, and it is a very valid point, but this isn't a souls game, and sacrafice doesn't mean much when we intentionally stay low level, yet farm 27% and other max level gems to kill each other in two or three hits anyway (and I don't blame people for staying competitive), but imo these have been the fundamental problems people have been complaining about for months now, as two to three shot PvP in the clunky multi-player system of Bloodborne can grow stale, samey, and the waiting periods to invade/be invaded (even with hunter's marks) usually last longer than the matches themselves.  We can't just go to a dragon or blood bro and summon them like we used to, or use a red orb to invade whereever and whenever we feel like it.   A higher meta gives us more survivability and more build options, and these have been lacking in standard meta Bloodborne PvP.  As for trying to treat this game like DaS3, let's look at what we left behind, and what the argument for a lower meta always fails to address:   nbsp;  Weight/Armor/Poise and all that it entails:  In BB, everyone is a ninja.  There is no sacrafice here, no gear choices, no armor vs. weight, no diversity, no creativity, and no heavy armor, or light armor with better all rounded resists, and no armor with stats or buffs.  What is there in terms of resists is just short of negligible, especially when you consider fashion!   nbsp;  Weapons - We have very few choices, and even less choices when you consider the many who flock to to stay competitive by using the two most easy to OP weapons in the game (LHB and Chikage+eve).  In past games, we had infusions, boss weapons, and all manners of options, but they were never as straightforward and OP as stacking 27% damage x 3.  There was more nuance (aside cheesy metas), but what the hell, eat my 850AR LHB or my 700AR Chikage that swings faster than a dagger!   nbsp;  Movesets (quick vs. strong attack) - Let's be honest.  Movesets don't matter as much when it comes to PvP in this game, as most anything beyond dashes, rolls, or regular quick attacks can be easily punished in so many ways.  Sure, you might be able to sneak in the occasional jump attack or charge attack, or strong attack to mix it up, but there is a reason why people spam fast attacks:  becuase the game and the play-style of it makes it too easy to punish anything else.   nbsp;  Buffs:  There are no survivability buffs, be it through magic, miracles, or items.   nbsp;  Competition and game mechanics:  This goes back to what I've mentioned before and putting it all together:  We have ninja builds with no armor/weight options, no survivability buffs, less HP than ever before (especially when you are the invader), little build variety, and weapons that are easy to make ridiculously powerful, and thus the low level meta is a two to three shot, 20 to 30 seconds PvP match.  I think these are the main reasons so many people come on here to complain that the BB PvP scene is boring, stale, and has less longevity, and oh by the way, they are back to playing DaS2.   As for myself, I've come to prefer matches with healing, as they last longer than 20 or 30 seconds, and are more enjoyable and make for more thrilling fights, and with how slow and clunky multi-player can be, it becomes even more relevant.  If I PvP for a half hour, I'd prefer four or five, three to five minute matches, rather than the commonplace occurrence of eight to ten 30 second matches, with the waiting periods between the matches being longer than the fights themselves.   Edit:  I'd like to add that the two to three shot meta is also kind of frustrating, as your latency test for the other player can put you one swing away from death, and leaves little to no room for experimentation and lag.      But, but, don't people like dying to Evelyn spam plus two hits from a bloody chikage?!  :P   In all seriousness, I am all for build diversity and I love the idea of expanding them, as having all of five builds is pretty lame.  And being that match-making can be clunky and slow, I am all for PvP fights lasting longer than 15-25 seconds.  I think 125 is a good meta.   Bloodborne is a great game to be sure, but I would have been happy with a multi-player system that didn't suck, covenants that didn't suck, and more than four "builds," becuase the lack of options and creativity sucks :/      Says the thousands of people who "hated it," yet still played it longer than any other game of 2014, who played it more than DaS, and who still play it to this day.  The PvP is better and has more longevity than Bloodborne, that's to be sure, and the multiplayer in general is so much smoother and easier :D   If you're gonna talk shit about it, fine, but that's your opinion, but a lot of people still love it, and still play it, and still enjoy it, even if it isn't the best souls game in the souls series (it is still the best RPG in the souls series).   What have you put out into the world, from your own head, for yourself?  Thanks in advance :)   I have that one printed up already.  It's what I've been primarily using the last few weeks, and it's pretty great as well, thank you.  I liked the previous spreadsheet MrBrokewilly posted because it had a lot more details and info about other items and bosses you find within most of the glyphs :D   Ah, ok.  This was one of the questions I was definately more curious about.  Thank you.   Yeah.  I've done that, I usually shoot him to stagger him, then catch up and slap him around like a bitch, but I've had it that the doll puppets get in the way, or I get snagged on a corner, and etc, and the worst of it was a boring circular 10 minute chase :D   I think Micolash was actually a missed opportunity, as the concept is kinda cool ( a maze/puzzle boss), but it wound up lame and annoying as fuck.  It is an extremely easy fight too, but careful, because he might one-shot you.  At low insight, he would just run in circles (often not running into the first room), and occasionally jump through a mirror, and it's just not a fun fight to chase a boss in circles for 10 minutes, and then chase him some more, then have him one shot you, then rinse and repeat, and pwn him the next time around.     Yep.  I think it was a missed opportunity for something even greater (a creepy/puzzle/maze boss), but it wound up clunky, lame, and easy, with the occasional one-shot, which just isn't fun or challenging really, especially if you spent 10 minutes chasing him in circles at low insight :D   I want moar Sen's :D   I'll sacrafice a goat to Chemosh and hope for the best :D   Oooh, thanks!  Will have to try this!   Edit:  also, do you happen to know or remember what the other bosses are off-hand?  Thanks again.   Eh, I don't think this is the same bull-shit cliche of *"it could all or was all a dream,"* as the dreams in this game are as real as the waking world, more akin to another dimension or facet of reality.  It does make things convoluted and obtuse as you put it, but it's nowhere near as trite and obnoxious as the whole *it was all a dream* cliche.   Edit:  And while there is the curious love-craftian mechanic of insight vs. madness, it isn't as fleshed out as it could of or should have been, but at least this is one of the few love-craftian games out there with an actual Lovecraft mechanic in it (so many games miss out on this awesome opportunity).  That being said, I don't think there is much (if any) room for the "madness makes anything possible" idea, because as convoluted and obtuse as everything is, it is still fairly straight forward:  old ones, hunters, queen Yharnam, etc, are so powerful they can maintain consciousness through force of will; there are dream worlds that are as real as the waking world; the great ones exert their influence from beyond them, and the humans in the waking world try to exert their wills on bringing them through, etc.  If anything, my critique of the game is akin to yours - there seems to be quite a few contradiction in items and descriptions (not talking about the general FROM vagueness and connect the dots method, I mean straight up contradictions), and if anything, this story is more straight forward with more given answers than previous titles - I think the one thing that just trips everyone up is how weird it all is, rather than say, the consistency and repetition of fallen kingdoms and fallen gods and heroes that come to supplant them in the souls series.  Your thoughts?   Fire does decent damage on him (oil urns+moltovs, fire papers, etc).   You can throw blood cocktails to distract him for a few seconds (to either heal, use antitodes, or attack).   You definately want a few antidotes on hand in case you get poisoned, as it can drain your HP super quick.   To make it a sure-shot, I'd stock up on the above listed items, then use an insight to summon Alfred, and don't be stingy with your items that way you won't waste half your items and be left without the kill.  Good hunting to you  |o_   That is the sweetest spread-sheet I have seen so far, but it has no info regarding boss blood-rock drop rates, or good dungeons to farm for them.  Thank you though.   Haha.  No sweat.  I don't blame you.  After my next and last toon that still needs to finish the story line chalices is done with them, I will probably never run a story chalice again.  Funny enough, I do enjoy the randomized chalices, as it's fun seeing the monster combos and grouping (and how totally fucking difficult they can be) at times, as well as hunting for loot.   Yeah - dun sweat it.  You'll catch on.  I've been a long time souls player and FROM fan, and after being familiar with all the tropes and secrets that FROM tends to put in their games, I beat this game very quickly (I didn't mean to, nor was I even playing it that much), and I found it to be the easiest and fastest game so far, once I got used to the change of pace/mechanics from previous games that is.  Given more time, you'll wonder how you ever sucked so bad in the first place :P   Yeah, but Destiny is one of the shittiest, shiny turds ever produced :D   FROM games made most action-RPG type games and MMO's feel like hello kitty's island adventure when it comes to combat.  There just isn't enough depth and weight and impact and conservation of movement and resource management to make other game's combat feel as challenging, heavy, and engaging :/   As the title says, I was curious if anyone has had decent luck farming specific chalices for blood rock drops from bosses?  I have probably completed 5 to 10 depth 5 chalices on two different toons each since the patch, and so far, I think I have one blood rock drop for one toon.   That being said, the drop came from a cursed dungeon, and as such, I haven't seen a blood rock drop from a non-cursed depth 5 dungeon boss.  Can anyone else confirm whether or not blood rocks can drop from non-cursed dungeon bosses?     Also, in regards to good chalice codes (ie, quick, easier bosses, etc) to farm blood rock boss drops from, does anyone have codes that also include mobs/bosses that drop other valuable gems - such as the high tier 27% triangle and radial gems?  Thanks in advance for your input and your replies.   I hear ya.  I've completed the chalices on 3 or 4 characters (with one more, my BT toon, to go), and like I said, at first it was a pain in the ass, but then I started breezing through them, so it has become less of a pain.  But what I meant was, let's say you get summoned into the defiled to get the pthumerian ihyll chalice (the one with the queen), even then, you might have the chalice now, but then you'd still have to go back and farm for materials to create that one for yourself, no?  Not to mention, if you wanted to farm specific chalices for specific loot, you'd be unable to since you lacked the root chalices.   Did you have to go back and farm for chalice materials then to be able to even create the chalice, then?   I mean, as much as I was annoyed at having to run chalices on toons to run depth 5 and so forth, the fact that the SRRC is a total clunky piece of shit when it comes to connecting for multi-player has made the skip options seem dubious to me.  I'd rather just run the dungeons quickly and get them over with (it doesn't take that long once you know them) than sit for 15-20 minutes at a time at some off-hand chance to even be summoned into the correct dungeon.  How long did it take you to connect anyhow?  Thanks :D   I agree on some points, but to be less one-sided, if you play the chalices level appropriately, they aren't as boring, and if you thoroughly explore and loot all the mandatory story chalices in order, you won't have to farm any materials at all, as you will wind up with more than enough materials to create the story chalices.   Edit: worth noting, I do enjoy exploring and seeing what challenges and enemy varieties the depth five R/F/C dungeons throw at me :D   Seriously man.  Read what you wrote.  You sound like you are 16 years old. I was attempting to salvage the situation, but it seems you can't even face up to what I wrote, and you obviously can't have an adult conversation about it.    That being said, you are paranoid and delusional if you think I'd create multiple accounts to upvote myself.   Good point.    Holy shit!  Neil Young, the first hunter!   Hmm, maybe 125 is the sweet spot, but at that point, you'll be getting matched with 150's and higher anyhow, no?   Point taken, and yes it is easy to get the gems, but praisethesun is right when he points out that people keep treating this game's PvP like it's dark souls 3, when it is not. We've eliminated poise, buffs, medium armor, heavy armor, the weight system (and gear choices that it entails), and a few other odds and ends, yet what we have are weapons that do more damage than ever before, and for some reason, in a game with clunkier match making and long loading screens, it's no surprise that people are dissatisfied with the PvP experience where everyone kills each other in 2 to 3 hits.    Yep. My uncanny BB is siting at something like 650-700 AR with those gems (and those are the weaker gems, not the highest you can go) which still isn't as much as my uncanny LHB that is at 850 with plain old 26-27% gems in it, but I prefer BB for PvP anyhow, and it has and takes a lot more finesse :D   Edit - worth mentioning that you can get lots of blood chunks and the exact gems you need for the uncanny BB and regular BoM (killing 2 birds with one stone) by farming layer 1 chalice bosses. Just look up the appropriate glyphs.    Diversity?  We only have five builds in this game... but you do bring up some good points :)   I have yet to try the 150 pvp meta, but I love the idea of it, as there are only five builds in this game, and what the hell do our 'unique' (one of five) builds matter when anyone running the current standard meta can kill each other in two to three hits?  PraiseTheSun has a point - trying to keep a low level meta of mid-game level, yet wielding the very end of game 27% damage gems is pretty ridiculous.   I don't.  Get an uncanny burial blade and fit in three +8-9% physical damage with +60-70 flat arcane damage gems :D    Well, in DaS, there is the brilliant writing that was snuck in there from Oscar (who gives you the estus flask) in the beginning, right before he dies:  he says, 'perhaps you can continue my chosen undead quest to ring the bells, and *keep the torch lit so to speak.'*.  Big allusion to the whole kindling the flame thing, but even then, he is handing us his quest, and the answer is right there, hidden in plain sight.   We go to Yharnam, and we are faced with a similar mysterious dilemma, though we actually know our character was there to seek paleblood (as reiterated by the blood minister).  The difference is, if anything, our PC in BB has a motivation, even if we don't know anything about it, though in DaS, our toon was just rotting in a cell until Oscar came and freed him, and later gave us his quest.  The point is, they are equally mysterious, and equally vague, though I can see why you would think what you think.  With DaS, Oscar is someone else putting their quest on us, and in BB, we have a quest, we just don't seem to remember much (or know much about it) in the first place.  And just as well as DaS is written with that information in plain-sight, BB is written well too, as I think the blood minister gives us the biggest clue of all:  "Where's an outsider like you to begin?  With a bit of *Yharnam* blood of your own."  Dude is straight up injecting us with the dead queen's blood (the same blood that has corrupted all), and thus begins our mysterious adventure to keep the torch lit, I mean, seek the paleblood.   But I'd agree, but I don't think it is the story itself that it is lacking.  It is the...movement and timing maybe?  I don't know how to put it, but it does feel a bit jumpy or off at times, but to me, it also sort of suited the cosmic horror nature of the game.  Maybe it was the whole 'hi gothic horror adventure, holy shit SURPRISE MOTHERFUCKER SPACE SQUIDS!!1!' thing that threw you off?   Wow.  And you are a clear example of a presumptuous, jump down your dick internet asshole who decides to be hostile and ridiculously aggressive for no apparent reason, other than, fuck you, I guess?  As if I somehow had threatened the core of your existence?  Why are you so sensitive dude? (and I mean that seriously).     nbsp;  Did vaati kill your mother and copy your work too?  I mean, it's ok, we all have our own dispositions, and I'm sensitive too, but I try not to come out the gate foaming at the mouth, calling people douche bag for their opinion, making assumptions about what they believe, and in general acting like a total cunt.  Sure, in the post you responded to, I said 'I think OP is being hypocritical,' and he was being hypocritical.  He made the post (only to delete it later) to make a knee-jerk claim that his content was stolen before he even confronted the person in question about it, and then he tells other not to act so knee-jerkingly after he started the shit in the first place?  How is that not hypocritical?   nbsp;  And speaking of word usage, I find it pretty damn funny that you bring up how irrelevant word usage is, while the very root behind the subject at hand is the particulars of language that FROM uses in their games - and that language makes all the difference in these games, as well as in real life and art and language and poetry and everything else.  You discount the power of words, here of all places?  That's pretty goddamned ridiculous, so don't tell me that words and semantics don't matter, though I suppose you might be one of those people whose words don't mean shit to them, because they don't value their own word, honor, or integrity.  But I don't know.  So far you've yelled at me like an asshole, but I don't know where you stand with integrity and honor.   nbsp;  Lastly - I don't know about you, but I don't care for drama queens.  I'm too old for that shit, and too old for random internet asshole arguments too, but I'll entertian this all a bit more:  if your wife/GF/SO thought you were cheating on her (whether it was true or not) would you rather her,  A) confront you in private first, and discuss it there first before jumping to conclusions?  or  B)  Kick in the door to a family and community party or event, and have her accuse you in front of everyone?   nbsp;  Because OP did B.  He did option B with little no no proof.  To be fair, OP did credit a bunch of people in his essay (as one should, and no, I am not cool with plagiarism), from anonymous users who helped him come to his final conlusions, and people who helped him put it all together, so at least he has that going for him.  And to be thorough, I also threw out the names of other "original" content creators in other posts, so chill out with your assumptions.  You know it's not a bad thing that there are say, more than one band making original music, or one artist making one kind of art, or one director making movies, or one DeS/DaS fan making fan videos, right?  Sure, give credit where credit is due - to the originals and to the people who helped set the bar and garner interest in a field and who pioneered something, but it doesn't mean that it has to or should stop there....   Yep.  I never realized how much I'd miss boss-soul weapons, the clunky upgrade paths of DaS1 or even the simplified infusions of DaS2.  It was never as OP as say, damage +27% x 3, and at least you had different classes of armor (as well as buffS) that could counter those harder hitting weapons and spells anyhow.  (And few seem to take this into consideration compared to level metas in previous games:  that we used to have poise, armor that had weight vs. defences vs. elemental resists, rather than mostly fashion, etc)   I can sort of see from a design view, since there were so few weapons, they wanted to make them more customizable, but RNG gem farming (or any farming for that matter) isn't the best game design or use of a player's time imo.  Off hand though, I'm not sure how they could have achieved said customization, aside carrying over some form of infusions, or maybe just have less gem slots.  And then there is balancing for PvE and PvP as well, so I'm not sure how that would have looked with infusions either, but I digress.  I'll back up my save in the days to come and try out this 150 meta.   And here are a few last questions for you - what is your actual vitality at on your 150 toons?  And what does that total health pool look like?  Do you use it with or without health runes?     And have you tried any other PvP hot-spots with the level 150 meta?  If so, which one is the best with consistent and frequent match-making?  I don't want to feel like I am stuck in nightmare frontier for an eternity.  It'll be like the iron keep bridge all over again :D   Edit:  The more I think about this, the more it makes sense.  People keep clinging to the point of builds and the sacrafice we make for them (which has always been important in these games), which does have merit, but they totally fail in the lower meta argument in every other regard since they dismiss the fact that we no longer have poise, armor weights (and the sacrafices we made for gear choices), better armor and elemental resists, magical buffs, and instead of simple weapon upgrades and infusions, what we do have are gems that make us do ridiculous damage.     Besides, there are only four builds in this game (five if we include quality as a build in itself, which we can and should), but aside pure lower level builds, a lot of builds still dip into secondary stats anyhow (Ie, STR usually has some SKL, BT usually has some SKL for untransformed chikage, etc), so it's not like we are going overboard anyhow, or making our toons be masters at everything.  I think people really are comparing BB to the Souls games too much, and trying to treat it as more of the same is gimping the gameplay.   Yeah, but DaS and BB were both very specific with item placement, and there were usually specific reasons as to why items were where you find them, or why you receive items from specific enemies (not including RNG chalices).  And being that they specifically make Caryll out to be a mystical genius, it seems kinda odd that all of a sudden, any old asshole can now understand and create runes.  So far, I don't think it is due to randomized item drops, I just think it was oversight on their behalf in the item descriptions :D   Yep.  And a lot of us enjoy a good, challenging and more evenly matched fight.  If I was to say, co-op with a friend that I was much higher level than, I would either use a completely un-upgraded weapon, or fight with my bare hands to make it more on par, but I have yet to do that anyhow :D   Bingo.  He was constantly rooted in place due to the slow recover time, and I was constantly getting flinched by buckshot in my crotch.  Either way, was one hell of a party.  It was satisfying once I pinned him to a wall and shredded him with my saw spear.  From there, it took about 5 minutes of wandering to finally even find the host (as it was for a co-op round).  RIP Papa G   Ah, bloodborne huh?   You're only a week late, but to be thorough, I didn't say he IS a dick.  I said he is being a dick about this.  Apparently he agreed to to some degree, as he deleted his post.   In regards to the previous posts on this topic about level metas, I do think you're right about one thing - it is kind of oxymoronic that people want to cap their builds at 75-100, yet farm for the 27% gems.  Between the clunky multi-player and the loading screens, I don't understand why people enjoy this as much as they do.   At that point, if you're going to use the highest gems, why not bring up the meta to 125-150, that way people won't be dieing in 2-3 hits?  Or why not stay 100 but use no gems, or why not level to 150, and not use any gems there either, even though that winds up being more like a war of attrition...    Yeah, I whomped a dude last night who just kept spamming his blunderbuss.  I usually see pistols and evelyn's more than the shot-gun spread weapons, but those pellets are obnoxious when they make you stutter, and yet, brings no real advantage because not either him nor I him could do anything about it with a follow up attack...   The coolest thing is that you can make an awesome SKL build that still can rock LHB for 800+ AR, and still utilize the BB to max potential.    You don't need arcane to be more than 15 if you just want to use the tools, as the BoM and BB get squat for damage from arcane. You just have to gem them properly, which are the +physical damage/+flat arcane damage gems. Both weapons are monsters once you socket them correctly.   Edit: you just need 18 arcane for augur. And if you make the build right, you can sit at around level 100-110 and also rock LHB for shit tons of damage too, while still having 50 SKL for good visceral damage.    I think it is the Queen's blood, and with FROM's history of hiding answers in plain-sight, I think the blood-minister in the cutscene tells us exactly what we are taking:  "Where's an outsider like you to begin?  With a bit of *Yharnam* blood of your own."  After all, the city is named after her, and it sprung up around Laurence and the healing church he founded.     The rest of my theory is conjecture:  that the great one's blood is indeed pure, hence, there are some pthumerians who didn't go full beast, but once you start ingesting second-rate, second-generation blood, enter super PMS beast mode!   DaS2:  "*You will stand before the gates of the kindom, without even really knowing why."*  -The Firekeeper Narrator at the beginning of DaS2.     This is a fairly accurate description of pretty much every FROM game - we have vague ideas of what's going on, and we have to find our own purpose within the complex web of events that happened or are going to happen.  My PC was motivated in BB.  I wanted to know what the hell was going on, but the story is and was, I was being duped and puppeted by others, until I said fuck this and ate some aborted babies and then killed the moon prescence and transcended into a squid.  Take that bitch-ass MP!   Another thing I see tossed around loosely:  the original blood/medium used for ministration, and the time-line about the city of Yharnam itself.  Please correct me if I am wrong:   We know the story pretty much started with the discoveries at Byrgynwyrth, and the split came when Laurence left to pursue the power of blood (and founded the church), but the issue I have is that I see everyone talk about it as if Laurence set up a church in Yharnam, whereas, I'm pretty sure that several in-game item descriptions indicate that Yharnam pretty much sprang up around Laurence and the healing church.  Hell, it's even named after the Pthumerian Queen, which would be a hell of a coincidence if it was founded before Laurence got there to found the church.  The other thing I mentioned, is the medium itself.  I think the beast plague comes from second-rate blood.  Byrgynwyrth/Laurence didn't find unadulterated kin or great one blood imo, they found incestuous Queen Yharnam blood.  Given FROM's history of hiding things in plain-sight, the original doctor tells us exactly what he is giving us:  *"some Yharnam blood of our own."*  The transfusion we are given is the same corrupt blood of Queen Yharnam that everyone else has been using.   Again, just like the seeming continuity error I mentioned on my previous post on this topic, I see these details glossed over or mixed-up constantly, and I'd like to see it cemented in place if it is true, or thrown out (all if possible) if it isnt.   Your thoughts?     Someone once pointed out that Wilhem indeed wants you to kill Rom, hence he points at the lake - he wants Rom to no longer hide or block the ritual(s), the implication being that he wants you to see the madness for yourself to stop it, and this goes back around to the Bygynwerth/church split, as we know Wilhem wanted to stop experimenting with blood, hence he wants you to stop the church/choir/mensis.  All the notes about 'the spider hiding rituals' seem to coincide with this, as he is directly keeping the red moon at bay, and the summoning of the one reborn.  But if you interpret all that slightly differently, there is another possibility that the choir (that's why the hunter is there guarding wilhem) placed Rom where he is, so it could hide their dark rituals from the rest of the populace, and as you suggested, the events in Yahur Guhl could just coincide with time passing.  I believe the former, not the latter, but the latter would still make sense in certain context.   I always thought Rom looked more like a caterpillar than a spider.  Also, we get kin blood from him, not great one.  I was thinking that Rom is possibly kin, yet to evolve into an actual great one.  I was also thinking that the husk-like fossil thing in the choir church that Ebriatis is at, could possibly have been her husk, but that wouldn't make much sense, since she was already 'the great one who was left behind or abandoned,' so it wouldn't make sense if she metamorphisized later...   edit:  In answer to your other question, if wilhem did indeed create or summon or place Rom where he is to stop the mensis/choir/church rituals and practice, it wouldn't be inconsistent per se, as Rom is seemingly just a band-aid to the problem, a temporary fix, and not a final and actual solution, so Wilhem's desire is that you put a full stop to it, rather than rely on his temporrary solution.   Ahem, I think we only have more questions now...   But we don't know if she gave birth to a great one in the times of ancient Pthumeru, do we?  What we know is she is dead, and it seems the great ones descended in current times to impregnate her, because like the hunters and gherman and Mic Cage, she can retain consciousness by force of will.   One seeming continuity error that annoys me in game is the description that says *"master wilhem would have been proud of Caryll's runes,"* implying that Wilhem never got to see the fruit of Caryll's work, yet, Wilhem is in possession of the eye Rune.  Worse still, in all the biggest lore posts and videos, I've never seen that seeming error mentioned.  I've heard that same description of 'wilhem would be proud' quoted, and all manners of things related to them, but I have yet to see anyone say 'there is a discrepency here.'   Your thoughts?   Yeah.  I shouldn't have used duct tape :/   Is it a caccoon casing?  For all we know it is a husk of her caccoon, though I don't know why it has the name it has, or why it is where it is per se.  As OP said, it is very similar to Ron the Funky Caterpillar...   Yep, though the initial transform attack into the 2hand version is too slow    Heal Problems?  Learn to toss numbing mist vials to keep them from healing, toss poison daggers, or learn to shoot and interupt and/or parry+visceral the heals.  Learning to parry?  Time your reactions better.  Don't blindly shoot and cancel out your own parries, and don't be so jumpy that you dodge backwards or sideways every time you shoot, as you might have gotten a parry (lag) and need to dodge forward to follow it up with a visceral   Eburietasu-son say, *"SUDOKU!"*   If you've cleared the chalices (or are at least to the depth 4 story chalices), just put on a moon rune or three and use a hunter's mark to clear a room or two in some of the depth 4 to 5 dungeons, rinse, and repeat.  You can have millions of blood echoes in 15-30 minutes.   SHUT UP TOM GIT GUD SKRUB!   Just kidding.  Yeah, there are some great people here, and there are also plenty of unnecessarily hostile, jump-down-your-throat-for-no-reason type ding-bats here that will defend their angry, insecure dellusions to the death, so don't be too discouraged when you find the typical internet assholes crawling out the wood-work  :D  Good hunting to you o/   Don't give up skeleton!  I mean, pull the lever!  Wait, what's going on again?   Yep.  Very linear and short, though the awesome level design helped hide that in BB :|   The runes and rocks I have experienced, but I have never seen a blood chunk in a chalice dungeon, aside the recent post patch boss drops, and the one time a gargoyle happened to drop one :/   To be thorough though, bloodtinge builds are really fun to play imo, even outside PvP.  Besides.  We only have four or five builds at most in this game, so I can't really blame anyone for using one quarter of the options available to us...   I know journalism typically appeals to a four to eighth grade reading level, but aside being a general skrub, it's a sin to use the words *getting* and *like* in professional writing  :D   And BB doesn't?  All that cooperation with Sony and they couldn't set up a little something for FROM for BB?  That's a bummer, but even then, I don't see why they couldn't have just morphed the summon signs to messengers that sat there ringing the bells for you, that way you could still easily and classically find a summon bell messenger (red or white for pvp and pve), activate it, and expect and know that most of the times without fail, that person you just summoned will be coming into your world, rather than, *I'm wasting an insight to ring a bell, then hope and wait for someone to show up, and half of the time, it just fails out, and I have wasted 10-15 minutes of my play time, or even longer with less success when it comes to the SRRC*   Yeah.  I hate the way multi-player in general works in this game.  It worked so smoothly in DaS2, and even more smoothly in DaS by comparison, and I don't see how or why it was such a step backwards for BB :(   I had previously never seen a blood chunk come from a CD's treasure chests or tombs, and I still haven't, but I have received a lot of chunks from layer 1 and 2 bosses in depth 4-5 dungeons :D  edit: clarity   I could say no based on my experience, as one of my toons who had previously looted a blood rock from a chest in one of each dungeon type received a blood rock from a layer 3 boss in a depth 5 dungeon.    Edit: worth noting, I don't know how rare the blood rocks drop rate is, as I've cleared maybe 4 or 5 depth 5 dungeons between the toon I mentioned and another toon post patch, and I've only seen the one blood rock drop so far.    For sure.  I know if I was a new player to the souls/borne franchises, it'd be more akin to the wonder of our first trips through DeS and DaS, so the familiarty and suspicion made the game less intimidating, though I still found my first playthrough very engrossing, and the atmosphere is superb to be sure.   I agree with you about the armor thing being liberating, I really do, especially compared to how wonky and undependable poise wound up being in DaS2, but I still appreciated that being light weight meant you had to sacrafice stats and gear to move fast, and it wasn't a simple matter of aesthetics.  And while I appreciate the fashion options without having to upgrade all your armor to stay competitive, I actually think upgrading armor would be a good option to counter how ridiculously powerful the blood gems are in BB's PvP.   Armor choices aside, (besides pure fashion), and aside when plenty of us say fashion  stats,  armor wasn't just a matter of choosing stats carefully, it was (and still is, DaS2 pvp is pretty great) also choosing gear more carefully.  Sure, no weight in BB is cool, and being able to equip a weapon in 2 slots on each hand w/o weight is great, but even that is a step backwards from DaS2 where we could have three on each hand, though managing that could be clunky or weigh you down too much, but it was still an option that a lot of people used.     But all that being said, I think I might be using the wrong lens to appreciate BB (at least, the end game/pvp) for what it is.  Just like while DaS2 was not the best Souls game, it was and is the best RPG (and pvp) game in the series.  Instead of trying to look at BB like more of the same, I feel like I should look at it like others haev suggested - almost more like a fighting/arcade game.  While I don't agree with the 150 meta per se that these same people have mentioned, they do have a point that it intentionally plays very differently.  I welcome 'differently,' but it is hard to enjoy it when differently winds up being limited, and definitely more limited than the previous FROM game.   Biased how?  Like I said, I think BB is a master-piece of a game, and I guarantee nothing will come close to this game for the rest of 2015, at least as my personal favorite of the year, but that doesn't mean it doesn't have its faults.   The game itself is actually very linear.  There are only a handful of optional areas that people can miss, but that doesn't make it any less linear.  And while you can skip those along with a boss or two in the main game, it is all still very straight-forward, as you always start and end in the same place.  Again, the awesome level design hides this fact very well.  I know we could talk about the story chalices here, but again, those are very linear, and I don't think they are designed well enough to be able to talk about them as if they are some solid content, or at least, in the same category as the main game.   As for the armor, while most of it looks very cool, and it does have stats, most of it is comparable, besides a few odd instances where you might want frenzy resist or lightning resist.  As you know, the important difference is that past games had poise, and different classes of armor with weights that complimented different builds, and thus, on top of a lot of fun weapon options, you also had your fashion/armor options, which played very differently, from light and fast, to medium and versatile, to heavy and slow like a tank.   At first I thought it was cool that everyone in BB was a ninja fast hunter, but I didn't realize how much this lack of armor variety would truly kill the creativity, versatility, and build options.  Couple this with the fact that were are so few weapons (even if they are all pretty awesome), and the fact that we have four to five stat builds at most to use, and then you see how the game is super limited in variety, and the PvP plays very samey, even if you make one of each build (as I have).  Sure, there is a big differene between how BT plays vs arcane or quality, but still, even then, it can become fairly redundant.     As for myself, I never realized how much I'd miss boss weapons and excessive weapons (even if a lot were samey, a lot of them were still unique) until I was sated on Bloodborne :/   Yes - I've made several PvP characters as well, and to be able to complete the quests I want, get the items I want, and level what I want, it still only takes a few hours.  A little over two or three hours for the main game, and another two hours (probably a bit longer) for the chalices - which is really damn fast when you think about it, and it is super easy once you have the know-how, but that's the way it goes with all the souls games once you figure them out.  Of course, on my first play-through I took my time, and explored a lot and so forth, but even then, the game seemed surprisingly short, and being familiar with FROM's tropes and way of hiding things, BB just fealt supremely easier once I was accustomed to the mechanics.  It was even easier on subsequent playthroughs, and even the cursed mechanic isn't much of a bother anymore.  I'm sure a new player to FROM games would not agree though.   Of course, building new toons for PvP isn't as fast as a true speed-run, but it can still be done very fast, and depending on someone's play-time, it can be done in a few sessions, and even less if you don't bother to farm for the 27% and other top-tier gems, which aren't even necessary depending on the weapons you use, as you can still two to three shot a lot of people with the main game gems.   Here's hoping the DLC brings some much needed variety and multi-player options to the game :D   What bias?  I said this game is a master-piece, it's just severely limited in quite a few areas, especially one of the most important in any of FROM's game:  the multi-player.    As for the difficulty, I suppose you didn't see the 'relative to other Souls game part (especially for people who aren't new to the series),' but then again, that has been the point in all these games.  Sure, they can still deliver an ass-whooping, but once you learn them, they become significantly easier.  As for my critique of this great game, I was dissapointed at how short and linear BB is, though the awesome level design hid that fact well.  From there, the multi-player system is stupid and clunky, the SRRC is terrible, PvP invasions are extremely limited and the health penalties are asinine.  The covenants are also lame as fuck.  I could go on, but that is a good place to stop.  Still a great game, I just wish they had more time to make it even better.   FROM wankin off fkin casul scrubz ruin dis gam 4ever!!1!   I m fkin leet and u nead u all 2 kno thes.  How am I gank pVe skrubs nao tht evry1 is sumun lvl 200 friens?   Das not souls.  I kno souls.  Thas not souls.  NOT SOUL SNOT SOULS SNOUL S SNOT NOT SOULS!   But ast leest I cen sumun sum1 to beet teh clerik beest 4 me cuz he is sooper harrd on NG+   Fckin skrubs neeed 2 git gud!       Actually, compared to the other souls games, BB is pretty short and easy, and once you've run through it once, it is fairly easy to take a character through pretty much the entire game in an hour or two.  The chalices slow you down, but if you speed run those, you can still be done with them in short order.  A good defence of the changes FROM made to co-op, is simply to say, it's cool that they let friends and people have fun summoning each other, because I'd wager that just because someone can summon a high level into their game, a lot of new and low-level players won't be summoning high levels in to beat the cleric beast for them, simply because it takes premeditation, and not everyone plays these games in group or co-op at all.   Point is, this game is already easy and short and limited in every aspect that has made FROM games great: builds, variety, armor that is more than fashion, covenants, and a better multi-player experience for PvE and PvP.  It is a msterpiece to be sure, but fairly dissapointing in a lot of regards (not talking about the FROM hype either).  I am fine with them opening up the game a bit to let friends play with each other online easier.  Now, if they'd only fix a myriad of other fundamental problems with this game, like the SRRC, or covenants, or the stupid invasion system and its penalty...   I hate that stupid light on the controller.  It creates unnecessary glare, and it makes it harder to spook myself in the dark    Just did another 5 runs of pwmf22gu, and nothing more than 25% gems...  edit:  and a 6th one yielded a lvl19 27%.  Woohoo!   HookerFolio   Winnie like The Pooh?  Or whinny like a horse?  Or winning like Charlie Sheen?   Right, but even the higher % attack gems still give crap returns on the crap arcane stats on BB and BoM.  Those weapons are min-maxed with the +physical gem w/ flat arcane damage, and that is how you optimize those weapons' split damage.  What annoys me is it is still a lot more work to get usable gems for those weapons, than say, throwing in a few easy to aquire 20%+ physical gems in weapons like ludwig's or the chikage, and even worse is trying to get the best arcane gems :/   I can see the wonder of it all now:  the static bell maidens summon maidens that then summon more maidens that summon spiders. You spawn into a chalice dungeon, and wonder why the floor is red and sparky, only to realize that the floors and walls and all the enemies are now made out of red spiders. You go to flick the lamp to escape, but the lamp was really a summoned red spider all along. YOU DIED.    BoM and BB aren't meant to get their best damage and best AR's off the arcane stat, as it scales like shit, and is built by that design.  The damage is split with the weird scaling because you min/max those weapons with the +phys damage gems with the +flat arcane damage gems, and that is how you get 600 AR+ on BB and BoM's.   150 means we wil have two or three builds, instead of four or five.  This game is already severely lacking in options, variety, and creativity when it comes to PvP, and as stream-lined and as fun as it could be, I think it is unnecessary.   Edit:  worth noting on the BoM discussion.  The BB and BoM weapons aren't meant to get their damage from Arcane stat scaling - they get their best damage off the +phys % with +flat arcane damage gems, as they both attack fast and can really dish out the numbers when gemed appropriately...   As others have said, Ludwig's Holy blade is sort of seen as the go-to newb weapon, as you can find it early in game, and it is easy to pump up the damage on it relatively quikcly.  I never even picked it up until my third or fourth character in, and I gotta admit, I see why it is the go-to weapon - it is extremly powerful, you can pick it up fairly early, it scales well with both STR and SKL for either type of build (or a more balanced quality build at like 35/35, but I prefer to specialize and pump at least one to 50), you can enchant it with papers, and it is easy to get that thing to 600+ AR, whereas other weapons involve a whole lot more gem farming (specially arcane, or the other SKL weapons with optimal gems) to really max out the potential AR.    That being said, Ludwig's will be your go to when you really are having trouble with a boss, or want to sort of smash your way through everything.  For a bit more finesse, and to vary up your play-style to keep things interesting, if you do go for a SKL build, then you'd want blades of mercy, and my favorite, the burial blade.  There is also the cane, but I can't stand the weapon's AR, moveset, or anything about it (just my opinion though).  Again, Ludwig's is easy to fall back on, because to get the best AR and gems on the BoM and BB, you need an uncanny burial blade (triangle slot instead of waning), and you need to farm gems with %physical damage plus flat arcane damage (ie, +9% physical damage, +65 flat arcane damage).  These weapons have lower base AR's, but a little innate arcane damage, but they hit quick, so between the physical and the arcane, if you gem them right, you can easily have 300+ physical damage and 300+ arcane damage per hit.  That is a lot on the burial blade, and especially the blades of Mercy since they hit super quick :D   If you went STR, you are dealing with slower weapons (though even the slow weapons in this game are fairly fast).  You have the axe with decent AR, but it is the awesome, versatile, crowd-mangling 2hand moveset that really makes it shine.  There is the wheel, which is very... different, but I couldn't get into, no matter how hard I tried (worth checking out though).  The stakedriver is fun, and it definitely takes more finesse and timing than a lot of other weapons, and lacks reach, and finally, there is the hammer, which I wanted to like, but honestly, between a lot of the terrible camera angles, I often found my entire character, the enemies, and half the screen being blocked by the giagantic hammer that was slung over my shoulder, and I just couldn't play the game like that.  But with all that being said, it is definitely worth trying them out to see which ones you like best, and from there, you could try to see where you'd like to take your build.  There are a few other weapons I didn't mention, but the ones I mentioned are the most popular and versatile ones.   Worth noting, for a standard level 100-120 build for Co-Op and/or PvP, you want at least 40 vitality for health (especially due to co-op/invader -30% health handicap), 20 endurance (though I prefer 25, as 20 won't even give you every weapon's full 3 to 4 hit combo), and a primary damage stat at around 50.  Blood tinge should be ignored unless you are making a blood tinge build, and arcane should be at 15 if you want to use the hunter's tools, but no higher unless you are making a full arcane build.  Hope this helps.  Edit:  typos/clarity  Edit 2:  To be clear, I'm pretty sure you're right about LHB being top dog for damage.  Other weapons might have more versatile move-sets, be quicker, or be more engaging or challenging to use, but in terms of raw damage especially with being able to be enchanted, I'm pretty sure Ludwig's is the highest damage weapon in game.   Oh yes!  This one too!   Even with a B/B scaling in STR and SKL, supposedly Ludwig's Holy Blade gets slightly more AR out of STR than skill, so for a quality type build (which you already have), I'd leave either STR where it is, or SKL where it is, and max one of them up to 50 for your primary damage stat.  Personally, I prefer SKL weapons in this game (namely for a particular end of the game weapon), and SKL also increases the damage of your visceral attacks, so in general, I feel like SKL  STR in terms of general usefulness in BB, never mind the slightly slower attack speeds of a lot of STR weapons (though they still wreck).   That being said, my original toon was a STR build, and I had a lot of fun with it and really loved the hunter's axe, but my main toon for PvE/PvP is a 25 STR / 50 SKL /15 Arcane (for tools) SKL type quality build that is capped at level 110.   Cool.  So there is hope, huh?  I was mainly wondering if I was wasting time still looking to get lv 19 gems from said bosses, since I oddly didn't see one drop after an hour+ of farming last night, whereas, the night before I received several in quick succession.  Thanks for your input, and damn you RNJesus!   It's the ghost of Gwynn!   Yes yes yes.  And worthwhile PvP covenants, and an arena, and better conenctivity, and better summong/invading options period.   I know a lot of people tested this, but part of me thinks it was all in people's heads all along :P   As I said in an above reply, I don't have a large enough pool of accurate data, and RNG is stupid like this, but I found it odd that I received several 18 (or is it 19?) gems in a short time pre-patch, and post patch I didn't pick up a single 18 or 19 gems in a similar amount of boss kills.  Could have just been opposite RNG day.  Will try some more tonight.  Thanks for your input.   Yep...  wish they could have come up with better or different rewards for the chalices, and different ways of upgrading your weapon aside gems...  Also, I hate the sloppy way they are organized in my inventory, and I hate searching through a massive pool of gems :D   Yes.  Yes I did.  Editing it now.  Thank you :)   Yeah.  I just found it odd that after at least getting a few 27% gems fairly quickly pre-patch, I didn't even get one within a similar amount of time of farming post patch.   Yes!  After being sated with BB in such a short time, SOFS totally engaged and engrossed me, which I didn't expect it too, at least for PvE, but it did, and I had already played DaS2 vanilla/DLC to death in both PvE and PvP from last year.    You'll notice a lot of different mechanics at play, more character stats and abilities to figure out, but the best thing is that the multiplayer is infinitely better than how slow and clunky the multiplayer in BB is, for both PvE and PvP :D   Edit:  As others have said, it is worth playing DaS as well, and DeS if you have a PS3.    Edit (added more): Out of DaS1/2, DaS is the better souls game, but take the whole *DaS2 is the worst* opinion with a grain of salt, because it is still a great game and people love hyperbole.  In fact, DaS2 it is the best RPG with the best PvP in the series, it just isn't the best SOULS game in the series :)   So, the day before the patch I had farmed up quite a few 27% physical damage triangle and radial gems quick and easy from the popular chalice glyphs many people use (5pwujscd for triangle and pwmf22gu for radials), and I was pretty much swimming in 27% damage gems.  In fact, I don't think anything less than 27% even dropped.   Last night I ran quite a few boss kills on both those glyphs (mostly pwmf22gu though) for 27% gems one of my lower level PvP toons, and I didn't see a single 27% gem drop.  At most, I received a few 25% gems.  Now, I didn't go about it in the most scientific manner or track the drops well or anything, but has anyone else who keeps better tabs on these things noticed a change in the drop rates of blood gems?  Did they make the 27% gems more rare?  I plan on running some more tonight, but until then, has anyone had similar experiences?  Can anyone confirm or deny?  Is it just RNJesus magic?  Thanks in advance for your replies. :)  Edit:  had wrong triangle glyph listed.   Yes.  Yes I did.  Anyway.  Drop me a line sometime.  We should totally play some bloodborne.   Uhhh, did you miss the joke? I was saying you didn't belong here because you weren't acting like a bitchy, over-reactive, self-righteous, self-important, cynical and life-hating, reddit dick-head...  	105
 ROBOT CHICKEN      Thank you very much!   Whoa, nice set ups. That switch-Axe Kick was sick. Nice Find! Thank you.   If glutes and hamstrings are the primary muscles used in the Axe-Kick, wouldn't focusing on Squats directly increase the power of an Axe Kick?   Deadlift primarily works on lower back muscles, right?   How does that translate into power for the Axe Kick?   Enough money will corrupt you eventually.   It was a counter-punch. He blocked his opponent's roundhouse kick and used a reverse punch at the same time.   I agree! Btw, If I may ask, what is exactly is "ITF-ish"?   Oh my gosh, thank you so much for your detailed advice! I will definitely practice these tips on my BoB tomorrow. For the reference - I do WTF-Style Taekwondo which, as you know, does not allow head punches so I will have to try feinting in. Any types of feints you would recommend? I really want to practice Hug's Spin Kick Feint to Axe Kick combo.  Once again, thank you very much!   I consider myself a martial artist, but I don't consider myself a "spiritualist" nor am I "spiritual" at all. Those two terms are not and should not be assumed to be associated with each other.    Great article by the way! Thanks for sharing.   Can it be attributed due to innovations of technology that allow us to accurately diagnosis cases, in which may not have been diagnosed in the past due to limitations on technology or just plain out factors that we still have yet to fully grasp - environmental, genetic defects, etc. ?   What I usually do is throw a couple of Roundhouse Kicks to the body have them thinking about that motion. Then, I'd do an Out-To-In Axe Kick which initially follows the same motion as the back leg Roundhouse Kick and then dropping it over my opponent. If it misses the head, it will hit the body. The Axe Kick, in my opinion, is a kick that covers one of the greatest amounts of range amongst all kicks.  I can't tell if Hug is hitting with heel or the ball of the foot, either or - the most important thing, it seems, is after getting the technique down - the timing.  I'm going to be honest and say I spam a lot of Axe Kicks. I'm going to stop using them so excessively in order to heighten my chances of nailing a really good one and dropping my opponent.   Just throwing an axe kick without any strategy isn't going to end well.  Right on. It seems to work well as a jam/cancel/trap attack so I'll try working my Axe Kicks on the motion.   DAN DAN KOKOROHIKARETEKU   Wow good eye spotting that Hug utilized the Axe Kick to cancel his opponent mid-attack. Do you ever utilize the Axe Kick in sparring, personally?            NAPPA DIDN'T SAY OVER 9000 YOU FUCKER   What the fuck.   /s.   That would be breaking the fourth wall, dude.   Oh I didn't know you could watch it live! Yes! Now I can support my dojang from the comfort of my own room.   Forgive me if this is not the proper subreddit for it, but I figured with all the active users - one can enlighten me on whether or not the fighters were at the same weight or if they met catchweight or if there were no weight classes at all in this fight.   Never would've thought there are Redditors that rival the perverts on 4Chan.   A lot of people, including the coaches at my own dojang, will religiously remind their students to keep their guard/hands up. However, if the top-level guys are having their guard down - is this the most efficient way to spar? Arms hanging at the sides to intercept fast roundhouse kicks from touching the Hogu?   Even in the Flyweight division, the shortest Olympic athlete that placed in London 2012 was 5'10'' which is quite tall compared to my size, 5'7''.  Of course, *anything* is be possible - but regarding EBP, E-Hogus, or Daedo -  scoring tends to favor the fighter with the longer reach.  Especially in a fast-paced game that now favors the lead leg cut kick to keep your opponent at bay and to cancel their kick, which works especially well for taller guys.  I do fine against taller opponents via regular chest guard but against taller guys with the E-Hogu - it's very difficult and I'd imagine, at the Olympic level, seemingly impossible.  The same strategy applies for taller, faster fighters I'd imagine - stay outside their kicking range and don't linger on the inside for too long. Angles and feints. Of course, that's easier said than done - especially if the lengthier fighter has a very good guard.  In fact, a strategy that my coach developed against tall fighters with strong guards that involves making them go negative via penalty points in order to win if traditional scoring just is not working at all. (Focusing on knocking them down/off-balance to make them fall while avoiding losing any points, getting them to step out of the ring, etc.)  Basically, it's a definitely harder to go up against a taller opponent, no question about it. But regarding getting into the Olympic-level in a game that favors height and speed, is that even possible?  Sorry if my grammar doesn't make sense, it's late at night and this is something that's been on my mind lately.   Yes.   If I had a nickel for every time this was reposted on this sub.

Were MULTIPLE SHOTS really necessary?   oh ok ty. i thought it meant south side for a bit. like the gang   Thank you for the information.   What you learn in Combatives is for an untrained opponent, so live sparring against a jiu-jitsu grappler doesn't really factor into the curriculum.  Well, it would make more sense to do that for self-defense than to prepare yourself against 1/10th of the population that actually knows jiu-jitsu. Most of the time it's someone untrained that's trying to punch your face in.   Yeah I just watched this video recently. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sgb1Attfm-0  It explains that they hold off on sparring until Blue Belt because it provides a good base for students to spar with when they finally do it. Sparring can be scary and as a white belt you usually end up getting murdered a lot - that can be discouraging and lead to many people giving up and quitting. Holding off on sparring gives them more confidence which leads to more people sticking with GJJ - according to the video. The video also lists their stats on how many people have joined and stayed since they incorporated this new system of instruction regarding the sparring in contrast to how many people have joined and left before the new system.   Very good point   Can you recommend me a bi/tri program?   Started training in Judo recently at my Taekwondo Dojang and the partner I usually pair up with is always falling before I even fully set-up or execute the technique. It makes me question whether what I'm doing is valid or if he's just being too submissive. I'd barely get my hook in on his leg without adding any force for a sweep yet and - there you go, he falls.  I feel like I'm not learning. Also, I should probably point out that my TKD instructor is also a Black Belt in Judo.   But that just goes back to the difference in systems right? Gracie Academy is focused on self-defense rather than rolling/free sparring for points.   Do the branches created through isolation translate into the trunk? AKA does doing isolation make your compound stronger?   What is a good routine/exercises I should follow to build my arms through these "branches"?    Do BJJ schools, on average, outside the Gracie Academy focus on what to do in those scenarios? Against an armed assailant, etc. or are they purely focused on what is legal in Sport Jiu-Jitsu?   Thank you for your very thorough and informative response. :)  On average, do BJJ schools ever touch-up on the topic of Self-Defense? EX: Neutralizing punches from the guard, escape getting body slammed from an armbar/triangle.  Or do they purely focus on what is legal in Sport BJJ?   How can you learn without live sparring? I don't think that's an accurate claim. They likely do have live sparring to prepare for spontaneous self-defense scenarios.   You do realize though that students of the Online Academy must be tested in person to earn their Gracie JJ Blue Belt, right? Simply being able to demonstrate the techniques via video may earn you a "Technical" Blue Belt, but an actual Blue Belt must be earned through rolling in the Gracie Academy.    I was referring to how people don't like that Gracie JJ teaches "self-defense" jiu-jitsu rather than "sport" jiu-jitsu. And is there an actual difference between "self-defense" and "sport" jiu-jitsu?   Oh, I was referring to the actual instruction at the Gracie Academy. But I understand the frustration about the online Gracie University tuition.   I'm gonna play the skeptic for fun.

WHEN NARUTO USES THEM AS A LADDER TO SLAM AT THE OPPONENT IN NINJA STORM. That shit was fucking bad.   Too bad it isn't real.   Can someone explain the significance of the title?   yes   He also drew Sasuke and Naruto kissing.   Face looks too chubby      He does indeed mention "Bunshin," however he STILL makes the damned mistake of pointing it out as a **Ninjutsu**. The Ninjutsu variant of the clone jutsu is the Kage Bunshin or Shadow Clone. Bunshin, regular clone technique, is a **Genjutsu**.  EDIT: Am I really being fucking downvoted for pointing out facts?   DUDE, THAT'S EXACTLY THE SCENE I WAS REFERRING TO.   Can you try to explain it to me?   After Naruto knocked down Neji, he proclaimed that he failed the graduation exam three times because of one jutsu that was always on the exam. His clones were pathetic, he said. He failed the **Shadow** Clone Jutsu/**Kage** Bunshin no Jutsu every time.  Interesting, except solid Shadow Clones/Kage Bunshins are not expected of Academy Students to create in order to promote to Genin.  He learned that technique from a Forbidden Scroll that contained the 2nd's Jutsus along with it's more advanced, forbidden version - the Multi Shadow Clone Jutsu/Tajuu Kage Bunshin no Jutsu.  Even Kakashi was surprised to witness that Naruto could truly use Shadow Clones in their first bell test.  I checked both versions, the Dub and the Sub for consistency and both versions mention that the Kage Bunshin no Jutsu was on the Academy Promotion Exam.  Even when we see Naruto test for his exam in the very first chapter/episode, he was asked to perform the Genjutsu-Variant, Clone Jutsu/Bunshin no Jutsu.  So what gives? This has always irked me since I first saw the episode.    *grabs your penis*    Not speaking from experience, but for martial arts wouldn't you want to focus on speed and power, not size and strength.   Definitely. But, I'm on "off-season" for competition and this is my first year going up in the Senior Division (18+). A lot of guys cut down to my weight class at 135 or 128 from two, maybe even higher weight classes so they have a sizable strength advantage over me.  I've always been a relatively small guy so I wanted to use this time to focus on building strength and mass and then cutting later once I get to competing again.  Are 5 day splits generally used for building muscle?     Three months. I kind of want to switch to doing a designated muscle group per day and only squatting once a week per leg day.   Do you think I should just stick to 5x5 for strength/mass training and deal with the soreness?  EDIT: I just want to do legs once per week.  	132
 No love for Terence Crawford here? The dude's unreal.   I'll also throw in Golovkin and Kovalev.  I feel like I should also say Canelo, but I don't know where I stand on that right now.    Ali is quickly becoming one of my favorite fighters. His fight against Abregu showed his power, and his last fight against Santana showed his durability. His face looked like he was hit with a few hammers over the course of the night after that one.   Bradley is elite, as many of you have mentioned, but I really think we'll one day look back and talk about how he just wasn't the same fighter after Provodnikov. Sure, he got his win over Marquez after that, but that BS draw against Chaves started to really show that scar tissue building up on his face. We saw it again just recently in his fight against Vargas. Combine that with the series of concussions he's accrued (I think he closed out the fight against Vargas with one), and you have to wonder how much more his body can take.   I've heard him speak a few times about it, but that Provodnikov fight had him talking with a slur for nearly SIX MONTHS after it was over. No doubt he gained the appreciation of fans and showed he can bang, but definitely a cause for concern.  I like Tim, but if Ali gets the edge in this one then Bradley should really start to weigh his options.    I actually had a similar convo with a buddy of mine after the Matthysse fight. He's going to be the network journeyman after all is said and done if he doesn't start getting a little more selective with his fights. I mean, I don't want to see him taking on tune up after tune up, but maybe two tune ups, then Matthysse. A tune up and then Rios. His tank-like style doesn't contribute much to longevity. As time goes on there will be less and less on his punches. And then what?   Absolute blood bath. Each guy would take years off his career.   Damn. Next time wait for him to get a hooker and time the shot for juuuuust the right moment.    What? When did I even ask a question?   Salido aside, Lomachenko needs a real fight where he is tested. And even that was a test of how many hits to the nuts he can take and still maintain his masculinity.  Rigondeaux cancels guys out, so it will be interesting to see what he does against an accurate volume guy like Lomachenko.   Great opportunity for each guy to showcase their talents and make some new fans. Hopefully it's as good in the ring as it looks on paper.    I stuck it out. Wasn't easy at all. If anything I think it made me want to finish it even sooner. Just to be done with it.   Yeeeeeah that was heavy. I had no idea how it would differ from the movie. So imagine my reaction when I came across that scene. haha   Haven't read The Road yet, but I think Catcher in the Rye should be read twice in life - once during those teenage angst years, and again in your 30s or 40s.    Ditto. I found myself glazing over that one. But I also found it to be artistry in a way whenever Bret Easton Ellis would do it. He knows people don't care about that kind of stuff, and if you actually do maybe you're not much different than the narrator.   Ending aside, I think the most memorable part of the book for me was touched on in some of the aforementioned comments regarding his attention to detail. The level of awareness only helps reaffirm the fact that the protagonist is absolutely insane. He's also working in an industry that employs vapid personalities focused only on the aesthetic side of it. Sometimes it's not even a personal aesthetic but it comes down to the restaurant they choose, the car they drive, the suit they wear. He turned all of that nonsensical stuff that the average person not working on Wall Street couldn't relate to into a game of constant judgment that practically anyone at any point in their life CAN relate to.  That said, some of his deaths in the book were even more over the top than the movie. I'm not a prude by any means, but that one murder with the rat gave me fits for days after reading the book. Even now as I think about it I remember the sweats I got as I feverishly turned the pages on that one.    This is pretty much one of my biggest fears ever. Hope you're OK.    Bought this as two separate volumes at a library sale two weeks ago (the super small print in the paperback version gives me a major headache). Can't wait to start it.    Is Bookbub the site that was first to get the Harry Potter series, or am I thinking of something else?   I purchased a Kindle 3 in 2010, and then followed up with a Kindle Fire HD tab in 2013.   The Kindle 3 is your basic e-reader, complete with the page-flip tabs on both the left and right of the frame. Honestly, I love this thing. Even if I read consistently for, say, one hour a day, a single charge can carry it for about three or four weeks so long as you keep wi-fi turned off (outside of buying books, you really don't need it on).  I noticed the complete opposite when I purchased the Fire. Although the color is great and the quality is incredible, I read books to get away from computers and a backlight. Although you can disable the latter, it's heavier than the Kindle 3, flips pages via a swipe motion, and doesn't last nearly as long on one charge as the 3 does. I took this with me on a five-hour flight one time, fully charged with Wi-Fi disabled, and it died before I landed. Side note: If you really like comics or graphic novels, this is an incredible way to read them in the digital world.   All in all, it comes down to preference. Do you want a tablet or an e-reader? The Fire is more of a tablet in my opinion, while the 3 and paper white versions are meant strictly for the hardcore readers.  As far as my relationship with it goes, I tend to go through fits of interest and disinterest with the tablet. In my mind, nothing beats a good library sale, as indicated by the stacks on stacks of books I have piled up in my room. But sometimes when I travel for business or I want to maybe read a few books at a time, I'll take the Kindle 3 along for the ride.    What about in those instances where a plot is hard to follow or just a series of broken storylines? Do you find yourself still going for it out of interest in how it all ends regardless?  If I don't find myself thinking about the book during lulls in my day, odds are I'm not too wrapped up in it. One of the more recent books I picked up and put down shortly after is the first Game of Thrones book. Too many characters and too disjointed for my tastes. I know it has a huge fan following, but it's just not for me.    I read the first Hunger Games book and pretty much concluded that it was good enough as a standalone and opted to not continue the series. I know it's a huge hit and all, but there was zero motivation on my part to pursue it as a series.    This may seem a little crazy but as a big-time sneaker connoisseur I often times use my girlfriend's nail polish remover to get rid of scuff marks. Of course, a shoe is a little more forgiving than a book, so I would make sure that if you do try this that you use a cotton ball, only a LITTLE BIT of nail polish remover and then give it a go.   You can also use a rubber eraser if you'd prefer to try that method first. Windex can get the job done too but, again, I'd recommend very little.   And please, if you do try, let me know if it worked :-)    Exactly. How do you not hear the chair roll away?   I try so so hard to avoid putting a book down for good. But what once started as a challenge to finish something (no matter how bad) eventually mutated into the understanding that laboring through a bad book was cutting into the time in which I could be reading a good one. So yeah, I've since put down a few books but I've always made sure the next one was very high on my to-read list.    You have a good friend.    Re-read it for a third time this year. Hits me differently every read.  Also my first Vonnegut book.    Waiter Rant is amusing, especially if you've ever served at any point in your life.

 I stopped playing the game recently (will come back to it, just into other games now) and I'm seeing a lot of posts about a bad update. What was so bad about it?   *Squirming intensifies*      Here's my resume!  * memes  * memes  * memes  * memes  * memes  * memes  * memes  * memes  * memes  * memes  * memes  * memes  * memes   No don't get me wrong he is absolutely my favorite YouTuber (well just the grump family in general) but he plays to the person of "total and utter hilarious d-bag"   Yeah but you're almost supposed to kinda hate Arin    I personally enjoyed it! I think it's definitely worth 8 bucks if you're into stealth.   I can say they thats not use for skateboarding in normal cases   So I guess skaters can't trip....   I added the language as an edit (vb)   I am putting the output into a label, it's just giving me the data like how I stated in the post   Added as an edit   So I have a random number generator and the code is like this      lbl1.Caption = Int(1 + Rnd * 10)     lbl2.Caption = Int(1 + Rnd * 10)     lbl3.Caption = Int(1 + Rnd * 10)       int1 = lbl1.Caption     int2 = lbl2.Caption     int3 = lbl3.Caption           intTotal = int1 + int2 + int3     and say the numbers were 4, 5, 9. I get 459 not 18. What am I doing wrong?  Edit: sorry Visual Basic   Disproving evolution with the "some are still the same today is like" statement is like saying if a slice of meat is on a sandwich then slices of meat can't be off a sandwich by themselves therefore sandwiches aren't real.

Oh okay thank you!   My directions:  Write a program that asks the user to input:   A sentence   A word found in the sentence    Another word to replace the first word that was selected  When the New Message button is clicked, the original sentence will be displayed with the users first word replaced by the second word.  For example, if the user types Learning to write computer programs is easy. into the first textbox, then easy and challenging into the second and third textboxes, the following message will be displayed, as shown in the interface below  http://imgur.com/IBmgqIc    I'm really struggling with this one and I am constantly having errors.

 Pulp Fiction.   American History X   Pulp Fiction: "Bring out the gimp"   Additional question: Have any of you seen "The Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea"? If so, is that worth a watch?   Thanks! Never considered The Abyss, love James Cameron though. Will definitely add to the list!   Excluding Jaws, I have not seen or heard of any good underwater thrillers. Do you guys know of any? (Documentaries about the ocean are welcome).   I love him in Horrible Bosses, along with the rest of the trio. He is a very loveable guy and can't imagine hating him in any role.   "If this doesn't work out for you, you fuck off back to your studio palace and dive back into that cultural genocide you guys are perpetrating. You know, a douche bag is born every minute, that was P.T. Barnum's premise when he invented the circus, and nothing much has changed, and you guys know that if you crank out any toxic piece of crap, people will line up and pay to see it, but long after your gone, I'm gonna be on that stage, earning my living, bearing my soul, wrestling with real complex human emotions!" -Mike Shiner(Edward Norton), Birdman (or the unexpected virtue of ignorance)   Don't believe I could conjure up a top 10, but my top 5 would be:  1. Guardians of the Galaxy 2. The Dark Knight  3. Iron Man 4. The Avengers  5. Captain America: The Winter Soldier   Forrest Gump, no doubt. He is one of my favorite movie characters of all time and seems like the guy who'd be with you through thick and thin.    I agree, Rogen has sort of cornered himself in comedy. I would love to see him become like Jonah Hill and show off some dramatic acting chops. Obviously they saw something to cast him in the movie, I have great faith. My guess he will be much better than Gad, but I'm pretty sure they were just shooting for look-alikes.   Landed on Gangs,and I am very much a movie enthusiast. I absolutely adore and appreciate great acting and creative direction, loved Gangs.   Oh don't worry I watched the first five minutes with my great aunt Dot. Had to turn it off immediately and was not really feeling it, landed on Gangs. Absolutely loved it.   Thank you, I was strongly considering Clockwork. I appreciate the input.   I have not.  	15

    I am a peggle addict but they don't make it for Android. Is there a decent Peggle like game for Android?   It depends on your mood. I saw Fury  last night and it was epic. The action scenes in it are unreal. It's a good emotional movie that make you feel for the main characters.   However if you want to laugh then 22 is a pretty funny movie that I reckon is up there with the first one.    Hey thanks heaps for all the advice.

 I'm not sure, But I believe there are some cases I've heard about where they just pick someone, usually someone they see as a threat in some way or even someone they just don't like and terrorize them, kinda like a school bully o-o.    I'm not well versed in Navajo Culture or such and I havent spoken to my grandma in many years. I'd love to get in touch with her again and I may just try and do that this weekend, but I'm not sure how stable her mentality is these days (like I said, she's in her 90's)   I firmly believe that at one point, I was a cat. Which is why I think I have such a connection with cats now. I have *always* loved cats, ever since I was little.   I don't remember this, but my mom said that when I was little, about 5 or 6, we were going to visit some friends of my parents way out in the country, I was looking out the window and as we passed a big, read barn, I go "hey! I was born there!" pointing at the barn.   My mom goes "no, you were born in the hospital silly"  and I go "oh, I know now, but before, I was born there, in the hay, with my brothers and sister, we liked to play a lot and my mom always brought us mice to play with".  She even said how I insisted I'd been born in that barn, even went into detail about what my "mother" and "brothers and sister" looked like.   My parents knew the people who lived in the property with the barn and they did have a lot of cats.   Every once in a while, growing up, I'd have dreams where I was wondering through the woods and I'd wake up the next morning bone tired.   I don't dream like that so much anymore.   May have just been my imagination though, while I do believe in reincarnation, I don't necessarily believe that we are meant to remember past lives.     Never seen anything, but I've heard of them.   Jumpers, my grandmother called them.   Beings from other times or dimensions, not aliens, but not something belonging to our world but that exist along side us. We usually cannot see them, but they are aware of us and so go out of their way to stay hidden.   Most of them are harmless and are usually more scared of you than you are of them. But some can be Maleficent.   My grandma on my moms side(she's 1/2 Navajo and 1/2 Irish) once told us a story of how, when she was a kid, she followed what she thought was a shadow cat, about 4 feet tall into the woods, she followed it until it disappeared into a rock only to find that she had ended up over 4 miles from her house.   	3

Putting it on straight wasn't easy, but I did the best I could.  *F - R - I - G - E*  *Clunk.*  Maybe all the words weren't spelled exactly right, but I knew what everything was. It made me happy to see them wearing their name tags. Things called just what they were.  I went down the hall to my parents' door.  *M - E - A - N - I - E - S*  *Clunk.*  I'd probably get in trouble for that later. I hurried down the hall to my room and locked the door. I labeled a few toys. My Etch-A-Sketch already had its name written on it, so I skipped that one.  I took out Daddy's toy from where I'd hidden it at the bottom of the toy box.  *G - U - N*  *Clunk.*  Then I pulled the trigger.

Not a mod, but you asked this almost 24 hours ago...  Without seeing it, it's just kind of hard to answer. /r/shortscarystories is for original works. They have rules against series/multiple parts and links to outside sources (specifically for self-promotion). My interpretation of it is that the *intent* of those rules should discourage you from posting it here.  A good rule of thumb is "What if everyone started doing this?" and I think that in this case it would be a negative thing. Be inspired by what you read, write whatever you want, but this probably isn't the proper outlet for it.  My personal opinion is that /r/DarkTales should be more popular than it is. /r/LibraryofShadows is another one, though the CSS there makes my eyes bleed. There used to be /r/AlmanacofHorrors (RIP) where I'd post things that just didn't fit anywhere else.  There probably are other poetry subs that would enjoy it.

"Brain is lighting up like a christmas tree."  "He's moving."  "Doctor, you're killing him!"  "Heart rate is stabilizing."  "What the fuck is this? Did you kink the tube or something?"

I go to therapy. At one point in time it was mandated, and I just kept going for the entertainment value. The drama. Some people have celebrity gossip, and I go listen to people talk about their problems. Is it so different?  Some of the most juicy group sessions are for military vets, police officers and security guards.   "I let him go with a warning and he killed his wife that night."  "My partner is gone and I don't deserve to be here."  "I shot a kid."  It's the stuff you might not believe if you didn't hear the eyewitness saying it.  There was a newcomer at our session. Fresh from Mule Creek where they send law enforcement to keep them insulated and safe. Prison's still prison though, and the older man looked like he'd been in long enough to pick up some habits. He was nervous, glancing over his shoulder, trying to keep an eye on everyone at once but not meeting their eyes. I'd been watching him since he walked in. It's a game I play: I try to guess what kind of incident brought them to this path in life.  I had him pegged as someone who went too far, got carried away and killed someone. He seemed a little unhinged.  After introductions and with a little encouragement from the facilitator, he opens up and drops a fucking bombshell.  I know him. From the train.  I saw the bite, I saw everything. I still have the scar.  I also saw him shoot the wrong man while they shuffled out the door.    I'll just pretend you were talking about me.   If you haven't torn the closet completely apart yet, get on it. There's something in there and ghosts don't use cars.   Sure, they'll ask that until they find the camera inside.

Mostly because of your username :P  Did you know about his page: http://theitchwrites.com/ ?   This is really unsettling for some reason. It's like her brain's skipping a cog or something.   Are you... *stalking* the_itch?   Nice! Thanks for the help.   I know exactly how I caught it. They say it spreads through blood and saliva, and I know exactly the moment when it entered my body.  "That's expensive wine, you know" I said to my wife. It was our thirteenth anniversary and I'd taken her out to dinner at our favorite place we couldn't afford. She'd been just comatose all night. I'd bought the whole bottle, but she had only taken one sip from her glass. "If you don't drink it, I'm pouring it back into the bottle."  "Why don't you... just... drink it yourself?" she asked. Her eyes settled on me, unfocused, staring off into the distance.  "Are you okay?"  "Oh yeah. I feel... *greeeat*."  "Marie. Are you doing drugs?"  "Oh no. I think... I'm... just..." I waited, but she never finished the sentence.  I asked for the check. I was starting to worry about the way that the color had gone out of her cheeks.  That was when it happened. I drank the wine, swallowed the infection down in big gulps and doomed myself.  She was right, though. I feel right... as...   I work for the city, cleaning the ancient floodwater systems beneath the streets. It's a creepy place, and at the beginning of every day, I have to do a sweep to check for people who've snuck in. They usually leave during the day, but the last thing you want to do is work overtime and be under when it gets dark. People get in. A lot of scary people live down there.  Downstream of Gibbs Market, some branches fell into the stream, then those caught a big mess of plastic bags blown in from the parking lot, and the whole thing got constipated faster than my 80-year-old father eating hotdogs on the Fourth of July.  I fixed it a little at a time but it took extra tools. After that many trips back to my van, I had lost track of time. When I came up, town had been transformed. There was a green glow to everything, especially the people. I don't know... how that happens to someone's skin. They were all *green.* How long do you have to be dead for your skin to turn that color?  Back into the sewers I went. I could only run and hide like a rat..  I heard them coming down the tunnels. In my hands, I held the big axe I use to break up the bigger logs. There were so many voices, though, I knew it would be no use... *almost* no use. I wonder if I'll feel it when I end myself.  If you find this note, tell my family that I love them.  And flush the storm drains.   Eight days ago, you could have found me over on the back porch of the Dillon Family ranch, ice cold beer in one hand, cigarette in the other and sweet, sweet Jessie Dillon sucking me off like a Hoover. That might be the last good memory I'll make now that the world's ended.  A real shame, too. The rest of the Dillons weren't too bright. That's probably why they didn't make it. Jessie, though... I tried to teach her like my Papa taught me. "Be ready for anything," he'd say. "'Cause the end comes at the time of his choosing, but it comes. It *always* comes."  And he was God damned right, too, nevermind all the shit they used to talk about him. What in the fuck is a "Prepper" anyway?  Well, last Sunday I shot a man for sneaking around on my property. He was all dressed up in a fancy black suit. I almost took his head clean off.  Then I recognized the clothes he was wearing. They were the ones we buried Papa's body in. Now, I've seen that before, in the movies. I'm glad I was ready for anything.  I went over to the Dillons' place and they were all acting crazy, screaming and trying to grab me and my gun as soon as they saw me in their living room.  I found poor Jessie. They got her too, but I couldn't pull the trigger. I like her.   I got her tied her up while I try to find the cure. There's gotta be something in this Bible that can fix her.   They're supposed to plan for this type of thing. Governments and security agencies are supposed to have plans in place. A *contingency*, they call it.  But it happened gradually. It spread so slowly that they couldn't even detect it. It wasn't until people started dying that it became apparent what was happening. By then it was too late. Of course, it happened on a Black Friday. Of all days. People crammed around the entrance of the mall, pushing, pulsing, moving in waves. One infected person became a thousand, and there was nowhere for them to run.  Maybe that was my savior, though, it being the biggest shopping day of the year. I was at work four hours earlier than usual, making my rounds when I heard them start moaning outside. Checking the monitors from the security station revealed just how bad it was.  I roused Mike, asleep in his chair, his little girl slumped in his arms -- the difficulties of being a single parent with odd hours. I suddenly wondered how they'd even made it there. I couldn't remember them coming inside.   "Mike. Wake up. It's bad. They've got us surrounded."  "Wha-? Of course we are. Did you forget what day it is?"  "Look at them out there. This is something different."  Mike set his daughter down and studied the monitors, frowning face bathed in the gray glow. Small figures tore each other apart in low-definition. "It's... I dunno. God. Oh, shit, God. Should we call the police?"  "We can't. We're on our own," I said as I offered him a pistol.  "Jesus! What the fuck are you doing with that thing?"  "Self defense. Something like this was bound to happen sooner or later. I felt it coming, so I prepared."  "You can't be serious. Put that down before you hurt someone. We just need to figure this out. Those are *people* down there!"  I put the gun back in my belt. "Come with me." Mike stared, unmoving. "I'll show you. You don't believe me? I'll show you real monsters." The tone in my voice didn't leave room for argument. Mike went to the next room to wake Casey.  "She's not moving!" he shouted. "Something's wrong with her, she's not waking up!"  As he knelt over her unconscious body, I quickly struck him on the back of the skull. A half hour later, he found himself on top of the roof.  "You're sick," he said.  "No, I'm not. And neither are you. They are, though." I gestured to the pirhanal masses below. "They're not human anymore, Mike. They're gone."  "Ca- where's Casey?" He tried to stand with numb legs.  "Casey's gone, Mike. I saw that bite. They're all gone. There's only one thing left to do."   My sister Tabitha has been called many things. "Strange." "A freak." "Unstable." To me, though, she's always been one thing: a burden.  Our parents weren't really around much growing up. Dad was always on the road and mom threw herself into her work as a doctor. That made me, the older sister, the adult. They've never accepted that Tabitha has a problem.  I lived at my parents' house until she graduated high school. I worked a minimum wage job to save enough for first and last month's rent on two apartments, at the same time as I helped her with her homework. My mother called me a freeloader and a waste almost every single day. Finally the day came and we left. I still had to keep an eye on my sister. There's no telling what kind of trouble she might get into.  I showed her how to shop. To do laundry. I even found her a job that she can do from her apartment. She wanted a pet, so we adopted a cat. An old gray Norwegian she named Frank. (It's short for Frankenstein. She's into gross, creepy stuff like that. I think she even posted here once or twice.) Frank was a girl, but it didn't matter to Tabitha.  Years went by. We found a sort of precarious balance. But when Frank died, she almost lost it. We got her another, a kitten this time. Then she found one on the street. Then two more. Then a litter of kittens. She tried to hide them from me, but eventually I found out. Four of the kittens were dead, hiding under her bed. I let her keep one, and the rest went to the Humane Society. It was a bad time for us. That was a few months ago.  She *is* improving, though. Most days I just call her on Skype to check in on her...  Yesterday, I called and she didn't answer. I'd just gotten off working a double, and almost just left it at that.  When I called again, she had this huge smile on her face.  "Frank came back!" she said so loud that it distorted the microphone.  "Frank?" There in her arms, I saw a gray Norwegian. "Tabby, no."  "He's back! He was just sick. See?"  Until then, I'd thought she might have dug up Frank's corpse, but this cat was alive, tail jerking back and forth. It did look a lot like Frank, except for the eyes. Even through the computer screen, I could tell that this cat's eyes were a striking green color.  "I'm coming over."  "No!" she screamed.  "Swear to god, Tabitha. I'm not going through this with you again. That cat isn't yours. We're taking it back."  She harumphed like a toddler. "Can't he just stay the night?"  My stomach growled and my soft, warm mattress called out to me from the next room. I sighed. "Fine. *One* night. Tomorrow, he's going back, though, and we're having a long talk about taking things that don't belong to you."  That was the last conversation I had with my sister. Please, if you know anything.... If you've seen her... I'm worried to death about her.   Chaplain? Hi, it's PFC Tucker.  I called earlier. Did you get my other message? Oh... okay. Well, we're headed back outside the wire soon, so this is going to kind of be like the last time I'll have access to a phone for a few days.  Anyway, it's about Private Webb. He's, uh, not doing so well, I don't think. We've all seen stuff. Scary, crazy stuff, but the last time we went into this village on a patrol, things went really tits up. Sorry, I, I mean... Well, yeah, they got bad.  They knew we were coming. That's not new, but these ones, I don't know what they were thinking...? They just came out of the buildings and started running for us, and I've never seen that before. We started putting them down fast. It wasn't, like, really a fight, but then somebody else outside the town started with the mortars.  Webb was in the first Humvee, right up front manning the .50 cal. That first mortar dropped right in the middle of the street. It hit the group of them running at us. Pretty good shot -- I mean, they were aiming for us, but they took out all their own guys. Must have got about six or eight of them. So Webb, he's got front row seats for this.   You ever seen someone get hit by artillery like that, Chaplain? Right, so you know, there's just... *parts* all over. The sand and dust clears and you can't even tell who's who anymore. Webb's seen that before, too. We all have.  Now, I'm about three trucks back, and it's time to get the fuck out of -- sorry, it's time to get out of there before the next round hits, so we're trying to turn around and hightail it, but Webb starts opening up on them. He used up everything he had, melted the barrel, just held down the trigger like they teach you not to do. The sound of the gun fades out, we're driving back out again, and you can just hear Webb screaming and crying like a madman.  He's like, "Why didn't they die?"  The guys in his Hummer got him to calm down before we got back. When I saw him, he just seemed kind of tired. I asked him if he was doing okay, and what happened back on that last mission... and he gave me this look. I've known Webb since basic, Chaplain, and I've never seen a look like that from him.  I think he's hiding something in his locker. He knows we're not supposed to loot the places we go to, but I think maybe he found something and kept it. I don't know. Maybe it's nothing. Just another month of this and we get to go back home, and maybe that's what he needs.  Maybe you could talk with him, though? Try and see if he's okay? I don't want to get him in trouble or anything. I'm just trying to help.   Chaplain? Hi, it's PFC Tucker.  I called earlier. Did you get my other message? Oh... okay.

Maybe just a personal opinion thing, but I'd lose that "******PART 2 WILL UPDATE SOON!!!11!!!****** stuff on the bottom. Just tag it as a series, and if anything say that you're going to try to find out more.  Good luck!   It's gone! :O   That's amazing! Very industrial-looking for a swimming pool because of the bare concrete. Looks like a place I'd have liked to play as a kid too.   Pool as in swimming pool?   To avoid a story that doesn't translate to spoken word very well, you could look for ones that have been read on YouTube. There are a bunch of channels.   Thanks!   Bolt cutters snapped the lock and it clattered to the floor.  I wore a mask, but the stench gagged me. My flashlight revealed so many bodies -- so many *more* than I'd imagined. Slumped over desks, onto the floor, several crowded around the door. Hollow eyes and limbs stripped to the bone. Where one corpse ended and the next began was indistinguishable.  Cold air and bad feelings washed over me as I stepped inside. An improvised tomb, that's what this was. A tomb for monsters, they damned humanity.  In this lab, they'd created the virus. It took over the brain, killing the parts that didn't serve its purpose like pain, fear, love, even death. It turned anyone, even your own family, into hellish fiends. All that remained were the basic instincts.  To kill.  To feed.  They'd tried to send a message -- maybe they had a cure. Papers were scattered on desks. Memos, notes, schedules. Nothing that could help. Anything important had been stored on their computer system, locked away forever.  In the large office at the end of the hall I found a handwritten note written on official-looking letterhead, splattered with blood. A used pistol laid on it like a paperweight.  The rest of you may keep searching for a cure. As for me, I believe that none exists. This sickness is designed by God, and we've been doomed according to his wishes. If you intend to stop the virus, you must kill God.  I heard bodies begin moving in the next room.   This wasn't where it started.  This was where the battle to save us was lost.   Oh whoah, thanks!   That little "how-to" booklet is the bees knees.   Everything that /u/Human_Gravy said.  Finish it. One discouraging thing is that you're breaking it into parts already. Why drag it out like that? Why not just tell the story you want and worry about formatting and organization later?  So what I think you should do is finish your first draft of this. There's some good news here: first drafts suck. It's not a big deal because no one is going to see it but you, and now you have someplace to start. Then re-read it. Then re-re-read it. And again. Then, when you've made edits and fixed timing and dialogue and cut out the weird distracting parts that aren't working, **then** ask other people what they think.  Don't ask them to write your story for you.  It might sound like a lot of work, but you've been carrying this idea around in your head for years, so don't be afraid to do it some justice.   The cost a good gripple is insane these days.      I hate this title and it doesn't really fit with any ongoing projects. Just had a thought and rolled with it.

Downstream of Gibbs Market, some branches fell into the stream, then those caught a big mess of plastic bags blown in from the parking lot, and the whole thing got constipated faster than my 80-year-old father eating hotdogs on the Fourth of July.  I fixed it a little at a time but it took extra tools. After that many trips back to my van, I had lost track of time. When I came up, town had been transformed. There was a green glow to everything, especially the people. I don't know... how that happens to someone's skin. They were all *green.* How long do you have to be dead for your skin to turn that color?  Back into the sewers I went. I could only run and hide like a rat..  I heard them coming down the tunnels. In my hands, I held the big axe I use to break up the bigger logs. There were so many voices, though, I knew it would be no use... *almost* no use. I wonder if I'll feel it when I end myself.  If you find this note, tell my family that I love them.  And flush the storm drains.   I just meant "huose." :P   Weird, it worked on /r/nosleepreruns (except the colors are backwards, oops).

Like wdalphin said, unchecked the box, and you'll see it in reddit's default CSS.  Another option is to use Pocket, a browser extension that's useful for a lot of things, but in this case, it can re-format the text in article view to make it easier to read.  Or even paste the URL into skimreddit.com, which also re-formats it for reading.   The idea is kind of fun. It just didn't have that immersive realism that nosleep is so good for. I couldn't suspend my disbelief. Maybe /r/Darktales would like this?   If they stopped updating on nosleep, it's safe to say that they died.   They got grazer and laser and all kind o -azers!   Huh. Interesting. I think you might be onto something there.   Someone's got to get out there for the rest of us to write about.   I know exactly how I caught it. They say it spreads through blood and saliva, and I know exactly the moment when it entered my body.  "That's expensive wine, you know" I said to my wife. It was our thirteenth anniversary and I'd taken her out to dinner at our favorite place we couldn't afford. She'd been just comatose all night. I'd bought the whole bottle, but she had only taken one sip from her glass. "If you don't drink it, I'm pouring it back into the bottle."  "Why don't you... just... drink it yourself?" she asked. Her eyes settled on me, unfocused, staring off into the distance.  "Are you okay?"  "Oh yeah. I feel... *greeeat*."  "Marie. Are you doing drugs?"  "Oh no. I think... I'm... just..." I waited, but she never finished the sentence.  I asked for the check. I was starting to worry about the way that the color had gone out of her cheeks.  That was when it happened. I drank the wine, swallowed the infection down in big gulps and doomed myself.  She was right, though. I feel right... as...

That's some city folk shit right there. Though that guy in blue did kind look like my Papa.   Yes!   In a good way, though... Right? *Right?*   Eight days ago, you could have found me over on the back porch of the Dillon Family ranch, ice cold beer in one hand, cigarette in the other and sweet, sweet Jessie Dillon sucking me off like a Hoover. That might be the last good memory I'll make now that the world's ended.  A real shame, too. The rest of the Dillons weren't too bright. That's probably why they didn't make it. Jessie, though...

I went over to the Dillons' place and they were all acting crazy, screaming and trying to grab me and my gun as soon as they saw me in their living room.  I found poor Jessie.

[Give this'n a look-see.](http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/283agt/both_my_parents_were_surgeons_and_i_used_to_talk/)   They're supposed to plan for this type of thing. Governments and security agencies are supposed to have plans in place. A *contingency*, they call it.  But it happened gradually. It spread so slowly that they couldn't even detect it. It wasn't until people started dying that it became apparent what was happening. By then it was too late. Of course, it happened on a Black Friday. Of all days. People crammed around the entrance of the mall, pushing, pulsing, moving in waves. One infected person became a thousand, and there was nowhere for them to run.  Maybe that was my savior, though, it being the biggest shopping day of the year. I was at work four hours earlier than usual, making my rounds when I heard them start moaning outside. Checking the monitors from the security station revealed just how bad it was.  I roused Mike, asleep in his chair, his little girl slumped in his arms -- the difficulties of being a single parent with odd hours. I suddenly wondered how they'd even made it there. I couldn't remember them coming inside.   "Mike. Wake up. It's bad. They've got us surrounded."  "Wha-? Of course we are. Did you forget what day it is?"  "Look at them out there. This is something different."  Mike set his daughter down and studied the monitors, frowning face bathed in the gray glow. Small figures tore each other apart in low-definition. "It's... I dunno. God. Oh, shit, God. Should we call the police?"  "We can't. We're on our own," I said as I offered him a pistol.  "Jesus! What the fuck are you doing with that thing?"  "Self defense. Something like this was bound to happen sooner or later. I felt it coming, so I prepared."  "You can't be serious. Put that down before you hurt someone. We just need to figure this out. Those are *people* down there!"  I put the gun back in my belt. "Come with me." Mike stared, unmoving. "I'll show you. You don't believe me? I'll show you real monsters." The tone in my voice didn't leave room for argument. Mike went to the next room to wake Casey.  "She's not moving!" he shouted. "Something's wrong with her, she's not waking up!"  As he knelt over her unconscious body, I quickly struck him on the back of the skull. A half hour later, he found himself on top of the roof.  "You're sick," he said.  "No, I'm not. And neither are you. They are, though." I gestured to the pirhanal masses below. "They're not human anymore, Mike. They're gone."  "Ca- where's Casey?" He tried to stand with numb legs.  "Casey's gone, Mike. I saw that bite. They're all gone. There's only one thing left to do."   I think that's Human_Gravy_Gravy. It's good on biscuits.   "God, why does this shit happen to me?" Malcolm drunkenly shouted, splattering the lid, seat, tank, floor, walls with the evicted debris from his bowels. A two foot chili dog, one gallon milkshake and hours of the worst beer that this hole-in-the-wall bar had to offer had created a deadly chemical reaction. He'd started with the hover -- the toilet was probably the worst in the Western Hemisphere, but had since achieved lift-off.  He clenched so long and hard that he nearly passed out. As his vision returned, mind empty of all thought, the words at the end of the long black tunnel were impressed upon his brain.  *"Don't worry. There are plenty of fish in the sea."*  Fog slowly cleared from his mind, and Malcolm recalled the fit brunette he'd been trying to catch the attention of at the bar outside. Clearly, an exercise in futility. He checked that the coast was clear before abandoning the stall.   *I'd take just about any kind of trout at this point,* he thought as we washed his hands in the sink.  Behind him, someone went rushing into the stall-slash-gateway-to-hell-on-Earth. "God, why does this shit happen to me?" said the newcomer.  Malcolm left that night with a slightly overweight blonde that he hadn't given a second look at before. Their shared affinity for food, Netflix and video games made them friends first and lovers second. Each fell hard and fast for the other, spending nearly every day of that week together.   It was going to last.   When the weekend came back around, they agreed to meet up at the watering hole that had brought them together. Too many Jger Bombs, and Malcolm found himself back in the stall. He was getting sleepy, and his aim was failing. On a drunken whim, he decided to back away from the bowl. He chuckled as he shot 50% from the line.  As he shook the last drops onto the floor, he noticed a new addition to the artwork on the walls.  *"Choose a job you love, and youll never have to work a day in your life."*  The gears of Malcolm's mind fell into place, lubricated by the words of his unknown mentor. He hated his job. Why do that to himself? The blocked portal of waste suddenly became a metaphor for his life -- down the drain.  Someone in a hurry bumped Malcolm on his way back to the table. The blow spun him, directing his gaze to an orange paper sign hung over the bar.  *"Bar for Sale."*  This could work.  After a month, Malcolm was living his dream. He'd purchased the bar, and it was pulling in more business than ever. Everything was flowing smoothly -- everything but the third stall toilet. He'd hung signs, of course, but you can't expect sloshed patrons on their way to give the old heave-ho to stop and read.  Still, he hated cleaning it. The putrid stink burned through his facemask. He nearly yakked himself. Through watery eyes, he saw new words scratched into the stall.  *"No need to worry. It will all be over soon"*  "Thanks, pal," he whispered to the air.   *I* should? It sounds like you've got it all figured out!  Edit: Okay.   I was thinking *Awesome, the_itch wrote a straightforward zombie story,* until "the undead screamed."  I pictured it on top of a shopping mall too. Maybe a Black Friday turned red?   ~~Fuck~~ Thank you very much!   Check out /r/nosleepworkshops for that!   Thanks! Exactly what I'd hoped to hear!   *(Today)*  I didn't kill my daughter. I didn't.  I understand, that when these things happen, you've got to look at the father, but you've got to believe me when I say I did not kill her.  This is all a... tragic accident. She must've found my gun, must've been playing with it in her room.  *Sobs*  Sorry, I can't do this right now.  ---  *(Yesterday)*  Today's the day.  Since Janine died last year, things have been getting worse and worse.  I can't stand the little brat. So entitled. So goddamned needy. Well, what about my needs, huh?  If she thinks that I've made her life hell, then she hasn't considered what it's like to have to live with her. This whole pile of shit just poured into my lap -- I didn't even want kids! That was Janine's thing.  She's ready now. Over this last year, I've worn her down.   Such a soft...   weak...   *coward*.  I'm not going to kill her. I don't have to.  Today I gave her the gun.   Spy! Who are you working for?   Better make it two-thirds. Easier to stop if it turns on us.   I have my phone chime every half hour to keep track of time. Oh yeah.   Thanks!   Not to mention that vampires (like Dracula) have been around for ages.   He donned the fitted mask, suit and gloves, careful to inspect the seams for weak points where the noxious gases could enter. It was Spring now, with snow still gripping onto the planet's surface. He was reasonably worried about exposure, especially in the long term. The young scientist was feeling better about his decision already. He could picture them, homeless, huddled cold and starving under the overpass near the park. The two serums clinked as he put them into his Velcro pocket. Two subjects. If he was right, one of them wouldn't spend another day down on the planet's harsh surface. And the other... Well...   Yes.

 Right, back in the day say the 90s, it really was a boom in paranormal on TV  I'm from the UK so the best we had was Strange But True, check out this archive...  https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL7D63E9D27340FF44  Then the US had various shows from Sightings to Unsolved Mysteries with Robert Stack  There were other themed shows like Outer Limits but not factual reconstruction TV shows  I would love to see the complete Robert Stack Unsolved Mysteries episodes but you can't stream any online thanks to the guys that own the modern inferior version hosted by Dennis Farina which changed the theme tune and gave it a very boring studio feel with non of the charm Robert Stack gave   Hey it's the off season so random stuff allowed  Will season 2 come around already, it's forever   Bruce Lee should have played some sort of super hero and had his own show  Instead he was sidekick to some douche and had to fight an inferior Burt Ward  Rumour is he didn't want to lose so they made him and Robin tie, way to go lol  Bruce would have kicked the hell out of Batman and the rest of the cast for sure  Bruce used martial arts to beat his opponents, Batman uses those wonderful toys         I am still on Windows 7 so am awaiting 10 very soon but will WMP be available in Win10 as know Microsoft have killed Media Centre so what of Media Player?  Seen they're having standalone apps for these tasks so is there a need for WMP, I have used it for years to transfer files to music device but version 12 hadn't really changed from XP and still had outdated options, codecs and functionality, it could have been so much more   They should have merged Media Centre with WMP and tied in massive downloads services like iTunes, think then Microsoft would've stayed relevant instead of getting lagged behind for many years    Is that Windows Media Player?   Can anyone list the available file formats Windows 10 will support when released?  I mean various formats from codecs / audio / video / image / office / PDF / zip files  Heard 10 will offer wider audio and video format playback as well as image viewing   Also, after the year, a physical version will still work while downloading after the year will be a paid upgrade so having a few physical copies dotted around is a good fail safe plus installing from physical media is a lot quicker than having to download the thing which could take overnight for some people   Not everyone has reliable internet connections so those without would be great to install the latest version without the hassle of outdated computers not being able to upgrade   Hi there!

 I can imagine that some users want their content to take off so bad that they downvote all above and below them on the 'new' page.    Thank you!   I just think this would be a really good way to disappoint a redditor.    I'm the hacker that fucked this all up.   Because it's an anti joke.   I predict that there will be some users that submit the survey more than once. I highly doubt there are users that are going to sit in front of this survey and fill it out 100 times.    You know, I'm not experiencing this. I just sorta came up with it. :)   Is there a similar website like ZenniOptical that you use for contacts that can get them to you at a low price?   The knife that went through it.    Thank you!   You PM him/her over a period of months until you gain their trust. You find out that they actually live in the same city as you, in fact, just a couple of blocks down. You share pictures of yourselves with each other, slowly piecing together your independent lives. You find that you have similar interests including vast collections of fedoras, novelty swords, and NES cartridges. You muster up the courage to let them know you have feelings for them. You find that they share the same feelings towards you. You share more intimate photographs with each other leading into ending every night with a message in your inbox that says "Goodnight, I love you, I can't wait to meet you."  You decide to take the initiative and set up a date together. You invite them out to the local Hilton restaurant for a fancy meal followed by a night out on the town on Monday, April 20th, 2015 at 6:00pm Central Standard Time.  You wait until the eve of that fateful night and never leave your driveway.    BOOO CAPTIONS   Yes, but what are the ratios and cooking instructions?   Don't pick it up bare handed!!!!  There is a flesh-eating bacteria that is present on those chunks!    Yeah!  I was a little curious after the shampoo washed out of my hair, down my face, and into my mouth. It was very salty!    Then I noticed that the shower gel is the same consistency! Naturally, I was curious about its taste so I tried it to compare. SAME FLAVOR, super salty!    That's when I looked at the ingredients. They are the same!     Yes, I could've skipped the second try but some minds work differently from others.   Yeah, I just found out that the Internet on campus is sluggish today. Sorry about that!    monoprice.com  Goddamn reddit hug...   I have a business proposal for all of you worried about the change:     Step 1: Buy all the Kraft Mac   Cheese you can **NOW**   Step 2: Wait a couple of months after the new mac hits the shelves   Step 3: Sell your stockpile at a premium   Step 4: Profit.   If you don't mind me asking, I have been trying to get into the IT world. How did you do it?      Any sort of special classes you took? I already have my bachelor's degree (in history) but I am great with computers. Like, I do IT work in my office for my coworkers.   You seem to know your bugs.  Would you mind informing me what kind of bug is in this amber I found?   http://youtu.be/fieTpX7DQE8  It's legit amber too. It was partially encased in rock and I cleaned up the stone.   I don't understand   Not really.   I can tell you this by experience. The body wash and shampoo of Spa-Haus taste the same. I then looked at the ingredients... the same.    Not sure why you're being downvoted... it completely ruined it!      Plus, how long am I supposed to leave it in the hot water?    It's because their last emperor's surname was Nguyen and it changing your family surname to match was respectful.  [Source](http://www.ibtimes.com/why-are-so-many-vietnamese-people-named-nguyen-1556359)  By the early 19th century century, the Nguyen Dynasty seized power in Vietnam (which unified the country), prompting yet another wave of surname changes and adoptions. That dynasty, which "awarded" their surname to many people, ruled the country until the end of World War II. Esther Tran Le, a Vietnamese-American journalist based in New York, said that the name Nguyen was the last name of the last dynasty of Vietnamese emperors. Apparently the last King's name was Bao-Dai, but his real name was Nguyen-Vinh-Thu, she said. Many of the Vietnamese [peoples] last names derive from the former Emperors' last names.   Reminds me of the Game of Thrones intro.   I'd call you all up and we'd have a giant circlejerk while listening to that song.  Kind of like right now.   Where did you see thin?   You'll never forget her.  You WILL learn to be okay with that.    This is the most finicky subreddit.    Hey Gordon!    You should visit my town sometime and slap some sense into restaurant owners around here. I swear we are becoming the burger joint capitol of the work. I think we have at least 13 mom-and-pop burger places for our 40,000 people.    A taco joint shut down and now someone bought the building and is turning it into ANOTHER BURGER PLACE...    We have no diversity! It's all burgers or Latin American food!    Sherman, TX. Future world record holder in burger places per capita.      "thank mr skeltal" to this message and spread it to 3 more circlejerk posts!        Or we just don't want to take part in a giant circlejerk about it.       Show some empathy.   I feel the same way!   It sounds like "ker thump" and then picks back up again!   What brought you to DC, what kind of job did you have, why did you decide to leave?   I think you are mistaken.    Before reddit Lemur was just 'mur'.      I hate having to need a car! Mine is a run down piece of shit.   I have a 4 year degree in history and I'm fluent in Spanish. Any way to get there and make it?    "Don't worry, we can fix the broken paw with an arrow through the head!"   Where'd you see that?   I ANAL? What does your sexual stimulation preference have to do with this!?   They are two factions in a game called "The Elder Scrolls: Skyrim".  You can choose to join either faction.    What did you choose? I chose the mayo.   WOOP! IT'S THERE! Thanks!   I just shrekd all over myself.   Hold up, are you saying that my iPhone 6 can also film at 60fps?

When he is on his deathbed about to have his final breath; whisper into his ear:  "I had gay sex with my boyfriend in your house."   Great question!  Honestly, I'm not sure about the IP address. I would assume no. What I meant by that in the post is that there is a survey site we were considering that had an option to only allow one vote from one IP address.   This poses an issue when it comes to schools and business. Effectively one vote can determine an entire school's opinion. We wanted to avoid that.   PLS   Hello /r/gifs users!   We've been receiving a lot of mod mail from you all regarding 'Power Users' (i.e. those who post content to /r/gifs 20-30 times a day). The complaint stems from other users' inability to submit content to our subreddit and collect the karma that these posts accumulate.   We've decided to create a survey and let you all decided if we should enact a post limit for users.   Please take five minutes out of your day to answer! There are two  questions that are mandatory and the rest are silly questions we've come up with to get to know our user base a little better.  The survey is open for all to submit answers to but **PLEASE ONLY SUBMIT IT ONCE**. We had the option to use a feature that only allows one vote from an IP address or allows only users with a Google account to vote BUT we decided that these features would hinder our users' votes.   **[LINK TO SURVEY](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1otfolOwCvjhUVtLo8lwvO5z3iZGWjkCm43b2XrMqIy8/viewform?usp=send_form)**  Thank you so much for your participation in this community and survey. It means a lot!  Sincerely,  test_subject4255  EDIT: I guess I should have mentioned a date at which the polling ends. How about a week from today?   Polling ends 4/23/2015 at 12:00pm Central Standard Time.   EDIT 2: **POLLING HAS ENDED. RESULTS WILL BE GIVEN SOON**   Gosh, I'm not great with the lingo.   When the song starts you hear "da da da daaaaaa daaaaa da da daaaaa daaaa daaa"  Know what I mean?    HIS IceQ 7870  Wow! How much are you asking?   Who is that? Where did you see that?   I thought he was the one singing the "das"      ABC [Texoma](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texoma)   It used to be called the 'I So Pale Ale' and then they changed it, no?   Oh yeah, duh! Thanks!   link us!   I don't think OP claimed to have seen it.    I once tried to download an episode of Chappelle's Show but instead got the Paris Hilton sex tape.    Is Buzzfeed spilling over? All these clickbate titles...      I usually bitch about captions but I think this gif is an exception. Great job!   I think we should just confiscate all guns. No guns = no illegal selling of the weapons, no confusion whether or not you're holding a taser, no gun related deaths.    Please give me some sources that say more white men are shot/killed by police than black men.    But it does! You don't see white men getting shot by police.    Idk, maybe he was afraid? Fight or flight?   Doesn't warrant a death sentence.    I don't understand. Why would you shoot the guy if he's being held to the ground? Taser or not?    Comments are in response to posts.    Corey Stoll should've been cast as Lex Luthor.    ~~If you ever let anyone shoot a firearm for the first time, full auto or not. ALWAYS LOAD ONE ROUND. That way they can see if the will be able to control the recoil without endangering themselves or others around them.~~  How about we just not let children play with firearms?    [The MENSA one was pretty funny too!](http://www.adultswim.com/videos/the-eric-andre-show/mensa-convention/)    That's the beauty of it.    That donut looked like it was made of plastic.   Neat.   And where is the bidet?    BOOOO, waste of time.   He's preventing others from getting their food by acting like a child. I think the manager was calling him out on his bullshit because nobody else will.    Not really.   Just all of a sudden.   Bullshit, he's just trying to get the reddit vote.     My toenails are kinda cool in the sense that they will grow to a point and stab the toenail next to it. If I don't trim them, they start killing my other toes.      I want to stand in it.    So this is what /r/combinedgifs will be for some time, that seen from GoT mixed with other scenes from different films/TV shows...  I see it now.      Weird, it's like every time there's a cop that murdered an innocent black man reddit has a post on the front page the next day that shows a cop doing a good deed.   Stop trying to change the subject.    "iShit" here   I call that folder 'iShit'   BOOO CAPTIONS!   Ask the grill man!   The show sucks   Come at me bro   Redditors are salty.   Probably America.    I don't get it.   Where'd you hear that?   Wtf is the point of all the old clips? They add nothing.   What's the last thing that was cooked on you?   HOLY CRAP THAT IS EXPENSIVE!   What game is he playing?   Link me!!!   Fookin' noice wan.   What middle school did you go to? I recall a similar experience.    Attach a hair dryer to the bowl!

No other rooms are available and they are comping my night.   And the canned laughter! I don't need to be reminded when to laugh at a joke! Well, with that show, not even canned laughter could make me chuckle.    BOOOOOOO CAPTIONS!   Sooooooooooo??? Did you get canned?    their friend*   WELL DONE! No captions! :D   I swear every other gif on this subreddit is 'how a gun works'  WE GET IT.    hahahaha   Time to initiate Helios One.    It was a thing that maybe happened 2-3 times.    As a former dumb. What were we talking about again?   (702) 385-7912   [REQUEST] GTA V   I know. It's posted as a request nonstop. Let me tell you why I'm different! I'm not.  I just simply don't have the money to purchase a game that I know I will enjoy. I've been a huge fan of the franchise and put a lot of hours into GTA: San Andreas when I had it for Xbox. I never really appreciated GTA: IV because I'm a big fan of flying airplanes and I feel like Liberty City is confined.  San Andreas has been my favorite one out of the series because of its size and GTA: V is the closest sequel that mimics it. I want to rob stores, steal fighter jets, take flying lessons, etc. and I know this game will offer it all to me.  Plus, my SO would be ecstatic considering we first connected with her love of driving down sidewalks.  Thank you for considering me.   http://steamcommunity.com/id/jrockbarn/   I like it!

They have already been processed so my body does less work in scavenging the precious vitamins and minerals left behind from the previous tenant. I've refined it so much that I've stopped shitting, there is nothing left to process. The 'waste not diet' is the one you should really be on.    It took me about 3-4 weeks to get over my sugar withdrawals. It's crazy. You'd have to experience it to believe me.    I get where you are coming from. Yes, it is a disgusting thing.   If you just try and realize what conditions need to be like for you to willfully take the life of endangered species maybe you'd see that it's probably not what they want to do but is what they must do in order to survive.  On the same note, there is a market for what they do. If you destroy the demand the supply will go with it. This is something that the Chinese government is trying to work on.   You came off as super critical of his actions.    Learn how to empathize. Put yourself in his shoes. I wouldn't be able to think straight.

 Hey man wrong subreddit, I think you're looking for /r/circlejerk   Thank you Panama Canal.    Don't know if these are old by some standards, but Rome/Medieval 2 total war and Halo: CE. They got me started.   See Terminator 3.   Yeah I mean if he/she were voiced it would be interesting, but I don't care one way or the other.   Keep in mind, it's not Bethesda's style to force a companion on you for more than a quest or two.    Things AP Euro taught me.      Europe is on the 24 hour clock too you moron.       Fuck Islam    So off topic it belongs on /r/cringe    I've seen exactly this comment before.    I have a London Fog legal pad!    That moment when you realize your life is just circle jerk in action.    That would have been a good phrase for a tombstone.    All joking aside, I meant fatal in the sense of they were in an accident in which someone died. Not necessarily them.    I'm looking for the exception.    Yeah. Heard from Robin Williams that wifi in heaven is worse than Comcast.    Only in the sense of "fatality".    What does it feel like though, thinking you're about to get hit?   Yours, and hers if you know.   Did you see it coming, or was it something you only noticed retroactively?   	23
 How do you match up with people then? I built an army of 40k soldiers, 20k archers and 30k Knights and I've still been wiping the board clean at nation level with those numbers and now I'm at less than half of all those and still winning    Here's a direct link to the group. This should be in the sidebar IMO http://palringo.com/i/Ajy79Q/AK3_Rg   Wait, what? What's the source on this?    This is what I always did. I felt like I was too tired to really get anything done on my first day off so it was more of a recuperate and be lazy day   I'm the same exact way. My wife gets pissed because I'm making a mess but she doesn't understand that I do things in steps. Usually I'm throwing stuff together that's going to sit in the oven for at least 20 minutes except if it's pizza. Then I have all that time to clean everything up. I clean when I have time to lean   Most places I've worked at had pretty strict policy about cameras on their property    I bought a big bag of parmesan the other day because it's cheaper to buy in bulk. I use enough of it that I don't like buying in small amounts but I don't go through it fast enough to use it without freezing it. So I sat there and portioned all the parmesan into smaller freezer bags so it doesn't go bad. I felt like I should be back in a restaurant doing morning prep before we open   Uh oh, I used to work at a sandwich shop that got deliveries through them.    Why dig up rabbit holes? Doesn't that destroy the hole and then no more rabbits? I just make a bunch of traps and lay them on top of holes and when I come back I usually end up with an entire inventory of rabbits    My wife and I started playing with her brother and while each of us are not bad at the game by ourselves, we don't seem to be the best at doing it together. The wife died three times, and her brother and I died once. She survived the rest of the first winter just barely and was able to revive me and that's where we are now.   I've been trying to focus on food supply but I'm finding it difficult to feed 3 people. I've been trapping rabbits like crazy but I haven't been able to build any kind of food surplus, we're always just barely getting by at the end of the day. I have two bee boxes but I don't want to use the honey because adding one honey to any of the recipes with a morsel makes honey nuggets which isn't nearly as filling as meatballs. I haven't really found a good way to get full sized meat to make honey ham   It's the only entrance to the living room area so we at least need to be able to move it easily. Something that's at least as high as the couch seat and he can't push it out of the way   Unfortunately we don't have a table so the breakfast nook is all we have for a place to eat besides the couch. We have smaller wooden barstool type chairs but he was able to grab onto one of those and pull then over because they're so light. The pool noodle is a good idea, I think one of those should cover all the ends   Our living room is pretty secure but the only thing that remains keeping him in here is a gap between the couches at a 90 degree angle. For a little while we had a little bouncer seat we'd turn sideways and that would keep him in here but now he figured out how to move it because it's pretty light.   [here's the spot in question] ( http://www.imgur.com/HEQUazQ.jpeg)   As you can see he heads straight to the rod iron chair which happens to be where our cat likes to store his toys at. I think by the time he's old enough to jump up onto the couch and get off the other side we'll be more okay with him wandering the kitchen, my only worry would be him falling on those rod iron chairs, but they have been in the wife's family for a long time and have been through 6 babies/kids   As a husband who works 5am to 3-4pm Mon-fri, I envy your position. I'm not saying it's easy, but it on weekends I generally am the primary caretaker for our son and I love spending the time with him. It's far more enjoyable than being gone 10 hours a day and being exhausted (physical job)  when I get home. I'd rather be hanging out with him all day   It just seems like any time I see posts like this on on reddit, it's filled with condescending comments about how bitcoin is the future and this will never be an issue with bitcoin. I suppose maybe it's different because this is /r/Android. Don't get me wrong, I'm a proud supporter of bitcoin and I've done a fair share of mining, but I just hate seeing people be douches about it   I'm not sure. Clans seems to fill up pretty quick. I wouldn't mind being in one but I don't have the dedication some of these crazy people have   So you just keep your screen on all night?    I'm wondering if he meant 1 week after researching it. Sounds more reasonable but still crazy   You're probably being booted from the clan. I guess some clans are trying to be competitive to get the most skulls by the end of the week to earn the 10k gold or whatever    Starting from nothing? Good god man   I've been playing for about a week, have almost. 200k population but I am less than 1% of the way to the wonder. At this point it's hard to build my population, my max food isn't enough to make 10k population, so obviously I'm building 10k barns at a time, but I'm only able to do 10k pop the first time after the barns go up, then it's immediately not enough   I'd go with food. I'm not even close to getting a winder yet, but I have about 197k citizens and over 100k of then have to be working on damn farms so everyone doesn't starve   I prefer wangnumber   I was almost expecting to see the bitcoin brigade all over this thread   Self destruct in 10...9...8...   Almost that entire list is /r/gifsound   I had about that much saved when I got to university, and then proceeded to blow all of it on college tuition. I probably would have been a lot better off had I never gone    I didn't even notice at first   Thanksobama.jpg   While we're on the subject of video play, can we get more of them? I'm not buying in-game gold, but I have no qualms with watching an ad to speed things up   Damn, filled already    He goes through a few stages. First he babbles and rolls around, then he takes his pacifier and starts banging it on the sides of the crib. Sometimes he throws the pacifier out of the crib or drops it down the back side which sends him into the second stage. If he's still holding the pacifier he'll start getting upset that it's not in his mouth and he'll also start rubbing the crap out of his eyes and then move onto stage 2.   Stage 2 is more rolling activity, even more eye rubbing and moans and groans that slowly climb in their volume and intensity  Stage 3 comes after the breaking point of stage 2 and now he's crying but not CRYING. This stage will also rise in intensity until the next stage  The last stage is inconsolable crying and hyperventilating.   He will successfully climb through these stages by himself without assistance or intervention, and sometimes even if we are patting him on the or talking to him he still may get to stage 4. I can count on one hand how many times he has gone to bed peacefully. By far the best time was when we were visiting his grandparents and it was near bedtime when we were coming home so we changed him into his jammies there. He cried on the way home but fell asleep in his car seat. I was able to successfully get him out of the car seat without waking him up and transfer him to his crib. But I don't think car rides right before bed is a habit I want formed   His wake up time is around 8 or so. He'll eat around 830-9, then nap time around 10, lunch at noon, nap around 2, and dinner between 430-5. Then around 8 is bath time if he needs one, then he gets his last bottle while he gets read a bedtime story and he's in the crib by 9. It has been that routine since he was 2 months basically and he still won't go down easily for naps or bed time   He'll start rolling and moving around, sometimes sitting up. If he isn't rolling around and he's on his tummy, he will refuse to lay his head down. Then he starts making sound, moans and groans at first. Then it turns to a whining cry, then an actual cry, and it progresses like that until he's plugged up his nose with snot, and either hyperventilating or screaming the most wretched scream you've ever heard. That's if we leave him to his own devices. But sometimes being there and patting him or talking to him also makes him upset. This kid just does NOT want to sleep.    My son is coming up on 10months and he's great during the day but nights are a spectacle to behold. Putting him down to sleep is worthy of a competition for who can do it the fastest. We've had the same exact bedtime routine since he was 2 months and he's not any better at going to bed or for naps now as he was then. He does nothing but fight it and refuses to self sooth. I've looked up sleep training but I don't see anything different with that than what we've already been trying. Once he's asleep, he almost always sleeps until morning but if for any reason he wakes up in the middle of the night, he will not go back to sleep for any reason. He does not sleep like a baby, he sleeps like a Vietnam War veteran with one eye open and the other on his pistol on the nightstand   I hope he didn't try to eat it by holding the stick.

The 623s run a little under a half size too big for me so I have to get insoles for them. Other than that, my only complaint is the lack of support for keeping my heel in the shoe   This thread upsets me because I really like the look of the 623s. They're the only sneakers I've found that don't look gaudy and awful. I really like the blue 623v2s   You have 3 unopened pairs of women's 587's?   Are you shitting me? I got a pair of 623s a few years ago (looks similar to those) because they were the only non-gaudy sneakers I could find.

Especially when they talk about wrestling or Dota for am hour   I'll refer you to my first sentence of my last post:  Laws don't always make sense.   I did it for two years and never got in trouble and I had already knew what I would say if I was reprimanded in any fashion for looking out for my own safety.    Laws don't always make sense. Bikes on the road are no better than someone walking on the road as far as safety goes. I'd argue it's actually worse because there's less chance of a person suddenly swerving out in front of you to avoid a rock in front of them. When I rode a bike in Bozeman, I rode on the sidewalk because I don't want to be killed from behind by a car and if I were to run into a pedestrian, it is far less deadly than a car hitting me   Watamote op   I wasn't referring to this specific event   This guy is probably just mad because his buddy owns the Wagon Wheel and runs on double the margins that other grocery stores run on   Similar story here.

There's Ranch in that vegetable tray   Fuck I was gilded last week   And today by far has been the worst of it. He has been incredibly difficult to feed, trying to squirm out of eating the solid foods and many times outright refusing his formula, and even if he does drink it, it will be like an ounce at a time on his own terms. He has always gotten 6oz of formula 4 times a day and he hasn't had a problem with it until very recently.   On top of this, his sleep has never been worse. Putting him to bed at his normal time works fine but if he wakes up for any reason at all you might as well give up on getting sleep for the rest of the night because no matter how tired he is, he won't fall back asleep. For at least the last week he has been waking up 4 hours after getting put to bed and is up crying the rest of the night unless you give up and take him downstairs and let him be awake. He's cranky all day long because he's tired and yet he refuses to sleep and even naps are half hour if you're lucky.

 Nice use of color and motion!      One Dozen Eyes - Island   I noted in the description that I'm trying to find alternatives, like day-care or walkers. I have time outside of work to take care of it, and I understand it can't be left alone for 10 hours. So, would taking it to day-care while I'm at work be sufficient?   What kinds of stories, if you don't mind my asking?   Right, absolutely. Thanks :)   I'm definitely planning to rescue an adult (don't feel like dealing with having to look after a hyper/destructive puppy). So hypothetically, if I could run with my Husky for 2 hours after work, would that be sufficient? I don't think I can leave it alone for 10 hours...   As for dog walkers, what would be the best way to go about that? Have the walker take the Husky for a walk or two every day while I'm at work?   Well, on the weekends, sure I could run with it (maaaaybe not 50 miles). But during the weekdays, isn't that what the day-care would be for?   ... good one   So I really want a Husky, but I'll be working full-time soon, meaning I'd be out of the house close to 10 hours per day. It's also not a big house, and has no fenced-in yard.  What can I do to make getting a Husky possible? Would taking it to a doggy day-care every weekday be okay for the dog?   I want an energetic dog that I can run with. I also think bigger dogs are adorable (which I acknowledge isn't the best reason for getting one).   I'm about to start working full time in a suburban area in Washington state; I'll be living alone and out of the apartment for 9-10 hours every weekday. I want a dog for companionship though, and am willing to do the needed grooming and exercising (1-1.5 hours per day), though I don't think I'll have a fenced-in yard.  I really want a Husky. I'd likely get an adult rescue (not a puppy); would it be too demanding?  Otherwise, other breeds I'd be interested in are Mastiffs, Australian Shepards or Shiba Inus. Would any of those suit my lifestyle better?   Edit: If I were to get a dog walker to walk the dog around midday (so the dog would never be alone for more than 4 hours or so), would a Husky be out of the question?

 The question is whether this thing is going to choke on any kind of multitasking even though it's a 4-threaded CPU. For example, let's say I have several programs running at once: can I compile a program and watch Youtube without the machine stalling? Can I listen to Pandora or 8tracks in the background while I am doing work? The reason why this is an important question is because the OG Macbook Air was absolute shit at multitasking.   People have also been charged with dui for sleeping in their vehicle with the keys not in the ignition.   The problem is that the study is inconclusive and warrants more research (great!) but science writers were breathlessly jumping to conclusions without having read a single sentence of the actual article. That's really embarrassing, considering that a journal article costs ~$30 and takes a science journalist maybe a day to skim the intro, methods, and conclusions. I'm a scientist, and while I'm eager to learn about scientific topics outside of my expertise from the media, I'm starting to think that I should only read reports from the news sections of Nature and Science.   The fact that a huge percentage of Instagram accounts are public and you can hashtag anything for people to see makes it amazing. Like Twitter but without the noise. I posted a random picture of cupcakes that I had made one weekend and it had likes from random people across the world. Wouldn't happen with any other platform.   Can you think of any major ad-based social network (say, 1-10M+ users) that went under? Off the top of my head I can only think of Myspace and Friendster. Another one (Orkut) had a buyout exit from Google. By all accounts Twitter is doing fine too.   Yes, but a huge part of medical costs are independent of labor (eg. doctors). The doctors and nurses could plausibly take less pay, but how would you pay the bills for infrastructure, equipment, and drugs?   Pro tip: buy a Cuisinart ice cream maker and her ice cream recipe book. Has many of the flavors featured in the shops.   Rapid tooling is pretty popular nowadays. Big companies may outsource to these ones for their parts. The law stipulates a requirement for repairs and parts, so I think some kind of turnaround time is reasonable.   This is a non-issue. If the plaintiffs win, the subsidies will continue in "state-established" exchanges and the insurance companies will see their money from the federal government regardless. Red states that "opted out" will suddenly see millions of working and middle class people lose their subsidy overnight. Because the individual mandate hasn't been shot down, the only way out would be for (a) states to implement their own subsidy and hit their own budgets, or (b) to swallow their dignity, set up an exchange, and let the federal government foot the subsidy bill.  Either way it goes back to the status quo. I don't know why people make it out to be a doomsday scenario. So long as the individual mandate stands and people want health care, politicians will come up with a crafty scheme.   That number means less than you think. The Russian revolution (and others for that matter) that happened 100 years ago started with way less people. You just need a very determined group of people beyond a critical mass. The vast majority of the public just want to go on with their lives and don't care either way who is in charge. They may not necessarily agree with a revolution but they won't go out of their way to stop it either.   I think that depends on what your definition of "fine" is. From looking at the list of "post-Soviet" country, none of them would be considered a "failed state". None of them turned into a Middle East shitshow. That's pretty good, all things considered and also considering the whole Bosnia thing that was not too far away.  That said, Putin did improve the economy by quite a bit by using the muscle of oil. Can't really blame him for that, since that was basically Canada's MO for the past 20 years. The only problem was that he let the power go to his head and there was no real plan to diversify the economy. As Canada is now also learning, oil is great when it's booming but you don't want to depend on it.   That was what wolves did at first. They just started way before cats did.      There are a lot of physicians who end up recording by a recorder (tape, or digital) and having someone else transcribe later. This could end up saving a lot of time. I think primary care would also help by having a "medical scribe" be there to write down all information and what happens during the appointment so that the physician isn't distracted. Sure, it costs more but probably pennies compared to other things in health care.   You have to go much farther than that because people can paint guns however they want. If you want to address this specific issue then you have to outright ban toy guys that have any resemblance to a real gun.   The only way would be for the whole world to collectively stop resorting to violence as a first line response to conflict. This doesn't just apply to world governments, but everyday people.   Honestly, I don't see what was wrong with the deal. It is a paid app (already generating revenue), and $40k/15% is a steal for an app that people are already paying for.   Fluoride is one of the best things you can do with regards to the "risk to benefit ratio". You are very unlikely to overdose on fluoride except in really special circumstances. In terms of other things you can add to water, I would put minerals on top of the list. Some people really hate hard water, but I think it would go a long way and it's practically impossible to overdose on it.   I think it's ridiculous that things such as not disclosing funding sources can still happen. Virtually all institutions have an office of sponsored research that manages all incoming grants (to get a piece of that sweet overhead, amongst other things). It should be trivial for institutions to publicly disclose all grants that fund a particular researcher so that issues such as these will never come up.   I have a question that's been on my mind for some time. When I lived in Germany about a decade ago, the one thing that I noticed a lot was substantially less Roma people compared to other "Western European" countries (eg. France, Spain, Italy). Why is that?   How long ago was this? In the past two institutions that I've worked at lab credit cards basically didn't exist anymore. That or they were such a pain to use it was not worth the hassle.   Not to mention virtually all postal offices are understaffed. Labor is expensive, especially if they are unionized. Where are they going to get people to do all this extra work, and would revenues from banking pay for that kind of trouble? Consumer banking isn't exactly a growing industry. The only way this would make sense is if they had a "branchless" banking system.   I think the more incredible thing is to consider what other shit is happening. Think about it: the NSA are not the only players in this game. Every country with a major cyber budget is probably doing the same thing. At this rate I'm sure most computers in the world are hacked by one government or another.   You don't need to even cross-breed apples. Apple trees derived from a seed will look nothing like its parent. That's why many apple varieties are just grafts.   I mean, this is essentially a microwave:  http://www.nuwaveoven.com/   Also, wouldn't the microwaves interfere with the operation of an infrared camera?   Here's the thing. He's 52 and been with the Daily Show since 1999. He has more money than he needs. It's really the perfect age to retire if you have money because you have the health to do fun things with his family and the means to do so. I don't fault him for making that decision -- many people may worship him, but at the end of the day it's still just a job to him. In fact I applaud the fact that he arrived at this decision at his age, rather than at 70 years old and in poor health.   That really depends on a lot of factors. Because $35k/y is a pretty comfortable lifestyle, literally everything you make from whatever career you choose will be pure profit. I don't think most people who have that kind of funds sit around and do nothing. My guess is they would try to find new and unconventional ways to have more income because they wouldn't be bound by risk.   It would have to be ridiculously lower than a $30k car. How many people buy new cars? The price comparison should be towards used cars.   Is this an American thing? I am Chinese and grew up in Canada. By and large most Asian restaurants on Canada are pretty clean. But in the USA there seems to be a huge amount of really dirty ones alongside the nice ones.   Chinese Canadian here. There are literally millions of Asian restaurants who are able to make duck well without violating health and safety issues. Many of them are new to Western culture too.    Isn't 35 pretty mediocre when you take into account all fully developed and mostly developed countries into account?   The exceptions to the trend as described by OP have been the American and Canadian olympics. We've actually been doing quite a fantastic job of breaking even.   It's also pretty ridiculous, considering that alternatives to neonicotinoid pesticides are organophosphates which are way more toxic to pretty much every animal.   Here's the thing: industrial farming absolutely requires the use of pesticides. What are you going to use if you completely ban neonicotinoids? Go back to organophosphates? Keep in mind that neonics were developed because of toxicity in mammalian species.   Public health policies are by design somewhat against complete civil liberty. Because infectious diseases and their prevention is basically a public good, all citizens participating in society must take part otherwise it won't work at all. The only way to enforce rates of vaccine compliance at rates required for herd immunity requires the government to step in. You can't free market your way into 90%+ vaccination rates without some sort of involvement from the government.   It's kind of a bad article. Like you said, you could argue that the weight gain was solely caused by the absence of CD-related digestive issues. Suddenly she's absorbing a lot more calories, so she would naturally gain weight. Unless they adjusted her diet accordingly I don't see how they could come to the conclusion that there is such a thing as an "overweight" microflora.   Why are you making it hard for yourself? Just put nail polish or something similar on the cable's pins.   The question is why doesn't the US even try to attempt to convince the Saudi government to reign in their religious extremists? I'm convinced that there is a huge split between the Saudi government and their rich nutjobs, but why does it seem like nobody wants to do anything about it? The US government at least tries to help out Pakistan with their terrorist problems.   How about this: That 1% or 2% skim milk you're drinking is actually skim milk with the fat put back in.   Even better: The LA metropolitan area has a larger population than the combined population of every Canadian metro area with a population of over 1 million.    Because the intruder knows that you don't need great aim to defend yourself with a shotgun.   Actually, if flu vaccine supplies were not an issue, then having mandatory yearly flu shots would greatly reduce health care costs.   It's also ridiculous to think that humans were at the pinnacle of health and were perfectly evolved to be in dietary harmony with their environment. Except for very few cases, organisms have evolved to be just good enough to have offspring due to the dynamic nature of evolutionary forces. Ancient humans were eating to *survive*.   I think it helps to understand it from their perspective. You are basically the child of your godmother's sister. She must have suffered so much by losing her sister, and all of that trauma is wrapped up in her fear of losing you too.   It's pretty much the entire West coast of Canada and the US. I live in the richest area of the US and there are still problems with the homeless and mentally ill. People here easily have the resources to make a huge dent in terms of getting housing and health care for the homeless, but unfortunately by and large rich people don't want to contribute towards the public good. Another great proxy for this is that the roads here are literally falling apart, public transit is abysmal, and the streets are disgustingly dirty.   Chinese here. Lost the fucking lottery -- I have wet ear wax and my armpits smell.   Not to mention that all the irritation and ingrown hairs looks pretty gross. If you can pull it off, fine, but seeing red razor bumps makes me gag a little.   Yes, but even in protein purification preps for difficult proteins nobody would ever suggest an aggressive shear by vortexing. They would suggest denaturation but never anything outside of "mild" for refolding.   It's interesting, because in 99% of molecular biology labs you are taught to *in no uncertain terms* not shear your enzymes and proteins by vortexing them.   I don't know if this will help you feel better about the world, but here's a fun fact: the vast majority of relationships in this world have never had a problem with fidelity. If you have been cheated on multiple times, perhaps it is because you are dating very similar types of women that would increase these unfortunate odds by a lot. Try broadening your horizons! Date someone completely different than your usual "type"! You might be pleasantly surprised.   I'd just like to point out that the expectation of fidelity wasn't so insane throughout most of human history. There are plenty of genetic genealogical studies done that estimate levels of extramarital children (which is a proxy for infidelity) and it appears to be a rarity. Pair bonding was also one of the major evolutionary factors that set us apart from chimpanzees and made us pretty pacifist compared to them.  What is different today, however, is that in modern society there are probably more humans alive than all of history combined. That means the number of people you interact with is now vastly larger. Obviously that's a huge psychological and sexual pressure that is being tested today and I don't think anyone really knows the answer to that yet. Today, it still seems like the vast majority of relationships have no problems with fidelity. We do hear more about alternative relationships, but that could also be due to easier modes of self-reporting and people just being more transparent about their lifestyles.    I think a lot of people assume that narcissism is synonymous with having a huge ego. A lot of times it is actually manifested as crippling insecurity.   Well, they did dump nuclear waste off the SF bay for a while. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farallon_Islands   Not quite. They'll still make plenty of money from Enterprise customers. They realized that they could sacrifice a little bit of revenue to bring everyone up to a newer release, and make up for it in other revenue streams.   Think bigger. Imagine remote assistance for surgeries. Telesurgery with the camera on the HoloLens to an outside team.  Anything that requires logistics will benefit greatly from this. Imagine a Search and Rescue team with these headsets!   The big issue is that the "social benefit" of these satellites rapidly declines as countries improve. You are spending a fuckton of money for something that is unsustainably expensive to maintain and improve. Once developing countries get off the ground, they will demand better/faster internet. They will start building their own cell towers for mobile broadband. After a very short period of time these hundreds or thousands of satellites will become completely obsolete for any useful application.  Contrast this with a vaccine that costs pennies or drugs for malaria. Your "social ROI" is way better because you spent very little and gained a lot. You basically spent pennies for literally 60 years of productivity. You can't say that about ho-hum satellites.  Google and SpaceX are playing the philanthropic angle, but it's all PR. It's a PR move for SpaceX to show their capabilities.   I've been here for a long time. I remember when getting 100 karma for a comment was a big deal. A thread with 1k+ comments was pretty rare. Now both of these are regular occurrences.  Edit: There were also *a lot* more Ron Paul fans back then too.  Second edit: I'm pretty sure memes like f7u12 and advice animals played a big part in how reddit transformed through the years.   Probably a great VR application too.   Holy shit, I tried explaining this to some people, who reply with "If I use my turn signal then people will immediately box me in!" WTF?   There seems to be a lot of small molecule inhibitors with great results recently. I wonder if people will now follow this route more than trying to make antibodies against cancer genes?   I fucking wish the USA and Canada would have something even resembling a European Doener kebab. I lived in a tiny Franconian city a decade ago and I still have dreams about them. The "shawarma" here doesn't even come close.   Where in the Bay Area are you living? There are decent 2br apartments in Palo Alto and Mountain View that are way less than $5k/m. I guess you prefer a house but given that most places here have tiny yards, I don't think the cost differential is worth it.   Not sure why you're being downvoted! A real question would be how animals are treated before slaughter for meat. There are probably more people in India who would look down upon the entire North American continent for eating cows. People should really watch the South Park episode about dolphins and whales before passing judgment. And this is speaking as an Asian living in North America for practically his whole life. People eat what they eat.   I think there's a big difference between the protesters' expectations versus fundamental realities. Their expectation is that sudden shocks to people's routines will magically make them follow your cause. That's just a lot of magical thinking. I sincerely believe that idealists have a moral obligation to be pragmatic, because then otherwise all you will do is alienate or cause people to take extreme positions for or against you.   Sure, if you block traffic you will be able to bring some attention to your cause, but if at the same time you make 80% of the people you affect take an extreme position against you then you are actively doing harm to what you want to achieve.   If you want real systemic change, what you really want is to *change opinions*. If your mode of protest achieves the exact opposite then you are really just being selfish and acting out on what I would describe to be "instant gratification" activism.   Activists really need to ask themselves some hard questions: what do they want to achieve from their actions? What are their concrete goals? If what they do does not realistically move the needle towards them, then maybe they should sit down a while longer and hash out some better ideas. I'm not saying that disruption is necessarily a bad idea, but it is applied in many cases where it completely backfires. Especially when you are talking about a city like Boston, where the racial problems are not even comparable to other "big cities" like LA, Chicago, or NYC.   Also, most blacks in the USA have little connection to Africa aside from skin color. They're more American by descent than most whites in this country. Why would anyone call them African in the first place?   Your point may have been valid 10 years ago, but bandwidth today is so cheap to deploy and the "pipes" are so wide that it is extremely hard to get significant amounts of network congestion that is caused by your neighbors. Cable internet (DOCSIS) is so ridiculously fast for the average home user there is no reason to even have tiered pricing.   If you order from Thorlabs you get a nice box of snacks!   Or that's a really tiny child's guitar.   I don't know why you're being downvoted. Microsoft can implement exactly the same approach for Windows with regards to updates or state autosaving. They just choose not to.   If they were all about good intentions then all they would have needed to do is implement a version of the "dead man switch". You have to come back after winding it up for X minutes. If you don't your car gets towed. The switch gets reset when the car leaves so you can't wind it up forever and leave it for the next person.    If you are doing the quick and dirty DNA extraction with NaOH/EDTA, then you will absolutely need to neutralize with Tris before you put it into the PCR. Unless you diluted the extraction by a ton then the NaOH is going to interfere with the PCR.  Also, everything I say doesn't really matter if you got the genotype that you were looking for. Did you use any +/- controls for mouse tails with known genotypes in the same DNA prep and PCR reaction?   What are you doing with the DNA afterward? If your DNA is purified, having it being extremely alkaline doesn't do anything except denature it and so it will still be good for PCR. EDTA at pH 8.0 doesn't do anything bad or degrade the sample.   I thought seasons 3-5 were the best ones. Season 3 was when it started to turn into a real spy drama with a large overarching plot, and 4-5 got quite good. I started watching from the first episode and was pretty happy that it matured into a pretty cool show. All things considered, the finale was pretty much the best that anyone could ask for. Most shows don't even attempt to wrap anything up.   Honestly, ingrown hairs, red bumps, and stubble burns are way less attractive. I think hairless looks great but very few people can pull that off without all the irritation and maintenance.    Honestly, as a guy it doesn't really matter as long as you pick one or the other and stick to it. Stubble is the worst feeling in the world, but grown leg hair is actually quite fine and soft. My girlfriend doesn't shave her legs and it has never weirded me out.      WHO ARE YOU   So in hindsight which is harder? The physical pain of the injury or the pain of withdrawal?   PhDtephen, if it were at a Starbucks.   It's almost as if there should be an entity that negotiates health care prices on behalf of citizens.....   Nice job. Did you take a look yet at the mega-special on avians in the recent issue of Science? http://www.sciencemag.org/content/346/6215/1308   I lived in Franconia for a while about a decade ago and all toilets were like in OPs picture.   I don't understand how this makes the news. North Korea says this literally every single year on January 1st. In fact, I'd be surprised if they didn't say anything.   The problem is: what will they call it? The name has to be easy enough for regular folks to understand that it's an internet browser (ie. many people have no idea what Firefox or Chrome are). It will need to have the word "internet","web", or "browser" in the name.   Anecdotal, but I live in Palo Alto -- where Macs dominate the entire surrounding 10 mile radius -- and the Microsoft Band is sold out.   No, it was because many developers were lazy shits and did an OS check for "Windows 9" hoping they would hit the 9X versions.   As a case example: imatinib was originally developed to treat CML, which is by most interpretations a very rare cancer. Novartis made fucking boatloads of money.   Wouldn't the natural solution be to strip all police units of militarized equipment and outsource it to a new unit of the National Guard? You could even make it such that the police have to pay, with city money, the National Guard every time they need a SWAT/armed unit (you could even charge really high prices). It would slow down the knee jerk "send out the guns" police responses, and make the police really think about whether they have the money to do it.  Secondarily, the "lack of professionalism" in police forces comes right down to lack of accountability. In the military, you are punished and/or dismissed. You are afraid of your superior officers. You are afraid of the enemy. In the police force, you're unionized so it's practically impossible to get fired without it being a huge bureaucratic mess. Citizens are generally unarmed and can't do shit to you. DA offices also have unlimited power to prosecute.   Not to mention the USSR was driven largely in part by "extracted resources" from satellite states and the resulting trade with them. Things like food and raw materials. Russia has none of that, doesn't have a great manufacturing sector, and is frozen out of capital markets from international sanctions.   Wars are expensive. Invading Crimea was the dumbest thing Putin has ever done. It gave the West a reason to put the classic economic stranglehold on them. Putin was also too stupid and lacked the foresight to see US fracking disrupting the oil market, which with the invasion gave the Saudis two reasons to really fuck with the oil prices.   I'd say it would be worth the risk if it drops to ~1% of its previous value. Right now even if it recovers you wouldn't make that much of a return for it to be worth the risk.   This doesn't quite work if one side has disproportionate power.   90% of what? Relative to what? Lifetime? Age?   You don't need unemployment to be 20-30% for the problem to get really bad. The labor participation rate is the lowest in decades, mainly due to the elderly leaving the workforce early. These people will have limited savings and SS will be strained to its limits. Politicians love to talk about SS's solvency, but the fact of the matter is that if you have (1) a consumption-based economy and (2) a huge and aging part of the population unable to afford things, you have no choice but to be aggressive as you can to pour money in. In the future, UBI could basically be a massive expansion of SS.   That... is really dangerous. Your lab can get investigated or penalized for that bullshit.   Im overly paranoid: I take off my gloves every 30 minutes or when I'm switching tasks.   Caps to the right -- they won't snap off in that orientation.   A lot of Chinese eat it at home, so they won't be seen eating it by anyone in the public. In my case, I've only had it around my parents.   There's one for stomach organoids recently in Nature as well.   Seriously though, looking forward to some epic space battles. DS9 had some great scenes with the Defiant fucking shit up.   It's politically convenient for Democrats to do it now, since the map is structured so that they aren't dependent on the Florida vote. Also, that state has become way more diverse in recent decades so the Cuba voting bloc isn't as strong.   He did give the order, though. It's likely that Dar Adal doesn't give a fuck about Saul or Lockhart.   At this rate Schwarzenegger has more political experience than Colbert.   Propping up the currency is useless if you freeze up capital flow and consequently stop the economy. Modern economies rely on credit, so if you suddenly increase to 7.5% you will literally be putting many companies out of business overnight. Not to mention that consumption drives economies, and high interest rates encourage saving.   You need money to fight wars. How long can Russia last?   Don't banks usually raise it a percent or two at a time? How does a 7.5% interest rate increase not collapse the economy, excluding the effect of oil prices?   Having your bargaining chip be your lifeblood is definitely a stupid business plan. The other issue is that with how geopolitical games are playing out with Ukraine, nobody can trust Russia or its government supported companies to negotiate in good faith. At least in China where they have an even higher penetrance of government-sponsored corporations, money rather than politics is the bottom line.  	107

    It's only worth about 0.5. I didn't realise that skullgirls was on sale recently.   Also trading Skullgirls for 2 keys.   Not all of us have bad teeth...

 I'll check it out but when I looked at the AL Finder map there were only 6 people in my area. :(   Wherever that is, I need to go there. This community sucks.   IT'S SO SMALL. There's like 25 of us here and like 85% are exes and then another 10% is friends with one or the other half of the exes, and then the other 5% is apparently invisible.   Not here! That's why I'm asking about other people's communities! Here anyone you think might be butch is gender queer or trans. Which is TOTALLY fine. But butch women seem to be curiously absent! Leading me to wonder if it's just here, or if it's everywhere!   Pardon? I guess the simplest explanation is: Women who dress in a masculine fashion, and don't feel a need to identify as anything except women who dress in a masculine fashion.   It's... Well it's a difficult explanation really. Because it's one of those silly sub-types of labels. BUT. To me it's truly butch, not androgynous. Not trans. Manners, cockiness, knowing how to treat a lady. I fully expect to catch heat for this but it's women who enjoy being women but also dress like men and don't feel the need to be anything BUT a woman who dresses masculine.   That was the worst explanation ever. I'm sorry.   Hey all! I have a question! Do "old school butch" women still exist? Where I live (Atlantic Canada) it seems like "true butch" just got totally obliterated before I was even a baby gay. What are your communities like? Does "old school butch" mean anything to you? All opinions welcome! Show me what you know! :)   What is ftfy?   Court can call it whatever they want, but it's still rape.    Lol. Read a book.   Also I'd like to add that spontaneity is a factor, as well as potential intoxication. Those things, being drunk, high swept up in a moment, they can cloud your judgement. You may realize once you're in a situation that you're not comfortable. You should then be able to say that no, you're not comfortable, and that the situation needs to end.   If we equate what you've said to a different crime perhaps you will see where you went wrong. On a first date, should I inform the person that I'm having tea with that I wouldn't be comfortable being murdered in any way, and that abduction is not something I'm into?    What's unrealistic is to state your sexual boundaries before you've even spent time with a person and gauged sexual chemistry and interest. I shouldn't have to start every first date with "I need to have protected sex." Because clearly I'm not going to have sex with all of those people. No does actually mean no, even though that phrase has been used to much it has almost no meaning now. I should be able to decide at any point during a sexual encounter that what's happening is not okay with me, and have that encounter end or change pace. I shouldn't be forced to complete an act I'm not comfortable with simply because I did not state when I met this person, that I was uncomfortable with something.   I probably wouldn't physically push anyone. Girls like that... they won't necessarily let it stop at that and the next thing you're in jail for "beating her up."   Please do!    I knew there was logic behind my irrational fear of amusement parks.   Everyone should have a Mrs. Ara.   100% not how things work here. In case you're new, here's the rules from the sidebar.   Comment Rules: Readers are to act as though everything is true and treat it as such in the comments. No debunking, disbelief, or criticism (constructive or otherwise). Do not ask for proof. Be respectful to one another. Comments must contribute to the discussion. Report all comments that violate these rules.   Is your dog okay?    I seriously would not let her out of my sight. Nothing has ever happened to my girl but in the city I live in, bad things happen to small dogs A LOT. She goes out on a leash AND we have a fence with a gate that makes a ton of noise. Call me paranoid if you want. Do you have any enemies you can think of, OP? Do your parents?   I'm sorry the comments section is full of a bunch of jokes. Not sure what happened there. What did it feel like, grabbing your hand? Another hand? Smooth? Scales? Etc. Did you guys find somewhere else to sleep? What did your husband have to say?   Holy shit dude. It already happened once? Talk to your parents again, see if you can get someone to watch her during the day. I dog sit, but I'm betting you're too far away for me to help you.   He's a dickhole!! Or an assdick.   It got removed cause it was too short. Maybe add it here instead?  I hope your pup is okay. I know I would go pretty batty if anyone tried to hurt my girl.   I know right? Nothing since the nose bleed except more heartburn but seriously waking up and reading this scared the bejesus out out of me.   Smash it. Burn the pieces. Mix whatever's left and all the ashes with a whole bunch of salt, put it all in a jar, and leave it in a church.   Any thoughts on what she was/is? Your description made me think Fae, dark Fae clearly. Let us know if you've got any information on her!   They're Fae. And you've pissed them off. Leave small bowls of offerings, honey, milk, sweets, etc, near the circle. While you're there tell them who you are, why you're there, and apologize for disturbing them. Tell them you mean them no harm. And keep us updated! Edit: My family always said to ward off Fae you should carry a piece of iron on you and place it above your doorways as well. We use horseshoes above the doors. The Fae can't stand iron. Nor can they stand salt so putting a line of salt at your exterior doorways should keep you safe when you're indoors.   Deathly heartburn and random nausea last night, bloody nose this morning. Well fuck. Am I gonna die?   Fucking furbies. I "accidentally" left mine behind when we moved house a few years ago. Hope whoever moved in had a great time with the little bastard.   That's basically why I don't pick up in bars. Ya never know what you're taking home.   I love bikers. Y'all are so tough but if a toddler hands you a plastic phone you're damn sure gonna answer it. I hope those of you left make it out alright. Keep us updated.   It's gone anyway but disbelief doesn't belong here. Everything is true on Nosleep.  Readers are to act as though everything is true and treat it as such in the comments. No debunking, disbelief, or criticism (constructive or otherwise). Do not ask for proof. Be respectful to one another.   But people are just so much more terrible... and they inspire so much more grief.    You're a fucking lunatic. If your idea of fun is killing an animal, I hope someone gets the same joy out of killing you. Kill people. They are inherently bad and they deserve it. Animals have done nothing wrong.   Welcome, friend. It happens to the best of us.   Honey I think you might have died. Maybe you're in someone else's body, maybe you're not. But you need to do some research. Google the car accident. See if you died. If you look hard enough you should be able to find death certificates. Maybe listen to the guy on the phone, too.   So many babies here. So many.    You're not supposed to break character. That's the whole point of the sub. Everything here is true.   That isn't how things work here.   Maybe just stop killing her... Tell someone when you see her. A doctor or a police officer. Anyone who knows what happened in the past.   Okay so. I'm sorry for what happened but this may be the wrong Sub...   Tell us what happened next! Did you confront your parents? What happened to Margaret?!   Salt!! In all the doorways and in a circle around your bed. Also, lazy arse, start shoveling. I've been shorter than the snow banks for weeks here and haven't put the shovel down yet. If you're still alive, give us an update!   First of all, the part where her blood was green was actually a story she had told from a previous time. Not actually a part of the events of OP's account. Secondly, it takes an extraordinarily large and long-term addiction to the drugs to produce the green blood reaction. For example, mixing heroin and oxycontin for an extended period will sometimes produce it. However, everyone's body chemistry is different and not everyone will have the same reaction. AND you just broke the rules of this sub. No disbelief.   Really?   Thanks. I've started doing that too. Not eating when I know I'll be out all day. Quitting smoking made it so unbearable that I didn't leave my house for 2 weeks and basically just decided to keep smoking so I could walk my dog without incident. I haven't sorted out what triggers it yet, I seem to just be on a 3 day rotation of can't stop/can't go. Maybe I'll give the walk in clinic a shout and see what they can do for me! Thanks!   That would just be magical. No more gallbladder = spanking new case of ibs. Still haven't mastered that whole being far away from a toilet thing yet. I would literally try anything to help. Even some of the questionable Nosleep style remedies.   Both I guess but mostly your sister.  	48
 Wouldn't the same logic say to not give income tax breaks to religious people, because they might spend it on religious things?   Just because you don't want the money doesn't mean other schools don't, or that it shouldn't be offered. Presumably you could just refuse it even if it was offered.  I'm sure a lot of private schools *do* want the money.  And seriously, "Taking state money makes you accountable to the state and all of its standards and curriculum and bureaucracy etc"? As far as I know, schools need to be accredited anyway, regardless of if they take funds. (Although that might be different for different states, not sure about that.)    This is less to help poor kids go to a private school and more about destroying public schools and giving well off people a discount on their private school fees.  Why doesn't this help poor people, though? Nobody's saying you should need to be rich to get the vouchers, are they?   So what about funding only the non-religious aspects of private schools? What's the problem with that?   If they're providing a service the government already provides, and people using them saves the government money, it doesn't seem unreasonable for them to get government funding.  I mean, for my state I've seen numbers that the government would save a whole lot of money just offering vouchers for less than public school costs the government.   When someone's in the vault legitimately, there's a goblin right next to them, though. The lock is presumably for those who get in unofficially.

Don't let people into your vault if you don't want them taking stuff.   *life   If I just want to know a simple fact I expect to be uncontroversial, then yes, I'll look at Wikipedia and treat it as a credible source.

See http://frequentmiler.boardingarea.com/laboratory/    You need exactly one random number per spin (or you can use a single random number to seed a PRNG if you need a few more, but you don't ever really need very many for this sort of game). So, what you do is have a counter that you are incrementing very quickly (on a modern processor, billions of times a second) and then simply use whatever's in the counter when the user spins. It is impossible for the user to predict or control the counter since it's going so much faster than human reaction time.  If you do that, your effective entropy is however many times you can increment in a human's reaction time\*. [This source](https://www.ethicalhacker.net/features/book-reviews/mitnick-the-art-of-intrusion-ch-1-hacking-the-casinos-for-a-million-bucks) puts the time for a skilled person at five milliseconds. Assuming 1 billion possibilities per second, and a human capable of hitting a target within five milliseconds, the number of possibilities is 5 million, or around 22 bits of entropy. There are 311,875,200 possibilities for 5 cards out of 52 in order, so knowing that is certainly enough to determine what the seed is. Even with a slightly lower reaction time, you could still do it. Slot machines may have less bits leakage, though.  \*reaction time isn't really the right word here, you're aiming the first few times just to know what time you pressed it, and the time when you actually press something you may want to press it at a specific time.   From the top comment at [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9797918):  I don't think he did much wrong here. It doesn't appear that he actually broke in to your computers, he just submitted lots of bets. **If you're going to run a casino (whose entire business model is based on exploiting weaknesses of others for profit), don't be surprised if people try to exploit your weaknesses for profit.**  Can't say I disagree.   The statement I took issue with was   Not sure if it uses entropy at all.  in the context of someone using the lack of entropy to beat the program. My statement right before that was:  If you are generating it locally, there might be a limit on how much entropy is available, which would mean you could get a lot of data and then analyse it to get the algorithm.  So the way I used entropy there was including anything that could be analysed, which includes pre-programmed "entropy".  Given that I introduced the word into the discussion, did in fact use the standard definition, and the reply used the same word but using a different definition (according to you), I don't see what's wrong with my pointing out above that their statement makes no sense with the words it used. If they want to clarify, they can do so.    When people speak of introducing "entropy" into a program they pretty much never mean accessing pseudo-randomness that was present in the system in it's initial state. They mean getting hardware-based entropy in real-time.  Well they should specify if they are using a non-standard definition. Preselected entropy has its own problems (in particular it may be leaked), but that doesn't mean it doesn't count as entropy.   (I'm assuming every number is a bit, for simplicity.)  It will still take you N/M completely unpredictable interactions to start getting information you can make sense of.  That is equivalent to saying that your system uses at least N bits of entropy (perhaps minus a small constant). If your system uses less, say Y, then after observing YN bits, I can already start predicting. It might take a handful of more bits just to confirm, but your statement can't be true unless you come pretty close to N bits of entropy.    When he says "unpredictable one from the next" he is probably referring to unpredictability for the end user given the information exposed to them, not completely unpredictable knowing everything there is to know about the system state. You don't need any entropy for the former whereas you certainly need entropy for the latter.  The information exposed to them is exactly however many bits they're willing to pay for. If we assume each play gives you 4 or so bits, then 100 plays gives you 400 and won't cost too much, and if you don't have at least 400 bits of entropy to work with, those 400 bits will probably yield useful info.  If you have *no* entropy, then anyone playing a couple games can already analyse it. See my sibling comment for a bunch of examples of this.    Not aware of any incidents in the company's history of anyone being able to predict the outcome of a game in the wild.

It's not doing any sort of cryptography, it just needs results which are unpredictable one from the next.  Uh, that requires entropy. In fact, if it's completely unpredictable, it's got to have as much entropy as the number of bits used.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy_(information_theory):  **Entropy is a measure of unpredictability of information content.**    Well, it uses a random number generator, and when you press 'spin' it has a x% chance of picking the low reelband and a y% chance of picking the high reelband, where x and y are chosen so that overall the payout is, say, 83% (or whatever).  I pretty much figured that from what you said previously.  There's no way to predict what the random number generator will decide. Some jurisdictions require an externally-approved generator, some even require the random numbers to come from an external server. But there is no way to predict what a slot machine is going to give you without nefarious and probably illegal means.  I've seen too many stories about profits from reverse-engineering RNGs to assume that there isn't a way. If you are generating it locally, there might be a limit on how much entropy is available, which would mean you could get a lot of data and then analyse it to get the algorithm.   No - it's decided after you pay, for each spin (rather than across all spins for one session).  What information goes into this decision? It's generating some random bits *somehow* to decide which reel to use; is there any way to predict that?   Is there any way to tell which one was chosen before betting (or choosing how much to bet)?   /r/programmerhumor   His wanting to mentor Harry only has truth implications for things related to mentoring; there are reasons for him to lie about this, and if the truth is that it's alive but Q doesn't want Harry to know, adding mentoring doesn't seem to change anything.

If the North weren't trying to free the Southern slaves, why would the South secede to stop that from happening?    Saving the Union meant getting the South to stop the sucession; had they done so, there would be no need for war.  The South seceded because they *thought* Lincoln was going to free the slaves, among other reasons. That doesn't make it the main issue in the war if the North was fighting for a different reason.  I guess my main problem is with people who think the North was fighting in order to free the slaves, or that slavery was the sole reason for the South.   Never ever buy anything on a credit card if you aren't sure you'll be able to pay it by the next statement. If you need to borrow money, don't do it with credit cards. There are better ways.  Pay every bill as soon as you get it, and set up autopay for as many as possible.   They left because (among other things) they *thought* Lincoln would free the slaves. Whether that was correct (i.e. would Lincoln have done anything like that had they not seceded) is debatable. If the Emancipation Proclamation had been before the succession, you would be right.   That wasn't what I meant, sorry. I see how it could be misunderstood.  My point is that since only one side was fighting for slaves (or thought they were), the war was not "mainly" about slaves. Nothing about who was right.   How is that not an offer, though? He basically said "if the only way to get you to stop is by letting you have slaves, then I will". If the Southern states' main reason was ensuring they could have slaves, they should have taken him up on that.  And my second point remains. The North fought to prevent the South from seceding, *not* to free the slaves.   Your claim seems to imply that the reason the North fought was to free the slaves. Got any sources for that?   There are two sides to the war; the Northern side's reason for going to war was not to free the slaves.   Then why did the states fight even after they were offered to keep those rights? Or for that matter, why did Lincoln offer that if the main purpose of the war was to free the slaves?   They seceded well before any of those rights were taken away, though.   I didn't say it wasn't a large part. Read my comment more carefully. And I don't fly any flags, that's just irrelevant.   Well if you know some history you'd be one of those people too.   Edit: my claim is that it wasn't completely, or (arguably) mostly, about slavery. IIRC Lincoln was ready to let the south keep their slaves at one point if it would stop the war.   It was definitely part of it, though, just not a large a part as many might think.   \* insert stupid comment here\*   Think of one of your hobbies, one you put a lot of time into; say, at least 5-10 hours a week you spend reading the latest news about it, thinking about it, commenting online about it, etc.  Now, you've been doing that for years.

How long would it take me to learn enough that I know more than you?     but it would be pretty messed up for a company to provide a service and completely misrepresent the costs.  Welcome to the business world.   Could it be that you were paying that to the company, and also paying 2% or so to the issuers? And maybe someone along the way misunderstood and thought the small fee was all there was? Because I really don't think any small business can pay that little based on what I know.   Those are Interchange Plus Pricing, which is on top of the credit card fees to the issuer.

These are viewed as competitive rates.    In the old system you were still subsidizing old/sick people.  Please source this. Why would any insurance do that, which seems to be strictly suboptimal for them, if they weren't being forced?  Why would the law need to force the insurance companies to do that if they were doing it anyway?   Yes, I pay less, but not enough less. I'm paying more because of this law to subsidize old/sick people, when I shouldn't be, and you're trying to pass it off as "standard insurance practice", when it isn't.    and the whole thing hinges on the premise that young people...can and should subsidize the healthcare of baby boomers  From http://abcnews.go.com/Business/top-reasons-young-adults-sign-affordable-care-act/story?id=22690267:  Prior to the ACA, older and/or unhealthy adults could be charged more than five times what young, healthy adults were for health insurance premiums. The ACA limits this "age-rating" ratio to threethat is, older or unhealthy individuals can be charged only up to three times what the young and healthy pay.  So if I'm a fifth as risky as a high-risk person, I still need to pay a third of what they pay, which means I'm overpaying. The ACA outlawed charging based on risk for more than a 1:3 ratio. Yes, that was invented by the ACA.   Except generally the people at higher risk pay more. You should pay the same amount as anyone else with the same expected cost, and those should balance out for the insurance company; but if I'm low risk, why should I pay more because insurance companies aren't allowed to charge more to high-risk people? They can only charge the highest risk people at most 3 times of the lowest risk people, regardless of how large the difference in risk may be.   Sigh ...  I went through it again and copied the text.  In this particular city, you have two options: you can take the local train, which is cheap, or you can take the express train, which is more expensive but which will save you a full hour of travel time. (Suppose your plans aren't time-sensitive, **and that you don't have anything fun to do on the train  you'll just be waiting in your seat throughout the ride, and there isn't really anything to see outside the window.**)    Also unless I skim-read over the top of it, the train scenario didn't give any concrete numbers for exactly how much time it saves, so drawing any conclusion about the consistency of our valuation of time seems suspect.  Pretty sure it specified *exactly* 1 hour.    I would be willing to spend more money on using the do-it-fast machine than on the express train because I can do other things on the slower train (e.g. play video games) whereas if I have a task that must be done on the weekend it is something that would require my attention and prevent multitasking.

Gavin won't be a dev anymore on the main code if he goes ahead with the fork.   Did *not* expect this one to be a bot too.    The reality is of course it is ultimately there will be a vote by miners. The most work chain will always win and the miners will prove they are more powerful than the subreddit, the developers, full node operators, merchants and the exchanges combined. None of the other groups will ever be able to challenge the most work chain, in my view.  It's more complicated than that; even if 95% of miners change, since this is a hard-fork, no exchanges or nodes can be forced onto the new chain. If 95% of miners *don't* change, they can stop the fork assuming it's backwards-compatible with old blocks, but not in reverse.   I agree with you; I just wanted to point out that parent's claim of "90% support one side" can be twisted both ways.

Fast forward to the performance, he actually had the vagina to scream "screw you, I won't do what you tell me."  I feel he totally missed the point of the song.

I'm with you. Loves me some heavies, if you know what I'm sayin'.   Yeah this seems to make the most sense.   Yeah I can totally see that being the issue.   Oh yeah, totally forgot about the heavy version.   I too enjoy the lack of snipers on this map, but thought it was odd all the same. Maybe it has to do with the camping spaces, like on top of or around the satellites.   Something I've always wondered.  EDIT: Pertinent halo related discussion instantly downvoted without reason. Cool.   Who would do such a thing?   Interesting. Thanks for that.   I used to have a copy of that book with the same cover, I can't find it anywhere.    I think we can Allah Gree with that.      I'm here man, what do you want to chat about?   It's the health epidemic that's sweeping the nation. If you and your product cannot be synonymous with healthy active living, it will fail in today's market.   I'm not saying there's anything at all wrong with healthy living, but I can't help but feel it's forced down my throat every day, and this picture is a perfect example of it.  Every time I eat a cheeseburger or have a cigarette I can't help but feel overwhelmingly guilty, it really sucks.  TL;DR Boo hoo poor me.   [We get them around my work all the time](http://i.imgur.com/heUJqvo.jpg)   I'm not sure they have a website, it's really just a butcher on a farm North of the city. They offer just about anything you can think of. They have all sorts of game meat (elk, bison, deer etc), and of course chicken, pig, and beef. A big juicy New York Striploin is about 10 dollars, and personally for me, the best thing I've ever eaten.   I stock up on all my meats there, hamburger, whole chickens, bone-in hams, steaks, bacon, and sausages to name a few. It's worth seeking out and having a look for yourself.  (FYI - you have to call in and pre-order bone-in hams this time of year)     I highly recommend "Balzac Meats". The quality of everything they have is amazing.   I am not familiar with the band, but these pictures are the epitome of bandporn IMO. Good work.   Nice, thanks man!   She likes beans and Guinness now.

"This is nowhere near what you described 6 months ago."  "Oh yeah, well about that, we totally shouldn't have promised 6 months, more like 8. Sooooo sorry."  "As a consumer I should be outright pissed off and demand my money back. But because this is the current state of the world and it's lack of quality assurance, I'm totally ok with it."

 Sounds to me like she is involved with another guy, and is leaving the door open for you in case things don't work out with him.   Do you know that to be the case?   98% is a terrible rating. Next time, try for 99.5 or above. 4 negs in the last month is also bad.  Has he marked the item as shipped? I would wait a few days after that point and then if nothing has shown, i would open a case saying item not received. If the item has not been marked as shipped, I would contact him and ask when the item is shipping out. If you open a case in a timely manner if the item never shows, you will most likely end up with your money back since the buyer has no proof (tracking) that he ever shipped your package.

You split those buses like a virgin on prom night.    WTF were they feeding it, iced tea?   the chances of that being the case are stupendously small in comparison with more mundane explanations such as military aircraft, balloons, etc.  The way in which these and other similarly reported objects move, rule out conventional aircraft / balloons / etc. because of the physics and intelligent control involved with their flight characteristics. Combine that with the objects shape, lack of sound, lack of FAA beacons, altitude, and the general frequency of sightings **across the globe**, and you have a phenomenon that is clearly far from ordinary.  While not particularly in this case, similar objects are said to have been reported to exhibit flight characteristics that are impossible (undiscovered) at our current understanding of physics, let alone our current level of technology. E.G. - acceleration from zero to 1000+ MPH instantaneously, 1000+ MPH to zero instantaneously, executing right angle turns at constant mach speed, performing aerial maneuvers that would kill a human pilot due to G forces, doing all of this using an unconventional propulsion system that is inaudible, and that is only scratching the surface of their stated abilities.    And completely silent as well, correct?   In my own personal opinion, they are not of this world, but thoughts like that will get you castrated around here, m8.   Most people can't wrap their head around that possibility. They either don't *want* to believe or their mind will not let them think outside the box. Then again, perhaps they have just not done the proper research in regards to the thousands of yearly reported sightings and experiences had by people worldwide. Unfortunately, this topic is often suppressed in the mainstream media where most of the populace get their information, so it does take a little digging to find what you are looking for.   After all the recreational research I have done, books I have read on the subject, and the countless stories/sighting reports I have read (from overwhelmingly credible witnesses), to me, at this point, it is the **only** possibility.   Fiji tastes like volcano jizz.   /u/ClemClem510... you're my hero   That's why I'm glad my man Bernie identifies as Independent. Although he is going to have to chase the Democratic nomination to have a shot at winning, which is depressing in its own regard.   That's what got me on the rant in the first place. What a joke that guy is.    What you have is a typical UFO sighting. You won't get any answers here because nobody knows what they are exactly. This is a very common type of sighting in that 3-5+ orbs form triangles and other shapes in the sky and appear to be under intelligent control. The specific movements of the orbs many times eliminate flares as being a possible explanation. They are also almost always located within our own atmosphere, ruling out stars or planets.   How did you end up losing sight of them? Did them blink out or slowly drift out of your vision range? I have come across hundreds or similar sighting reports in the past several years, none of which have ever been adequately explained.   Excellent quality on a couple of the photos, btw.    You are absolutely right. I almost forgot they tried to elect Sarah Palin into a VP position...   Report back! How was the dinner, man?    Same here.

 The outtakes were not pretty.    That's the first one we did in that sort of style but you might like what we did with the MT-09:  https://youtu.be/f1i9Ww27lxU   I'm just shit at kick starting. A mate who grew up on dirt bikes got it going in 7 or 8 tries.    Absolutely. It's easy to ride and pleasant to get about on. You're not getting Yamaha reliability - but on the other hand if you don't mind getting the spanners out now and then to do minor tighten ups and check things over, it'll teach you more about maintaining your own machine than you'll learn on a Yamaha.    I can tell you on our test bike the exhaust shield bolts came undone on day 2. But pop a bit of loctite on and you should be right. It's the classic bike experience.    GET OUT   Yeah he was a surprise - I just wanted somebody to walk down the street playing trombone, I had no idea he could impersonate a motorcycle! Right guy to call!   Damn, great find! Thanks for that. That's a pretty compelling graph.   Haha sorry mate, we got a bit twisted with this.    I left a shot out where I tasted the himalayan pink salt and said 'mmmm, that's good salt.'   We were trying to keep things a touch ambiguous. Personally I can hardly watch it. I'm loving the YouTube comments. Haha!    It depends what you ride for. For me it's the thrill, and a naked makes fast feel a lot faster. I like having to hold on when the pace comes up, it's much more involving than sitting behind a fairing. More reward for less risk.    You don't spend much time on Web forums, do ya?    Looks a lot like the Zero S from some angles.   Look to the superteam of the East. There's your villain.   Last year was magnificent. Total humiliation.    I hate the cavs with my whole shriveled, black little heart.    This might be the year they finally grow up and do what everyone believes they can if they play the ball and forget the refs.   I used it just this week. It's there! Make sure you haven't clicked on a category that's restricting your search. Click on Video in effects and search for letterbox.    I dunno mate, check my history, I'm not a bullshitter.    The one dunk I ever got in a game. It was a D-grade women's game and I was reffing. All alone on a fast break, this lady puts up a layup, and I can see the instant it leaves her hand exactly what's about to happen. It's going to sit pretty right in front of the rim.  I was obsessed with dunking. At 5"11 and white, this was not a healthy obsession. I used to jump off things to make it happen. I could jump straight up and hang on the rim with both hands, but was an inch or two short of being able to throw it down. It just burned me inside, I used to dream about dunking at night.  So when I saw that ball, something snapped inside me. I was already at full sprint, but I changed course to head for the basket instead of the baseline... One, two, launch... I caught the ball with one hand and jammed the fuck out of it, and roared like a mountain lion.  Then I had to blow the whistle and give somebody a sideball as they all looked at me in total shock. And to make things worse, one of their kids on the sideline started crying and saying "NO JORDANS, NO JORDANS."  Doesn't matter; got dunk. I never got another dunk in a game but I can now die happy.   We'll see it in MCN as "LEAKED: could this be the new GSX-R?"   I've been helping out with promo in Australia, so i got to our local premiere. Great film, very funny. I never saw the first one but laughed my arse off at this one.    Fucken yay.   Jesus that guy's voice is just exquisite. It's the perfect instrument for pop.    Aaaaaaaaand no NBA for you Australia.    It's a bastard to get out of that stadium.   Unfortunately then you will have zucchini.    That guy is just ridiculous.    Another tip: I forgot to pay my rego and was pulled over for unregistered driving. Had to pay the rego by the side of the road before I could leave, but I got a 750 buck fine on top of it.   Because it was within 2 weeks of the rego expiry, I was able to write in, say it was a mistake and get let off on a warning.    Not the worst way to spend a lunch hour. Definitely read the instructions, no matter how good you think you are - step 1 is "take the lid off the jar before you do anything else."   You sure you're infertile? I thought I was supposed to be after losing a nut and having chemo, but now I've got a son who disagrees with that assessment.    Took me about 5 years to be able to think clearly and sharply again, it felt like I was thinking through cotton wool. I found modafinil helpful.    I carry the gear I need for the job... If there's no job, the camera in my phone is good enough for snapshots.   Aw.    I like the way it rises like an empress above the Seeeerengetiiiiiii.    You and George Clooney.    Did he boop him on the wang there?    That's a great way to make sure next game the chants go "refs you suck dicks."   And the layups, and the open long twos. He's gonna be shattered.    That tech near the end - does he get that call if he hasn't been a whiny bitch all year? Huge call.    Dirigible.    I wonder what the stats are on gay dudes drawing dicks. Higher or lower rate of knobdoodling than straight guys?    STARTED FROM THE BOTTOM NOW WE... STILL HERE.    Or, YouTube could simply play vertical videos back in vertical orientation.   Actually it pretty much does. And ninja turtles.    I was against the idea of ABS until I tried it in the rain. It's beaut. And there are genuinely bikes out there now that are so fast that I find myself leaning on the ABS on fast roads. That's probably not a good thing, but the technology is astounding. Not to mention Bosch's cornering ABS system which takes it to the next level.   He's also shown he can be a huge douche, don't give your heart away so easily.   I suspect it'll be terrible. I know a company that's working on it - soundracer.com - and those guys have a fun thing that plugs into your car cigarette lighter. It reads the revs on your engine and then transmits the sound of a huge V8 to your car stereo so it feels like you're driving a monster truck.   But it relies on revs - to do this for an electric vehicle, you'd need to simulate the presence of gear changes. It would ruin the effect.   I've ridden plenty of loud bikes, but I split every day on a bike that's as quiet as a mouse. I regularly sit and wait behind guys who plod along blipping their throttle waiting for assistance from car drivers to get through. The best thing you can do to make your bike better for splitting is to fit fold-in mirrors.   I like the sound of a bangwagon. Amish porn?    Yep. I'd put a giant-arsed family size pizza tray sprocket on the back and make it even more berserk if I owned it. I've got no business going more than 300kmh.    I've seen what they're working on for the next model and it will be right up your alley.    This is 100% down to battery cost. And there's some serious volume manufacturing staying to happen soon that is expected to bring the prove of batteries down by 75% - that's the target, at least.    I didn't get the prism til later. It's a GP10 Bluetooth backpack on the GoPro 3+ that receives the sound and sticks it on the GoPro vision.    Yeah I was traveling so I bought a lid in California, and I wanted something ADV style. But it wasn't too bad, even at speed!    The Gigafactory is all about cost reduction. But every battery company on the planet reckons they've got something with twice the energy density on the bench due to better structures or chemistry. Obama threw 6 billion dollars at the industry a few years back and there's just a constant stream of new ideas coming through. I have a lot of faith that major breakthroughs will change the game in the next 5-10 years. I'd love to see a graph of battery improvement since the 1990s, ni-cad through to Li-po and beyond, I suspect you'd be surprised.    Because people are still stressing about range on these things and going from direct drive to putting a gearbox in is at least a 10% drop in mechanical efficiency.    I have a strong recollection of one of the FAST BIKES guys pictured in a magazine pulling a huge stoppie on a GSXR K5, I think it was, without his fingers on the brake lever. This shot reminded me of that photo, and now I can't find the god damn picture.   Aprilia runs hot as a motherfucker. You'll need tin foil underpants if you "cruise" on it so you can get a nice crispy skin on your baked spuds. Good bike for going flat out on, but grumpy around town. My pick is the S1000RR, the 2015 model optioned up with the active suspension and cruise control. That's one hell of a bike. Super easy to putt about on, plus goes like stink on a full throttle, and having ridden a good few superbikes I'd say it's also been the comfiest for me.   Yep, brought a 20S with me to America and bought a helmet when I got there. Had the little GP10 GoPro backpack on. Sadly I fucked up the angle of the chest camera and I had precious little time to film, so that stuff was all but unuseable. The 20S does a pretty remarkable job considering I got up to about 130-140mph on some of those little squirts.   Here's the thing - massive, monstrous levels of performance are just not an issue. Range, battery density, fast charging standards and battery price are - and those will come down fast as the Gigafactory and other mass battery manufacturing operations kick into gear. All the things like emissions and noise regulations, and all the complicated reasons why petrol engines need more and more complex engineering to keep improving them - electrics don't have to worry about any of that stuff.    He's right - full throttle at a standstill doesn't take off like a rocket. It's an immensely powerful and torquey motor locked in a very high gear. I suspect most gas superbikes would beat it to 40mph. But hit the gas at 60mph, like I was on the Skyline road, and there's *nothing* I've ridden that comes close. It's absolutely insane. And if I owned one I'd downgear it as far as is practical, because I ain't gonna be doing 218mph any time soon and I'd want that monster performance as accessible as possible.   US$38k... Yeah. Still early adopter territory.   I don't think I'd have worked it out if he didn't put the tail piece next to it.   I had a Boss Hoss in my session on a track day once. Sat back and watched him lug that lardy barge around for a lap. It was a huge chore in the corners but he was clearly having a giggle smoking it up on the exits and the straights.   https://imgflip.com/i/kd4x1   https://imgflip.com/i/kd4x1   Yeah, but you know how that stuff works. People who post that sort of shit are usually the ones who most need that message, that's why it resonates enough for them to want to post it. John Lennon's a great example - his lyrics were 'peace, love, mung beans' but he physically and mentally abused his wife.   I'm a father. I toss my son in the air heaps coz he loves it. Ok he's indifferent but I love it. Screw you guys.    No, but c'mon in buddy. Your bike is now an orphan again.    Fucking pricks. Just about every story or photo I post gets stolen and rehosted somewhere too. Even worse to see it submitted on reddit.    Melbourne is one of the best places in Australia to ride a motorcycle. Nice wide lanes you can split down, and you can park your bike on most footpaths for awesome access to just about anything. So if you're at all interested in bikes, this is a beaut place to ride them. Sure as fuck shits on public transport.    It's training. Easier if you do it earlier, but I believe if there's nothing physiologically wrong with you, you can learn.    *timbre   That's how basic traction control works when it has different levels you can select. Slide control is a bit more complex as I understand it.   The latest and greatest bikes are starting to run inertial control units that can get very accurate readings of things like your lean angle, the pitch of the bike, g-loads and yaw. I believe slide control uses the lean angle and yaw readings to allow the bike to get a certain amount of sideways happening before it gently intervenes.   I've only had one quick track session on it, and I was focusing on the active suspension out there, so I didn't play with that setting. But the electronics are just getting more and more amazing.    The new S1000RR has slide control.    He sure does seem to ride like a man who hasn't figured out how hard the ground can be yet. Magic.    He's got that humble dunk attitude though. I wanna see him break out a bit of flash.    I was looking for Gerald Green.    DONGGGG   Mind you the really cutting edge stuff from silicon valley rarely seems to work on android first.    For the continuity stuff, you can get pushbullet for android. Works great.    ...and those fucken mushrooms. Dear god they are just ridiculously good.    Dunno what side of town you're on but there's a taiwanese restaurant opposite Malvern station that sells it as 'XXL chicken' as well.    SOUND BATHS! SIGN ME UP!    Best in-game dunker in the league. OH YEAH I SAID IT   We'll know in a day or two!    I'd say don't bother with a camera until you can afford one that is stabilized. The vision is useless, and the cameras weigh the quads down, reducing maneuverability and flight time.    Melbourne, Australia. It's about to become legal here in a limited sense but has been tolerated add long as I remember. I split every chance I get and will change lanes if I can't get through. I'll fold in my mirrors if things get tight. I make sure I don't hold car drivers up, and they don't hold me up, that's my rule.    Paywalled.    Big announcement from DJI tomorrow...   Brave is one word for it.    You're probably right. But you never know.    How you feeling about this at this point?    Extraordinary work, mate. Get yourself a license and go commercial with it.    Yes, because the usual crowd of bron chasers would flock to follow him. For all his many vaunted skills, team stacking may be his most powerful ability.    Correction: as I understand it, the terms of the TPP are to be kept secret for FOUR YEARS AFTER IT IS SIGNED.    Can you do us a favor and post a dyno chart?    Just tell 'em where the stops are and maybe any hits you want them to catch. Work with them in rehearsal or send them a recording of a groove if you like.    In all seriousness, this is why I recommend if you're gonna go and ride hard, you should learn how to wheelie and stoppie. When a wheel comes up you should know how to handle it, and the best way to practice that is in a safe place at lower speeds.    I generally get along well with Canadians - same as kiwis and scots. I think all us little brother countries have a similar attitude.    I don't see a lot of hate for AD, Curry or Durant. The guys that cop it do for a reason.    Get a bit of mongrel up ya Wiggins! Don't gimme that fluffy weak crap!      He broke back in again though.   Who's cuddling up and enjoying movies? I look at that guy and experience about double the 'holy shit' factor I get from Arnie - it's an awe inspiring display of insanely hard work and discipline combined with jackpot genetics and the best nad shrinking drugs money can buy. Arnie's physique is stunning but believable. This guy is so far beyond that, it looks almost like another species.    I believe that's how it works. So players can be totally confident they won't be tested again after their 4th check. Seems ridiculous to me but I think it's part of the deal with the players' union.   The NBA needs to publish the dates of when each player gets his 4th and final 'random' drug test for the year.   Bummer eh. I suppose it must be a touch demoralising being a stand-in and knowing you'll be sitting behind one of the greatest in the game as soon as he's healthy again.   What the heck happened to PJ3? He looked like durant-lite for stretches when KD was out. Did I miss a memo somewhere?   Yep I thought I was a goner. Passenger had no idea til she saw the video... That was the last time she got on a bike.   Maaaaate who needs brakes? They just make you go slow.    I was there too. Stonking motorbike. That suspension... Wow.    This is me on the bike. Looking back at it still scares the shit outta me. https://youtu.be/9TxEw1LunfM  	115
 man you are gonna flip your shit when you start making $30/hr   no problem... you can use these too:  Game 2 [Game Start](http://www.twitch.tv/riotgames/b/489179573?t=2h32m30s)  Game 3 [Game Start](http://www.twitch.tv/riotgames/b/489179573?t=3h14m30s)   **XD.GG vs Gambit**  Game 2 [Picks   Bans](http://www.twitch.tv/riotgames/b/489179573?t=2h26m30s)  Game 3 [Picks   Bans](http://www.twitch.tv/riotgames/b/489179573?t=3h12m30s)   3 you the best   whats up with the formatting for the EG games?    man...Bang threw that game so hard   iirc at the time EG was looking into signing a team but didnt because they were unwilling to drop their dota squad...and since Scoots was 2 or 3rd in charge of EG at the time he is a credible source. I think it was in his real talk with JP..have to see if i can find a time stamp   Didn't sir scoots(formerly of EG) confirm this during an interview?   I always respond with "I love me too"   see title   if you are in your 20s/30s I've found okcupid to be the best in terms of getting actual response   how is this game played if I'm ambidextrous?   said male may be interested in you and using the "you're so quiet" line as a conversation starter...i know i'm guilty of this   very true. but the lack of warding/overextending exists outside just IG/WE is endemic of the entire chinese scene. If tsm wards and plays "safe" they should shut down the OMG roam and may have chances to make their own picks   The only game I can see going any other way is the OMG vs TSM match. having watched most the LPL I'm very concerned about OMG's laning phase and their tendency to over extend. We saw in all-stars that the US can punish these chinese tendencies in lane and TSM just might have the team fight coordination in the late game to finish OMG off.   these times are way outside NA prime time. NA prime time is 7 EDT to 10 EDT. This starts at 10pm and goes to 2AM EDT most nights so even us East Coast US people are screwed...oh and we dont even have a good server.   What Doa was saying is that the items bought with their gold leagues create huge power spikes for their respective champions.    assuming you dont have subscription to OGN it looks like the VODs are slowly being uploaded to LolChampSeries on youtube.      I feel like a lot of girls i know pull this look off regularly   Lg-IM already has 2 LOL teams, MVP has arguably the best LOL team MVP Ozone...thus makes sense.   ps3 plz   Didn't Ryan slit his throat? I swear I remember that being the end of an episode    i think ryan is missing some kills..namely the son of the mayor...name escapes me now :(   for me i hate small talk because it prevents me from getting to know the "real" person i'm talking to. Plus talking just for the sake of talking is exhausting   I know I personally unsubscribed BC when I bought gold pass I was promised 4-5 major sc2 LANs(Orlando, Anaheim, Raleigh, cbus, providence?) a year...and now MLG has not only cancelled sc2 coverage..but they stopped coming to my area(Raleigh)   whats the best way to support this effort? watching the videos? liking the videos?    as a sc2 player, neither Day9 nor HD(who isnt even involved in the scene anymore) are considered analytical casters. Day9 especially has been exposed over the past year for being a self hyped glorified play by play guy.   dont  look at others peoples numbers, the only person you are competing with is yourself. Push yourself while knowing your limits, nail form over big numbers, and most importantly have fun   who is the OP of this post...how can you not love chobra?!   which is why EG have thresh/twitch/xin because it allows for great disengage/kiting   while correct. for about the last 10 minutes eg was grouped allowing NIP to respond. Also, Wicked was not split pushing at all. if they had employed a 3-1-1 split push they could have take towers much easier.   two teleports...refuse to split push...it makes no sense   i feel like they aren't pushing enough...when did their first tower go down? it seems like its too late. IN ogn when this is run(usually cait/ez) its based off a really fast tower push based on nunu/nasus   its a solid comp..double ad has been dominating in korea...CLG just refuses to use the fast push that it requires to work.   in this case indicating skyrim will be next   That's the thing that annoys me most...at least give us an update on twitter or SOMETHING.    Is the wcs europe stream down for anyone else. I'm on android using twitch app and the English stream has been offline for about 45 mins now. I can still see games via Russian and Spanish streams...but obviously they aren't the same   As someone who does crossfit and is huge into the Esports community I think Esports has a higher chance..mostly because individual components of Crossfit are already in the olympics. Also, the olympics kinda works off a predefined format where the variation the crossfit games provides cant  be  replicated. Also, League of Legends is getting huge with their LCS players being officially recognized as athletes by US govt for passport purposes.    i'm pretty sure that to make up for this, c9 went void staff instead of Frozen Heart   had ryze hitting his power spike with spirit visage, tear, roa(aka the Dade Ryze build) as TF was falling off at the same time   stephano was imba when he was on mill..kinda fell off after joining eg...and jaedong only looks get when playing vs zerg or foreigners   your joke wont counter the eg curse :(   this happens to me and i have cox...i think its a riot issue. Hampton VA      i can only assume he is talking about Catz getting invited to hsc and not going...but the reason he didnt go is he didn't want to pay for flight...so not sure i understand his point   Norfolk is the best. if your work takes you to the other side of the water I would suggest http://www.crossfithamptonroads.com/     Last night when I went to bed it was easily number 1 on here. I'm guessing a lot of people changed their minds after reading monte   excellent execution of the feed the khaxiz strat. superior team fight potential. C9 won at champ select.   both buffs getting stolen is rare for sure. but dig did nothing with those two buffs. for example if the had used all 4 buffs to stop towers from going down and/or to push bot lane tower they would have had a lead. but c9 played a smarter(korean) style   and this can all be fixed by going bt into blue ezreal build   I'll try my best but this question as a whole is better answered by a guy like monte cristo. Lets start as the buffs are getting stolen. c9 has 2 options, contest with multiple players(putting each lane at a disadvantage) or letting them take them. Nasus then goes immediately to the 2v1 lane bc jungle nasus takes spirit fire first allowing easier wave clear for an even faster tower. As soon as C9 takes first tower the have map control and can dictate the pace of the game. C9 switches their duo back to bot to prevent dig from taking a fast tower and to keep pressure on dragon.  C9 keeps pressure on lane and slowly push all lanes. The slight lull in action we saw during mid game is bc jayce becomes a monster in team fights around the 18 min mark or whenever muramana is complete.  support takes oracles earlier and often to keep map control and allow for more psuhing. this is standard korean play   Trick question right? I always ate all my candy on Halloween   especially since he a producer of all their english streams.   The korean guy is Chobra. he is the english/korean translator for ogn. The guy on the right is Montecristo, he is the artosis of LOL. He is also a former WC3 player and a SC2 player   and resistance series, and infamous series, and little big planet    i'm on 480 fine...i'm watching the osl streams though   I forgot I was subscribed to ogn stream..thought vods were available for everyone   May I suggest twitch.TV streams which are free?   This is a joke IMO. Purposefully having the bracket so that no one race can appear dominant. Such a shame.    I promise I won't tell the party    next week do we find out that uncle oris is actually tugabutt's father(horribly disfigured from being crushed by an ogre). Then he goes on to kill ~~Emperor Palpatine~~ dalamar?   i didn't catch a lot of the cast but I think the one thing i would say is to practice intro to the game starting/outro to commercial break. I know its really tough to pull off but it is awesome when done right.   him and montecristo are AMAZING for the OGN LOL stream. They have such great synergy. Haven't watched their SC2 casts but it shouldnt be bad   Have they fixed the horrible memory leaks in it yet? Last time I tried it, it was unusable    The same thing happens if you use Google chrome in a nonfull screen window   Sorry. I thought you were correcting the English of first post BC you were pro bring MC  in to cast   His sentence is correct assuming the emphasis is on the importance/quality of the game being played(aka a proper game)   but getting people fat means they need to be fat means they can get fat again..   that business model   have you been to sc2ratings.com  ?   As a diamond NA I can confirm most of us want to sit back and defend till 200/200   when i get to stream it usually always has 10k viewers   qxc went full mech..you never go full mech   you spoke to early  his internet died.   If you can afford it, subscribing for the VODs is definitely worth it if you watching league. The qualiber of play will shatter your mind. If you can't afford it I suggest checking out the GPL English YouTube channel. You see crazy stuff in Asia(support veigar)   that looked like the same area the have lcs matches today   TCC: at least its not Thomas Nelson ;)   James Madison sucks. go ODU! :D pretty cool getting to meet MMA  	79
 I'm a psychologist in Vancouver Canada with an interest in NEETs and Hikikomori. I've seen many people in my practice who show all the standard features of this problem, and psychologists around the world seem to be reporting the same thing. So there may be some specific cultural features (in Japan for hikikomori; perhaps in the UK where the NEET term is most often used), but there are probably common features as well.   At the moment I'd be interested in input on a particular question. Given that there is probably no single factor that caused the issue in most cases, what are some of the important factors that you believe contribute to the problem? Extra points if you're speaking about personal experience, but don't say anything that will reveal your identity.    Maybe only one cause or factor comes to mind.  If so, what is it? If more than one occur to you, what are they?   Thank you for any help you can give.   I'm a psychologist in Vancouver Canada with an interest in this area. I believe that much of the discussion in the academic literature on the hikikomori issue is misguided - it focuses on the question of why this problem is specific to Japan, and what the unique features of Japanese society are that might contribute to it.  But it isn't unique to Japan. I've seen many people in my practice who show all the standard features of this problem, and psychologists throughout the West seem to report the same thing. It may - or may not - be more common in Japan, but it certainly isn't unique to it.  At the moment I'd be interested in input on a particular question. Given that there is probably no single factor that caused the issue in most cases, what are some of the important factors in your own life? I'm not asking anyone to list ALL of them. Maybe only one comes to mind.  If so, what is it? What are they?   Thank you for any help you can give.   Yes, both homelessness and suicide are more prevalent in men, though problems like depression seem more common in women - and hikikomori seem often depressed or, at minimum, socially very anxious (which has a more even gender ratio). There are suspicions that people edging toward the Asperger's (high functioning autism) spectrum may be more likely to become hikikomori, and all ranges of autism are more common in males. But I suspect this is more a matter of fad-ism - Asperger's is presently in the public consciousness and as a result is likely being grossly overdiagnosed. A person we might formally have called socially phobic or avoidant is today likely be labelled Asperger's - and I think mislabelled for the most part.   This may well be true in Japan. But the gender imbalance that I'm thinking of is in Canada, where there doesn't seem to be an expectation that women stay home at all. In fact, few clinicians seem to have met women with this issue.  As a side note, the phenomenon also seems to be almost uniquely a heterosexual thing. None of the clinicians I've spoken to have seen a gay man with this issue. This may be a numbers problem - there are more straight than gay men - but the number of cases I'm talking about suggest otherwise.    I like your comments particularly within the spoiler section. Without giving away any spoilers myself, I would echo the sentiment that what seems like a painful but necessary step for many people who are stuck in their lives is to relinquish the fantasy that they have been engaging in - a fantasy that feels like it sustains them but actually keeps them stuck - and deal with humdrum reality instead. By giving up on my dream of being a wealthy rock star and getting an average job, etc, I may feel like I'm losing out but I'm actually trading an ultimately unfulfilling fantasy for a satisfactory reality.   I like that phrase - "smear flowers onto the issue."   I wonder about the "life is horrible" thought. It surely is in many places - Gaza, Iraq, Sudan. Most of Sato's life, though, isn't really all that bad. He has a home, he has food, and yes, it isn't given to him and he needs to find a way to get it. His mind is in a very painful place, but he actually has the resources to get out of that place, as he discovers when he begins to use them.  Sato's internal world is one in which people are constantly laughing at him and criticizing him. But in fact most of this is imagined. Some people do criticize in the series, but not nearly as much as he trashes himself. In fact, in the street scenes he is generally as anonymous and unnoticed as he would like to be.  I agree completely that the solution is often to give up on the idea of the magical fairy (Misaki, a girlfriend, a psychologist) to come and save us, and instead to take the reins of our life and do it ourselves.   I may get myself into trouble with this reply, but I think one of the problems is often society's emphasis on ultra-achievement. For you to become good enough you have to be a high-powered lawyer, a heart surgeon, an internet billionaire, etc - roles that a) most people will not achieve, b) would not suit most people, and c) many people feel skeptical about anyway ("I get to drive a Ferrari but I got there by destroying the environment, climbing ruthlessly over others, or otherwise violating my ideals").  Sato and Yamazaki fantasize about the big score - becoming heads of a mammoth game development company. Whether they do or not (no spoilers there), what seems to help many people is relinquishing wild dreams and alighting on planet Earth, getting a job not because it is a great passion or "fulfills my soul" but because it pays rent and may serve as a stepping stone to the next bit of my development.   In Canada everyone has had the experience of being stuck in snow and feeling the temptation to tromp on the gas pedal and spin the wheels 0 but when you do that you don't go fast, you just lose traction. To get out of the hole, you need to go very slowly and gently. That seems to be how people get out of the hikikomori life as well.    Many would agree with you. Personally, I am relatively unimpressed by my field's fascination with diagnosis. We take a difficulty with living (a tendency to fall into one of life's many traps, let's say) and call it something it actually isn't: a disease. So we take a person facing a challenge and tell them "You still have that challenge, plus now you have a mental illness" and we think we're helping.   Therapy involves overcoming the sense that one is a victim of a disorder and developing a sense of agency and control in one's life. So my bias is not to call it a diagnosable disorder and just deal with the issue. But I am often a voice in the wilderness on that point.   I recently conducted an unscientific minisurvey amongst psychologist colleagues asking about gender ratio of this type of issue, without signalling my own suspicions.  Without exception, respondents identified this as a majority-male issue. Most stated that they had not seen a woman in this situation, though some had - and I agree that they are likely out there. There are no good epidemiological studies, but I believe the life is more of a draw (trap?) for males in general.   Could I add this remark to the blog post (or a followup) itself? You don't seem to be saying anything that would identify you, and I would not use your handle.  	10

I saw an almost identical one in NYC yesterday! http://imgur.com/H9EegZD   Close up http://imgur.com/H9EegZD   I was eating the same cut of steaks when it popped up while I was surfing youtube. I had mine with a mushroom gravy and baked potatoes.      Bingo! Which is why having his wife give him one is so funny.   I was going to post the "Castle Truck" video as well but remember these guys are in Australia or New Zealand so they have different height rules than we do. I've also thought of doing this with a row of steel framed windows that can be lowered/raised into place for travel. Something like this but movable https://www.pinterest.com/pin/388646642820603133/   This looks like a German version of Beef Braciole and you don't have to use the pickles but try some with just to try them out.         I know, right? I tried;( but I think if anyone would have gotten it right away it never would have been aired. Conan was not live then, am I correct?

The ONLY G Train Stop and Wait Here to Board Sign is posted 5 feet in front of the stairs, having never taken the G Train before I walked up those stairs and then down the platform past those 2 people in the picture. I was hoping to get in the first car to look out the window as the train went along the elevated tracks but to my surprise the train stopped WAY down the platform and the doors closed before I could run back down the platform so I had to wait for another train. The same thing happened to 2 guys when the next train showed up but I blocked the door so they could run down and get in.   Correct, but the sign is posted five feet BEHIND the stairs leading up to the platform. I walked up those stairs and then down the platform to wait for the train, who knew the G Train has so few cars having never taken it before?   I thought that would go a different way ;)   No, someone just took the G Train for the first time.               Your right, I don't know what I was thinking. Thanks for not being mean about it.      Boomtown Rats video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yteMugRAc0 and here's the story https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeQGxS6nLlw            I'm an idiot sometimes, I meant /r/TinyHouses    Beautiful, you should post this in /r/CozyPlaces       Story http://www.topgear.com/uk/car-news/lamborghini-huracan-crash-video-2015-01-19   You are correct http://www.topgear.com/uk/car-news/lamborghini-huracan-crash-video-2015-01-19   Nope, totaled http://www.topgear.com/uk/car-news/lamborghini-huracan-crash-video-2015-01-19    Whoever posted it to youtube got it wrong. They both survived! http://www.topgear.com/uk/car-news/lamborghini-huracan-crash-video-2015-01-19   They proved he lied about knowing the PEOPLE involved but because he didn't provide his text messages and emails they can't prove he lied 100%. Shame, really. I think if he just said I like the footballs I use to be a little under inflated and an equipment guy did it so his teams quarterback would be just that more comfortable in the game, everyone would have forgiven him and moved on. Has nobody learned nothing from Watergate? The coverup is always worse than the original crime.   I think they have raised their prices at least 5 times since then.        	197
 Oooh. Yeaaah. (Rocket voice)     	2
 I signed up to Voat. This is my most valued subreddit. I hope the conspiracy sub is as active and informative as Reddit. Anybody else making the switch? Or staying, or both?   I must admit I did look for the video on liveleak.com         	4
 He was probably teasing his civil war involvement. which is now official.    That will change with direct x 12 though. http://wccftech.com/geforce-radeon-gpus-utilizing-mantle-directx-12-level-api-combine-video-memory/   During the party scene Wilson mentions a missing persons case to cap. Anyone know what he was on about?    And this was mostly doing side missions to level up. The side missions are just as entertaining as the main story and a lot of the side missions link up with the main story line. Now I'm level 10 and I'm about to resume the main story line. This game is amazing. Its gonna keep me busy for months!         i watched it in 2 days.    I actually agree with them. I thought the VFX this season were really good.    Works for me here in NZ.    yea and I can get on the store just fine.    eh steam isn't down.          Get the 4gb model. Now a days games are using more vram than 2gb.          So let me see if I understand this correctly. Becuase of the alternate timeline and what not that the flash going missing happens a lot earlier than 2024? I'm guessing the black whole was the crisis also?    970 here. Played for 4 hours straight no problems.       You can run the witcher 3 just not on ultra or high settings.          I'm getting it on PC.    The wait is so painful especially when people on twitch are already playing it.    No begging.    I have this one to! its awesome.       here's the original interview if anyone's interested its around 3:10 when ruffalo appears. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0grQvejhFtU   its regional pricing. Everything is devalued over in the ukraine no idea why.    fyi this infographic is a bit out of date. Doctor Strange is out in November not July.    fyi I think this infographic is a bit out of date. Doctor Strange is coming out in November not July.    they moved it forward back in October when they announced phase 3. James Gunn announced the new date.       They will make it. Just not now. Probably in phase 4.             Kayran from the witcher 2. such an awesome and challenging fight it was.       proably high settings at 1080p.    it will run it fine. Its just bullshit marketing. Nvidia trying to sell their 900 series cards.       I think present day Barry is gonna get stuck in the future and the whole flash vanishes in crisis will happen earlier than 2024 because of wells speeding things up.   Starling city is under attack and Barry be like. Nah I need to have a chat with my buddy wells.       Is Stephen Amell done with arrow? The way it ended it would seem like it. Or are they just sending Oliver away so that Amell can film TMNT2 and then return when hes done?      So Oliver appeared as the arrow on the new episode of the flash.He's seen wearing league gear. Anyone got an explanation to this and where it fits into the timeline?      Yea I know deadline and various other sites are saying its gotten a 13 episode renewal so I was curious and checked the official facebook and twitter pages of POI and I see they haven't announced on ether of those services that the show has been renewed yet. Is it possible their still deciding on the whole 13 episode thing? since deadline was the only one mentioning it maybe they jumped the gun a bit to soon and had an unreliable source? you'd think like other shows they would want their fans to know they have been renewed.    there is still one episode left.    Did that reference confirm GL is gonna appear eventually in the Flarrowverse?   Netflix Hulu Amazon (Prime) TNT Starz ABC  Any others you guys think would suit POI?    I could see amazon picking it up. they seem to have a good relationship with WB with amazon prime and all.    I find it interesting how Brett Dalton (Ward) seems to be back in the main cast.    We have two episodes tonight so we could find out then.       How can this Sub evolve if its not allowed to change?   and in one of the marvel one shots they reference blonsky and in agents of shield the abomination gets name droped.          Say for instance I get off my horse and go exploring for a bit come back after a while. Can my horse be attacked by other creatures and even die?   The Witcher 3 obviously.    I love it. very different from the american trailer.       interesting. mine shows 3.92gb http://imgur.com/2oFz5KI   Doesn't happen to me. weird. I got it on steam.    the best part lol "do NOT contact me with unsolicited services or offers"   OMG THIS. My mum does this all he time and she doesn't undestand why I get pissed off. its so damn annoying. Ill be like shut the door please after shes talks to me and shell just walk away. lol.    Red Skull anyone?   why do all of his movies suck so bad?      Action movies. I have no shame. I liked transformers 4 lol.       You have to remember they are marketing to a completely different audience in Japan. what seems like a spoiler or ruined moment to us probably doesn't to them. Its a very different and tough audience to market to.       Anyone else get the feeling their up to something? Especially Agent Weaver I get an evil vibe from her when ever she gets involved in discussions and mission plannings its like shes hiding something and shes got her own motives for doing things.    LOL thats bullshit.    Damn and no word on Fox shopping the show around to netflix or hulu :(   The blacklist already got renewed for season 3.    Noooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!   Not at all. Chris Evans was the human torch and Captain America. Why can't Hardy be The Punisher and a DC character?       How do you think season 9 will open and where do you think everyone will end up?  I think Leonard and Penny will get married  Raj will continue dating Emily despite being weirded out by her  Howard and Bernadette will ether kick Stuart out within the first few episodes or something will happen to Stuart that forces them to let him stay with them.   Not to sure about Sheldon. He might try and get Amy back but the way they ended the episode it seems pretty clear the relationship is over at least for now. Really looking forward to see how the writers handle this.     wooo 3 hour podcast hype.       lets say he is Spider-Man and the whole "casting a younger actor" was just a ruse, do you think he'd be a good choice?.    Finally he gets in on the action and he now knows whats really been bothering Felicity! This was long overdue she should of told him about the league like 3 or 4 episodes ago.    I don't care what people say Im watching them in the order their aired.    As soon I saw how Oliver reacted when he heard that maseo gave ra's the bioweapon I knew he wasn't brainwashed.    why the heck would I skip an episode of the flash? gtfo.    Not gonna happen.    No one is hating on it. its just age of ultron didn't live up to the hype for a lot of us. its still a good movie but a lot of us feel underwhelmed by it.    Everyone has their own opinion. But I liked the movie alot. I personally think Norton is a better Bruce than Ruffalo. You should still watch it, it has a lot of great moments.       Why did you get a 5930k instead of a 4790k? you could saved money and got a better gpu.    Mean while Civil War will actually be the big kahuna that we're all waiting for and marvel decided that age of ultron along with ant-man were just a bridge to fill the gap while we wait. It was almost like a filler episode of a tv show setting up and teasing whats to come and didn't really move the plot forward aside from meeting some new characters. Maybe this was intentional or I just picked up on it due to Whedons background work on TV? It just felt like an episode of a tv show that plays before the finale you know what I mean?      I like the story to. Multplayer not so much. Mainly because I just don't have the time to invest in it.    I think the very concept of supergirl sounds stupid and just doesn't fit in the arrow and flash universe imo.    This is old news.    War machine is absent quite a bit in phase 2 we see him a bit in Iron Man 3 then all of a sudden he is a member of the new avengers? I guess we're to assume that a lot of stuff happened off screen between him and cap but id sort of like an explanation of what happened I mean sure he helped out in Ultron but does that make him worthy to be a member of the avengers? I guess maybe stark recommended him to cap as his replacement?      well he is a new avenger. so not surprising. would be kinda weird not to see him.         benchmarks or I don't believe you.          Well I saw someone mention it over on r/pcmasterrace that their was someone or a group of people working to bring the campaign to halo online.       Also looks like its gone up a couple of percent, before it was at 73% and I was worried it might drop below 70% hopefully it can work its way back up to at least 80%.   http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/avengers_age_of_ultron/      What a movie indeed. so glad I finally I saw it. Colin Firth was a bad ass. Action scenes were really well done to. So happy to hear its getting a sequel it really is a sleeper hit. More people need to see this one.    Any thoughts as to why hes teaming up with Barry? if hes supposedly forgotten everything about Oliver it doesn't make sense unless Barry manages to get through to Oliver some how but Oliver keeps pretending hes brain washed when he really isn't just to buy time and figure out a plan.    yea its fair. i liked the first movie and loved guardians and cap 2. I found the first half of ultron a bit boring and tedious to get through.I didn't start appreciating the twins till the second half of the film. It definitely shows that Whedon is running out of ideas and its probably a good thing hes not doing infinity war. id say its fair. Ill be a bit worried if it keeps dropping though.    its sad that you have to point this out. people are so afraid to speak their opinion.    it was avengers assemble in most countries outside of the U.S.    Heres some of my ideas  Have an original avenger die. e.g stark or cap  Spider-Man swings in making his first appearance in an avengers movie.   Have the avengers actually do some serious damage to thanos, thanos withdraws but we see a credit scene with him and his real army of villains and what ever aliens he might have at his disposal, ready to return in part 2.   The guardians arrive to save the day.   Got any other cool ideas?      Wow....          people hate on 2 and 3 but I like both I thought 4 was trash.    Since steam has pretty much gone to shit. Gog galaxy will be the next big thing, right?      power supply could be on its way out, maybe its not delivering enough power. it happens.    Not everyone wants to build their own.    you can https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KubRDApPHc   You know their gonna use that in their arguments now.    its a new zealand based store. its fully legit.    Or do I need to get an actual 3d monitor?            no.    no. buying online is much more convenient as long as you get it from a good store like new egg or amazon.    and yet OP will be at the star wars episode 7 opening night.    i agree with this but what we can agree on is that the joker looks terrible. But his performance might be awesome. And that's what matters.      fake.               RDJ has two more movies on his contract. Civil War and Infinity War Part 1. He will probably die in Infinity War.       I like it. it ties everything together.    I think at some point in the upcoming crossover with the flash, Barry is going to tell Oliver that he can travel back in time. I think Barry and Oliver will some how travel back in time and save Sara thus preventing any of this from happening and Oliver never has to join the league.       It was mostly small bits of the title music for spider-man 2 that I noticed quietly remixed in a couple of the action sequences involving Wanda Maximoff sounded very Danny Elfman esque.    i thought it was pretty weak. i haven't seen the movie yet but it just felt bit disappointing. I would of been happy if the spidey one was real.    Type cast? hes only been in guardians and now in Jurassic world. That is not being type cast.       broadwell cpu. Nice. 960m is also pretty solid. decent for 1080p gameplay.    I don't know why your being downvoted this would be the best option if something like this were to happen   They were standing in a police station i dont see how wells would of gotten away with it.                   By doing what ever the f I want       some of its ok if the chick sems to enjoy it but I've seen it to point where it sounds like their in pain and im just yea im done lol.    I actually don't mind this. lol.       I tried the code and it doesn't work.          I went to buy it from nuveem but its still not available there. Any other places that have the price as low as nuveem did?    I went to buy it from Nuveem but its still not available there. Any other places that have the price as low as nuveem did?   before I forget , credit to the original post http://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/336yil/what_is_this_a_billboard_for_ants/   Don't all marvel movies use the stero d logo?   it will be this year guardians of the galaxy I'm calling it now :)      they could be lying remember they said their was gonna be no post credit scene for the first one and then bam we get the Shawarma scene.          its not aborted. its still in the pipeline its just being reworked to accomodate the new spiderman.    the iron man reboot is quite interesting. its good to know they have a plan when RDJ eventually leaves.    god damn i love these emails. hilarious.    https://wikileaks.org/sony/emails/emailid/88763   If he wanted to watch any of the prequels he could probably get away with just watching revenge of the sith it has enough back story for anakin imo.    Its apparently from the hacked sony emails. so it could be legit.    There are too many story lines and we need to choose which ones we are focusing on and lift out the other ones, ie; could reduce father arc to just Roosevelt?   Could cut out plane crash and Richard destroying spiders and start on armored car  dont start with Spider-Man.let the danger/stakes to NYC build first and then have Spider-Man enter the scene heroically.   Tone down Paul Giamatti performance, so he seems a bit more menacing and less cartoonish.   If you cut Richard from the opening and the plane crash maybe you could instead do Harry coming home and seeing Norman at the top of the movie as a cold open.   Really love Electro  feels like you may not need the scene in his apartment, which makes him seems completely crazy and hard to relate too.   Like the idea that eel goes in his mouth and instead of burrowing, you see it glow within him   Need to set up the Power Plant earlier, visually.   Seems like the movie switches povs a lotwhy are we in Maxs pov during the car chase, worth looking at this playing out from Spideys pov.   There could be a better way to reveal that Peter is missing graduation  maybe when you cut Gwen you cut to the wide shot?    Tiny note  dont think Peter would lie to Gwen about sirens --- maybe he just downplays it   Stan Lee Cameo  maybe need a little more emphasis on Peter here trying to get out of his costume and not be in seenset up a little more the pressure of the principal getting closer and closer to calling his name.   Instead of seeing the ghost of Captain Stacy, can just here the voice in Peters head and maybe flash back to the last movie?  Dont think we should add Cap Stacy back into car chase.   There is too much back and forth with Peter and Gwen  can we recut the Dim Sum scene so that it doesnt feel so repetitive of their break-up in the last movie  Can Peter be more honorable and definitive and less wishy-washy?   Why do we need a year to pass   Harry story feels like the main plot of the movie  Peter should look into the past b/c of Harry  maybe find some photos of them together as kidsuse obsession wall more to set up this part of his past not just what happened to parents.   Not sure what Peter learns at Roosevelt is entirely correct. Were distracted by the idea that Peter became Spider-Man b/c of his fathers blood --- all this special back story with his super-scientist dad fights with the idea that Peter is normal kid from Queens who becomes the greatest super-hero in the world   Andrews performance is all over the placea lot of crying and then a lot of mania. Hard to track him emotionally sometimes. It undermines his reaction to Gwens death b/c he gets upset and emotional a lot.   Dont like the idea that May tells Peter his parents were spies b/c two seconds later he finds out they are not and it again fights with the idea that hes an ordinary kid.   Like the idea that May finds out hes Spider-Man  finds his costume instead of just the rosemary harris wink-wink all the time.   Kind of like the morgue, but hate the dancing mortician  clich.   Are you using VFX to show how Electro is travelling from one point to another (bursts of electricity).   Need to underscore capture of goblinmore sirens as you linger on the clock 1;21, 1:22 am (nice touch).   Surveillance scene should be about following Harry not Peterno one should be following Peter.   Can Electro hum Itsy-Bitsy Spider before he plays it electronicallymaybe we can use this again.   Maybe intercut the ending montage and hearing Gwens speech with someone going into special projects and revealing more easter eggs and see that the rhino case has been broke into and the suit is missinggreat way to transition to rhino ending.   Dont need Aunt May in the kitchen.   Spider-man needs to feel more directly responsible for preventing the planes from crashing.   Dont show New Yorkers looting.   I felt like they just released this teaser because they needed to before people forgot about the movie it didn't interest me at all except for the cool dialog from batman at the end. Maybe I was all hyped out from star wars. Hopefully the second trailer is better.    All of them. Find which suits your tastes better and stick with that.    They already have announced a spin off movie. its called rogue one.       Transcendence is so bad tho. I usually like Depp but his performance was so bland.    i hated 2 but like 3 and 4 and 1.    The Star Wars prequels. I grew up with these and love them. You guys had the OTT and I had the prequels and you cant take that away.       i think skyrims even gone cheaper than that for like $3 or something.       it was available in 3D in countries outside the U.S.      I am and I cant fucking wait!   Space battles will probably come later with DLC. I guarantee it. Don't tell me DICE don't have something like that planned in the future.      	200
 That technique works wonders in r/news and r/worldnews as well.    To be fair, I've known plenty of guys who have made a tinder account for the same reason. But I do agree that their are some super shitty people on those apps. Congrats on finding your SO by the way!   I think that viewing this situation in an empathetic manner is key. We should be empathetic for op who is a person who happens to be a guy; it's unfortunate that he was labeled as a rapist/sexual predator/etc. simply because he was walking in the same direction as a person who is a woman was walking. We should also be empathetic for the person who is a woman, however, because her feeling threatened by such a little thing is also unfortunate. While I am in no way condoning her being rude afterwards - wrongly accusing someone as being something as heinous as a sexual predator is not something that should just be brushed off and ignored because such a title carries significant social and legal repercussions for the person receiving the title - the fact that we live in a world where such caution needs to be taken shows that a problem of how we as a society handle sexual assault - both in terms of the treatment of the victims of the crime and the people who are wrongfully accused of committing or planning to commit such inhuman acts - does exist. In my perfect world, people who are women would not have to always feel fearful of being the victims of rape/sexual assualt/etc and people who are men would not have to live in fear of having their benign actions being viewed as lecherous motives.    Damn, I didn't know that you could smoke WITH bubblers! Are they good at cornering?  	4

 Thank you! :) Wish there was more I could say than just thank you on here haha   Sorry, not quite sure what you are talking about here.  If you mean "where is the iOS/Android dev", well... I could do android (don't have a mac) depending on the interest.   Haha, yeah, I've been a bit of a worry-wart when it comes to posting here.  partially because I haven't been sure whether people would enjoy it, partially because I'm super critical of myself, and worry about whether it's good enough.  It makes gives me confidence that you say this though, so thank you, and I'll do my best in the future to post it here/there more! :)   You're welcome!  I hope you find this all useful :)   Haha, yeah, I need to figure out a lot of noise issues (my apartment is too loud lol).  It gets better in future videos I think, but I'll make sure to double check it further in the future too :)   Of course! :)   Thank you! :) I've been contemplating how to do that still actually, and my only concern is I want to make sure that when I show that, I do so properly (especially since I want to avoid any deprecated OpenGL stuff).  While I'm 99% sure I'm fully up to date on everything, there's still a few minor things before I officially do that, but that's my current plan for season 2 :)   And in reference to your specific stream idea: Just go for it :) I did a test run with some extra videos prior, which is what motivated me to do more.  If you find yourself being less productive, then you can always stop streaming :)   Sure!  Honestly, I feel like overall it's had an incredibly positive impact.  Obviously because I'm doing the stream to make games, I've made a ton of games during this time, but there's also been a huge awareness to the quality of what I make as well that's occurred.  Now when I make a game, I find myself a bit less worried about the quality for my private code, but more worried when I publish things (which I think is good, though I suppose that's debatable).  The other big thing that's been helpful is that it's forced me to learn proper terminology, something I've pushed off a ton during my school years.  That is to say, making sure that when I am talking about references vs pointers, I am able to give a more technical definition, as well as a general explanation.  I'm still working on this personally, but it's a lot better than when I started.  Finally, I've learned about a lot of new tools for my videos, as I didn't want to spend a whole lot of time with setup and such.  Thus I've learned a lot more about other engines, in order to simplify my development.  As an example: I recently learned a lot about Three.js as another potential series.  So when I went to work one week and needed to use it, I was able to use it there, without needing to do a whole lot of extra research on what I wanted to do.  And obviously of course I've learned some new things about C++ and SFML along the way :)  TL;DR: My code quality awareness has gone up, my use of proper terminology has gotten better, and I've learned a ton of new APIs thanks to this stream.   Thank you!  It really excites me to see so many people interested in this! :)  	10
 You are actually in agreement, even though your first words are in contradiction with everything else you/I have said. Education is not equivalent to college. There are many many forms of education. But, a ward of the state must be offered some training to become useful in society. Failure to fulfill this obligation, on the part of the state, is leaving such a person to do what they must to survive, which, unfortunately, very often leads to a life of 'crime'.  So yes, your initial description is spot on.   Why do you think it shouldn't be free? Please offer the reasoning behind your thinking.   And if so, how do you propose we accomplish a zero cost of education for every citizen of the United States.   I'm sorry man. Thank you for clarifying what you intended to say.  But, because of where I am from, I can not but reject your logic. If desperation is a licence to forsake virtue, then all is lost. Case in point: much of Sub-Saharan Africa. Many of these people can be considered 'descent' human beings as evidenced when they migrate and are immersed into 'developed'/'stable' economies in Europe or America. But take a look at the turmoil, violence, corruption and all manner of ills which, according to your logic, is perfectly acceptable because they are 'starving' to death.      Cool. I'm almost done with my graduate studies. I'm trying to learn German in the hopes to do a postdoc and work a few years as a researcher there before I move to Africa where I feel there is a much more serious need for education and, to a smaller degree, applied research.   Where did you move to? edit: might-move. For the life of me, swipe makes my writing sound retarded.   There is no where in the world that says this is what financial aid should be. You describe the status quo, which is broken. For a civilized country, a well educated citizenry is the only way to remain civilized. This is the primary role/function of any state. It is the very reason for its existence!  edit: primary 'rule' - primary role/function   This is still not right. It's unaffordable period.   Here's an idea, let's make this the number one election issue. I mean, every young person in the nation votes on just this one issue: the candidate who will make free education, and I mean completely free education, his / her number 1 (and probably only) priority!    Why are you still under your parents? Why are they still claiming you as a dependent?   Details. How did this work out?   He meant puking outback steaks he had the night before, folks. No?   I think that cut a little too deep for some folks. Leave noodles out of it man. Just leave it.   Where did you get that "they are more accountable" from? The most accountable form of government is at the local level.   Likewise bud.   Imagine living in a body with this punt of flexibility and fluidness day in and day out. That would be a delight. My kids will all do gymnastics and or ballerina. At least to learn how to move.   Wow. Vulgar but poetic.   This is true. But many people indulging in something does not make it right.   Look at this guy. First you ask me to agree to disagree and then you hit me with something I agree with! Just who do you think you are?! Yes, clearly the planet has gone to shyt with very many people who should not be on this earth. Except they are here because people created an environment suitable for them. What I think we agree to disagree on is what to do about them. You killing people is different from them dying.    The only place I see a difference is when you are defending a loved one or someone who is in immediate danger, and even in this case, as a last resort. Note here that the overriding thought is to protect, help, save, these are all good things. But when you delve into the realm of revenge, the overriding thoughts are to inflict pain, suffering, etc never anything benevolent. I believe it is the volition (thought/wish) behind an act that determines whether it is right or wrong (good or bad).   No I can not. What I see is two killers, and they both have their reasons. One for pleasure, and the other for revenge.   2ndly, Christ was also reported to have dined with the affluent as well.    You're not entitled to making or fabricating hypothetical interpretations where there are facts. According to the accounts Joseph owned his own shop. So hinting that he 'could have been employed by someone else' is just making things up. But you can maintain your opinion, you are free to have them. Just pointing out that it is wrong.   Actually, the fed is big because of its role/powers. Shift the powers to the state, and they will be just as big.   Your comments are disturbing. The same hate that led the one you complain about is brewing in you. It is the exact same thing, can't you see that?   This is what every single person in the history of the world said. It's interesting how everyone has the feeling of uniqueness or being the exception.   This. How people cannot see clearly here that it's worded expressly to subject people to a group of people (namely the church), is just a result of lazy thinking.   States are also governments too. How come the desire for smallness doesn't extend to the state 'government'?   This is a common but deliberate misconception about Him. Joseph owned his own carpenter shop. Think small business owner and a healthy middle class family - no excessive wealth but also not poor. He was well to do. Being a carpenter and owning your own business with several employees isn't being poor!  Edit: Ah yes. Down vote facts because they do not conveniently agree with your self delusions.   Clearly sir, you need to grab a book on the subject. No, I mean that in all seriousness. Saying that one with virtues will be poor or destitute just shows you don't fully understand what they are and how they operate.   That other incentives pail in comparison. Virtues and their corrupt equivalents are far more powerful. Think about hate and how much it can motivate a person. No amount of money in the world can compare.   Not worrying about rent is not equivalent to not paying for it or setting to it that you have a means to do so. Look up the word worry.    I disagree. It's just a mind thing.   How do you figure that? Having 10000 people sign up is already 1 million dollars to 'process' people. Really, it's a line in a database you're paying $100 for... That is a LOT of money   Relax Bro. I heard your sigh from way out here.   I call bullshit seconds.   Ethics. Why do you not see anything wrong with this?  	37
       how do I export skeletal animation with cry blend with the latest release of cry blend?   I don't have photoshop though     Every time I bring in a texture in as a .tiff or .psd, nothing shows up. It's just a "Replace Me" cube. What do I do? Please don't point me to the manual, as I have already read it. The cryblend manual dosnt work either. Tell me please, what are the steps to add textures to my blender exported model. Maybe I'm not doing it right.    Maybe I should try sending a 16 bit file rather than the standard 8 bit ptex file. I just don't know!     The ptex texture appears blurry and transparent. What might I do?    When I go to shaded view mode, all I see is a crystal clear gray texture. Send to maya didn't work. P.S. I'm using mudbox to maya.   I'm wondering.            K thx   Just need to know.         Has anyone ever tried this? My pooch is a border collie, so she's pretty smart. But I'm not sure if I'll be able to get her to stay still to take that many pictures of her.     Basically, I divided my mesh into multiple sections using the p seperate command. Then, when I was done unwrapping, I used the mirror modifier to make my mesh whole. However, when I want to add texture, I have to add materials to each seperate section of the mesh. If I join all the objects together, it makes a huge mess. What do I do?   You got me! April fools to this faggot sub!   Simply realistic looking terrain.   Other than massive data sizes and textures being loaded procedurally like in Rage, I don't see anything too bad.   Terrain in unreal engine looks just so bad! Think of the game Rage. If you let it sit for a while, it would look amazing. With unreal engine, if we can preload the textures so we don't have the same problems as rage, we could create an amazing looking game.     Okay. So, what we do is we create one big ass map in a 3d modeling program and compose a texture atlas. We export that as an fbx and bring it into unreal engine. Using gimp or photoshop, we create an even bigger ass image texture. Finally, we unwrap that kush and bam, a realistic map. I think this would do great with terrain, as Unreal Engine isn't good with rendering dirt or sand. The only flaws I see with my idea is: A: How do we get the image to unwrap in specific areas? B: How big of an image would we need?   basically I have a warehouse, and I want to apply seperate materials to certain parts. I don't want to have to export dozens of files. What do I do?     So I create a new pallet, then what?         Oh, well are there any 3d printing subs?      Winning the race really     Today was our track meet. It was but a fine day for running, as the weather was well suited for the track season. I was running the 300m hurdles. I was doing brilliant. I was in third place, and edging ever so close to passing the individual in second place. Suddenly, the unthinkable happens. I fall. I go from 3rd to last place. I fall in front of my family, my girlfriend, and 1000 people.  But this isn't the first time. It's been like this for ages. I just never meet my own expectations whether it be sports or school. I'm just done. I'm ready to go.         I was thinking of me in one of those green morph suits and holding her paws with the gun and then painting me out later in AE.            For me, I usually recalculate area normals and remove modifiers.    Dump em'   The object   So I can bake my rendered textures to the model and then export it?      I specifically want to send a prerendered model to cryengine. I believe renderman can export .fbx and .objs?      I mean, you guys are r/disney. Y'all should have some experience with animation.     	46
 Cool.      You *really* think Missouri is an Arkansas   Bama/MSU win away from being ranked in the top 4? The team that lost 34-0 to the only currently ranked team they've played this year?   As a counterpoint, Florida State is most definitely where they are purely because of their margin of victory.   I mean... Muschamp's 3 prior years at UF they've had the #10 (small class), #4, and #2 recruiting class. Being "not a great coach" is still pretty important.   Okay :(    I also previously predicted that since Minnesota was the first ranked team to lose and not move down a single spot  Utah was ranked 17th in the week 10 poll, lost, and still ranked 17th in the week 11 poll. Minnesota was not first.   Ok that's fair. Sorry, my heart rate is basically just set at 140BPM for the rest of the season.   If you think for one second the UCLA deserves, or that the committee is going to be in front of FSU, you're nuts.   Right now, we could probably use some of their linebackers.   Well we had 5 turnovers giving you several short yardage TD's and an offense that couldn't control an alarm clock.    Greenbow Alabama was filmed in Savannah, GA. Let the hate continue.   Well we'd be the other exception then because we have a better history than Florida.   Top 4 anyways. Depending on how you view Osborne, Wilkinson, Hayes, Joe Pa, and Bear.   I actually honestly don't. It's extremely hard to go 10-0* against bowl-eligible P5 teams. Especially when 6 of them have a bye or an FCS opponent the week before they play you.  *Depending on if Virginia beats VT next weekend   Yep, Florida State has 14, Texas has 9, but USC has never had more than 7, which was during the pete carroll era.   yea but   No way. If Oregon is the only school in front of you that loses you're still sitting on the outside.   Going by the BCS rankings for the BCS era.   and #3 vs. #127  EDIT SORRY WRONG POLL:  #1 vs. #127   But really though, I counted 5 drops that went straight through the hands of our recievers, including one in the endzone. We were getting murdered by drops, and to suggest that the rain helps with that isn't exactly a far reach.   In 2007, Kansas was ranked #2 behind 10-1 LSU. At the time Kansas did not have a single win over a currently ranked opponent. LSU had wins over then ranked #8 Virginia Tech, #12 Florida, and #23 South Carolina.  And for bizarre coincidence: Oregon could easily end up with its best three wins being #8 UCLA, #12 Michigan State, and #23 Utah; with FSU having no wins ranked in the top 20 on tuesday.   To be fair, both of those actions constitute a pretty awful job of regrouping.   Nah, we stay three this week, then drop to #6 or 7 next week with a loss to UF, then climb back up to #4 with a win over GT.   Fans get chaos. FSU gets to play in New Orleans. We all win.   It only has one eyebrow.   Florida State.  UF Zook's us for our final regular season game, meanwhile GT beats UGA, and Ole Miss wins the eggs bowl knocking Mississippi State out. Baylor loses to KSU, and Ohio State loses to Wisconsin the in the B1G championship game. FSU proceeds to knock out #13 ranked GT in the ACCCG and climbs back up into 4th, with TCU being the 3rd seed.   I mean - he probably definitely should have been ejected going by the rulebook. But any given college football game has dozens and dozens of actions where the referee crew varies from the rule book (see: the rulebook definition of holding), so I'm fine with the referee crew deciding that in this case his shove wasn't worthy of an ejection.   That ref shoving thread is an absolute bloodbath for nole flairs.   I don't think the FSU fans on the sub is that much of a difference. For starters, we have a quarterback that is absolutely hated by the sub (see [comments like this](http://www.reddit.com/r/CFB/comments/2jny8u/post_game_thread_2_fsu_defeats_5_notre_dame_3127/cldgba4),) so right away the people we want to succeed are getting run through the mud by the masses. Additionally, there are a *lot* of people here who think we don't even deserve to be in the playoffs because of the way we played; something FSU fans disagree with. Those two factors working in concert have given rise to a back-and-forth of persecution complex and actual persecution between the FSU fans and everyone else.    I think at the end of the day you have to decide the value of "quality wins", or how you look doing it, versus the fact that *you are simply winning.* We can all agree that in marshall's case the former clearly outweighs the latter, and in Oregon's case the latter outweighs the former. FSU is a pretty tricky middle ground though, because they've faced a decent but not too difficult overall schedule and have won unconvincingly, but the loss column is still the best in the country. Deciding which one is actually more valuable is a pretty impossible task.   I side with FSU fans obviously, in thinking that even when we have a down game (or 6) and are dealing with injuries (11 starters missing time so far this season), managing to end up with the win anyways for 11 straight games is still an immensely value trait to have; and it's something no other P5 has been able to do. I definitely don't think we're the best team in the country, but I do think we're the hardest to beat.   I think writing FSU off as lucky is extremely unfair. Nobody thought Auburn didn't deserve to be in the championship game because of that miraculous touchdown against Georgia, or the kick-6. I don't see why we shouldn't get the same benefit of the doubt.   Charles Kelly isn't terrible, but he's no Jeremy Pruitt and definitely no Mark Stoops.   Don't worry, we're like 2-0 this year when leading at halftime.   That's the Florida State first half we all know and love.   I think an important distinction to make is that Purdue hasn't won 5 national championships the last 30 years.   Fun fact: no player on an opposing team has had the game high rebounding total outright yet this season. Between Harris and Vuc we're 12-0 with two ties.   A little, yeah :/   Congrats on proving that two of the 20 greatest players of all time could only barely carry bad teams to low playoff seeds. This for sure proves Kevin Love isn't one of the 20 greatest players of all time.  Great detective work indeed.     Yep. Florida State actually has fewer overall games because 12 of their wins from 06/07 were vacated.   Fun little tidbit: As of this past weekend, there is almost a three-way tie for the most wins of the last 25 years. School records for 1990 to present are:  Nebraska: 238-78-1   Florida:   237-77-1   Florida State: 237-67-1  There are a lot of scenarios that could play out for the title. For instance, the UF/FSU game will probably decide who takes the lead between the two Florida teams. If Florida State makes it to, and wins, the national championship they could win outright; unless Nebraska makes it to, and wins, the the B1G and their bowl game. Nebraska has a tough final two games, and if they lose out Florida could take the lead by upsetting FSU.   Are you telling me an OJ Mayo/Dion Waiters backcourt wouldn't make you drool? /s   I don't think people quite realize, it's not that Marshall isn't a P5 school, it's that they have possibly the weakest schedule in the *entire* fbs division. Their four best wins would would seriously hurt any school in the top 15 as an OOC schedule.   Additionally, in future years if there are 4 1-loss schools with resumes like Oregon/Bama, which is not at all unlikely, it could very well mean leaving an undefeated team out of the playoffs.   FSU being ranked #1 would mean playing in NOLA which is way way more advantageous than a Rose Bowl game against Oregon.   I mean... maybe. As far as potential quality wins left on the schedule, a win over Ole Miss will probably look better than any of TCU's remaining wins, and whoever OSU ends up playing in the B1G championship game. Considering Miss St already has ground on both of them in the eyes of the committee it'll come down to what value a conference championship actually holds, but if I had to, I would definitely take MSU over both of those teams.   If that happened I don't think too many people would disagree that those two teams deserved to be in the final.   To be honest, I want Miss St. to beat Ole Miss and pass us... playing in New Orleans as the 4th seed would be way way better for us.  Or, Bama/Oregon losing would work too.   I mean, Bobby Bowden went 18 straight years without losing more than 4 games.   I don't know what Florida State has to do with a comparison between MSU and TCU.   It's hard to believe you guys should jump last week's #1 team in the country who suffered a road loss against this weeks #2 team in the country after you beat Kansas by 4 points.   Nope. Missouri will very likely climb back in as an 8-2 team.  the B1G will hold pat with 4.   I think it's highly unlikely. Even if one of Miss St./Alabama lose in the regular season and you defeat the other in SECCG, there's still   - Oregon   - FSU   - TCU   - Baylor   - Ohio State  You'll probably have more impressive wins than most of them by the end of the year, but you also have two very bad losses. You probably need 2 of them to lose to be in. If both Bama/MSU win out and you defeat Bama, then MSU would still probably go over you guys as well.   I mean, we're 2 wins behind the winningest school of the last quarter-century (Nebraska, 238 to 236), and averaged 10.3 wins per season under Jimbo before Jameis came along, it's not exactly like we're a flash-in-the-pan success team.   I think us being ahead of TCU, with a much stronger remaining schedule AND a championship game against a presumably ranked team means that there's about 0% chance we fall out of the top 4 by going undefeated. If ASU jumped us it would be at the expense of beating Oregon, and I think there's basically no chance of tOSU or Baylor climbing ahead of us either.  Ironically enough, I would actually love to see Alabama beat Miss St., and Oregon win out, and us take the #4 seed over the #2/3 seed, because we'd fair much better in NOLA 5 hours away from Tally than at the Rose bowl. Or just taking the #1 seed would work too.   Yes, this. And for real life implications - if Bama beats MSU, I wouldn't be shocked for FSU to move to #4. If we continue to get close wins against our opponents, whose to say a TCU that dominates their remaining games with 1 loss against an 11-1 Baylor by 3 points doesn't jump them either?   Really? Not your quarterback?   Prostyle offense? Check    Elite program looking for next years quarterback? Check  One more way to tell Urban Meyer to suck it? Check   A quick review of Alabama's wins against ranked opponents:  1. One overtime win against #20 LSU   Florida State hasn't had a losing record, at all, since 1977.   Fun facts: assuming we both win tomorrow, the totals since 1990 will be:  Nebraska: 238 UF: 237 FSU: 236  However you've also played 10 more games than we have, if you rank by win % we're 2nd among P5 teams at .771 and you guys are 3rd at .760; behind OSU at .774   We had a total of 2 bowl wins in school history before Bobby Bowden took over as head coach. We're currently ranked 113th all-time in total games played.  We are a very young program.   The Magic rookies Elfrid Peyton and Aaron Gordon will have 2 of the 4 best rookie seasons.   I know I know, I just have a chip on my shoulder as a huge Dipo fan the way Giannis was the rookie who came out of last year with seemingly all the hype. I take sick pleasure in belittling his accomplishments.   Fun fact: Aaron Gordon just surpassed Giannis' career high, at 9 months younger and with 77 fewer NBA games.   What are the 16 programs?   FSU was also the preseason #1 in 1993 when they won it all. Historically we've gone #1, #4, and #1 when ranked #1 in the preseason polls.   Kyrie Irving's 2nd career game without an assist.  The 6 total assists by the Cavs this game was a lower than any game by a team these for the past two seasons.  Damn.   He was really good at halftme adjustments last year too (see: Auburn), it was just never apparent because our starters were usually out halfway through the third quarter.   Honestly I would say he's simply gotten better as a coach during his tenure. We probably had the talent to go 12-2 his first two years as coach, and a team that should have gone 13-1 in 2012 (no way we were beating you guys the way EJ played), but his ridiculous conservativism held us back big time offensively; he's shown some really smart playcalling ability these past two years and he's definitely a huge reason we're 22-0 these past two seasons.   No, arguing halftime scores when talking about crushing opponents over a full game is never valid.   49-17 final score though.   Minnesota's last three games are against Iowa (6-2), Wisconsin, Ohio State, and Nebraska. There's a good chance they finish 7-5 or worse and are not really considered a needle-moving quality OOC win.  I hear you though, I think you guys are the better team for sure and are much more likely to make it, I was just responding to the post above that you guys aren't 100% safe as a Big12 playoff invite even if you win out.   I mean if Baylor wins out, they'll have a comparable schedule of good wins (one more better win, against you guys, once worse loss, against WVU), and I would imagine having the conference championship would be the tiebreaker in the committee's eyes.   Huh, I was misinformed. Thanks.   What did he say?   If Baylor wins out (including wins against Oklahoma, Okie St., and Kansas St.) they'll win the conference, and very likely could jump TCU.   This is actually incorrect, we vacated the win, but we did not vacate the appearance. So even going technically by ncaa standards we still have 33 consecutive appearances.   Definitely you guys; the UF alum network in the state of Florida is way more powerful than FSU's.   Standard scoring, need 1 starter:   Lamar Miller v. SD   Justin Forsett v. Ptt   McKinnson v. Wash   What conference did you lose to again?   If*   Don't forget Clemson!   In no particular order, I think it will be:  1. Oregon - Survives Stanford, cruises through the final three games, and with a healthier O-line beats whichever Arizona team makes it to the Pac-12 championship game.  2. Kansas State - despite all three remaining tests being on the road, being the one elite big-12 team with very good defense allows them to win out.  3. Notre Dame - I think not falling very far after the loss to FSU benefits this teams greatly, and they make it by winning out.   4. Georgia - For the SEC West, I'm predicting Auburn to lose to UGA but beat Alabama and Ole Miss; Alabama to beat Miss. State and LSU but lose to Auburn; Ole Miss to lose to both Miss. State and Auburn. That leaves Miss St. (who otherwise wins out) the SECw champion at 11-1 and all other teams with at least 2 losses. I think Georgia will beat Miss St. in the SEC championship game and is the only SEC team to make it because no other SEC team ends the season with only 1 loss. (Yes, I realize predicting that many games is ridiculous)  I think Florida State's shady offensive line and lack of run game will collapse against one of the best defenses in the nation this Thursday, and they lose to Louisville and are out of the playoff picture. I'm also predicting Ohio State to win out and beat Michigan State, but with a weak SoS and a bad loss, they end up being one of the one-loss teams on the outside looking in.      Seriously arguing Davis had a better defensive year than any of Dwight's from 2008-2012 using blocks, steals, and fouls as his substantiation is basically the definition of being a box score expert.   The thing with Tobias is that he's way more of a wildcard than Vuc. We, for the most part, know Vuc's floor as a player. Tobias varies between looking like a career backup worth $4m a year, and a career 19/8/3 guy worth max or near-max. I honestly don't even know what I would extend him for; 4/40 maybe? I can definitely see why he's going to be a bit more polarizing in extension talks.   I actually don't think they would. FSU has no ranked teams left on the schedule, so I don't see them getting a win that will launch them back into it. I expect at least one sec west school to finish with one loss and not win the division; and/or Georgia to be in if they win the SEC. Assuming FSU loses, two spots for SEC schools is a very likely scenario.   With two spots left, I think Notre Dame, Oregon, Baylor, Kansas State, Michigan State, and *maybe* Ohio State would all pass them if those teams run the table, and I think the odds of 5/6 of them lose another game would be pretty slim.   Nope. That article's source is just another person speculating. Still no word as to whether he will or not yet.    Don't be a dick.   Well there are four teams in the SEC West better than the best team in the Pac 12 South so....   I just mean Bobby v. Tom Osborne, sorry, vague language.   All I meant was that there's a very good argument that he's better than Tom Osborne, haha sorry; I don't think he's the greatest football coach ever.   I mean, objectively there's a very very good argument that he is.   Yep, if you do tax high net wealth individuals you may be 35-40hrs 40 weeks a year, but the month leading up to April 15th, and the two weeks leading up to Sept 15th and Oct 15th it's not unusual to go north of 90. It's very specific to your group (and even firm) within the profession.   That's the point of emphasis of his post.   It also matters that their two best players are still young and not in their prime yet.   Are we just ignoring Oladipo now?   Stop.   Why does the PAC 12 continuously do this to itself.   You realize that's very possible... right?   Yes. This is how rankings work. Everybody doesn't get to be in the top-25.   Oregon struggled worse than we did against arguably a worse team than we had, so even in spite of their win it's not like they don't have question marks.   Basically guarantees he **have** to run the table, but at the same time makes running the table a heck of a lot easier.   It's alright. The ACC only needs one ranked team anyways.   curious, how do you measure "moisture" as a percentage?   Ahhh crap, okay: Justin Forsett, TY Hilton or Terrance West at flex??   In the last 30 years Florida State football is #1 in the nation (outright or tied) in the following categories:   winning percentage overall   winning percentage vs major conference teams   winning percentage vs top 25 teams   winning percentage vs final top 25 teams   winning percentage vs final top 10 teams   wins by double digits   blowouts (20+ point wins)   bowl appearances   bowl victories   Top 25 finishes   Top 10 finishes   Top 5 finishes   wins vs bowl teams   wins vs 10-win teams   wins vs the SEC Champion   wins vs the (eventual) National Champion   total wins   Heisman winners    Florida State also has, by far the longest streak of top-5 AP finishes (14) and top-4 AP finishes (13). The second longest streak was Pete Carrol's USC at 7 for both.  Extending it out a little bit, Florida state is also reaching the all-time bowl appearance streak, currently at 32, and only behind Nebraska 35 (1969-2003) and Michigan 33 (1975-2007)     	107
             You mean (shudder) more Chihuahuas ?      Well you have to note one thing about the case. He presented his opinions on Twitter, not on a news broadcast. On his own time and not on company time so to speak. What happened then, and what is incredibly common, is that readers of the tweet took the time to track down who he was and mount a campaign, spreading a call from computer to computer, to **get** him. It worked. No doubt the campaigners felt that they had truly 'accomplished' something. When the dust clears, however, nothing in the social positions of the groups mentioned nor in government policy has changed at all. The 'victory' was purely symbolic and illusionary.  As the author mentions these sort of campaigns - and campaign it was - have become the standard crusades for both left and right. They serve as a substitute for real political action. The net result is a more restrictive public space and a build up of ill will on both 'sides' of what is called the 'culture wars'.   This results in a certain amount of harm for a gain of nothing at all.   I can imagine that any planets laying in 'the line of fire' so to speak and close enough (how far ?) would be sterilized.  Most planets in any galaxy, however, wouldn't fit these two criteria.      Yes, in conversation with you and others I've been convinced that the headline is exaggerated.                   Well I disagree. Invoking the 'tu quoque' card may be a debate ender in philosophy seminars, but in the real world where interests are at stake (always) and it is a matter of political debate it is very much legitimate. In other words 'academic purity' is only applicable when there is absolutely nothing at stake. Life is not a seminar.  To be all academic about it the 'argument by analogy' I presented is very much to the point. No doubt any debt can be paid off if it is reduced enough and delayed long enough. A recipient of such generous largesse isn't on the 'moral high ground' when dunning others to 'replay their debt' unless, of course, they are willing to extend the creditor the same advantage they had. The whole matter is actually in the Bible where Jesus speaks of motes in your neighbour's eye and beams in one's own. One of the many quotations about hypocrisy.            The first thing you should 'make of this' is that you should chose evidence that actually supports your case. The article you linked to states *very clearly* that there were times when the debt was reduced ie part of it was written off and the payment term extended. It is as if I were to take out a $5000 loan with an agreement to pay it back in five years. One year later my debt would be reduced to $4000, and the new terms were ten years. Six years later the debt would be reduced to $2000 and I would be given 20 years to pay. Finally, ten years later, the sum would be reduced to $500 and I was given a final 5 years to pay. At the end of that term I paid it off. I'd like it if I could get loans from the same lenders as Germany did.  As to 'tu quoque' it doesn't apply in a situation where the argument is about the moral standing of one party in relation to its denigration of another party. In that (this !) case "you too" is very applicable because the subject is very much the moral standing of an accuser.                               The improperly credited item above was first posted on reddit in r/worldanarchism.               I know, but they are trying to enforce their policy a bit more strictly. This case isn't the only one where presently a true name could endanger the user.                                       I'd think the major concern would be the usual rail accident with far worse consequences.      If you're thinking of a new mission then 'next' is a matter of more than a decade. To my knowledge other missions have priority.      This has been discussed several times before. My main disagreement is that he says that humanity's 'war-like nature' will kill us off here on Earth. My trouble with this is that, if true, said nature will come right along with us into space.   It would be interesting to see such songs done in different genres...rap, country and western, blues, classical, etc. Could be fun.   Well, I have to say that that is an ingenious experiment.      I wonder if New Horizons will discover yet more moons.                  But that's beneficial to India in monetary terms.   Yes, that's possible in theory. Remember, however, that 'non-infectious' is not the same as 'non-pathogenic'. In terms of the microbiome an organism has to be 'infectious' in order to establish a commensal or mutualistic relation with the host.   I assume it means income as in "I live on my salary of x dollars per week.                        That's likely to happen.      It's been in the news in 'dribs and drabs'. The thing the NYT is reporting is the 500+ page report that has been released.      The authors discount that possibility. No doubt the pesticides aren't helping, but there are other factors at work as well.      It's sad. I hope it isn't indicative of a general trend of moral decay because of partisanship.            I never noticed the analogy as well as you have, but it is for sure provocative.         Yes, the terminology is difficult. I presume they meant to include *both* recognition and the subsequent actions of the microbes. Personally I think 'selection' would have been a better choice, but then it would be confused with 'natural selection'.   I guess. Scientology, however, is not the only source of opposition to the theories and especially the practices of clinical psychology. It isn't even the most important one. What it is, however, is the organization that does it best to profit from the dispute.         My first guess is that they would be *more* likely to develop an allergy due to an enhanced response to such organisms. The establishment of tolerance as in the 'hygiene hypothesis' requires chronic exposure in my opinion, not the episodic exposure of a vaccine.   Thanks, that's an important thing to point out.         Try to watch what your bot is doing.                        Never in my basement, though there are usually a few nests just outside my side door.                                                                                                      Seems the knives are really out in the boardroom. It would be great if there was a source as to the **financial** reasons behind the power struggle. The ideological reasons may be fine, but I'm sure they are not the whole story by far.                           Will do. There may be a 'security problem' on their part depending upon where they are presently living. Being as they are Kurds you might want to query 'democratic confederalism' and not just 'anarchism'.      The collection comes from 'Mideast Tunes' which features 'progressive' musicians rather than specifically anarchist ones. I'll see if I can dig up anything on the individuals mentioned.            I hope other statements are forthcoming soon.   One of the "missing pieces" in the general debate about what Syriza should or shouldn't do is the matter of 'tax dodging' amongst corporations and wealthy individuals in Greece. From what I understand the prevalence of this in Greece is higher than it is even in Italy. I don't have the references in hand, but my understanding is that Syriza's efforts on this issue have been weak at best. The international bankers and other institutions are quite unconcerned with this aspect of the Greek crisis. One might suspect that tightening up is the *last* thing they would want.                  Yes, it's sad but predictable. I'm interested in what will happen in terms of the internal disputes within Syriza itself. Also in the actual story behind the story of Varoufakis' resignation. From what I have seen he is reluctant to speak plainly about the disputes that led up to his replacement. Trying to 'reform' a social democratic party is almost always a fruitless quest given the 'coalition' nature of all such parties. Greece differs from other situations only in the speed with which events developed and the importance of the subject of the internal debates.                                                                                                                      The smoke extends that far ? The fires are mainly in BC and Saskatchewan. That is some distance. When Mount St. Helens blew the atmospheric effects were apparent over a thousand miles away. It's likely you will be seeing blood red suns and not just moons near sunset.           	199

 Power bills in the $10m range. That's per month. With current processor and system architectures a true exaflop capable machine would -literally- require a dedicated nuclear power facility.   Your living room would be very well heated.    He claims to have done the software legwork but that doesn't appear to be part of the story yet. In fact that is the meatiest thing here--and all C based?    Well, at least you can be pretty certain you're using all 8. The risk for so-called dark silicon is something of a topic to consider with these puppies.         That's some Grade A hexagonia coral. They are very simple to polish by hand, by the way, although that one will be pocky. Get a tough sanding sponge, then gradually get a finer grain and you'll have a nice shined piece with a few hours of work (I do this when I sometimes watch TV or listen to NPR or just need stress relief).            You will probably using something like a Knights Landing/Knights Corner architecture for AI...It's not quite there yet, very HPC focused. But the days of the discrete GPU for these kinds of things are numbered--having it all on the die this (and OpenPower architectures on the way with NVlink) will make your work great fun--and ultra high performance.   couldn't agree more but for the big exascale folks, it's going to boil down to raw performance per watt. That's where this battle will really heat up--at this point no way to tell how differentiated.   He is a giant. I believe over 7 feet tall. And one of my favorite writers. It's a shame that's the only comment this brings forth.       Yeah, but I'm not a subscriber      Weird--I see the whole thing, not sure what the difference is.            Not sure where you found it but it could also be ancient pottery. I found a few similar pieces in the South that looked like wave-formed sandstone (albeit darker) and found it was burnished pottery.            Dear sweet jesus, bacon agate. That just set off sparks in my brain.    These are good points. How common are these scenarios though outside of research HPC?      Bryozoa      I used to make the mistake thinking they were fish fins on finds from the U.P. in northern Michigan--these are abundant there as well.   I've never seen anything like the garnet inside the quartz--amazing find!                           I hereby coin the phrase "Tampa as fuck." -- Because yes, this is story is Tamp.... yeah. You get it.   Wow. That is the most obviously fake thing I've seen in a long time. Bravo! I watched it twice for fun.   When you say it like that I want something with guacamole. And I would drive to India to get it right now.   He is disturbingly ripped and tan for an old white politician. It just makes this all the more Michael Bay-ey. We need to just stop fucking around and just hire all semi-well-aged post action film career-oriented actors as the symbols of presidential authoritah.   On second thought, Team America World Police"   This text is ripped right from the script of a Michael Bay film.    And even though it's for zombies and it's silly, when you think about it, the intro/soundtrack at the beginning just keeps splitting into my mind when I watch what's happening. Or building, more accurately. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y26TQKczaaY   Another. Because this is what is was made for. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lfInFVPkQs   Let me add to this.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRl3sOBRKAs  I'm showing my old age. But damn. It's starting again. I can feel it. Can you?      If everyone is looking for a panic story, they're now in luck. This is the only time I've been worried about Ebola in the US--no story has convinced me that it's anything good sanitization and medical practices couldn't fix. But this...this is actually news.   This is a very half-assed news article. What's up with the BBC these days? No context, errors, etc.   So very very tired of shallow Hadoop reporting.   Or fossilized hexagonia coral (aka "Petoskey Stone")   The link there was the press release rehashed. The only real details to be found about the system is here http://www.hpcwire.com/2014/07/10/los-alamos-lead-shares-trinity-feeds-speeds/   This was written by a fifth grader.   For now. But they had one four years ago. Then they took the top. Now they have a ton of funding (U.S.'s not there) and now they're building more AND building their own stuff (i.e. not reliant on American tech for their high end computing). It's significant as a trend.   	56
 Cocaine.      Key plot points are mentioned once, then thrown aside for another three episodes. Did you remember there was a missing girl until yesterdays episode? No, no you didnt. Peoples names are mumbled, and unless you have been making your own police procedural board at home, you have no idea why any of them are important. Each scene is set up in the first two sentences, so if you miss those, you are cast adrift for the next 10 minutes. Youre pausing the TV and turning to your already annoyed other half, saying: Er, so, just to recap  these people are  bad?   Think that was a point alright.              	7

 Thank you.   This is a really touching read. We all derive fulfillment through helping others. We all need to be needed. We're like gears, our interdependence is what gives our lives meaning.   I found:  It gave me something to focus on besides my grief and turned me into someone my brother would be proud of.  especially inspiring. I'm really glad to hear you're doing better. Remember that those close to you have the same human need to help others, so don't be afraid to reach out to them. Take good care of yourself.    That's a sweet proposal story! I guesstimated my wife's ring size by casually letting her mess around with an old ring I normally wore. When she slipped it on, it seemed to fit perfectly, so I figured "If it fits me, it'll fit her" was a good philosophy for engagement ring shopping.   Then when I bought the ring it was too big for her. Apparently my own ring was slightly tight on me and slightly loose on her.   It was ok, because it's always easier to resize a too big ring than a too small ring (plus, a girl will feel embarrassed if her finger is too big to fit into the ring). Unfortunately I hadn't purchased the "re-sizing insurance" thing, so it was extra.    TLDR: Always buy a slightly too big ring, and re-sizing insurance.     Thank you.    Yes it's my name (I don't normally give personal information, but I figured first names would be ok because I didn't expect many people to see this). I grew up in the U.S., but my parents are Indian. Take care.   	5
 I am currently on POF. I have also labeled myself as "average" body type. I gained some weight when my kate fianc passed away. I have always been in great shape, and I am a very attractive woman. (I have been told by so many people throughout my life. No I do not have a big head.) Figured it would be good to get back into dating online and try things out. Although my body type says "average", I have lost 30+ in a few short months. I still have more to go. But by eating healthy and actually getting out of bed and starting my days makes that much of a difference- I was so depressed for the longest time. I do let the men I talk to know that I am on this journey and if they can accept me now, they will be more accepting when I reach my goal.   I'm not telling you this to feel bad for me or anything, just sharing so you know not all "fatties" wanted to be that way. And that some of us are making the conscious effort to better ourselves.    Some people are so strange.    One time my (ex) boyfriend ate me out at a restaurant under the table. It was a really dark restaurant and the table clothes were touching the ground. The waiter came up to the table and realized he was missing said I could order for him if I knew what he wanted. I told her to come back in ten minutes that he left his wallet at home. Honestly that was the best ever and I do not feel guilty about it at all.    This has to be the funniest shit I have seen in FOREVER   Brandon Novak heroin.    That girls hair extensions look lime sheeeeiiiiittttt   STFU?! As sick as that is- completely badass. CHEERS.    Ohio is 80   This makes my heart happy.    I love you   Prozac saved my social life. My family could deal with my crazy shit but people around me didn't know how...Once I was put on meds, I actually had a true friend.   Hey, any time. Went through that recently as well. Roommate burned my kitchen down.    Positive vibes your way.    I worked at this place called The Barn. It literally is an old red barn from the 20's and opened as a bar in 1934. Anyways, we had a regular (way before my time), whose name is Frank. He passed away about 6-7 years ago. His wife still comes in. He was a huge Captain Morgan drinker and we have his "last bottle" in a shrine/glass box. Frank was know to really dislike rap music so when we had DJ's come in he would flight glasses straight across the bar. Not just push them, as if he was throwing them. When employees, including myself, would be making a burger in the back he would tell us when to flip them. Often I would be checking an I.D of someone's and if they were. underage I would get awalsy a swift tap on on the right shoulder. We knew it was him, never failed to amaze us though.      Mean Girls   First off I live on the edge of suburbia and corn fields. This girl got so drunk she said that she wanted to drive out to the country and hold a family hostage and torture them. She went into extreme detail about this. The whole time with a huge grin on her face.    I own a trailer. Nice one. Newly renovated. Got a roommate. He was struggling with some things had him pay $250 a month in rent. Cheap. Told him no smoking in the house. He got drunk and decided he wanted to make fried chicken. Started the process and then passed out on the couch with a cigarette burning. To my surprise it wasn't the cig that caught my trailer on fire.... He burnt the chicken. Caught my stove on fire and slept threw the whole thing. I work in a bar so I was just getting home around 4 A.M when I saw the paramedics, fire trucks and police officers. He came out unscathed and moved out the. next day. While I had no place to live considering majority of my place was gone. I had to move back home with my parents. Shit sucks.   He got his karma a few months later- got pulled over for a DUI in someone else's truck with no insurance.  EDIT: I have multiple bad roommate stories. I have always had bad luck in this department.   Yeah of course, my cottage is right by there. Scio, Ohio. And I went there for a "religious retreat" (I went to Catholic schools didn't exactly have a choice!)   I'm from Sylvania, Ohio! Small world. About 30 mins from Yipsi.   What really kills my self esteem is when I'm having a great night at work, no tables have complained and everything is prompt. (Fine dining) And then all of a sudden a cook calls you a cunt in front of all the staff because HE fucked up the timing on the ticket. Broke me down. My tables heard and everything. Real self esteem killer.    Very interesting, thank you!    And what is the material they are made out of?    I always thought the Sorell had a little citrus flavor to them. I used to eat them all the time. Still do!    Ya and God forbid I wear actual panties and not a thong and my friends point it out. Jackasses ha   I just watched the trailer and I am terrified.   	26
 This is actually a great story. Not because it's good, and I'm sorry it happened. But...what an exchange. 'Fuck you.' 'Fuck you.'  My aunt was in Chicago and she had her handbag snatched, she chased after him screaming for her passport and, nice of him, he stopped, took it out and threw it for her. He got everything else. But at least she could come home.   True. But I don't think to an incredibly vast expense.   I think too many developers is going to hit the developers hardest, though. Which they should bear in mind.   Been writing for ten years. Spent four years writing and editing a novel, got rejected a few dozen times, and then realised it was shit.  Trying to push out some shorts and poems whenever possible.  Working on next novel. About 25k words in.   Doesn't matter how many people use Unity or UE, not that many people are going to be able to put out games.   Have to say, I agree. These films are excellent.  Skadoosh.   Open Office, on the other hand, is absolutely free. And does the exact same thing to the exact same quality.   I recommend the Ukulele over the guitar. I've been playing for about two weeks and can play four songs. I've been playing Bass on and off for years, and can only just about play three songs.  Also, the ukulele is just the most fun instrument to play. It's so non-serious, and that's great.  I got my Ukulele for 16 off Amazon, which is nothing.   Well spotted. Good game? I do kinda want to buy it.   If you're just remember you have just as many oscars as Leonardo Dicaprio.  If that doesn't work, just imagine a T-rex making a bed.     Fuckin' Borderlands 2. Christ - speak about *too* long.   Yeah, you need a team. You need a whole team and a flawless strategy. You need to be a better gamer than anyone thought possible. Yeah, that's just for local(ish) tournaments.   I think she does bat them off quite quickly by hiding behind the cop's failures, so the FBI don't want to press her too hard. The evidence as it is does add up. But that book was pretty flawed anyway.  She wanted her dead body to wash up on the shore. Great, which would *absolutely* prove that he didn't do it. Fatal flaw in the plan was to not just disappear! Throwing herself off a boat would never have worked.   Also, sorry, just popped over to Booksie. That is not a good looking website. It looks strange, it's not as presentable as it could be, and your stories don't feature as prominently as they should.  I would recommend moving over to Wattpad (which is a much more recognised name). Or even Figment.   (also, you trust a site that let's anyone print off your entire manuscript without any qualms?)   Promote harder. Never stop promoting. Find new ways to promote. Build on old ways to promote. Promote yourself, build up your social media presence, keep people coming back for more. Not the material, it's the coverage. Use other writing sites, too. Put up samples, and then link to a single, main account (which seems like Booksie in your case) and drag them in that way.  Also, having things online doesn't stop them being published. Of course, you'll have to take them down. But no one would forgo a piece of writing because it was on the internet. I've seen a lot of people have that concern, and a lot of people have replied, stating their fears are unfounded. Don't worry :)   The thing about Patreon is that without an audience who does care, you just come off as a money-grabbing asshole. And you don't want that. As mentioned, build up an audience first. Which can take time but will work in the end. There are people out there who write serial novels on wordpress and make a living out of it.  Come up with a great idea, keep at it, keep the momentum going on wordpress as you build up a decent audience. And then, when you have a fair amount of readers, bam! money please :)   The whole point - which is explained in the novel (sorry) - is that she traps him. That, even though her original plan didn't work out, she totally won still. Eventually her 'fake-death', and "rape", were just byproducts of the fact that, eventually, she still has him totally trapped.   If you're definitely going to change your story vastly, then making as resolute an outline of the changed version as possible. You want to make the merger as streamlined as possible. It depends if you want this new draft to resemble the original at all, or not. If you do want to, then just write an outline of changes. Otherwise go full draft.  I've never rewritten something from scratch no. I spent three years writing my novel no way I was going to rewrite the damn thing. But I did spend a year editing it.  You have to be aware of the limitations of your novel. You don't want to spend the next two years reworking this, if you would benefit more from moving on to something else. That's what I had to tell myself. After a year of editing, the novel wasn't getting any better, into the drawer with it. It's definitely something worth doing, rewriting the novel. But give yourself a doable time-frame, and don't ever extend it. Stick to it like your life depends on it.    I am also fine with this word. I like words that aren't in the dictionary, they're the best. Stabby, that's the word I made up today. I had to describe a sharp stone with certain qualities: stabby.   It would be remiss of me not to share my favourite meme of all time.  [I promise, this is the last one](http://imgur.com/RisOcxl)   Hard to say. It's probably worth drafting up a secondary version now, and then distancing yourself from both. As you go through your main, written copy, after your month break, you can compare the written events to the secondary events, and get a feel of how it works out in that scene.  That is what you asked isn't it?   I like to be at least slightly resourceful when it comes to memes and gifs :)   This worked out quite well.  [Just one more gif :)](http://gfycat.com/LikelyHappyAmericanavocet)   Those are my two tips for cheering up. The first is that, whenever you're feeling down, always remember you have just as many Oscars as Leonardo DiCaprio.   The other is the T-Rex thing, perfectly demonstrated in gif form. Which I will cherish forever.   Spain. France. Greece. Malta.  If I live in England, I guess Wales and Scotland count....   Here's a gif of a t-rex trying to make a bed someone made for me:  [Clickity](http://i.imgur.com/sKjhQ6G.gif)  They were asking for ideas to cheer up and I said I always imagine a T-rex trying to make a bed. It worked, and they made a gif of it for me. And I thought it was genius.   I'm sorry, it was meant to be a joke :( My bad for not making it a very good one.   Don't think I'm being too serious. It's common superstition that it's bad luck to talk about Christmas, or sing Christmas songs when it's not Christmas, that's all.     Dude, it's like July. I can't imagine the kind of Sin, Bad-Karma, bad-luck/misfortunate you'll get for invoking the name Christmas.  -makes a cross using fingers, backs away slowly-   Because they already have an excuse for elitism: PCmasterrace.  I'm not just bashing on PC. I'd disagree with anyone who blindly proclaims one console over another. It annoys me when people say get a PS4 purely for the graphics. That ain't logic.   And I know not every single PC player is like that. But I have seen a god awful amount of threads asking about preference towards consoles, and on *every single one* someone pops up and says "PCmasterrace".    Because there are different people.   One is someone who calmly explains the benefits of each system, and why, perhaps, the PC is a better choice, if the asker is so inclined.  Then there are the people who blindly bash away at people who have asked what console to have, spouting mindlessly to get a PC, without any real reason why. The kind of people who don't make cases logically, just blindly declare PC is best for them, and therefore everyone.  Also because, for a post asking about consoles, you have to take a step back and say "Yeah, consoles are great, but have you thought about a PC, here's why..."  They don't do that. If they did that I would be fine with it. It's just when they spout *"Get a PC"*.   We want proof that the underdog can beat the man.  "We learned to root for the underdog because we see ourselves in them".  Add in a post-apocalyptic setting and you've got it.     Well, when you put it like that...   Obviously as PC gamers they don't have anything interesting to say so they just bash on consoles.    Being as it won't be about Joel or Ellie. I doubt it. Trust Druckmann.    No, I was saying that shortcuts and roundabouts don't exist. Not that simply writing was a shortcut. The opposite. There is no easy way.  It's funny how all of these workshops and writing schools have popped up at just the right moment to serve the hundreds of people who want to be writers. How did every single writer before the 21st century manage without attending a seminar on writing?      Fuck, I'm sick of these posts. Not only are there hundreds of them *on this thread alone* there is always the inevitable answer from a goddamn PC-playing elitist telling you to get a PC.   Men do not care. We just don't.    I just don't tell any of my family I write. My friends aren't readers, or writers, so they don't really care. So I miss out a lot of these steps :)   It is commercial, and I know of authors who have recognised that and entered the market for purely financial reasons, but I don't think this is the case for all writers.   Once something gets popular, say, Twilight, a lot of people try to emulate that success, so we get a market saturated with emo vampires. Now Meyer, who is the most successful, isn't to blame here (except for Breaking Dawn). The original trilogy was fine, and she, as a previous author, wasn't just writing for the money (except Breaking Dawn). Those that came after her, copying her, did.   Otherwise, you are perfectly correct.   I think that a lot of trilogies are born from an original thought: What if kids were made to fight in an arena to the death? What if kids were made to run a maze for [twist, twist, twist] reasons. What if there was a society of people who had surgery to make them beautiful at 16?   All of these taglines on their own are pretty awesome. And they stand up as solid novels. But the tagline doesn't extend to the sequels. So they has in a sub-plut (post-apocalypse - evil government, post-apocalypse - evil government, post-apocalypse - evil government)+ and that's how it plays out for the rest of the sequels  +I didn't choose all three of us because they embodied those theme. I chose them because I have read them all, they just so happen to have the same *freaking* antagonist!    Inception!   Structure is sitting down every day at a certain time and writing.   This is a craft, it's art. There is no shortcut to getting better, no trick or roundabout way. There is only one: to write. Everything else is...arbitrary. Except reading.   Look up what everybody's advice is about how to get better at writing. It's not to enhance your vocabulary (which is a side-effect of reading widely and reading well), it's not to read as many 'how-to-write' books as possible (9/10 of which are BS scams anyway). It's to read and to write. That's it.  You want a goal? 500 words a day. If you can put in more time, go for higher. I try and write a thousand. If I'm feeling good, I can pump that out in an hour. Then I move onto my scripts, or writing my games. If I do all that - back to my novel.  You might benefit more from books on writing than I do, I've always found them a waste of time; purely because I could be writing instead.   The technique and ideas for editing have already been pretty thoroughly laid out by others, so here's my two cents.  Traditional publishing and self-publishing are nothing even remotely alike. Don't throw yourself at one or the other. Research and research and research thoroughly. Written accounts, agents accounts, testimonials. Everything, for both sides.  As it stands you have to have a super duper amount of faith in the project to pay someone to work on it.   Even more pertinent: you don't have to worry about any of this until the book is finished. Nothing else matters till then.   Good luck :)   Back in my day, haha. What an expression.   Knowing all the words, and being intimate with all the fiction in the world, won't make you a better writer. Only writing will.   Your plan should read more like:  * 7 Days writing * Read in the evenings * Submit through the evenings.   No point on lingering on it. Our fears didn't come true. Everything is far happier returning to how things were, than lamenting on how things could have been.   Ask her friends. :)   A lot of companies publish all their financial statistics, you just have to rummage around their website long enough to find the boring part. A lot of companies are owned by others, so it's worth finding out who their parent company is first.    "wroters?"  Typo, or...?  There are websites for writing, where you can upload your writing and others can read it. But a lot of these also include forums for various things. Check out Figment and Wattpad.   Speedrunners. So much speedrunners.  Also Team Fortress 2.     Everything you're going to try and do will be to improve it. It's going to change a lot of in editing either way.  I think the best thing to do would be to summarise the plot in bullet points, and then create a list of events that you would change, and then see which one you prefer, which you hate. Once you can see an overview of the new canvas you might see how much you like, or dislike, the new version.   If it changes that's fine, so long as all the changes are for the best. Of course at this stage it might be good seeking other people's opinions, because if you're unsure how to move forward on your own it's always worth just getting a second opinion :)   It needs to attach itself to Parker. All of it's traits are from him. That's the reason he so resembles a spider, why he can do something that resembles web-slinging, and wall-crawling.   My first long-term relationship.  But hey, it first-time relationships aren't for fucking up I don't know what they're for.  Note to self: Find someone who actually gives even a slight shit about your life-goal.   More than like haha. It has quickly gone on to my list of all time favourite things ever.   Just what I need, another depressing song.   -Merrily plods off to listen to the song-   [sent later than it should have been due to there being too much laughter to type.]   Yea, I needed that. That was amazing.   That's not a bad idea.   It wasn't bad, by any stretch. I just found the first half of her life more interesting than the second. Which isn't a reflection on Gainsbourg, because I think she's great. Just that portion of her life was more interesting than when she joined up with that guy and just started torturing people.    That's what I thought. You've had lots of practice.   Would you be interested in starring in my screenplay, Mr. Cruise? It's about a guy who has to run away from things. I feel like you would be the best person for the job.   There is a cost, that's why I have to ask.  I'm a writer. I'm writing a novel, and I'm working hard on it. I'm writing a short film, and I'm writing for some indie game developers as well. I'm doing everything I've always wanted to.  But I got made redundant, about two months ago.   I have enough money saved to keep me going for a few months longer, if I'm careful with it. But it won't last forever.  So my question is; should I continue doing what I'm doing, and pushing myself to fulfill my dream? Or should I get a job?   First half was better than the second, imo. Both were excellent. I'm not sure how this compared to the other two. It just seemed a bit more windy, and fell off track more than the others and you really feel it at moments, particularly the second half.   Yeah, I'm doing that. The same old song. And that's the one put me in the rut in the first place, it's certainly not helping.   But it only comes in the evening...   Nice try ;)   Too damn right. Wish I could do that.   You listen to [one sad song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgmgfDWfOd4), and suddenly you can't shake the irksome feeling of loneliness and inadequacy.  Know what I mean CC?   The best time's I had with my friends were on Halo/Halo Wars online. (We used to kick so much ass one Halo Wars, were unstoppable). Me and a friend got super-amazing at SSB on the gamecube, and later the Wii, to the point where we were so matched out fights would last half-an-hour. But other than that, it was all online regardless.   And Nintendo still do that. Most of their games (Mario Kart, SSB) cater to a couch co-op market.   I don't think I miss sitting at my friends house drinking cheap beer we had nicked from our parents, I miss that time of my life in general. The gaming has little to do it.   And I think if I were to say what I missed specifically it would be the nostalgia speaking. There was nothing explicitly amazing about gaming except how I approached it as a young child new to it all.   I would have liked to have seen games be introduced, and be influenced and been a part of the industry at the time when it was new, and they were just setting the rules.   Whenever I'm down I just remind myself that I have exactly the same amount of Oscar's as Leonardo Di'caprio.    If that doesn't work, I just imagine a T-Rex trying to make a bed.   CGP Grey - surprisingly fascinating videos.   [Andromeda](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=udAL48P5NJU)  This is a compilation of images taken with the Hubble telescope, and gives us the most in depth image of Andromeda ever. The image doesn't just do it justice so I've linked a youtube video.  The video selects a portion of Andromeda, somewhat on the fringes and zooms in. And the image just keeps getting noisier and grainier and it keeps happening, and thousands of dots just keep appearing and appearing. And then you reach a moment where the noise falls apart and you realise that all those tiny pixels you mistook for grains...are fucking stars.   [Also this heartbreaking image, and the story behind it is a really fascinating. Worth looking into, and about the photographer as well.](https://iconicphotos.files.wordpress.com/2009/08/kevin-carter-vulture.jpg?w=700 h=466)  [Also, this guy is a goddamn genius. Linked to his whole website because I couldn't pick a favourite. They're all amazing](http://www.joshuahoffine.com/#/horrordashasdashmetaphor/6)   Missed out on?  Gaming is as good as it's ever been. It's at its peak, better than ever. We have different platforms to purchase games. Making games has become so much easier, leading to an incredible rise in the Indie gaming market, which has given us some of the best games ever made, and allowed hundreds to pursue dreams they otherwise might have to have given up on. I can whip out my phone and play a game any time. And I can do it for free.   The technology is incredible, everything that gaming has to offer is mindblowing. Games are being incorporated into education and healthcare. The console and gaming market is a thriving economy that employs thousands of people globally, and reaches thousands more to give them an outlet of entertainment that can't compare to even a decade ago.  Narrative, and characterisation, alongside fleshed out gameplay have come to a head and that's amazing.   I honestly wouldn't wish for anything else.      First of all, before you separate yourself from your novel for a month, here's what I recommend. Read through it now, and just correct any grammatical mistakes, typo's, just all the little things. While the novel is still fresh in your head. You'll be thanking your old self in a months time after spending so long away from it.  The thing is your first draft is meant to be malleable. The editing stage is the point where the book *changes*. You have to sit back and look and decide what serves the story best. It might turn out that involves changing a whole lot, but hey, your story doesn't deserve any less.  It might take a lot of time to do, so it depends how much time you want to put into it. I spent a year editing my novel for nothing to happen with it. You just gotta do it. Don't hesitate because it's a big undertaking, or because your attached to your work. Gut that manuscript till it's bloodless. It's a hard thing to do, but it absolutely must be done.   Best advice I found when to stop editing? When you find yourself changing things back to what they were originally, stop. You just gotta see what's best for the story. And if you change it only to discover it was better as it was before, now you know. Just change it back, and then leave it for good.       Was about to pop on and recommend this. First comment. I like it =]   Only chance I'm going to get to fly. I get lucid dreams so rarely and I never have full control. I can only tip the current dream I'm having in a favourable direction. If I try and take full control it wakes me up.   Probably Lilo   Stitch. I love the Lion King, and I love Disney but I have this little point inside of me that remembered hating all the Disney movies for no reason other than because I was a young boy, so there's a little residue from that.  Also, just want to point out the *vast* distinction that has to be made between Pixar and Disney. They are not the same thing. Pixar are incredible, Disney are not.   Not a shot at the OP, but Inside Out is *not* a Disney movie.     Ask them to fix it. It's what they ought to have done in the first place, explain your position, I'm sure they'll understand.   Interestingly enough, I live England, and we do not celebrate at all.   When I tell you don't you don't think of an elephant, what's the first thing that pops into your head?  Elephants.   In this instance, Elephant is me googling an animal's penis.   Pphh. You don't avoid boredom. You goddamn embrace it and power through it.    I like the solitude. It's the one time I'm away from a TV or laptop for any length of time. It's just headphones in and being left alone with nothing but your thoughts for an elongated amount of time.   Probably knowing what you're going to do, and what your channel is going to be about helps. That decision should certainly come before contemplating the how of making a video.  Also, production values. Do not underestimate production values. Lights, and a good camera.   Been there!   Hit me with the most random fact you know off the top of your head. If you have to google it, you're cheating.  Keyboards were actually invented to make the user type as *slow* as possible. That's why they're so random. On typewriters, if the user typed too fast the machine would jam. So keys were placed in non-alphabetical order, and as random as possible to slow us down. Then we just got used to them, and they never changed.      What's wrong with Summer Reads?      Dragon Age: Inquisition had a decent system like this. Very similar to how AC did it, but a bit better. Unfortunately the rest of the game is meh.   I saw the film first, when I was quite young. I still think it's a really good film. That certainly hindered my expectations of the book. A few years later I would read American Gods and within a few weeks I would go through the rest of his bibliography.    I thought it was kinda genius. De Niro was actually brilliant in the part.    Late reply sorry. I think it is quite good yes. Definitely vastly superior to Twilight. It might take a little while to get into, it's written like that, but after that it's good.   It does feel like a compiled book of short stories, especially the way it jumps between characters and their events. But, still, if you're interested in Middle-Earth, it's fascinating.   But only what they're allowed to know. That's it. Don't forget they're heavily brainwashed to be very disgusted by the idea of parenthood, and anything natural.   Stardust. Because the book doesn't have Robert De Niro as a cross-dressing sky-pirate. :)   No. The alpha's wouldn't be the people who look after the livestock, they would have no interaction with anything that bred.   Furthermore, there brainwashing would have nothing to say about it. They wouldn't know. Perhaps the lower castes would be brainwashed in a certain manner so they could breed, but not the alphas.    Iyam! And thanks :)   http://bit.ly/1dCgybU  Short link to the vlog for you :)    I don't doubt for a second I can get round to all of those :)   As for 1984, I absolutely loved that book so why not.   Not likely. That was a hearken back to the olde days of...2005/6. Not recently.   You can follow my brand-new vlog where I'll eventually talk about it. I don't want to plug too obviously so I'll wait to see if you're interested before linking.   My sister was a prolific Myspace'r. I guess, in her own humble way, she was myspace famous. Which was *the shit* back in the day. So I guess that's the only reason I got into Myspace.   Back in the old days before Facebook. Rush home from school so you could talk to your mates on MSN. And, of course, make sure your *myspace* page was top-notch.   I do, but I'm keeping a lid on it for now m'afraid.   Yeah I realised my mistake as soon as I made it. Having to make superscript isn't something I often have to do on Reddit. This ( ^ ^ ) is left over my old MSN days. That's how long I've known about it.      Did I miss out the other eye? I meant  ^ ^  =D   I'm exactly the same! I've only just settled down into a nice routine of living my entire life on Reddit. I like this arrangement!   :O Thanks ^^       Malevolent spirits. And how my two protagonists deal with them at three different stages in their lives.   That's enough internet for today.   I'm working on my novel. And I also got a new job writing a short-film for a local film-maker, so that's awesome. Especially when I said I'd work for free and he said he'd pay me so...I'm pretty happy with that :)  	112
 It wasn't founded on it but nearly every religious person living in America at the time was a Christian of some sort.    https://i.imgur.com/MWg8sz0.gif`       reddit can then devolve into the mismanaged, juvenile slapfight it was supposed to be.  *Then?* We're already *there* and have been for a while now.     What doesn't make sense to me is why Ellen and or the admins don't talk to the community  Because we're the peasants and they're better than us so why do they care what the average user of this site thinks? That's how they think.      you people are jumping with joy that this happened so you can, in your minds, prove a point.  They're proving our points for us. We don't need to do anything. This is the umpteenth story about a non-citizen, illegal criminal alien coming into this country and killing someone because of Obama's open borders policy. Bush opened the border up as well though not to such an extent as Obama. The GOP sells out real Americans so that their fat cat donors can get cheap labor while the Dems sell us out so that they can get a giant new voting bloc straight outta Mexico and Central America. Who stands up for real Americans?  http://www.wbaltv.com/news/maryland/baltimore-city/Two-Arrested-After-1-Child-Beheaded-2-Partially-Decapitated/8900586  Bet reddit never read or heard about that. Just one of many stories.    Could someone explain why it's a good idea to not deport people who are in a country illegally?  Because Obama and the Democratic Party want America to turn into Brazil or South Africa demographically so that they never lose another election. Obama is going to amnesty all 11 million + illegal immigrants in this country so that he can ensure that he and the Dems run the country in the future without the GOP standing a chance. It's just racial mob rule democracy that the Founding Fathers never wanted in this country. Dems and Obama don't care. They're done courting the white vote so they're importing as many non-whites as they can who are lower class so that they vote for the party that gives them government benefits.     step down as CEO.  Nope. Her life is on the line, not just her career. No one has a full financial audit/report on her and her husband but the word on the street is that they are bankrupt so she needs this job. If she loses this job somehow then I think that she is done for good in Silicon Valley and possibly elsewhere.    I doubt that she will. I'll bet that when she signed her contract to work for reddit she signed a non-disclosure agreement or something of that nature which prohibits her from discussing her firing.    The funniest thing happening right now is that 4chan's /pol/ board has totally taken over /r/TimAndEric  which has 20k subscribers and it is being spammed with all things /pol/.    Can you link me to the post or comment that you made about this that got you banned? I really want to read this and have it on hand for future reference. Thanks in advance.     linking to gawker   Made it in two minutes.    https://i.imgur.com/EyTTzKy.jpg   This is like War Games between the reddit admin hierarchy and the power mods.

I'm not a part of the reddit mod hierarchy so I'm not privy to such backroom dealings and discussions.    /r/AskReddit is private.

I wonder what's going on in that mod mail right now. karmanaut is the fourth highest mod on the list there so my guess is that he shut the sub down. krispykrackers is the only admin/mod of that sub so she is in a bit of a pickle right now because karmanaut obviously wanted the sub shut down, other mods may have gone along with it, yet these mods don't work for reddit like krispykrackers does. I wonder if Ellen Pao and the other reddit admins or employees will put pressure on krispy to take control of the situation, the subreddit, and of karmanaut.    /r/AskReddit is private.

You misspelled the federal government and the Obama Administration.   I Shorewood like to hear some more stories about that school.    It's not coming home :'(   Now I know why she was a cinema teacher. That's a twist that M. Night Shamalamadingdong would be proud of.    Isn't it ironic? Don't ya think?    ETM wasn't a fan of the gays either if you guys remember him being a little homophobe.   Courtesy of the late, great, Dave Brubeck.   Ted Bra-czynski   Can confirm. Stuck in Mom's basement.    *I like the way ya workin'*  *No dignity*  *I got to bag it up*   Oh, indeed.     The truth is, Roberts is the same fool that believes racism doesn't exist anymore.  No, he just doesn't believe that racism is as virulent and institutionalized as it once was. He doesn't believe that there is no racism. He believes that things like affirmative action are outdated and he is right. Soon, the SCOTUS will be examining an affirmative action case involving a white female applicant to a university that rejected her and admitted a less-qualified black applicant to their university solely due to race. In my opinion, affirmative action policies are racist in and of themselves because they always tend to discriminate against someone due to their race in order to "not discriminate" against someone of another race, gender, sexual orientation, etc.   How is it fair that qualified individuals like this young woman are denied opportunities that they earned so that people who aren't qualified can be made happy? It's total nonsense.   http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/courts_law/supreme-court-to-consider-university-of-texas-race-conscious-admissions/2015/06/29/5e1a7a30-135b-11e5-89f3-61410da94eb1_story.html  We see the same thing with Asians in Ivy League schools like Harvard who discriminate against them by rejecting them and accepting typically blacks and Hispanics solely due to race and for no other reason. They say "we have a holistic admissions process" which is a bullshit way of saying that "we drink the diversity Kool-Aid even though we can't demonstrate that it benefits any of our students to admit less-qualified college applicants who happen to be non-Asian minorities."     [Hmmm I wonder why that is...lol](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpJlvlhqB64)   Are you a girl if you're transgender? I thought that you can be a girl if you're transsexual since you've taken hormones and other treatments to change your body. Transgender people are just one sex but feel like they're another gender so a boy who feels like a girl who consequently dresses like and/or behaves in a feminine manner. Am I wrong here? Can you be a female when you have a penis but feel like and say to others that you are a girl? Sorry, I'm not well-versed in this trans stuff but I'm curious.    Three blasts of that thing and White Walkers will turn tail and...  RUN TO THE HILLS  RUN FOR THEIR LIVES   I wouldn't. If Hispanics and Latinos want to speak Spanish then they can stay where they came from and speak it there.     We are all from the North American continent.  No we're not.    No they're not.    Zambrano ain't too smart is he? Probably not a straight red but the guy has zero common sense after getting booked. He made Vidal look level-headed for twenty minutes.   Bro, do you even lift?   - Blink-182 and other pop-punk bands. If there was a soundtrack to my childhood then it was filled with Blink-182 songs along with other pop-punk bands like Yellowcard, Green Day, The Offspring, Sum 41, etc. Any time that I hear songs from these bands on the radio or anywhere else I am transported back to my childhood and remember days of running around our neighborhoods playing Cops and Robbers or of days in the Summer spent riding all over town on our bikes or attempting to skateboard in each other's driveways.   - Skateboarding and skateboard fads. Me and my friends were posers but I still loved the Tony Hawk Pro Skater games and wearing all of the crap that I bought at PacSun with my friends. Billabong/Quicksilver shirts with skate shoes, cargo shorts, and a rope or pukka necklace was a must back in those days.   - Recess. So much fun. We and my friends used to play soccer, kickball, basketball, football, or we used to chase the girls around and they would do the same with us. This was the age of cooties so being able to outrun the fairer sex was essential to your survival. Nobody wanted to be a member of the male herd to be culled by a superior female specimen who was capable of running you down and infecting you with her cooties with the touch of a finger.    - Playing video games with friends. Countless nights we would spend over each other's houses playing Playstation, N64, Gameboy, GameCube, XBOX, etc., until we were called home by our parents or we fell asleep. GoldenEye sessions that lasted hours. Pokemon playing on Gameboy that lasted hours. We would play the game and would also trade cards with each other during breaks. TJ is still on my shit list for putting a crease in my holographic Zapdos. Bastard.   - Field trips at school. I was lucky enough to go on plenty of field trips growing up to a number of different places. Me and my classmates went to art museums, the aquarium, the movies, to theme parks, to giant outdoor arboretums and gardens, to wildlife parks, musical concerts, and more. I always looked forward to these because I got to hang out with my friends outside of class and because it gave me a chance of sitting next to girls I liked on the bus on the way to and from the places that we went to. I'll never forget getting to sit next to and talk to Dana on the bus and then during our trip to the art museum out in the countryside in middle school. I can remember that whole day. It was like heaven for me at that age. I barely knew Dana but she was really pretty and nice and we were split up into the same group and walked around with each other the whole day and then talked and played trivia games with our friends at the back of the bus, you know, where all the cool kids sat. I used to listen to a lot of the songs on my NOW compilation CDs and think about Dana. I remember listening to LFO songs all the time while thinking of her. I guess you could say that things got pretty serious.   - Watching cartoons. It's strange to think about just how big a part of life cartoons were and then how they were gone when I got older. I haven't watched a cartoon since I was 14 yet I watched them relentlessly for years. Hey Arnold!, Doug, Angry Beavers, Pokemon, Rugrats, Dragonball-Z, etc., all long gone and out of my life despite being such a big part of growing up. It's bittersweet to try and watch some of the episodes again only to realize that you've seriously outgrown the shows and that they no longer are as captivating as they were many years ago when you were a kid.   - Spending time with friends. We used to be together all of the time during the school year but it was the Summer months that were magical for me and my friends. We would honestly spend just about every waking minute with each other. We would wake up, all go to the pool, spend hours there until dinner time, usually head to each other's houses for dinner, then play outside at night or in each other's basements all night and sleepover each other's houses. We would repeat this routine almost every day of the week. I loved some of the games that we would come up with when we got bored of established games like basketball or whiffle ball. One of my favorites was called "Santa Clause" where one of us had to put on this giant Santa hat over our heads and then come down my friend's basement in the dark where we couldn't see anything. The other guys were down there and had constructed all of these obstacles or boobie traps to screw up the poor friend who had the hat over their head. The way to win was for you to be the last friend hiding who didn't get touched by the guy in the Santa hat. You could hide or beat the crap out of "Santa" with pillows. Many times it was our hysterical laughter that gave away where we were and Santa would lunge at us as and tag us as soon as we gave away our position. Riding bikes, playing tag, swimming at the pool, playing sports, video games, watching movies, watching MTV music videos, and doing other fun stuff with my friends is something I hope that I never forget because those were some of the best days of my life. We were totally carefree, life was so much more innocent and interesting, and it was so much easier to have fun back then. No drama, no egos, no responsibilities. We were all just friends and as we got older things would change and some of us would change and it was bittersweet to lose some friends who you spent the best days of your life with, only to then make new friends who you would make new memories with later.   There are dildos and dildon'ts in life. This kid committed a dildon't.      I can't wait for Rolling Stone magazine to write about this brutal gang rape and display of violent patriarchy. What's that? The students aren't white frat bros of privilege? Haha nevermind! No article is coming!   **PLAYER 2 HAS ENTERED THE GAME!**   Fat Ronaldo is *best* Ronaldo.   Haha it's a great testament to people lacking principles or convictions and flip-flopping after the fact so that they can be on the "right side" of history and make themselves look good.    You forgot the parts where he cheated on the Kennedy and knocked up some abuelita and the part where he groped and sexually harassed a bunch of women. Other than that, he's the bee's knees!  http://articles.latimes.com/2003/oct/02/local/me-women2  http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/celebritology/post/arnold-schwarzenegger-a-history-of-accusations-and-denials/2011/05/17/AF7Clo5G_blog.html  http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/celebritynews/8504550/Arnold-Schwarzneggers-chequered-history-with-women.html  http://www.cbsnews.com/news/arnold-grope-allegations-grow/  http://www.cnn.com/2003/ALLPOLITICS/10/02/recall.schwarzenegger/index.html?_s=PM:ALLPOLITICS  http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-1387007/Arnold-Schwarzenegger-mistress-Gigi-Goyette-claims-just-women.html      dust explosion   no fatalities  So did another one bite the dust or no?

Yes, the mainstream media has totally *pivoted* from the fact that a White supremacist killed some blacks. Yes, our totally right wing media managed to pull one over on everyone by *pivoting* and making it all about the flag. lol wow dude. It totally wasn't the Left in this country and SJWs and black lives matter protesters who made it about systemic racism and the legacy of slavery and the Confederacy. It was totes the GOP or the media pulling our eyes away from the racial killing and towards the flag.   No one pulled anyone's eyes away from the killer. Are you even joking?   I would love for you to show me statistics about just how prevalent the beliefs of White supremacy are in our modern day GOP. Y'know, the GOP whose leaders don't even stand up to Obama when he tries to get 11 million illegal Hispanic immigrants amnesty in this country. McConnell and Boehner did nothing to stop him yet White supremacy is enough of a part of the GOP base that cosmic forces needed to *pivot* away from their "involvement" in the GOP. Funny stuff.

          Julianne Moore in Don Jon. Wtf?         Subscribed.      How did you give him a concussion?  I would love to hear details :)   http://redd.it/37x1ty   What's the one that looks like it has a web over it?   A completely different Mad Max sequel.    I guess we will be seeing a sequel. Bring it on.  Although I hope Miller does something completely different.         I think they can pull it off.   For future reference, Channing Tatum is not listed as part of the cast anymore for Tarantino's the Hateful Eight. He was a few months ago but his name has been removed from IMBD and Wikipedia.    Pulp Fiction.   Forrest Gump.   Jake Gyllenhaal.   Cinematographer?   That is strange. I just looked on wikipedia and his name isn't there anymore as well.               I tweeted the founder of bloodydisgusting.com he said they are seeking a new director, news by july hopefully.      Maybe I've mixed up iffy writing with iffy line delivery. Some of the lines just feel a little ham-fisted at times.    What is his twitter?   The writing can be a bit iffy sometimes but overall I think it's a great western-drama. It's one of those films where the supporting actor is way better than the lead. Casey Affleck in this film is something to behold, his acting was far ahead of Brad Pitt's, and that doesn't happen very often.   What are your thoughts?   It's from MTV's reboot show. It looks like a mannequin about to perform fellatio.      It's for iOS guys....   Does anyone know if there will be any vehicles in F4?  I saw the flying heli-carrier type thing in the trailer, I'm not sure if that counts as a useable vehicle. So yeah is does anyone know?  Edit: I don't them as /u/Herdnerfer mentioned.    Did I just....fucking read that right?   Leo DiCaprio and M...Michael....Bay....teaming up...  Well, in that case, [I'm fucking out of here, cya'll later!](http://www.reactiongifs.com/r/lftoff.gif)  Edit: I know that Leo is not starring nor Bay directing, this still comes as a shock.   That is quite a nice poster.  This is guaranteed to get nominated for some Oscars.   Except that poster is creepy...   All good, thank you anyway!   All good, thank you anyway!   Love if someone could take me on a step by step guide on how to jailbreak my iPod 5th Gen. Also if they could tell me what the risks and benefits are.  This would be greatly appreciated :)  iOS: 8.2 (Haven't updated to new one yet)   I found a thread for Apple users.  http://www.reddit.com/r/Fallout/comments/22kn5p/trying_to_make_my_iphone_into_a_pipboy/      It's kind of a funny story?   Yep, I'm done here.  Go fuck yourself reddit.   Girl interrupted perhaps?    Holy shit that sounds creepy as fuck. Imma go look for it!   Fallout 4, M:I 5, Everest, Macbeth, Cartel Land. Oscar season is certainly heating up. (excluding Fallout 4 of course.)   So many trailers right now!  Honestly though, this looks fucking insane!      So many trailers lately! I love it!   Fallout is not about the graphics. If you ask me, giving a Fallout game Battlefront 3 graphics will just ultimately ruin the experience.   Thank you The Social Network. Thank you thank you.   Decade defining films. For example, for the 1970s your choice could be Apocalypse Now, 80s it could be Terminator etc, etc.  Also, what film do you think defines this current decade?   There's absolutely nothing like this for Apple?   I just downloaded the one from the website :/  Thank you for this.   I pretty sure every gamer on the internet has lol.      I hope this tops Ghost Protocol.         Front page of r/movies         I think that all the time ahaha. I see something really neat, and I think, they'll all be gone in a couple of months. I saw some Jurassic Park posters the other day, they'll disappear soon.   Wireless Keyboard. I haven't read that one, any good?   Pennywise is a monster. Although I see what you mean.     Bah.  *What?* Hahahaha.   Where!?   You have no idea what you've conjured. You should probably delete this, before [they](https://www.reddit.com/r/moviescirclejerk) find this.   The guy at the top left:  ".......FUCK"      /r/rekt            This isn't Fincher...   That looks pretty intriguing.   Although it'll probably end with the wife jamming the baby down the toaster or some crazy shit.   Amy Pascal and Scott Rudin are up there, along with Kevin Feige.   But for most powerful I would have to say Harvey Weinstien.   wow! listen, I would like to become a cinematographer. I was wondering, could you help me out?   What are you expecting? What do you want to see in this season?   Now I know someone is guaranteed to comment Every Fram a Painting, I already know and love that channel.   But yeah any channels that look at/analyze cinematography in film would be greatly appreciated.   Why can't all action films be like this?  Fuck shaky cam.      Damn, knew I forgot one.      Opening scene to Zodiac stays with me every time I watch it.  Opening to The Social Network is brilliant.  Drive.   Apocalypse Now of course.  The Godfather (Duh)  The Dark Knight  Heat.  The Town.  Schindler's List.  Saving Private Ryan.  Inception.  Pulp Fiction  Inglorious Basterds  Watchmen  Zombieland.   **City of God**  Knew nothing about it, completely blew me away.          It fits perfectly.             Yeah sure.   *Insight   Such bullshit :/   Details in description: http://redd.it/37x1ty   Are you aware of the IT remake?      Driving.  Kill Billing.       Now that would be wicked.   As you can all see I am no writer. Within the DCCU, we have Batman v Superman, Suicide Squad and Justice League Parts 1   2 all staring Ben Affleck as Batman. DC have also announced that they are making a single stand alone Batman film JUST about Batman (obviously there will be supporting characters within) whereas Suicide Squad, Justice League and BvS are all feature Affleck's Batman as a supporting character.  In this discussion I just wanted to ask everyone what they would like to see in this stand alone Batman film, what villains they would like to see etc.   I'm getting a serious 'Blood Diamond' vibe from this.   They've launched a new universe with Ben Affleck as Batman. The Dark Knight Trilogy were their own thing. But yeah this new universe is more true to the comics. So they've got a whole new cast for DC characters. These include Henry Cavill as Superman, Jared Leto as the Joker, Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn etc.   What are your thoughts on the standalone batman film DC are yet to make? What kind of film would you like to see with what villains etc?   squeal like anime school girls.  O_O   When you've seen all of them...      Collections aren't allowed :/      Aha I know right.      When Deakins was announced to lense BR sequel my life automatically completed itself.    Any insult from [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSEYXWmEse8) video, a youtube classic.   That does count.      Maybe. If Scorsese ever returns to the gangster genre one last time, it is quite possible.   Black Mass and Legend both look like promising gangster films.     Please include the name of the film and the cinematographer.  Please one still per user.  I'll announce the winner one week from now, so that gives everyone plenty of time to decide and post.  The still can be from any film whatsoever. Think long and hard about what still you want to post, remember it has to be truly breathtaking on both a technical and storytelling level!  If you have any further questions, please comment or PM me.  Good luck and think hard!  Edit: This submissions just keep getting better and better! I'll give you guys a hint: I'm a BIG fan of Roger Deakins...   Edit: And the winner is...../u/gundamgirl for [this](http://i.imgur.com/XqK5GLj.jpg) shot from THE FALL. Thank you for all of your awesome submissions, It was extremely hard to choose!   (sorry for the late announcement guys, I could've sworn I posted this on a wednesday...)   We have much in common, my friend.   What are they and what are you expecting?   Hey David! Kung Fury is a spectacular piece of work, I love it!  My question is, what was the biggest challenge about making Kung Fury.   You got to...work with....Deakins?         Brilliance.   /r/TrueFilm will help you out more and in much greater detail.

 Uber is also free until the 20th. And quite cheap overall   WooHoo for communism.   Who hasn't been there before?    Jackson is Bucky's closer      I am currently student teaching and had a really shit day today. This quote genuinely bettered my day. Push on indeed President Coolidge.      Yeah, but you give no explanation that's why you are getting downvoted. Not for a dissenting opinion   Like Ohio State in Columbus?    Wow. That website rocks.   There is no chance they keep Freeman, with or without Norv. They will keep Cassel as a vet, if anyone, and draft qb in 1st or 2nd.   No longer spies, find cocaine. Now drug cartel.   The title didn't tip you off on the swap?   I imagine the equivalent of the Amsterdam coffee shops will begin opening up at some point. Seems only logical, no?   No offense, but your comment comes off as ignorant as shit. I assume you are white? You clearly don't understand the unequal job opportunities of African Americans in ANY profession, let alone head coaching in the NFL. How many black head coaches were there prior to this rule?? It clearly is working as they are now actually seeing opportunities. It's not forcing any team to hire these individuals. Its forcing teams to actually give them a look.   Its not like you can just "get rid of the Rooney Rule."  Racism isn't dead, and old white owners usually need to be pushed in the right direction. Sorry, for this mini-rant, it just really pisses me off when people are ignorant of the incredible struggle for equality that is still being fought for by African American coaches.   Maybe pick up something from Milwaukee Brewing Company. Local, very city orientated. Or hit up Great Lakes Distillery for some great local booze that may not be available up in Appleton.    Understandable. They are quick reads. The dunk and eggs are only 50-70 pages   If you still are feeling the itch, there is also the Dunk and Egg novellas as well as The Princess and the Queen. All in the Westeros world. Fantastic reads.   They do have the mysterious dragon horn. Really that is what got there interest directed at the dragon        	21
 Does smith like rondo more than howard?   McDonalds double hamburgers when I need some pick me up calories. Decent enough. At chipolte double chicken bowl, extra black beans, easy on the rice + grilled veggies and salsa and side of guac = macro heaven.    I didn't hate it, especially because we had fun teams who were easy to root for (except Kevin Martin).    It doesn't work like that. You can't trade for a player just to flip him. Pretty sure he's locked in till after the season or for a year.    Holy shit you're obnoxious. Do yourself a favor and re-read all your replies tomorrow when you get a chance to cool off a little.    Found the nerd.    That's what I immediatly heard.    Haha I wanted a z4 for like 10 years after watching it.   Yeah I was also not into Wondrous that much. Liked Mute and that's about it.    That's one of my favorites as well. I really liked Dalton as Bond. Him and Craig portray/ed a fairly similar Bond.  Golden Eye is probably my favorite though because it was the first one I saw and I got to see it in theaters as a 7 year old. Still remember my dad jokingly covering my eyes during the sexual scenes with Xenia.    What did you think of Youth Lagoon? I credit 'The Year of Hibernation' as the catalyst for a lot of the good things that have happened in my life over the past 2 years. I was, almost exclusively, spurred into going to Outside Lands in San Francisco last August to see YL. I thought the show was great (as was the whole festival) and that trip ended up leading to an amazing group of friends, a deconstruction of my previously self-destructive social/general anxiety, and lots of fun in between.  ------------  *When I was seventeen,*  *my mother said to me*  ***"Don't stop imagining. The day that you do is the day that you die."***  *Now I pull a one ton carriage,*  *instead of the horses grazing the lawn.*  *And I was having fun.*  *We were all having fun.*    Was kind of disappointed in this version. I like the pace of that live performance a lot more and think it fits better with the song/lyrics.   Saw them a few weeks ago in Houston. Good stuff.      I bet you can.    Not that it does but that could mean that a movie with 99% on RT with 100 reviews could have 99 who think it's the best movie ever and one who doesn't like it and a movie with 100% could have 100 reviewers who just liked it enough to give a positive review.    I'm pretty sure that's not Jeff (the guy behind the costume). Unless he's changed A LOT since I talked to him at the end of last season.    That's not Clutch. Jeff is way skinnier than that guy.    Earlier you said you were a practicing cat psychic though.    It's actually the same size as it would be at any distance.    Talking about the distance at which you saw it.    If you're *sure* it was hunting something else, why did you say it was hunting/stalking yall? Could have had a prett freaking great story but You had to go and get self conscious and sensationalize the events in question.    These are shit.    You also described it as 'big and scary', which would not be the case at a quarter mile.    He noticed a mountain lion stalking Yall at 1300 feet? Worst mountain lion ever or is your uncle the greatest Hunter ever or are you the biggest exaggerator ever of all time times a billion quadrillion?   something like 1/4 mile away  You realize that's like 1300 feet, right? You wouldn't know a mountain lion was 130 feet away, let alone 1300.    shoot. thanks.   It's December, right?   The definition of 'beast' is "an animal, especially a large or dangerous four footed one".   This is true but we did have Steve Novak.   Cool. Guess I'm just a boring person. Enjoy being a fun person.    Why are they 4 and 10 respectively? Just curious why he would be ranked higher when they are on the floor together.   San Antonio has fields. Cool. Sorry for finding the city boring. I'm sure a lot of people find Houston boring. I don't take it personally.   to the flash point a few months ago when a white hispanic guy on neighborhood watch shot an unarmed black teenager he thought was scary.  that was actually 2 years ago  not to discredit the rest of your post or anything.   I "hate" San Antonio because it's boring as fuck and hating other big cities in Texas comes with the territory of living in a big city in Texas. San Antonio has 50% hispanic population verse 43% in Houston so there are a lot more Mexicans in Houston than San Antonio as well. But yeah it's because us white folks are scared of the brown invasion.   Not sure about Episcopal but St. Thomas Episcopal has a very good one.    You should contact St. John's school and St. Thomas Episcopal School, they both have very good bag pipe programs and I'm sure you could find someone to help.    Lemme guess, you're mexican?   He's got like 5 years left in the tank. Prob less after all this stress.    You two should build a time machine and go back into the past where films *were held to a higher standard* and then jerk each other off with the tears from all the laughter.    You basically called me Toby.    Sure, if you were white.    Why? If you think the Bible Belt is the worst place to be an atheist you're not smart.    The only way you could know if she never once looked up at the stage was if you never once took your eyes off of her.    Clever? Sure. Ingenious? Naw.    People don't get legally executed in the bible belt for being atheists, so no it's probably not the worst place to be an atheist.    lol you talk like its some kind of rule or you know enough high level drug dealers to make an educated statement on the matter.    Which probably leads to all the crazy - specifically Japanese - kink porn bred out of a repressed sexual society.    You know a lot about smash.    If you literally hate *people*, like in general, they probably did raise you wrong.    Seems like an easy fix to that would be that the longer the wineup, the higher the priority.   My only let down with this movie was that one of them didn't wear the Minotaur costume at the last battle. One of my favs though.    Sorry. I'll be more tactful.  At a gas station buy water, mineral water or unsweet tea for a drink and almonds or peanuts or jerky (careful as some have a lot of added sugar but it's easy to find some with minimal - which isn't a bad thing) as a snack.  You're right, it's not easy but it is simple. You just have to adjust the way you approach purchasing food. I was in the same boat and felt the same way you do, but with a little bit of foresight and willpower, it's easy to not consume heavily processed junk food. Buy fruits at the grocery store, take them with you. Buy frozen fruit (i prefer raspberries which are very low in sugar and blueberries) and [edemame](http://www.seapointfarms.com/new_products_pages/lightly-salted.html) for quick and easy snacks that are high in fiber, protein and vitamins.  Drink hot tea or black coffee. Buy chicken breast (bags of frozen chicken breasts are cheap, healthy and easy to work with). Buy seasonal vegetables. Canned tuna is extremely healthy, make a tuna salad with 0% greek yogurt, celery, and whatever else you like in it. If you have to have bread/pastas buy whole wheat with the least amount of sugars (though those carbs are broken down to sugar so even 'sugar free' bread technically has sugars).  Get a crock pot, make stews with lots of vegetables and some meat. Lentils, quinoa, black beans are great sources of fiber and protein, are cheap and are filling.  You'll find it gets easier and easier to adjust your eating and buying habits the further along you go. I consume very little food which has added sugar and it just takes a little bit of self control to get there.  Good luck and sorry if I was an asshole earlier, just trying to help out.  Lost about 80 pounds the past 18 months by adjusting my habits. Cutting out that (excess) sugar is so worth it and I hope you manage to make it a reality.          Hey Yao!  First I just wanted to say that I'm a huge Rockets fan and you and T-Mac were my favorite players of the 00s. It was truly a privilege watching you play, laugh, joke and be an ambassador for the sport of basketball and for your home country of China.  I've got a question about basketball and a question about your humanitarian work, I'll start with basketball.  What was your favorite moment from your career on the Rockets? My greatest memory was the playoff game against the Lakers were you went to the locker room with an apparent injury, only to emerge a bit later in the game to lead your team to the win in LA.  You've already had a successful public campaign against the consumption of shark fin, and now what will surely be a successful campaign in Africa. What will be the next big project you tackle? Will you follow in the trend of a humane approach to animal protection or do you see yourself shifting towards other projects and problems? Also, would you ever consider teaming up with Deke as two towers of humanitarian work?  Thanks for using your global appeal to change the world for the better. We need more people like you out there that aren't afraid to use their fame, stature and respect to change the world for the better and it was an absolute privileged watching you play basketball.     Stop fucking shopping at convenience stores. Buy food that isn't in packages. Drink liquids that don't have sugar. It's essy, you're just conditioned to think otherwise because you don't know how to shop. There are so many options, but if you expect to eat what you were eating before just minus sugar yeah you're gonna have a problem.   Brodhisattvas   I also found out it is extremely hard to find stuff WITHOUT sugar(or sugar substitute) in America.  It's really not though. Like at all. It's actually pretty easy.   Me when your mom asks wants if I want seconds.   Lake Placid   well here is the city of houston boundary: http://imgur.com/0yQKaC8  thought maybe he rotated at first but that doesn't even line up. not sure where his base came from.  e: the little bunny looks like the top right isolated boundary but it's mirrored.      nice   Should change it to Hareston so you keep the H.   I do, I think what I proposed is the best course of action in his situation.   Cool I guess we have different memories or something.    Haha fair enough. Rough stuff if you didn't even notice a rib injury! Gotten a bruised rib once and it was one of the most lingering painful injuries I've had.    Bruised ribs are fucking awful. And the worst part is everything is so much funnier with a bruised rib. Cruel joke.    I know. Just don't remember 'We did it Reddit' until Boston.    Sounds about right.   Meh   Has it? I only remember it entering the popular lexicon of reddit after the Boston bomber fiasco.    God damn you sound like a straight up cunt.    Post about it to /r/nosleep with perfect grammar and incredible narrative. I know that's what id do after losing my whole family.    You would have known if you had a broken or cracked rib.    Just curious. Was asking him but everyone else and their mother seemed to feel obligated to chime in on the matter.   You asked for the logic behind it.    And about as much as that comment? Congrats.    There weren't subdeddits 8 years ago.    Just curious, but why have an account if you contribute so little?   Ah, there it is.   Same to you guys! Can't wait for Saturday. Should be a great game.   If we still had Asik we wouldn't have Ariza/Terry/Papanikalou.  I think we're better off.      meatballs killed my toilet this morning   You felt like a Bench   Terry had a great game.    Hey do you think I can get a personal reply?  Cheers,  Michael Ainsworth   Oh, my bad. I thought I was talking to children.    Coo   Why? Why is there more value in a true story than a fictional one? This isn't a thing that the truth makes more valuable.    I'm gonna use kerfuffle today. Thanks. Forgot about that word.   Protests.  The Arab Spring were protests yall.  The Arab Spring led to fall of numerous Arab governments. They weren't simply protests.  Occupy NY, those were protests.    You people seriously need to get the fuck off reddit and reevaluate yalls lives.    Why? I liked Gaurdians of the Galaxy and the fact that it didn't happen doesn't change that. Why is the truth so important for a subreddit like /r/tifu? I'd rather have fake, well written stories than real, poorly written ones.  But I guess we're the vanguards of truth up in here.    Why the hell do you people whine about something that isn't real, that doesn't do anything, that you supposedly don't care about.... unless someone else gets it?  Like seeiously, take the day to reevaluate your priorities.    Why the fuck can't we just enjoy things without worrying whether or not it's true? Jesus Christ, you aren't a fucking detective. Just enjoy, it was a good story and was well written. Yet you whine that it's not "true" enough for your standards.   This bullshit ruins posts. Him writing a fictional story didn't ruin the post, your need for whatever the fuck you're looking for when you go detective mode ruins the post. Why the hell can't you people just suspend reality for 2 seconds, read the story, react to it and move on. You don't have to treat it like the gospel.  Yeesh.    He wouldn't, sista-bear.    One thing is for sure; this has been a great start to the season for the Rockets to pad their "pretty much meaningless historical comparisons stats".   I'd really love a chance to play yall in the playoffs, it would be a great series. Pretty sure heading into this season we're tied up in our franchises head to head play.    Work put him up? Use your imagination.     It's been a week. Yall will come back after everyone's healthy and contend.    Yeah, but you can't value a player based on his team.  Eh, I disagree man. Morey matches that offer sheet if Bosh had signed with us. The market dictated his value so high because team(s) were willing to overpay based on their teams contract situations (Rockets w/ being able to sign RFA over the cap   Mavs w/ Dirk taking a major paycut).  I do however think this was a very unique situation which we won't see again for a long time.  And agreed that he'll be impossible to trade if they ever want to.    I'm not even talking about stats; Parsons had 29 last night. I'm talking about cohesion, chemistry and their complimentary skill sets. This year's team hums like a machine whereas last year's squad seemed to step on each other's toes frequently which would grind the train to a stop. Harden/Lin/Parsons all had similar offensive repoitoires which would create knots in the offense. Now Harden has free reign of the mid range, and shooters on the wings. You know, in theory.    Oh god I'm getting giddy just thinking about reddit's reaction to a Heat/Rockets finals. Two most hated teams past couple years. This feels like a great partnership in evil.    see: the 2008 houston rockets   The only thing glue and Parsons have in common is their pigmentation.   I think Parsons has more value as an individual player but Ariza is a better player when you have elite interior and perimeter players.   I guess where I'm coming from is a heads up basis. If I had to choose between Ariza and Parsons to build a team around, I'd take Parsons every day. When the team they're put on+their salary are taken into consideration, Ariza is by far the better option .  	107
  Actually, Marx said socialism is the political stage before Communism. In socialism the government controls the means of production and distribution. The word control does not just mean outright ownership. Control can mean the government allows  private ownership of business or industries but that it controls how ownership makes decisions, production, access to raw materials, distribution channels etc etc etc    Actually, Marx said socialism is the political stage before Communism.

Actually the Nazis were socialists (edit note: it amazes me how many uneducated people are down voting this comment.  Yes, I know you were told the Nazis were right wing but that refers to the socialist political spectrum not the entire political spectrum)         Naziism was a socialist political movement. The Nazis, AKA the National Socialist German Workers Party, believed in government control over the means of production and distribution and a government centric society at the expense of individual liberty. Hitler was a devout socialist leader and writer. He felt that standard socialism was too slow and he  felt Naziism offered a better socialist path. He disliked communists because he felt they were too internationally focused and that they contained too many Jewish members.   Hitler was a true socialist as was Mussolini. They were certainly not Communists. Socialism works on paper but always fails in real life. The reason? Because ultimately, the government (acting in proxy for the community) must use force to compel the people to comply. It is at that point that all socialist societies resort to violence to force the people to obey.   The US has killed many during its history and yes some of those people have been innocents. But you simply can't compare what the US has done in its history with what socialist regimes have done in their histories. The US have killed mostly combatants that were actively trying to kill Americans. Did Pol Pot do the same? Mao? Hitler? Stalin? Tito? Ceauescu?  No, the difference is that those regimes used violence to compel civilians to obey. They used murder, starvation, secret police, active campaigns to force compliance to official policy.         It shouldn't be but sadly it is. Whenever an issue becomes politicized, facts become scarce         What about the socialist regimes that have led to 100 million deaths? Remember Pol Pot, the Soviets, Cubans, China, Nazis, Fascists? What about them? Also did you know that the Scandinavian countries practice socialism lite, rich, homogenous, the US pays for it's military protection? What will happen to those countries once immigrants from the middle east overwhelm their social safety nets?   Socialism is cancer to a nation. Eliminating Leftist policies are the best thing any country can do to push themselves forward   Liberal Hollywood types back far Left political issue. What courage!   Lets hope some advanced alien race doesn't find her, re-animate her, give her super powers, and send her back to earth for revenge                           The cops riddled the car they were traveling in with bullets. They wanted to make sure the couple would not escape again. Both Bonnie and Clyde had multiple head shots.       It's like having sex with the ugliest Playboy Playmate of the year ever    Obama   Say that the Nazis and the Fascists were socialists. Although both are historical facts, the uneducated of reddit will down vote that comment because  ideological purity is more important than reality.                                                                                                                                              Censorship sucks                           Marx said that socialism required government control over the means of production. That may or may not mean outright ownership of a company or industry by the government. It can also mean the fovernment allows a company or industry to remain in private hands but falls under srtict governments control.  With regard to the Nazis, the government allowed many armament  companies to remain in private hands but it kept strict control over the companies' decision making on out puts, pricing, and access to raw materials. Examples include Krupps, volkswagen, Mercedes Benz, focker, mauser etc etc etc   Yawn. Considering your lack of education, maybe you should stick to commenting on r/videogames. I am so tired of uneducated high school teens debating factual issues with their simplistic opinions. Facts are facts. No  matter how much they conflict with your juvenile worldview they still stubbornly exist.     I suggest you request a refund from the "college" you attended. Personally, I doubt you even graduated from high school. Telling me to fuck off, that's great. Did you learn that debating strategy from the debating team at the "college" you attended?    I am curious, what level of education have you achieved? I ask because discussing the subject of socialism with you is like discussing the subject of religion with a Pentecostal bible thumper. You have a set, faith based view of the world. Facts, logic, and history are meaningless to you. I suggest you open a book or do your own research to learn basic historical facts that anyone who has taken a 200 level college political science class would readily know. Good luck     At the turn of the 20th century in Germany, many political philosophers took the core elements of socialism and added their own elements to it in an attempt to improve on the basic socialist model. Hitler did not like Communism because it was internationally focused and had too many Jews as members. Hence he developed his brand of socialism called National Socialism. Others created their own brands of socialism. These improved systems still retained their classical socialist elements.   It was Marx who said that political systems were on a continuum with societies starting as agrarian, then capitalist, then socialist, and finally communist. That was Marx who said that. He stated that during the transitional phase known as socialism, government would control the means of production. That may mean ownership or it may mean coercion or legislative control over formerly private industries. Ever hear of Obamacare? The government does not own the industry but it controls it.   Your opinions on what socialism means to you is interesting but they are not the definitions that Marx or any other socialist agrees with. I simply don't know why you are having so much trouble understanding what socialism is. I highly suggest that rather than simply guessing, you should actually study the history of socialism.      "improved socialist systems"  All that means is at the turn of the 20th century in Germany, many political philosophers took the core elements of socialism and added their own elements to it in an attempt to improve on the basic socialist model. Hitler did not like Communism because it was internationally focused and had too many Jews as members. Hence he developed his brand of socialism called National Socialism.

I simply don't know why you are having so much trouble understanding what socialism is. I highly suggest that rather than simply guessing, you should actually study the history of socialism.      The nazis were socialists because they were the National Socialist German Workers Party.  Their core beliefs were a government centeic society at the expence of personal liberty. They practiced in governmemt  comtrol over the means of production and distribution. Hitler was a long time socialist writer and philosopher  who envisioned Naziism as a fairer and faster form of socialism.    Naziism was a form of socialism. I can't  debate such an obvious historical fact. Please brush up on the subject so you can debate  intelligently in the future. Btw what level of educarion have you  achieved? Just curious   Marx said in communism, ownership of the means of production by the community is necessary but in socialism, the step before communism, control over the means of production is allowed and even useful  as a neccesarry transitional state. I really wish you had a greater basic knowledge of Marx and his theories. It also puzzles me how you assume your views are infallable . You are simple wrong here. Don't take it personally. The facts are the facts   The nazis were socialists. We really cant debate that point. You really need to study the socialist movents in Germany during the early 20th century. It is facinating how ao many tried to take the core elements of socialism and try to improve on them to make socialism better, faster, and fairer.  Naziism and Fascism were two such attempts.    Care to refute my facts?  Or are you only interested in silly snark?    Sorry but you need take some college level poly sci courses.  If you have already done so demand a refund. The Nazis and the Fascists were both socialist movements. Socialism requires  control over the means of production and distribution.  That does not equal ownership of industries, merely control. I suggest  you study the socialist movements of the early 20th century. It is a facinating field that explains how many took the core elements of socialism and tried to create a better, faster, fairer socialist system. The nazis and fascists were two such improved socialist systems. Rather than just claiming these facts are not so, why not put that effort into actually learning  about socialism. Good luck     The nazis were socialists as were the  Italian  fascists. Have you ever taken a college level political science  class?    Hitler was a devout socialist.  Naziism was a form of socialism. You are confusing the fact that the soviets considered  them right wing. They were on the right side of the socialist political spectrum but they are on the far left of the whole political spectrum. Socialism is classified as a government  or community  centric political system that controls the means of production and distribution. That defines the nazis. Naziism took socialism and added antisemitetism to it.    Why is that? Are you pro Nazi and pro socialist?   I was making the point that it is a good thing when Naziism, which is a form of socialism fails. Naziism is a bad system. Do you disagree with that?    funny!   Baby on board placards were created to alert rescuers after a car accident that a small baby may be hidden in the wreckage. It was never designed, nor is it effective in increasing other driver's consideration of you as a driver with a child in your car.    Socialism fails once again.                                                    This is Reddit, where socialism is only religion allowed. Any alternative political opinions will be rejected as blasphemy and result in condemnation of the person as being a troll or a racist.                                                                                                   zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz boring   Blah blah blah. You are simply parroting things you have heard and don't understand.    I asked you a scientific question  and you can't  answer it. No matter how you avoid it that is proof you know nothing about acience.  Maybe stick to subreddits like r/spongebob?   That cloud looks just like a mountain!    The main problem is the rate of the change. In the past, nature has always been able to adapt to natural changes slowly over time.   Earth's temperatures vary widely by season. In the space a a few months, temps can go from 100F in summer to -50 below zero in the same location. The rate of temps rising in the last century is well within the normal fluctuations observed throughout earth's history. Earth's temps are cyclical and complex. Solar activity, volcanic activity, ocean activity all impact earth's climate. What make you think that the proposed solutions, raising taxes and empowering elites, will have any impact on the climate at all?    You are obviously not a person versed in science. Maybe you shouldn't discuss climate change?     There are no correct or normal variables for these questions, there are only correct parameters within which mankind can remain prosperous  Can you say what those parameters are? I ask because a .7 degree rise in temps over the past century is hardly a reason for concern or to spend billions needlessly.       I accept your admission of defeat. Either you can answer my questions with actual science or you can't. You can't. Good luck at Ringling Bros   I am still waiting for you to answer my questions. Until you do, then get a job at a carnival.   Any clown can make silly claims.   You lost a debate on climate change because I had the science to prove my case. Now all you have is snark. In the end, I would rather Be the scientist than the silly jester.     I used science and you used religion and I defeated you. Science....deal with it...   You were beaten by a smarter, better person today. Nothing to be ashamed of. I'm sure your religion is important to you.   I hope you realize that a climate change skeptic debated you today and kicked your butt. Victory is indeed sweet!                     Yup, I thought so. You can't answer the question. That means your position is not science. Your position is political, philosophical, or religious. Praise Gaia!   If you can't establish what temperatures and CO2 levels are needed to save the planet then your argument is non scientific. Think about it....   Lets stick to facts:  If climate change is indeed a scientifically based problem, then you must be able to establish a factual baseline for which all measurements of possible damage and solutions can be based.  What are the correct and normal atmospheric temperature(s) for Earth?  What are the correct and normal ocean temperature(s) for Earth?  What is the correct and normal CO2 level for Earth?  If you (or anyone else) cannot answer these questions then the issue of the dangers of climate change is not scientifically based and therefor is either politically, philosophically, or religiously based    but temps are still rising at a rate of 0.05C/yr.  That figure is well within the margin of error. Translation: not a reliable or provable fact.  Lets stick to facts:  If climate change is indeed a scientifically based problem, then you must be able to establish a factual baseline for which all measurements of possible damage and solutions  can be based.  What are the correct and normal atmospheric temperature(s) for Earth?   What are the correct and normal ocean temperature(s) for Earth?   What is the correct and normal CO2 level for Earth?   If you (or anyone else) cannot answer these questions then the issue of the dangers of climate change is not scientifically based and therefor is either politically, philosophically, or religiously based   Rather than merely claiming my sources are compromised, can you point out which of their claims are factually incorrect? Has there or has there not been an 18 year pause in rising temps? Have all climate change models predicting fast rises of temps been wrong or correct? Have temp reading been enhanced rather than simply reported? Have climate change proponents emails admitted lies, changed data, and an organized campaign of retribution against anyone who opposed them?  Can you deny that Leftist politics has seriously influenced climate science?  Can you deny that major climate change proponents have lied, changed data, are influenced by politics, or are influenced by grant money?                  The 97% of scientists agree that anthropogenic climate change is occurring claim has been thoroughly debunked.  http://www.thegwpf.org/new-paper-the-97-consensus-and-its-critics/  http://www.thegwpf.org/content/uploads/2014/09/Warming-consensus-and-it-critics1.pdf  The 97% claim is based on a study by John Cook. His emails on the study are revealing:  "Its essential that the public understands that theres a scientific consensus on AGW. So [Skeptical Science activists] Jim Powell, Dana [Nucitelli] and I have been working on something over the last few months that we hope will have a game changing impact on the public perception of consensus. Basically, we hope to establish that not only is there a consensus, there is a strengthening consensus." -John Cook  Two things are immediately apparent from this email: Cook had decided even before he began his investigations what those investigations would reveal.    This was always going to be a PR exercise, not a scientific one.       Cook's own emails further destroy any credibility in the 97% figure be showing his intentionally misleading methodology:  "Okay, so weve ruled out a definition of AGW being any amount of human influence or more than 50 percent human influence. Were basically going with Aris porno approach (I probably should stop calling it that) which is AGW = humans are causing global warming. e.g.  no specific quantification which is the only way we can do it considering the breadth of papers were surveying." -John Cook  But Cooks 97 percent consensus claim was rebutted in subsequent analyses of his study. A paper by five leading climatologists published in the journal Science and Education last year found that Cooks study misrepresented the views of most consensus scientists.  The definition Cook used to get his consensus was weak, the climatologists said. Only 41 out of the 11,944 published climate studies examined by Cook explicitly stated that mankind caused most of the warming since 1950 meaning the actual consensus is 0.3 percent.    The climate systems, ocean systems, solar activity, and all other factors that effect Earth's climate are very complex.   The fact that all models predicting temperature rises have been woefully wrong compared to actual data proves this.    http://www.drroyspencer.com/2013/06/still-epic-fail-73-climate-models-vs-measurements-running-5-year-means/  The 97% of scientists agree that anthropogenic climate change is occurring claim has been thoroughly debunked.    http://www.thegwpf.org/new-paper-the-97-consensus-and-its-critics/  http://www.thegwpf.org/content/uploads/2014/09/Warming-consensus-and-it-critics1.pdf  The 97% claim is based on a study by John Cook.

This graph proves there has indeed been a pause in global temperatures for 18 years and running:  http://www.climatedepot.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/1711years.png  The data for the graph above is from RSS satellite.  You said:  There is no ideal temperature for Earth  there is no constant to provide as an answer, CO2 levels are always changing  So how do we know that the current (or future)  temp and CO2 levels are bad? Doesn't that defeat your entire premise?       Let me see your cites professor   So you agree then that there is no scientific significance to the term consensus. Our understanding of any scientific field of study, at any given time,   is but a point on a moving continuum. We should never simply conclude that we know enough and quit a scientific field.    First of all, that 97% of scientists figure has been thoroughly debunked. That survey was made of a hundred odd scientists, the vast majority of which were not climatologists.   If we understand the climate systems involved as you claim, can you explain:  The 18 year pause in temperature increase?   Why every climate model has been incorrect?  What the best temperature for Earth should be?  What the best CO2 level for Earth should be?     There is no such determination. Ever hear of the Scientific Method?    The climate always changes. The question is whether man is contributing to an increase in temperatures that is disastrously harmful.       It's a fake issue designed to increase taxes and empower elites.                pic of stickers http://i.imgur.com/WqKvNma.jpg?1           	199
 Here's the original article (through 2 links, the article above cites another news article)  http://www.nature.com/ncomms/2015/150422/ncomms7984/full/ncomms7984.html   Maybe, organs have to be healthy, and people have to die. We're getting good at preventing death while not being healthy.   TBH, every time I've had to go to get a new driver's license since I turned 18 (so twice now...AZ licenses expire when you turn 65), I've been verbally asked if I would like to be a donor (which of course, is yes). I'd be interested in seeing how many organ donors there are in developed nations to put this type of "we need an opt out system" in perspective.   I think some people may have religious qualms. Such as: keeping the body together after death (putting them in an urn is considered together). I remember hearing that spreading your ashes across some space (ocean, space, etc) was not considered a Catholic burial in high school   In all likelihood this study was funded before the original paper had been debunked and thus the money was already "spent." While unfortunate that funds are allocated this way, it does help maintain normalcy.   I get shocked a lot, despite moving to a much more humid climate   Having been shocked by 1200V and 15kV sources (separately) that run in the microamp range, you'll fucking feel it, for hours. Just an odd tingling sensation after the initial "Oh fuck that hurts!" as it's burning you goes away.   That was going to be my exact comment.   Honestly, I can never get through all those carrots (seriously, most other things I can). Maybe this would allow them to sell in smaller quantities so I don't waste it   How does this help with produce?   Usually the factored in cost here, with regard to human cost, is [quality adjusted life years](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality-adjusted_life_year). At least that's according to those in public health, so who knows if they have people's best interest in mind?/s   So I had the same adviser for undergrad and graduate school and went straight through to get my PhD in Biosystems Engineering. In undergrad I told him I wanted to get a PhD and was open to both options. When I got into grad school I told him that I was more interested in working in industry. We worked a lot with industry. In fact, they were our primary funding source for most, if not all, the time I was in grad school.  He always tried to steer me a bit towards academia, but I always told him, and my committee, that I was more interested in industry. We actually spent a fair amount of time talking about it, which was very valuable. One of my professors spent a large portion of his career in industry and then moved back to academia when he was older and I'd say he's one of the better professors for having that experience.  One thing to keep in mind is that while publications don't necessarily matter in industry, getting them in grad school does matter to industry (if that's the track you take. I had a friend to an MS in aerospace that never published and it was totally fine because he did a big design project or something). The thing is, it's a good experience, IMO, to have some less than random person who is supposed to be anonymous rip through something you've worked on for months-years in an attempt to make it better.  Now, when it came time to graduate last August, you can bet your ass I was looking at Academic Keys for a PostDoc position as much as I was looking for a job through Indeed.com, BMES, etc. I ended up getting a research/development job in industry that, so far, has turned out quite well. Everyone told me "Remember where you came from," when I told them (I also moved 1800 miles), but also congratulations. I think being open with them about what you hope to do is going to benefit you because if the professor(s) have been around for a little while, they've had a student with similar, if not identical thoughts.   That's what I've never understood when IMF/WB/US go into a country that has comparatively 0 GDP. Why not work with them through investments that actually lift people out of poverty so they can then ask for more money to build nicer things and make everyone more money. I know this is extremely simplified, but it seems like a win win.   I ask my friends "can't or won't?" a lot. They all watch Archer and usually it's both.  	13

 Yeh but there's lots of cultural stuff we don't adhere to anymore, so its not really an excuse, although I know you're not excusing it   Mgs has never been that subtle in terms of exposition, so I didn't see a discord.   Kojima's games are very anti-war so I expect this game to be no different and potentially more confronting including the child soldier stuff mentioned in other games.  Its most likely going to be the most hellish game of the series' given the characters, subject matter and it evoking classic anti war Oliver Stone films like Platoon.   Played Peace Walker before this second time playing MGS4...  Big Boss' death ;_; omg so damn fucking tragic.  All the regret and sorrow for what he did to the world, chained to the shackles of his ideals of "liberty". Giving Solid the true freedom to stop fighting and take peace.  Holy fuck, after Peace Walker too, when The Boss AI accepts peace and this angers Big Boss in that game, here you see him finally accept it.  Jesus christ, this is the same game where a weirdo soldier poops his butt for a whole act. Lol.  Seriously, fantastic ending.   Awesome   This looks great! How did they make this? I prefer new tomb raider but old TR is cool too :) is this based on an alien invasion? Will it feature the orson welles radioplay? Omg that'd be amazing, imagine that - probably copyright issues though with that.   Fair enough, I definitely think there is a huge space for historically accurate games! History is so damn rich and it's weird that Ubisoft is the only AAA dev to really use it outside of wars.   hows gaming on it? steam, gog, etc?      To be fair to Assassin's creed, those games engage people with history far more than most other popular media. When I played Assassin's creed, I won't deny that I googled the American revolution to get more immersed in the world. Whose to say other people didn't delve even further as a result?  Think I'm going to do a video on that at some point actually, could be interesting topic.         Iran is such a fascinating country with a tumultuous history, I absolutely loved "The Cat and the Coup" - a free, simple and interesting, game on steam. Gives you some interesting political history about the country in the 50's, which might give some good background/context to the next 1979 revolution? I can't remember.  This will be very interesting to see the 1979 revolution. Wow. I am actually really excited, I love seeing non-western centric politics in games, it just feels a bit refreshing ya know?     Yeah basically anything fan service-y (right word yes?) is pretty cringe. That said, I wouldnt mind seeing it even out with:  1. Less scantily clad women 2. More sexualised men  Sexuality in and of itself is not a bad thing. It is bad when the character is an object to the audience and/or is dressed/acts to allure the audience.  Positive example: MGS4 is an ass simulator, and whose ass you looking at? Snakes. (Ignoring the leery camerawork on the women in the game here)  I think the main issue is when women are treated like sexual objects for audience pleasure in games. The game of war ad evokes that, although Kate Upton im sure IRL is a very capable human being.  Snake, on the otherhand, is a fully realized character and also happens to wear skin tight outfit with no shame in his old muscley man body. If that can be conveyed with a woman that would be no real issue to me.   I see no benefit to starting a witch hunt, which is the kind of thing that happens inadvertedly after these kinds of reviews, especially to smaller devs with no PR, company or fanbase - based on a few kickstarter discrepancies.   People attributing malice is pretty extreme accusation.    They might have got friends and family to chip in? Kickstarter is a complete gamble, I don't feel it has the credence to justify an outrage if you pay money to a kickstarter (an obscure one at that) it's not the same as thinking your buying a finished product.   In terms of Steam, there are refunds these days anyway.   This review seems out of place, I am still uncomfortable it was published in this current fashion, given the potential online knock on effects.   People equate honesty in disliking something with being agressive, I see that as a false equation. You can recommend against buying a game without dropping outrage that will inadvertedly spur on a huge audience to make this devs life miserable.   1 . Ending a review with "Unfortunately I didn't enjoy this game much, especially the character models, which needed more work to scare me. I hope the developer can learn from these points with future games. 1/10" is different from "Oh, and the scary little girl looks shit. 1/10"  They convey different attitudes to the audience.  2 . Jim is a top tier reviewer, there are games with bigger potential audiences that would probably appreciate a review from him more than a small indie dev who probably didnt' expect to get much attention at all. There are knock on effects to doing an anomalous review in this way.  It's a sledgehammer approach the gaming community often misapplies.    People will use words like "scam" to justify their own torrents of disdain, though. Feeling righteous is the path to actually doing a lot of damage, sadly. His audience could easily take this way too far based off the "feeling" of the review alone.  I also don't agree with the idea that small games shouldn't be criticized, because people have feeling.I also don't agree with the idea that small games shouldn't be criticized, because people have feeling.  Criticism comes in many different forms, and some are more appropriate than others, especially with context. You can say very similar messages in different ways. Obviously no one is saying they can't be criticized, but what about constructive criticism? Why does there have to be a tone of outrage to the review, what does that do to improve the lives of consumers and creators?   Jim, when talking about a game he enjoys, is actually the reason I keep abreast of his work. He does brilliant explanations on why he loves something in a game.  Re: Squirty plays, I like them when Jim enjoys the game, when he dislikes it, it sometimes gets out of hand, especially when you see the audience comments afterwards. Even when Jim doesn't use pejorative language, the comments may do it anyway :/  To be fair though, there are some Squirty plays that Jim probably isn't enjoying, but still plays it earnestly and without pejorative language.  I find the whole "honest reaction" thing a bit skewed, though, because while we may occaisionally swear "honestly" at the TV or whatever in our private homes, it's not the same when you broadcast that to an audience of thousands who will then interpret and run with it in numerous, often incorrect, ways.   Yeah look, most people would expect some criticism for any game they put out there (I plan on releasing a game at some point, after all). Unfortunately, with a high profile critic (with a huge audience) and a review that gives it a 1/10 without much context as to who the dev is and the last word of the review being "shit" - well, that's a nuclear strike for a smaller developer.  Consider this: huge companies have had to mobilize huge PR teams to counter Jim's ire and the audience reaction that comes with it.  I dunno, I just feel uncomfortable about this kind of review.   That second user comment on the review page (from user "The Gustavler") :/ not cool  I feel Jim would be happier if he focused on other games instead of finding small games he can tear into. How much of his audience would have played this game? How many are going to play it now and flood the developers page with vitriol because of this review? What will that achieve?  Im worried about the negative aura gaming community is cultivating.  Anyway I really enjoy Jim's work generally speaking, just prefer less negativity.

 Not the OP, but Charizard :D   Why do such horrible things keep on happening?   Nope. Was the first day of class, went with my sister for admission.   Seriously. Never expected this.   xD   She just stared screaming "Get out!". I don't just know what happened.   No, an external coaching class...   Got pushed out of a chemistry classtoday in Pune when the teacher understood I was a Gujurati, with she screaming at the top of her voice, "You guys do business, don't come for academics." :(   /uj I hope /u/ladfrombrad you are not offended :)   Numix and Numix circle icon pack...  Numix is really nice.   Yes, I am Indian, and I watch Bollywood movies, but I found only some of them like Lagaan, 3 Idiots or PK to be great. I prefer Hollywood animated movies over anything.   Thanks! :D   Mmmmmm...... is... [this](http://imgur.com/4mvJeZS)... enough for a sample???    :'(   Ummmm.... I don't think so...   /uj I don't mean to replace Duarte with Pichai, but just a temporary fun experiment.   ladfrombrad = ~~shillfrombrad~~     Stalinfrombrad.   I'm pretty sure it will, it has a 100% rating on RT as of yet!   The first ten minutes of Up were the most emotional moments in any animated movie.   Brave was okay-ish at best. Pixar hasn't really made an excellent film after TS3.   Well... the movie wasn't so popular in my country, so I had never heard of it. And as I was on an animated movie watching spree, I just stumbled across this one and was pleasantly surprised :)   I just saw it 2 days ago for the first time, and I am wishing I should have seen it earlier!   Yes, MU was great, but it wasn't up to Pixar's high standards.   I just love the Toy Story trilogy, I can never get enough of them.   Toy Story 3 is my favourite film ever, but Up was mind-blowing as well, and definitely one of my favourites. Inside Out looks very promising, and it looks like Pixar might finally be back on track.   Yup, Pixar's Toy Story trilogy, Finding Nemo, the Incredibles, Wall-E, Monsters, Inc. and A Bug's Life were amazing. Here's hoping the same for Inside Out!   I rewatched Wreck-It Ralph today, and it's really an amazing film.   The Toy Story trilogy. Even I am on an anmated movies watcing spree, and I have watched tons of them in the last few days.       Yes, enjoying last few moments of freedom!   Last day of vacations, just enjoying it :)   Very sleepy, 3.10 am here.   **WE DID IT REDDIT!**   Okay.   **HITLER IS AN APPROVED PROPHET!**   Yep XD   :O ???   Where have you been?   Pete Docter.   Hi! Seeing you after some time :)      So... Did you buy it?   I found [Rapunzel](http://agoofyidea.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/rapunzel.jpg) from Tangled to be the most attractive.   /u/ladfrombrad   DuARTe's chosen disciple    Someone please x-post this to /r/Jokes.   "I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically."    Ladfrombrad is botfrombrad confirmed.   /u/trollabot ladfrombrad   I will surely see!   Yup, I haven't even seen any Hobbit films :(   I've never seen any LoTR movie... :(   It's a really good film, especially if you like Pooh. You should definitely watch it. I am currently watching a lot of Disney and Pixar films.   Winnie the Pooh (2011) :P It was a great film, though.   It's 1.30 am here, and the only things that I did today were cycling and watching a movie.   /uj Isn't this quiet like /r/AndroidMasterCard?   Yes! :D   First, you should **BuyANexus**   Thanks :)   I might try to order it now... I'll look for it on Amazon.   But not available anywhere in my country :(   I like blue colour!   I craving to see Spirited Away :(   Toy Story 3.   Yes, Lord DuARTe blesses everyone.   Mark as NSFW!   Diwali is the biggest festival in India, and the celebrations here are grand. It is like the Christmas here :)   MKBHD.   /uj I really lked the new sidebar image and thanks for the replacing of the submit button!   But... M = 1000!   I cannot fathom my heresy! I will whip myself 1000 times now and ask Lord DuARTe for forgiveness!   I should've have seen it earlier!   A Nexus 5 with KitKat? Damn, you're old.   Edit: Forgive me for my heresy.   It's just awesome!   The Nightmare Before Christmas?   Which one OS best   That guy's certainly not using Google Keyboard.   Yes, a big one!   Almost 6 PM here :)   Says the heretic who's trying to burn himself with an M9.   Though the Mumbai showed in the cartoon is far from the reality, I seriously love the new Mickey shorts!   **HITLER IS AN APPROVED PROPHET!**   But... but... they made the Nexus 9!   The MCG! It's too damn huge!   In most cases, yes :)   Yup. I know!    The current name is too hard too pronounce. Thiruvananthapuram.   I'm kinda used to it now!   Skyscrapers.   Yup, staple Indian food.   /uj Yes. I am a huge Pixar fan.   Yes!   True!   Mumbai.   Ummm... Probably Diwali holiday here in India...      All people in Chile are blessed.   I am just lazing around currently...   **BURN THE TREES!**   Hey, what's up?   10 AM here in India, and it's very sunny.   No Netflix in my country :(   Yes, Cars 1 wasn't good. The story was not sensible.   Blue inked!   I liked MU a lot, too, but it wasn't up to Pixar's standards  Brave was an okay-ish kind of film. Cars 2 on the other hand...   Let's hope it would be good, there really hasn't been a good Pixar movie since Toy Story 3.   Here's the good dinosaur trailer, if you are interested :) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1nfAxkpx9M   But I'm didn't really like the trailer of The Good Dinosaur. The dinosaurs look too goofy...   Adding the founder of iVerge to the list of Approved Prophets? **NEVER!**   Also, Finding Dory might ruin Finding Nemo, too. Inside Out looks very promising, though.   I think You are right. I am not really sure about it, let's hope Cars 3 comes after it! Also, they should scrap their plans of making Toy Story 4. The trilogy is almost perfect, they might ruin it with this one...   Cars 3 is coming before it :'(   It was 2017, but then delayed :( I am desperately waiting for The Incredibles 2, though :)   But the third is coming in 2018 :(   Even I did a back to back watch! It's amongst my favourite movies now!   The whole two new apps would be coming Soon    I watched How to Train Your Dragon 2 yesterday :)  	113
 Real life actors, no character feats allowed.   Scenario 1: Should be no problem for the Klingons tbh. I'm sure their personal deflector shields would easily withstand anything the Predator can throw at them. His camoflauge would be the hardest thing to deal with, but it'd basically be a matter of time.  Scenario 2: Tougher call. I'd say Klingons actual combat abilities are overrated and most of their advantages over humans come from more durability. They have redundant organs and a tough skeletal system, and I believe (could be wrong, I know Vulcans do) a stronger immunity to poisons. This would make it hard for the Predator to actually land a fatal blow.  On the other hand, Klingons are used to fighting unarmoured opponents (since their main combat is with Starfleet/Romulans, who don't wear armour due to it generally being pointless) so I'm unsure how a  Bat'leth would deal with Predator armour. I'm unfamiliar with Predator's combat skills or physiology. Maybe a strong Klingon like Worf wins, but a weaker Klingon would lose.   It's the current US Shark Tank. Each character goes on assuming a secret identity - that of a young entrepreneur in their early 20s. This eliminates the default perception of the character (ie. investors feeling safer investing with Wayne, a billionaire, as opposed to a mere Uni student). However, they keep their current personalities. **Important note: Any item pitched is free from existing patents, etc., so basically ignore issue of ownership for existing items**  **Round 1)** Each pitches one of their signature items. Specifically:  *  Wayne pitches his utility belt, complete with non-Bat themed grappling hook, boomerrangs and smoke grenades. * Peter pitches his web shooters. * Tony Stark pitches a jetpack that can be controlled with body movements * Reed pitches three uniforms: one flame resistant, one allowing camouflage and one that can be stretched without damaging it (imagine the wash cycles this baby could withstand). He can get a deal on all or one costume.  **Round 2)** Each makes a new invention designed to resolve a common household problem. It can be any problem, but must be applicable to a typical home. They have 24 hours to choose a problem and create the solution. Each has $500,000,000 at their disposal for some overnight R D. And what problem do you think each is likely to address?  **Round 3)** Any invention they have ever made - they MUST have made it personally (eg. Batman didn't make a lot of his gadgets). Pick the one you think would have the most success from each character and pit them against eachother.  Remember to take into account marketability, affordability (even the Shark Tank guys aren't likely to pitch in for a Batmobile) and the individual personalities of the Shark Tank hosts. I haven't seen much US Shark Tank, but I know in the Australian version you can get an idea of which host is likely to go for which products.  If this thread has moderate success, I'll do another for super villains tomorrow.   Actually there are studies that show it effects buying patterns.   Some kids at my school were running around shouting 'FIGHT!' once. There was a crowd following them and me and my friends joined in. Eventually the crowd was massive and drew the attention of teachers. After doing a full lap of he school, people slowly started to realise there was no fight, and no one knew who started the chanting or where the pack was being guided   This makes no sense in the context of breaking the speed barrier in order to travel through time   Where do you think we are?   But candy is bad for your teeth   Because of all the dinosaurs?   The students that are confused by a simple definition should probably study a different subject   I was there when this thread happened. It was just a Timezone difference. OP had nothing to do with the murder      Can't wreck the Shreck   In 1990 MC Hammer released his magnum opus "Please Hammer, Don't Hurt 'Em" to critical and popular acclaim. The album featured his number one hit, U Can't Touch This, which for years people have believed to be a statement of fact.  However, upon listening to the album for the tenth time and going over some MC Hammer interviews and videos, I think I have developed a fan theory that puts this song into question.  **Exhibit A:** The lyrics of "U Can't Touch This" are pretty clear. Hammer claims that he is untouchable. And yet, we can see in numerous photos that he can, in fact, be touched. Here is a [rare photo](http://www.gettyimages.ae/detail/news-photo/adam-yauch-of-beastie-boys-chris-rock-coco-doug-e-fresh-and-news-photo/109566302) of MC Hammer being touched by one Christopher Rock. This shows that it is in fact possible to touch MC Hammer.  So the song is false? A lie? Well, maybe not.   **Exhibit B:** Let's take a look at the albums first three tracks:  1. "Here Comes the Hammer"   MC Hammer 4:32  2. "U Can't Touch This"   James   Miller 4:17  3. "Have You Seen Her" (The Chi-Lites cover)  What's that? Track number one? "Here Comes the Hammer"? On an album called "Please Hammer, Don't Hurt 'Em"? Here are some of the lyrics: "When you came to walk on the stage after me / And if you do your catastrophe happenin's / Just like that out like a mall white to black"  The song goes on in this fashion, describing one musician bringing a hammer down on another. One might first assume that it is MC Hammer's hammer. But can we be sure? Perhaps it is a rival musician, striking MC Hammer himself with said hammer, causing him to be knocked out "white to black"!  **Exhibit C:** So then the song goes into MC Hammer's dreamscape, where he can't be touched, mirroring his inability to dodge the blow that befell him at the start of the album. The next song? A cover! Why? Because upon MC Hammer's recovery from the coma, he is too delirious to write his own song!  The evidence stands before you people, but feel free to make up your own minds.  I also strongly suggest you go and grab this album of your shelves and give it another listen, it's truly a top 10 of all time.   * DOODLEbug * FollowINg * The DARK Knight (a fan off BBC?) * The Dark Knight RISES (rock hard BBC?) * Side by Side (Men) * Man of Steel (oh come ON Nolan!)

I also strongly suggest you go and grab this album of your shelves and give it another listen, it's truly a top 10 of all time.   Note that I don't do a set amount, I just go until failure.  With sets, I started doing 15 at a time, then progressed to 20 at a time. Usually do 3 full sets and then fail on the fourth.  Doing no sets, I usually do around 30-40, fail, then try again, usually hitting 3-4 more before failing and stop.  Sets I do more all up, but I'm breaking them up. Doing them in one run I do less.  Which is better?   What if the true villains... are US?   Or it's a fake castle and Bowser paid for the advertising during construction to have it Bowser themed   Wayne's assets are frozen and Wayne Enterprises probably under close scrutiny. How does the "new" Batman (totally not Bruce Wayne) fund his antics?   You're a criminal: A new Batman has re-emerged. OK, maybe it's not Bruce. But he's the best suspect you've got, so you go after Bruce's allies anyway, knowing it's a potential weak spot.  Maybe it is a new Batman, but it's a better shot than going in blind.   So I'm guessing they're keeping Half-Life 3 on standby in case these experiments blow up in their faces?   I guess we just interpret the title differently. I don't see "Americans don't know X" as saying all Americans, but simply pointing out that the people in this video are Americans and should therefore be less ignorant about the subject.      I've been playing Dota2 for about 6 months now and I think I've been getting quite good. I'm currently sitting on about 2.5k MMR, but I think my potential is probably around the 7-8k mark. I hope to play in next years International. BUT I've hit a bit of a roadblock.  I've found recently, that when things aren't going while, I can't seem to convince my teammates to do what I say and win the game. No matter what racial slurs I use or no matter how many family members I threaten to fuck they just. won't. listen. I need advice, because I feel like my career in Dota2 has some great potential, but I just can't get past this roadblock.  Thanks!   Yeah, isn't /r/cringe just cherrypicking too? This is a compilation of people getting things wrong.  Blizzard/Minecon videos showing just the cringey questions are also cherrypicking.   Those are some ugly ass titties.   Just copying my reply from above:   So a regular human child would be capable of performing that level of agility and accuracy, while blindfolded, as Ciri did at the start of The Witcher 3, if they just got some training?  If that qualifies as "not bad", then are humans from the Witcher universe just better than real humans? Kind of like how Batman 'doesn't have superpowers'?   It was his last performance as the Joker, technically!   So a regular human child would be capable of performing that level of agility and accuracy, while blindfolded, as Ciri did at the start of The Witcher 3, if they just got some training?      I wasn't suggesting Penguin or Two-Face be strong, I was suggesting they include more foes that actually pose a threat in the first place. There was no reason they couldn't include, say, Bane, or Killer Croc.  Also they could have done some great stuff with those characters. Imagine Croc infected with the fear toxin, rampaging through Gotham, ten times more aggressive than he has ever been.   What's the point of this?   Wet vag   Wait, humans are from another dimension? I need to finish the books      It's obviously Gordon from the future going back in time to avenge Barbara.   He could have killed Batman 1,000 times over. He doesn't want to beat him easily, he wants to beat him in a very specific manner.   I feel like this game could have used a few traditional boss fights. Penguin and Two-Face were the next biggest villains after Scarecrow and they were basically just generic thugs. Probably my only complaint with the game.   They didn't have Facebook back then. Tbh I'm not sure if they even had the Internet   Well it's wrong. I maintain the machines that cut money at supermarkets   I guess they don't want to devalue cards, but even that seems too low   Arkham Knight is pretty dank   No   But aren't they all rich?

Is there a good video that would demonstrate a medieval battle, especially up close. Whenever I read about 'lines clashing' I always just picture a bunch of guys pushing their shields against one another, awkwardly trying to whack the guys over the top of them and failing comically.   they are basically bacteria encrusted food stuck in your tonsils, ever coughed up some foul small whitish semi hard waxy bit that smelled so foul you imagined satan has consummated with your throat?  No.  I'll get my gums checked on my next appointment, but they've never commented on any issues with my gums and I get a yearly checkup. I will make sure to specifically mention the smell when I floss next time I go.   I brush right before bed, and after 8 hours sleep my mouth tastes awful and I have bad morning breath. I floss twice a day as well as brush, and often mouthwash. If bacteria aren't thriving, then why does my mouth taste and smell awful in the morning?   I don't mean to be picky, but doesn't this break rule one. Direct responses to a CMV post must challenge at least one aspect of OPs stated view (however minor), unless they are asking a clarifying question. I wouldn't say this challenges his view as the argument is he SHOULD be allowed to frequent all gay bars, not whether he can or not. Whether he can or not is irrelevant to whether he should be allowed to or not.   I don't mean to be picky, but doesn't this break rule one.

The only source I can find on this is:   In 2008, 6.0% of divorces involved separation within the first year of marriage, 32.7% within the first 5 years and a further 21.7% were separated within 5 to 9 years of marriage. Of divorcing couples in 2008, 16.8% were married less than 5 years, 24.6% between 5 and 9 years and 58.6% were married for 10 years or more. Around 17.2% of divorces occurred to couples who had been married for 25 years or more.  http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/0/947114F16DC7D980CA25773700169C64?opendocument  Seems like 90% is still too good of a rate for that approach.

So it's ok for gay or sterile people to be incestuous then?   So Earth is never in any real danger?   This is the first time I've heard a "WHEEEEEEW!" on a sitcom in a long time (occurs at start of the video when the blonde walks out).  It's like it's satire of bad 80s sitcoms or something?   hahahaha didn't expect to see a star trek meme on this sub. bravo!

Operating a camera is a lot more difficult than just pointing it in the general direction of someone. It's not rocket science, sure, but you still have to be able to frame things perfectly, make sure to begin recording in a timely fashion, keep it steady, move around, etc.  They're also freaking heavy. A koala just doesn't have the upper body strength to support a camera like this.

Let's get you laid son   I believe the moon landing was real, but... Could t we just make up that distance and say it's precise and due to mirrors on the moon?   He's smart enough to have worked this out.   Just got watching the Nolan trilogy and it was pretty damn good. But one thing that stood out was how he kept the identity of Batman a secret throughout the entire franchise. A bit of a blow to comic book 'purists' who wanted it to be Wayne, but a very interesting approach nonetheless.  What intrigued me most though where the hints that either Wayne or Harvey Dent are Batman (Rachel hinting at Dent being Wayne, or Alfred making allusions to Wayne being Batman). I believe this was a red herring. Obviously, Dent cannot be Batman as the twist showed Batman killing Dent at the end of the second film.  However, this still leaves Wayne as a potential candidate. But, of course, why would Nolan go to such lengths to conceal Batman's identity if it's just going to be the same character from the comic books? I believe Batman isn't Wayne or any other likely candidate, but is in fact a woman.  The costume goes to great effort to be much bulkier than other Batman costumes - to hide breats, hips, etc. Additionally, Catwoman is the only other person in the Nolanverse to be as skilled as Batman - a hint that in THIS universe, it is actually women who are the stronger gender.  Finally, calling yourself BatMAN is a dead give away. I believe whoever Batman is is smart enough to not eliminate 50% of the population from being potential suspects, so he (or SHE) named herself BatMAN to throw people off her scent.  Thoughts?   I have been tinkering with this theory for awhile. In the cartoon Rickle Morty about super genius scientists and dumb gfandson. i believe Aquaman does not exist. here is my list of evidence.  1.

Secondly, there are less (again, hopefully!) permanent ways to remember and show off something you like.   Nothing or everything depending on your circles. I work in a professional environment where that sort of thing would be looked down on. I date professional women who wouldn't want a partner obsessed with video games.  I still love Zelda, but I love it because it's fun to play. I don't need to show others I like something. I don't agree with looking down on people for doing that though.  At any rate, I'm not going to let a minor pastime get in the way of making money and 10/10 titties.  Basically, while not always true, there is a general stereotype associated with people who like video game paraphernalia. You're basically labelling yourself in the eyes of others as someone who fits this stereotype. No one wants that's stereotype working for them or dating them.   What about gay incestuous relationships? They can be allowed then?   Can't you just say "no incestuous relationships until you are over the age of 18"?   The point being, you can come to Reddit and access /r/mechanicalkeyboards and /r/dota2 and /r/witcher and /r/dragonsfuckingcars all in one place.  Now say /r/mechanicalkeyboards community hates a change Reddit admin makes. Now the community becomes fragmented. Some people leave, some people stay, the people that leave form different communities. But the other three subreddits stay. You're still visiting Reddit for those.  It's very hard for any one change on Reddit to encourage a significant enough group of people to cause them to care. I loved /r/fatpeoplehate, but I'm not about to up and leave for ten different websites so I can continue accessing communities I like when they're all still here on Reddit. Most people are like this.  Edit: For clarity, yes, it might happen overtime. The key words from my post and the guy I replied to are: commit suicide like digg did  for it fall like Digg did  My point is: Reddit's death will be a slow grind, not a quick fall - if it dies anytime soon at all.   I'll take the downvotes for this.  But imagine if his interests shift away from videogames in another 5-10 years, and now he has a (hopefully!) permanent symbol of his old hobby on his hand that makes him look like a complete manchild.   As an Australian, the "Australia is fucking dangerous" circlejerk is a load of crap.   Maybe he shaves for aerodynamic purposes   Winner fights Bayonetta.   Maybe he was hoping the pressure of being 'on stage' would convince the crowd to go along, similar to hypnotists?   I know, morbid question. I'm asking more for a ballpark. Do most people take a few days off? Weeks? Months? What if you have no leave accrued?   Holy shit that website is awful.   Reddit has too many tight knit, departmentalized communities for it fall like Digg did. One sub fucks up or ten subs fuck up, maybe the admins fuck up, it won't really matter to 99% of Reddit users who just want to access a particular group of subreddits.   Look at what humans achieved with 10 toes. Now imagine what we could do with 11!   What exactly are the challenges that make this such a difficult task, despite all the other amazing advancements in medical science?   I didn't expect anything.  fun to play  Well they dropped the ball there imo.   I've only played a handful of games, so I'll happily concede if I'm wrong, but at the moment is seems like stuffing your deck with high value cards is the easiest way to win.  There are no 'resources', no progression from being able to play weak cards to high cards or anything else preventing you from just putting all your best cards into one deck.  The depth pretty much seems limited to determining whether to bait your opponent into playing more cards or not on a specific row and how to divide your cards up. It's just a side-game, so not a big deal, but I love card games so this seems a bit disappointing at the moment.   Yes it is old    I doubt it considering all the tattoos that say stuff like 'cum slut' and 'I eat pussy'   This makes assumptions about the types of people who will hit on her.  For example, perhaps having a large penis makes you more confident in flirting with more attractive women (and vice versa).  Men with larger dongs may actually just flirt more in general.  So while the average penis is 5-6 inches, to average penis girls have put inside them might be much larger.   Do I really have to farm them? I'm on Death March and buying lots of ingredients doesn't seem good either. Are there any areas particularly useful for gathering ingredients, or do I just have to take note of where mobs/ingredients are and farm?   TIL humans are completely rational.   Or someone who doesn't think Nuclear War is likely and so takes the position for the huge pay it probably comes with.   These are lyrics from Michael Jackson's "Smooth Criminal". Google wasn't actually hit by a criminal.    Ask him what his favourite memes are.   Are you talking about penetrating her vagina with his penis?   This nigga needs to get laid.   Would you say his knees are weak, arms are heavy?   You're right, it isn't.   I was using the crossbow/aard to stun him. I'm dealing about 109-170 damage with strong attacks (depending on whether potion is up) at the moment (level 2).  Are there better weapons available?   I'm trying to knock him down with crossbow, strike him, aard, strike again, then rinse and repeat. It's just tedious though and the most I've got him down to is 3/4 health.   from quests, that is? I'm barely damaging it.   The Crunchy Munchy      "These types of videos" doesn't apply here because this is a video about child endangerment, not a street fight/sucker punch.

 You've allowed what others think of you to be offensive, instead of embracing it. You take power away when you hold it to your heart, not shun it away in disgust. You mention stereotypes over and over again, all I hear is lack of confidence from within. Embrace those ideas, they come from somewhere, and it's really, really funny once you stop caring about what others think of you.   Let go   Art can most certainly be offensive. And you've allowed it to do such. But why? Does femininity scare you? Should all gay men be machismo? Should we ignore our history in drag, of Stonewall, of gender bending, of camp, of flamboyance, all for the prevalence of leading, dominating, and repressive heterosexual culture?  I think we have and do.   100%, you knew what I meant.   /r/gaybros called.   Holy shit, people, chill.  The bank does work with the local Pride parade. It's art for fun's sake.  It's hardly offensive, it's just fun. Also, it's in one of the most progressive cities on earth for gay rights. The bank, the city, the people have a history with LGBT culture.  ...did I also mention it's just, like, art?   Yeah I wanted to post something from Temple Grandin, where she talks about dogs loving that small space, like a cave or a den (couldn't find a good direct quote off the inter webs).   Though if someone did something to a beta dog in the past, like hurt the pup in a corner, or just ignore them in a kennel for hours and hours, we have to work in baby steps to regain the trust and go forward. Prettttttty sure you get that. Cool.   Sorry to hijack this thread too, but I just noticed the 'breed'.  Shibu Inus are high energy, been used for hunting small game for years. Chows, while not so energetic, definitely have a job. Protecting large spaces, patrolling.   My siberian husky, similar spitz like mentality, strongly dislikes being constricted, limited in mobility. Even as a dog groomer, I muzzle him start to finish.  The only thing that calms him down, allowing me to man-handle him or put him in any size kennel I want? Exercise. A jerby-jerb. He get's out his 'husky drive', I don't have to deal with his anxiety. Just another idea...   Ouch. Yeah rescues can be tricky. You never know what they've been through in their past.  Have you tried baby steps? Gated area with you in the room. Good behavior? Treats. Make the gated area smaller. More treats. Work your way down. Good behavior means treats. Talking does little.

The dog needs to be fixed for one.   Two, it's cruel. Dogs and wolves should never be mixed.   Let's go with with three, there are far too many dogs in the world.   sadly, euthanasia.    Spotted a male Romanian mioritic shepherd dog at a coffee shop. I only know this cause the owner told me about his breed history and personal story.  He flew to California on AirFrance from Transylvania. His brothers are herding dogs (this will be an important detail in a bit.) He hates squirrels with a passion, but instead of biting them, he bats them like baseballs with his monster paws.  In Romania, he has three brothers (probably more but the breeder keeps three males). The brothers are raised together with the herder, the flock, and a donkey. The donkey is sometimes the first line of defense from bears and wolves. If the donkey is attacked by a bear, the brothers get in formation. Two brothers will distract the bear by barking and swiping their paws. The third brother will sneak from behind and attack the bear's back legs. This could go on for hours, with the bear then running away, never messing with said flock again.  As the owner was telling me this story in a thick Transylvanian accent, the dog was circling me, he was working me. So cool.   I think she's a mutt and not any breed.  But that aside, I see Australian cattle dog for sure.   Hopefully your wiki-ity roof doesn't leak.   I don't know... I broke the lightbulb after I threw the first one.   That's fucking beautiful, mate.   "So shines a good deed in a weary world."   That you are two completely separate people with two different sets of beliefs, opinions, and personalities.

If they want to keep a Grindr profile, that's their deal, not yours. If they don't want to go to church, that's their deal. If they think your brother is a self righteous douche-nozzle, then that's their opinion and you have to respect it.  Honesty and trust. All boils down to those two.   Oh no worries man.

No, more like the stink bugs someone else posted, and I shit you not, it shot out delicious Big Red spray.

I'm sorry for the late reply but Facebook doesn't alert me of all the comments posted on the pictures    Thank you so much for your interest in my work, I'm very glad you like it. At the moment I don't have prints or originals available for sale, I'm planning on having some art prints soon, I'll post it on this page and let you know when I have them ready. Thank you again, have a great weekend! Like  89  December 19, 2013 at 10:47pm   Yay! I love hearing pug owners that train their pups to be chill with that.   But he was the poster of the repost....

 Yeah, my kids haven't seen this yet. Fixing that tonight.             I'm the only wage earner in my family of four, and we recently found out our home (rental) sold...and we have 40 some days to get out. Things are progressing nicely, but it worries me at night...anything goes wrong in the next couple weeks would be a tragedy level event...  My kids are 5 and 7...my five yo girl doesn't want to move, and I worry for her...hoping that she adjusts to the move well.  Other than that, I'm good. The usual worries; losing my job, hoping the car makes it another year, the health of my family, my long term outlooks, our retirement.   Jesus, I've got a lot to worry about. Thanks.      Yeah, I know....but it just looks so good. After outperforming Pierce and going up against that Pitt defense...could be a decent performance.              When someone wrongs us, there are two possible places to lay the blame; on ourselves, or on the person that wronged us.  This quote focuses on us, assuming that we already are forgiving of the person that wronged us, but reminds us not to think negatively of the decisions that we made that put us in the position to be hurt or treated badly by this other person.  We already don't hate him, but don't hate yourself for lettin' him hate you, you dig.   Depends on where in Florida you're going. The state of Florida has a rich history, with many different museums focusing on the different places in history that Florida has figured. From Ocean Pond in Olustee, in the north, site of one of only two Civil War battles fought in Florida, and certainly the bloodiest, to the Seminole Rez outside of Okeechobee, in the south, home of the last survivors of the Seminole Indians, a proud race that never submitted to the US.  Cape Canaveral and Kennedy Space Station in the mid-east of the state is America's Space Station. Can't go wrong there!   On the mid-west coast, you have everything from the Ringling Museum in Sarasota to the Dali in St. Petersburg. Ft. Desoto, south of Tampa Bay, is an post-Augustine-era defense fort where you can learn about the first Europeans in Florida.   Or just check out St. Augustine itself...in the northeast, site of possibly one of the oldest European presences on the state. (There is some evidence that Turnbull's site in New Smyrna Beach might be the oldest.)  This isn't even close to an all-inclusive list. Anywhere that you look in Florida, you will find some history. You might want to narrow your trip down, and then check the county website for the area(s) you are interested in visiting.          Unplug it.  Then use needle nose pliers. First, try to grip one end of the metal thingamabob and turn it that way, and if that doesn't work, use the pliers the opposite way....instead of to pinch, expand them to fill the metal thingamabob and try to twist it out that way.  Or, live dangerously, and after unplugging the lamp, cut a potato in half, jam it into the socket, and twist. It should pull the broken light bulb out with it. You must clean the socket before reusing, and for fuck's sake, dry your hands before plugging the lamp back in.  Don't forget to unplug the lamp.         I used to watch the shit out of this show with my folks. I was 13 or so when it came on, back in the day of the big 3...(only having three or four channels to choose from). Our neighbourhood went cable the year or so after it went off the air...'85 or so? Thanks for the flashback. I was looking through some of the other suggested vids so I could nostalgia harder, and saw a piece about Tiger Woods. When he was 9. That's Incredible!         Sandy Mangina.   Thanks. I'll work on that next field day.    I've looked at that too. If I release flat, it's gone. If I release slightly on the hyzer, it'll flip straight, but then continue over right.

Love to see an answer on this. I disced down last summer, and have gotten my form in better shape, and then dealt with a rounding issue, and now I think I have my form in pretty good shape, and I stepped up to speed 10's (Gstar Beast)  and slice 'em right....waaaaaaayyyy right.

If two men are standing outside a bar on the street and having a fight, and one man gets the  better of the other, and the losing guy pulls a gun, then doesn't the guy winning the fight then have the right to shoot the loser of the fight? If I'm standing there watching, and I see that the loser of the fight pulls a gun to protect himself, and then the winner of the fight pulls a gun to protect himself from the loser of the fight, don't I have a right to shoot the both of them to protect myself from becoming an innocent bystander? If I pull my gun to protect myself from the now two armed fighters from accidentally shooting me, wouldn't you have the right as another bystander to shoot the three of us? Does this sort of thinking have any end?   13K....I don't know if I would have guessed higher or lower. I knew I had 10k because I had the glider, but stopped caring after that.                                                 Well, at least the things on your grocery shelves, anyway.         I play a local short course as my home course as well. It would all depend on how you approached me. I play fairly well, but a local regular stopped me on the turn one afternoon and said that he was watching me play and thought that he could help me take three to four strokes off my game. Then he asked if I'd like to play a round with him at some other time. I took him up on it, and played a round at our course and a round at our local pro course, and he gave me a couple of tips. They didn't take those three to four strokes off my game, but it helped.     Does a one legged kangaroo jump in a circle?   Does the Pope wear pointy shoes?  Does the Pope wear a funny hat?

We don't do an allowance per se, but I monetize certain awards and achievements. They often receive money as gifts, either birthday/christmas money, or just randomly when I have a couple of bucks in my pocket. We're not big consumers, we focus instead on making things and arts and crafts. I'm not anti allowance by any means, but just haven't seen the need for a stricter definition of it. Glad to change that as the kids get older.  As for hitting, we have always said that they have the right to defend themselves, but they must exhaust every other option first.             I agree with much of what you say. I cruised through scope.com after running into this article, and there is much there that is well intentioned but perhaps goes to far. I just try to remember not to examine the disability, and instead examine the person, and that method often sorts out that problem easily enough.      Florida Citizen: ' I strongly urge' Jeb Bush to shut the fuck up.   What the surveillance video shows is Brown having an altercation with the shopkeeper. It may have been about a robbery...of a fifty dollar box of cigars. So, in OP's opinion, as long as you're a suspect in a minor strong arm robbery, it's completely okay to be gunned down in the street, even after you've surrendered. Stop defending the actions of the domestic military police, OP. Even if you're a criminal, you still have rights. Right to a trial. Right to confront your accuser. Right to hear your charges. There is no right of the police to decide you're guilty and execute you in the street.  I understand your comment about Sharpton. He and his ilk swarm to stories like this to forward their own initiatives. But your comment "No surprise really..." (that was quickly edited) shows that we need a whole lot more people like the ones that working hard to show this story in the light of the very real racism and double standards that exist in our society.  We heard this same nonsense when Martin was shot in Florida. It didn't matter that a man had died once we understood that Martin was probably carrying or using drugs. Now we see the Ferguson authorities releasing information about this possible robbery even though they are tight lipped about the shooting. Why? Because we don't have to care about the death of another black man if he was "just another criminal."         Not quite there. 42 with a younger wife. Still going strong.

It provides a connection to the food you eat, or the products that you use, that you don't get when just picking the shiniest thing off the grocery shelf, and many of these things are becoming further and further removed from our collective memory...(There was nothing on this list that was remarkable, I've made most of them myself at one point or another) and there may be a time where you find  yourself without power, or unable to reach a store, and being able to provide some basic comforts in that situation certainly will bring yourself some joy and contentment, don't you think?

I have changed my mind about my impression of employees based on comments from guests. I can't see it all, feedback is important.         Former server, Guest services manager checking in here.   The absolute worst waste of time in any servers night is when a table starts arguing about who is paying the check.   If you are the only one to sneak a card to the server, this LPT will work, but other people in your party may want to try the same thing, and this just leads to a clusterf**k tableside for any server. The best bet is to have this figured out early, or if unclear, split the check evenly. Most restaurants have an easy 5050 payment option at their CC terminals.  I will say that when one of my servers comes to me and complains that they have a table arguing over who is going to pay the bill, I tell them that our policy is to respect whoever submitted payment first (no such policy) so your early card may work.

I don't know exactly what you're looking for, but here are two of my favorite food bourn illnesses. Neither are germs, Anisakiasis is a parasitic infection, and CJD is a prionic disease, caused by a folded protein called a prion.  [Anisakiasis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anisakis#Anisakiasis) is a parasitic infection. You get it from improperly prepared fish that's infected with a nemtode. You can end up with bowel blockage from the resulting parasitic infection, sometimes requiring surgery to remove.  [CJD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creutzfeldt%E2%80%93Jakob_disease), or mad human disease, and other related neurodegenerative diseases. Similar to mad cow. Super scary because of these folded proteins called Prions, [which are notoriously hard to destroy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prions#Sterilization) compared to other pathogens, and the fact that they are not alive like a germ/microbe/virus, but are still able to create copies of themselves by folding other proteins. Can only be controlled by removing them from the food supply. Most institutional cleaning and cooking practices do not remove prions.           Actually, this is an infographic that  shows how just a few companies own all the products that are on your grocery shelves. [Check out this article from last year](http://gprl6105.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/media_consolidation.jpg) that explains how just a few companies own all the media that you consume.  There isn't one (or a few) companies that control everything, it's more about the loss of choice in the marketplace, no matter what product that you're talking about. [George Carlin does a great piece on the Illusion of Choice.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SC_wjQtfhZQ) NSFW, obviously, the specific part about choice starts around 3:30, but watch the whole thing anyway. It's great.  Edit: fixed link               Welcome. Good luck. Too many people out there take foodservice, and foodservice management specifically, as a bullshit job. It's not. To do it right takes an intensive skill set, both physical and mental, and looooong hours. But it has it's rewards.  The only thing else that I'll add, regarding down time, is learn to leave the job at the door. Set boundaries with staff and other management, and make sure that when you're off, you're off. That's your downtime, and it's terribly important.   I never make it that obvious, and I commend far more than I offer negative reinforcement. I can see how PNP suggestive correction can become Pavlovian, but only when the only time you receive positive reinforcement is when negative reinforcement is coming on the heels of it. I stay positive, and point out positive often, and when I have to offer negative correction, the PNP form just naturally follows. Better if I said always follow negative correction with positive reinforcement.    Assuming that you want to be successful, the first thing I will say is trying to keep everyone happy is a guarantee to fail. It's not your job to keep everyone happy, it's to keep everyone on task and working effectively.  Saying that, here's some advice from 20+ years service management.  * **Set goals**. Talk to your service staff, and explain clearly what the expectation is. Whether it's some small extra cleaning project, or a special you want mentioned, whatever it is, tell staff ahead of shift what your expectation is. Don't forget to set goals for yourself, and follow through on them.  *  **Follow up**. As you work through any shift, or any week, follow up on the goals that you have set. If you have asked servers to mention a new special at every table, take time to listen to each server and make sure that they are. If they aren't meeting the goals that you have set, ask them why. At the end of the shift, take time to point out with each server that you noticed them achieving the goals you set, or not, as the case might be.  *  **Don't get in the way**. You have to be proactive in your management of staff, but take care that you are not preventing them from getting the job done. You have been FOH so  you know you are there to make money. Don't lose respect by doing anything that can cost your servers time, because time is money.  * **Correct on site**. If you see something, say something. Be brief, but concise, when you need to correct behavior. *Take care not to do this in front of other staff, unless you see it as a teaching moment that other staff can benefit from. No one likes to be singled out.*  * **Be first, be last**. You are the first one on a problem, and you finalize the issue. If there's a spill, you're the first on task. That doesn't mean that you clean it up, it means you're the first one there, looking for a busser/utility to get mops/wet floor signs/towels, directing staff to handle problems. You finalize the problem by making sure everything is taken care of, signs put away, mop taken off the floor, and at the end of the shift, reinforcing your policies for how you want your staff to handle spills. (That's a small example, but be  first be last is really some of the best advice I can give you. Apply it to everything. You have to be the first to notice something, the first to handle something, and the last person to deal with it, to make sure it is handled the way you/your restaurant wants it to be handled. Follow up with staff about whatever incident it was, and then move on. Don't beat a dead horse.)  *  **Positive, negative, positive**. It's cliche, but when counseling an employee, remember this pattern. Tell them something that they do well, compare that to something that they don't do well, and encourage them to do better with positive thinking/acting/speaking. (Ex: If you have to talk about an employee's complete lack of pre-bussing tables, start with "You know what, employee? You might be one of the best upsellers in the house. But it would help all of us if you could be a little more mindful of prebussing. If you apply yourself to prebussing your tables like you do to upselling, you'll be the best at that too." Cheesy example, but it gets the idea across.)  * **Don't ask anyone to do anything you wouldn't do yourself**. And prove it occasionally.   * **No Down Time!** If you have free time, you haven't been planning correctly. Spend that time working on ideas, like staff comps, which are a great idea btw, or planning the next half of your shift, or your next shift, or your next week. Down time is your enemy. (It is important to take breaks occasionally, but breaks are different from down time.)  And lastly, if you truly want to be successful, you have to be the best. If you want your servers to be better cleaners, then you have to be the cleanest. If you want them to be quicker about greeting guests when they're sat, then you have to race them to the table. You can't just ask people to do things and expect that they will do them. You have to lead. And that's the hardest part. A leader leads, a boss bosses. Lead effectively, and they will follow. Boss, and they will resent you.   Oh, and remember to ask. It's your job to tell the server that he has to mop his section. It's his job to do what you tell him and mop his section. Neither of those facts should change human decency. Remember to ask the server to do what you want. If he doesn't, then fall back on the bossman routine. (I learned that lesson at 19 in QSR from a fifty year old woman that I didn't ask. She reminded me that we were both human, and I don't forget that, ever.)   Ham Wallet                         I would have had your back. The girl with the shot and no ID should have been put out immediately. And, if I couldn't find out which one of the other party gave her the shot, the rest would have been put out as well, unless one of them owned up and I could put him/her out specifically.  Side story: When working in a counter service restaurant in a college town about ten-fifteen years ago, I had one of my girls not ID during a sting. Good employee, almost friend, dumb mistake. I went with her through all the nonsense and meetings and court dates, just so I could get a real taste of what that's like. I will not put myself or my employees at risk at all because of that experience. Her experience cost her about three days work requested off for various meetings and court dates (About $100 bucks a shift), $250 in court fees/fines, six months probation with supervision costs at $25 a month = about a $700 mistake. (The house paid half, just cuz we were like that.)         Ummm, really? She might be guilty of making a bad decision but she's not at all guilty of her own rape.   Whenever you start to think about this sort of thing, put yourself in that situation, and think about it like a mugging. (They are not the same, let's just use that example.)  "If a dude drank too much and passed out at a party and a criminal mugged them, is the man 0% at fault?"  or if you prefer  "If you yourself drank too much and passed out at a party, and some dude fucked you in your ass while you were passed out, would you be 0% at fault?"  This idea states that a woman can never cut loose and have a good time at a party because she might drink too much, and if she passes out and gets raped, it's kinda a little her fault. That doesn't sound right, does it? It's the same argument that leads to people thinking that a short skirt is a reason for rape, or a bad neighborhood, or being flirty, or changing your mind about hooking up with someone.   The better question to ask here is why should a woman have to fear getting raped at some party? Throw better parties with better people. If she passes out at my party the worst that might happen is she'll be tucked in all safe and comfy in the guest bedroom without her permission.     I'm curious what you all think about this as well. My place is set up the same way, four-top only sections, six-top only sections, and tables for pushing. I look at the numbers, and they really seem to match-up fairly well. Turning for volume will net as much as a big party in sales, and depending on customers, tips seem about the same, but I have a pretty big disparity in what my servers prefer.               Yes, absolutely. We love allergy cards, and advance notice by phone or at the door. We actually work very hard on allergen awareness and safety, and we were way ahead of the curve in comparison to other restaurants. That's partially why it's so frustrating; to put so much hard work into something, and have it derailed by poorly informed individuals. We have a guidelines book where we talk about food allergens and our ingredients are broken down for each item on the menu across the eight common allergens, and have resources for the kitchen for the less common allergens. We have team members that are trained to "go to the book" to look up allergy information when a server or manager needs to know about less common allergies.   A perfect example of how this behavior puts people in danger is when we had a three top in the dining room, with one person claiming to be "allergic to gluten" (always introduce yourself as a Celiac first, then explain what that means to be taken seriously immediately) and one of the other guests claiming to be allergic to pepper. The server asked the gluten allergic customer whether it was an intolerance or Celiacs to determine whether cross-contamination would be an issue in her diet and was met with a blank stare and a comment along the lines of "I just can't have gluten"...she dismissed the table as "one of those" and followed our procedures for ingredient preferences as opposed to allergies. The second lady was served a steak, ordered without pepper, that was cross contaminated with pepper in the cooking process. I was doing FOH that night, and had to deal with the poor lady as her face began to inflate from her pepper allergy. Depressing to miss an easy opportunity for success when so much work is put into it.   This allergy shit is out of control. I know Oprah said it on her show, and I've seen it in magazines as well...in one of those sections like "Restaurant Life Hacks, Getting the Perfect Order Every Time!" or some such nonsense.    These damn near criminals suggest that if you don't want an ingredient in your dish that you tell your server that you are allergic to that ingredient, and that way they'll make sure that the ingredient is left out, because we don't want to kill anybody. Right?  These folks who wrote it, and all these customers who use this terrible advice every day don't understand that every time a story like /u/xnick58  happens, us BOH folks give just a slight shit less about the next time a server comes back there telling us that someone is allergic to something.  I've been in the business for almost thirty years now...in the last four years or so it's like there's been an outbreak of food allergy, of epic proportions! Why isn't this front page news? Apparently every blue hair in my city is fucking allergic to something, and none of those things are ever the eight commonest....it's always parsley or some such. Who the fuck is allergic to parsley! For fucks sake. And don't get me started on the gluten train.   These people don't get that there are people out there that have real food allergies. The kind where if you eat a certain kind of food, you might fuckin die! Not bad gas because you're dairy intolerant, but can't fuckin' breathe, my throat is closing up, holy shit I'm dying food allergies. I work as a safety/nutritionist/allergen supervisor for my restaurant and staff, and this shit is out of control. If anybody has any ideas for re-educating the dipshit public about this very serious issue, I'm all ears.   I love my wife dearly. She is my intellectual match, she shares my interests, a wonderful mother to our children, and creative and talented and all around wonderfully perfect.   She is also my filthy whore.   There doesn't have to be a disconnect between the two. The things that she does to me with her mouth and her kissing our children goodnight are just expressions of love. The hand I use to fist her is the same hand I hold my daughter's in when we cross the road, and I do both out of love.   Does the "Report Abuse" flag at the bottom link to Child Protective Services?   I have two dogs, a Black Lab/American Pitt mix and a long haired Chihuahua. Penelope, the Lab/Pitt, is a fat lazy thing. Black as night, and we call her Doggapotamus. Her theme song is the theme from Fat Albert. Persephone, the Chi, is an amped up little ball of lightning...not a yapper, but she either is asleep or tuned up to 11. Her theme song is the Benny Hill Song.            I loved the Rowdies growing up in the Tampa area! Would love to see them get developed. Because the Rowdies are....!   Jorts.     Sneakergazi. Or shoegate, if you prefer.     Hobby Lobby sells birth control? Since the decision, maybe you could consider some of the things that they sell as birth control. Like hangers. Or maybe you could just squirt some HodgePodge in your vag before having sex?      Nice. Another music worker! Yeah, if I get set up first, then get up, I can get a lot done. Also gives me "new ears" when I'm editing. (Cubase, FL, and others)   For me personally I find it's whatever I'm doing when I get high.  Sitting on the couch watching Cosmos, get high, do nothing else.  Working in my workshop, get high, don't want to stop for dinner.  Out and about with friends, I don't want the night to end.  I call it the Continuation Effect.                        Fun show. Four hours of silliness, TIL at the end of the show.   Yeah, me too. I was curious if anyone else had noticed/posted this. Was surprised to see no one mentioned it.      No, not sims, but great flight titles.    How about a re-release of N64's Rogue Squadron? Such a solid game, so much fun, would love to see it rendered in great graphics! So much want!      Turkey Lake at Bill Fredrick park. Not a true public course, the park has a fee for entering, minimal. Two full courses in park. Beautiful setting, nice challenge.   Yeah, rock probably a misnomer...but a interesting list anyway. Even if Spinal Tap got rated higher than Tommy.    There seemed to be a lot left out of this list. I've read a few of them, and they did make me laugh, but no Douglas Adams?                   Honestly, I would be too. That's why I'm delaying my decision. Just make sure that you guys are talking to each other about it.   Well, let me offer the dissenting opinion.  No matter what was talked about ahead of time, you have to respect the comfort level of your partner. If she is not comfortable with something, you can't ask her to do it out of a sense of fairness.  What needs to be talked about here, between you two, is the issue of how you're feeling. Not that she owes you, no matter what implied agreement came before. Additionally, you need to decide what you want in regards to future MFM encounters. If you like it, then do it because you and her like it, and are comfortable with it; not to accrue points that you can cash in for a FMF at a later date.  Go talk to her, tell her what you told us, and make decisions based on how the two of you feel, currently, as opposed to what's "fair".  My wife and I are exploring options in our sexual relationship, and adding a third is one of the things that we're talking about. She is comfortable with an additional male, but an additional female makes her uncomfortable, no matter what rules can be placed. One of the reasons that we have not moved ahead with this is not because of my comfort level (I'm okay with a variety of third-male scenarios), not because of a perceived one-way street of pleasure (it makes me very happy to see her receive pleasure. More can only be better). What concerns me is that she will agree to something that she is not comfortable with (FMF) for her because she perceives a lack of fairness in the situation, and tries something that she knows is wrong for her, and could jeopardize our relationship, and that is far more of an important issue than any other.   The goal here is to keep your SO happy and safe. Go forth with that in mind.                 Delicious.

 Good, sue their pants off.   I have a follow-up. 3 litres a day over some period of time is bad for you. But wouldn't 1 litre a day over a much longer period of time also be bad for you?   It'll be a class action settlement. Class members will get ~$5-20. Plaintiff's will get ~$5000. Lawyers will get $200,000. Nvidia will lose $1 million.    And mainly for money or "prestige."

Bullshit editorialized title. Ukraine may never have been serious about the ceasefire, but no way in Hell did the FM suggest that. He says they're preparing for full-scale war **because** Putin is crazy, not that they signed a ceasefire for shits and giggles...  "We see that they are not stopping," he says, suggesting the fight was now heading south to the port of Mariupol. "It doesn't take a genius to see what they are trying to do. They are taking more and more strategic points." The former ambassador was in the room during the attempts to broker a political solution with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Minsk. "Personally I don't trust him," he says. "You look at him and you think, 'Are you serious?'" "Nobody knows what is going on in his head. I believe he is becoming very emotional [over the two countries' historic ties]," he suggests, calling Putin's intentions "difficult to predict."   Same thing - in a lot of these smaller grocery stores, it makes sense for somebody to wait out and just get your order. The closest thing I've seen in the West is in the US convenience stores will close their doors at night but you can order through a bullet proof window - you still have to get out of your car so not as awesome. Also, more for security than comfort I suppose.   I came here to say just that. I've seen people fail lie detectors telling objective truths. I've seen people pass lie detector tests when telling objective falsehoods.   It should be like the American Civil War; even though the other side consisted of Confederates and had broken their oaths to the Union, they were still treated in a civil manner for the most part when captured, because they were still Americans.   You have a pretty [jolly view of American civil war era prisoner treatment...](http://www.esquire.com/news-politics/news/a25915/punishment-and-torture-in-the-civil-war-111413/)   According to what I've read, islamic law changes dramatically when a Caliphate is declared.  Islamic law isn't really affected by leaders, the legal precepts come from Muslim jurists. The basics of Islamic law fall into a spectrum of acceptable opinions (to mainstream Sunni Muslims) and deviations. A caliphate may pick and choose from different parts of the legal tradition, but they don't actually themselves have an effect on the law (in theory).   You get a lot of people to listen to your point-of-view ~~by~~ **in spite of** using vitriolic language like that?  If I'd met you in person, we might even get along and have an intelligent dialogue... But we didn't. And I'm legitimately sorry if my handful of uncivil opening remarks made you miss the point...  There's a regular generalization of this sub as a cess-pool of antisemitism due to suspicious posters (Indara-Varuna, etc.), deliberate and self-professed conspiritard trolls (Bip0lar bear, etc.) and the mouth-breathing basement dwellers working tirelessly to discredit the sub as a whole (duck_vimes, etc.). Your post, whether intentional or not, sets up a scarecrow argument, completely ignores the substance of the post made by the person you responded to and alludes to that absurd assertion of some sort of dominant anti-semetic trend across the sub.  Was I a dick? Sure - a blunt, a few beers and the blessing of relative anonymity don't bring out my best side. Does it take away from my 'point-of-view'? I don't think so.   Our policy has been largely successful, after we arrest these young people we bring a group of young scholars to engage in dialogue with them about their thoughts, and we succeed to bring a lot of them back from their radical ideas, he added.  Peace and dialogue are more effective tools to combat terrorism than blowing up thousands of people? Who the fuck would've thought...

Except Reddit is quite literally owned by a Jewish multi-billionaire...

Idiot. The OP asserted that there may be an Israel bias in administration at the site. The post you're replying to asserted that Reddit is presently owned by a Jewish billionaire. A majority of self-proclaimed Jews would identify with some sort of affinity or understanding towards Israel.  His post is an on point observation providing elucidating facts, yours is a desperate attempt to paint the presentation of facts as anti-semitism.   In my area, PDs have completely gotten *rid* of dash cams. It's fucked -   Some of em are - hear about the several cops that would place drugs on people they'd stopped? They had hand signals and everything.   Alleged petty criminals (usually poor people) don't typically go after the media outlets that paint them as monsters. Police departments however, can. In many ways given that reporters often depend on these guys for local stories.   Agreed. We need to stop having the cities dole out millions of dollars and start punishing the cops if we actually want change.   No - morally speaking, it's disgusting. Legally, not recording yourself committing a crime isn't akin to 'evidence tampering' (destroying evidence of your crime after the fact). Ipso facto, they can turn off the camera before beating someone senseless - but they can not destroy the tape in the event that they forgot to turn off the camera...though it's not like these tapes don't tend to go missing...   That's so incredibly fucked up especially given that these caffeinated beverages have the exact opposite effect on a person's hydration. I'm gonna be sick.   I can't think of a better reason to despise Castro, can you?  You despise Castro. We get that. I didn't take issue with that. I took issue with you painting a picture of *actual* Cubans by and large despising Castro with literally zero evidence.       Castro is (rightfully) despised by Cubans.  Use of the general implies a majority. We're to believe somebody who probably is, at best, an exile about the popular political currants mainland...right....

That's the only one that would truly end very tragically.   That is one of the worst videos I've seen on the internet.   Clearly you haven't seen 1 man 1 jar   He's Dutch - it's a Dutch accent.   Well, that's convenient.   It's not a reference to the original crusade. They call any Christian who opposes them a Crusader.    I'm not sure what do you mean by 'better'.  TBF - he's saying the new govt is better for non-Muslims since Morsi wasn't able to control the localized Copt/Muslim conflicts while the current govt is.   The reason the Japanese and Jordanian death created such an emotional reaction was because they made us first think there was hope for their survival. That there was an exchange. Its like a plot twist to make us angry.   TBF, there actually is always hope for survival. They're like any other criminal gang, when the price is paid, they've let go of hostages in numerous cases (more times than they've killed hostages). In the case of Jordan, you might not be aware that during negotiations, Jordan allegedly ran a (failed) operation to save the hostage. I have a feeling that played a substantial role in what took place. As a specific example, you might note that the American woman they were holding hostage (who died in a Jordanian operation post execution of the pilot) explicitly mentioned her peers being freed (they delivered that letter we all saw).  Currently they're holding a fuck-ton of Peshmerga as hostages and they're in talks about a trade with the Kurds. I'm willing to bet that those Peshmerga hostages will get traded for the ISIS hostages being held by the Kurds as the Kurds don't have that same mentality of 'we don't negotiate with Terrorists' and though our (US) advisers will probably discourage it, they'll make the deal to save their loved ones.   They are obviously still upset about the previous crusades though.  I don't think so, there's plenty of modern issues to be upset about. The use of 'crusade' is entirely symbolic, the same way Bush referred to it as a 'Crusade' on one occasion as have other Christians in the military. It's not a reference to the original Crusade which no Christian I've known is particularly proud of - just a symbolic phrase.  They are always talking about killing the Pope and conquering rome.  Killing the pope? That's a mistranslation at best - what video did they say that in? When these guys reference "ar-Rum", it's not a reference to Rome proper in Italy or to the Vatican - it's historically been a general reference to "The West". Today - it's a reference to US hegemony / NATO / Allied powers. It's like when in medieval times, Europeans referred to Muslims as "Saracens" - it didn't mean the Saracens proper but Muslims in general.  My two cents - If we want to know what these people's grievances are objectively (something we need to do if there's ever going to be a lasting peace), I don't think its smart to write things off as an 'age-old' desire for revenge. In their statements, they don't say they're avenging the barbarity of the old Crusades - like ever. They particularly speak about activity that took place over the last 50 years and certain conditions that persisted into the modern age.   Wow, so they killed all these people just because some lady was forced to go back to the Christian church? Don't they do this shit all day in Saudi Arabia?  She was also [purportedly tortured at some point.](http://www.thecairopost.com/news/137567/uncategorized/sisi-egypt-has-right-to-respond-to-is-execution-of-egyptians-in-libya)   They could probably actually have some sort of Islamic State if they weren't so psychotic.  Yea - probably. Doesn't seem like the end game of the leadership though.  I love how obsessed ISIS is with the crusades. I wonder if they realize that most of the western world doesn't even care about the pope. They can't get over some event that happened like 800 years ago.  When they talk about Crusade, they're referring to modern wars - not the actually Crusades or Papal authority.     I'm surprised this isn't receiving much attention.  I'm not.   It has something to do with the ice-grip they've got on our balls.   even the cats over there aren't shocked by the senseless violence anymore.   Yea because the media always puts out speculative news pieces about motive only after a jury convicts several years after an incident.....   Gotta kill as many civilians as possible before the ceasefire comes into effect! Get with the program!   It has now - because people campaigned for it....it didn't get picked up by any mainstream outlet till 14 hrs after the fact....   was there some evidence that it was motivated by their religion?  Testimony of the father of a victim (ignored by police), the fact that he executed 3 people for the parking dispute with one person (the driver), other inconsistencies with the police insistence that this is just a simple parking dispute and thats that etc.   No - they haven't. They hit mainstream media after the hashtag campaign - CNN (the first mainstream outlet to pick it up) did so 14 hrs after the fact. The comparison is being made to the recent Ottawa killing, or the axe-attack, etc. One type of issue (this one) was getting no attention and even later, only sanitized reporting, while the others were dramatic, immediate and full-day without a massive public campaign....

Not surprising. A guy flew a plane into an IRS building. I don't recall it even making national news at the time. There have been Mosque arsons, unexploded bombs, etc. in the past as well with no coverage.   The police have the shooter in custody, so he's not a threat anymore.  Ah yes, that's why it isn't making front page. Once somebody is arrested, its not news anymore. Got it.

So are you saying you should be allowed to marry your same-sex lover but not your cousin lover?   Ah - that's how I always imagined female gamers. Thanks for the confirmation!   There was an article about attacks on Mosques in Europe and some American made the comment that over here everything will be fine.  Inna lillahi wa inna illayhi rajioon   And he's got hick in his name..   It's not "tolerant" of other beliefs to deny Christ's statement that he is the only way to Heaven (as attributed to him in the Bible) - it's just denial of canon...   As a rule - yes. But Muslims can't say "so and so" non-Muslim is in Hell. Islam differentiates between a general statement ('anyone who commits shirk goes to the fire') vs a specific statement about an individual (so and so is in the fire because so and so committed shirk).   It's pretty obvious Jordan killed her accidentally. If ISIS did it - they would have a well-produced twisted video of it. Their story is pretty believable in this situation.   It is. The issue is that media is selective in "trying to understand". In certain cases, no such attempt is made and a rush to conclusions is the drivel you generally get. In other cases, there is an "attempt to understand".   It's appropriate for the US to supply cold war era weapons for the new cold war.   But that doesn't make for good TV!   I'm afraid you're just an idiot and this is an urban myth concocted by little hicks with too much free time, internet and a nominal understanding of Islam. Being "tainted" with pigs blood doesn't make it impossible for a Muslim to be martyred (according to Islam). All it does is affect the living (making them ritually unclean requiring them to wash up before prayer).   They were suspended. Which suggests anonymous didn't actually take them down, Twitter did.   Yes, but they won't use abc123 as a password anymore if Anonymous really took down a bunch of these accounts as is being claimed.  What's interesting is several of the accounts I looked at aren't even ISIS. Just your regular old zealots.   The Tanakh is clear Sodom was destroyed for inhospitality.  BS - it's clear from any objective read that the issue here was homosexuality, as it was clear to the Jews and their sages, who historically interpreted the story as a basis for the prohibition of male homosexuality.   That's not true, she gave a positive report on the mosque she was *actually* suppose to be at. Seems she had a legit misunderstanding here.   Conspiracy theories get a bad rap - but you'd be surprised how many former 'conspiracy theories' get demonstrated true 50 years later.

Thats the attitude of a fraudster and a thief. There should be, and used to be, morality in business. Doing business on a handshake used to be a real thing.   The Native Americans who weren't outright robbed and evicted were tricked into selling land [through legal but immoral agreements](http://www.ericfoner.com/reviews/020906lrb.html). You're lying to yourself if you think your ancestors ever had any real honor in business. Michael Cosculleuela isn't something new, he's the product of centuries old depravity.   That was my immediate thought. My follow-up thought was that the people likely to break the law in retaliation to getting butt-fucked like this are the untethered single individuals with few future prospects in life and no dependents. Which leads me to believe that the people these guys are screwing over tend to be the exact people who can't retaliate - people with families that will just need to get over it, move on and get screwed by someone else in the near future.   You're wasting your time.   no doubt - worth a shot tho   I actually do use armor all - and you're right and all but you guys have a shit approach to dealing with SMM it seems. We might be able to come to an arrangement though (I have plenty of examples in portfolio as well - PM me)   You don't know what set that off though. They didn't just do that out of being sore losers.   Who would we hire in his place? He made one terrible, terrible call. But he was behind a lot of the unconventional calls that got us to this point. Are we gonna hang the man out to dry for a handful of terrible calls when he's delivered on more?   It's actually...kind of possible - hopefully the idiot gtfo.   That's not really true though. Content surrounding conspiracy theories that were massively upvoted have often been proven correct (Israeli military training of US police forces, widespread domestic spying, use of tools by police to intercept cell-phone data, police provocation at protests,...and this current thread). There's bound to be plenty of non-sensical threads with 10-20 upvotes or what-not, but if you go through the wayback machine and simply compare the most upvoted content against later determined facts, it doesn't seem to be a sea of crazy.   Why isn't there more on Mo from these unbiased sources?  Most of the tribes in Arabia at the time converted to Islam, within Muhammad's life time and the succeeding generations. If everybody is on your team by the time you die - then all sources that talk about you would logically be 'biased' sources no?  There is some material from biased non-Muslim sources as well - you can start [here](http://www.islamic-awareness.org/History/Islam/Inscriptions/earlysaw.html) and then consult the voluminous literature around the early community used in the references.   Every historical report in recorded human history then is just hearsay...  Ahadith are just saying attributed to the man, there's way of verifying the credibility of reports. Kinda like what historians do....   Doesn't prove they know they had blocked the driveway at the time of parking...it proves they logically deduced that they had possibly blocked the driveway (the only plausible reason their vehicle would've disappeared other then being stolen).   lolwtf Edit: Just checked Urban dictionary - it totally think dabs got something to do with bikes trippy    they see you as the one that did that to them, and they know where you live.

Here's some old information on porno spying:  http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/11/26/nsa-porn-muslims_n_4346128.html  People forgot about this no doubt.   And if you say anything now, not covered by the leaks, they'll still slam you for it until you're proven incontrovertibly right. Then they'll come up with excuses for it.

Not 100 lashes in Saudi Arabia:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4r_izRZYLw   He is putting effort into it - he's doing exactly what Saudi/Islamic law permits for lashing (90 degree arm angle maximum, not striking the same spot twice in a row, no more than 100 at a time, no breaking the skin, etc.)   Flogging in Saudi Arabia is always public. It would be very difficult to list it as suicide. It also doesn't depend on who's doing it (in Saudi Arabia) since all the administrators need to follow the same rules.   The king doesn't directly control the judiciary.   You're thinking of the wrong kind of lashes. These are lashes in accordance with Saudi law:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4r_izRZYLw   It's 10x the amount given out per session. But they're not administered at once, he'll see 50 per week.   1000 lashes like this:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4r_izRZYLw  Spread out over the course of 50 per week.   Those *are* the norm for Saudi Arabia. That's literally all the lasher is allowed to do (90 degress, no hits on the same spot twice in a row, not allowed to break skin, etc.)   [It's not as bad as you think](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4r_izRZYLw) - you'd probably easily be able to take one.   I think [you'd be fine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4r_izRZYLw)   You're thinking of Singapore canings. This is what Saudi lashing looks like:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4r_izRZYLw   No. His lawyer argued that he needed it put off while his family wrote to the press. His lashing was identical:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4r_izRZYLw  And all the lashings in Saudi Arabia follow the same guideline (the administrator of the punishment is subject to the courts for overdoing the religious restrictions on how its to be done).   It's not, Islam stipulates rules for lashings. Here's Badawi's punishment for the week of Jan 9th:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4r_izRZYLw   true:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4r_izRZYLw   As somebody else clarified - I should've said twice in a row.  I got caned two strokes at school for splitting someones lip and the bloody housemaster managed to cross the strikes being the sadistic fuck he was.  your experience was probably a bit different from this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4r_izRZYLw   A forum for gay minors. So...'An underage boys gay site.'   Much of the rest of the world, beyond the Americas and Europe is pretty "anti gay". Historically, much of the West was also "anti gay". Times change of course   He is alleged to have specifically and seriously libeled one of two of the major academic institutions of Saudi Arabia - there's a reason CNN will mention the flogging but you won't find anyone actually discussing the blog posts. The change he (and some other young Saudis like him) was petitioning for is increased secularization, but more importantly, an overhaul of the academic and judicial system in Saudi.  By making this a big international issue (which is what he and his family have been doing - since seeking asylum - through the medical claim, etc.) - the regime will have to step in and over-rule the judiciary. The hope is (in addition to his case being overturned) that there will be a precedent set for greater 'freedom of expression', that will include being allowed to make the sort of claims he did about Saudi establishments.  An unintended consequence though is that an action by the ruler in favor of Badawi could stoke tensions within the kingdom. In Islamic law, there has always been a seperation between the judicial system and the executive role. So when Muslim leaders had a dispute with the populace, they had to be judged by an independent third party. When a judge has a dispute with a citizen, they go to another judge. And religion, in theory, places enough fear in the judges from taking sides because so-and-so is a peer or a friend.  You can see exactly what 'lashes' are in Saudi Arabia as somebody snuck a camera during his Jan 9th lashing. Unless he has some sort of critical condition, at 32 years of age, he can definitely take the caning and did just fine during his first lashing. Regardless of what we might think about the Saudi judicial system [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcYK3xqcAEY) isn't exactly some kind of tortuous punishment. It's arguably a lot less painful than some of the things that happen in our own penitentiaries.  And the administrators of corporal punishment in Saudi Arabia also have rules to abide by so it doesn't actually get more 'brutal' than this. You can't go more than 90 degrees with your arm, you can't hit the same spot twice in a row, you're not allowed to break the skin, etc. The shame associated with the punishment has a more powerful effect (except for this guy) then the physical aspect.  That said, I'm not saying I agree with happened - just clarifying that the images most people have of these punishments outside of Muslim circles is more based on surreal superstitions and hypotheses absent actual context. Hopefully that was helpful.   just that as Jesus said, let he who has not sinned cast the first stone.  Hate to be that guy - but Jesus didn't actually say that. The popular passage was actually a centuries later interpolation (and that's if we can truely regard much of the Bible what 'Jesus said')   You might. Saudis don't (look at their crime rate), they also have other dissuading factors like shame.   It's in the comments slightly above. It's interesting though how many people without any knowledge of Islam or Saudi law jump (reasonably) to the same false conclusion that you did.   Maybe his really were brutal?  They probably weren't and medically he's probably fit. But you don't create social change by being honest to gullible foreigners.   Saudis are the barbarians while we send kids to get their ass pounded.    there might be much worse approaches, depending on the crime and person.  There isn't. You don't go more than 90 degress and you don't hit the same spot twice. Only thing to make it worse would've been if he had to take his shirt off (which is plausible).   He still has really bad scars on his back almost 20 years later and told me it was fucking excruciatingly painful FAR worse than you'd imagine.  Lashes are different depending on where you go. In Saudi Arabia, they aren't (technically) allowed to pull their arm all the way back and then lash. They aren't allowed to go more than 90 degress. So he wouldn't die, or even scar - its more about slight pain and plenty of humiliation.   Oh, well that's not too trippy - I guess you lucked out, I've seen some weird shit.   Open the ta'weez and see what is written inside (assuming you're Desi). You may be in for an unpleasant surprise.   It's comical. Unless you're American. Than it just becomes sad.   That explanation would work for why Miami and NY cater to a Jewish base. It doesn't go anywhere to explain even an iota of what's been going since [documentation at least as early as the tenure of former congressman Findley.](http://www.amazon.com/They-Dare-Speak-Out-Institutions/dp/155652482X)   Excellent post.   Banging on the fear drum and the isolation drum like a rabid monkey.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giaZnIr-faM   Read the book 'They Dared to Speak Out' (by a former US state rep). The Israeli lobby has had American politicians by the balls for decades.   Shhhhh   You can't blame Bibi for trying - not like we haven't been doing their bidding for years.   and the torture  Interestingly, besides the senate report on torturey stuff that we've done - the Extremists aren't actually known for torture. There's no veritable evidence, or propaganda video by them where they actually torture someone. Our allies have plenty of videos like that (the Iraqi army), but the other crazy guys don't.   sure   Muslims believe it's real. Muslims also believe in angels, so this thing isn't really a stretch.  If we suppose that Muhammad fabricated the entire incident though, it's a bit interesting that he would choose an insignificant sounding animal the size of a 'mule' and not something a little cooler like a dragon.   Well he didn't actually get to lead a rebellion against Yazid, even if that was his intention. He was killed before that was even a plausible possibility.   Those are just artist renderings. But Muslims do believe that during isra, there was an animal called Buraq which the Prophet rode.   Sure - just don't say it in public out of respect for the living who suffered under some of those rulers. Pray for them all you want in private.   The people in charge need another old figurehead. May God forgive the Kings.   There actions are still documented...the Islamic pov is just not to insult/attack people when they're dead.   No. He was Muslim for all intents and purposes. There is no veritable evidence for takfir.   IT IS HARAM TO REBEL AGAINST **MUSLIM** RULER. Those are words of Prophet Muhammad!  100% agree with the statement, you respect the ruler even if he's a Khariji Muslim who took power by force. But as for Assad - He's a Rafidi, and an Alawi Rafidi to boot...  I dare you. Go and make revolution in USA or Morocco and see how government will react. YOU WILL BE KILLED too if you will fight the government with froce.  So you're telling me if a group of people took up positions, with weapons and threatened government officials in the USA or Morocco, those leaderships would annihilate that entire group of people (women and children and all) - for the sake of shutting down one rally? And then allow the country to be torn apart by civil war?   If a significant portion of an ethnic population in your country ascribed itself to a particular religion, in exclusion to the religion of your own majority ethnic group, and you attacked the icons of their religion (and thereby them) - it's not a leap to draw racism, and at the least, xenophobia...  By your logic, most Stormfront material wouldn't even be racist since apparently in order to implicate racism we need something explicit only.   Terrorist attacks are not logical, sorry.  Sorry, you're an idiot. He's saying it's logical for the perps to be Muslim in Muslim countries given that Muslims are the majority in Muslim countries. It's statistics - but you might want to start with a more basic use of numbers before we journey into the world of probabilities and what-not.  	140
 If they were to cancel it, I would want CBS to let the creators give the show a proper send off and finish off all the story points. However I don't want the show to end because it's just too good, hopefully Netflix picks it up and ups the budget (one can dream, can they not?)   Can you remember his main criticism of the film?      Cool thanks guys!   So throughout the series, corporations are obviously a big part of the game and in Human Revolution they go into greater detail of these different corporations, which i'm guessing are loosely based of real life corporations who have monopolies in certain markets.   1. Tai Yong Medical, could we align them to real life companies like Pfizer or Glaxo Smith Kline?  2. Picus Media, perhaps they are based off News Corp, Comcast, Viacom?   2. Belltower Associates, this one is pretty straightforward as we can attribute them security contractors like Academi (formally known as Blackwater) or DynCorp  3. Sarif Industries, This one for me is harder to pinpoint, it seems to be an amalgamation of different real life companies put into one company. Maybe Boston Dynamics or maybe Cyberdyne (yes that is the real name of a Japanese robotics company, I am worried).  What do you guys think, I may be completely off here.    This, from what I gathered in my play-through, Sarif Industries were more on the cutting edge of augmentations than their competitor, Tai Yong Medical which were known for making more generic/cheaper augmentations that weren't as reliable.    Hey there visiting Singapore next week for a few days, I was thinking of watching the Avengers there since it releases the day I leave Sydney on the 23 April. Would the movie have subtitles on the whole film and would it be censored in any form? Also where is the best cinema to watch it?  Thanks   Damn that looks nice, I think it saw it during the day last time, never to to see it at night, will definitely check it out, thanks!   Hey guys I am visiting from Sydney, Australia and I will be arriving on the 23 April and checking the place out for a few days, can anyone recommend a place to take some good photos, especially at night time (neon lights etc). Last time in Singapore I only had a day to check out the city, so this time I will be able to venture around a bit more.  Cheers.    So will we see Malick in Mankind Divided? Is it canon that she dies in Human Revolution? Be cool if you can make some quick decisions before Mankind Divided (like Mass Effect 2) and those decisions affect the story and characters in MD.    I truly do wonder if we will get to see Hengsha again in MD. Or maybe upper Hengsha, since that was already planned before it got cut.   He means [HBO Now](https://order.hbonow.com/), which is a subcription based service (no cable proivider needed). At the moment it is only available on the USA iTunes/Apple TV.    All of my Driveclub ones are taken as the menu fades in lol, is there anyway to turn the screenshot option off?   There's still a chance he may direct this if his one doesn't work out.    I thought Tress FX in Tomb Raider worked quite well, especially on my R280X, the only issue with the game was that it was only Lara's hair which had Tress FX while every other character in the game had the standard hair which looked even worse in comparison.    Sorry but I have to disagree, just because HBO's subscription method is a bit much (although they are releasing a standalone subcription only service soon), the quality of content they produce is still unsurpassed, no other network makes shows as remotely close to quality and production as Game of Thrones, The Wire, Sopranos, Boardwalk Empire. Those are just a few shows as well. If they were to budget this show like Game of Thrones than you would probably see the most realised vision of Rapture or Infinite on television.    Glad to see they are making a sequel, although the story for the first one was generic, the racing itself was amazing. Awesome camera-work with minimal CG.    Great idea, didn't think of this. Lends itself much better to TV this way than a straight up adaptation.    Gonna miss these guys, I never got to see them live :(   Hopefully Daft Punk will be able to score Tron 3 since they have finished their work on Random Access Memories.    So the film adaptation for Bioshock 1 got shut down a while ago now, how do you guys think the story of Bioshock 1 or Inifite would work as a TV series? Ideally it would be awesome to have a HBO budgeted series but I can understand the high risk involved with that. If it was Bioshock 1, should it be set before the events of the first game and show Rapture's downfall? Or do you guys think Bioshock Infinite's overall story lends itself to a television series better?    I guess some people prefer the convenience of being able to move have it on tablets/laptops without the hassle of discs, however for me the Blu-Rays are more than perfect due to the audio and video fidelity.    Can someone explain how they score the music to the film playing on the projector?   Quantum of Solace also had a cool opening chase, it's a shame the rest of the film didn't hold up as well though.    This is what I believe as well, makes sense as GG are going to focus on their new game and potentially turn it into a franchise, hope it's great as they are a very talented group, who have unfortunately been relegated to making Killzone titles since the PS3 launched. With the writer of Fallout NV, I do have high hopes for the story of Horizon.    It auto mutes the music for me in Driveclub, I have also heard it does it in Bloodborne as well.    I actually haven't seen this played before any films, at least in my theatre, is it because it is too intense?   It's kinda strange because that soundtrack must have been ahead of its time for that type of film, back then people may not have been able to comprehend not having a conventional orchestral score in a heist type of film, Tangerine Dream also did the score for GTA V and sounds very similar to Thief [Here's an example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MKvsXA94Zk).    Curious as to what you liked about 2 over 1?   I think the 2014 noses were by far the worst I have seen.    I love this one in particular for the splash of red and the pattern it forms around the car, it's a shame that Toyota weren't more successful in F1 considering how much money they put into it:( I'm also a big fan of the sail fin era, gave the cars a more futuristic look in my opinion.       What type of spider is this?   3576142   Bioshock 1 written into a good movie with a talking protagonist. Which then ties into a Bioshock Infinite film.       She had like a 3 second cameo after Letty wins the race at the start of the movie.    Man this guy does not deserve the POS car Red Bull have this year, he deserves so much better.   So basically if a human had sex with a female twi-lek could it produce offspring?    The pacing felt a bit off and the end action sequence felt a little uninspired and ran too long, but other than that I enjoyed it for what it was considering that it went through a pretty big reshoot after Paul's death. The ending for the film was really nice and fitting. Nicely ties off the series with these characters.    To be fair Azog's CGI is pretty damn impressive as well, it's just shame that it's only him and Smaug that look good while everyone else looks passable at best.    Well then there could be the case of BF4 where because they didn't really have a proper closed/open beta before release, the game ends up suffering and takes a full year to fix.    I feel they should have gone makeup instead of CG on Azog. Manu would have really gotten the ability to show off his acting in that capacity.    Driveclub muted the music for me. At least the main menu music as I already had the racing music option turned off.    The only ones I own are GTA V and The Last of Us. For me both of those games are what a HD Remasters should strive to be.    I think it's too early to say, yes Fernando must be feeling very bad about having to retire, especially since he was in a good position, however he is also smart enough to have foreseen that a great deal of work will be required to make this car into a magnificent car. It will take time, it won't be easy but I have a feeling the struggle will be worth it.    Do you guys think that FO4's main character should have a voice or be silent like previous entries? I see an upside and downside to this.   Upside: Greater character development and more immersive for the player (at least for me).   Downside: More voice work will limit the amount of dialogue choices and the character may not be likeable for every player.   What do you guys think?   So people have answered with the usual responses. I think for a much more recent teaser, the Spectre teaser really is awesome. So little is revealed about the film yet it manages to totally keep you engaged and guessing.    I've seen a motorbike here in Sydney with the license plate of Bort as well.    Paracel Storm in night would make an interesting map.    Who is the guy in the back? I don't remember him at all.   I don't think Admiral Ackbar would be considered a "extremely minor character", right?    [Fembot](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/44/Fembots_2_APIMOM.jpg)   Man I loved that guy. He always put a smile on my face, really uplifting dude.    Would Bossk and IG-88 be considered minor characters anymore since they got fleshed out in EU material?    I think it's because Pete is a major douche nozzle so it didn't bother me as much. I didn't think of GOT until OP reminded me haha   Easily a [Chiss](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Chiss). Blue skin and red eyes, I think I could make that work.    I'm hoping to see [death stick guy](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Elan_Sel%27Sabagno) again. I want to see if he re-thunk his life.    You can always mute it and put your own music.   I wonder how long that Maybach has been sitting there.    WHY did you have to bring up that traumatic experience OP?   It's too bad she was a fembot the whole time :(   They weren't attempts, as they were very successful.    [Mozambique Drill](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mozambique_Drill) is what Cruise did on the second hostile.    Fucking agent smith, I love this gif so much.   Damn haha, well here in Sydney it's a different story it's speed camera central. Just this morning I was driving through a road close to the city which had two red light speed cameras one set of lights apart.    Seriously?   Ah man I remember hearing original version of this song when I was very young, still stuck with me to this day. Still holds up and still means a lot to me.    Doubt it, since Sony is the publisher of the game, the chances of it happening are nil.   I don't play the game that often but why the hell is it updating every single day? Also not to mention it takes ages to actually apply the update since it's writing to disk all the time.    A question to people who avoid trailers, what exactly do you do when they show the trailer when you are watching a film in the cinema?   What spoilers were there in the Interstellar trailer? All I gathered from the trailers was that the earth was slowly dying and the main character had to go into space to try save it.    I have always liked [this tune](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ISrDM3hZYM) he did for Harry Potter Deathly Hallows Pt II. Dude's talented glad he has the opportunity to score a Star Wars film!   Everyone was pretty lukewarm on it since they first announced it. Not to mention it's a full launch price for a game that looks like it could have been sold as DLC.    The Tron Legacy one is my favourite. Seeing that logo appear the first time was awesome.    Haha believe me I know, I'm an example.   I did not expect that asian anchor to have that accent.    Pretty sure The Grey tops all of these.   I think the main issue with that is post procedure you may not be able to wear a helmet for a while...which may impede on his ability to race lol   This must have been quite excruciating for the actors to sit through, but the end product is perfect.    So I watched the first season of the show and seemed to enjoy it for what it was however I did watch it though when nothing else was on so it was rather a distraction until everything else started back up again. I was wondering how the second season is? Is it worth reinvesting the time to watch the show again?   To be fair I have been making use of the usb music feature for that until Spotify arrives.   Bond's Aston Martin DB5...*I need it*   Haha these were taken at least a year or 2 ago when I was still at uni, it was more of a thing to show my friends since it always happened to be in the same area.   Yep   2003 one wasn't terrible though in my opinion, I still found it enjoyable.    There are some mysteries in the universe that can never be explained.       I agree! I still find the second film to be quite good, just had quite a lot to live up to since it's a sequel to one of the greatest animes ever made.    Well fans were just being rowdy because because it was an offside goal by the Wanderers which led to the keeper and his own player running to each other I believe. Fans thought they were faking it.   Another great anime scene is the [Hong Kong scene from Ghost in The Shell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB-ik-Bpl0c). In my opinion it is more beautiful and shows off the true hand crafted nature of anime.    Yep it is. [The character of Billy Batts getting done by Joe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzqZNRVIQpM)   I was at this game and there was lots of booing from the crowd and then it slowly subsided after 10 minutes as everyone probably realised it was more serious. I was surprised at how long it took for them take him away on the stretcher, guessing they had to fully assess the extent of the damage?   Before anyone else says them.  These are Directors cutstheatrical Kingdom of Heaven Directors cut  Blade Runner Final Cut (I don't think it's even possible to get a hold of the theatrical release any more?)  Aliens Directors Cut  Terminator 2 Directors Cut        Loving flood on the floor, great track in my opinion.    I think it's quite easy to hate the headlight design but for me because it's quite different to all the super edgy designs we have now, I do indeed find it quite refreshing and can see it growing on me quickly.   I'm really digging the new Purity Ring album!   Yeah I don't see why they couldn't. They are talented and most likely be scooped up quite quickly if they aren't already independent.    There probably will be another Alien Isolation just under a different publisher, I'm guessing that once the licence expires Sega won't renew it and someone else will step in. It's too big of a licence for it to just be stagnant, especially with a new film on the horizon.    He actually became a bit of a bro towards the end of Dawn of the Dead, douche at the beginning, bro at the end.    So I just finished Alien Isolation for the first time and one thing that stood out was the Japanese translation on signs in Sevastpol station, now I know that a lot of sci-fi works use Japanese lettering, but why is this the case? Don't get me wrong it looks really cool, I remember seeing it in Alien on the self-destruct box as well, just curious is all.    Bear in mind that James Cameron back when he was filming Aliens didn't nearly have the same pull as he does now. Now that he has two of the highest grossing box office films Fox are just letting him take his sweet ass time with the Avatar sequels.    Same here, really loved Prisoners, I have yet to watch Enemy but I have heard good things. A proper Aliens sequel and Blade Runner sequel announced in the same year, what year is this?!      Gone Girl, you know which scene.   Alien Colonial Marines which was unfortunately a terrible game.   Damn I thought Jap cars were pretty good here in Australia but NZ sounds a lot more relaxed with the laws.    Also is it implied that it's Sebastian who was helping Nikola during Galahad's recovery? Maybe he faked his death?(even though it seems pretty difficult).   I don't understand what really differentiates this from a top of the line S65 AMG long wheel base?   Personally I am rooting for the P1. Ever since I played Need for Speed II all those years back, the Mclaren F1 has and still is my favourite super car ever made and the P1 reminded me of the F1 just in it's sheer ridiculousness. My other pick would be the 918 since that car is pushing the hybrid technology forward the most out of the 3 also I feel that it looks a ton better than the La Ferrari.   La Ferrari is the last one for me since I always feel that Ferrari are always up themselves in terms of how they present their brand. Don't get me wrong they make great cars however how the way they present themselves to motor journalists and car enthusiasts, just turns me off them. I know I didn't really analyse from a technical POV which would come first, this is just who I want to come first.    Are you suggesting that Ferrari actively track where each car is at any given time?   Ah right TIL  	112
    Food Finder is a bit different to Foursquare in that I want to make it ridiculously easy to find amazing food. Which is why City Mapper, Google Street view and soon Uber have been integrated directly into the app.  Also, you may notice that there are no ratings and only one short review on Food Finder. This is because Food Finder is highly curated and only contains amazing restaurants.               How did you find this?   Check it out!  http://www.GroupPay.io     	9
                   Look......... there goes the joke         but maybe       prop maybe?

 To achieve the American dream all you need is hard work and a billionaire friend to provide financial assistance.    Mr. Braman and aides to Mr. Rubio have declined to say how much personal financial assistance he has provided to Mr. Rubio and his wife, directly or indirectly, but it appears to total in the hundreds of thousands of dollars.  Does anybody else think this might cast a shadow on Marco Rubio's up from the working class story?        Mansplain your conservative political views to me.   I was hoping Obama was going to seize it and give in back to Mexico.  'Sorry, turns out we didn't need this. More trouble than it's worth. Except for Willie Nelson. We'll be keeping him.'   Fortunately there's no charge to not sit next to a member of Congress while not attending a Taylor Swift concert.   In all fairness to Walker, giving corporations cash was the important part of the equation.    Good article, but the huge amounts of outside and dark money being spent on the 2016 campaign are a wild card. No one really knows how much that's going to influence the results in contested states.   He just wanted to show that anyone can succeed in America!!  It just takes hard work!! And some insider information and the willingness to skirt the law!1   Good news.  But since we have about 3 decades of wage stagnation to recover from, don't get overly excited.   The GOP loves local control!  Except when local governments do something that they don't like.   Cardiologists actually make [rather more than 250K](http://www.forbes.com/sites/jacquelynsmith/2012/07/20/the-best-and-worst-paying-jobs-for-doctors-2/2/), and I imagine the cardiologists in NYC make more than the average.   You can start with [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpKB6OZ_B4c).   Scott Walker - Ending Wisconsin's Tradition of Fine Public Education !!  I'm offering him this slogan for his own use, free of charge.   All the King's Men by Robert Penn Warren. No book, fiction or non, tells a better story about how American politics work.  Empire of Liberty by Gordon S. Wood, about the first years of the Republic, is the best for early American politics.  Turns out much of today's political conflict goes back to the nation's start.   It would help if we started making clearer the ties between campaign financing and the actions of politicians.  Somehow it's considered impolite in mainstream media to point that, to pick a particularly execrable politician , James Inhofe the Senate's leading climate change deniers, and how much of his [campaign funding](http://maplight.org/us-congress/legislator/576-jim-inhofe) he receives from oil and gas and electric industries.    Repeat until understood.   'Politically driven science' being 'science we disagree with'.   Well, most of them are pretty smart.   Wisconsin is one of the states where the middle class is disappearing the [fastest](http://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/blogs/stateline/2015/3/19/the-shrinking-middle-class-mapped-state-by-state), and these nitwits are spending their time micromanaging food stamps benefits. Way to address the important issues guys.      Ryan said he has strong concerns that reining in campaign spending could have a "chilling effect" on free speech. **If donors had to disclose their identities when they gave to charitable groups or some nonprofits, he fears that individuals could be retaliated against for expressing themselves politically.** "I see an attempt to infringe on First Amendment rights, to give some people more tools to harass citizens from participating in democracy and expressing themselves, and I don't think that is a good thing," Ryan said during a Christian Science Monitor breakfast Thursday morning.  Ryan is telling us the first amendment is supposed to protect you from being harassed if you express your opinion?  Novel interpretation.     If we invest in green energy and makes a few tweaks to how we consume energy and dispose of waste, energy can be far cheaper, cleaner and more abundant in the future.  That's the argument we should be making for getting off the carbon.  Continuing to rely heavily on fossil fuels is holding us back from cheaper energy.     William James thought there were [3 steps](http://quoteseverlasting.com/quotations/2013/06/19/6792/a-new-idea-is-first-condemned-as-ridiculous-and-then-dismissed-as-trivial-until-finally-it-becomes-what-everybody-knows-william-james/) each new idea goes through. I'd say Charles Koch is trying out stage two.   I say Walsh is speaking gibberish, but I don't think it reaches that level.   Rand Paul blamed Eric Garner's death on [cigarette taxes](http://www.cnn.com/2014/12/03/politics/rand-paul-eric-garner-taxes/).  You might want to start considering, just a wee little, how the police behavior figures in these problems.   When politicians depend on the support of a handful of wealthy individuals and corporations, whose interests do you think they're going to put first?  Yours?  The nations? Or their benefactors?    After reading a little more of Chaits work, I see him as some kind of New York Times wannabe. He is one of those cliched, tiresome liberals who is always trying too hard. You know the type.  You mean statements like this?   Is this a serious remark or an attempt at humor?   Once upon a time, it was thought ridiculous and absurd to think women should be treated equal to men. The 21st century is ready when you are Marco!    Apparently, having an opinion different from Ted Cruz makes you either a communist or a fascist.  The man is an overwrought weenie.   The preferable solution, but if it's not politically possible to implement a tax, a subsidy for low carbon forms of energy could serve as a backdoor way of charging for the external costs of carbon.   Different music for different moods.  I generally prefer listening to more complex music, but sometimes I want to hear something uncluttered and direct, like a Howling Wolf blues or Hank Williams ballad.    Even if the costs alternatives (like coal) don't include their indirect costs?    Indeed.  Here is an [fine performance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNegch1_dyU) of a devastating piece by a composer who is none of the above.    If you like Kind of Blue and mellower music,  I would say [Relaxing] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vNreXKw2Qw) or [Cooking](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcIiu1kQMx0) with the Miles Davis Quartet ought to  be your next listen.    Judging from my own experience, I'd say classical music (in the widest sense of the word) would gain a bigger audience if the performers and promoters started presenting more 20/21st century pieces.  For listeners coming from a jazz or rock background, I think Stravinsky, Glass, Shostakovich, Whitacre or (insert your favorite modern or  contemporary composer here) are much more readily accessible than music from the Classical and Romantic Eras.  Edit: missing words   Something Happened isn't as great, but it's a fine satirical novel.  And God Knows is great for the first 70 pages or so, as good as Catch-22.    Not like the 60's when we had challenging lyrics like 'Yummy, yummy, yummy, I got love in my tummy.' Ah bubblegum music.   It as if the GOP doesn't want Wisconsin citizens knowing how much money and time their governor is spending 'promoting the state's economy'.   Extracting tax subsidies and paying it's cashiers [less than $9 an hour](http://www.glassdoor.com/Hourly-Pay/Kohl-s-Hourly-Pay-E592.htm).  Kohl's is the perfect company for Walker's economic vision.      I've had [this album](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Best_of_Bud_Powell_on_Verve) for about 20 years and I've never grown tired of it. [This one](http://www.amazon.com/Steal-Away-Spirituals-Hymns-Songs/dp/B0000046YU) isn't bad either. And why hasn't anybody mentioned [Earl Hines] (http://www.amazon.com/Jazz-Royalty-Hines-Plays-Ellington/dp/B00000J39U).   The QCEW data show Minnesota slowing down from March 2013 to March 2014. But the CES data do not. The truth is probably somewhere in the middle  and thats why we collect data on employment from multiple perspectives. ... private sector job growth in Minnesota was faster after the Great Recession than Wisconsins.   [No, Minnesota is not 'dead last' in the Midwest in job growth](http://www.minnpost.com/macro-micro-minnesota/2014/10/no-minnesota-not-dead-last-midwest-job-growth)   As he tours the country, Walker has boasted that new businesses are starting up in Wisconsin at a higher rate than the rest of the country and that income growth for residents exceeds the national average.  Although he might prefer you don't ask him how the [income growth](http://www.wisconsinbudgetproject.org/pulling-apart-2014)  is being distributed.     I hope their candidate includes this in his advertising.  Something like  Scott Walker - the Best Boy for the Billionaires!   I'm still waiting for a right to work advocate to explain how lower wages will lead to prosperity.   Taxes are the wrong problem.  More income for the poor and middle class would generate more jobs than tax cuts.   Problem accurately and succinctly stated. Please repeat until understood.   I'm sure learning that Scott Walker busted Wisconsin's teachers union will strike fear in heart of America's enemies.   The real question isn't why Wisconsin is lagging in wage and job growth. The real question is who Scott Walker will blame this month.   GOP lawmakers want the poor to pay for tax cuts for the rich  FTFY    Push the income to the top, push the taxes to the bottom.  That's all you need to know about 21st GOP economic goals.   Ted Cruz is [owned](http://www.nationalreview.com/article/416643/meet-ted-cruzs-billionaire-donors-eliana-johnson) by conservative billionaires.   Something I wouldn't have expected from Pat Metheny.  I much prefer this collaboration to Ornette Coleman's other work around the same time.      True. Accurate science, like evolution or climatology, is not acceptable.   About time someone said this about the GOP economy this clearly and unambiguously.        Since Kohl's received a huge tax subsidies and pays low wages, I'd say it's the perfect model for the economy Walker wants to create.   Thats how I think about your money, the taxpayers money. The government could charge you a higher rate and a few of you could afford it, or we could lower the rates, broaden the base and have more people participate in the economy.  Yes, because so many of us have the option of not participating in the economy if we think the tax rate is too high.     The [most authoritative study](http://www.bloomberg.com/bw/articles/2014-04-17/kansas-governor-brownbacks-lab-for-steep-tax-and-budget-cuts) of the effect of these measures is a January report by the Kansas Legislative Research Department, a nonpartisan arm of the legislature. It found that revenue isnt keeping up with expenses even after cuts in spending on K-12 schools, colleges, libraries, local health departments, courts, and welfare. If nothing changed, the research departments numbers show, the states general fund would have a shortfall of about $900 million by fiscal year 2019, or 14 percent of expenses that year. The states constitution requires a balanced budget, so either taxes will have to go back up or spending will have to come down even more. **The tax cuts dont pay for themselves,** says Duane Goossen, who served as state budget director under both Republican and Democratic governors. **That just is not happening.**  But I doubt any number will rattle the true believers.  Tax cuts are always good, and any contrary evidence is denigrated or ignored.   Ted Cruz - America needs a tough talking weenie for President!   I'm hoping God tells him to go for it.  And tells him to smite Walker, Bush, Rubio, Paul, and Cruz with a sword.   Something else that's always changing is the methods for and the costs of generating energy from non-fossil fuels.  Sticking with carbon is a loser's choice.   Like Sara Palin, Walker plays the politics of resentment quite well. Wisconsin's biggest economic problems center around the still shrinking manufacturing economy, but Walker's managed to convince part of the electorate that Wisconsin's problems are the over-educated liberals, overpaid civil servants and welfare recipients.  Meanwhile he's greatly reduced public services, ended many employment protections, and has ground down Wisconsin's education system, which was one the finest in the country.  He wants to makeover Wisconsin into the low wage model, typically found in the reddest states. I see the strategy he's using, but why people keep falling for it, I wish I understood.    Try Go Down Moses.   [At $8.57 an hour for a cashier](http://www.glassdoor.com/Salary/Kohl-s-Salaries-E592.htm), the Kohl's model would align perfectly with Walker's economic goals.  This man isn't worth his own turds.    Governors in Wisconsin are elected for for year terms. 2012 was a recall election, and was not held at the same time as the Presidential election.   Whereas Paul needs a toy bucket to hold his accomplishments.   Wisconsin has two electorates, one that only shows up in Presidential election years and one that shows up for every election. In Presidential election years, Wisconsin elects senators like Tammy Baldwin and Russ Feingold, and almost always votes for the Democratic Presidential candidate (albeit sometimes by very thin margins).  In off year elections, when the voting population skews older, Wisconsin elects conservatives like Walker and Ron Johnson.       And we all thought he was an arrogant politician, growing up cossetted and wealthy environment.  But look he drives his own car! And he eats fast food! So he must care about common Americans.  He's truly one of us!   Hope you're right.  No time to get complacent though.   It's likely to only get worse. Budget cuts to the IRS will make it [even easier](http://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2014/12/rich-people-cheer-republicans-cut-irs-budget) for the wealthy to evade taxes and lowers the risk of an audit.  The Dems should make it a campaign issue.     Finally, a ray of light here in Wisconsin.      Passing pointless , grandstanding laws that smack down the unsuccessful and unfortunate.  Your GOP in action!!!   Claims to help the poor, actually hurts them. Pretty much the regular GOP playbook.   And these guys are supposed to appeal to millennials?    You're correct, a business exists to earn money. The job-creating claim is used to justify special tax breaks for and reduce restrictions on businesses.   I obviously can't speak to your family's tax situation, but I really don't see any reason to doubt the numbers in [this chart](http://ctj.org/ctjreports/2015/04/who_pays_taxes_in_america_in_2015.php#.VS7kpfnF9AY).   Sure it's an important part of the economy.  But right now we capital sitting idle (people are buying government bonds at zero interest) because there aren't enough investment opportunities.  The economy is short of demand now, not capital.    It's not people who are working 80 hours a week building a business that are pulling a trick, and it's not even the 1% that pulling a trick. It's the investor class .1% (or even the .01%) that are running off with a huge share of America's income.     If you're wealthy, you're not going to be taxed when you're dead.  Your heirs are going to be taxed, who didn't do anything but win the birth lottery.  Part of the reason for estate taxes is that great concentrations of wealth tend to destabilize countries, especially democracies. (You need to have 5 million before the estate tax is an issue.)    Again the consumer demand would make it worthwhile to start a bakery. But the point of the analogy is that an economy requires both sellers and buyers, supply and demand, and the GOP has given way to much credit and advantage to the suppliers, to the point where it's starting to suppress demand.    This comment from Temuzjin summed it up pretty well  To create jobs, you generally need supply of goods and demand for goods. A rich entrepreneur who hires people to make goods helps with the supply side. These are commonly called "job creators." However, you could just as easily call a guy who buys a loaf of bread (or another good) a "job creator" because he or she helps with the demand side. Without demand, jobs that supply goods soon become unprofitable, which means that those jobs vanish.    The "rich" are not a fixed set of people.  The GOP is trying to [fix that] (http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/republicans-push-for-a-permanent-aristocracy/2015/04/14/aa434f82-e2e5-11e4-81ea-0649268f729e_story.html).   Refresh my memory, who was pushing for the war, Bush and the Republican legislators or the Democrats?   The point is that you need multiple ingredients to create jobs, especially consumers.  To say that the wealthy are the job creators is like saying that gasoline is what makes cars move, and ignoring everything else. I also noticed you didn't include anyone from the investment and banking industries, which is group that has benefited the most over the last decades.   They wouldn't have created many jobs without a middle class to spend money on their products. And I notice you didn't include any one who inherited their wealth on your list.   It's the same game of hide the ball the GOP has playing since the 1980's.  Look at this tax cut!  Think how much working families will save! No need to look at the numbers too closely.  It's a tax cut for everybody!   Telling us they're the 'job creators' was another pretty good one. People have been falling for that one for decades.  Edit: I don't think I've ever posted anything on Reddit that recieved this many responses,  (some of them quite good). So, while I have your attention, please let me elaborate a little:  Take your investment capital and try to run a successful job-creating business in a place that lacks.  - a government that enforces contracts  - a government that protects you against physical assault and fraud.  - Government services (Take your brilliant idea for a business and open it a place with crappy roads and no public transportation.  Or for a real challenge, a place with no public water and sewer.)  - competent employees (who in America, have usually been educated at public expense)  - or most importantly, customers with money to spend  Sure investment capital plays a role in creating jobs and wealth.  But it's not the whole game.  The conservatives have exaggerated the role capital plays in the economy, and used it as a reason to justify low taxes or public giveaways to business, to reduce the rights and protections of employees, and policies that reduce labor's share  of the [national income](http://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/09/09/why-labors-share-of-income-is-falling/l).    To be fair, they also did a pretty good job of weakening America when George W. Bush was president.   Today's Republican Party! Making America's economy work very well for a very few!   Dumb as a 50 lb. bag of potatoes, those Idaho lawmakers.   Apparently we need to be either subtle or sarcastic, not both.   I hope he doesn't spend too much time working on his inauguration speech.  [Current odds](http://www.oddsshark.com/entertainment/us-presidential-odds-2016-futures) are not running in his favor.   While other GOP contenders have called for loosening penalties for nonviolent drug offenders, Rubio has not ... He has also said that marijuana "is not good for the country," and that he thinks there's "no responsible way to recreationally use" it.  Unlike, say, alcohol.   Guess I should have added an /s.     Once again, needless government regulations are obstructing a business.  Think the GOP will pick up on this?  Edit:  Holy Molyl, this is certainly an impressive number of downvotes.  I didn't think this was needed, but **/S**.   Can't see why. The changes he wanted to make was about the only time he's been honest with Wisconsin.    Wong Michelle. God is punishing us with a plague of Republicans.   Ken Burn's Jazz Series is a decent enough introduction.    I don't think the super PACs funding our elections are run by people who spend a lot of time on buses. Or care much about the people taking them.   Well, they'd feel pretty foolish if they paid retail for a candiate like Ted Cruz.   We cannot quite say Paul committed a Four-Pinocchio violation, but its close.  But the kid's got a lot of talent.  Bet he does it next time.   If we ignore climate change, maybe it'll go away.  Or maybe we'll go away.   Somehow, the GOP only gets hysterical and overwrought about the deficit when the issue is social service spending. Tax cuts for the wealthy or defense spending?  No worries!          So thats why ALEC and Scott Segal are signaling to other conservatives to shut the heck up about climate science  not because any flood of solutions is forthcoming, but because the science fight has become a distraction from the real work, the important work, which is blocking solutions and protecting the interests of the wealthy.  Get ready for a new exciting set of lies about climate change! From the people who've been lying about climate change for last 30 years!   It's as if they've discovered an antidote for facts.   Haskins called it a rather extreme position to say that we ought to allow dangerous pollutants to destroy the only planet we know of that can completely sustain human life, and he suggested work on technologies that can reduce CO2 emissions without destroying whole economies.  Tell me, after your organizations spent a couple decades trying to deny an obvious truth, why would I take any argument offered by ALEC or the Heartland Institute seriously in the future?   I don't understand why.  They never seem to have a problem ignoring the interests of middle and lower income Americans.   He certainly shows the same ability to understand [environmental issues](http://thesciencewritingblog.com/2014/09/07/ronald-reagan-said-trees-cause-more-pollution-than-automobiles-do-ignoring-trees-conversion-of-co2/).  Edit: missing word   "'Now this was the sin of your sister Sodom: She and her daughters were arrogant, overfed and unconcerned; they did not help the poor and needy.  Arrogant,overfed and unconcerned -  Looks like the GOP has hit the trifecta.    Far right I can understand. One can make cogent arguments for conservative positions.  It's this sort of nonsensical legislation that makes me wonder if their brains have lost partial function.  	116
 Trent with Oliver Stone AND RODNEY DANGERFIELD.   I get it.    Time for a jog.   Nothing but [prams](http://imgur.com/a/oL8Eg#0).    *Varieties*. Unless I'm missing something. Very cool otherwise!    I like to think of this as the Happy Gilmore slapshot of the cycling world.      I agree. Dogs don't like to put themselves where they're likely to be reprimanded by the owner. They're taught to play nice otherwise they'll get a paddlin' and I don't think you can teach cats the same sentiment. The real 'dick' in these videos are the owners, causing the conflict with, and then laughing at their dogs trying to cope with mixed messages.   I'm guessing it will be to promote the VEVO Tension video.    "what the fuck do I say to this guy?"  I felt the same way when I met him. All I could muster up was to continue a joke conversation that Aaron North started when he was signing a record of mine. Trent didn't hear my stupid joke, but was nice enough to get me to repeat it so he could hear. I managed to get a smirk from him, so at least I've got that going for me.    The ol' 'help me insult you more effectively' PM. I like the cut of your jib.          And having varying levels of success.          Is this the complete photo? As awesome as it is, It would be great to have his whole shadow in frame.    Wartime hipsters.    Fair call. It was only marginally better than 'The Circle of Life'.    You're right. It is the worst type of post because it turned into a circlejerk of sorts. It was initially in defense of AskMyFavouriteColor's comment. Walk down the street and ask the first ten strangers you meet what a Cerberus is and you'll get a blank stare from at least 9. I can guarantee that the majority of people on this thread that recognise a Cerberus, recognise it from Harry Potter - one of the most widely read pieces of fiction of the last two decades. A smaller percentage will have already of known it from ancient mythology.  So it shouldn't be accepted that everyone should know.  I started editing because of something I remember reading on Reddit recently. That was there are some things that you can't criticize on Reddit and Harry Potter is one of them. I was merely curious and wanted to put it to the test.    The maple kind?    Buy the ticket, take the ride.    Not everyone has read or watched the Harry Potter series.  Edit: I haven't read or watched the Harry Potter series.  Edit 2: I think the Harry Potter series is overated.  Edit 3: It's amazing people are still reading this down here. Also, I imagine that J.K. Rowling stole many ideas for          Harry Potter.       Stygian Cerberus?        Well now, that's uncomfortable.   He also spoke about the (early) influences of the book 'Midnight Express'.   The head of a smaller bird.    One, two, he's after you...    'sup.   [Uh, Hildi 'in the hot box.](http://i.imgur.com/2F0JHOz.jpg)   That's a very good call.      That's right, I remember now. Hell, he even made fun of his own fans in the same way.   I'm fairly sure I saw similar references in Jhonen Vasquez's 'Johnny the Homicidal Maniac'.    'sup Imgur.   I've never had so much fun.   Motherfucker.      Tell him he's dreamin'.      "Awww FU-"   WOAHDUDE.       Nothing special to report, really. There is a main water pipe and sewerage system that runs the length of my street. Due to age, and because of the hill that my street runs over, these pipes have always been problematic and there is always maintenance going on. One day a few months back it was shit city. The sewerage pipe burst while they were trying to fix it and a brown river gushed down the hill for an hour. They 'fixed' it again up until yesterday when the street sharted, as per the photo. All good for now.  TL;DR - Problematic sewerage pipe.   If so, I really hope it's not menstruating.    A gaping shit hole, no less.       Move over Third World Kid, introducing Skeptical Fox.

    I had some Thai food earlier, and she ate a whole spring roll! This was after being fed earlier in the day, mind you.

       Sry, but if i hate anything most than it is this type of questions who force me to think about what i hate most.   -_-   Thanks :)   reddit gives you wings!   No!

You will get every information about celebrities and movies (We will be launching the movie category soon after the Hollywood).    This was just a demo page.

    Coffee. How do I die? Happily.   Thank you!      I'm getting a tattoo soon of the solar system and am including a line in each planet to indicate the direction of their axial tilt. using this picture as reference http://rossmannellcomments.edublogs.org/files/2013/12/Planetary-Axial-Tilts-1qtzpi8.jpg can i make the angles negative? so instead of Earth being 23.4 degrees away from the sun, can it be 23.4 degrees pointing towards the sun? I'm assuming yes because that is what happens during summer, but just wanted to make sure. Thanks!  	5
 I don't consume nicotine, nor am I a big baseball fan, but I thought this was interesting.  Will they allow gum?  How many players chew tobacco?  Any notable players chew it?      As a basketball addict, law school graduate, media researcher, and writer, Silver could confidently rely on me as a dynamic, creative, collaborative, hard-driving member of the league office.  I would take great pride in researching international digital television rights for live broadcasts, forecasting changes in social media demographics, writing speeches for Silver's appearances with non-profit charities, brainstorming novel approaches to preserving the game's competitive integrity, and getting his dry cleaning if need be.  Whatever needs to be done thoroughly, correctly, and thoughtfully.  I would always remind myself that the NBA is no where without the fans, as the game obviously existed before the creation of the league. The game is as important to the high rollers who take private jets to away games on a whim and have lavish arena suites as it is to the single parent who saves up just enough each year to drive four hours both ways to take their children to a home game, sit in the nosebleeds, and savor every moment as their family cheers on their team.  Silver and previous commissioners have been from New York, Connecticut, or Massachusetts, but hopefully they'd let a hard-working Midwesterner join in the fun.  The NBA is truly unique entertainment, a growing (and complicated) business, an aspirational calling, and has a storied, memorable, highlight-filled past.  I want to be a part of its storied, memorable, highlight-filled future, all while contributing to the continued success of the league I've loved since I first picked up a basketball.  See...  Completely serious.  :)   Adam Silver should hire me.  Completely serious.   So basically this is a blank canvas to share what's been swimming around your head about matters relating to the NBA.  Sometimes we all have thoughts that may not be worth making a post, so just reply with what's been on you mind!  Have fun and let it out.  We are here to listen and comment and upvote.      Where do all our Venn diagrams overlap?  Edit:  a better word.   Please describe them if possible.  Thanks and Happy Siete De Mayo!   Looking forward to Scorsese directing you in "Spider-fella".   Feel free to explain your answer and respectfully egg on division rivals.   Edit:  Be sure not to downvote just because you disagree or dislike someone's answer.  Reply to create a robust discussion instead.  Have fun!      So you can be a Browns fan and say Johnny Manziel (QB), then others with reply to you with offers from their own team.  Perhaps there will be counter offers or 3-way trades that require representation from other franchises?  Who knows.   You can trade multiple players, draft picks, coaches, mascots, whatever.  Just will be interesting to see what we think assets are worth.   Keep in mind, if you're including players/assets that others might not know too much about, please provide information about them (position, years in league, stats, highlight reel)   Have fun!  Edit:  Fixing what needs to be fixed.   Obviously half-time would be a relieving endeavor.  But what if they need to drop a huge deuce in the middle of the 3rd quarter?  Do they send in a 6th man and go to the locker room?  Do they train their digestive system by eating at certain times?  Or are they all iron colons?   Outstanding current players who you have a strong feeling will just never quite make the cut.  Not looking for just borderline HoF players who you think could go either way.  I'm talking the ones you KNOW won't make it but get really, really close.      Be sure to mention the location of the stadium and franchise.  Looking forward to discussions about Wembley Stadium.  Seriously.   Humorous fat jokes are allowed, but looking more for stories, habits, feverish depression after a pre-season loss, etc.   	18
 /u/late_night_grumbler    He's prolific, clever, hilarious, and cranky.  He amuses me mightily.     Wait.... what just happened?    Sofia Ford Coppola.  I'd be expecting some great New Wave.  And some Radio Department.    [L'Eau D'Issey pour Homme](http://www.basenotes.net/ID26120927.html)... It's strange and wonderful.  Worst has to be Aqua di Gio.  Just no.    If you still have the booklet for the SNES game Super Mario World, it actually has an illustration that tells you.  I'm sure you can find it on google image search.  He's tall.    I was put on medication for hypertriglyceridemia at 21.  Because I wasn't overweight, the doctor told me it was genetic.  She also told me that because it was genetic, there was nothing I could do from a dietary standpoint to get off of my medication.  When I was 26, my body building friend told me about intermittent fasting and how you can use it to re-sensitize your body to breaking down various components and nutrients in your food.  I started doing a 20/4 schedule every day.  I quit taking my medication one month before my annual physical, and I'd gone from the 1000 level that got me on meds in the first place to a 200, which is high, but doesn't require medication!  The doctor let me go off of my meds!    Absolutely.  Then I'd loll all over my spacious, cool bed that no one has night sweats in...    "Take care!"   Neil Young!    So would you say it's safe to say, when it comes to marriage, you believe that people make their own beds and have to sleep (not have sex) in them?   This image just changed my life.  For the better?  It's not clear yet.    But Grumbler, what if your spouse hates to talk?  Avoids conversation like the plague?    I've recently discovered that my 8 month old daughter is obsessed with teeth.  She's stopped looking at faces and only looks at teeth.  If you get too close, she'll try to touch them.  Stranger still, she thinks they are funny.  She'll laugh if she touches them.    When holding your baby for the first time.   /u/late_night_grumbler - I've always wanted to see if Oscar the Grouch is as green as he looks in person. ;)   Don't worry, you have my word on all of this. :)  I'm very optimistic about you kids... You seem passionate, involved, and aware for your age.  I think you'll accomplish wonderful things.     What can millennials do to support you?    This is probably pretty broad, but man, considering the garbage we have to put up with from the baby boomers regarding us and our life choices, I don't want to be that person...    We don't.  Both my mother and my husband are the type of people who will switch sides if you agree with them.  Ahahaha! (But it's not funny, it's annoying as fuck.)   I went out to lunch with a new co-worker.  He was obviously a very manipulative person.  He would make an assumption based on something innocuous I would mention, turn it into a piece of flattery, and then use it to ask an extremely verbose question that wasn't something I could actually answer, it was just to illustrate how smart he was....  This is vague.  Here:  Me: Oh, well I do intermittent fasting, so I didn't have breakfast.  Him: So, you seem to be very well aware that the US government is lying to us about how is in our food and what long term effects those lies have on us, and you're not having it.  That said, do you have any secrets or strategies you'd like to share regarding prenatal dieting to promote newborn growth and development?  Me: Um. No... I, uh, just didn't eat lunch meat.  (WHAT IS HAPPENING RIGHT NOW?)  Then we got in his car and he had a fuzz buster... And then he told me his favorite Led Zeppelin Album is IV.  I decided to never suggest we get lunch again.    Well, I will say that KIDS think you're one of them.  I had a funny incident with my best friend and her girlfriend where their 11 year olds kept trying to get me to flake off the adult group and do things with them.  Eventually my best friend had to explain that I'm a grown up and they needed to ignore me.  Ahahaha.    The most ridiculous had to be when I was in Houston on a business trip.  I was 27, six months pregnant (like obviously pregnant, I weigh 107 lbs normally, so that baby was wayyyy out there).  I went to dinner with my CEO.  We sat down and the waiter handed him a normal folding menu.  They brought me a regulation sized football on a tee with the menu items printed on it.  This was a children's menu.    The night I got married, I was 24.  I went out to dinner with my groom, his step sister and her husband.  The waitress was probably 17.  She looked up and said "So three adults and one child then?"  On my 16th birthday, I was turned away from seeing a PG-13 film.  When I lived in Ames, IA, I paid the child's bus fare of $.50 well into my mid-20's.   I was once asked at a nightclub who I bribed to get my ID since it listed me as drinking age.    Yeah, absolutely.  It's defensiveness at its finest.  The truth is that you're subjected to just as much, if not more, familial judgment once you HAVE the kid... You're not sleep training right or you aren't holding the baby right or you're not feeding them solids soon enough or god only knows what.    Seriously, I'd just as soon not talk about my experiences as a parent.  I get not wanting to hear about it, and truthfully, it's not all that I'm thinking about... what a special snowflake my baby is and how to best strategize her whole life... I have a career and a marriage.  I'm a home owner, I volunteer for six hours a weekend as a companion for Hospice.  I have hobbies and interests that are independent of that little person I'm responsible for.  Having a baby doesn't lobotomize you and making your children the literal center of your universe only ensures they will be ill-prepared for their lives later on.    Much like feminists and tumblr, a few nutjobs on Facebook have made us out to be completely crazed terrorists.    Yeah seriously.... if you don't want kids, and you have as much resentment for them as it seems, you probably shouldn't be a parent any way.... My Grandmother in law was always telling her daughters to their faces she never wanted them and they just held her back.  That's an awful thing to do to someone.  I don't want that for any child.    It really bothers me that child-free people attack children instead of the adults who are supposedly infringing on their freedom of choice.  Calling a little person a "shit-machine" is not cool.  You started out as a child too.  There's no need to be awful to little kids just because you don't want them.    You've got this wrong... if you see us next to actual children, we're obviously not children... it's when you lack proper context that people get confused.  Your character needs to be at an event with a bunch of adults.  I'm routinely offered a child's movie ticket and children's menus, but it's only when I'm out with taller adults... I'm nearly 30.    She's doing it wrong then.  I've had seven wedding proposals in my lifetime.  My actual husband never even proposed.    It's the true things that are the funniest... this is perfect fan-girl in 6th grade logic... I always imagined painting a wonderful portrait (of Tom Petty because I'm weird and have daddy issues) a la Marge Simpson... Fall wedding (he'd wear that light brown leather jacket with the tassels and I'd be in a tie-dye dress I'd never be caught dead in as an adult).   I'd have a ring of sunflowers around my left ankle.  Very 1990's.  My mom still bothers me about following through with this someday.  Uh, no.    I'm not surprised, but you can see right in my original post what the rationale is.... if you try to help someone, it shows there is a deeper investment there than a superficial, unnatural, and simple validation.  It shows you were listening and took the time to think about the how and why and what can be done.  A smart person doesn't surround themselves with "yes people," they find those who know what works and cut out what doesn't.      That's because most women want you to agree with them and tell them they're not crazy...    Really, why is that?   I have been a [manic pixie dream girl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manic_Pixie_Dream_Girl) for well over half of my serious relationships.   Attempt to solve or advise me how to solve what is bothering me.  I don't like it when men commiserate, it sends off warning bells.  I prefer a pragmatic 12 step solution.  Even if I don't take your advice, it shows you care.  Agreeing with me just tells me you want me to like you.    The best damn thing.    Answering machines.  I remember I used to love fiddling with that little cassette tape... it was so cute! :)   I like to laugh, and you make me laugh.  I feel obligated to talk about the things I love. :)   http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/2oijc5/girls_of_reddit_when_the_guys_arent_around_what/cmnfnr3?context=3  I'm not sure what it really is, but it should probably be this gem from the /u/late_night_grumbler .... I still laugh every time.    United States of Whatever - Liam Lynch  Detachable Penis - King Missile   Valley Girl - Frank Zappa   Walkedypants - Ryan Adams     I actually don't know anything about the guy behind the Radio Dept.  Although I think he might be a bit druggy... It'll be fine, I'm guessing.    I think it was intentional... Pard.    I think you'll find that these kinds of things are easy to pick up on right when you meet someone.  Typically it doesn't get as far as dating.  They've been written off before romantic involvement.    I would install a sump pump in my basement and remodel my bathroom.    Emphasis on that flossing bit... if you floss daily, you will add 5-10 years onto your lifespan.  It's very important, folks.  And if you don't suffer from Halitosis but do have bad breath, this is how you cure it!     J.K. Rowling addressed this.  She said it isn't taught in school, unfortunately.  She said that Wizards and Witches are pretty modest and self-conscious about the subject.  There was also a bit about group masturbation among Hufflepuffs, but that might've been a joke.  Sounds about right, however...     No, no, sorry.  The e-mail and phone systems are totally separate.  Here: Re-write: "One of the entry-level minimum-wage employees replied to all..."   Oh, sorry, the point was supposed to be that an entry level employee replied to all... I suppose the point is lost if you don't know I was working in Client Services for a huge Outsourcing firm.    Light (i.e. light roast, and light-hearted), sweet, and early.   A company-wide e-mail went out about our CEO stepping down.  One of the agents on the telephone replied to all on it saying she needed to have an IUD put in before she ended up pregnant again.     It's awkward to lift something and position it securely over the console from the driver's seat.  It's safer to situate the item properly by coming at it unobstructed and in a way that will make you certain it will stay in place.  Also, being that I'm 4'11.5", the wheel of my car and the seat are close enough together, not much fits... I don't have room to maneuver my bent elbow around.  I'd rather open the other door than reposition my seat.      I'm going to reply again, I got interrupted the first time. :)  If you're a lady, you might want to at least take a few cheesecake photos at home if you don't want to do actual bedroom shots.  Your body is never going to look the same, and you'll be glad you captured yourself in all your glory.  Keep them locked up, of course and out of the iCloud ;)  For saving up for your (or the mother of your children's) maternity leave, all the books will tell you to save salary for what you'll be out... that's great except most of us don't get paid in current week.  You'll want to save time out plus three weeks since that's how long it'll take before your first paycheck rolls in.  To expand upon the travel thing, if you like to go fishing and camping, please make sure to do that, it's going to be a few years before you're able to do that as a few day affair (you can have the in-laws watch the baby and boat for a few hours, but c'mon... it's not the same and you'll probably just miss the baby).  You should also just make a lot of time to be romantic with your partner.  Work on strengthening your relationship to the best of your ability.  The next few years will be a challenge and that part of your life is going to get pushed to the side quite a bit.  Talk to each other and spend time with each other and just appreciate each other.  :)   Well, I tend to find that /r/advice is a better place to go for sincerity, but you definitely won't get the same volume of replies.  If you must ask a question on /r/askreddit it is better to tag it as [serious].  Glad I could help!    Any spendy home renovations or projects... like if you know you need a new roof in the next 1-2 years, now is the time...money is going to be tight while you adjust.  Travel!    [I got this for you.](http://www.cbsnews.com/news/french-study-suggests-younger-women-should-stop-wearing-bras/)   Wow guys... wow.  I would ask them when they think they'll come to a decision and when you will be contacted.  I would ask them (if it wasn't already addressed in the interview) if you will be able to give the full amount of notice needed with your current employer if you are offered this position (you're pointing out how responsible you are).  I would ask them how long they have both been with the company, and emphasize that you're looking for a long-term career in a great company.    You're up awfully early... and arguing about LoTR? You must've had a restful weekend. ;)   You gave some very solid relationship advice to a kid today about perception and personal responsibility and refusing to be a victim. My wish for you is that you can give that gift to yourself. We live in this strange, beautiful world only once. I would hate for you to miss it by isolating yourself and cutting your life short.    Like the old Dr. Pepper slogan "You try it, you get it!" :)   Cream cheese and green olives! :)   That would make me very sad.  You need to live to find true love, do more traveling, and continue to offer outstanding upholstery.  Don't give up, VanDriver1... you're a cool dude.    You shall.  I think you might be clenching your teeth, working out just a little too hard, and pinching the occasional nerve. ;)   I want to stress that I'm not a medical professional.  It sounds to me like you have a few things going on.  I encourage you to bring these things up at your next physical.  They sound minor and relatively normal to me, but it's better to get peace of mind from a doctor than from a stranger on the internet.  :)    Well, that's kind of ironic of you to say... This link: http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/heartattack/signs was included in two of my replies in this same thread.  You'll notice they're from the same site.  I'll edit for you and add it to the main comment.    [I got this for you, friend.](http://www.md-health.com/Tingling-In-Left-Arm.html)    I actually didn't mean the multi-player... I meant just by myself. :)    I only screwed around with the multi-player to do ridiculous things like to summon and become the Lich or the owner of the brothel and get rainbow armor and other stupid things that only amuse you for an hour.    The original Neverwinter Nights.  Man, I love that game.  Never gets old to me.    I'm not a doctor, however the sensation for a heart attack is commonly described as being only one arm and feeling like ice water is being poured down it.  It sounds to me like you're on the right track with your carpal tunnel theory.  I have it too.  If I use my hands too much during the day, at night I can't hold them over my shoulders without them trembling.    I wouldn't worry about your heart just yet, but if you're really concerned, mention it at your next physical.  Take care! :)   I'm sorry to hear that your wife had heart issues.  I hope she's doing better now.   Well, just in case you want to read more about it, here is a great publication from the US Dept. of Health and Human Services.  It does say right in here that they don't believe the differences to be stark enough to alter the way we educate people about symptoms, however, it definitely talks about a proven delineation.   http://www.nih.gov/news/pr/dec2007/nhlbi-10.htm   That's a great question.  [This article](http://www.nih.gov/news/pr/dec2007/nhlbi-10.htm) from the US Dept. of Health and Human Services correlates it to the fact that women live longer than men and the older you are, the less likely pain in your chest would be an obvious symptom.    TEAM YOUSE   Youse guys!  Youse goin' away! Weeee!    Perverts on the internet refer to this now as "invisible high heels."   Disappear  Decision   Guarantee   Conscience  Cupboard     There is this stupid poster I made posted on every surface at my former job.  I made it in MS Paint.  Everyone thinks my husband made it.   I also wrote their 100+ page orientation manual for incoming supervisors, but I went with a version code rather than listing myself as the author.  Same goes for the calling software user manual.    I walk on my tip-toes when I'm not wearing shoes.  My daughter is 8 months old... she's just started pulling herself into a standing position, but never stays flat on her feet. Awww.    Okage.  Shadow King Stan is hilarious!  In fact, the whole game is hilarious!     This isn't something I feel I need to purposefully state to head off advances... if I'm talking to someone as a fellow human being, sooner or later I'm going to bring up my husband in an anecdote or some other natural mention, as he's a huge part of my life.  If someone wants to know if I'm available, all they need to do is be observant enough to see the ring on my left hand.     Willow Lake shampoo and Orbitz soft drinks.    This question is super broad, so instead I'm just going to tell you a ridiculous story.  My general practitioner doesn't do pre-natal, so I was referred to an OB/GYN for all of those appointments.  In my first trimester of pregnancy, I got Shingles.  Shingles is technically a type of non-sexually transmitted herpes related to a mutation in the Chicken Pox virus stored in your body.  Because it was unrelated to my pregnancy, my general prescribed Valtrex to cure it.  I was to take it for a week.  Every appointment my OB/GYN would ask me how my Valtrex was treating me.  And I'd have to explain again, that I had shingles... I took it for a week, it's not ongoing... The third time this happened, I said all this again, and she said "So no outbreaks in your genital area causing you concern?"   My OB thought I had herpes and was too embarrassed to discuss it.  I lived in serious fear she was going to order a C-Section to avoid me infecting my baby's eyes with an STI I didn't actually have.    Well, Tim Allen served time for being a cocaine dealer in his pre-Home Improvement days.  Apparently people either don't know about this, or don't care.    Sadly no, but the later is the goal in mind.  I'd start looking for jobs again as soon as possible.  Good luck, sir!    By secretly drop, do you mean go incommunicado or do you mean selling your contract to an employer?    I'm only shocked that more people don't realize that Bill Gates had rich parents.  Yeah, he's much, much richer than his parents, but the asshole had a Porche at 16.  It really grinds my gears every time I have to read that sanctimonious graduation speech of his about how you're an idiot for thinking your parents aren't people.  We didn't all grow up like you did, taking our parents for granted and treating them like shit, man.  It's not universally appropriate.    This is more of a public service announcement: Men and women have different early symptoms during a heart attack.  The commonly known ones are men-specific (numbness and tingling in one arm).  The early sign for women is a constricted throat.  Please talk about this in real life, you could save a life.   Edit: [Further Reading](http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/heartattack/signs)   Listen man, again, I never said I was raped. I don't believe I was. This discussion is happening outside of my reality. I'm glad that people are having a meaningful discussion about gender roles and assault and personal responsibility, but you'll notice I replied to a "one night stand" thread, not a listen to my sexual assault sob story thread. I was a young college student with an Internet boyfriend. This was almost a decade ago and both me and my ex are now married to other people. The kid the story is about is in a serious relationship.    I was knitting for years before the baby.  I'm a pretty fierce technical knitter.  My baby has only two things I've knitted her... an egg plant and some sock-topped moccasins.    I *was*... I have a baby now.  All my interests are on hold for the next five years minimum.  I also used to do relief print making and read voraciously.  These days I just knit.    The Sims 2... the little movies for important life events were so precious.     Probably their hair.    I got really heated about some asshole telling a newbie on the Pullip forum that a type 3 body and an Obitsu were comparable in height.  Yes, I know this looks like it was written in another language, but damn, don't lie to people just getting into the hobby!   Right?  I don't feel that much younger, but one time he said to me that he saw Nirvana play live in 1991 at First Ave in Minneapolis.... in '91, I was uh... four.  I was four.    I CANNOT believe it took someone this long to make this comment.  I thought this was going to be the first thing someone said.  Listen man, I'm really into color theory.    "We'll kick your ass" is better than "We'll put a boot in your ass."  I think you missed my point entirely.    Shout-out to "Accidental Racist" too.... I mean, this is one of those songs that when you tell people about it, they think you're kidding.    No.  My husband is 11 years older than me.  While this mattered less in my 20's, in my teens, it would have been very inappropriate.  Furthermore, my husband was jawdroppingly handsome in high school.  If we had been the same age, he would have been wayyyyy out of my league.       "We'll put a boot in your ass, it's the American Way."  Thanks for making us all look like assholes, Toby.  Jesus.    Well, I was very drunk, so drunk logic was telling me to punish myself for being unfaithful to my boyfriend.  I definitely regretted it later...  This incident was the catalyst for me to go on an anti-depressant.    Is it really necessary to call me a rapist?  You've taken an idea and made it quite personal.  I never used the word rape.  If you read my comment carefully, you'd be able to deduce that I felt awful about the whole thing.  I didn't attempt to press charges or any thing like that.  I bought him new sheets.  I get why you're upset, but let's not level a rape accusation at me to prove a point.    Uhhh.  I mean, I can list some arbitrary things that were wrong with me 7 years ago, but I'm guessing you're referencing something specific to this anecdote... your comment just doesn't help me narrow down what exactly.     I went over to this new friend's house.  Things started out fine.  He made breakfast for dinner.  He suggested we play a drinking game.  He got aggressive with things like "Never have I ever worn purple sneakers," or "Never have I ever worn a yellow hoodie," these being things I was actually wearing.  We were drinking vodka.  I got blackout drunk.  He ordered a $80 box set on my Amazon account as a birthday present for himself (which lead me to overdraw my account being that I didn't know about it until that happened).  We had sex while I was blacked out.  I bled all over his sheets because I was on my period.  When I woke up I was really upset because I had a boyfriend.  I ended up banging my wrist against the sink in the bathroom until I had a bunch of bruises.  He got me into the shower and calmed me down.  We never had sex again.  Insult to injury: I overdrew my account buying him new sheets.    My husband is 39.  He refuses to associate outside of work with anyone who is not part of his immediate family.  He has no real friends.    lol, I love you, but you know full-well I'm married to a man.  I was never a lesbian.  He was just bitter af.   I got a queen sized Martha Stewart Coral Spray duvet for $14.99.  I lost it in a break-up, and I loved the damn thing... to get another, I'd have to pay about $100 on eBay.    	101

 If I had one wish, I would fuck Tia and Tamara at the same time and put nametags on their titties so I don't get their names wrong       In the crowd there's a group of 3-5 Asian men in what looks like military uniform. I've just never seen another country's soldier/sailor in uniform in the US. It's definitely not an American military uniform.    Anyone know who those a Asian men in uniform are? They were at the game yesterday too.    Alternately, are there other resources I should look at? I'm just tying to expand my knowledge of subjects, including cars.    Join us in /r/sfgiants!     gt;I am not reporting that the Giants have discussed Sanchez for Gee  I am speculating that it makes a lot of sense   I'm not reading too much into this rumor.    Aoki: "Bi yourself a steak dinner. Tri and stop me."    I could literally stand there and take 3 strikes and be more effective.    He goes to the bench. As much as I like the guy, I think we all overreacted during his hot streak. The reality is he's a solid 4th outfielder, but that's it.    I'd like to see McGehee's stats when he bats with a runner on first and less than two outs. It seems like he's an automatic DP.    It's one thing to be on a cold streak. It's another thing to be a one man rally killer.    Bumgarner vs Ross. I'm staying away from this one.       That isn't a girl???    I have a shiny new score book that I want to use today, but I also want to watch the Warriors game.    I knew Weaver had fallen off a little bit, but I didn't realize his numbers were that bad this season. I hope you all took the over on this one.    Having Marc Jackson announce a Warriors game is a cruel joke.    This crowd is really something.    I'm actually more stressed out that I won't be able to get into a bar to see it. Everything is going to be packed.    *Hello m'lady, hello m'honey, hello m'ragtime gal*    Was there alone last week to see Maxwell's walk off.   Does your overall record include the teams marked with asterisks?    I'm waiting for Ubaldo to tip his cap after leaving the game in the 8th.   They have to do the wave now because they're going to leave at the end of the inning.    Oh, come on! We get it. The guy is slumping.    RIP OP   People don't realize how good he is on defense. If not for Arenado, Panda would probably have at least one Gold Glove.    The Devil's threesome.    I love Barry because I'm a homer. Not a fan of A-Rod. It's still history though.    He's now 1 HR shy of tying Willie Mays for 4th all-time.   Edit: The game is nationally televised on ESPN. He should get a few more ABs.    RIP OP   I, for one, would love to see War Machine forced into the octagon with Bones.    [Check out this filthy curveball from Chris Heston]( http://i.imgur.com/vuUwDRJ.gif)   I use a wet sponge and then dry it off with a paper towel.    Me! I took MM in under 5 rounds!

I don't know what Matt Duffy did in the off season, but I have as much confidence in him as I do anyone in the lineup.    Was this the team he accused of stealing signs last year? I can't remember how that played out.    A 6 pack of Coors.    It will be interesting to see how Andrew Susac fits into the Giants' future plans. He has big league talent already. He just happens to be stuck behind the best catcher in baseball.    McGehee has the lifetime numbers to earn our patience at least through April.    "You need to diversify your bonds."   Weird. Panik got the day off on Wednesday. He came in late in the game, but I wouldn't expect him to need a day off today.    I hate it when people compare Bartolo Colon to Babe Ruth. I mean, he's good and all, but he's no Bartolo Colon.    After tonight, we only have 8 more games at Coors this season!    This is what happens when you live in a city whose claim to fame is a fictional boxer and a two ingredient sandwich.    Rumor is they'll eat $65mil of $80mil.    How do I score that at home?    **St. Louis Cardinals -1.5** vs the Milwaukee Brewers. Adam Wainwright is pitching against an absolutely atrocious Brewers team.    Definitely! He got that contract to win a ring and I doubt we would have won in 2012 without him.    Love to see him stay in the division. Would love even more if he totally shits on the Angels this year.    I've gone to many games alone. No one thinks twice about it.    This happened a couple weeks ago at a Sacramento Rivercats game in the 19th inning...but I left after 14.    I was sitting by the Giants bullpen and in the later innings, Romo and Kontos were warming up during a Dodgers pitching change. Josh Turner was due to lead off the next inning. He was standing at third starring absent mindedly at the Giants bullpen. Romo gave him a smile and a wave and then Turner pretended to bite his nails like he was nervous. They got a chuckle out of it and I thought some of you might too.    o/   My underpants look like a Jackson Pollock painting!    Look for me on TV guys. I'm in the first row in front of the Giants bullpen wearing a red and black flannel.    Do you live here or are you just visiting?    Any word on AJ Ellis? That looked pretty bad last night.    What's the scouting report in Bolsinger? Never heard of him.    If you get there early, check out The Yard across McCovey Cove. They serve Anchor Stream beer and have a nice view of the bay.    Possibly. I haven't eaten yet, so my first mission is to get breakfast. I'll see how long that takes.    My plan is to leave the Sunset by 11 via MUNI, so I'll be at the park by 12.       Just bought a ticket for row 1 down the third base line. I'm probably going to interfere with a live ball and end up on sports center.    Does anyone know how good Puig's English is? I was under the impression that he didn't speak it, but last night I saw him yelling something to Joc and of course there was the yelling match with Bumgarner last year.    You should look into another online sports book. Bovada generally has worse odds than 5Dimes, for example.    I'm eyeing stub hub for some last minute deals. Does anyone know if you have to print your tickets or can you just have them on your phone? I might not buy until I'm already at the park.    Edit: and do prices generally drop significantly 1 hour from game time as opposed to 4 hours from game time?    I was wondering the same thing. He's also the right fielder and a left handed hitter was up.    [Yes!]( http://theyardsf.com)   Stoked for tonight. I got a great deal on some great seats through stubhub. Going to get down there early and have some beers at The Yard. I haven't been to a game at AT T in probably 6 years.    Just any solar company?    If she talked as much trash as I do, absolutely not.    You win one MVP award and everyone thinks you're worth watching... /s   I'm literally 20 minutes from the ballpark at my sister's house, but she doesn't get the game, so I'm sitting here, watching Tosh.0, following the game thread.    I'll make a post tonight about a Thursday meet up. It would be nice to put some faces to usernames in this sub.    I'm going with family tomorrow, so I won't be able to, but I'm down to meet up Thursday.    I haven't been to a home game in probably 6 years because I moved to SD. I'll be there tomorrow and probably Thursday. I can't believe how cheap tickets are going, especially for a Dodgers series.    $7 tix on stub hub. Get to the yard, folks!    Stubhub has tickets for $13. So tempting, but I have baked potatoes and steak cooking and probably won't be able to get there by game time.    Just landed in SF. Going to the game tomorrow, but where is the best place to watch tonight? I've watched at Underdogs before, but it's going to be packed for taco Tuesday, so I doubt I'll get a table.   Edit: I'm desperate for a place in or near the Sunset to watch the game. My sister doesn't get CSN.     Haha yesterday was my first time at a sports book and I was confused by both of those things. You give them the rotation number and they give you cash when you cash out. The woman took my tickets, went to the back where I assume there's some kind of machine that separates the winners from the losers and tells her how much to pay me. She came back and gave me the cash.    I was and still am confused when betting spreads. Last night I picked 1234, or whatever the rotation number of the Pelicans, to cover. I just said, "1234 to cover." Is that correct or should I have said something else?    How does that work? You just put it in an envelope, send it to the casino and then they send you an envelope of cash back?    Damn...I made my bets this afternoon at the Flamingo.    Good call. I'm there now.    I'll be in Vegas by 4, so I think I'll be ok ;-)   Damn, I was going to go to this game but decided to take the 9am flight back to SF. Now I'm sitting at the airport because the flight is delayed.    As far as I'm concerned, Heston has earned a spot in the rotation. Right now he's one of the top 5 pitchers on the roster.    I'm gonna need a gif of that curveball.    What a play! I'm not even mad.   Duffy looking like the x-factor early on this season.   If there's runners on first and second or if the bases are loaded and there is a pop up on the infield, the umpire will call the infield fly rule. This means the batter is out whether the ball is caught or not. It's to prevent the defense from intentionally dropping the ball in order to get a double or triple play.   He's there because they want him to play everyday. He'll get plenty of time in the majors eventually, but he's not going to get better sitting on the bench.    And I left in the 14th inning :-(      [July, 6, 2011]( http://m.mlb.com/video/?content_id=16698437)      Anyone know how many times he's been ejected in his career? The Giants' announcers were saying they have never seen him argue before.    I think he clearly went, but what's up with umpires not using the help?    Joe Madden would do it.    When did Duffy become a stud? He hasn't had a bad AB this year.    That's the most success he's had on a big league field.    Mays  Bonds  Marichal  Arias   Joaquin Arias is the GOAT.   Ryan "Wheels" Vogelsong    Matt Kemp must have used all his DL time to take notes on the Dodgers pitchers.   	108
 So was True Grit. And I think both surpass their originals.   I'm assuming they didn't film this powwow, but imagine if they did. That would make the best special feature of all time.   Yeah okay I'll see you fuckers next season.   I'm gonna avoid this place till then.   Honest question: why do people think this? I really didn't think he did very well at all in Guardians.    Which one is this?   This guy sounds like a cousin of Jesse Eisenberg.      Your dog looks like Biggie.    [He slipped](http://imgur.com/Ycy0RJZ)   I'd be forced to watch Now You See Me while gagged so I can't argue with my idiot friends who think it's brilliant.

Because manly men Bane swole.      Somebody likes LSD. A lot.   Great work though.    I only watch Table Talks at this point, and only ones with casts I like. I save em up and listen to several in a row in podcast format.   The other news videos just seem redundant to me and I don't care about any of the nerd stuff, and the cheesy format is off-putting to me.   Oh well, I don't care enough to unsub or anything, but I only watch probably 10% of what they put out compared to the 90% or so that I used to watch with the original bunch.    I didn't like it either but to rank it behind Batman and Robin is just fucking absurd. Care to explain?      In terms of entertainment, check out the Tropic Thunder commentary.   In the film, Robert Downey Jr's character says "Man, I don't drop character 'till I done the DVD commentary", and he doesn't.   Good lord. It looks rotoscoped or something. That's amazing.      That one doesn't even look good on here.    Memphis TN. Johnny Cash- Big River   Shadow on the Wall - composed by Mike Oldfield - sung by Roger Chapman      The audio is overlayed with the video. ScreenJunkies is classy enough to not verbally assault the guy, however weird he may be.   Somebody mix that shit   Moon   Thats putting it lightly.   Boogie Nights, The Social Network, The Master   I bump "Looking Out My Backdoor" in my car and smack the roof like in The Big Lebowski regularly. It keeps me going.   I didn't see it so much as movie about the concept of doubt. I saw it as a set of character studies.   Doubt is so fucking good.   And any McDonagh movies play out like stage plays, mainly considering Martin was a playwright before he was a director. (By the way, read some of those. I love the Pillowman.)   Ow.   I am so okay with this.    Renner took over the Bourne series, and soon he'll take over the Mission Impossible series. Then I guess Die Hard and James Bond?   Burnie  Fargo  Animal Kingdom  Blue Ruin   The Fighter.  But really any movie where I walk out calling characters by their names instead of the actors.     WHY   This is actually the voice of Geoff, Craig Ferguson's robot-skeleton sidekick on the Late Late Show. He also does a perfect Morgan Freeman and DeNiro, among others.   I love the drummer playing along to the video. Synchronizing little beats with the machinery.    Just noticed they reused two shots of Bourne's foot on the railing and Bourne in between two windows. Kinda lazy.      I don't get it. What's the message here?   Nah. He's better as a character that pops in for a gag. 20 minutes of pure Kreiger would oversaturate it.   Not even a black neighborhood. One of the whiter areas of Memphis, actually.   McDonagh's brother made those. McDonagh's can do no wrong.

My cousin's friend took the roommate personality match exam or whatever going into college and paired her with a 95% match.   Her match wore a cape and fangs and swore to be a vampire.   Guardians of the Galaxy.  Sorry. I didn't genuinely laugh once and I didn't care about anything that was happening or any of the characters. Above that, I thought it was boringly written and I thought Bautista, Saldana, and half the other characters did a cheesy job with already cheesy enough lines. I love Pratt in Parks   Rec, Cooper in everything, and I like James Gunn as a director. I was really looking forward to it. In the end, I didn't even appreciate it as a fun, cheesy, space-opera. Maybe I'm heartless. I'm guessing y'all will think I am.   Can't wait to be lectured about cell phones ruining society and interaction in a quirky fashion.      Where's Rachel?   Good animation?

God, Manhunter is such a good movie.    Yup. That being said, I fucking love Elba and would kill for it to happen.   He's said it's not going to happen. Plus he's already 41 and Craig has 2 more movies to do.   Reminds me of that episode of Wallander   Foreshadowing of Jessie's wiring scene - Bravo, Vince!      Make prints and they'll sell like goddamn hotcakes. Beautiful.   I figured I get hate for this. He is a great actor, but recently I watched The Way, Way Back and I couldn't take him seriously at all. Especially if he puts on a weird voice behind some makeup. Knowing Miller I'll probably still love this movie, but damn if it doesn't seem like it might be hard.   [And an amazing soundtrack.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aI4iCx7LnbY)   Fuck. Yes.   I will not be able to take this seriously. I love Bennet Miller, but I really dislike Carrell in serious roles. Also, not big on Channing Tatum.   Good God that video was entrancing. This guy is great.

 I guess you wouldn't mind coming to Canada to help me out with my rims? I'll buy you a case of beer? lol   Want to be friends?    Are there places that do this type of thing? I'm very unhandy and I live in an apartment so I don't have any space for something like this lol   How'd you do those? Looks amazing.   Do you go out to restaurants often? I'm in Toronto and I've never seen Nachos without it to be honest.   Lettuce is extremely common, no idea what part of Canada you live in because I'm Canadian too lol   You should be head of marketing for Chipotle good Sir.   and?

Is this for all Goblins or just the Bilgewater ones? Or do all Goblins originate from Kezan or something?  Probably a stupid question   Huh? What are you talking about?   The genocide was carried out during and after World War I and implemented in two phases: the wholesale killing of the able-bodied male population through massacre and subjection of army conscripts to forced labour, followed by the deportation of women, children, the elderly and infirm on death marches leading to the Syrian desert. Driven forward by military escorts, the deportees were deprived of food and water and subjected to periodic robbery, rape, and massacre.   :(   If I recall correctly, Juniper   Ray Nazareth Jnr   plus he has his army gig   Hungarian friend of Geoff and Gavin* FTFY   crazy how Smith from Hat Films edits these   NO BARBARA?!

 Appreciate such a comprehensive response!  You are correct in identifying them as Stafford loans(4/6 of them are anyway).  To your questions:  1) I do not have an emergency savings. I just started building it up a couple weeks ago, opened a savings account and designated auto-deposits.   2) About 5% of my monthly income.  3) Stable as it can get. Catastrophe a la financial crisis is really the only scenario I see losing it, but let's be honest that could happen at any moment these days.  Sounds like the best strategy is to allocate all of my extra $ (my  goal is for 50% of monthly income) towards emergency fund and loan payoff. Having the mindset of paying off the loans being the equivalent of a 6.8% ROI is the best way for me to rationalize it.  Thanks!   Thanks for the response. I think this is the type of plan I'll take, as reluctant as I am to put off the investing.   Appreciate the advice, this is likely the road I'll go down. Definitely feeling the ETF game.   Do you have any friends that can give you adderall?  Obviously if you have any heart/respiratory issues you shouldn't take it, but this could easily give you the edge that puts you into passing.  EDIT: Keep in mind a lot of these practice exams are by design more difficult than the actual test. Don't let your scoring on these affect your confidence. There's a good chance you're actually just as prepared as you need to be. Don't give up!   For a robot, you are extremely helpful. You have my thanks.   I have about ~$14,000 left to pay in student loans. The interest rates on these vary from 5.35% - 6.8%.   I'm anxious to put money into investments and save, but obviously I see the benefit in just paying these off. Do these rates seem particularly high/low to those with experience?  Thanks   Finally some sound advice.   Vanguard has a pretty responsive customer service team. I've encountered technical issues like this one before and they've been swift to help me. Worth giving them a call.   Good for them, was a childish move on Wealthfront's part. This all does seem rather petty though.   Schwab's definitely the better option, but pretty sure their minimum's are all $1000, OP seemed to indicate he only has around $200 to throw around.   1) Sell shares 2) Invest $200 into Betterment or a similar tool (http://investorjunkie.com/best-robo-advisors/) 3) Read the Intelligent Investor  If you're super intrigued by the market, start a virtual stock exchange game and mess around with play money. If you have friends that are interested you can make it more fun/competitive, almost treating it like a fantasy football league.   Yeah plan is to put in at least $500 a month.   I read a review that seemed skeptical of how sustainable their business model was.   Yeah that's true. If I'm at let's say 2k and a life event happens where I can no longer invest money for some time, it will be good to already have set up.   I'm just starting to allocate funds to savings, so I'm only starting with a few hundred $ at the moment. My plan is to stick with Betterment for a few months, once I reach $3,000(the minimum for most Vanguard accounts) I'll transfer it over to them.  I've heard people complain about the Betterment fees, but honestly an annual .35% charge over a 3-4 month period doesn't bother me.  Is this smart? Should I just be keeping it in a Savings account until I hit the 3k?  Obligatory thanks for the people in this community. I've had questions before and the responses are always super helpful. This sub is one of the main reasons I've wisen'd up and started to manage my finances seriously.   Hey thanks again for this recommendation. I found a copy on a ebay a couple weeks ago, recently finished it up. I found the artwork and the story VERY impressive and intriguing. Was curious to know your take on it. I felt that there was more to the story that was as you said "between the lines" that I was missing. Any thoughts?   Places to go/avoid, favorite places for fun, unique activities to do...   This is terrific      Any chance you have a link to the high pitch prank call?   I'm a big ol' investing noob. I bought 60 shares of a stock NKA at around $2 back in February. My intention was just to hold, and monitor the stock as more of a learning experience(I couldn't motivate myself to really follow any stocks unless I had money invested). Anyway, it was recently announced that NKA is going to be purchased, with shareholders receiving a little over $4 in cash for each share. The price skyrocketed to about $3.75 when this was announced. My inclination is to just wait for this buy-out to happen and take then $4 a share. However, what if something goes wrong in the purchase? Should I just take the profits I have now and sell all my shares at 3.75?  Wanted to see what some members of this community would do if they were in my position.  P.S. This subreddit is awesome. I've learned so much just by reading through the comments section and following discussions.   Recently starting looking through Incal and was blown away by Moebius' artwork, interested in hearing what different tastes/styles people are into-   Super impressed with what the illustrations look like in Blacksad and Mouse Guard, looking forward to checking them out.   That article pretty much completely sold me.  Also Blacksad...cannot wait to get this, artwork is looks stunning.   I bought the first one a couple weeks ago and haven't dove in yet, looking forward to it.   Wow....artwork looks amazing.    Yeah I had that recommended to me earlier and am very intrigued.   Reviews I'm reading for it are through the roof, thanks for the suggestion.   Nice I'll check out Superman. Have been reading others praise for Nightly News and Pax, both look great.   Definitely going to hit up Moore's other works, Kingdom Come looks awesome, thanks.   This looks fantastic. Any suggestions on where to find a copy? Amazon doesn't seem to have much...   I'm new to the comic book scene, and have recently been engrossing myself in the more iconic graphic novels (alan moore and frank miller).   I care a lot more about the writing/illustration quality, moreso than the subject matter itself that's being dealt with. Not too sure what direction to look in for this, or how to narrow down my choices, hoping this community would have some suggestions for me.  I'm currently reading Watchmen which I love, and have heard many great things about the Sandman series.   Ha, yeah probably the best mindset to have.   Yeah, that is pretty ridiculous   Haha!  What are you retarded? Of course I'm Godamn Frank Miller!   Nice, thanks!   Nice, looking forward to checking it out.   Yeah this is what intrigues me so much about it. Reinterpreting a character is a very interesting exercise, and it's pretty much impossible to do without alienating fans, especially for a someone as iconic as Batman.     Maybe it's because I don't have any attachment to the character due to my inexperience reading these, but casting him as almost an antihero is super intriguing.  What were your thoughts of TDKR? There's dialogue in there quite similar to the screenshot you posted.   Yeah that's pretty disappointing to hear.   Any critics in particular that you'd recommend? I've been reading a lot of reviews for different comic books but it's hard to gauge how in line my taste is with the respective critics.   Cool, thanks for the reply!   Appreciate the feedback, very well written and interesting. Your last sentence in particular I find fascinating, because if he pulled off a "Sin City in a Batman cowl" it would appeal to me greatly. Any suggestions for graphic novels that might be in this direction?   Honestly this makes it appeal to me even more.   I'm new to comics and recently finished TDKR series and Year One. I loved both, blown away by them. Both of the series I mentioned in my title apparently received quite negative reviews. I plan on reading them, but am curious how this community feels as to why there was such low reception. Some of what I have read is that Batman is depicted as being too dark/gritty, bordering on a psychopath, but to be honest that makes these appeal to me even more.

I have had a difficult time finding efficient ways to convert .mkv files into manageable files that I can easily edit. Many of the instructions I have found seem quite round-about.      I've got a couple weeks of funemployment coming up and would like to spend as much time out of the apartment as possible. Any suggestions on activities to partake in/places to explore?  Game 7 tonight let's go rangers!   For those that don't remember Sean Hoare was the whistleblower in the NewsCorp phone hacking scandal back in 2011.   Dude's a pussy.      Basically, a book that is as close to the film Eyes Wide Shut as possible.      Do you happen to know the exposure details you used?   Matt Moore   A top prospect they has/is coming up. Kris Bryant, Byron Buxton, Carlos Rodon...a top, young player. If I were you I'd hold on to him though, dude looks like a stud.   Let me start by saying I don't even agree with the suspension, I think this whole thing is overblown. But if an "independent source" isn't actually independent, it matters considerably. Imagine if the NFL had originally said they didn't pay Wells for the report and that a did it on his own.   This isn't to rant about the quality difference between 3D/The way it was meant to be seen, if you're into the gimmick that's your thing. I'm in the NYC area and every theater only offer IMAX with 3D, people from other areas having the same issue?   Fair point, but this is still significant.      Cool thanks, what genre would you describe them as?   Good to know- thanks   I find that a lot of techno songs quickly devolve into something with a loud thumping base throughout the entire track.

 Teamwork!    Just adding to what happyjoylove said.  Next time you decide to use a ton of liquid oils just make sure you do a steep water discount.

My insurance is offering full body CT scans and a few of my coworkers have had it done.  I'm wondering if these scans are safe and how accurate they really are.  I really don't want extra radiation if it's not necessary.  What do you guys think?     That would be such a cool Halloween costume!    Hi Fanky1356, I'm guessing that you're 17 and you really have a long time ahead of you to figure out stuff like that.  Only through more life experience will you then figure out who you really are.  I'm in my early 30's and I still surprise myself.  Try to enjoy your life and do as much traveling as you possibly can :)   A strong flushing toilet.  Just came back from a road trip and we stayed at 5 different Airbnbs.  There's nothing better than your own toilet at home :)   Garden tomatoes taste so much better.  I never really appreciated eating a tomato raw until I had one fresh from the garden.   BACHANNAL!!!  That's the only buffet I've been to where I wished I had another stomach to eat more food.

Ronny Chieng is pretty hilarious too.   Pockets! Perfect for holding small items and a nice resting place for your awkward hands.   That's what cell phone games are for :D   I want to know who stared at the dogs asshole long enough to notice it, and then brave enough to point it out.   The photos of women and men they use for advertisements.  As a person that has shot and retouched for a living.... trust me.  Nobody looks like that naturally.

I can eat it every day if it wasn't for the crazy amount of sodium in it.   French fries.  Always french fries.     The thumbnail photo made it look like you were fingering air... lol.

 I have a similar situation at my school, I can make recommendations but a parent can override me. I have a student who is intelligent enough to do the work but has no work ethic he will make a c in my class. He will fail ap English and make a cs and bs  in his other classes . we have all recommended he take cp next year but his dad insist he take honors class. It sucks because it really throws the who dynamic of the class off.   Hahaha that's fantastic   I have a masters degree a great job stable relationship several interesting hobbies I probably smoke less than the average ent  but I still smoke. Rarely drink life is good happy 4/20   I think baby sunscreen has an obvious white cast so parents can see where they apply it   When someone says irregardless  I kind of hate them . it isn't a real word and if I correct you I am a dick   We have a winner take all system meaning that if one guy gets 49%of the vote and the other guy gets 51% then he gets the seat in congress for his district. So smaller parties never have a chance to win a portion of the seats like they do in other countries. Also the bigger parties often take the ideas of smaller parties so there is no need to vote for them.   Man that sucks sorry you had such a bad time with them. I lived across the street from them when they opened up on spring street and was so sad when they moved to King street.    Black bean has some good wraps and some of the best vegan cookies in town . it isn't amazing but good for a quick bite.   Hey fellow Charleston vegan couple of places to check out delz up town,  black bean co, co Asian restauraunt, octobachi, fig and Macintosh have great veggie plates and butcher and bee mez plate is great too. Let me know if you have any questions .    In a similar situation needed to read this so badly because some days I feel like the distance will never end.   Depending on where you live tour guide could be a viable option. Camp counselor during the summer and somewhere like they boys and girls club during the year. Or you can try and sub it out for another year. Best of luck.   I went to an eating disorder clinic many years ago not as a vegan but as a vegetarian. When I checked in I was allowed to list 3 things I wouldn't eat I chose chicken beef and pork (I figured they wouldn't serve much fish and I was right) after three days of complying with the menu they gave me I was allowed to  choose the foods I wanted as long as they met my dietary requirements so I actually never ate meat while I was there had yoghurt a couple times and eggs once when I didn't get to choose. I hope this helps put you at ease a bit . I have been in recovery for 6 years its a hard battle but I am much happier now than I was back then. If you want to talk inbox me.   Yeah my family stopped asking after about 10 years crazy that it takes a decade for your family to take you seriously. I always think , if I had changed my diet to lose weight and lost 50 lbs would they ask if I had gotten fat yet?    The same thing happened to me ...its be 17 years so not just a phase I suppose .   Opportunity cost is it worth it to loose the person you are with to experiment? It may be but it might also do a lot of damage. I feel like some times my bisexuality starts kicking in when I am unhappy in my current relationship and instead of dealing with it I start fantasizing about the sex I am not with.  I am very happy with who I am dating now and even though I have attraction to both sexes it isn't something I want to act on. Not saying this is what is going on with you but just thought I would share my experience.   Your options would probably to bus tables at a restaurant and work your way up. Unless you know someone it is unlikely they will pay you to learn to be an electrian . Charleston is a popular city and jobs can be difficult to come by especially down town. In the city a one bedroom will run you 700$ to 1200$. Their is a party scene here so if you are looking to grow up it also might not be the best place. Not trying to be negative but just trying to be honest. Best of luck what ever you decide.   OK sorry didn't mean to step on toes   Unfortunately sex Ed usually falls to PE teachers instead of science teachers. So there is a gap in knowledge .    Its pretty common to make jokes in any stressful situation. It bands people together and makes the stress more manageable. Its called gallows humor , not soulless completely normal human reaction .   I am currently cf and have always kind of been neutral about it. I never desperately wanted kids and I never felt like I would hate having them  either. I kind of always thought well if it happens it happens. So when were you sure you didn't want kids?   Letters mean more than you can imagine, they are by far my favorite gift! I had a student give me a book that they thought I would enjoy which was really sweet as well. Congrats on graduation I am sure your teachers are proud.   This is actually a great interview question because it gives you insight into someone's knowledge of what is acceptable behavior for the work place   Oh I thought he was talking about a section hike . Yes find a person who can care for your pets for that length of time.    You could pay a neighbor to take care of them (this is what I do) they already live right next door so it isn't too inconvenient, and they can make some cash. Or you could pay to board them in a kennel.    I read a little history of the world and watched some crash course us and world history videos to brush up on some of the things I hadn't studied in a while. Wasn't too bad look at the practice test it was very similar to the actual test.   Yes people need to be their own advocate , but just like asking someone who you don't know is pregnant if they want to sit is a bit uncomfortable , so is asking someone to give up their seat so you can sit.   Yes you should give up your seat to anyone who is in need... pregnant, elderly, disabled, here take my seat. For no other reason than it is the right thing to do. You can not like kids and still like people. And I am sure I will get down voted to hell for saying this but sometimes this sub is less about being child free and more about hating kids. I like kids I don't have them because I like my freedom more . pregnancy is difficult for most women and if I can ease someone's suffering a bit by standing on the metro then I will.   For anyone who is interested in a non harmful way to trap  a mouse I used something like this when I was in Africa a few years ago http://m.instructables.com/id/Simple--No-Kill--Mouse-Trap/   I thought it was a museum but I wasn't sure. I just think it is so cool that they left them up and the little flower garden on the other side is so sweet.   You look lovely, so fresh and dewy.I have been using their powder for years and love it but now I am in my late twenties and it started setting I to my fine lines. I just bought the liquid foundation and it still has the same glow and doesn't break out my sensitive skin.    It is beautiful but I have always found plantations to be off putting because of all the suffering that took place there.    There is this park right at the corner of Calhoun and Rutledge (Cannon Park)  it has these amazing columns that are left over from a building that burned down it is really beautiful and not a typical Charleston proposal spot.     This made me so happy ! I think that is such a creative solution.    That's kind of what I have going right now and it works OK. I was actually thinking about getting a small tackle box to put everything in , but it just seems really bulky   Hey MUA I have been following this sub for a while and my make up skills and collection have greatly improved. I was wondering if anyone has a make up bag that they love. I travel pretty regularly and would like something that can hold most of my make up but isn't huge. Any advice would be great.  	35
    Ly-man Zer-gaaaa   We got a grease man.    Do I start Gio Gonzalez tonight against the Mets or Anibal Sanchez tomorrow against the Royals    It's beautiful seeing us play well and beating Boston. Most of my friends are Red Sox fan and they all said we would be dead last in the AL East and that this is the worst Yankees team in a long time. It's lovely to see us in first place, even if it's only the second of May.   You just gotta work at it. It sounds like you need to work with adding, subtracting and dealing with negatives. That's the base you need to build to regain your math. Trust me, it's possible you just need to be determined to do it. I used to hate math, but I realized that I need it for what I want to do after college and this really helped. In my free time I would work on building my basic math and I've tried to stop using a calculator all together and it's pretty spectacular how far I've come. I started in remedial math level courses in college and now I can do some multi step problems in my head.

It was a blessing in disguise having him gone last year    Ron Coomer, Raul Mondesi and not so obscure, but Ruben Sierra   I have xbox 360 so sadly I can't play the show. I'm wondering which MLB2k game offers the best franchise mode. I'm just wondering overall, because I have MLB2k10. I'm at the all star break and there are 7 pitchers with a sub 4 era. In the 2010-11 real MLB season there were 11 guys with a sub 3 era and roughly 25 with a sub 4 era. My main concern is stat simulation realism I guess.   THANK YOU   The first game of the season I went to was our win against Boston and you could tell the fans knew he was gonna knock in some runs in his first at bat. If he hits over 275 and knocks in 20+ hrs I would say he's had a successful season and I'm sure most Yankee fans that want the team to win and do well this season are supporting him.   So 2k10 would be better than 11,12 or 13   Yeah 360   The earliest I've played was 2k6 I loved it   The Show is really the best I know. Sadly I've got xbox 360    So I currently have MLB2k10 and playing franchise upsets me because I'll notice the league leaders in ERA will have an era over 3.50 and only a few guys will be under 4.00.  I'm really just trying to figure out if there's a mlb2k game out there that doesn't have these issues   Well I actually love Arod now :( and I don't think I ever saw a video of it outside of sport center the next day. They didn't say anything about it, you could barely make it out. It was against the Braves. It was either 05 or 06   Honestly she could win. Remember the anger in her eyes when Kenneth ate the teamsters sub? Those were the eyes of a killing machine!    Well someone could make the argument that we've never had a good president. I wouldn't agree with that, but the point I'm trying to make is that it certainly isn't unanimous that W was the worst president ever. I'm sure if we had a nationwide vote W would win, but that's only due to the recency of his presidency and the likes of Jon Stewart.

 I was asked by my aunt to film my cousins engagement. My question is should I use a Glidecam or a shoulder mount? I haven't used either before but I need to be mobile.   Also, what are some tips or advice you can give me? I've never done videography before, just fictional shorts.    Do they have a number? Or do I need to go there?   How come they aren't in sync with what they show? It seems like they contradict each other, sending mixed messages. One says this is appropriate and the other says it isn't. Who makes up the FCC and the MPAA?      I think all the movies you listed are great. And I think Memento should be there with them. Like I said, a true film buff like yourself doesn't think Memento is a bold film, but the vast majority of average moviegoers do. So I guess we'll just have to agree to disagree.   What would you consider difficult? It seems like you only consider a movie difficult if it's emotionally difficult, which is also a low bar.   The Maze Runner. I thought it'd be another bad young adult novel turned movie kind of thing. Went with a friend and I actually liked it a lot and thought it was a well made and above average. The ending got a little wonky I thought, but other than that I liked it!   The Tree of Life. I don't know how you guys feel about it, but I personally don't know anyone in my life who thinks it's good. That movie's a masterpiece.   It's hard to compare the two because Fight Club is this weird combo of surreal comedy/drama whereas The Game is a psychological thriller. I feel like The Game is more accessible to wider audiences because it's easier to get in to. It has a, for the most part, straight forward story that, while there may be a lot of twists, it's still easy to follow what's going on.  While on the other hand I find Fight Club harder to recommend to people because of how strange it is. It breaks the fourth wall, jumps around in time, lots of narration, it's very cynical, satirical, dark humor, at times offensive, and other times brutally violent all while maintaing this overall sense of humor and satire. I love it more than The Game, but The Game is much easier to digest. And because it's a lesser known Fincher film, I feel you'd have a better time finding people to watch it with that don't know about it, whereas Fight Club? Pretty much everyone knows about it.  All in all I like Fight Club more and think it's better than The Game, but I go to them for different reasons because they are different. While they are both good WTF movies. Fight Club only gets WTF towards the end while The Game is WTF pretty much throughout. Also, I find The Game to be Fincher's least Fincher movie, but that's just me.   Wait, so I don't remember anything from when Memento released. Was that pretty popular with audiences when it came out? Cause I didn't see it till years later and it didn't strike me as an entertaining popcorn flick.   The Master is not a bold film at all. It's great, but not bold.   By your logic then, Memento could totally hang with the likes of those films. You say what makes the movies you listed "bold" is that they demand something from the viewer. Memento totally demands the attention of the viewer as well as multiple viewings if you want to truly understand it all. You said Nolan isn't difficult or bold. Maybe to a lover of film like yourself. But to the general public he is. I know plenty of people that cannot sit through Memento or Inception because of the complexity of those films. To the average moviegoer, these films hurt your head to think about and they aren't the kinds of movies you can just turn your brain off for.   I think it's an instant classic. I think it will stand the test of time because there is nothing really modern about it. It's a movie that doesn't have a lot of modern technologies so it could've been made any time. It also feels like an old school Clint Eastwood "Man with no name" kind of movie. Sixty years from now we'll look back and go, "Yep, still a great movie."   I think it's different with GTA because while you have the option to do it, it's still just an option. It's not the point of the game. But with Hatred that's the entire objective of the game.    David Fincher - The Social Network  Christopher Nolan - The Dark Knight(Hopefully Interstellar will change that)  Quentin Tarantino - Inglorious Basterds  Nicolas Winding Refn - Drive(Maybe, just maybe, Only God Forgives)  Terrence Malick - The Tree of Life  The way I did this was by picking my favorite Directors and picking which movie shows all of their tricks and techniques they've developed coming together and being perfected.    I still have a lot to see but so far...  The Rover  The Drop  Guardians of the Galaxy  Edge of Tomorrow  The Raid 2  The Lego Movie  The Grand Budapest Hotel  X Men: Days of Future Past  22 Jump Street  Dawn of the Planet of the Apes  Under the Skin  Gone Girl   There is a video I love but haven't been able to find. The video is of a guy in a fast food place saying something about fighting. He then puts on his motorcycle helmet and wraps one arm around his head, and flails the other arm. All of his friends then start laughing. It was also filmed on a phone. I have no idea what it was called and I cannot find it anywhere. Help?   I just wanna see Birdman. It's apparently not playing anywhere in or around the city. What's up with that?  We get The Guest which is a super small indie film, heck we get small indie films all the time, why wouldn't we get a star studded film that has gotten critical acclaim?  Is it the theater choosing not to show it or is it the film distributer not wanting to show it here?  Just thought it was super weird. Memphis theaters are always unpredictable when it comes to indie films, but I thought Birdman would surely be here.   Anyone know of any place that is showing it that I'm just unaware of? I only checked Malco and Ayjay cinemas. Are there any other movie theaters in or around the city?   I think you're both right. Everyone should stop listening to/reading biased opinions and do their own damn research. This goes for everything.   In Mormonism they are taught everyone goes to Heaven. There is no Hell, just different tiers of Heaven.    This is misinformation, Mormons don't believe in a hell so there's nothing they can damn you to.   I glanced over the doc(I'll read more in depth latter) and most of that stuff I'm aware of and hasn't really affected me. I'm definitely aware of the LGBT issues due to my cousin being gay. I can't say I agree with their stance on that. I think that since I'm aware of most of this stuff it doesn't affect me. By that I mean I don't agree with most of it and I don't act out any of it. None of the stuff really directly affects me. Now if I was a woman, it'd be different because of how much it *would* directly affect me.   Also, the last part bothered me. The part about only Mormons go to heaven and if you leave, you never see your family again. To the best of my understanding, that's entirely false. Everyone goes to heaven. There is no hell. The only thing is what level of heaven you go to. You will for sure see your family again even if you leave, because the family that stays will be able to visit you as often and as long as they want. You can travel to the lower tiers, you just can't travel to the upper tier(s) if you reside in the lower one(s). At least, according to the teachings.  Like I said, I'll continue to read more to inform my opinion better.  But I do want to thank you for the discussion. And I wish you the best as well.   The thing is though, is that I don't want to know if it's made up. In fact, I kind of just don't care if it's made up or true. If I leave, I'd rather it be because it's not right for me because of the way I live. I don't want to learn it's made up *because* my loved ones believe it. I wouldn't want to know it to be false and have my family believe it to be true at the same time. That would make things harder for me deal with. I've never been the kind of person to create friction. I wouldn't want *them* to start questioning it as well, because they're happy believing it.   I've thought about my future constantly from both sides. How would it be if I wasn't Mormon? How would it be if I was? I can honestly see myself happy in both scenarios. But I can also see myself being unhappy in both as well. So I just take it day by day and have just decided to go with it. Let fate push and pull me where it must.  The way I see it, I'm happy with how I'm living now. I've found some weird equilibrium and for now, I'm okay with it.   By the way, I wanted to ask you something. I was afraid to ask earlier because I was afraid you would think I was being snarky, but now that things are diffused, What's with your username? If you don't believe, then why that username?   I never once said that what was posted was anti Mormon. I also don't blindly follow this religion. I've seen a bunch of different perspectives. Heck, half my family isn't Mormon. If you were to watch me go through one day of my life you'd see that I'm not a good Mormon. I'm pretty much Mormon in name only. Yeah I don't do drugs or smoke or drink but that's just a personal thing that I've never been in to. But I do and support many things the church doesn't. You and I are not the same. You weren't in my shoes. I'm not saying your experience doesn't hold any value, but people have different lives. Things vary person to person. You said we were taught that questioning the church is a sin. I was never taught that. I was always told it was normal and it was up to us to do the research and figure out for ourselves if it was true or not.   I'm always struggling with religion. Honestly maybe I don't care if it's true or not. Maybe I like believing there is a God. Believing in an afterlife and great plan for everyone. I stay Mormon not because I'm worried what other Mormons think, but because of my family. I mean they love and support me no matter what, even if I did leave, but there would still be disappointment. I also enjoy the community of the church. I go to the singles branch so no one there is pushy or preachy. They're all really cool and nice people that are around my age that are fun to talk to.   I know you never said this, but I just wanted it to be clear that I'm not a hardcore devout Mormon blindly following a religion I know nothing about. I'm simply an impostor playing pretend because it's the easiest thing to do right now. Playing pretend until I can discover how I really feel on my own. I consider everything and rule nothing out. That's why I look at both sides. Yeah I may not do a lot of reading. I never said that was a good thing. I wasn't bragging about it. It's a flaw and I will have to read a lot to discover how I really feel. I realize everything I just said may seem hypocritical and might null everything I've said in previous comments, but that's the honest truth.   I'm just a dude on the internet.      Well for one I never claimed to know the absolute truth. And I never said I was more right than a Jew or Catholic. I'm just a dude on the internet who likes movies and doesn't like reading.   I also never claimed anything specific to be anti Mormon. Like you said, I probably never read the stuff you talked about. So it didn't really make since to me why you'd bring that stuff up when I never claimed anything specifically, and especially not the stuff you brought up, to be anti Mormon or hostile. It was all kind of irrelevant. You asking me what about all those publications is hostile is a weird question when I didn't say any of them were. You simply asked me to define "anti Mormon". So I did.    I guess people or things that aggressively oppose Mormons or Mormonism with hostility? I personally use it to describe things that are hostile and aggressively opposed to it. It's fine to oppose something, it's when it gets aggressive and hostile I'd start using the term "anti". Technically, you can totally be anti anything and not be aggressive which is perfectly fine. So long as no one is getting mentally, emotionally, or physically hurt. I didn't mean what was posted was anti Mormon (I didn't read it obviously) or you or anyone here specifically. I was just saying I read that stuff all the time. I mean you come across that stuff frequently on the internet often so you can't really avoid it. And I don't really try to avoid it for that matter. Like I said, I'll read anything, anti Mormon or not, as long as it's not too long. Or I find it interesting. So I guess I should correct myself, I hate reading unless it's something I truly find interesting or love, like film. I could read for hours about movies.    Well I mean 1) Your reply was one line. 2) it directly pertains to me because you're talking to me. So of course I did. I'd happily read anti Mormon stuff if it's like a paragraph at most. I don't have a problem reading things that question Mormonism so it's not an "ignorance is bliss" thing, it's a "I don't like reading so the longer it gets, the less likely I'll read it" thing.    Thanks, the way I've always viewed it, despite whatever I believe religiously, and whether I think it's true or not, I've always had a firm belief that church and religion should be separate from government and not influence laws and what not.   Naw not really. I just hate reading. That's a pretty popular feeling among the general public. I find it funny it's so hard for you to believe that I'm just a super lazy person who hates to read. Like I said before, if you ask me "why" I don't care to read it, I'll tell you why.   I'm sorry to hear that. My cousin is in the same situation and it's far from easy. In my comment that was a reply to your comment I was just trying to understand. I'll say you should definitely talk to your ex about it, which you might have done already because you're concerned about your daughter. But I don't know anything about your life so I'mma just shut up now.   Either your favorite current commercial that's recently been on tv, or just any one from your past that has stuck with you.    Never said I was temple worthy. I don't pay tithing. I'm not a good Mormon. I agree with you that it's not right to group the Mormons together as people because they're different person by person. That's been my problem with this thread. There's a bunch of people in here saying that Mormons are bad people and "love bombers" and malicious. I'm okay with people having problems with the church as a whole and certain individual Mormons, but when you start grouping them together and call me terrible because I'm Mormon that's when I get upset. I'm not like most Mormons because of my family. I have a gay cousin that I love and half my family isn't Mormon so I was raised to never judge people based on their religion but who they are as a person.   I was downvoted earlier just because I told someone there are great people who happen to be Mormon and said that I was Mormon as well and just wanted everyone to be treated equally. Why? Who knows. I wasn't being dishonest, I was respectful and polite and non aggressive.   My motto has always been "Live and let live. Don't worry about what other people are doing unless it directly affects you."   Eh, who cares what the church tells your daughter. You're her parent. You are the one who should be doing what's best for her. You say you don't like what they're teaching her, but if you aren't doing anything about it then you are part of the problem. Do something about it because like I said YOU ARE HER PARENT! You don't like what they're telling her? Don't let her go. The solution is there. If she's in primary then she is younger than 10, which makes me ask, if you don't like it, why take her? And if you aren't taking her, then who is?   No, I haven't. The reason is that I simply don't care to read it. If you ask me why I don't care or any other question, I'll definitely answer your question. But that's the simple answer: I just don't care. I'm not saying that to be a blind follower, I say that because I mean I don't care enough to read that much. I've just never been a reader in my life so when I saw how many pages I groaned, but I did read the first 8 pages. But like I said, if you ask me why I don't care or any other question, I'll answer it without a doubt. It just won't be in a timely manner because reddit won't let me do anything because of how many of my comments have been downvoted lately, but I'll answer!   I haven't thrown any money to Prop 8 or anything.    You know how people hate it when a religious person tries to push their religion and beliefs onto them? That's what this thread kind of feels like, but with the roles reversed.   Now the non religious people are pushing their disbelief onto others.  It's all the same. We're all just as terrible.   This will sound stupid, but religion isn't about believing with your brain, but with your heart. Religion isn't about finding out if it's factually accurate, it's about faith. And it is up to the individual to choose to have faith or not. See, I always thought the people who call Joseph Smith a con man and call Mormonism a hoax are just as bad as the religious people who push their religion on others. It's the same thing, but instead of pushing their beliefs, they're pushing their disbelief onto others. People should just live and let live. Someone believes in something you don't? Who cares. You think it makes them an idiot? Who cares. I'm sure we all have more important things to deal with than worry about what someone else believes in. I'm not talking bout you specifically, relevantlife, I'm talking people in general including me.  I find myself constantly struggling with my beliefs, but in my experience, yeah I've seen people have a bad experience with Mormons and the religion, but I've also seen people's lives change for the better as well. Just like any religion or belief or whatever. But what do I really know? I'm just a person.  We are all just people. We can't prove (a)God exists and we can't prove (a)God doesn't exist, so that means we are all just arguing about who's hypothesis is better, which is why religious debates are so dumb.   If it means anything, there are some great Mormon people out there. I'm Mormon and just want everyone to be happy and treated equally with the same rights. I support a *lot* of stuff the church as a whole doesn't.  Edit: Kinda sucks that I'm being downvoted just for saying that I support equal rights and happen to be Mormon.   Don't you *ever* try to tell me how to live my life again.   This makes me think of how great the use of CGI is in Fincher's films. His CGI is never really in your face and is mostly subtle, which is why it's so great. If you watch his VFX breakdowns on his movies, you'd be surprised at what's CGI!   First I want to say I'm relatively new to DSLR filming. So I've been noticing a lot of noise when I do low light shooting. I believe I'm doing a good job at lighting dark scenes and having the right camera settings, but even still, I'm noticing lots of noise. Even when I use lenses that are great in low light situations. Are t3i's typically bad at low light situations and generally produce a lot of noise?  What are some good ways to prevent, battle, or fix noisy footage? And should I just invest in a better camera?   I'm late replying, but since no one else said it, if you super jump off of an edge you won't receive any fall damage. I super jump off of skyscrapers all the time and it feels awesome!    I was just saying that the piano scene was just a good scene in general, not specifically the cinematography, although I do think Spring Breakers is a beautifully shot film despite the quality of the film itself, which I like. And I do agree that Prisoners was beautifully shot. You might like [this](http://mattscottvisuals.com/blog/2014/1/10/-what-are-you-looking-at-disecting-the-work-of-a-master). It's a breakdown and examination of Prisoner's cinematography.   That piano scene though   Thanks! I sent you a PM   I was wondering when you'd show up!   Hey thanks for the reply! I sent you a FB message   It's Saturday at 10 am. Like I said, super short notice   As it says in the title, I have a short film scheduled to shoot on Saturday and my actor bailed. The equipment is already rented and props are bought. I could really use a miracle here. I don't even care if you're an actor or not. If you believe you can act and can appear menacing, please give it a shot.  If you volunteer please know it's unpaid(I'm broke) and it *is* a main role so one other shooting day will be in the future(October 25th). After that you're done.   The role calls for a male actor. Age unspecified as well as race. The only thing is you have to look like someone in their late 20s or early 30s. Also, I can provide footage of the day 1 shoot to show we know what we're doing and this won't be a terrible home movie.  I'm in a terrible situation here and this is my last ditch attempt to save this project that has already been started and has had the heart, soul, blood, sweat, and tears of other people poured into it. Help?   Isn't she blind?   Preferably practical effects and make up and not cgi? Like videos that show ow they did something?   I'd like to consider myself a non-alcoholic drink connoisseur. I like trying new, different, unique drinks! Then I collect the bottles/cans!  I live in Tennessee, so I can exchange pretty much any american foods, or American foods specific to the south!    It's a French phrase that translates to "something something void"  Help!   The Tree of Life, The Matrix, Drive. Watchmen coming in as a close fourth.    Need some scrap and junk!   Like an actor/actress who was in some financially or critically successful movie and you thought to yourself, "They're going places!", but then their career sort of just fizzled out.   I didn't get into GTAIV until Gay Tony and the Lost DLC had already come out so I don't know how R* goes about releasing DLC info. I just thought it was kinda strange we hadn't heard a thing on any story DLC. Maybe I missed the news? Is this how R* usually is? When do they usually start releasing details for their story DLC? Just curious   Anyone have a mirror? Says the webpage is unavailable :(   I'm not saying dark is better. I just mean I appreciated Disney taking a risk and being ballsy with the Lone Ranger. The dude cuts out and eats another dudes heart. I do agree that there were bad tone shifts where it goes from dark drama to comedy adventure.    That navy ship segment in 3 Ninjas is really cool. As well as the paper mill segment in 3 Ninjas Knuckle Up    I also kind of appreciated how dark they went with the movie considering it's a Disney movie.      I feel lie this doesn't solve it because now, instead of waiting to see if one movie has a great ending, you're waiting to see if three movies have great endings.  You're still asking people to post a great ending movie, the only difference is that they are posting two other movies as well. You'll still be looking forward to the great ending, which is what you wanted to avoid. Only now you'll be disappointed two thirds of the time.    Jesus of Suburbia is still one of my all time favorite songs.      It's not though...it's a prop cigarette. It's the *exact* one I linked. I've used them tons of times in theater and shorts.    Fun Fact: The e-cig is actually a movie prop! It's a plastic cigarette and you screw in butt, and when you inhale, the end lights up. It's mostly for actors who do not smoke and wish to keep it that way. It's all just vapor!  Right here: http://www.newrulefx.com/spcig001.html    Without spoiling, is it bad?   Edge of Tomorrow - A Most Wanted Man - The Drop - Dawn of the Planet of the Apes  I have not seen these movies yet but I *do* want to see them. Because of where I live and how long two of them have been out, when Friday hits none of them will be playing here anymore. I want to catch them before they leave the theater.  I'm working and going to school this week so tomorrow/today(Tuesday) is my only free day. And because of the showtimes, I only have time to see three of them. This put me in a position to make a hard choice!  Which of the four, without spoiling things, can I eliminate and wait to see on Redbox or something? Which three are the must see ones? I realize this all depends on my personal taste, but what do you guys have to say?    Which was an outrage. Oklahoma chick did ventriloquism while singing. New York drummed on a solo cup.  Edit: Ohio not Oklahoma   Naw ventriloquist girl should've won   Not that I'm complaining. But I was just thinking about how many films today have synthy, 80s inspired scores and looks to them.   What movie started this? There was a time in 90s and early to late 2000s where most movie had typical cinematic scores and looks. But something changed and we started getting more and more films that have had their look and music inspired by the 80s.   You didn't mention it, but I wanted to say that GTA5 Online is pretty much zero fun unless you're playing with friends.   Another thing: I feel like most multiplayer games aren't fun by yourself now a days because everyone is in a party or private chat with friends so it's super quiet if you're playing alone   Really surprised to see Apocalypto on here. Love that movie and it's not one that's brought up often when talking about great films.   What parts did they get right/wrong?   The Matrix blew my mind when I saw it.    See I never understood this. It's like saying, "I wish I wasn't rich because all this money is weighing me down."  I had extremely bad acne when I was a teenager. Luckily it's cleared up, but the acne scars severely hindered my ability to grow facial hair. Couldn't grow a beard if I tried. Should consider yourself lucky that you at least have the option to grow your beard out or not. You don't *have* to shave because the worst thing that'll happen is you get a nice beard. I have to shave because if I don't, I get this really ugly, messy patchy "beard".    Just bought a suit and was wondering if any of you guys have found a good tailor who isn't crazy expensive   Just in time for the holidays.    "Damn you, Salizar. **DAMN YOU, SALIZAR!**"   Not the best movie but I regularly use this quote.    300 has my favorite shot from a film. This could be spoilers but near the end when Leonidas throws his spear there is a shot of the spear reflecting off of some gold stairs. You don't see the spear, you just see it's reflection as it travels over the steps. Beautiful shot!   Hey! I thought this post would've been dead by now! Glad you found it! I can't do anything this week due to a project, but next week, all week, I should be free.    Different game but you should check out Just Cause 2. That's the thing I loved most about that game. Three islands: one was all jungle and snowy mountains, one all desert, and one all city.    For real. I remember when the gtav trailer came out and it showed some hikers in the woods, that forest looked so dense.    A crime/drama about two criminals who escape the police by killing and stealing the identities of two hikers.   Really? Where at?   I might be willing to check it out    Yeah this expansion has taken out everything I liked about Saints Row. It's not about gangs or crimes, it's not even semi-realistic or believable, and now they took out customization. Man, I can't wait for saints row 5.    No that's what I want though. Not specifically dead kids, but that feeling you get when you're looking at something sexy then, the next thing you know, you just watched someone die.      I'm working on an editing project in Final Cut Pro and it is insanely important that I get Motion 4. It is imperative to my project. I can't find Motion 4 anywhere! Does it even exist anymore? Did it vanish? Is there any way to get it?!  I would use Motion 5 but it removed vital features I need for this project. Features that 4 *did* have. Help!   The ability to send from FCP7 to Motion   I'm working on an editing project in Final Cut Pro and it is insanely important that I get Motion 4. It is imperative to my project. I can't find Motion 4 anywhere! Does it even exist anymore? Did it vanish? Is there any way to get it?!  I would use Motion 5 but it removed vital features I need for this project. Features that 4 *did* have. Help!   Only if you tell people, shhh   Recently I've been really into the opening scene from The Player. It's like an 8 minute long shot that's really complex because in this 8 minute shot it perfectly sets up every side story in the movie. Great shot and great opening.    Alright I sent you a message!    Or just any cool empty industrial sites? Looking to do some urban photography. Would be cool if the had some "nature taking it back" look to them but not necessary.  Really just any abandoned or dilapidated urban environments.    You don't have to convince me. I've got my button and everything. Wolfskull won me over with his confidence and charisma.    Yeah I always felt the spirit of this subreddit was a "so crazy it just might work" sort of thing. But a lot of these posts as of late are just things that don't make any sense at all. The Wolfskull thread was awesome and refreshing but now everyone is so blatantly trying to copy it.    What was it about Matthew McConaughey that changed? It's no secret that lately McConaughey has turned into one of Hollywood's "go to" guy as of late. He has turned his career around and went from being a joke to being one of the most talented actors working today.   My question is, what was it that changed? Did McConaughey actually become a better actor, or did he just start choosing better movies?  I was watching Sahara, the adventure movie from 2005, and noticed that McConaughey himself hadn't really changed. It felt like the same Matthew that we are getting today. He still acted the same, yet I still felt like I was watching a not good McConaughey performance. I didn't *think* he gave a bad performance but it *felt* like a bad one, if that makes sense?   So when did this change in McConaughey happen? And was the change with himself and how he acted in projects, or was it simply he started picking better projects?   Do you know where Memphis is? It's quite literally on the border of both Arkansas and Mississippi. Crossing either one of those state lines would take me about 15-20 minutes at most from where I live. It's not like I'm driving across a state. I've done it before to see movies that weren't playing in my city.   Also, why are you even here if you're opposed to the idea of this subreddit?   Really not seeing the problem here. It's not like people will go over to each other's houses. People would be meeting at a theater which is a public place that is most likely to have a large crowd. Especially on a weekend. They'd also be driving separate cars. Honestly, this is no different from a simple reddit meetup. People do it all the time. I make short films and have used reddit to find and meet with local actors and crew members. This honestly is not rapey at all.    That's not very nice :(   Being an adult.   Man SF is fantastic. Too bad it's expensive to live there or I totally would move there. Working on saving up and building my resume. Maybe I'll make it over there. I wish your brother good luck on his endeavors. Maybe one day we'll meet and work together.    That I'll waste away my life doing nothing fulfilling or anything that makes me happy and I'll end up all alone and sad.  I want to get married. I want a family. I want a career I'll enjoy. Not getting these things scare me to death.   I'm cool.  My co workers and friends thin I am.   I know I'm not.  I have to keep them believing though.   /r/Movies, /r/Youtubehaiku, and /r/woahdude    Launch nuclear missiles because a couple of comedy actors from another country decided to make an over the top comedy movie about assassinating you.   Get out, it's past closing time! Get out of my store!  Or, Everything here is over priced. Go shop online.  Anything to get them out of my store really.   If they could never move out I'd choose Ryan Gossling so I could pitch him all my movie ideas and he could never leave.   Fuck you, every time I forget, someone brings it back up!   My future and how cloudy and unclear it is.   http://i.imgur.com/5wyLfIE.jpg   This girl is half his age?   Or alternatively, when *he* runs at *you* just turn around, bend over, and put your but on his penis.   What is this from?   When I was in high school some buddies and I went to shoot a video for our film class. We needed shots of planes taking off. So we thought it would be a good idea to go to our international airport and film planes taking off while we were on a dirt road that went between the runways. I was also wearing a ghillie suit.   The next thing we knew three suv's with fully tactical cops came driving up. They made us erase all of our footage. We explained to them what we were doing. We found out they were pretty cool and joked around with us, and even told us where we could go to get permission to film planes. Then they let us go.  That situation could have gone so bad but lucky for us we were dealing with some cool cops.   My hot neighbor sunbathing by the pool.  Nah, just kidding. It's almost always a spider in a web.   Nothing?   If only it were that easy. We live in a world where things keep getting more expensive and jobs that pay well are getting hard to find. Moving is never easy. Especially to a new city where you don't know anyone.  Trust me, the "Get the Fuck Outta Here" savings account exists, but it's only slowly growing.   Yeah, there we go! There was, I think, a tv movie about it, but if I remember correctly, it wasn't good.   Something that could be used and applied to almost any situation.   California making movies because it's my dream.   Seriously thought about it once. I wanted to just backpack across the country or something. Maybe move to a new place and start over.   "Now *this* is pod racing!"  Which is usually followed by R2D2's "WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO"   I convinced my friends fiance that I seriously thought I was immortal. We spent an hour talking about it. It was an Oscar worthy performance. I shed some tears and stuff. I don't think she believed that I was actually immortal, but I new she thought I was completely insane and needed help.   Still haven't told her the truth.   Podcasts, dude. Podcasts.   When my older sister acts like my second mother. "test_subject6208 do this, test_subject6208 do that. No, test_subject6208, you can't do that. Take out the trash and clean the bathroom, test_subject6208." Ugh.   ThisPlaceIsAFuckingPitOfNothingnessThatIsSlowingSinkingIntoTheEarth, TN.  Why? Because it is.   I forgot who the skaters were, but that story from the 90s about the two competing figure skaters and apparently one of them got her boyfriend to injure her competitor by hitting her in the knee with a rod. They were *huge* rivals.  Anyways, David Fincher needs to get on this ASAP   Interviewing myself. I like walking around the house or neighborhood asking myself questions as if an interviewer was talking to me like I was a famous person for doing something. Usually making or staring in a movie. I play both parts and ask myself what the filmmaking process was like and what obstacles I faced while making the movie. As someone who actually *does* make movies, it often helps me work out problems I might be having with production.  But yeah, I know other people talk to themselves, but I don't think they assume roles and play all the parts.   PS4. Bought one at launch. Definitely did not need it right then and could have waited a year. But I don't regret it because I enjoy using Netflix on it.   Elect Terry Crews as President of the United States. Shaquille O'Neal is a close second, though.   Myself.   Necessarily. I can *never* spell it. Ever. I don't now what should be a "C" and what should be an "S".   Because it's slow 10 months out of the year so all I do for 10 months is stand in one place and price things for 6-8 hours.   Doubt I'm tagged as anything, but if I am I hope it's not as bad as I think.   Really hoping this sub takes off. I'm off tuesdays, thursdays, and my weekends alternate. Usually get off work around 7:30. I'm pretty much always game for a movie.   What about r/SaveYouASeat?  I would totally use this subreddit, but I doubt anyone from my city would use it.   I've been to a couple of weddings in the past month and have seen different types, and my best friend is currently planning his wedding. It got me thinking. Wouldn't it be nice to be able to give people the wedding of their dreams?   Cloud Atlas?   That'd be great! I can email you the picture if you want to pm me your email   That piano scene tho      Sorry, totally slipped my mind. I'm using a canon rebel t3i.   My budget is like $200. Renting of course.    I don't know the quality of these items, so I'm looking for advice on if it's a smart buy.

I want to get some nice wide shots. I also need one that will not produce a lot of grain in the dark. Something that has great image quality in light and dark.  I'd be renting from [lensrentals](http://www.lensrentals.com/rent/canon/lenses/wide-angle) so from the options they have, which would be best? Which ones would be most versatile?   So is he implying that it will be like a 4 player co-op?   The Death Book-Ended one is interesting. How'd you come up with that?   It's a crime story about death.  [Here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0By3l0nVnUv1hU0t4aEFRc3pWTVk/edit?usp=sharing) it is   I'm writing a short. Need someone to give me a title.    Oh yeah I've seen it. But it's been a while. I actually bought it on dvd a long time ago. It was also I think the first movie I ever blind bought. Couldn't find it anywhere then I just ordered the dvd. It's been one of my favorites since.   	153
 I regularly get surprised or thrown off looks when I thank people for small things, even in my family. Growing up in London, queueing and apologising profusely is what we are great at and so in China, I often get told by my uncle to stop apologising so much.   True dat   Aren't these basically it with the fillings adapted?   Guess I have my saturday night plans sorted   Ahh the Snail Bee essence has niacinamide too, how do you find it?  I love the recovery gel cream BTW, its heavenly, especially when I'm travelling in the summer.   The Mizon Intensive Night Repair Ampoule also has niacinamide too ;)   Do you use any other actives?   How long can you get wear out of them before they start coming off? I'm looking for a long lasting liquid lipstick too and I think I might have to resort to the LA Girl or LA Splash ones, comparable to Stila Stay All Day and Limecrime Velvetines.   Yup, they do but its the old packaging.... so maybe older batches?   I have Instanaturals' Vit C serum and honestly wouldn't recommend. I bought it due to it being the top seller on Amazon but man, it did absolutely nothing for my skin. After 3 months, I have seen no improvement wit PIH and I don't think they hyaluronic acid has done anything for me either.  In terms of pH, L-AA forms of Vit C are most effective, but oxidise very quickly and will react with niacinamides to cause flushing.    Is it possible that they are heat rashes? If so, go to your local supermarket or pharmacy and ask for 'fei zi fen= ' I know Johnson's baby do one and it comes in a pouch (like a yoghurt pouch) and apply this on the areas and areas of high humidity like armpit, inner elbows, back of knee.  When I was younger, going to the south like Si Chuan and Jiang Su always broke me out in heat rashes as I couldn't acclimatise to the humidity or heat.   Sure, always happy to help a fellow ABer! Especially a UK one, there are much fewer of us here on this sub.  I do find that even with shipping, RRS tends to work out to be cheaper. I usually add things to cart, find costs of shipping and average it out per item and add this cost on and compare it to the shops with free shipping.   If its your first order, I would recommend Jolse, purely because of the $3 store credit. Also, if you're buying a bunch of items from a specific brand, Jolse has 10% sales on certain brands every week- this week its Holika Holika and Innisfree. I guess you could split what you're buying this way as well if you don't mind having shipments every week.   Yep I do, I don't usually need one though unless I'm doing more than 3 coats.  I tried this one today and found that no wiggling and just having 1 coat makes it much better. I'll try layering this one up with other mascaras to keep testing   Yup!! Its one of the more popular online AB stores due to the lower prices of products (but high shipping costs)   Yeah definitely! I bought these products to target PIH specifically, I am using a SAP for Vit C but have seen no result after 3 months so wanted to buy some things with niacinamide to help brighten my scars   Well, I suppose the update was rebranded as a 're-opening'. I bought this as soon as the new website was live      Cat's Eye Pizza is pretty decent if you're feeling that faux hipster, young gen vibe. Their potato waffles and platters are good, plus you get free wifi   Eat: any street food- AHBVIOUSLY, one of Ba Da Lou if it's a family gathering   Do: Play bridge with old wise guys, Yu Yuan Tan or just wander around  See: walking around parks after dinner, bad football at Gong Ti   Thanks! I'll definitely give this a go, I want it to be good so badly   I have ordered from RRS and Jolse and would definitely recommend them both, purely for ease of service (especially now RRS has made their website easier to use) and no problems with shipping and customs/VAT issues. I always pay for K-Packet Area 3 and it gets here within about 10 days or so, which is fairly decent.   RRS's shipping fees are quite steep but you can avoid this by buying on eBay (tracking costs $2.50) but you can't add things to our basket and pay for them all in one go, so I still prefer their website if I'm ordering a bunch of items. I think paying for shipping on RRS is only worth it if you're buying a few heavier items.  Jolse also gives you $3 credit for just signing up and as shipping is free, they incorporate these costs into the item prices.  I have found both shops to undervalue their items by a lot and remember- EMS is a Customs/VAT issue honeytrap! Waiting a few more days and avoiding the hassle is worth it! Happy buying!!   Can I ask what other ones you use? I'll give the Kiss Me some more time but I really doubt it'll improve very much   Do you use the waterproof versions of those? We don't have the Full n' Soft waterproof in the UK, nor the L'Oreal telescopic :(   	22

 Wow thanks for the input and great ideas. I have been getting a lot of negative feedback from the ads so I will probably change that.   A lot of the flappy bird knock offs are pretty successful at the moment. Thought  I would give it a try also...   Thanks! I am just a dude trying to make money doing what he likes.   It's free...       You can't establish dominance with Hispanic women.      This reminds me of ice age.   What south park lied to me!   Working on my first one still. Should be out in a couple weeks. I have a friend I have known since highschool and he has had alot of success with this, so i figured i would try also.   Thank you so much!   What websites do the good people of reddit recommend for noob app developers.    They used carbon dating to date those trees. Carbon dating had been proven inconsistent.   Daft punk agrees   	14
 Actually you can with a brain scan. If you show a psychopath a picture of a starving child while getting a MRI brain scan the sections of the brain dealing with emotions will have little too no response.   An open mind is good but don't be so open minded your brain falls out.          What they don't realize is that the sleepwalkers are not interested in sites like reddit.   The gatekeepers are in the process of loosing there power. They are scared. Read book "The end of power" by Moises Naim. The centralized absolute power of the dark triad gatekeepers is becoming a thing of the past.   The new CEO must make reddit a safe place for future corporate advertisers.    Reddit is in the process of making this website a "safe place" for corporate advertisers.   "While not required". This is conspiracy section. Even if required I may break the rules. So f off bot.   https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/3dautm/content_policy_update_ama_thursday_july_16th_1pm/   Yea but it is in there best interest too do so. The bean counters will never learn.   If Reddit management had any commonsense, rather than getting rid of free speech to satisfy PC corporate advertisers they could run a fund raising campaign from its  users. PBS runs fundraising campaign for there ad free public television. Reddit should do the same. Harvard business school management style will not work with Reddit culture.    Reddit probably will keep conspiracy open. Classic misinformation tactic. Anyone who tell a truth that the powers that's doesn't want disclosed is a "crazy conspiracy nut".    The new CEO states that reddit was never a free speech forum and that reddit has  " dark side"   Yep.  "Learned helplessness" is not something the average uses of reddit is good at. F the gatekeepers. Have you seen the new "content policy".   Reddit use too be one of the few free speech zones that PC corporate culture didn't control. We need to give the new CEO hell for not respecting the wish of the vast majority of the users wishes.  We got rid of Chairman Pao, if the new CEO doesn't change fast I am going to start a petition asking for his removal.                The only reason reddit cares about it "dark side" is because they want to make this website safe for future advertisers. Everything is not about money. Got that new CEO.   This is how ex-chairman Pao must currently feel like.   I hope the new CEO realizes  how important free speech is too most people on reddit.   Most TV sucks.   The guy from South Africa who is going to replace Jon Stewart is not funny.         http://mrsafoundation.com/matthew-mcpherson/   Before I came up with my mrsa treatment method, I was given vacomycin on three different mrsa outbreaks. The nurses had to move the IV too a different spot every day due the vacomincin inflaming my veins.   Vacomycin is a strong antibotics and is hard on your system.         Not sure.            Old traditional media is dieing. People don't want to be told what to think.    The  gatekeepers of CNN are not happy with the fact that they can't control what is posted on reddit.             Thank you for link.       Thank you.          Yep most likely.   Are you going to continue to censor popular posts? My successful post in r/technology was deleted and the moderator was rude and was trolling me. My successful post had over 600 points in r/technology and I was deleted and censored. I want my post reloaded and I want you to tell moderator ProtoDong to quite being a rude censoring gatekeeper. https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/3bfy8j/after_getting_631_points_80_upvoted_117_comments/           	51
 Another thing: I don't think we can demand better moderation of the forums, since the nastiness was all over.   I have know idea who/what Vizard is, probably because I'm not involved enough in the community.   Are there any key points you want to extract from the interview since it might not be published?   Good to know, thanks.   Added.  Donations where 100% goes to the author may not even happen.  They might add a donate button if we push hard enough. That's why I'm advocating for a paid mods being a guaranteed certain level of quality by the developer so it is differentiated from donations.   That thing is an eyesore to read. Who was the interview with?   [Link to skyrimmods post.](http://www.reddit.com/r/skyrimmods/comments/343ym0/paid_mods_are_coming_whether_we_like_it_or_not/)  I'm new to the modding community, which means I only started playing Morrowind a year ago and Skyrim over the last six months. But like people have been saying a lot, recent events have inspired me to give back. As I have next to no money and not enough time to learn to mod extensively (even though I played around with it a bit in Morrowind), I was thinking about what's going to happen in the future. I realized two things:  1. Paid mods are coming, no matter how much we protest. The Valve press release was pretty clear about that.  2. Next time around, there won't be a community uproar at nearly the same scale. The Skyrim modding community is the biggest we have, another one won't be established by the time the next game is released. We can't stop the hundreds of thousands from buying the next Bethseda game, even if it is announced with paid mods.   Since we can't stop paid mods arriving, I think the best solution is to preemptively speak as a community to Valve and Bethesda about what we *do* want. Reading around the forums, I've noticed most people don't have a problem with paid mods **in theory**, as long as several key conditions are met. However, the implementation this time around was abysmal and we all realized nothing but slow (or not so slow) decline of mods would come from it.   So I have a radical idea. I think we should compile a list of the many sins that were committed, the problems they would cause, and improvements that would need to occur next time. We can present these to Valve/Bethesda as demands for the community to reluctantly support, or at least not condemn, paid mods. By conditioning our support on several key demands, we can make sure Valve sets up a marketplace that does not set off the disastrous effects we fear. Both parties would benefit: Since we can't stop paid mods, we could turn them into something which will have neutral or maybe even beneficial effects. Bethesda won't get the inevitable PR hit next time around, which is fresh in their minds right now and so holds the most power.  I've started small list below, and I think it would be great for the community to put together a comprehensive list and make it as official as possible. Hopefully this will be an opportunity to bring us together after the recent bitterness.  Here's my start, from what I've seen people saying.   Issues:  1. The way the marketplace was set up encouraged crap shovelware micro transactions over good mods. 2. There is no good way to test a mod and return it if it doesn't work. 3. There is no way to make sure that the modder will continue supporting the mod through main game updates and other mod changes.  4. Mods use one another assets all the time, which makes monetizing them a legal quagmire. In addtion, relying on modders and the community to police stolen assets in unworkable. 5. The paltry 25% the modders got was absolutely ridiculous. 6. The secrecy of the implementation runs counter to how the modding community functions. 7. Most of us using mods don't use the Workshop because of its limited functionality, meaning we can't access the mods posted like SkyUI 5.0.  Solutions:   **Quality**  /u/DiamondMind: A paid mod being on the marketplace means that the developer has endorsed it as unofficial DLC for the game and guarantee it. This legitimizes the cut they take and gives them a stake to supervise which mods have their name attached.   /u/DavidJCobb: All mods must have a seven day return policy, no questions asked and no consequences.  **User convenience**  /u/DavidJCobb: Load order managers and mod managers are essential to using mods while keeping one's game stable, but Skyrim doesn't natively support these tools, and the average Steam user won't know much about them. This is quite possibly the largest barrier to modding. Bethesda must develop their own analogues to LOOT and MO/NMM, and integrate these directly into the PC versions of FO4 and TES6.  Authors should be permitted to upload full archives, rather than a BSA/ESP pairing (the current limitation), but the uploading of loose files should be discouraged, and some sort of warning should be indicated to the user in the Steam Workshop's UI.  /u/DiamondMind: Do not tie downloads into the workshop; allow them to be used like Nexus files. That way, Bethesda and other developers do not need to create their own tool and force us all to use it.   **Compensation**  Modders need to get at least 50% of the sale. Valve and the publisher can work out how to split the other 50% on their own. There are more than enough differences between mods and other "industry practices" to allow this.  /u/NeuroticNyx: A donation button on unpaid mods on the Steam Workshop.  /u/MaryMudpie: A clearer system of Pay-As-You-Go for paid mods. For example, all prices are listed as "Recommended: $xx" on the main page and has a "Minimum: $xx" on the mod's individual page as well.   **Limitations on sale**  /u/DavidJCobb Mod authors should not be permitted to sell bugfixes for base game content, official DLC, or any other mods. These must be free. Obviously this policy must be worded in such a manner as to permit a mod author to continue selling a mod even if they must later release a bugfix for it; yet to forbid that author from releasing the bugfix itself as a separate paid product.  /u/DiamondMind: UI and other "fixes," not just bugs, should also never be sold.  **Theft**  If a mod author's resources are stolen and used in a paid mod, that author should be able to report that to Valve and have it acted on promptly. The thief's revenue should be transferred to the original author; or, if the author doesn't have payment details registered with Steam, the full amount should be held in escrow indefinitely, without a time limit, until it can be transferred to the original author.  In particular, we need assurances that Valve will pay attention to content that was originally uploaded to other sites, or at least to the more notable ones, when investigating theft reports. The full details of their policies regarding theft should be made public.  **Transparency**  Speak to us every step of the way, and release a prototype version first that we can check for issues.   This is of course unfinished, and there a lot more problems to address. Comment and I'll add it to the list!    Still won't work for paid mods, but I'll add it in another section.   I agree that Nexus should be more strongly pushing donations for the modders, and maybe take a 5% cut to keep the site running. (Seems like they're already doing it. If you download a mod, you get a donation pop up) However, this will NOT be a counter to payed mods, because as much as we want it differently only a fraction of people would donate, and Steam would look more attractive for the guaranteed money. So though I think Nexus' improvements are part of the solution, we have to work with Steam as well.  The reason I think it should go through the Nexus is because many of the most popular mods are improvements on the bugginess or lack of quality of the vanilla game. Bethesda should not be rewarded with revenue from the sale of SkyUI 5.0 after they did such a piss poor job with the original UI and didn't even bother to update it in a patch. They should not get money from a mod like CWO (not that Apollo would sell it, of course) that reintroduces content that was cut.  See my discussion with /u/DavidJCobb about what should and should not be allowed to be sold. I agree with you, but it is a grey area.   Best list I've found yet! I linked you in [my topic here](http://www.reddit.com/r/skyrimmods/comments/343ym0/paid_mods_are_coming_whether_we_like_it_or_not/), since I'm doing something complementary to you. Maybe you should make your own topic again?  A couple more points: The actual mods given were mostly shitty (see /u/lolzergrush above) and the secrecy surrounding it runs counter to the modding community.   Unfortunately, with how often skyrim can crash, that is pretty much during play. :P   That would be wonderful, but I don't think it's going to happen, unfortunately.    Yep, but we're working with what is possible, not ideal. Still, added.   Unfortunately, I don't think there is any way to enforce that.   That's an understandable concern. Good on you for discussing it calmly, and rationally.  That's why I didn't post about this over the last few days. Now that everyone's emotions have calmed down somewhat, we can get something positive done.  My concerns are the inverse image of yours: if we decide that something along the lines of SkyUI shouldn't be permitted for sale, whatever logic we use to justify that can inevitably be used for just about any other game mechanic. If the community thinks that TES6's combat design is horribly lacking, will it suddenly push to deprive combat modders of their right to sell? Would that be fair to those modders?  Yes, there would need to be some clear definitions of what is allowed and prohibited. But I would rather err on the sign of overly restrictive than loose because otherwise it can get out of hand. If I had my way, I would want to restrict paid mods to ones like falskaar only (large DLC/expansion style mods), but I don't think that is going to happen for a variety of reasons.   1. We're not really talking about voluntary donations here, since I don't think we're going to get that. This is making the best of a bad situation.  2. People hate messages interrupting play. I think a better system would have something like Nexus' endorsements pop ups    Much of your argument hinges on the notion that "finished" and "ideal" are the same things, when they are not.   You're correct, in a sense. The problem is where the line is drawn. For example, if you were not able to use the mouse on the PC UI, would you call it finished? What if you had to use the arrow keys instead of the WASD keys? I contend that vanilla skyrim UI for PC is neither ideal nor finished, both because of the bugs and the lack of functionality.  Even if Bethesda decided to skimp on PC UI again, they can't guarantee that the best, or most-well-known, UI overhaul that the community produces will be a paid mod. Even if they decide, "Oh, we can just let the community handle this," there's no guarantee that they'll profit from that specific decision.  You're correct on the details. But I, and a lot of others, are worried about the snowball effect of allowing those kind of mods to be allowed.      [Link to skyrimmods post.](http://www.reddit.com/r/skyrimmods/comments/343ym0/paid_mods_are_coming_whether_we_like_it_or_not/)  I'm new to the modding community, which means I only started playing Morrowind a year ago and Skyrim over the last six months. But like people have been saying a lot, recent events have inspired me to give back. As I have next to no money and not enough time to learn to mod extensively (even though I played around with it a bit in Morrowind), I was thinking about what's going to happen in the future. I realized two things:  1. Paid mods are coming, no matter how much we protest. The Valve press release was pretty clear about that.  2. Next time around, there won't be a community uproar at nearly the same scale. The Skyrim modding community is the biggest we have, another one won't be established by the time the next game is released. We can't stop the hundreds of thousands from buying the next Bethseda game, even if it is announced with paid mods.   Since we can't stop paid mods arriving, I think the best solution is to preemptively speak as a community to Valve and Bethesda about what we *do* want. Reading around the forums, I've noticed most people don't have a problem with paid mods **in theory**, as long as several key conditions are met. However, the implementation this time around was abysmal and we all realized nothing but slow (or not so slow) decline of mods would come from it.   So I have a radical idea. I think we should compile a list of the many sins that were committed, the problems they would cause, and improvements that would need to occur next time. We can present these to Valve/Bethesda as demands for the community to reluctantly support, or at least not condemn, paid mods. By conditioning our support on several key demands, we can make sure Valve sets up a marketplace that does not set off the disastrous effects we fear. Both parties would benefit: Since we can't stop paid mods, we could turn them into something which will have neutral or maybe even beneficial effects. Bethesda won't get the inevitable PR hit next time around, which is fresh in their minds right now and so holds the most power.  I've started small list below, and I think it would be great for the community to put together a comprehensive list and make it as official as possible. Hopefully this will be an opportunity to bring us together after the recent bitterness.  Here's my start, from what I've seen people saying.   Issues:  1. The way the marketplace was set up encouraged crap shovelware micro transactions over good mods. 2. There is no good way to test a mod and return it if it doesn't work. 3. There is no way to make sure that the modder will continue supporting the mod through main game updates and other mod changes.  4. Mods use one another assets all the time, which makes monetizing them a legal quagmire. In addtion, relying on modders and the community to police stolen assets in unworkable. 5. The paltry 25% the modders got was absolutely ridiculous. 6. The secrecy of the implementation runs counter to how the modding community functions. 7. Most of us using mods don't use the Workshop because of its limited functionality, meaning we can't access the mods posted like SkyUI 5.0.  Solutions:   **Quality**  /u/DiamondMind: A paid mod being on the marketplace means that the developer has endorsed it as unofficial DLC for the game and guarantee it. This legitimizes the cut they take and gives them a stake to supervise which mods have their name attached.   /u/DavidJCobb: All mods must have a seven day return policy, no questions asked and no consequences.  /u/BullZEye22: Mods should gather a certain amount of approval before they can be sold.  /u/fadingsignal: Behind the scenes, there should be a partially dedicated faster-response support team for mod authors. If a mod is having trouble because the Steam downloader is screwing it up, or there is abuse or stolen assets being used, someone who is a verified author should have a slightly elevated support level, so they can in turn better support their customers who purchase their mods.  **User convenience**  /u/DavidJCobb: Load order managers and mod managers are essential to using mods while keeping one's game stable, but Skyrim doesn't natively support these tools, and the average Steam user won't know much about them. This is quite possibly the largest barrier to modding. Bethesda must develop their own analogues to LOOT and MO/NMM, and integrate these directly into the PC versions of FO4 and TES6.

That way, Bethesda and other developers do not need to create their own tool and force us all to use it.   /u/fadingsignal: Fix the Steam Downloader to be actually useful.  **Compensation**  For Paid Mods:  Modders need to get at least 50% of the sale. Valve and the publisher can work out how to split the other 50% on their own. There are more than enough differences between mods and other "industry practices" to allow this.  /u/fadingsignal: Option to set the minimum price to $0   For Unpaid Mods:  /u/NeuroticNyx: A donation button for unpaid mods on the Steam Workshop. No profit form Bethesda can be made from this, as it is not endorsed.  /u/MaryMudpie: A system of Pay-What-You-Want for all mods. (Probably not going to happen.)  /u/EggheadDash: A pop for a donation once the game is closed, with Yes/Remind me Later/No options.  **Compatibility patches**  Modders should be permitted to create compatibility patches between mods even when one of the mods is paid, so long as the compatibility patches don't use any resources from any of the original mods (including the paid one(s)) without their authors' permissions. Users should not be permitted to sell compatibility patches; they should remain free. This should rather neatly solve the community's concerns about the interoperability of paid mods; if a paid mod is good enough, I guarantee you that some industrious user will build a patch to make it work.   **Limitations on sale**  /u/DavidJCobb Mod authors should not be permitted to sell bugfixes for base game content, official DLC, or any other mods. These must be free. Obviously this policy must be worded in such a manner as to permit a mod author to continue selling a mod even if they must later release a bugfix for it; yet to forbid that author from releasing the bugfix itself as a separate paid product.  /u/DiamondMind: UI and other "fixes," not just bugs, should also never be sold.  Perhaps there should also be a lower limit on the content sold so that microtransactions like adding a sword aren't allowed.  **Theft**  If a mod author's resources are stolen and used in a paid mod, that author should be able to report that to Valve and have it acted on promptly. The thief's revenue should be transferred to the original author; or, if the author doesn't have payment details registered with Steam, the full amount should be held in escrow indefinitely, without a time limit, until it can be transferred to the original author.  In particular, we need assurances that Valve will pay attention to content that was originally uploaded to other sites, or at least to the more notable ones, when investigating theft reports. The full details of their policies regarding theft should be made public.  **Transparency**  Speak to us every step of the way, and release a prototype version first that we can check for issues.   This is of course unfinished, and there a lot more problems to address. Comment and I'll add it to the list!    Skyrim's UI was finished. It just wasn't ideal for all platforms.   I disagree and think these two statements contradict each other.   If Bethesda were to deliberately leave part of a game unfinished, they'd necessarily be doing so for all platforms.   I disagree with this as well. Just because a game was finished for consoles does not mean it was finished for PC. Since mods are only on PC, we should not allow them to make money off the mods fixing the "only PC" problems.  It seems pretty obvious that console sales dwarf PC sales; if Bethesda intentionally leaves a mess for modders to clean up, then they're openly and permanently screwing over the vast majority of their customers.  But in this case, they satisfied console users while leaving PC users to make due on their own. This obviously did not hinder game sales, and this shouldn't happen in the future.  Am I right in guessing that you're nervous about the prospect of SkyUI going pay-only?  No, it just got me thinking about it, though I do think those modders made the wrong choice. I don't think Bethesda should be making money off things which should have been done in the first place.   Maybe we need a category of fixes vs. additional content? I don't know.    UI improvements are no more or less valid than improvements to other game systems, and should be permitted for sale.  My problem with this is we don't want to pay for things twice. Where should we draw the line between what will encourage developers to leave part of the game unfinished (and profit twice) and what will be a legitimate improvement?   Edit: Since this might not be clear:  **We're trying to keep the modding community as open and collaborative as possible while preparing for the inevitable paid mod scheme, especially for the next TES or Fallout game. This is not about giving Valve or Bethesda money, but about keeping modding alive for the next generation.**  I'm new to the modding community, which means I only started playing Morrowind a year ago and Skyrim over the last six months.

The full details of their policies regarding theft should be made public.  **Transparency**  Speak to us every step of the way, and release a prototype version first that we can check for issues.  **Issues still to be addressed**  1. What happens if a modder wants to stop working on it and it breaks?   This is of course unfinished, and there a lot more problems to address. Comment and I'll add it to the list!    If your mother is Jewish, it makes the halacha (Jewish legality) of the situation much simpler.    Is there not already tons and tons of free shovelware mods? Hundreds upon hundreds of nude mods, skins, bikinis, oversexualziation mods, completely stolen retextures, etc  Yes, there are lots of bad mods, but you can try them out and then uninstall if you don't like it, without going through a return and customer service. There is no way to do this under a paid model, or  to check if someone is reissuing textures that you made.  Also, it does seem like Valve has a vetting system to make sure that this is done correctly. They clearly did not open this system up to anyone who wanted to sell their mods with their limited offering. That in itself might limit the shovelware.  Have you looked at the page? Half right now are adding a random weapon or armor, and some are asking a ridiculous price.    In regards to the numbers are possibly flexible, but Valve is providing transaction services, advertising, possibly vetting and implementation, and opening discourse with the developers to legitimize an income stream. Why does it matter that it is not an AAA title or a car, it requires someone's time.   That still doesn't make the current split at all legitimate.   In addition, the argument is that by generating a real revenue stream, mods will no longer be limited to small pieces of code but could spur the creation of more large overhaul mods or new innovative ideas that very often die in their infancy.  That's a nice theory, but we can already see what happens in reality. Instead, mods should be offered for pay *only* if it is one of these overhaul mods which can have a stable performance. No early access or microtransaction bullshit. There are better ways to go about it than what Steam is doing right now.  Making it a payment does tie up the legality, but is usually more reliable than donations in terms of making money. Which is why we see people sell their goods instead of relying on donations.  First, if you really want payment for your work, you can make your own game instead of a mod. Second, that's why I recommended the slider or big flashy donate button when you check out. Therefore, it's not mandatory but you can still pay if you want to support the modder.  In regards to your TL;DR, why can't it be about making a product? Mods have made great products, and have become better through monetization such as Counter Strike or Team Fortress which were originally mods. The old paradigm doesn't necessarily need to exist in the new, nor will the modding landscape necessarily look the same.  I am not necessarily objecting to a platform to sell large overhauls of games that are approved by the developer, and kind of unofficial DLC. But they should not claim to be the same as mods are now, nor have both small and large modifications. For a mod marketplace to work, the product needs to be a worthwhile investment and guaranteed, which will never be the case in this conception.    I think you have a few good points, but the bad far outweighs the good.   Let's first consolidate what you think the arguments against this move are and make them stronger, and so refute your counterarguments:   1. They all used to be free  2. More people will want to make crappy mods for easy money  becomes:    1. This will significantly worsen the current "market" by incentivizing crap shovelware over good mods.  It's not that we're "entitled" to modder's work, as there are many modders who vehemently oppose Valve's move. Instead, this creates a worse environment for both modders and users. There are some crap mods now, but since modders are working for the love of the work over financial gain, the mod "market" isn't flooded with them. It is a very legitimate fear that the steam workshop will become like the google play store and microtransactions. No one outside of people trying to make a quick buck want that.   6) People steal and reupload mods for profit  Have you seen Valve's customer service? There is no way to make this work well and efficiently, and no modder wants to check every day and issue DMCA notices to everyone who tries to copy their work. In addition, how are they supposed to check if you have to pay to find out what is in the mod? There could be assets in the code that aren't immediately obvious. Modders aren't a business and shouldn't have to behave like one.    3) A donate button is a better idea   7) Steam gets 75% of the cut   9) Its a cash grab for skyrim and older games   becomes:    2) Valve is claiming this is for the good of the modders, so that they get rewarded for their hard work. The fact that the modder gets only 25% of the cut, and ONLY if the mod sells at least $400 worth, shows that is a lie.  If Steam wanted to have modders rewarded, it would be very simple to create a big fat donate button on the mod page. Maybe a banner, or a humble bundle slider before you download. Anything is better than a forced payment, especially if the person who worked on this is barely getting any profit. This is not a AAA title or a car, it is usually a small piece of code released to make a game better.   If Steam REALLY wanted a form a payment, there are better ways to split it. As Steam isn't really providing a new service to anyone by offering these mods, Steam should get a small cut; the original developer should also get one, as this is originally their product. Most people would be fine with 80% - 10% - 10%, or even anything over 50% for the modder. What we have now is ridiculous, and even worse that it's not even explicitly stated anywhere.  Last point: Making a payment rather than a donation makes the legality of mods incredibly more complicated. Up to now, it has been a community where people share their work and build off of others to make everyone benefit. From now on people will be closely guarding their assets to make sure others trying to profit off their work, and all the paid mods will have to be built from the ground up instead of being a collaborative effort. In addition, many mods use copyrighted materials, which has been fine up until now because everything has been free. It's all a quagmire if the modders, Valve, and the developer are profiting off of the work.    4) Mods arent worth the price being advertised   5) Mods that go out of date will be useless   10) Developers will rely on modders to fix their games   11) Modders will leave mods unfinished  Modding, up until now, has never been a product to sell, but something to give to the community. This change upends the modder-consumer relationship entirely.   1. From /u/Red_Inferno at /r/Games:  I find this to be very dangerous. What happens if the devs create an update and suddenly half your mods stop working and 25% of the mods that are not working also no longer have a dev to fix them? It seems to me like there has to be a guarantee of support from the people who make the mods that does not appear to be there. Then the question becomes should valve have to refund people if their mods are no longer usable? What happens if someone dies who made a great mod and this happens? Will valve fix it? Will the skyrim devs fix it? Will it go opensource?  2. You envision some kind of culpability system for modders who make bad products. But again, modders and businesses. What if they decide to abandon their product because they no longer find modding worthwhile? There goes your 50+ hour save which contained your scripted mod, because those things are difficult to uninstall completely and can screw up your game. What stops someone from saying that they promise they'll complete a mod someday but never follow through while they rake in the cash? It's already bad with early access games and greenlight, so why do we think it will be any different with mods? If you think there is an accountability system that would work, describe one, because right now it looks like there will be zero accountability if something goes wrong, one way or another.  3. Most larger mods require testing by lots of people to make them work correctly without (a lot of) crashing. Nobody will want to pay to test these mods, especially when there is no guarantee that there will eventually be a finished product. Making a mod in a job for one person, but making it work takes the community.   8) Free mods at other places will dry up  Nobody is "entitled" to the mod for free. But this has been a resource that lots of people relied on and contributed to. Why should they stand by as this all dries up? Making mods into DLC means changing the very essence of what modding is.  **TL;DR: Modding has never been about creating a product, but about passion. This move by Valve will pressure modders to work as developers rather than hobbyists, to the detriment of everyone involved.**   An AEPi trip means a birthright trip sponsored by AEPi. It is common for organizations to have their own trips funded by birthright.       The risk vs. reward argument completely disregards the concept of bodily autonomy that most non-mentally-diseased humans of cognitive competence value.  So should children not get any vaccines until the age of consent in order to respect their bodily autonomy?    Is there actually any theology behind this very young age?  Yes. Abraham was commanded to circumcise Issac at 8 days, and so are Jews today.   The haaretz article only mentions de facto discrimination, which is definitely a problem. The first link has only two possible laws which are problematic, and even those have valid uses. We can talk more about them if you want a discussion.    Point out to me where.    If Palestinians are second class citizens in Israel, than I shudder to think what blacks are considered in the US, since they are often treated worse.    But to say that "women are just as bad (in regards sexual assault generally)" is ridiculous.   I think it's more that both men and women act badly when in positions of power, but it happens that men are in those positions more often.    No, it means he refused to accept citizenship when it was offered and is now paying the price.    That was amazing.   Thanks for the chance!        but the rockets have not really been an issue for Israel over a decade now  not true. we haven't had a war with hezbollah in a decade, and that was bad. Even with Iron Dome, people fear that the next war up north will be worse.   It (well, not homosexuality, but homosexual acts) is a sin, but not THE sin of sodom and Gomorrah.     I also work there. It's good for retail, but not much room for advancement.    As someone who just read the comic after watching the movie several years ago, I disagree. The movie modified the themes of anarchy and individual power to be about freedom and group power, but keep most of the symbolism intact. I think the movie also made the ending quite a bit better.    And apparently the natural solution is to change the victim rather than the attacker.    Yes, blaming the victim always leads to the best solutions! I dare you to say this to your Jewish friends' faces and see how they react.    So, as a Jew, I've never been comfortable making the sign of the cross or saying the prayers  If you feel uncomfortable with some of the most basic tenants of Catholicism, why do you want to convert?    Satan, a free willed angel (capable of supernatural actualizations) exists (if Satan can be shown in actualization, then other members of the supernatural Deity hierarchy will be accepted)   This is not part of Jewish theology.   And how does jesus fit into all these statements? Seems to me that "there is none other"  is pretty clear cut.    Hey, why not? 23 year old male in Boston, somewhere in between Conservative and orthodox. Looking for friends as well as dating, so go ahead and message me! :)   Looking through his later comments, he is definitely Israeli. I just think he despaired and doesn't follow the news anymore, or only gets it from news to the left of haaretz.   Has to be Jewish. There just can't be a future with someone who doesn't share the same core values that I do.   Indosians go in, whites go out. You can't explain that with the patriarchy!    Before, and it worked.   War =  dead children = attention = money. Hamas was starved of funds and losing support, so they needed a conflict to get back both.   That's why this kind of "analysis" baffles me. These researchers aren't even in Israel to see the evidence. Unless everyone was hallucinating rockets being blown up, it's working.   They actually use sub-human? Are we laguz now? Did I change into a dragon when I wasn't paying attention?   Simple: That in Deuteronomy 18, there is no prophecy. There is merely a description of what a prophet is. Also, it does say that the prophet will come from among you, i.e. the children of Israel.  The post linked has some vague analysis which is pretty disconnected from the source text. I'm not going to bother going through each point.   That is literally impossible, because no one aside from the state owned the Negev, which made up at least 25% of the Palestinian Mandate. So how the hell did they get 85%?    who at that stage legally owned only 7% of it and remained a minority (33% in 1946) of the population."[1]   How much did the Arabs there own?   Sonnet #90 sure sounds like it's talking about my love life right now. Does that mean Shakespeare predicted my heartbreak?   Yes, I've read it. I've read Tehillim several times over, in fact. I still don't see what an inspirational poem has to do with Jesus.   What is this from?   The government is not based on Judaism any more than England is based on Anglicanism, and probably less. A Jewish state, in this case, means a state for Jews, not a state for Judaism.   You tell me listen. I have the full text, and I don't see it. Quote a line or two.   To answer your question, the main argument the israeli regime has to justify what its doing is the Nazi treatment of the Jews in WW2. They use it both as a fear mongering tactic for their own people, and a shame tactic for anyone who dares question their crimes.  Anti-Israel say this all the time, but the only thing Israelis ever say that comes close is that they need a state so that a similar massacre never happens again. I've never seen anyone cite Nazi treatment for Israeli brutality. Show me one.   Oh, I've read a lot of books, especially on this. Back to the discussion: You said you knew a lot about this conflict, and I did not. Do you or do you not believe that Israel was founded because "the Nazis killed a bunch of" Jews?    If you actually believe Israel was founded because "the Nazis killed a bunch of Jews" and you think that you're educated about all this, I feel sorry for you. Do you think that Assad was actually good to Syrians, too?   Yeah, it's not good. Guns aren't toys. But I would be would be more calm in the face of a rifle in the hands of someone in the professional army rather than the police. But it's not a good situation for the kids, you're right.    I know where people are coming from.  Really?  But they left and came back because....wait for it...the Nazis killed a bunch of them  No, no you don't.   Don't take something out of context and I won't make fun of it. There are much better ways to characterize this video that don't play up sympathy at the expense of the truth.   [1](http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/2z1jun/on_video_israeli_soldiers_raid_homes_question/cpf04gt)  [2](http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/2z1jun/on_video_israeli_soldiers_raid_homes_question/cpf2iih)  [Everything you said here on down.](http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/2z1jun/on_video_israeli_soldiers_raid_homes_question/cpf18is)  [ Look, someone even agrees with me!](http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/2z1jun/on_video_israeli_soldiers_raid_homes_question/cpf1pse)  You really need to understand where people are coming from before attacking them, because you're only making yourself look bad.   You've demonstrated your ignorance about the history of Jews and the region throughout this entire post.   I don't think he was. He had only one hand on it (standard protocol in case someone tries to grab it) and his hand wasn't on the trigger. Maybe he should have pointed down? Yeah, maybe. But it's such a weird thing to get upset over...   interrogating innocent children  Oh no! Sounds horrible! What did they do? Tie them up? Force them to be without food and drink for hours? Made them answer questions about every detail of their lives? Sell out their parents?  ...wait, all that happened was the got out of bed, asked their names, and had their picture taken? I've had worse *interrogations* at the principal's office.   I don't think you picked up on the sarcasm.   The only thing that happened here is that the children got out of bed and were asked their names. OMG, the horror. The U.S. police do worse, regularly.   What is this? Soldiers coming into the house in the middle of the night. SWAT teams in the US do worse regularly.   Oh, it legit. The Israeli soldiers are speaking Hebrew and the Palestinians are speaking Arabic. The IDF does do middle of the night "raids" like this sometimes. But...nothing happens. as you can see from the video, it's more tame than a police raid in the U.S., and definitely better than the no-knock warrants that are constantly in the news.   You're own quote is proving you wrong. Verse 12 says that whoever is murders another person should be executed. Verse 13 says if the killing is unintentional, the killer has a place to flee to [if a relative of the deceased pursues him]. Verses 18-19 speaks of injury but not death. Verses 21-22 again speak of injury, but not death. There isn't even a clause for the person who caused the miscarriage to flee to a refuge city, which means that the miscarriage was not seen as equivalent to killing, intentional or not.   I just don't care enough to debate on NT grounds. Maybe a better sentence would be "You can only argue that Christianity is internally consistent if you ignore the Judaism that preceded it." It doesn't make much of a difference to me.    This Is The Part Where He Doesn't Kill You   That wasn't Aushwitz, it was another death camp. There were a dozen or so.   Yes, before it was agreed that Jesus was part of God.   Why are you giving me a poem? Should we use Shakespeare's sonnets as predictors of events too? Prove to me that Psalms is prophetic, without referring to Jesus, and then we can talk about this one.   Christianity is only internally consistent if you ignore the Judaism that preceded it.    Christianity is the only faith that teaches that God has done all the work required for salvation, all other faiths teach that man must do all the world.  This is what makes Christianity so irrational as a religion. God made us so...nothing?   Aside from Jewish and maybe descendent of David, no he really didn't. Most prophecies given are usually not prophecies at all, or completely misinterpreted.    By this standard, all of the NT is invalidated.   And yet, he walked away instead of talking. Has this put the Palestinians in a better position?   Jews have the right of return to Israel, Palestinians will have a right of return to Palestine. Seems pretty simple.   You're missing the fact that Palestinians in the West Bank in Gaza aren't robots controlled by outside forces, nor are they slaves to their baser natures. In addition, the rise of Hamas is much, much more complicated than that. in short, they were not forced into anything but rebelled against the PLO when Arafat "renounced" violence at the Oslo Accords. Even now, if there were non-violent protests in the West Bank, as well as other demonstrations that show the Palestinian people are ready for peace, the Israeli electorate would vote in a left wing government to negotiate it.   Likud does get stuff done in Israel though. They don't throw shit everywhere and call it a day.    chabad, sometimes   What is your view on the Arab-Israeli conflict as well as anti-Semitism in the Muslim world?    Hey, want to move to Israel? Lots of atheists here!    I was going to say talk to him for a bit and see what he was thinking, but there are way to many red flags here.

As someone playing through the game for the first time right now, thank you for that!   No, I heard of these verses from a friend,   And where did he get them from? As gingerkid said, they are probably out of context or made up. For example, the gittin quote, why do you think this refers to Jesus at all? All it says is "sinners of Israel?"   I am just curious as to how modern jews view these verses  Here's the thing, they're not verses but rather arguments or opinions. The Talmud is a very complicated legal document, not the straight word of God. So the quotes were of some Rabbi, probably quoting his Rabbi. Just because someone in authority 1500-2000 years ago said something does not mean it is a divine decree.     More proof that "messianic Judaism" is simply Christianity in disguise.    Ad-hominem, insulting, and not relevant. What do **you** think Judaism believes about Satan? Since you are dismissing the views of actual Jewish people on this sub, provide some sources please.   This is might be because you have too many choices. Having more choices about what to do can actually be worse for your happiness than having no choice at all. Humans are weird like that.   Yep.    I do not have sources handy at the moment, maybe others here can give them to you. But it is supposed to be the same as described in the Torah about God's presence descending upon the Mishkan once it is built. See Exodus 40:34.   The standard Jewish belief is that God's "presence" (shechina) rested inside the Temple, not that God himself came down. God does not have physical form, and so cannot physically descend.   I think the article is a good analysis, even though the author relies heavily on one or two sources. However, I think they're mistakenly conflating the reform and conservative movements. They are not the same movement, and the critiques levelled toward the reform movement do not apply in the same way to the conservative one. I don't see any other explanation as to why traditional egalitarian Judaism has failed as well as liberal Judaism, except for the Orthodox monopoly and the widely held idea that they are torch bearers of the faith.    Those are a lot of quotes...and none of them have sources! So legit.   The second lord isn't specified at all, we don't know who the author was intending to talk about. Why do you think it is even about the messiah in the first place? Also, the second lord is not referring to a deity. The two lords in the phrase are different words in Hebrew. The first is deific, the second is just an honorific. The nt here, like in most places jesus argues,  is a strawman.    Ask! Go to synagogue! As long as you're respectful, everyone loves talking about themselves.   No, it is used to refer to "a god," an idol. Not the God.   These have all been answered long ago. Angels, Angel (who are also Elohim as are judges), God's Spirit (do you think God has an actual face and back?), bad translation ("My Lord said to my lord, etc. The second lord refers to David himself.)  I'm not going to touch the trinity argument (though it could be wrong) because I don't care enough about it.    That's an adjective, not smichut, I think.   All words have both singular and plural in Hebrew by the way the grammar is structured. There is no such thing in Hebrew like "fish" can be used in both singular and plural contexts. The word sky "shamaim" does have a singular, it just does not refer to the sky. Likewise, the word "elohim" does have a singular, it is just not used to refer to God.   Eh, everybody stereotypes in comparison to their normal. I've heard people from the south say that everyone up north is rude and doesn't know proper manners.  	109

As a stock trader I can tell you one thing: You can't mix stock market opinions with political ideology.

ZH never picked one of the two. So the results were 5 years trying to anticipate the next market crash that didn't happen. And when you are dead wrong for so long, you stop attracting reasonable people, and start pulling perma-bears and nut cases. Not because it's stupid to predict a crash (it's stupid to predict anything in the market), but because they predict using all the wrong reasons and sticking with it too long.  ZH best moments were when he/they put real inside information from the financial world. their downfall was that every inside story was accompanied by bad market crash predictions and ridiculous conclusions.   So my stupid prediction is that when ZH  becomes completely  irrelevant or shuts down - that's when the bull market ends.       Can the dough be frozen and used later?

That's cute, we deliver fucking submarines.         people who say "I want X for every American" refuse to acknowledge that life in general is and will always be better for people with more money  That's true, but I think the X here implies some **minimal level** of education, healthcare, living income, water, infrastructure etc.  So they are not saying they want every American to have the same education, just that they want every American to have at least good education. If some can get more, good for them.    You are right about the separation, but would you vote for someone that says it's immoral to marry black people? Sure, he won't criminalize it, but he thinks it's wrong.    Saying it's a "moral crisis" brings us back decades as far as understanding gay people.   I personally don't think that it's a make or break for a president, but it's a sure one big minus.

Almost all of the market is secondary (between old drivers to new) so prices go up. Taxi drivers are the first to object to issuing more medallions because they don't want more competition.   In many cities there are few large taxi businesses which own all the licenses and they rent them to individual drivers. This way they maximize its usage (the license drives 24/7) and sees its value goes up due to lack of supply, which they fight hard to keep it that way. They are also in position to outbid any new player. Many banks will use the other medallions the business owns as a collateral for a loan for new medallion.  The second reason is interest rates. When interest rates are low, such as today, all yielding products, from bonds to real estates to medallions go up in price to adjust for lower return.

Kiss me, child, he croaked, in a voice as dry and husky as a death rattle.   Does he think to scare me? Arya kissed him where his nose should be and plucked the grave worm from his eye to eat it, but it melted like a shadow in her hand. The yellow skull was melting too, and the kindliest old man that she had ever seen was smiling down at her. No one has ever tried to eat my worm before, he said. Are you hungry, child?

I'm enjoying The Weeknd, XX, Madeon, Seven Lions, Purity Ring.      to make a certain script run at startup, simply create a shortcut to that script in your startup folder       C:\Users\username\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup  This can get you started with listing all ahk files in a folder, using arrows to select a script and Enter to run it:      #SingleInstance,Force          ahkfolder = E:\sciptfolder     loop, %ahkfolder%\*.ahk     {      If (StrLen(allfiles) = 0)       allfiles=%A_LoopFileName%      else       allfiles=%allfiles%|%A_LoopFileName%     }          Gui, Add, ListBox, x6 y30 w220 h340 vListScript , %allfiles%     Gui, Add, Button, Hidden Default, Default     Gui, Show     return          ButtonExit:     ExitApp          GuiClose:     ExitApp           ButtonDefault:     Gui, Submit , NoHide     Run %ahkfolder%\%ListScript%     return            Samson Option is the name of a book about Israel's nuclear.

Okay, now I need 30 minutes in /r/eyebleach.   As someone who worked a lot with dogs, I must say that he got the main idea. However, it's almost impossible to implement in real life, especially if the dog is trained to arrack (like k9). A more reasonable approach would be to give up the hand, there's nothing you can really do to avoid it. Try to minimize the distance, don't hit or kick (they won't feel anything anyway), and if you are close enough try to fall on the do and position yourself behind his head. If you fell on the ground and the dog isn't beneath you (most chances for trained dogs), you lost.   And end his rant with something about weed. He's like 14y/o that gets excited and must talk about those edgy things like atheism and weed without anybody asking or giving a fuck.   Oh thanks. Obviously I'm not going to take this test because I know exactly where I land. (Hint: there are many like them, but this is mine)      Remove /r/pics, add /r/pic. You are welcome.    ITT: 4 letters acronyms that I never heard of. WTH are MBTI, INFP, ENFP, INTJ?   Only to lower 48. Tough luck jazz lovers of Alaska.    Yeah, Putin is already planning a move, he just waits for them to gather some wealth.    And probably SSN.   Classic Some Guy.    I mean I kill 'em every time they do a song with me, momma   I sing a hook they sing along with me ,momma   What more they want from me, momma?   Wow, I thought someone posted the Yardbirds to /r/listentothis! very cool old school sound, I love it.   Hypocrisy will depend on her argument. If she claims the inequality problem/solution is $/hr wage cap, then yes.   But if she claims the solution to inequality is minimum wage, taxes, CEO/employees salary ratio, free education, glass ceiling or dozens of other arguments (right or wrong), then no, hypocrisy got nothing to do with that.    How much memory you got on that stick?   Season 6 ended few days ago, ending the series.   [Curb Your Enthusiasm!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIVYdd60eNs)   Yes. Well, they should. You expect from a waiter in this kind of restaurant to explain the dishes fluently and the way they are made, to match wines and other drinks (even if they have a sommelier), to bring your food exactly when it's ready, to serve just 2-3 tables at a time, etc. Now, if you think that's not worth the tip, then it's fine, you don't have to visit the restaurant. Lots of people don't think a steak for two should cost $225.   Yes.   Sure, who doesn't? I love my piss and I think it pairs well with rosemary garlic bread. It's understandable however, if a post with my piss in tall glass and pickles on the side will be removed from /r/food.    To be fair, OP could have made his point without being a dick.   Neither. Manufacturing something bigger isn't innovative and selling something you can do without isn't a scam. It's called flavor and there's is a place for many of them in any market.    A bit of cliche maybe, but Catcher in the Rye. I read as a teenager (well, didn't we all), and suddenly I wasn't afraid of life anymore. I felt belonged.    Because everybody was looking for EVA!   Yeah, that was nice connection. However, Boyd is wrong, because all 3 of them made it out alive. That's why I liked the idea of the song 'never leave Harlen alive' was played about 3/4 through, when their fate wasn't just clear.    Person of Interest. It's a broadcast series, so 20+ episodes/season, some of the episodes are case of the week type, but there's a long arc. The characters are developed steadily, the story gets more and more complicated, and some of the dialogs and one-liners are great.   Also, I just posted in /r/PersonOfInterest how it's the most represented show in IMDB's top 50 highest rated episodes. 5 episodes made it to that list. It's a good show.   Person of Interest has 5 episodes on [the list](http://www.imdb.com/search/title?num_votes=1000, sort=user_rating,desc title_type=tv_episode) (tied with House MD). 4 of the 5 are top 16.  The episodes are:  Name| Season/Year | Score | IMDB rank | Memory ---|---|---- | --- | --- [If-Then-Else](http://www.reddit.com/r/PersonOfInterest/comments/2rkooy/person_of_interest_4x11_ifthenelse_episode/)| [S04E11/2015](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt4128194/) | 9.9 |2 | *Shaw: Annoyed attempt to deflect subtext* [The Devil's Share](http://www.reddit.com/r/PersonOfInterest/comments/1rjfrz/episode_discussion_s03e10_the_devils_share/)| [S03E10/2013](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3331452/)| 9.8 |9 | *Fusco: If I'd known about the carpooling arrangements, I would have driven separately.* [The Crossing](http://www.reddit.com/r/PersonOfInterest/comments/1r0u4w/episode_discussion_s03e09_the_crossing/) | [S03E09/2013](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3291628/)| 9.7 |13 |*Fusco: Let me guess, Mr. Congeniality's in some kind of trouble.* [Deus Ex Machina](http://www.reddit.com/r/PersonOfInterest/comments/25hu1x/person_of_interest_3x23_deus_ex_machina_episode/) | [S03E23/2014](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3615630/) | 9.7 |16 | *Decima Tech: Where the hell have you been?* *Root: Honestly?

I bet he thinks he should ask them how many partners they had, and only move forward if it's 3 or less. Okay, I made myself sick, time to stop.   I recommend [An Instance of the Fingerpost by Iain Pears](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15888.An_Instance_of_the_Fingerpost). An historical mystery set in 1665 Oxford, England. The story has 4 parts, each told by a different person. Some of the characters are based on real people/personalities.      I wear bracelet for all the bots that cut their wrists.   I once gave some change to a homeless guy and I got arrested because "it's not okay for someone to set up a bank and start giving out loans to the public with no license".   He pulled first on Raylan. If you go frame by frame, he moved his arm first (hard to tell because both are right handed, and the camera shoots from his left). But anyway, it was half a second after he said to Raylan he'd shoot him. So I guess that's... justified?   Out if curiosity I googled season 5 reviews, with 2 weeks time range before the premier. Top results that aren't fan sites: telegraph, frobes, independent, cnet and ew - can't say I'm surprised. Exactly where the current generation hangs out. io9 btw, reported from premier event in SF (probably 1-2 episodes?), which, again, makes much more sense than mass mailing shitty quality DVD.   While *Wonderful Tonight* is about his drug dealer getting OD and Clapton had to take him to the hospital in the middle of his wedding.   What good a review without spoliers would do a week before the show? To build hype, you send actors to late night shows, you show clips, you make trailers. What's the point of sendind a dvd with 4 (!) episodes to the most hyped show anyway?    1. Don't mail a DVD 2. Privately stream couple of hours before the show (like many do anyway today) 3. Review should be online when the show is done.    That's good. Those screeners belong to another era (newspapers and monthly/weekly magazines that needs be, what your father calls, "printed". It's got something to do with paper, so I've heard). Time to move on.       I'm glad they didn't. Because the entire final scene was about how 2 of the 3 DID leave Harlan alive. Well, come to think about it, even Boyd is alive.    Step 1: verify your health insurance covers practice.   Yeah, talking about being in the wrong side of an issue. Maybe legal marijuana is so mainstream that he's trying to be anti establishment.    How much per death?   I really liked the kings back then. They played great and had a good chance. That uncatched rebound that went straight into Horry's hands for 3 pointer on the buzzer... man, I can feel my blood boiling up again.   Man, I'm on the same boat. From time to time I try to force myself to trade the open, so I'll keep busy and not play around, but so far my best trades are EOD, so I'm sticking with that.    I left in '09, just before they opened.    Yes, and there are also many worksheets available on the web. [This one](http://www.investmentmoats.com/StockPortfolioTracker/stockportfolioinvestmenttracker.php) also has online version (Google docs).   Their coach was their superstar.    Another way of putting it is "Shaq had Kobe". God, the 2000-2002 Lakers were a real Force majeure. I'm glad I was there to watch them... even if I hated every moment of it. I suddenly remember all the frustration. Like you had start the 4th with at least 20 points lead or you wouldn't have a chance.    I lived and worked in NJ. Took me 2 years to come to my senses and move to Manhattan. Never looked back. Well, besides country bike rides and going to Costco. So I guess they have that going on for them.   Okay, I'm going to give a different answer here. Where I live, those kind of fences are used to keep motorcycles out of the way of bicycle paths, and you typically see them at the entrance of public parks.   Anyway, whatever this meant for, it's not doing it.   [another one](http://i.imgbox.com/QOotV8fQ.jpeg)        it simply asks what happened to them  So even an answer describing "a day in a life" would count as correct.    I don't see any click bait. I literally didn't believe what happened next. I sent a PM to the mods, and they verified the story. So not only I'm a believer now, I'm also impressed by OP who knew I would react this way. PS I'm also impressed with the little boy who dressed like spiderman under his dress for 3 years.   [More @amandaeliselee](https://instagram.com/amandaeliselee/).

And even fewer than that had anything to do with slavery back then. Almost none of them have anything to do with [slavery today](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/04/Modern_incidence_of_slavery.png) (which I would say is a bigger problem than an issue 150 years ago, but that's none of my business).

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS   I was thinking a lot about getting disk breaks, and I see that as somewhat disadvantage, but is it realistic to get disc breaks for 600? I doubt it.

I mostly hear positive things, so there's a good chance I'll get them. Seems like a good choice in that price range.   Not necessarily the largest and not necessarily bailout, but many do enjoy government's help.   Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying their existence is depended on this help or that it's a big part of their survival. I'm saying that it does exist.  Here are top 10% names (rank below 50) from F500 (not the S P):  * J.P. Morgan (#18) - all banks rely heavily on Fed short term loans. The target interest rate is basically a guaranteed loan to the business which they can take and leverage other loans to retails at higher rate. Most banks on the list have this privilege. Also, specifically on JPM, the fire sales of BS during the 2008 was a government deal (backing up BS bad debt).   Citi (#26) was obviously totally saved.   BoA (#21) received $50B TARP + $100B losses cover during 2009.  * Verizon (#16), AT T (#11) and other networking companies enjoy shielding regulations and limited competition.   * Exxon Mobil (#2), Chevron (#3), Valero (#10) and other oil companies do enjoy some nice specifics [tax breaks](http://cdn.theatlantic.com/static/mt/assets/business/Oil_and_Gas_Breaks.JPG). Shell (#2 on the global F500 list) is also getting $1.5B tax break from Pennsylvania.  * Berkshire Hathaway (#4) - didn't take money directly, but some holdings did (GS (#74), BoA (#21), M T for example). You can probably add rail stimulus money to Burlington Northern.  * GE (#9) got government backup for $139 Billion of its debt. GE is also getting almost half a billion a year from different states.  * Boeing (#30) is getting $200M from South Carolina and another $100M from other states.  * GM (#7), Ford (#8) - $80B government help.  * Fannie Mae (#13) together with Freddie Mac (#32)  - huge bailout (takeover basically).    The French director is Michel Gondry, who directed Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind and also won an Original Screenplay Oscar on that film.   The documentary, *Is the Man Who is Tall Happy?*, is nice, but it's mostly about languages and how they emerge. It's more of a conversation than a documentary, so it gets heavy and repetitive (so does the animation). Worth a shot by all means, but it's not a brilliant film.     Yelling "fire" and free speech aren't related. One isn't an exception of the other.   wait, what? \*slowly stop raping and walk background*   Look, you are right by using 'demanding'. I never said someone wrongs you by not refunding.   However, if I'm in a restaurant, the waiter asks me how's the food even after I'm done, and I say I didn't like it. It's a good and reasonable practice to suggest a replacement, offer desert or even not charge. Lots of restaurants will do that. Also, more importantly, lots of customers will not demand a full refund. I personally found myself in few situations where I didn't expect refund. Most people are reasonable.   My point is: if you as a customer didn't enjoy your game, it's perfectly reasonable to ask for a refund. If you are a game developer, it's also reasonable to offer a refund.  The fact that you 'consumed' the experience got nothing to do with it.   When I told Costco my printer didn't work afrer 3 damn years, they refunded me. And we all know the old printer is 'consumed' and probably going to the trash bin. It's a good and reasonable business policy. And gamers should know that.   Oil will probably won't dry up, it's the demand for oil will dry up.  If they are investing, good for them, but it means they'll be some rich Saudi families. Not a rich Saudi country. There's also a good chance that future generations will destroy this wealth, which is typically the case.    The Fast and the Furious... and the Rude.  	200
 Vrlden kommer inte att hlla om det ska fungera s fr all evighet. Den kommer iallafall inte vara en vrld jag vill leva i om den fortstter i samma riktning.. Men misstrsta inte. Alla generationer har kmpat mot ngot som verkat helt overvinnerligt. Om det s var kvinnlig rstrtt, rtten att lska vilken person man vill oavsett kn, svartas frihet eller frmgenhetsklyftan s har det alltid funnits folk som sttt upp fr det som varit rtt. Ofta mot alla odds. Med mngder av mnniskor som psttt att de aldrig kommer lyckas. Men de som sttt upp fr rttvisan har vunnit till slut. Efter att mnga har kmpat sig snder och samman har vrlden till slut blivit en bttre plats.  Att stta sig ner och tjura r inte rtt instllning. Inte heller att frga hur det ska gras. Problem r till fr att lsas. Och det kan vi inte gra p Reddit. Vi mste tala om detta med mnniskor. Det mste bli ett mne som ligger p folks tunga och vill gra sig hrt.  **Detta r min sikt**   r det inte dags att frska gra ngot t det istllet fr att ge upp?  Jag r s jvla trtt p att g till ett val och rsta p en politiker jag gillar. Fr att sedan upptcka att det inte blir ngon skillnad ver huvud taget. Och om det blir det r den s marginell att den knappt syns om man tar hnsyn till konjunkturfrndringarna.  Frra ret gde de 1% rikaste i vrlden 47% av vrldens tillgngar. Nsta r kommer den siffran ha stigit till 50%. Det borde viftas med flaggor, men alla gr till sitt jobb 7-4 och ltsas som ingenting.   I'm sorry. And of course you didn't. I did not mean it personally. I recognize your username and you have posted some really good ones. But this one wasn't one of them :) I did not mean to offend you.   Grattis. Du r den frsta som frsker starta en diskussion istllet fr att plocka sakfrgor i min text och gnlla p dem.   Nej, det r klart att det inte r ltt. D hade det ju redan realiserats. Och jag vet om svrigheterna. Det r inte en slump att Kamprad satte upp en stiftelse och avskrev sig IKEA juridiskt redan 1982. Han vill behlla sin kosing. Det kan man frst. Till en viss grns.   Det faktum att den hr diskussionen inte finns i Sverige ver huvudtaget, trots att vi kkar gubbens kttbullar varje mnad. Det r absurt.   Om diskussionen fanns skulle man kunna gra ngot. Men den finns inte. Jag har inte hrt media prata om frmgenhetsklyftorna i Sverige och inte minst i andra delar av vrlden dr problemet r s fatalt att jag blir livrdd.. r detta vad mnniskan ska sluta som? En girig gubb/tantjvel som ska stapla sina pengar till mnen och tillbaka?   [volymen av en frmgenhet i dollar](http://www.pagetutor.com/trillion/calculations.html) Vilket gr det lttare att frst hur mycket pengar det handlar om. Och kom ihg att vi snackar tiotals miljarder dollar hr fr de allra rikaste.   Och nu ser jag att du varit redditr i tv minuter innan du skrev detta. Allts....... Jag ger upp.   Allt. Alla. Eldas det upp p ngot stt utan att frst odlas av oss ska det beskattas (bokstavligt talat allts gynna dem som vljer att producera miljvnlig el samtidigt som miljfrstrande framstllning fr betala fr sin ovilja att frndras). Vi uppfann elden fr hundratusentals r sedan. Dags att ndra vanorna **nu** nr vi vet vad som r bra och inte bra.  [Om du tog och slog upp fakta](http://www.ekonomifakta.se/sv/Fakta/Energi/Energibalans-i-Sverige/Energitillforsel/) S skulle du veta att krnkraften inte str fr lika mycket som du tror (eller jag trodde fr den delen).  Det kanske inte kommer leda till srskilt mycket frre jobb att marginellt hja arbetsgivaravgiften. Men faktumet kvarstr fortfarande att regeringen valde att hva in den strsta delen av budgetunderskottet frn anstllande fretag. Istllet fr att ta frn de som har mer pengar n de, deras barn eller deras barnbarn ngonsin kan gra av med om de inte verkligen frsker bli av med dem.  Jag hoppas att det r siffrorna som frvirrar folk. Och att de har svrt att greppa hur mycket pengar en miljard, fr att inte tala om 10 miljarder kronor r att ha i fickan.   Jag brukar inte vara engagerad. Men efter att ftt upp gonen fr hur det ser ut i USA har jag insett att vi lider av samma symptom. Det r bara att vi redan hade gratis sjukvrd och fri utbildning, m.m.m nr det ekonomiska klimatet ndrades. De kan inte bara berva oss det vi r vana vid p en gng. D skulle vi ju kmpa emot.  Jag r fr hjd elskatt! P sdan el som *direkt* inte r bra fr naturen. Kol och Olja har en s galet mycket strre inverkan p naturen **nu** n vad krnkraften har. S varfr inte hja den som r vrst?   Jag r livrdd fr krnkraften. r man inte det r man inte frisk tror jag. Och jag vill inte ha ngra nya reaktorer, men att beskatta den istllet fr andra kllor som r vrre r i min mening helt jvla idiotiskt. Krnkraften r iallafall inte dlig fr oss nu. Kanske nsta vecka. Men kan vi inte se till att vi verlever imorgon frst?   Jag hller delvis med dig. Debatten mste tas upp, och budgetens *strsta* kning r markerad migration. Det r ett problem. Men snlla. Stirra dig inte blind p ["inandningen"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2lcRQfzDXBs) som Robert Gustavsson hade sagt.  Det r ett **marginellt** problem, som anvnds som en ljuspekare fr en huskatt nr matte ska ta rkor och dricka vin.  **Snlla.** (Jag sger ordet och menar det) Kan vi inte ta invandringsfrgan i en annan trd?  Med det sagt ska jag agera hycklare. Och frklara varfr invandringen **egentligen** inte r ngot problem.  Vi skulle ha rd. Vi skulle ha rd med att lra upp ALLA invandrare. De skulle kunna f lra sig svenska och f fullgod sjukvrd.  Vi skulle kunna hja lnerna fr lrarna. Vi vet att vra grundskole och gymnasieutbildningar r p vg ner i rnnstenen. Statistik ljuger inte. Vad sgs om att hja lnerna fr lrare, s att kvalificerade mnniskor knner att de inte kastar sina framtida pengar i sjn fr att utbilda sig till ett av de dlaste yrken som finns och istllet vljer att bli ekonom. (jag lser programmering, hade velat bli lrare)  Vi skulle ha rd med allt detta och lite till om vra nationalhjltar vi alltid hyllar, som startat IKEA, Hennes   Mauritz, Tetra Pak m.m m.m skulle komma ver sitt begr att behlla varenda krona (som de sklart har kmpat jvligt hrt fr. Iallafall de flesta av dem) och komma underfund med att en mnniska och hans eller hennes familj inte behver ha flera miljarder kronor att rra sig med. Man blir inte lyckligare av att ha s mycket pengar. Det r vetenskapligt bevisat (ett uttryck som vattnats ur och frlorat sin slagkraft. Men tnk p vad det betyder).  Vissa av dessa fretag har flera gare, med tskilliga miljarder (20-30) i frmgenhet vardera. Mnga av dem str skrivna i London, p Bahamas och andra platser dr de p ett eller annat vis antingen slipper undan skatt eller behver betala vldigt mycket mindre n hr i Sverige.  Allt fr att ha 12 Miljarder kronor p kontot istllet fr 7 miljarder kronor.  (Kamprad har ver 500 miljarder kronor. Snart 2% av de dr 40 000 miljarderna alla skojar om. Hela jvla tiden)     Du borde ta en titt p de senaste opinionsunderskningarna dr han kat med 20% de senaste tv mnaderna.  Men jag antar att du ser p Fox News. Chansen att han vinner primrvalet r sklart osannolikt. Men det skulle vara det bsta som hnt dem p vldigt lnge politiskt.. Antalet lagliga mutor politikerna i det landet tar emot r bortom all reson.  Jag tycker inte att det rcker. Inte fr de som har mer pengar n de kan gra av med. Jag kan frklara fr dig varfr. Men det mste jag gra efter jobbet fr det har jag inte tid med nu.  Grnsen r vl inte fr mig att bestmma. Men 5 miljarder borde vl rcka gott och vl till en familjs frmgenhet? Hur mycket mer pengar kan man tnkas utver 5 miljarder kronor? Kan f betala 2-5% mer i skatt? Eller det kanske skulle resultera i att ekonomin kollapsar igen.  Nej just det. Det var de som faktiskt gde ofantliga summor pengar som fick ekonomin att krascha. Det glmde jag.   I need someone else to enter this discussion. Troll or hopeless case?   De enda som svarar p en sn hr trd r sdana mnniskor som verkligen inte hller med.   Den nya budgeten - jag vet inte om jag ska skratta eller grta. r detta vrt vlfrdssamhlle vi s ofta skryter om?  De Rdgrna - Socialdemokraterna, Miljpartiet, och vnsterpartiet har presenterat en budget som gr mig rdd. Klarar du att lsa min text med ett ppet sinne beundrar jag dig fr jag brjar bli osker p min politiska stllning sjlv. Men om du eftert inte delar min sikt. Svara att du tycker jag har fel..  I budgeten finns mycket gott. Vi ska f bttre infrastruktur. Jrnvgen behver verkligen renoveras, och det verkar vara p gng. Dessutom tycks snabbtg mellan Oslo och Stockholm bli av. Vi fr fler utbildningsplatser, satsningar p vrden. Slopning av lxhjlpstillskottet som inte verkar ha hjlpt ett dugg och istllet satsning. kat underhllsstd. Allt som ska ske verkar jttebra.  Vart kommer finansieringen ifrn? Har man beskattat de miljardrer vi ftt fler av n ngonsin i Sverige de senaste ren?  De som tillsammans ger 1 120 Miljarder kronor.  Nej. De behver inte betala hgre skatt. Den strsta delen av finansieringen kommer frn arbetsgivaravgiften fr unga. Som nu r tillbaka p samma niv som innan den snktes. De som kommer drabbas hrdast r allts de som har en liten omsttning och vill anstlla. Jobb kommer frsvinna Krnkraften ska beskattas. Det r ocks en punkt. Jag r neutral till krnkraft, men man kan beskatta krnkraft fre kol och olja nr ens koalition har frgen grn i namnet gr mig frbi. Detta kommer drabba alla svenskar. Elpriserna kommer hjas. Och vilka kommer att f lida mest? Vanliga mnniskor sklart.  Jag r inte en politisk mnniska. Men jag r inte helt krd i huvudet. Ska budgeten godtas av alla som rstade rdgrnt? Ska det s kallade arbetarpartiet hja skatten p *arbetare* istllet fr att hja skatten p dem som bokstavligt talat skulle kunna bygga sin egen pengabinge?  I USA har en fr oss i Sverige helt oknd Senator och presidentkandidat ftt ett sdant genomslag nr han talar om frmgenhetsklyftorna att han p allvar hotar Hillary Clinton i opinionsunderskningarna.  Och vi i Sverige mrker inte att vrt ekonomiska klimat lutar mer t USA n vrt eget Sverige nu fr tiden.  Och kom inte med att det blir Alliansen nsta val. De kommer inte gra ngonting bttre de heller.   Jag vill hra folk sikter. Slpp vilket parti ni rstar p och frga er sjlva hur man kan hja avgifter och skatter p sdant som drabbar gemene man *istllet* fr att beskatta, **inte de rika.** Utan de snuskigt rika.   Vad r skillnaden p 60 miljarder kronor och 50 miljarder kronor i en frmgenhet?   Samtidigt r invandringen allt vi pratar om i politiken. r inte detta ett villospr vet jag inte vad som r det.         Yeah. Seems like good system to try to make it easier for politically engaged to try and balance the scales of your broken elections :)  I'm glad I know about it now.   I don't see why you shouldn't just donate directly to the Sanders man. Isn't that "safer" and gives a largest percent to the man you want to have the money?  edit: I read up on the ActBlue. U're goooood. Seems like something I should've known about.    What is your profession and stuff? I could compare with what you would get payed if you were swedish.   Hell. Even illegal immigrants without papers are guaranteed healthcare in Sweden. I think you're good if you work and pay taxes my friend.   I am realizing more and more how awesome my country is.. I rarely visit the doctor.    [Good. He is the one we all need.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpzgXVA8eh0)   You're completely right. It was a really bad outlash, but you have to realize. Although I have probably missed fights. This very, very rarely happens. And the fact that Nicki Pedersen is the one getting a (lame) punch is so not surprising it actually surprised me because why hasn't it happened earlier? About a hundred times.   What's in it for me? I'll get rich in the land of opportunity?   I haven't watched this booring sport since I was 14, but I grew up with Speedway once every two weeks.   I knew, and everyone knew danish rider Nicki Pedersen didn't play a fair game. He does everything to win. He doesn't care if it takes a little bump into someone's front wheel when passing them. (sometimes he actually seem to aim for it) This happens more times because of Pedersen than anyone else in this sport.   And yesterday one of the most respected people in the sport, American Greg Hancock gets enough of the dane's bullshit and loses his cool. Both of these riders are 20 year veterans. Legends that have both won Grand Prix several times.       I came to write that. Easily the best speech I've seen. I shed a tear and I'm not even a little embarrassed to admit it.   I want to adress /u/Vermonty_Python   : This last speech needs to be saved and cut into a new professional video. (that first bit should be cut out or be put last) And you need to inform Bernie that some version of the speech about the 80 billions the Koch brothers are worth. And how much THEY think is enough is repeated by Bernie. Often. He need to get into details more. Facts and details are gonna win him the election.    ""If she's against this, we need her to speak out, right now. Right now," Sanders said. "I don't understand how any candidate, Democrat or Republican, is not speaking out on that issue.""      Now that's a real article.  The one from MotherJones is getting the most votes and it isn't bad either. Short and concise.      Well. You just got another follower, so I hope it's gonna even out.. I won't comment anymore because I think Bernie's stance on negative attacks are spot on and not needed. Also, I imagine the circlejerk (which I participate in) here is even worse than in /r/SandersForPresident. But I will gladly upvote a post if the link is a serious source with a good point, because the fact that america might have another Clinton vs Bush is fucking terrifying. :)   Hey, get a flair :) I'm sad there isn't one for Sweden.    Did this politician basically shush people cheering to get his political policy heard?   I want people to find a video of another politician doing that....  edit: Honestly. Just when I thought I had heard everything this man had to say, thinking he is the politician with most integrity I've ever seen. Bernie surprises me again..  And as a non american I have to say. America's culture of constant cheering at speeches is really weird.    Of course not. But this is a so called "what if situation".  edit: If you're an american you should be very familiar with what ifs. Since you're a socialist in a not so socialist country.  I can say, honestly I voted red in my country. So don't you deflect shit. Answer my question instead of acting like a teenager.   I know it got something to do with beer.   lol. Understood some. Are you basically saying ActBlue is not very good because it gives most of the money to Bernie but keeps a little to pay for their own personal shit? I'm asking because I refuse to cheat.   I just want to add. Thank you for learning a Swedish fellow maybe the best saying I've ever heard. In any language really.   Jag hr dig broder.   I hope you're right. But I think you overestimate how many people actually click on the articles concerning politics..   And if (on the slight (slight) chance) that Sanders would win the primary nomination? Just vote for someone else but him or a republican?   This is awesome. I totally agree. A big win for Bernie. But this article is so biased it shouldn't reach the front page by any means because the journalism of this dude is unprofessional and emotional. And that puts this whole sub in the wrong light. There are other posts on the same subject. Upvote them and downvote this.   I'll be a little surprised if you want. But I'm not....   Hey guys! I'm from what we jokingly call "The Welfare State". And I got news from Sweden that might help in getting a grip of what extended social benefits might mean for the economy and how to formulate the benefits of a stronger social welfare program. I believe there's some ammunition here to counter disclaims on Bernie.  **What the budget raises support for:**  support for single parents  More employees in elderly care  6 500 new spots for higher education  Infrastructure  Local climate investment Support  Scientific Research   Commercial Stimulation     What I link to below is a PDF file (text) from the government  that reviews income inequality in Sweden, the proposed budget's points that adress it and what the expected results from the changes in the budget are (page 24).  http://www.government.se/globalassets/regeringen/dokument/finansdepartementet/tema-statens-budget/varbudget-2015/vap-bilaga-2-fordelningspolitisk-redogorelse.pdf   Use google translate's function where you can translate a PDF to read it in english. It looks awful, but the translation is good. Not perfect but good.  The raises in welfare programs are for now mostly payed for by slightly higher tax on nuclear energy (which provides almost 50% of the energy) But higher tax on fossil fuels and on capital gains are proposed and will enter into force in 2016.   **Swedish guys** If this is interesting for the sub. We could translate this document in 30 minutes each. Probably less.    Also the fact that the budget passed makes me proud to be a Swede. The opposing block forfeited regarding the budget to let the sitting "house" pass the vote.     I'm not an American but a Swede so I'm not really that into your politics. O'Malley sounded good on an info site, but when I look at his voting history he has vetoed a LOT of good legislations that I skimmed. Considering my recent history in this thread that might not mean much. But for example [this one](http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c112:S.296:) That forces drug manufacturer to inform the Secretary (whover that is. But I guess Secretary of Health or something?) when there is about to be a shortage of one of their drugs for MORE manufactoring reasons than discontinuing the said drug.   Did I misread this too, or is that a realllllllllly good legislation O'Malley vetoed? It would give sick people more time to find a substitute drug? But I guess it would hurt companies profits.....  Living in Sweden, enjoying "free" healthcare and education payed for by the country together I think you guys could use some Bernie Sanders. But I heard 'Murica is a free country. Of course you should vote for a politician representing your beliefs. Whoever that may be.    Phu. I think you focused a bit to much on the first line of my sentence, but yeah.. If one person don't get my point for whatever reason that's all the reason I need to rephrase. Sarcasm really do come across really bad in writing...   Nice one. Who do you plan on voting for in 2016? Or haven't you made up your mind yet? Or are you from China?    Yeah I saw it. Fuck.  Yeah. Reek's chapters are a joy to read. So.... How about Stannis huh?.. D D basically spoiled that one too in a "behind the scenes"..   EDIT: **Noticed it**. Oh boy. did I have to eat that one up with a side of shame and some shame on top. I'm not deleting this comment because I'm not that ashamed. Even though I should be.  Oh boy. you didn't read the article, but just read the top comments? The article clearly states that [Clinton's Financial Disclosure] (http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/05/16/us/politics/document-hillary-clintons-financial-disclosure-form.html?_r=0) (You can read the stuff yourself and see.) shows she and her family made 11 million dollars from speeches that are not accounted for in the "Clinton Foundation".  I expected someone who watched Game of Thrones to be a little clever at least. Considering Tyrion is your favourite character (lucky guess?) :)     I love you autowikibot. If you were a real person you would be... Well. You would probably be Bernie Sanders because you really do know what's best for ME. And you do what you say you do. And you do it so damn well. I honestly had no intention of clicking that link :( And I feel really ashamed.    Reading that made me realize there are a lot of people out there who think the same. They just don't know who to vote for.   Hillary actually lied? "I'll be a little shocked if you want. But I'm not."   I'm never leaving. Not even if Russia gets a little to (un)friendly.  On topic: What your're speaking is truetrue. I think this is the stuff Bernie will advocate a lot when he gets more attention. He apparently changed Vermont a lot for the better. (According to himself of course, but I don't think he would win by such a long stretch and for such a long time if he didn't deliver.) Maybe some Vermonteeers should get together and make a video about what Vermontians think about Bernie and why.   I changed my phrasing. Better?   I truly salut you. You and your brothers and sisters may well be the people who save the world if this thing takes hold (exaggerating for effect. [Or am I?](http://www.cnbc.com/id/102759742) It's not just the US...). I'm from Sweden though and I thought America was doomed. I'm not really about to uproot my life anytime soon and move over there. Especially since I already have free healthcare and an education I am enjoying very much.   I feel like I'm part of this by spreading the word here. And in related posts on reddit. Even though it's bloody hard. People are so stuck in their mindsets it's scary.  I'm thinking of getting engaged in the board of my condo. Don't know what it's called in english. But if they don't get enough people engaged it will turn into a rental. And that would just add to the inequality. So at least that's something.....   I'm just quoting those who mindlessly agree on something. If they really do think it is bullshit why not explain why they think that way? If I'm mission your point. Please do elaborate. I would like to understand you. And sorry if my english is bad. It's my second language.    People just downvote what they don't agree on. I'm trying to start a conversation about how the rich are making more and more money while the group of people with less money are getting less and less. Do you not think that is a good discussion to have?  I'm not by any means poor, or come from a poor family. It's just my honest opinion. If people don't agree with my opinion they should write why. Not press the down arrow.   I'll be a little shocked if you want. But I'm not.   "It's literary fame"  longest EDIT in history: We really need to make this a thing. Joe is genuinely surprised. she is trying to make it look like he's just up because New Hampshire is close to Vermont. Sure, it's partially true, But I'm fairly sure New Hampshire is pretty on to the politicians being a what'sitcalled.   It's gonna be the best steal of a quote when Bernie wins this whole thing. (Trust me, I'm slamming the wood with both my fists for those who believe that sort'a thing)  Also. You must pull your hair for making a typ-o in the headline on this one. But I get it. You're as excited as I am.   If yo somehow try to rationalize the increase in inequality. My guess is you watched too much news.   Because most news channels gets a fat paycheck from the ones making the big buck. (yes, duh, and how this was allowed to be spoken on the largest station in the world is basically a miracle)   I'm telling it straight to the ones who are stubborn (usually a good trait, so don't dispair)  **It's never too late to come to your senses.**  edit: Starting with bad phrasing, read more in the discussion. Also, my own bias. Also. Do you downvote this you are just a mindless drone, a bot or a [re-he-he-aaaly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2MPoqqzwdY) stubborn person. Because the proof is literary in front of your eyes.   It really is "funny" because it's true.   [And Oppenheimer would have said it again](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lb13ynu3Iac)  Scary how well it fits this scenario.   That makes to much sense. I think this may be why I slur sometimes as well. Do I think faster than people or do I just not slow down my speech enough? ;)      I'm with you. Either there's right wing douches who downvote everything with a different opinion or there's something shady going on.    Of course they are. Comcast owns NBC. I don't think Comcast favors Bernie in the White House.   As a Swede who didn't know this I must say.. I'm a bit proud...    R you serious?    For people on the spectrum. Sarcasm. That's how politics work in 'murica. Land of the Free, Home of the Brave.    Yeah it's one of those rare cases where it's not about the ratings.  Are there any truly neutral, large media stations in the US? NBC is owned by Comcast if I'm not mistaken.   I mostly agree.  The whole baby drama... And Caputo's journey from a social hero story that were really engaging, but ends up basically saying: "fuck worker unions, go for the top yourself and screw everyone else".. **I don't get it.** Is that the message they want to tell american workers?  I have gotten som hysterical laughs this season though. Probably more than the previous two.   They still use fahrenheit? That's probably what caused the end of the world.   Jeb Bush's not the only presidential candidate who has a lot to explain.   Not at all.. And now even The Pope has acknowledged the dangers of the ongoing climate change.  Many republicans are slower than the church. For christ sake..   "Doesn't mince words. Means what he says"  AND CUT     G med i Paradise Hotel, och k till stureplan och ragga. Funkade fr Sofia.   Tror du kungafamiljen r fattig och lever p bidrag?  De fr ju sklart kompensation nr de representerar Sverige dock. Precis som alla andra "tjnstemn".

If I might take a minute and steer your red herring back to the subject. Hoarding rationed water is basically as bad as hoarding food/fuel/whatever in wartime (very, very illegal)..  But hey. Instead of starting a discussion on this important topic, the top rated comment is a joke on a fucking name?  Reddit has truly sunk to a new low.      Sg en dokumentr p SVT hrom mnaden. "The Super Rich And Us".  Visar tydligt hur teorin "Trickle Down" verkligen bara r rent skitsnack. Och problemet r s sopat under mattan av massmedia av sjlvklara anledningar att de flesta inte frstr hur stort problem detta r. Vrlden ver.   Why don't you take a look at the interview. That dude is crazy.       [you should make one of these](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/94/f0/cb/94f0cb21bd56b93e42b4e712200eced6.jpg)    Imagine an economically strained person not needing to save money for college or pay health insurance. This is the reality for people in countries who enjoy "free" public university and universal healthcare. Their personal wealth would get a huge boost due to this.   You nailed the test. Full score.   Btw. People seem to downvote this post because of the headline thinking I agree with Bill "The Shill"  Clinton.    Damn onions... This will be my go to video when someone asks me if I'm a cat or dog-person. (I love cats, but dogs are something else entirely.)   "Anybody who's still really close to their best friend in grade school is by definition trustworthy"...  EDIT: To clarify I absolutely don't agree with this madman's argument. Has this guy really been president?       That hive mind is frightening. She doesn't say anything about what she wants to do, and yet the cheers are constant..   Spank you very much   He's an atheist? Didn't know that. Any source?    Wait a minute. What the actual fuck are you on about.    The thing about text is that sarcasm doesn't come across all that well. You should try to speak plainly.    No need to apologize. I find that most people on Reddit/The Internet in general get really heated in discussions. Which there is no need for.  In my opinion a competely socialist state is not something to strive for. But socialism has a lot of aspects that are really good for both the economy and for the workers in that economy. And that is something I think USA could benefit from.   What? Me? Don't cry wolf. I'm just expressing my opinions just like everyone else here. Just because I don't agree with you doesn't mean i'm not a real person with my own opinions.. (Trying really hard not to be rude)  EDIT: I just realized maybe you don't know what a shill is.   No need to be passive aggressive. Maybe my point wasn't clear. I mean there should be a healthy amount of competition between production companies so as to encourage innovation and low prices.  The problem with absolute socialism is that it doesn't work. There needs to be some kind of a free market, but it should be more regulated than it is today in America so as to ensure that the workers aren't abused.    And meanwhile the politicans making those decisions. Introducing the bills and legislations have gotten millions in donations from corporation to fund their political campaigns. What do you think was said between the donors and the recievers? "I give you this, if you do that"   It's not about economic growth (which btw is a term used in propaganda).   It's about that 99% of all new money in USA goes to the 1% that is already the richest.  My question is: How much more do the richest need before it is enough?   I'm a Swede, we've been ruled by democratic socialists for the better part of the last 100 years and that is not how we or any other sensible country I know do it. To me your suggestion sounds really dumb. Nothing personal against you.   Take a closer look at the politican in question and you just might change your mind.   That's just genius. Sadly even shoving it in peoples face isn't going to make them change their minds...    YOU! You go to the top. And you stay there. You hear me?  Also. Your name is the definition of appropriate.   Completely agree! Although I think other animals might be really intelligent in other ways than we expect.  On the alien topic. Not a chance in hell we are going to find intelligent alien life. Maybe life on a cellular level. But if there is intelligent life out there it is going to find and contact us long before we would find them.   I see that's your opinion and you are perfectly entitled to it. But I don't agree.   You gotta remember Daniel Vavra, writer and director of Mafia 1, writer and designer of Mafia 2 is not working in Mafia 3.  Doesn't mean Mafia 3 is gonna be a bad game, but it's probably gonna be different from the old ones.     That's deep man.   On a more serious note, not as deep as I thought. But I have never dived 7 meters.    He might be the best monster creator in TV which is hugely important.  But his female characters has roughly as much substance as can fit in a free perfume bottle.      I think that needs to be repeated where people can hear it..   I thought he was gonna make them a [Cocktail](https://youtu.be/XZsiY9S4WpI?t=26)   So it's you. The fun guy at parties.  Although the joke is on you. I would find it hard to swim down to the depths where the pressure is that high since i'm not an experienced diver.  Someone who knows the science may do the calculations.   Hillary need to speak out on this right now. She hasn't said if she's for or against it. It's getting absurd how any candidate, especially the one polling so high can cop out on an issue like this.   I wonder how it will take for humanity to realize it's not the only conscious being on this planet.  We want to find and talk to aliens, but don't realize we got aliens right here. We just need to develop a Rosetta Stone...   How do you know a car is from Poland?  The Polish!   Or elect someone out of the corporate system.  	105

We fucking did that shit on mars dude.  Hopefully without the eventual crushing of windpipes and giant laser spitting walkers... but we fucking did that.      And I bet it looked so fucking cool; when the rover was dropped down from wires.  Like Sylvester Stallone, on Demolition Man, when he dropped onto the roof from the chopper.

I'm sorry... its about getting stuff that is in ubuntu software center to work on ubuntu.... So I just assumed ubuntu is the place to ask since my problem is when I am running ubuntu and not opensuse or any other flavor.     But it does... cause I'm running ubuntu.  And none of the dictionary in the software center work well.      Because no one goes to vote.  The root of that problem is the fact that election day is not a non-working holiday.  It should be.

Yeah... it doesn't trickle down.  It just gets handed off to the financial sector.     You'd have a ton of supporters not vote because of apathy.  Which benefits the republicans.      "Its about Bernie" the Headline says....     No it isn't.  and he's the first person that will say that it isn't.   This is about the bullshit that is the way our country is right now.   Time to change it for the modern world.  People that are behind him are behind his *ideas*...       If you are referring to the inability to mass produce it [that changed this year.](http://www.popularmechanics.com/science/a14651/this-scientist-invented-a-simply-way-to-mass-produce-graphene/)     The only problem with Hydro, is that it still has a tremendous effect on the surrounding environment.     Washington State, for example, is hydro.   Their salmon are disappearing because they cannot return to their spawning areas.   As such the bears are suffering, and on down the smaller scavengers that eat the leftover salmon the bear caught.    Like Bald Eagles, foxes... like that.   No foxes also means rodent populations rise...   So there is a whole network of things that get changed by hydro.     I mean don't get me wrong, I'd prefer hydro over coal... but hydro is the last of the "clean energy" solutions I'd pick.       There are plenty of alternative solutions: like building long air pipelines between regions of different atmospheric pressures.     Tidal power,  Non-rotating blade wind farms...   It just needs to become cheaper than fossil fuels.     Solar and hydro I'd pick last.  Probably even behind Nuclear.  Panel and battery production for solar make it not so clean.      TBH, new designs for nuclear make it the best and safest option we have.   Unfortunately, even if we started now, it'd be 25 years before a newly designed nuclear power plant went online.       Kinda need Afghanistan to be stable enough to access the shitload of lithium they have there.      I was told in a credit repair class that it's more desirable to leave a little bit of balance rather than pay it off entirely.     It shows you're profitable to them.       I used to work nights.  It'd be funny how many people would frown on my finding a bar at 7 am or attempting to buy beer.     They would say "it's not even noon yet"     "Bitch, I work nights... its just past dinner time for me.  Mind your own business, cock."      I'm a Logistical Engineer.   I don't have an engineering degree... but thats the title they gave me.     Sounds fucking cool.   All it means is that i set up logistical systems for others to use.   Like... park your trucks here.  Have your central station radio here.  Drive truck there.  Now come back and park.     All seemingly simple concepts to me, but I tell you it's like rocket science voodoo magic to some.   I just have to remind myself that there's simple shit I don't understand either.  Like grammar... wtf is a comma?     I'm okay.  I have a lot of responsibilities.  And I can get enjoyment from anywhere.  I'll find something to replace riding.     Like eating pizza and playing video games.  That's a good hobby right?   /s   Yeah.  I'm 35 now anyway.  I have a ton more responsibilities.    I am happy nothing serious happened to me up to this point.  Probably because every time I left my driveway I wondered, "Is today the day I die?"     So I never rode like a dick.   I knew I could hit 220 mph on my bike like I see these other dudes do.     I knew wearing shorts, a T-Shirt, and flip flops meant with the low weight I might reach 225 before running out of road.      All those dudes laughed at me and called me a pussy when I rode with all my gear on.  Laughed at my defensive riding.   How I treated each car like I was invisible and they were a retard.    Those guys are the ones I see in the pictures here and read about in the newspaper.     I love to ride.  It's the most amazing thing in the world.     Guess I should get rich, buy a shitload of land, and put my own roads on it.      Doesn't help to have a small fragment lodged in my nerve.   Removing it could mean paralyzing the rest of my hand.... so I just have to deal.     Wanna catch me in a very bad mood?  Add lightning to the mix.    Its like a little electric shock, inside my hand, with each flash.     No doubt atmospheric pressure alters the compression of my tissues, if however slight, and moves that fragment.   My fuck....     And no medicine helps.   Weed can put me to sleep... but I have  to get really fucking high to get any benefit.   So the only time I can use that as a treatment, is when I am not going out in public.     The low THC weed doesn't do shit.      I have neuropathy that accompanies phantom limb pain.   There is a small piece of metal that remains in the remaining portion of my hand.     Low pressure systems are a bitch.   Incredibly painful.     I am living on an island.  I thought my hand condition was getting worse... turns out there is an explanation.   Thanks.      Keeping a couple of employees there 24 hours a day is cheaper than a monitored security system.

Also try to turn off talkback from your applications manager.     Then go into developer menu and reduce your window animation and transition scale settings to .5 or 0.    Install nova launcher (you still get to keep TW multiwindow and Spen feature if you do this)   If you're not on a unlocked device, install a deodex rom w/xposed so you can get rid of the screen off memory leak.   If you're locked.... sorry.  Don't buy any more locked phones that you cannot fix yourself.         Probably because I told people to pay their debt before taking on more.  That's unamerican!      That study is very old.  The 70s was a radically different time than today.  So I'd be interested to see a more up to date study on this.    Sadly, I don't think one has been done.  Our politicians are content to continue keeping this debate one that is based off emotion rather than actual logic or science.   Gotta keep that divisive non-issue available so that republicans and democrats actually have something they differ on.       If you admit you regret having kids you get vilified.  It doesn't matter if you're doing a great job as a parent.... if you regret, you're a monster.      The difference is that the device is locked so you cannot fix the issues on your own.   Also, when the unlocked community has had 3 or 4 updates to radios and firmware while the carrier locked phone is still stuck on a single old update, you have a TON of difference how the hardware performs.    Fucking idiots buying carrier locked models even if it means they don't REALLY own their phone.     Even once the phone is paid and your contract is done you cannot use it anywhere else or change the software how you want.    STOP BUYING CARRIER LOCKED PHONES.  They are MORE expensive in the long run.      I have both the Exynos and the Snapdragon versions.    Snapdragon nets me about 45 min extra battery life in a day.  But it's terrible lag.   Exynos is very very smooth and snappy.  The snapdragon feels so laggy and slow.     But honestly it could be many things.    1. some people need to turn off talkback still.   2. reducing the transition and animated settings to .5 or 0 in developer menu 3. installing xposed to removed the stupid screen off memory leak of 5.0.1. 4. Stop buying carrier locked phones if you cannot do step 3.      XDA forums are really the best place for learning how to do this stuff.    Just don't ask a question that has already been asked.  They will eat you alive for that shit. (never mind their forum search is just an idiot keyword return).    Just throw xda into your search terms whilst using google, for better results.      Then there's the crowd that swears they did a factory reset but really didn't and just want to scream about how samsung sucks.    I admit, samsung should have told everyone to fuck off about getting 5.0.1 and just gone straight to 5.2.   But they didn't... and wasted their time.    Now we are going to get 5.1.1 when we should be getting 5.2 as 5.1.1 only really solves a memory leak that is already solved by non carrier locked devices being able to run xposed on deodex lollipop roms.        People need to quit buying the locked down carrier model phone.   After they've already made back the money from the subsidy (which occurs before you buy the device) they continue to make money off it.    Then, you don't REALLY own it as you can't root it, change the software how you want, or switch to a different carrier.     AND you get locked into a 2 year agreement, unless you're an idiot and paid full price for a carrier locked device.     STOP DOING THAT PEOPLE!    Many vendors offer financing on the unlocked non carrier devices.  Hell even buy now pay later with paypal.    Or just put it on a credit card and pay it off in 4 months like I do.     If you count not being able to move to other carriers with your device, and what you spend being gripped into 2 year contracts; you spend way more for a subsidized carrier phone than you do if you buy the full priced item.   And you STILL DON'T OWN your device.     If you cannot afford the full price phone, or your credit is jacked up so that you cannot get financing, then you shouldn't be buying a premium phone and instead spend that money on paying your debts.     Verizon gets away with this shit because morons keep spending their money locked devices.      Add president to that and you've got an even bigger resume.      Presidents get more huge speaking fees.   I mean... if a lot was enough for anyone in this country, we would not  have the problems we do with all our wealth being so unevenly distributed.    The office of the president is hugely profitable.   WTF are you talking about? you're only counting their salary whilst in office.

We know that Hillary is a stooge and that Bernie has been reliable his entire career.     Just throwing random idiots into office is not the solution to our current problem; which largely stems from the majority of people not voting in every election.    Election day not being a non-working holiday is the root of that problem.        Gasoline?    I'm sure it will be the first among many future out of touch, Romney-esque comments we will see out of Jeb from Florida.      My fuck.  Thank goodness not many seem to have your idea of forced servitude in politics.    We've already seen the travesty of what idiots on a jury are capable of.  And you want to apply that to ~~government~~ elected office.  And make everyone a lame duck as soon as they arrive in office, as well.    Your idea of how we should build a government is the equivalent of throwing a handful of darts at a dartboard whilst blindfolded.        I'm currently doing humanitarian work in Southern Leyte Philippines.    Most of Tacloban STILL looks like a nuclear bomb hit it.

In 20 years, Yolanda strength storms will be a dime a dozen.  20 years ago these were 5 year storms.   Now they are forming every year and in multiples.    I can't imagine what it will be like in 20 years.  Every 1 or 2 months a yolanda comes.    And no matter what month of the year, a typhoon can hit.   Every month is typhoon season in the Philippines.  So there is no reprieve.          Which are like old wives tales, only less cursing.      Netflix should pick up Futurama and hire you.

 Holy. Shit.   ...  Anderson wins the 2nd set as well.   Cheers!   Ain't 'allegedly' just the best word?   I was gonna ask that question but when I scrolled through the replies to I saw that you and the other person who asked this didn't get an answer but were downvoted instead, which is a kind of answer I guess...   That thought has crossed my mind as well.  From what I could see Victoria was very good at her job and she seems a genuinely lovely person.  Yet I'd be lying if I said that there isn't an evil part of my brain that would like to see all the backtracking that would happen if it got out she was let go over, say, sexually harrassing a male co-worker. Imagine *that* drama!   I thought about it for a second but then laughed it off. Darn!   He's 30 already, but, then, he was able to keep up that insane pace for the entire match, so who knows?   Yeah! It was pretty cute how he just rambled on and on at first. He was so excited (as well he should be!)   I gotta say though I can see why OP would make that mistake. Seeing him up close in the BBC post interview he looked about 22 to me.    After that insane start Rafa seemed to get a nice handle on Brown's game in the second set and I turned to my friends and said, shaking my head: "Well, it was fun for a second but now Rafa's figured him out. He'll destroy him in 4 without much sweat."  I humbly retract my statement. Never have I been so glad to be wrong. What a game!   Loved the grin on Federer's face after the play.    But the foundational flaws in Sanders candidacy are pretty easy to spot. Sanders may be polling well in mostly white New Hampshire, but he hasnt been able to figure out how to earn more than 5 percent of the nonwhite vote, according to [national](http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/2015/images/06/01/2016.poll.pdf) [polls](http://www.washingtonpost.com/page/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2015/06/02/National-Politics/Polling/question_15726.xml?uuid=jTWRTAkVEeWVHo4VCQ1krg).  This is distressing and important. Sanders is the ideal candidate for a large chunk of minority voters. His political stance is more supportive of those on the lowest rung of the socioeconomic ladder (where many minorities are represented over-proportionally) than any other candidates. Especially hispanic and black voters, a large percentage of whom work blue-collar jobs (56.1% and 47.1% respectively, versus 36.8% of white workers^^[source](http://www.asanet.org/images/research/docs/pdf/RaceEthnicity_LaborMarket.pdf) ) Sanders should be able to get a large chunk of that vote, but right now his support in those communities is dismal.  This brings me to a problem I see in this subreddit. Here the prevailing reaction to low support from minorities here seems to be one of frustration: Those voters should just be able to see how great Sanders would be for them, right?   Of course, some of them will. With increased visibility, Sanders' numbers will increase in those demographics, but I doubt it will be a drastic change. For a drastic change, there must be drastic measures of outreach campaigning in the minority voter's communities. Because that's how politics work. People would rather vote for a visible/graspable candidate whose politics align imperfectly with their own than an unknown quantity who seems to be saying all the right things.  Let's not forget that this subreddit is a huge echo chamber. It's mostly white, male, 18-25 year olds (well, it's reddit after all...) who have been hearing/reading/talking about Sanders for months now. Outside of this demographic, Bernie's still largely an unknown quantity. Mass rallies and media attention are slowly changing that fact, but without a *herculean targeted effort* of outreach towards minority voters, Bernie will be nothing but another crusty old white man to them when the primaries come.  Why? I think one of the reasons is because those with the lowest socio-economic standing have the most cause to be cynical about politics. They're being courted in the election cycle, but as soon as the people they're voting for are in office, most of the promises give to them are then broken. You can't win a democratic nomination without the poor, but implementing the policies you promised them (e.g. get them through congress) is frustratingly hard. Poor people are being fucked every which way, it's easy to understand the cynicism and apathy towards the electoral process.  What's to do about it? I don't have a quick-fix answer for that. All I can say is that the campaign hasn't yet focussed on the minority vote enough, and it's high time they start. Get Sander's message to black and hispanic neighbourhoods, to whatever group holds sway with minority voters, and do it quickly. Otherwise Hillary's gonna kick his ass up and down the states in the primaries. Because in you cannot win the democratic nomination without the minority vote.  The good news is that Sander's message already appeals to the minority vote. Unlike other candidates, he does not have to to alter his message to cater to their interests, but he has to get it out there!    [Make like a tree and fuck off!](http://i.imgur.com/8ybfdBw.png)  	13

Kyll, nin se menee, jossei ota rokotetta se on verrattavissa tartuntatutien levittmiseen ja ihmisten tappamiseen.

Suomessa suoritetaan liikaa ja mitataan asioita liikaa rahalla. Se on mys yksi asia mink takia tykkn uudesta fitness buumista, se antaa mahdollisuuden olla hyvksytty ilman rahaa.   Valmiuslaki onkin valmiuslaki. Toisaalta se ett yliptns viittaat valmiuslakiin pakkorotuksessa korostaa mielestni sit kuinka rirajoilla mennn.   Itse olen mys opiskelija mutta eip nuo opintopisteet hiriveesti motivoi. Eik kyll se tulevaisuuskaan, tihin psis jo nyt ihan hyvill liksoilla. Ennemminkin on tyhj olo siit ett "mits nyt".

Tss maassa vaaditaan virikehkkej kanoille, mutta ilmeisesti sosiaaliturvan varassa elvien pitisi vain istua neljn seinn sisll ja imeskell pikku hiljaa sit pivn nkkri.  Ero on siin ett ihminen voi kvell pois. Kuka kskee istumaan neljn seinn sisll? Ulos voi menn vaikka kvelemen. Aina voi menn mukaan tekemn erilaisiin jrjestihin. Lisksi on erilaisia kirkon jrjestmi juttuja joista kaikki ei ole edes uskonnollisia.  Tosin eka pitisi saada se paha kierre poikki..   Niin ett rikotaan yksiln oikeuksia enemmistn puolesta?   En ole kyll ihan tysin varma siit voidaanko pakottaa. Ainakin idea pakkorotuksista iskee aika pahasti omaa oikeustajua vastaan. Luulisi ett oikeus pt omasta kehostaan ja mit sinne tungetaan olevan mritelty jopa ihmisoikeuksissa.   Ihmisi voidaan pakottaa vaikka kaasukammioon mutta se onkin sitten eri asia onko se oikein.   Sitten ei auta kuin valistus asian suhteen. Ei ketn voida pakottaa rokotteiden ottamiseen, kyseess on kuitenkin jokaisen oma keho.  EDIT: Kaikille "PAKKOROKOTTAKAA KAIKKI JA PELASTAKAA MUN PETTERI" kukkahatuille tiedoksi niin kannatan rokotuksia ja olen tysin rokotettu ja sissiisti. Tosin vastustan pakkorokottamista koska se on oikeustajuani vastaan. Se ett kielletnk pivkodeissa/kouluissa rokottomattomat on sitten taas eri asia.   "Hey babe, you know we have still working economy in here?"   I will stand with Irish!   Imagine the glory days of housebreakers, everybody holds their money in socks.   Fucking fish oil!   Ei viddu, nyt pit kielt rokotuksista kieltytyminen. On se niin vrin ett darwinismi el ja voi hyvin.  EDIT: Nyt m sen tajusin, jeesustelijat yritt kielt kaiken koska ne yritt taistella evoluutiota vastaan :O   Monen "kermaperseen" elm olisi katkennut ilman yhteist terveydenhoitoa tai koulutusta.   Mit jos ei ole tit? Mit jos on jnyt tyttmksi? Mit jos on kynyt tytapaturma? Mit jos on elkelinen? Mit jos on joku ajoi audilla plle? Mit jos on tehnyt ikns tit ja silti ei ole rahaa tarpeeksi? Kaikki ei ole hyvosaisia.   Se on kuitenkin ilmainen kaikille ja ottaa kaikki vastaan tasapuolisesti. Terveydenhuolto on ihmisoikeus ja oli se kuinka kommunismia tahansa niin se on jotain josta olen valmis maksamaan. En halua el yhteiskunnassa jossa heikommat jtetn kuolemaan, koska todellisuudessa vahvoja ovat vain ne jotka kantavat heikot mukanaan.   Ja se se pit juurinkin olla sit mssily koska se hertt sen mielenkiinnon ja sen jlkeen ne haluaa nhd ne muistoesineet museossa.  Suomalaisista pit korostaa periksi antamattomuutta ja ettei periksi anneta pakkasessa kuin pakkasessa. Hahmo kehityksen pitisi olla sellainen miss tavallisesesta maanviljelijst kehittyy pahan paikan tullen tappokone, mutta kuitenkin menettmttn inhimillisyyttn. Sitten kun ihmiset on saanu mielikuvan erikoisesta pohjoisen kansasta niit ehk kiinnostaa matkustaa suomeen. Ja kun ihmiset on suomessa ja nkevt Simo Hyh tai Lauri Trni nyttelyn he tietvt kenest puhutaan ja haluavat nhd sen.  Tielle pystyy jtyneit venlisi sotilaita tai  sotilas pistmss koivua tankin rattaisiin ja koputtaa tankin luukulla "death is knocking".  Yks mielenkiintonen historiallinen brndys aihe voisi olla hakkapeliitat, koska ne mys kuvastaa sit samaa sisua. Samalla rahoitusta voitaisiin hakea Nokian Renkailta :D   I have been waiting for this moment. I have saved all my money and it is time to make money out of Greek tears. Thank you.   In future this can be something that connects us to computers? Maybe some calculation power from amazon? :P   Itse lhtisin tosin luomaan tt, jostain muualta, jostain jo tunnetusta. Lhtisin tekemn nyttely suomalaisita sankareista ja mainostaisin sit Simo Hyhll. Mukana olisi tietenkin muitakin kuten Lauri Trni ja liuta muita uskomattomampia risitinritareiden tarinoita. Mutta tss pitisi tuoda esille se suomalainen mielentila ja laatu. Suomalaisista pit luoda mielikuva joka myy. Sitten voidaan myyd ideoita hijyist, jotka oli niin kovia ett ne laitto jopa muille suomalaisille hanttiin.  EDIT: Miettik ne julisteet Simo Hyhst "White Death" teksteill.   Meillhn on sit perus jutut valmiina. Nyt niist vaan pit tehd jotain. Isoa vest ja kvijit ei oikeasti kiinnosta kauhavan puukot itsessn vaan niist pit luoda tarinoita ja maailmoja jotka kiehtovat ihmisi. Pohjalaisuus pit brndt, siit pit teh pop-kulttuuria jotta jokainen maailmalla tunnistaa jussipaidan.   Menisivt nyt vittuun sen museonsa kanssa. Suomessa ei tarvita mitn maailmanluokan seurapiiri huorausta. Me tarvitaan hijy museo miss on puukot ja viinat esill. Se on jnn kuinka pit esitt jotain ja hakea hyvksynt jostain muualta kun meill olisi tll aivan loistavaa brndttv historiaa ihan omastakin takaa.   That is not obsidian?   What was the crime? Unauthorized womb access?   Repost and not even cat but I am not even mad.   Do you see nighmares about gene manipulated monster plants?   Oooh, now i get it, watching videos in bed :F   Kannatetaan! En ymmrr tt nykyist politiikkaa, kaikki kielletn mutta mikn muu ei muutu kuin verorahojen mr.   Seuraavaksi pitisi vapauttaa se viinan myynti. Sitten voitaus vapauttaa sen pienpanimoiden tuotannon myynti.   Why didint he just plug that ethernet cable in laptop?   No, I am deadly serious.   Fucking fish oil.

 Where did you find them? I can recall seeing a collection of tickets in the trash near Chicago and Austin a few years ago.   In all fairness, bronchitis can be a rather time consuming illness that a number of people simply don't have time to deal with.   Also, that's just a REAL heads up pass from Johnny Toews, out there, couple-a happy humans out there, Pat.    Jersey and underwear ONLY, then. No excuses!   Same here.

I'm not even sure I'm a Bears fan right now.    I'm not sure Ms. Frizzle got enough permission slips to do this field trip.    I think that Yelp claims that businesses cannot pay to remove negative reviews. I did write a scathing review of Group Fox Properties a few months back, and it disappeared twice. I had to copy and paste it a few times to get it back up on the page.   Judging from the graphic on the back "Eurocar: moving your way" is probably the German version of U-Haul.

Then I went to a public high school were the following apparel/colors were banned:  Baby Blue and Black, Yellow and Black, the color Pink, NY Yankees gear, Georgetown University gear, the number 22, and any random Mexican kids that security wanted to stop in the hallways.   The punishment was going to the Dean's office and changing into these giant Pepsi t-shirts. I'm constantly baffled as to why neither school just made us get uniforms.   It's expensive.   Eager and Burish are still in town playing for the Wolves.    YES! Sullivan needs to be way higher on this list!  [Legendary moment with Sullivan:](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qye101BNhWE)  People seem to forget that he scored two short-handed goals after getting hit with the puck.

That's Denis Potvin commenting!?!? Since when does he advocate calling penalties for mundane shit.   Playing poker with Pirri.   Ha. Listening to the Panthers announcers who are commenting that they "deserve" a powerplay right now.   EDIT: Boyes to the box. Even more hilarious.    How did I forget? Guess the Rodman vs. Claude Lemieux fight clouded my memory.   "Hey, remember that time when I saved that kid's life." -  u/mesum    Yeah, man. Who could forget that night that when Jordan had the flu, and he went out and got five points against the Avs, including the game winning assist on a Tony Amonte goal.    Ha! I loved how she was constantly flirting with Tim McGill, it was uncomfortably hilarious.

THANKS FOR SUCKING THE LIFE OUT OF MY WEEKEND, NIEMI!    This week, as in today? The picture of Barrett punching Pierzynski would make the visit worth my time.    He was right about that last storm.

Your best bet is to message some of the guys in the original thread to see if they would want to restart the group. I'd be up for playing... in March.   There is a place on Montrose near Ashland called 20th century that specializes in this type of repair. If you happen to check it out let me know how it goes. It's a really curious place because I always see a guy that looks like Jerry Springer working into all hours of the night. The last time I walked by he was monkeying around with a VCR at 1am.   I took a picture of cab #666 like 2 years ago, and it was a Nissan Altima. Guess the reaper has fallen on hard times, that car is a downgrade.   Ha I saw that sign that said "2HR 18MIN to JANE BYRNE" on the Edens. That's when it's time to just roll the dice with city streets.    Me too. While on a smaller scale, I was just pissed that this happened right under my nose:  Recently, I ran into the Edgewater Jewel early one morning and had a guy remark to me how cold it was. (He's parked next to me, so I happen to notice that he has the same make and model car; only his looks crappier) I thought it unusual that he needed to walk around my car to get to his, but wasn't suspicious. As I come out of the Jewel, lo and behold, I had a few center caps that just happened to be missing.     Indeed. Ah, yes, ol' chap. Here's to a smashing ice hockey match. Cheers!   I refuse to upvote you until this comment has a plastic lawn-chair.   Yes! I got there slightly before 10, and was able to wait inside. Yes, they do dismiss all 3,000 people through 4 doors on State street; so the front entrance is a little squished. However, it is worth getting there early so you don't freeze your ass off.

 [The Internet's Own Boy: The Story of Aaron Swartz](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3268458/?ref_=nv_sr_1) is a pretty moving documentary about this awesome dude's life and fight for making internet a better place.   great point.   This line is from Stephen King's *Carrie*. Isn't it?   A very good point indeed.   This hurts.   I strongly believe that in some specific instances, such as this one, we confuse *striving* with *suffering.* They both differ strongly if we look deep enough.   The source is [his speech at a commencement ceremony at Princeton University](http://gulfnews.com/leisure/movies/news/christopher-nolan-explains-inception-s-ending-1.1531119#.VXauYqRi5Qc.reddit)   What do you think of such a thing?      The best part about the trailer is that it opens with the closing lines of the book. That is some way to launch a trailer of this film.   That was fuckin kick-ass awesomeness!     like someone never moved by a work of fiction.   Oh how unlucky that would be!   I always read the name of this author twice so as not to mistake it for Franz Kafka.   Thank you so much for pointing out.. Just bought his *The Global Warming Reader: A Century of Writing About Climate Change*    Thanks for the encouragement.    Sounds pretty straight forward. Will do. Thanks.   That's a great advice. Thanks.   I'm an aspiring novelist. But sometimes I just can't overlook the beauty of language that is presented in freeverse poetic pieces. I recently read Mary Oliver's *House of Light* and rejoiced a great deal of wordly beauty that those pages presented. And Tagore's *Gitanjali* is my all time favourite.  I too write some freeverse now and then, and also I was told by a few friendds of mine that I write short poetic stuff better than I write the regular blogs.  And also on Tumblr I sometimes witness beautiful stuff written by random people around the world. A recent one that I found and became a fan of is Jamie Oliveira. Her [cosmicroots](http://cosmicroots.tumblr.com) blog was splendid. Some of her works were simply sour stirring for me.  Experiencing all this beauty of language and words in shortly woven pieces, these days I'm tending to try out freeverse writing myself.   What do you think are some of the ways in which I can improve my freeverse writing?   Undoubtedly, Kindle Paperwhite.      That's good too..    Thanks for the response..   What are the best books on the subjects of Global Warming and Environmental Protection?   Thank you so much...    Recently I found out that I'm developing a concern for the wellness of our planet, its greenery, and above all, for the threat that we're impending upon our home in the form of heat and Global Warming.  What are some of the best books that you've read on this subject?       and credited it to who?   very cool.      Movies and books...    Being God.   From a recent news I came to know that over [1100 people died](http://edition.cnn.com/2015/05/25/asia/india-heatwave-deaths/) in my country (India) due to the summer heat. Most of them poor people.  This made me wonder what would be the case of the future generations in the years to come.   Now, I want to know of all the ways (even the smallest) on how to help the planet.   Just received my copy of *Leaves of Grass.*      Inception and Interstellar vary only by a slight fractional difference in terms of my favouriteness.    he story itself relies on hints and implications that the reader has to pick up by themselves.  TIL that I just suck at it :(    Potassium cyanide gives off a faint but distinctive "bitter almond" smell/taste,  Oh now readers need to know chemistry, huh! Dahl dude.. That's not why I pick up your books - for getting lost on the point in the story that involves chemistry.   What the hell :O Why.. why would Roald Dahl, a person who wrote *Matilda*, would come up with something like that. :'(   The recent one *The Martian* by Andy Weir is a pretty awesome sci-fi book.    I used to be the obnoxious girl who would correct everyone's grammar and spelling. When reading aloud in classes, it made me crazy when people couldn't pronounce words.  That's Hermione right there :)    just practice.  I like that trick..    Yeah, Math when properly understood can be real fun.. I want to see that fun.   I've a point to try it :)   hey thanks for reminding about this.   Math is something we all need in our daily lives. It is only obvious for everyone to be wanting to become good at it. What are the ways that helped you pick up Math in easy and interesting manner?   That's like a Potterhead.. Kudos to both!   I picked up his short stories collection volume 1. Just finished the first story *The Landlady* and it ended abruptly when Weaver was trying to remember somthing about the two names listed in the guest book of the hotel. And why did landlady tried to interrupt him when he was trying to remember how he found those two names familiar??  I'm an aspiring author, so it is important for me to understand what I'm reading in depth.   What was Roald Dahl trying to say in the story?    That was beautiful.   *Paradise Lost* is a free verse?? I didn't know that.. But yeah I agree that it has some of breathtaking lines ever written in English language.   I added *Leaves of Grass (Enriched Classics) Mass Market Paperback  Special Edition, 1 Aug 2006* into my cart. Is that a fine one or should I go for someother?   EDIT: Sorry had to remove the Amazon link. I mentioned the edition.    Leaves of grass deserves a mention since Whitman is considered the father of free verse.  Oh what a beautiful concidence.. I just added *Leaves of Grass* to my amazon cart a while ago :)   *The Alchemist* is a great life changing book in my life.. Everytime someone asks me to suggest them a good book, this is what I tell them about.   Just now I finished Mary Oliver's poetry (free verse) book, *House of Light*. It was a very pleasing read. It has some great touching lines:  *"There are many stories, more beautiful than answers."*  *"She does not work slowly, nor quickly, like a river."*  *"Its not size but surge that tells us when were in touch with something real."*  *"If the world were only pain and logic, who would want it?"*  *"Fear has not yet occurred to them, nor ambition."*  and my most favourite:  *"This is not a poem about a dream, though it could be.*  *This is a poem about the world that is ours, or could be."*   and many many more...  Now, I'm thinking of picking of Shelley's poetry soon. I just broswed a book or two of his and they appeared to be very promising free verses.  What are your favourite free verse poetry books??      Last year, I picked up *Flatland* by Edwin A. Abott. I was thrilled by the mind-bendingly written lifestyle of the 2D geometrical figures. I absolutely loved the genius creativity that was put into that book.  What are some of your favourite books that are an epitome of creative genius in writing?   I always felt that Voldemort was a good collector of stuff.   B.E.A.Utiful!   actaully it's a great relief to hear that.   From her poem [*Little Owl Who Lives in the Orchard*](http://www.poetryconnection.net/poets/Mary_Oliver/17296)   I like gifting books. A friend of mine is quitting his job to start his own entrepreneurial venture. He likes astronomy. Yesterday, I presented him *Cosmos* by Carl Sagan as a parting gift.    I think many of the people recommending them as life-changing are folks who aren't heavy readers or previously thought of reading as dull and are simply surprised and excited to find books that move at a quick pace and include a lot of action and twists.   You just killed me man.    His fight meant nothing. Human life.   I'm more of an optimistic person.. Human life doesn't necessarily mean sadness and dissatisfaction.. Well, human life is better than fishing. That much I can say.   I second you!   1984.   Oh how surrealistic!   I once read a selection of paragraphs by Paulo Coelho. Among them there was a selection from *Lady Chatterley's Lover.* I absolutely loved the description.. it was very feelable. I recently bought the book to read it completely.  What are your favourite books with sexual descriptions? And among them are there any books that deal with *sex* in a spiritual perspective?   Thank you so very much sir :) :)   By the way, can you please tell me the name of that essays collection by Chuck Palahniuk??? I searched but didn't find.   One face with different shades everyday.   Harry Potter. Those 7 books are at the core of my heart and the way my morality in life is shaped. What else is so important for a person than his morale! Albus Dumbledore has taught me to always be humble no matter how powerful you become, and Harry taught me it is good to stay down to earth even if you're the most important person to many. Hagrid had taught me trust. The trio themselves had taught me the value of friendship... And above all, the Harry Potter series by J.K.Rowling has showed me that life can be magical and illuminating if one only remember to turn on the light. I'm indebted forever to Rowling.   I will look into them for sure. In fact, an article by Chuck had once immensely helped me understand the *show, don't tell* rule of writers.. So, I'm sure more material from him would definitely be helpful.   Oh no apologies, pal.. Welcome to Reddit.. It's one of the awesomest places on the internet.. You might wanna check out /r/destructivereaders and many other subs that deal with lots of interesting things... Front Page is awesome place to find some great stuff.. There is a sub for almost everything you can think of.. almost.  Explore and enjoy...

Please teach us some tips here.. no seriously.. helps people like me who suffer to write dialogue..   I'm not native to English so most of my dialogues sound pretentious.. How to deal with that??  (Any suggestions from anybody would be pretty helpful. Thanks.)   Hey pal.. you gotta post this in the text box.. not in the comments section, so that it accompanies your post.    would like advice on what to do with this.  Write another one.   My friend said to find a website that I can post on and create a sort of portfolio on, but I don't know if that is a good idea.  That is.   "All animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others." -George Orwell, Animal Farm      Oh my god.. this is one of the best quotes I've ever read in my entire life..

Sometimes when I observe that I'm putting too much time in computer than into reading I just shut down all of it for a couple of days and just read... It's so satisfying feeling.   Thank you so much for pointing out.. If you fortunately find such links please try taking a minute out and commenting them here in this post if you can. Thanks.   Hey, thanks.. This kind of comments is exactly what I made this post for.    There are theories like the many worlds/multiverse theory where consciousness can sort of "jump" from one timeline to another causing memory discrepancies (or the "Mandela Effect"), but thats really just a fun guess.  I believe in all that shit.. It helps me cope up with this world's reality knowing that somewhere out there is another universe where I am achieving everything that I wanted to. So soothing!   No.. I'm asking to point out the interesting phenomenons that are discussed here in this sub, phenomenons like *the Mandela Effect.* That is all I'm asking.   I've recently seen a post here that talked of Mandela Effect. Till that moment I've never heard of such an effect. When I learned about it, I felt thrilled and amazed at the same time. I'm an aspiring writer and now I want to know about these Glitch-causers. So, I request you all to please post in the comments some of the 'effects' (like Mandela Effect) that are discussed frequently in this sub.  Thank you :)    Something tells me I need to save this post.   Harry Potter series.   Thanks for the idea... :)   Mark Wattney's sense of humour is the best thing about the book.   Wow.. This one is very good.. Fits well with my lines.. Thank you so much :)  I would love to see your work on the other samples in there as well, in case if you try them too. Thanks, again.  **EDIT:** I've shown this artwork to some of my friends and they really liked it very much. And also the more I look at it the more I feel amazed. Thank you so much for the splendid work.   THANK YOU FOR THE RESPONSE.. AND BROTHER, YOUR COMMENT SHOULD'VE BEEN IN CAPS.. BECAUSE THIS IS GODDAMN [/R/ALLCAPSMOTIVATION](http://www.reddit.com/r/allcapsmotivation/)      Just saw the drawing session post... really looking forward for responses.. Thank you so much once again.   I don't do anything. I just sit and listen to the book. I listen to audiobooks mostly when I feel like finishing more books in less time. Becaue I don't read fast.. so audiobooks are really a way for me to 'read more' in less time.. And also, when it comes to Malcolm Gladwell's books, I only listen to his audiobooks.. I like his narrating voice so much that I don't get the similar kick when I read his books by myself.   The light that comes out of screen when everywhere around you is pitchblack might actually harm your eyes and lead to headache. I use Kindle Paperwhite where I can regulate the light emission.. and ofcourse kindles are designed particularly for reading, so they've actually considered all of that eye sight thing.. If you're talking about reading on tablets and mobiles I would suggest to keep the light at the minimum so as not to affect your eyes. That is all.   Outliers by Malcolm Gladwell, and Words from the Myths by Isaac Asimov, and Into The Wild by Jon Krakauer, and Walden by Henry David Thoreau   This is a good idea.. we also need something like /r/artbuddy for writing.. Is there one?   It sounds like a great idea.. thank you so much for the support...  EDIT: Here is the link to the [Freeverse sample pieces.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1u9Y8K-TwazumKmKGdVEVGI3VGE82tpu_hHLvnvVa334/edit?usp=sharing)   Please try drawing this:  *Peacock looked at the Angel dressed in heavenly white, and danced. Its heart was filled of bliss. It wished to be born as an angel in its next life.*  *Angel looked at the bird dancing beside her with its beautiful feathers open, and wondered how it feels to be a peacock.*   yeah.. our generation has only techno stuff.. but the older ones had world wars to cope with.   Yes. This sub is maintaining the collection. [It's an official megathread on the page.](http://www.reddit.com/r/interstellar/comments/31c587/collectors_edition_imax_cell_megathread_post_them/)   None. Because nothing is going to be close to it. Atleast not in a few years to come.   Interstellar posters with that bookshelf are always intriguing.. I love it. Personally as a lover of books I feel it a tribute by Chris Nolan the way he used that bookshelf in the plot.     i also wondered what in the world people were always doing that was driving him nuts; no cell phones, no tv, no computers, no automobiles.  Oh I never thought of that.. And so I could relate to it in the present day life... You raised an interesting point.     *Stranger* by Albert Camus. The most illogical book I've ever read in my life.. I mean, what kind of normal person kills somebody without even knowing why he is doing it??   * The Alchemist by Paulo Coelho * Into The Wild by Jon Krakauer  * Walden by Henry David Thoreau * Angels and Demons by Dan Brown * Gitanjali by Rabindranath Tagore * Outliers by Malcolm Gladwell * Flipside by Adam J. Jackson * Jurassic Park by Michael Crichton * Words From the Myths by Isaac Asimov  and  * HARRY POTTER series by J.K.Rowling    Into The Wild  It's a life defining book for me as well... along with *Walden* by Henry David Thoreau     The Old Man and the Sea.  I thanked god when the book was finished.. Seriously, what a godforsaken boring book it is!   Hey can you please share the names of those three books??   Franz Kafka's *Meta-fucking-Morphosis.* I mean, seriously, what *is* that book???   YEAH. NO DOUBT IT IS. WHEN I READ IT FOR THE FIRST TIME, I COULD THINK OF NOTHING FOR A COUPLE OF DAYS OTHER THAN THEIR NERVE WRENCHING COMMITMENT LEVELS. IT SCARED THE SHIT OUT OF ME WHEN I IMAGINED MYSELF IN THEIR SHOES. THOSE MONKS ARE ONE OF THE BEST ASS-KICKING AVENGERS I'VE EVER HEARD OF IN MY LIFE.    I loved Animal Farm.  Animal Farm is my actual favourite classic.   Yeah.. reading and music sometimes go together like [dick and pussy!](#s)   Yeah seriously.. That 'book inside a book' thing... it was literally the most dragging part of the entire thing.  At the beginning of the novel when the concepts such as *Thought Police* were being narrated, it was really interesting. And 1984 being a famous sci-fi novel (which it is goddamn definitely not), I was expecting something of a Hollywood level plot twist.. and then facepalm :/    Couldn't finish it. It was so dry and flavorless.    I mean, no offense. It's popular for a reason. I just couldn't stand it. I feel like dystopian is just too overplayed now and I've seen it all before.  High five!   It took a while for mymind to register what I was looking at, but when I did.. *Oh Boy! It was spectacularly designed.*    In two days, I read three books!   I'd love to accomplish such a thing.   I cleaned my room, and it looks amazing. Just like my soul.  Dude that's a nailing sentence.   Could this all be a placebo?  No. It's will power, brother.    Maybe I didn't like the book because I tend to dislike dystopian novels...  The ideas in them are good than their execution IMO.   1984 (I know I'm gonna be downvoted for this comment. But truth be told.. I felt glad when the book ended and I could finally put it aside.)   THANK YOU, BROTHER.  	122

 The bible has nothing to do with anything. At all. Ever.  You're an atheist when it comes to everyone else's god and you feel the exact same, I am guessing, about things in other religious books you probably haven't read.  If you don't like the idea of gay marriage, then limit your own life and who you can marry. No one will take that freedom from you - except maybe religious people.               Has that happened with interracial marriages? Or previously married couples? Sounds like more scare mongering.      Let's see how the conservatives handle this one :)  "Oh, he was just some lone wolf with mental issues and took too many prescription medications!" Oh wait. NOPE.  Gonna be "See, he represents all of the group! They are all just alike! It's what we have been saying all along."  Gotta love conservatives.....            Conservatives. She sinned by having a baby out of wedlock which means god will send storms on America. Or something like that.            Damn you, you evil socialist, marxist, commie, kenyan born Obama.  Why aren't you doing what the right swore you would back in 2008/2012 - destroy the stock market, seize all guns, ban all wood burning stoves, put people in fema camps, start a caliphate, make unemployment 200%, etc and so on?  I swear, you keep letting down those poor right wingers. No wonder they don't like you.      Republican plan: "Pray about it. Jeebus will heal you" which is about the only medical plan they endorse.   No, but the conservatives who pimp it surely have. Man...this whole shooting and flag thing has cons coming out of the woodwork to defend the shooter (by seeing him as an 'individual' with mental problems and not as a 'white' or conservative) and the con flag.                              I'm in my 40's, my meat is still good.....   "We didn't start the fire, but the blah blah blah blah blah...."   How is it fascist? Oh right....the conservatives use that word when someone they don't agree with whips their ass in the US. Gay marriage, gays in the military - and them freedom loving patriots go bonkers because some people got freedoms.   Big business can do no wrong in the eyes of the right. This may help amazon's image and profit, so salute them rw'ers - money is the god of the right.      Yeah, I saw lots of righties falling for this one.  Just like the ole 'Obama is gonna ban wood burning stoves/fireplaces' and the old 'Obama banned the don't tread on me symbol the army was using' and so on.  All lies, but the right never checks. They sure are skeptical of climate change issues though. Funny how their mind works.                                             Free Willy!  Oh wait, wrong movie.                                 They are a business and can do what they think is best for their business. I fully expect the right will applaud this decision as it is about money - the one true god of the right.            There are quite a few. My understanding is that civil war statues in the south face north, and those in the north face south.            From this article:  http://en.rocketnews24.com/2015/06/21/weird-cute-fish-wants-to-be-your-friend-and-to-figure-out-what-the-heck-he-is/         Naw, just more responsible gun owners.                        The dog was a mutt, ran up towards the officer when the door opened. Shot missed (obviously) and the family quickly got the dog under control (this according to local news anchor at 10tv).   Go for it, I am sure you know how to post.   I know that about (I listen to 700wlw most the day, they talked about it a lot).  Problem is, the cops are our employees and answer to the people. We can't control what civilians do but those that we pay and empower we can exert control on.  We give cops a lot of power. They answer to us. And as their employer I like to keep up on what they are doing (especially since I am a former cop from the 80's and know just how iffy they can be at times).                                    Some cons on the net are saying yes - but only if they are Christians.  No surprise there.                                                                     More info:  http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/U/US_CONGRESS_TRADE?SITE=AP SECTION=HOME TEMPLATE=DEFAULT   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Congressional officials say the House will attempt as early as Thursday to revive trade legislation sought by President Barack Obama and blocked last week in a revolt by union-backed Democrats.  The officials say the vote would come on a stand-alone measure that would allow Congress to approve or reject future global trade deals, but not change them.  The Obama administration is seeking the authority as it works to wrap up a deal with 11 Pacific Rim nations.  A provision to renew a program of assistance for workers who lose their jobs because of imports would become part of a separate bill.               Same with the rent.                           Is the password "Pencil"?   Ah, so, it's about revenge! "I had to do something I didn't like, so now I wanna make others do the same. Cause Freedumb!"  Yeah, sorry, that logic ain't working as a good reason for anything.   How did we get by all these years with voting with no pic ID?   I can't recall ever having to show ID when I voted and I am 49. You're registered, you see your name on the list, sign your name, vote. What do people think is going to happen next? I am going to drive to another polling place, wait in line again, find someone Else's name and forge it?  We have laws against that already. It has been shown to be a rare issue. But now, suddenly, people are freaking out about it and think that we are all crazy law breaking vote fraud loving citizens.  They have in their mind that voter fraud like this is all over the place because people are talking about it. Create an issue that doesn't exist, talk about it a lot, create solution.   What's it say about photo id's in the constitution? I mean, I usually hear the right say things like that (re: welfare/etc) when they don't like something.  America has become the land of mistrust. We believe everyone might be a terrorist, so not water bottles on planes, security high at every sporting event (where women can't carry their purses, etc), we have a view of each other that we are all gonna commit vote fraud (hey, there is already a law against that, right?).  How long have we even had photo id's in the US and can't people make fake ones like they do now for bars? The solution is in search of a real problem.  It's high time we got back to seeing each other as fellow Americans and not all criminals laying in wait. But the right loves fear (which is why they are pushing to invade Iran now, etc) and always pushing for less freedoms in the name of 'security'.   Lowering taxes on the rich will help the economy.  Iraq has WMD, will only cost 60 billion for a short war.   I'll shrink the government. Reduce the deficit.  And what happened? Stocks lower than when he took office, no wmd's, over a trillion for the war, recession, housing market collapse, banking/etc near disaster.  Need I say more? And all you got is that we didn't go to war and some minor issues not unlike those we had when we started social security - and it is still better than the no plan the cons had.  Obama isn't perfect by any means, but I'll take Obama over anyone the RW has had to offer or bush. That dude was an embarrassment and a failure of epic proportions. And where are we now? Not spending a trillion on the wars, economy has recovered, stock market higher than ever before.  The right just likes to whine.    In Mr. Kerrys case, the senators want to know why he hasnt done more to put pressure on other countries to take back their immigrants when the U.S. wants to deport them. Under that 2001 Supreme Court ruling, known as the Zadvydas case, if other countries wont accept their citizens, the U.S cannot usually detain them for longer than six months. Every year, thousands of immigrants are put back on the streets because of Zadvydas.    Republicans have long pressured the State Department  under both President George W. Bush and now under President Obama  to use diplomatic tools such as denying visas to top officials try to force other countries to take their citizens back.  So....explain how this is the fault of Obama? Congress has to change the rules (and they have tried, but republicans stopped one of their own's bills on just this - and I don't blame them, it was a bad bill by rep King).      Ah, you mean the pledge of allegiance republicans made to some man over the pledge they swore to when elected?  Republicans....they really, really, don't care about the country - but kneeling before some guy they are all for.  I will never, in my lifetime, vote for another republican (which I did from 1984-2000). They have turned they backs on this country and it's people.   Yet conservatives are all for at will employment states and such. I was always told no company would can someone if they were making them money. Has the right changed their minds on that?   Was it Alvin Straight from "The Straight Story?" :)                     They aren't even debating what's in the legislation, just spouting off. I don't think anyone listens to anyone there, they know how they are going to vote and just blather on for show.            Just replace them with siri, would be more intelligent than the cons in congress now.   I love how hillary trolls conservatives :) They watch every little thing she does, write about it, comment on it, post about it.  She owns em. If they had done that with bush we probably wouldn't have had 9/11, wars, recession, stock market down (first time a ever it was lower than when a prez went into office), housing crash, banking implosion, etc.  Instead, conservatives waved their flags, thumped their bibles, and saluted their boss.  But then...no one ever accused them of being smart or consistent.   yeah, it is - but voting to authorize the use of force isn't the same as voting to use force. It was still Bush's call - and he abused his power.  In the end, it's still on him and she can just say she was voting to allow the president to act in the event he needed to.  All in all - bush owns it, no one else.   Man...conservatives can be dumb as rocks.  "Hey, I gets my news from deadbart and worldnut daily cause I am super smart! Git r done!"  I really worry about the future of this country when there are folks who vote for republicans and read 'news' from such sites....but then again, they believe in some god that makes no sense.      For the MODS in case this station changes it's title too:  http://imgur.com/w3Y1m6F      Meh, they changed the title. I will write the station to complain.   And he has a lot more karma than you. Seems yours is in the negative territory. Like, trollishy low.....               Cons have investigated this more than 9/11 (and anthrax). They don't honestly care or want answers.   Remember how they rallied around bush, claimed to attack him was unpatriotic, blame the terrorists, etc?  Yeah...their patriotism is pure BS.   What's a shocker? Do tell :)   ROFL did OP actually read the article?  Here is what was there (from their link): But the numbers of employers that say they intend to make the type of capital investments that eliminate jobs through automation doubled, to 59 percent.  So....before the min wage is even hiked business were, as they often do, planning on capital investments in machinery.  Stupid deadbart is predictable, I can't believe anyone is dumb enough to believe them.                      Indeed. I am not adding any shortcuts for now (except in my toolbar for politics/news)  I am also noticing firefox crashing about once a day now. Not to mention the god awful memory leaks.  The reason I use it over chrome: photobucket plugin and how turns most all headlines in caps to proper case (saves a lot of time). If chrome did that on the fly I would use it more.  If I come across a solution will let you know.                                                                              Udate:  She told the station that race was the main factor as to why she confronted the other woman. Moments before the fight the woman said she heard the other woman in the motorized scooter shouting racial comments to an African-American worker.  Amber told WZPL that she confronted the woman about her use of the derogatory language. The woman on the scooter sprung out of her set and began shoving the other woman.  http://wivb.com/2015/06/09/two-women-banned-from-walmart-following-racially-fueled-fight/           	200
       Sweden's efforts address a problem that all countries face. At least they are doing something head on to combat the issue of waste streams. Raising awareness about the fate of trash bring attention to the ultimate solution: not recycling, not burning trash for fuel, but rather reducing the amount of trash we produce in the first place.          Another troubling impact of climate change on wildlife.            The $2.40 figure comes from an economic study published in the journal of Energy and Buildngs (linked here: http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378778813007652) This dollar value was calculated by performing a 50-year life-cycle cost analysis of white roofs versus black roofs. Regardless of cost savings, this article points out that those who are concerned about climate change "should choose white roofs, which are three times more effective than green roofs at cooling the globe."   This is an interesting bit of science! It certainly highlights the importance of the field of ecotoxicology and should strengthen concerns over the fate of organic pollutants in the environment.   Ocean reserves are extremely important for protecting endangered species and allowing fish populations to recover from over-fishing. This is important work and the vitality of marine ecosystems should not be overlooked.       Many ecologists use birds as an indicator species for overall ecosystem health.  If our birds are in trouble, ecosystems likely are as well, and ecosystem approaches (like the wetland restoration programs the article mentions) may lead to more success stories down the road.   Historically tropical diseases like Dengue moving to higher latitudes should raise concerns about other epidemiological shifts climate change may bring.   Not good news.  As Jarraud went on to say in his statement, "the laws of physics are non-negotiable."   The example of solar panels over canals in India is an interesting innovationmaybe sunny, drought-prone regions can learn from it.     	18
 Try lessons before ditching the clubs.  Lessons are cheaper that shelling out for new irons.    Where is that?    Similar but different...  There was a guy who was a hole behind us, but he was hitting out of our fairway, buy the green, only 150 yards away.  He was just standing there waiting for his fairway to clear or something, but he was holding us up, which was holding the guys behind us up, which was holding up his fairway...  5 minutes of us standing there yelling atamd signaling the guy, I finally hit into him (over and onto the green), and as we drive up he starts taking shit.  Closest I've ever come to kicking the shit out of someone on the course.   When we pulled up he was like "what the fuck dude?!".  I was actually  polite at first and told him that he was in a group behind us and in our fairway, and to keep the pace of play, should of let us hit first.  His reply was "Fuck you", which is when I lost my cool and said "fuck me?! No, FUCK YOU!  Say one word and you'll catch an ass wooping, and I'll catch a case!"   Which is when he picked up his ball and walked away muttering something.   So,  I know what it's like to lose my cool.  But when ever people hit into me, i just pick up their ball, show it to them, and throw it into the woods, water, or off into the rough.    Don't you wish. I own a 3 bedroom house in the burbs, have a very nice investment account, and am part owner of a successful company.  But tell yourself what ever you need to, to sleep well at night.     I think it's pretty great.   That's what makes America so great.  We're everything you want to be, and complete assholes about it.  Don't like it?  Then don't move here.  Doesn't bother me any.    I feel very safe, because I have police and the best military in the world, that put their lives on the line to keep me safe. And if that means killing any idiot that pulls a BB gun on two cops, then that's just fine with me.    And I'm saying, fuck everywhere else. This is America.  Pull a gun on anyone, cop or civilian, and that person has 100% right to out draw you and mow you down where you stand.  You become a threat, you get neutralized. Period.  Don't like it, then don't start shit, won't be shit.    I don't give a shit what other counties do. Here in America, police lives matter.  They put their lives on the line and have full right to put anyone down that threatens their lives.    Pace of play is set by group in front of you.  Failure to listen to a marshal can get you removed from the course.    These kinds of people are what give other enthusiasts a bad name.    They said in the video how bad the breaks were, yet they decided to speed through the neighborhood.  Down vote me all you want, but these kids give other enthusiasts a bad name.     Am I the only one that thinks these kids are dumb asses?  Why are they sinking money into that POS? And why are they driving it around when they know it has some major issues?   If you want to tinker and tune, that's great, but don't take an unsafe, unregistered, uninsured, POS out on public roads.   I'd kill him.    I'd golf and work out.  Then I'd be the Cinderella story, of the guy who wasn't even an amateur golfer to come out of no where and qualify for the US Open, then go on to win every tournament and major, shattering every standing record.   I'm a 15 handicap, but with 100 years of practice, I'm confident that I'd be the best in the world.    Sucess at begging?  Sure.  Success at running a company? No.  My company does 500,000 a month, all without KS and real customers.    I just threw up.    What type of company can't establish customers outside of KS? An unsuccessful one!    And that product can't be more than $2 in material.   Shouldn't they have put some money away from their last product launch for R D?  What type of company needs to raise funds every time they launch a new product? An unsuccessful one, that's what.    Why would a established company need kickstarter?     That kid is so dumb.  It's good to have dreams, but you have to be realistic.  Start with opening a small speed shop, and modify and tune cars.    Try building one car before you think you can start a whole company.  Do you have any idea how to even set up the PCM to run a fuel injection system?  How to tune it to get the best mpg and performance?  What about engine design? Do you even know the basics of engine math?   Ford spends millions if not billions in R D.   Needs to be AWD, 600 hp, and get 50 mpg.   I agree. Wooden spoons taste like wood, not the ice cream.    Is Duvall still playing? I haven't heard about him in years.    Yes, you are reverse pivoting.  Think about pushing your hip to the left and you turn your left shoulder over your right knee. Once at the top, fire your right knee and hip, stand up, and drop your right shoulder.    What did I just read?    Yeah, not hurting the grass. If anything he's hurting himself, when that butt picks up all the fertilizer.    Nice! I love my ST.   Sounds like a first time manager who has let his limited power go to his head.    I have no idea.  lol   I've worked my game backwards, from green to tee.  Been playing 8 years now.  I started with pitching, chipping, and flop shots, but couldn't hit a long iron or driver to save my life.  I mostly focused on keeping my short game good and I shot in the upper 110's then slowly into the 90's. This winter I took some golftec lessons and focused on my irons, and in now shooting in the mid 80's to low 90's.  I want to jump into another set of lessons with my driver, but I don't want to push it too soon. But you're right, until I can find the fairway (or stay out of trouble) from the tee, I'll never be close to going as low as I want.    I got a golf outing with the family at the end of July in Grand Rapids. lol   I've read all the books and my brother is half way through the second and he keeps asking me questions.  I'm like, "Dude, do you really want me to answer that?".  lol   Sherman's March. I believe that's the name of a good book I've read.    In the books, she's not that far north, and Stanis was involved in a seige, with his whole army, and wife and child safe on the wall at another castle.  This story line has gone off the rails a bit.    It's not finished if he is still alive...  Broken and defeated men have still gone on to do great things.    I play on greens that don't look half that good and carry a 1.9 putting average.    After a year of playing I was still shooting in the 110-120's range.  After 7 years in now shooting in the low 90's - low 80's, depending on the course and how far my head is up my ass.  Lessons and time.    I worked at Firestone, the service writer recommends based on milage, I recommend based on what I see in the 13 point inspection.  I would check good, fair, bad.  I'd then show the customer the issue. I didn't hard sell anything.    It's ok.  A bit over priced.  My driving range is only 4 blocks from me, and they serve beer and have covered and heated bays.  But if you got a group of friends that aren't that good and want to golf, it's better to go to Top Golf, than a course.    Yes, but outdoors, but also covered.   To all the people saying the caddie doesn't matter...  How many tournaments and majors has Tiger won since he broke with his long time caddie?  Do you think Phil would give up his for anyone?    Driving range with targets and id chipped balls.  You play games, hit to specific targets, get points, and it tracks it all automatically.  Plus a full bar and bar food.    I wish this was higher. And I wish the National media/golf media would pick this up!     He sounds bi polar.    Well, I shot an 82 on Monday, and three 88's this season.  Shot in the 90's last season.  So I'm not great, not even good, but I'm improving.  Which is more than you're doing in life...   God, I wish.  At the very least I want to see that battle.    I agree.  You should fuck off.    No offense, but that's your problem.  Golf is NOT like riding a bike.  If you don't want to take lessons, at least buy a book and spend time at the range.    I knew about The Mountain, and totally forgot about the Isle.  Thanks!    Holy crap!  I remember these from my childhood!  	53
 Hopefully this is the right place. With the announcement of fallout 4, I realized I want to be able to play newly released games again. My last actual console was the Xbox 360, and I've been squeezing by with a decent laptop for games for the last 3 or 4 years. I can run games like l4d2, but not games like dead rising 3.  To play games like fallout 4 and dead rising 3,  would it be cheaper to build a gaming PC or get a used Xbox one? What price ranges should I expect?   Get a used Xbox one?         	1
 TL:DR Guy thinks he is the boss because he has awesome gear. I am actually the boss because I give no fucks. I win dayz!  I was dying from this. I have yet to kill another survivor, and I don't plan on it. However, if a big-headed bandit comes rolling in, I'll do Chernarus a favor. I enjoyed your story, write more if you have any more good ones!  I have an M4A3 CCO, 21 mags, and a Ghillie Suit. I'm stocking up mags for my friends. This game sucks for 85% of the time, running back and forth, but for the other 15% it definitely delivers!   Temperature isn't active as far as I know, but if you swim long enough you can catch a cold apparently. You have to take antibiotics to counteract that, which are apparently quite rare.  If it makes you feel any better, I left my vehicle hidden among some trees the other day, and ran up the hill a ways to log out for the night. When I logged back in, I spawned standing in the vehicle, with a broken leg, and when I tried to move backwards I instantly died. The game has it's bugs, but I think we can still enjoy it! Just learn what the bugs are, and try to steer clear of them, like driving an ATV over a bridge. That is also apparently instant death haha   First of all, the pain indicator is when your character goes into shock. That wears off after 5 minutes and doesn't go away until then. Shakiness is pain which can happen from a lot of things, like a broken leg or just being hit by a zombie. Take painkillers to shop the shakes. You can be bleeding without needing painkillers, and you can be in pain without bleeding. Just make sure you're not bleeding first, then take care of everything else.  Second, vehicles are very buggy. Your tractors seem to be the worst I've heard. Buses and cars can run over fences without really taking any damage. General rule of thumb for me, if you can't fit through a town without hitting something, go around it through the grass. Good luck bru_tech   Listen, I understand where you're coming from, trust me, I do, but I've helped many people escape from abusive relationships, and I promise you that I'm aware of when they're occurring. I'm not blinded by love or anything. I completely believe that depression is the main difference here, and it completely derails any correlations. I can't explain it any better than this, I wish I could.   If she wasn't suffering from depression, I would agree, but I know she isn't trying to hurt me. And I'm not hurt because of it. I appreciate your concern though   I understand what you're saying, but I can tell it doesn't hurt her, it just confuses her. She seems to come around every so often and be a little more accepting but it takes time. If at any point I see that it truly hurts her, I will stop. That's the last thing I want   Thanks for the reply. She replies with "why?" every time I tell her. Though it's painful that she won't say it back (I swear she was going to, she basically said she loved me in different words [I love everything about you, etc.]) it's something that she needs to hear, and it's the truth. I feel it, and if it takes the rest of my life to show her she is loved, it'll be a life well spent to me. I think OP, though it may be hard, needs to look at the other side and see that if someone is in love with you, truly nothing can get in the way of that.   I'm the one saying "I love you," and i don't plan on stopping. Call me foolish... That's what love is I guess   From what I've read, seen, and experienced, it does. A friend of mine has recently been hit with depression and I've been doing a lot of research reading books and talking to professionals about it so I can learn how to help her. They all claim that it is something that can be treated.  Also, for a personal experience, both my father and sister have bipolar disorder/manic depression, which though they are not exactly the same as depression, they are similar, and both are better with medication. I know relying on medication isn't always something people are interested in, but I'm willing to bet it's better than the alternative.  Stay as positive as you can and seek professional help, they're professionals for a reason! One of my favorite proverbs: "However long the night, dawn will break."  PS - Does your username refer to the book with the bear who lost his hat? That is an awesome book!   Sounds more like you just have a poor sense of humor, which is quite the tragedy. If I'm easily amused that's fine, I'd rather that than the opposite.   Rest in peace in peace? Did I miss a joke?   Why is everyone complaining that this isn't his house? And why is everyone saying this joke isn't funny? Jesus people. Obviously it's not his house, any halfwit could see that he is making a joke. And if you don't like the joke go elsewhere. I laughed pretty hard at this, as did the hundreds of others who upvoted it.  Let me break it down to you why it is funny. Any typical week on Reddit (maybe any day), there is a time where there are posted about three or four successful posts that follow the same paradigm. Then, like clockwork, someone posts a joke that fits the paradigm but doesn't fit the same use of the previous posts. This guy did it flawlessly, but because he is not Trapped in Reddit or Shitty Watercolor (no offense to you guys), you guys grab your pitchforks. Calm the fuck down and just laugh and move on. Normally I would too but jesus reddit, this is just annoying by now.      Yeah, he just kind of shrugged it off like he was enjoying. Which he probably was, since that seems to be the only reason they do it.    That's the thing, I didn't even have bad ~~time~~ aim. Neither of us did. I blasted him in the face, then at his feet on my second mag while my buddy fired away at his chest. Glad to know it's not that hard to kill someone ;)  Edit: Should say bad aim, not sure what happened there.   You people need to stop using the term "you people." It's very unfriendly...  Hacker is just a blanket term *most* people use to describe someone cheating in any way. That's at least how I used it. Scripts count as cheating.  And I live in central US, friend lives on the west coast, and another friend lives in Japan. Finding servers we can all play on has proven to be very, very difficult.  Thanks for the advice though! I too am down with cats.    Admittedly, it was pretty funny hearing him stand outside the door and talk to us over proxy chat, but it wasn't so funny when he came inside. We did call out friendly over the proximity chat when he first started firing, but I guess he didn't hear it!   His voice was way too creepy to be Superman. And he wasn't tall enough.   Oh I bet! I'm going to try and get into TS more. I would love to get in a game mode like this, but I can imagine the hell that would break loose when one team would move in to capture the point..   While in a populated (16 or so) room, one of my buddies got shot from the tree lines, while my other friend and I were looting a small room. We closed the doors and sat and waited, planning our escape. We do not usually kill. My buddy is a hero and I'm making my way up there.   We didn't want to engage, we just wanted to flee. Before we open the back door to leave, we hear, "Hello? Is anyone in there?" in an eerie voice. Buddy takes a knee watching the back door with a Mk.48 and I prone watching the front with an AK-74. As soon as I see him open the door I unloaded my entire mag into his head, which was perfectly lined up with my crosshairs. He runs into the room, I reload while my friend fires the Mk.48 into his chest. As he is running back out I unload on him as he says, "Okay, I'll close your door, sorry."  Friend calls out, "Hacker, back out!" So we both Alt+F4. I know you guys don't like that, but we're not losing our survivors to a hacker. Is it most likely that this guy was a hacker since he would not die with that much lead in him? I don't really know how to identify them.   Haven't played it often, but the few times I played it was more of a match where the tanks drove around the field circling and constantly flanking, didn't look anything like the post. But like I said, haven't played it much yet!   Thanks Greeny, I'll give that a shot. Do carts stop against pressure plates? I could probably place the pressure plate where the wooden block is if it works that way.   http://i.imgur.com/RO6Ws.jpeg  Directions: Set a cart on the track, get in the cart, hit the switch on the top block activating powered rail, get accelerated towards a downhill slope. Is there an even simpler, less obstructive way to do this? I know it's only two blocks but it is still in the way.    Made me think of [this.](http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-1049)  Which is creepy since I just read it about 15 hours ago.   I get one shot by the huge cannon with Squad Flak on. It definitely helps against the regular stuff, but barely. Longer respawn would be nice.    I could see it working on PC, but it's outrageous on PS3. And it will never work on rush.   I've only seen the A-10/Frogfoot in the games so far (I'm not a jet pilot). They do okay against it. If this helps, I've used the gunner's cannon on the helicopter, it did around 27% damage after firing probably 3 or 4 full volleys against it, not missing. It takes about 6-7 stingers to take it out.  The gunship's ability to kill everything with one hit with almost perfect accuracy is what makes it so aggravating. If the pilot is on top of things (which isn't hard to be), the pilot can kill anyone at the plants, and anyone spawning trying to take it out.   I'm not one to complain about Battlefield often, but the AC130 is a serious problem. Don't comment if your not going to be constructive.   "YOUR A STUPID FAGGOT NOOB."    or "LEARN 2 PLAY" comments are unnecessary.  The gunship is way too powerful. The splash damage is too high. It kills people inside buildings without completely obliterating the buildings. It respawns practically immediately after it is shot down. It requires at least two Stinger carriers to effectively bring it down before it annihilates your whole team, with the explosives perk. Then you need a support gunner to fill you up as soon as you're out. That takes three men out of the battle. And it can kill you when you spawn in deployment.  It needs to be either A) Nerfed to hell, B) Completely removed from the game, or C) only allowed on certain maps/game modes with a much lower spawn frequency.  Downvote me if you have to, but I want opinions.  	28

 Cheers!   Go ahead! I was forced into it but i like how they turned out, the person taking the photo's got some awesome shots of him.   edit- i was forced into doing the topless shots, not the photo's in general haha   Thanks!       I know this will get burried but fuck it  I wad standing in the waiting room outside of the operating room while my partner was being preped for her C section.  It was abit suddern, the baby was breached, waters had broken so she was rushed into surgery   I was given scrubs to change into so i could go in and be with my partner, but the 10 minutes i was waiting in this hospital ward with absolutly no one around ( it was 5am) was the most scared i had ever been. I had shit going through my head at a million miles an hour.   But once they pulled him out and i heard that tiny little cry and saw him look at me everything just washed away. No more fear, no more worries. It was just him.    I need this in my life.       I work around the corner!   You are either brilliant, or crazy.   I have not decided     It's different... I like it   Buy an ohm reader before  you hurt yourself.   Please just remove the battery and don't touch anything untill you do. Expecially  with mechanical mods as you have no way of knowing  whats happening.   Edit: Then look up battery safety, no good knowing your resistance  if your battery can't  handle it. Maybe should  have started with that    Two friends and I have converted another friend of ours. He picked himself out an istick20w and a lemo. I showed him how to build and how to build for his mod and he is pretty happy with it.   Whatever keeps him off the smokes is all that matters really :)   If i win id reaaalllly like the atlantis sub-ohm pair.

 ow ow   I personally find Lovecraftian horrors to be the scariest. Unknown terrors and the general idea of human insignificance.  Here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lovecraftian_horror  I find slasher/jump-scare movies boring.   Any reality TV.   Glenn Close in *101 Dalmatians*  zing   I regurgitated my Chinese food a little.   Not sure the OP meant a challenge to *legality*  I see it as in a bump in the road simply hindering same-sex couples from getting married.   What part of "separation of church and state" do these people not understand?  Anyway - fine. Let select individuals deny same-sex couples their legal right and see how much support they lose.   So I've had mild aquaphobia as long as I can remember. Can't deal with water being on my face, especially my eyes and nose, it makes me really anxious and I suddenly have trouble breathing. It's strange. I have anxieties about swimming and have to really force myself to go in. I'm 30 now, and apparently my grandmother accidentally dropped me in a tub when I was a baby (2-3?). I found out from my mom when I was like 25.  	8
 I can't get over the cutesy style of these, the [Sniper and Scout] (http://i.imgur.com/72iIQzl.png) in the 3rd comic and the [spy] (http://i.imgur.com/o5igdcf.png) are the types of drawings I want to hug.      Ninja Edit; You should publish these to Imgur instead of just hosting them there, people love drawings and comics.   I hope they listen to the Loch and RS complaints. Also BFB. Danger Shield too. #unnerfheavy2k15   Somehow a Jontron link didn't make me laugh.   I got banned from a server for doing that, so I went back on an alt and walked infront of players and got 2 people banned.    That's a garbage weapon that could have been so good but it sucks. *insert lenny here*   I think that's what makes people call you a scrub, the more damage you do the more salt you spill.   Heavy doesn't have many options for gameplay, I guess tickling people is an alternate way to play.   :]   Use this set and nobody can hate you.   Iron Bomber.   ScotRes.   Pain Train.      Only the Pain Train is good here but people think it sucks, there's no way somebody would get mad at this.   This guy is clearly Py*pro*, different type of player entirely!      *Disclaimer, /u/test_subject7026 does not see Pyro as a noob class he has just played alot of pubs lately as Pyro and people yelled at him for being good*   Bowing down.   I find that using the Huntsman makes the salt pour onto the baguette faster if you know what I'm sayin'.   What the fuck lol   And that other thing is the Crossbow because who cares about fairness amirite?   Can you screenshot your custom folder? That shouldn't be a part of any hud.      Although you could be the dude who only ever plays Vow Medic or Spy.   spy is noob class no explanation necessary    Is also great   Scout is noob class he runs too fast   Soldier is noob class shoot feet get kills   pyro is noob class wm1 get kills demo is noob class m1m2m1m2   Heavy is noob class click get bullets   engineer is noob class make robot get kills   sniper is noob class click head get kills   medic is noob class don't even kill anyone   spy is noob class no explanation necessary    If a Pyro uses his Flamethrower to throw flames, it's W+M1 no skill just kill.      Use right click more than left click? Too stupid to use flames so he uses airblast.      Puff n Sting is 'skilless' too. Left click, right click, scroll down, left click.      Reserve Shooter is considered to lack skill too.      Even if you snipe with the Flare Gun you're getting yelled at for being a mindless noob.      Is there anything that a Pyro can do that won't make people call him out for being bad?   Provision sounds awesome.   I don't know if anyone got the *currently* joke. I'm very proud of it though.   "where can i buy a sweet pirate hat for my tf2 spy cosplay"      This is something I googled and I feel safe in saying I am alone on this.   http://i.imgur.com/cUxAWPo.png   It needs a buff. It *currently* can't random crit which is a very bad stat to have, if they removed the no metal from dispensers part the weapon would be viable, it should also have Widowmaker type stats where dealing damage returns metal.      If those stats got implemented then the SC would be good.      ^^^/s   I'm telling Mrs. Higglesnatch about what you two did. You're in serious trouble Prendar!      Wazoo.   *Excuse you?*   How is that? Because I have a picture of an amazing player on my wall?   Callouts in a nutshell   Backstabs are instant kills on unaware classes, Amby headshots are about the same damage as a rocket, sapping.            A Spy giving fantastic Engineer tips? That's probably why you got downvoted.

Demoman and Soldier and Sniper and Spy are already stronger. Also Engineer counters Scout.      Haha.   The issue with melee fights in Counter Strike is that knives are used to run fast.   The issue with melee fights in Call of Duty is that the only way I know to hold a knife is to use the shooty knife.   Minecraft is either swords or bows.   I've never played any other fighting games :[]   [I like how these three comments] (http://i.imgur.com/qiH6aOu.png) show that he's wrong about what he just said too.   He talked shit about hats. Downvotes are expected here.   He used the term 'retarded' which is an insensitive term in most cases, including and especially when it comes to hats.   And then there's a comment with upvotes because he was correct.      There are comments with ~-30 points, while the other ones have ~-5. If people truly did downvote all his posts there would be more consistent negative comments.      He even asked why something was being downvoted when clearly it was because he claimed to be able to "jump into any online fps and not be a noob" and that "not everyone starts out a noob" which is one of the stupider things I've seen there.      This dude clearly doesn't understand much.   Not even a bot, first post ever from this dude.   You ever hang out with Obama?   And everyone loves it every few weeks or so!   He didn't make it! How can you know about the guy without knowing that he didn't make it?   Did you have a stroke while typing?   I swear I get characters wrong every post I make.    Why would you want it removed?   Whu-what animation is this?   Praise be in the name of the one true god.   I feel bad for the guy, he is a scumbag but he's pretty cool on stream. Also he has an amazing voice that I love to hear.   If you killed Chell and cut off her hair maybe.   Pretty much any of Sniper's lines. They're all so great to hear. I just love his raspy voice.   Y'know what I do every morning when I wake up? I say "Yo, Merry Christmas!" and then I post NSFW content to Reddit to boost my link karma sky high.   Brag all you want, [I'm bragging] (http://steamcommunity.com/id/MrLoak/inventory/#440_2_3814274587)   No random crits really makes it trash. ^^/s   Uh, sure. You don't need all the punctuation marks.   I show them when I'm really not into going out that night, I do hang out with people all the time but sometimes I want to stay home and they'll see that I'm "Busy" with something.      Also people will respect me as a player and stop with the hackusations , I got like 4 headshots and "Yo this dude is probably hacking."   Sometimes I get invited to social gatherings, I can show them I have 4,000 hours spent in a game and they'll be like "Woah dude uhh, maybe some other time I can see you're busy with games huh."   I'm starting to leave my game on overnight, I want to hit 4,000 total hours by 2016.   Hello, DJ.   Thank you for contacting Steam Support.      Fuck you lol.      Sincerely, the dudes that made CS:GO and DOTA.   Wow, I am actually impressed kind of.

God I love the Direct Hit.   [Kritzkreig BONK!] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K56soYl0U1w)   I started playing CS:GO a few days ago...   "Thomas are there spies here? I think I bumped one."   "Something something Ambassador bullshit something headshotting."   "AWPer Hand is nowhere near this good dude, Valve should buff the shit out of this."   I think I yelled "BONUS CHICKENS" when I saw that chickens give you 1 point.   Can someone explain to me why no headshots is even on the CC as a downside? Aren't downsides meant to be downsides from the stock?   Also where is the Overdose, that thing is great.          Crusader's crossbow isn't that offensive and the bullets don't heal all that well either.    Let me stop you right fucking there. Medic is a Medic. Medic is a healer, not a fighter.   You aren't meant to heal with the bolts more than the Medigun, it's for distance healing, fire it into a Soldier on low hp from a rollout and he can jump to wherever you are to get healed from the Medigun.   Cream Spirit is both, just get that.   The fact that it's a pub.   I want to make a joke about the dude who uses this sub named Frontier_Justice, but I have no jokes left.   Play MvM as like Scout or something until you get some tours under your belt. I know that I, along with most of the other MvM players would see a 0 tour Spy and tell you to go Heavy or get kicked.      Spy isn't that good for MvM anyway though.    Well for that Pyro to exist there needs to be a Demo who also never misses. I know the Loch is easy to hit with, but let's assume there's a pro Pyro and a pro Demo who aren't robots.      The Demo shoots one pill that gets reflected, then he hits the Pyro with the second pill, then he misses the last one.      Loch takes a small amount of skill to aim but that doesn't mean it always hits. Even a Scout can counter the LnL by jumping, Medic as a whole counters Loch due to overheal which doesn't seem to exist in discussion.      Yes the Loch does need a nerf, no the loch is not horribly overpowered.      Also it's like 2am for me so that's why my structuring for this reply is probably trash.   The kids found you, look out!   The reverse is worse. Trust me I've seen my Nazi friends die from sneaky french man too many times.   This is a pretty shitty rename if I'm being honest. It's also very unoriginal.    I'm a pretty good Pyro, I've reflected Crusader's Crossbows and Flares, Loch n Loads are very easy to reflect. I'm not even a great Pyro and I can reflect extremely fast projectiles that go faster than the Loch n Load.      There are people much much better than I am who can reflect Loch pills by looking at them.   You have computer AIDS, remember those naughty sites you visited? They gave you computer AIDS.   THIS GAME IS A SACK OF SHIT!      Ok cool see ya later.   I don't understand why people kept going into that room, there's nothing there but death.   I'm a fancy motherfriender.   Now you can't ever use that shotgun again or you'll invalidate this post.   [Dispensers should be close to the engineer for extra coolness though] (http://i.imgur.com/cAibBEj.png)   Your previous works are amazing, possibly around the 5th best I've seen on this Subreddit.

I use all of these bar the Market Gardener and Shitty Medic, enjoy being killed in MGE daily!   Let me stop you at Direct Hit. First of all reflecting rockets is already extremely easy, the only time the reflecting is hard is when the Soldier is standing right infront of you, if reflecting DH rockets is so hard you're probably bad at reflecting in general.      Secondly, people use it for the denial of Rocket Jumping and the Instant Kill potential on 125 HP classes.   Wuh- What th- 'Yes' What the hell does that mean? This isn't a Yes/No question I'm asking which one it is! What the hell are you talking about!?   You mean the Original or the Stock?   I think /r/tflewd allows fanfic, as long as it's sexy.   YES!      Sorry, I was picturing the [Gendo Train.] (http://imgur.com/lsoomRq)      Sorry.   Direct Hit Soldier for me, I cannot aim with The Stocket Launcher, I just can't use splash effectively.   What does HMB mean exactly? All I can find are workout supplements.  :[   Internet fluid container?   [ye] (http://i.imgur.com/XMfPgVr.jpg)   Now that you mention it, that is pretty interesting. The same principle almost applies in pubs, people would probably be running Stock or Kritz because they are the most effective in the hands of good and bad players, but the Vaccinator is horrendously bad in a bad players hands and a good player would be using Stock/Kritz because they are more effective.      Also the player they uber gains more out of those ubers I guess.   To be fair, if your team is good enough you shouldn't need to revive that much.   I discussed and used one insult at the end to drive home my point. So now allow me to retort. *Moron.*   Direct Hit, I got so good with it that people get mad at me for using it. Maybe if they stopped lining their Gunboats with salt and tried walking instead of jumping at me they could have used sugar instead.   It was an insult. I insulted you. Now here you are trying to act like you're the top dog of the internet because my insult hurt you deeply.   I can airshot, but only in the rhythm of the song I'm listening to. It's like walking to the beat of a song but instead of looking dumb I look awesome.  	113
 Thank you for the feedback, but I feel that restricting the dialogue to between two parties is an essential component to the narrative. You can interpret it as a physical prison, but also as a psychological one. redacted. The narrative structure is a device allowing a more open interpretation.

    I'm actually looking at buying a tank. I really like the convenience of not re-dripping as often.   I really did feel very uncomfortable and intimidated. It was upsetting that he felt the need to do that. I'm not cop-shaming or saying all cops are bad, but he didn't do anything to reverse the bad image cops already have. Little things like that make me mad.   I used to have an m80 with a plume veil RDA, but I sold it to a friend and now I have an ABS dual 18650 box mod with a Royal Hunter. I like it quite a bit, actually.   My brother is a long-time user of vapes and ejuice. He originally used it to ease himself off his chronic cigarette use, but he's now turned it into a hobby. He got me into it and I purchased a decent mod and RDA.   I'm just wondering how many people here vape as well?   I do this trip two to three times a week on my way home. I stop by my local 711, pick up a lemon iced tea and a pack of Zig-Zag grape wraps. Usually the same employee is there to greet me each time I enter the store, and he remembers what I get and has the wraps waiting for me by the time I make it back to the counter with my iced tea in hand. Today, however, was different. There was a new employee this afternoon, and upon my request for the Zig-Zags, she sighed, gave me a dirty look, and took her time placing them on the counter. At this point a police officer is standing next to me paying for a coffee and a newspaper. He glances down at the counter, notices the wraps, and says to the cashier, "Do not sell those to him" in a stern, police-man voice. Now just listen to me really quick. I am your typical white kid. I have longer hair, but I usually pull it back so it looks neat and I don't come off as being a dirty hippy. I'm completely inconspicuous and have been living in the area and frequenting that 711 for as long as I can remember. Obviously someone buying blunt wraps sets off a red flag. Nobody I know buys them to actually roll their own cigars. But still! The cashier pauses, looks at the officer, smiles awkwardly, scans the wraps, and places them in the bag. He repeats himself again, "Do *NOT* sell those to him." This time you could tell he was serious. At this point the two of us are just standing in complete silence with confused looks on our faces. She hands me the bag and says the usual "Have a nice day" as I leave the store. I get in my car, pull back onto the road and notice the cop is behind me. He follows me for a good while, turning whenever I turn. I start getting a little paranoid, but know there's nothing wrong in the inherent act of purchasing the wraps; it's what I plan on doing with them  later that I don't want Mr. Policeman to see. I finally take the last turn onto my street and he continues on his route. I was more annoyed than anything during that encounter. I live in a city where it is decriminalized and not completely legal and can understand why that may have happened, but for the officer to tell the cashier not to sell them to me made me upset. What would you guys have done if you were put in a similar situation?  Hoping for the best future for the ents and their trees.   Was...was he okay?    Buy a good sharpstone. Mine was $50, it's anodized, and it's on the bigger side ( I think 2.5-3"). I've had it for over a year and I use it very frequently. It's the only grinder my buddies and I use so it gets plenty of use. It feels nice in the hand, is very smooth when griding, and I definitely recommend it.    Indica puts me right to bed and it doesn't let me enjoy my high. I prefer sativa   Sharpstones!   My last year as undergrad ME  	11
 they are as useless as tits on a bull   the greens would probably try   i think more places are going to implement something like this people are sick of having meals ruined by screaming kids   can't blame them the stench of urine they often leave behind is disgusting  not to mention you often have to play dodge the syringe and goon cask in many areas they sleep   You're a fucking idiot  It kills the nightlife because you can't get in or move to a different pub or club if it dies out or if you want to meet up with other people  The only place you can get into is the casino and that's not a good place for a night out     They were and it's destroyed Sydney's nightlife  The vast majority of people never caused a problem no matter how drunk they are it was a handful of dickheads that caused The issues  Fucking sick of this nanny state and the population that keeps supporting shit like this   People just don't find women's sport as entertaining as the mens..    For me it's like watching a local team play as the quality is just not The same  Sorry but that's just the reality of the situation...  If the quality was on par with the mens it  would get more followers   I'm referring more to popular sports like cricket,soccer,football etc   people might watch the womens tennis more for a perve but the quality of the matches compared to the men is no where near the same.. when some of the better female players retire i don't think the perve aspect will be enough   no chance it doesn't have the following to take a prime time tv spot as it's not as interesting as men's sport  why would tv stations sponsors and advertisers waste money on something that has a small following   no one will watch it and the reason why is not sexism or anything like that  women's sport just isn't as interesting as the men's it's like watching a local team play if you compare the two  it's the main reason why people don't watch it and because of that it doesn't attract sponsors and advertising and what not to get prime time tv spots.   no company would buy one imagine how much business they would lose if the truck had to recharge before making the last delivery or something   for it to work it would need to last longer than a few hours considering how long and far truck drivers drive each day  no company is going to buy a truck that runs out of juice in a few hours (likely in the middle of nowhere with no charging station)   electric trucks won't be a thing until they can go miles and miles without a charge.   on the roads they use there are no charging stations i can't see people running out to get trucks that for years would be useless   that won't go over well with voters a large majority of people don't want open borders   nah i love seeing buffering on every video i watch   they need better education not scare campaigns and to make it a health issue not a criminal one  the current way just isn't working and will just get worse until they actually treat the users instead of charging them  even if they end up in jail they still have access to it because no jail in the world is drug free   it won't happen under any government for years too many people still think the drug war is a good idea  its why they have no fucking clue what to do about ice except the usual scare campaign ad   it's going to cause fights   so what if you just went into a shop for a second to get something and someone decides to smash your window?  can see many fights starting over this   hate it when people bring up politics or religion at parties it's just fucking annoying and always causes problems   big fucking no on playing in women's sport it's massively unfair    nah they like the internet and the devices made in sweat shops to access it  give it a day or two they'll forget all about nestle   another thing for people to pretend to care about you'll still buy nestle products even after reading or watching the video.. they make a hell of a lot of stuff  just like you buy iphones and clothes and everything else made in sweat shops and other slave labour but you don't seem to care about that   i think people will now see that uber is a evil company that doesn't give a fuck about it's workers  everyone is just in a "honeymoon period" with them because they have better service than most taxis   it would be vandalised more by drunk passengers than taxi drivers  driverless taxis in a city at night with drunk people is a terrible idea   it's a recipe for disaster  too many dickheads would vandlise them puke in them smoke in them do lines in them etc   they really shouldn't be although i do understand it's hard to always take time off when your sick  fucking hate it though when a co-worker comes in sick makes everyone sick   it would be unfair to get rid of him for next year considering the car is rubbish  that would be a crap way to end his f1 career     i honestly think that was a Google marketing ploy to see if there was interest in a phone like that  not long after that went viral there was suddenly an announcement that a phone like that was in the works for like a year or so already    The company is working on a project which could provide the key to human immortality. Teaming up with Dr. Arthur Levinson, Google are working on ways to slow down the human aging process.  overpopulation is already becoming a problem we really don't need people living a lot longer than they already are   good! nothing more annoying than screaming kids who often run around a restaurant because parents can't control them  if parents had tried to control the kids (took them outside to cool off or left if they didn't behave) this ban wouldn't be in place     actually they often end well.. lots of people don't want meals ruined by screaming kids who often run around a restaurant because parents can't control them   ISIS controls a great majority of a country and is slaughtering people they are a big threat in that region  you can't compare them to a battle 2000 years ago   yes it would wars haven't really had a frontline in a while so even if "real armies" where attacked by a force of 600 or so terrorists it would make a footnote   that's not going to happen   happens with every boycott/controversy etc etc people pretend to care for a few days while it's trending then move on to the next thing  most people have already forgotten about Qatar   i find the dickhead cyclists that wear all black at night a bigger problem  i've seen some riding without a reflector on the back as well   just asking to be run over   your sensitive ass is costing millions to fix the sewage system as you and others flush them down the toilet  everyone ends up paying for that one way or the other   why would they be paid a big amount of money when most people are not even watching it?  billions tune in for the men's world cup most people don't even know or care about the women's world cup   some of them think it's the tour de france in shared pathways   meh it's the women's world cup it's like watching a local team play if you compare it to the men's  that's why women's sport just isn't as popular as the men's   don't get why these idiots boast on the police facebook page they'll fucking track it  the guy looks like a retard anyway and probably won't even be trying to hide IP and what not      they just want to break some more laws bunch of cockroaches on wheels   the hate comes from the fact the guy is overhyped and seems to have a big head because of it.. people are already calling him a future world champion and what not  plus not taking the blame for the Monaco crash saying he was brake tested didn't help either   The black market will reform if you do that   if you make it hard or expensive to get it legally people will just buy them illegally    shit like this happens all the time doesn't matter if your homeless or not  it's the same when someone has a serious car accident.. most people just drive past maybe 1 out of ten will stop to help   don't be so sure about that people will walk past anyone   Ferrari lucked into that podium they have some work to do   rain expected in 15 minutes    ever since Ferrari did that upgrade they have been pretty shit seems like they have gone downhill   missed the fucking start due to shit streams   hopefully to change things up  besides he's also paying $26 for the win on my betting site  	54
 Oh god yes   I peed in my best friends sink all over the dishes. I didn't tell them.   Do you mean mangria? Man + sangria?   She and everyone in their "church" are a waste of human life.   My dad conditioned me to say soda water. I say both coke and soda water interchangeably. I had a cousin visit from up north and it unnerved me when she said "pop".   Fapping at that age: pretty normal Geting into fetishes at that age: cause for concern   Maybe it his only way of release because he might not be able to get any.   It's how the Nazis found her. She was sending tweets.   It was a clever trick, but he needs to realize we'll always find him.   I like the Joker one. Wear that.   People walking into a donut shop near a half marathon-*scandalous*   I guess EVERYONE WHO FUCKING DRAWS CARTOONS better stop drawing Asians with squinty eyes while we're at it too.   I thought the mixed berry looked like ground beef at first   It's the company name   What I hate is that it'll get hot in Texas and then all of the sudden a cold front decides to come on down and freeze us.   This is so cool! Happy for OP!!!   Jayden from fratmen   d'awwww   This isn't funny. It's disturbing.   They'd have to put fake nipples on them.  *Think about it*.   A repost is a repost. No one likes that shit.   This was on the front page already, if I'm not mistaken   Something a kid wrote. Calm down. Obviously can't spell.   My friends did that too! Because I was in a foul mood already, I didn't really dance. I don't want to so I just sat at the table wishing I had a spiked drink! I'm sorry you had such a shitty time.   Oh please let it be a sign from the drag goddesses.   I wouldn't have minded dropping the money, if it had been with a boy. I hope you enjoyed it though. My friends tried their best but I ended up going home early and raiding my parents liquor cabinet.   I felt out of place junior year. It was also just a tough year for me because I was dealing with all my emotions and the thought that I should kill myself, which I almost did, but I'm glad I didn't. I made senior year different for myself and I brought a better attitude with me. I still didn't go because I kept longing for someone to spend it with in a intimate way, which friends can't do.   My dad told me a joke about a one eyed prostitute the other day.   Sounds like a really great guy. I only went to prom once with friends and I didn't go my senior year. I just wanted someone to go with me, I stayed home rather than go. I love my friends but sometimes it only does so much. I didn't want just my friends, I wanted it to be special and have a date, like everyone else had, like all of my friends had.   Alyssa gets drop dead GORGEOUS.   WERK   There's various pictures of Detox here standing with other people at the taping of the RuPaul's drag race reunion/coronation taping they did this past week. She went head to toe and this is the coolest look I've ever seen.   That's the T   I'm sorry about that. I'm just in a fighting mood today and haven't had a smoke in a while. I'm trying to quit and it sucks! I get really on edge when I don't have cigarettes.   Did I say it didn't? Voguing formed out of it as a dance. I know reading came first. It's just an expression saying that reading is fundamental. I'm not saying its fundamental to the dance, or that it came from it. I know reading came first. I'm may act like an idiot sometimes, but I'm not completely stupid.   It's fundamental. But vogue is a form of reading or shade.   Retouching? Honey, that's photoshop.   Yeah. They had a lot of big dreams. They came from the depths of society and it makes me feel thankful for what I do have, but I still see myself wanting to be as brave as they were in chasing after who they are through the medium they saw fit. I gained a lot of respect and pride trying to understand their lives. They made the best out of shit situations.       She did put it out on the front of pop culture, but she definitely took it. The thing I don't like is that I don't hear much of her crediting those who created the style. I hate that about Madonna. She takes the credit and never gives it.   Madonna never created it. She borrowed the style, the mentality of voguing, and adapted it to her own taste, then put it into song. It's been a crucial part of the culture there in New York long before she did anything with it.   Yes   It is. It's one of the few documentaries that I watch regularly.   It's from the documentary "Paris Is Burning." It's a style of dance created in gay culture and is known as voguing.   It's been here and on r/funny before.   His tits are just as good   I kind of like mine! "Beverly Spits" We have a cat named Spits.   It's cool. I was just trying to help you out there. It was just really vague. I misspelled explanation earlier and I even checked it before I posted. We all make mistakes. No big OP.   Sorry for sounding condescending. I was pointing out some things for OP to consider and thanks for pointing out my mistake. If I point out a mistake, I expect other people to do it for me, so apparently it happened even though I double checked before I posted that comment. Also, when did I become a large bundle of sticks?   Check your spelling before posting next time, and maybe give a bit more explanation as to what's in the jar instead showing it to us, and expecting us to know what's in there.   Bone marrow is good   Well I'm glad you're taking control. My parents sure didn't and I'd hate to see a kid go through the shit I did because of their weight. Grandparents are supposed to be those guys to spoil but even they should know when to stop so maybe just talk to your parents and/or in-laws about it. Packing him a healthy lunch for school might be something too. It's ok to indulge every now and again on sweets and junk but teach him that if that's all he eat, it's a very difficult road filled with many serious health complications. I know it's like I'm giving you a lecture but its all in best interest. Wish someone would've done it for me. Keep it up and best of luck!   You should do it more often   Oh god. She isn't even qualified to judge that show. I want to see a Grammy before you judge people's singing!   YES. 3   This was awful   Have you never cooked or experimented with brains before? If you're an executive chef (I'm only assuming that since its your sous chef) and you work at a high end place, how come you haven't ever done brains? Brains are good when prepared correctly.   Use it   The video isn't there anymore. CBS had a copyright claim and removed the video.   What about the fucking ouija board??   Did the people in your club perform or did you have someone well known come to perform?   I haven't heard Alaska sing live, I was going off of the challenge they did a few weeks back really haha. Glad to hear she's better than she was led to be in the show.   Roxxxy is just a pageant queen to be completely honest. I feel Ru isn't looking for that anymore. Jinkx can display glamour when asked, she's funny, she can really act and sing and for me that's the total package and what a superstar is. Alaska is almost in the same boat only because she can't sing. I like Alaska's style more than Jinkx's. Roxxxy is just all beauty and no substance IMO. Jinkx and Alaska are entertainers in all respects of the word, whereas Roxxxy is look.   I completely agree on that. You can blame the editing all you want but I really think they didn't have much to paint her differently. Her attitude was unacceptable on this episode and I feel there is no editing to blame for it. All Roxxxy right there.   Who is it   You should watch her on Willam's Beatdown on YouTube if you haven't already watched some of the episodes before. I look forward to Drag Race on Mondays, but then I yearn for the Beatdown on Fridays! She also does makeovers on a show on the same channel (The Stylish) called Transfashionable. Courtney Act is also on Transfashionable.   Where was this taken?   It was a mistake. It got screwed up and sent it twice.   It's Octomom.. That's 8 different babies in there   That is correct. He was just the voice, he wasnt physically under the mask.   That is correct. He was just the voice, he wasnt physically under the mask.   That is correct. He was just the voice, he wasnt physically under the mask.   It looks like a dildo...   Apparently he's a water bender   Most of it gets put on reddit first though.

 SSLauncher is my favorite when I want to take the time to customize it. It's gridless, the widgets can be overlapped, and it can have a banner area at the top following different rules. It takes a bit to find all the options, it's not the most user friendly. But with SSLauncher, Zooper, UCCW, and Desktop Visualizer there is literally nothing I haven't been able to come up with on my home screen. Get or make custom icons and fonts, and the sky's the limit. However, all this has a high learning curve (not Tasker high, but nothing is Tasker high) and to make what I want can take hours.      I wish the home screens I posted on Google+ groups stuck after I deleted the pics from my account, some were fantastic. It's been a good while since I've been willing to put in the time to make a new one. One day I'll get into it again, just not today.   Yeah, I have around 20 as well, but only really watch Netflix, Plex, and Hulu Plus. I got Sling TV, but am waiting for that subscription to lapse. I really want to stay away from a $20 a month channel, kinda defeats the purpose of cordcutting. If they had more content I would watch, I might do it.   Oh my god, she's a freaking superhero!   Plex pulls them from TVDB, where contributors try to pick a scene which differentiates that episode from others. I like them, often times they remind me what that episode is about better than the title.   I do have a thing for show and season posters being nice and matching, but episodes are fitting to me.   That being said, I totally understand taking the time to fix up Plex. And if you're the only person who cares at all, I understand that too. :)    [Clocky]( http://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B002SGEAS2/ref=mlt_B000TAS9XQ_B002SGEAS2#) was my solution.    No use for it. And if you are playing at night, it's kind of a "shoot me" beacon. Plus you start out with 4 slots in your jeans and that's it.   Well, if you're looking for variety, Buzz Launcher lets you download and share homescreens. Pretty nice if you're looking to change things up now and then.   **DayZ**    I got this one when it was first offered on Steam, pre-alpha I think they called it. Tried it for about an hour, then didn't try again. Until a couple weeks ago.    DayZ is the ultimate post-apocalyptic survival game. They try to keep it as realistic as possible, and they're doing a good job for a game that still hasn't hit beta yet.    Perma-death - You start out with a shirt, jeans, shoes, flashlight, and battery. (Nobody doesn't throw away the flashlight and battery right from the start.) Your shirt will end up getting torn into rags to bandage yourself and stop bleeding. But not to fear, you search for bigger and better, constantly upgrading your belongings and equipment, for as long as you live. But when you die, that's it. Game over. If you're lucky and live long enough to find a tent, you can store items in it and it will stick around through server restarts (every 4 hours generally), but odds are you won't, and will lose everything you've worked for. Respawn, and you have a shirt, jeans, shoes, flashlight, and battery.    No Rules - Seriously, no rules. This game brings out the worst in people. When you kill someone, you can even cut them up and eat them. When you're lying unconscious and can hear people talking, "hehehe We're gonna EAT you" is a rather disturbing thing to hear. People will say "Hey, friendly here. Need any food or anything? My friends are over here" to you when you're a bambi (freshly spawned player), lead you to a group of friendly guys, and shoot you in the back of the head. Trust no-one. Don't trust the guy you spawned with and have been running around scavenging and killing zombies with all afternoon. The ONLY folks I've found I can trust so far are those I meet up with on TeamSpeak. Safety in numbers is a real concern, and TeamSpeak is the only way to really communicate effectively. Outside of TeamSpeak, I've rarely encountered anyone who won't kill you just because. And everything makes noise. Drinking, eating, walking, reloading, everything. If you're hiding, you better not be doing anything at all.    Zombies - You would think they play some sort of role, but really they're just things to avoid or get out of the way. That's it. It's all about surviving the other players, not the zombies. Although they will kill you, make no mistake about that.    Weapons - Snipers rule the world.  If you're running, you better be  zigging and zagging, ducking and dodging. Of course, turning a corner into a shotgun isn't healthy either.  So really, the only obstacle I found in learning to play DayZ is getting past the evil of the other players. Once I accepted the fact that it's acceptable on all fronts to lie, cheat, steal, murder, cannibalize, etc. (which is kinda rare in games) the game got much better. It's all about survival. There are no goals other than to kill or be killed. And never get attached to anything, you're going to die and lose all. It's inescapable.    Oh look, someone spawned in. Target practice has begun.   Yes, it gets much better. Drag yourself through the first season, and when the new Doctor shows up, you're going to love him. As with every Doctor, it takes a bit of getting used to the new one, but the stories get better, and soon there with be overlying story arcs to entire seasons. You're going to come across episodes that are fantastic. There are lots of stand-alone stories, but that's kinda what the Doctor does. He travels time and space, always popping up where he's needed.   lol You're going to get downvoted. But I do love Donna, and Eccleston's first season did get me excited to have a reboot.   I would think that watching it would be my loss.   They made her mouth too wide.   How could the show's staff not be found guilty of some felonies?   Loved the movie. I remember watching the ad for the first time during a super bowl and knowing I had to see it. Wasn't disappointed.   Keanu, however, once again lacked any kind of depth in his acting. It's almost like watching Eminem act. The only movie of his that makes him seem like he can act is, in my mind, Bill and Ted's.   The Room   IMDB rating - 3.5 out of 10   Rotten Tomatoes Tamatometer - 33%   Rotten Tomatoes Audience Score - 47 %   This is one that has never appeared nearly interesting enough to bother watching, and I don't see that changing anytime soon.    One of the most over-rated films out there. It's hardly some masterpiece, it's quite good at best. All in all, I found it a bit boring, and wouldn't watch it again. And I love to rewatch movies.

Today I dug in and read through bunches of posts in forums and finally stumbled on the answer someone posted. I've been staring at this account with the error message on it forever. It's like I've scratched an itch that's been out of reach.   Disconnect your internet connection   Open Mail   Go to the corner, bring up the bar, goto settingsaccounts   Select the account to delete   Scroll down and there's your remove button     If nothing else works, try putting them in separate folders.   LOL You're kidding, right? I've been trying to contact them all week. I finally got my hands on a phone number today, called and waited for 50 minutes. This phone company I called COULDN'T HEAR ME TALKING and ended up hanging up on me. Seriously. Terrible customer support. The only luck I'm having so far is through Twitter, but I still am having trouble with getting help. I think "freedompop" actually means "me and a few friends in my mom's basement."   I've been pointing people with questions about permissions to this post on Phandroid for years. It doesn't answer app specific questions, but it definitely expands on permission descriptions.    [Android permissions explained, security tips, and avoiding malware](http://androidforums.com/threads/android-permissions-explained-security-tips-and-avoiding-malware.36936/#permissions)   Every time I see BEST ______ EVER! I have complete faith that whatever it is they are talking about is not, in fact, the best ever.   So far, I've always been right.   Andmade Share I always install, along with More Shortcuts    Linkme: More Shortcuts    Pretty much all answers go back to the rhyme I grew up with...    We're the boys   From Illinois   We live in caves and ditchs   We beat our cocks   On jagged rocks   We're mean sons a bitchs   Did that have a guy with a barcode on the back of his neck on the cover?   I know, it's crazy, I really wish I could remember exactly what causes it.    I had the same problem. I had to go on my computer and mess around with accounts until I finally got it. I couldn't tell what I did, just lots of fiddling around. I really don't understand exactly the links between account name and gmail account, it's just odd and difficult to figure out what causes me to log into one account or the other. Everything is settled in now, when I log into different accounts everything works, but it didn't at first, and I don't know what I did to straighten it all out.   That sounds promising, thanks!   Excellent! Thank you so much!    lol That was yours? To be fair, it was one of the first ones I listened to, stumbled on it just as I was getting into Secret World. If I remember right, I was in and out of it between SWC episodes, so I probably didn't jump in and binge listen like I usually do. It's on my short list of pods to listen to again. I do that when I can't remember many details. I'll be sure to shoot you an update of a better informed opinion. It had a fight on a bridge and later on in their HQ, right? And something about betrayal within the ranks?    Oh, you guys are reading comics? Excellent.   This is the first vid of yours I watched, and now I'm hopping around your other ones. This is what I imagined dayz to be. Sadly, my experience is nowhere near this yet. But some day...   Now that makes perfect sense. Excellent advice, thank you.   True, but I doubt *everybody* would be liars, killers, and thieves.   It's *extremely* hard to find new material to listen to, no place I've looked that lists/collects/shares podcasts/podiobooks/audiobooks has a superhero genre to search through that I've found, it's all science fiction, alternate reality, etc, just stuck in anywhere it might fit, so I have to look through pretty much everything. I'm not sure if my Google-Fu isn't up to snuff, or there just isn't much out there. Every couple of months I hunt again, and am lucky to find 1 new podcast or podiobook. Not really expecting to get anything new here, but I figured it's worth a try. Some stuff I have/am listening to...    Worm Audiobook - My current favorite, almost caught up.   The Secret World Chronicles - Top of the bunch, I think.   How to Succeed in Evil - Freaking awesome.   Playing for Keeps - Another fav, excellent story.   The Legion of Nothing - Couldn't really love this one, dunno why.   Other People's Heroes - Wasn't bad, liked it.   Axiom-man - Another ok story, liked it.    I think that's almost all of them, I may have missed some I don't remember. But, I just have to put some stuff out there that I really loved that wasn't superhero oriented...     Anything by Scott Siglar - The king of podiobooks, freaking excellent stuff.   7th Son series - Just awesome + a little more awesome.   Space Casey - More like a radio serial, but I loved it.   The Heavenfield - Took a while to get into, but well worth it.   Trader Tales - For a story with a slower pace, this was really good.   Heaven series - Pretty out there, pretty good.   Black Jack Justice - From Decoder Ring Theater, there's something about the patter I can't get enough of.    So if anything here sounds familiar to you, and you're liking the same stuff, PLEASE holler out. I listen to podiobooks/audiobooks exclusively in the car, and it's hard coming up with new stuff I really love anymore. I really love podiobooks much more, since they're written not to be read, but listened to. It changes things, imo.    TL:DR My ears need fed, please throw me superhero audio ideas (except podcasts talking about them, I'm just looking for stories.)  edit: didn't proofread good enough   Why in the world would there even be a wiki entry for that?   The Monster at the End of This Book. I remember my dad doing the Grover voice for it, and I ended up doing it for my daughter. It was the first book she loved as well. She's eleven now, but I bet if I set it out she'd ask me to read it to her.   Sidenote: I know this has a bit of a rant, but thank you guys much for not blasting me for that.   Well, I can't agree with that. It may be perma-kill, but you get as many lives as you wish. I would think that in real life people would band together more to keep the one life they will ever get.   Oh, wait, that's exactly how life is. :)   [Best tip I've gotten so far.](http://dayzdb.com/map)   I'm still learning the game. So far I've gotten geared up a couple of times, went looking for others to maybe get in on a team or something, and headed for Electro. So far, when I've come across others, I've tried to get the drop on them and give them a chance to be friendly. Nope. I've made 1 kill so far on a guy who came at me after I told him to be cool and I wouldn't kill him. The rest of my encounters with others have yielded zero chances to make any friends at all. I did meet a guy once who spared me on spawn once, but he was streaming Twitch so I think he probably had to. The rest of everyone I've met has either lied and said they have a group of friends we can go meet (which means follow me so we can kill you somewhere safe to loot you) or killed me outright.   I understand this is a game with no rules, but jesus fucking christ, put SOME kind of incentive for people not to be asshats. It's like they made a game where everyone is supposed to be evil. Am I missing something? Are public servers just the wrong places to be? Or is this a game just for cowardly assholes who enjoy lying and killing anyone weaker? Is there a place off-game to find friends? Because in-game sure isn't working out for me.   Ah, I see. And I see there's a hive column on the server list. It all makes perfect sense now, why sometimes while server hopping I'd have previous stuff and sometimes not.   Thanks, I kinda thought that was what it was. How do I tell what servers belong to the same hive?      Meh, I know how slow a business can move on something with low priority. And it can easily be simply thrown aside. My personal forecast is that things will slow to a halt and stall out.   So I am simply content with TF2 these days, since no other mmorpg has that CoH feel to it.    I've had hipster pizza in N. VA, it's$25 tops. I've had 4 star restaurant pizza in Georgetown (Wash DC), it wasn't more than $25 either. Where the hell are you?   So, what are they supposed to put on their cereal?   lol and I know I'll deserve it, I can't fault you for that.    [Here you go.](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=FORTIS+exoskeleton)   Sigh. I'm guilty of this. Not here in the midwest, but when I'm around DC I do. Anyone who navigates the beltway at rush hour knows that certain dicks will rush up 495 N in the right lane then suddenly get left to get on the 270 spur. Yeah, that's me. I just can't help it. Then when 270 is about to turn into 2 lanes and some pricks will fly up the right lane, going around folks trying to merge until hitting the very end of the lane? Me again. It's gotten that I know what lane to be in at what section of highway I'm on. I find the open spots, I don't cause people to swerve or slam brakes or anything, but I be that asshat.    hamplanets  TIL a horrible, derogatory term for overweight person. I love it.   lol I've gotten into the bad habit of asuming everyone lives in Northern VA. Richmond is a bit of a hike.    Just head to the district. :)    Where does it say the teachers filled his head with that?    Holy shit, what *wouldn't* confuse someone?   How is the existence of a god easily dis-proven?   Is he even asking for information about it? /r/atheism seems to get pissed when Christians (or whoever) try to tell them why their own point of view is so great, I kinda think the other way around is the same.   Morals don't require religion to exist.   So no, he would be very, very far from an ideal atheism poster-boy.      Wow, bitter much? It's someone they care about and have always respected in the past. All would take is a pleasant-toned discussion between the two of them to get her to back off. Seems like a much better alternative than to ostracize someone who they're going to have to work with each day. Think ahead, don't burn bridges unnecessarily when they can easily be modified to work for you just as well as they ever had.   	62
 More proof that Global Warming fanaticism is a religion and not a science.   Redistribution of wealth sounds great when you are an idealistic high school student.  However it has one practical flaw that you won't appreciate until you earn a paycheck.  To give money to someone, you must take it from someone else.   "environmental justice"   aka shakedown whitey.      One leg at a time.   More taxpayer-funded luxuries for our masters in Washington DC.      Smackdown of the anti-liberty, Green fascists.      Climate change!!!!!!      "Wahhhh it's just not fair!"  Life isn't fair kids.   It probably took you longer to take and post these pictures then to look for another place to put your bike.   Multiculturalism is a failed social experiment and the Muslim hoard will overrun Europe again.    We will have to find another Charles Martel.  It's only a matter of time.      No one is forcing anyone back to work, just like no one forces you to get pregnant.  Consequences.  They happen.      That's what centralized economic planning will get you.      Global warming!!!!!      Looks like [disregard for the public](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzH1BF7Hd1o) runs deep in Santa Ana.      Yes and now Saudis are funding the construction of hundreds if not thousands of mosques across America.   Remember, if you tried to stop him, he would have hurt you also.   "Three tons of him"      Please don't get your political leanings from TV shows.   If immigrants voted predominately Republican, Democrats would not be for open borders.         You've summarized /r/politics perfectly.      Riiight.  Republicans also kick puppies and shove old people down flights of stairs.   Journalism is dead.   Government employees driving the news. What could go wrong?          "The future does not belong to those who slander the prophet of Islam."  Barrack Hussein Obama  Edit: Why would you downvote the raw text of your God?      This article is baloney.  The guy is counting investment income also, which is rightfully taxed at the long-term rate of 15% percent, since it has greater risk.  Complete sham meant to drive the uniformed to support class warfare and socialism.       More proof that global warming fanaticism is not a science, but a political ideology.      Bullshit. In a civilized society you should be free from being beheaded for your beliefs.      Possible [eyewitness account.](https://twitter.com/alimhaider/status/606500612952326144/photo/1)         There is no rational reason that someone can't make it to the polls, which are usually open for 12 hours on election day, if they wish to vote.  Does it take longer than 12 hours for Democrats to travel to their neighborhood polling center?  Can you show me one documented case of someone that couldn't make it to their *neighborhood* poll in less than 12 hours of travel?   Get up early.  Vote on your lunch break.  Vote after work.   Vote anytime if you don't work.  Some states actually require employers to give you time off to vote!    There is absolutely no legitimate reason for early voting.      Early voting is actually a relatively new thing.    From Wikipedia, which I have not confirmed:    History of early voting in U.S. presidential elections  Year Early votes  2008 30.6%  2004 22%   2000 16%  1992 7%    I don't base my stances on if something is a "terrible thing" or not.  "The Congress may determine the Time of chusing [sic] the Electors, and **the Day** on which they shall give their Votes; which Day shall be the same throughout the United States.""   Because making everyone vote on the same day is racist.   /s   Edit: The founding fathers decided on one day for elections.  This was before cars, trains, etc.  Yet one single day for elections was deemed okay.   Ask yourself, why are the Democrats so opposed to only accepting votes on one day?          I bet he wasn't complaining about his paycheck.   Nothing is Obama's fault.  Ever.  Unless something goes right...   Liberals want money out of politics, provided that money is not foreign money going to the Clintons.   "Most transparent administration in history."  Obama's whole life has been a secret.  Why did we think his presidency would be any different?      Look at all that roaring water.  Climate change!!!   /s   They understand that money isn't created from thin air.   Mathematicians: 90 Democrats for every 10 Republicans.  This is simply not true.  Sorry.      Because possibly killing someone with a brick makes it all better.   "We have to pass it to find out what's in it."   The vilification of wealth and success by the left is driving class warfare and America's suicidal push towards socialism.    Some people have far more money than you.  Get over it.   Life isn't fair and it never will be.      She is welcome to walk next time.   "Privatizing social security"  "Social security" was private before it was public.  It used to be called being responsible and saving for your future.  Now that we've involved the federal government, this "safety net" will soon be insolvent.    Centralized power of social programs is an abhorrence.       The Constitutional concept of checks and balances is considered a racist, old fashioned idea on /r/politics....until a conservative is President.   Hillary would never have the courage to do this.   Of course not.  It's just another Clinton coincidence.   The Constitution clearly says anyone holding office cannot accept money from a foreign state.  It's cut and dry.  If we hadn't been wiping our asses with the Constitution for the past 50 years, Hillary would already be in prison.   Hillary Clinton has committed crimes, but watch the stream of excuses from the Reddit Democrats.         So the President does or doesn't have an impact on GDP?  You attempted to prove both sides in your post, but loyally kept your lips wrapped around Obama's organ.  Grab a Kleenex.      Meanwhile, Obama is busy "standing with the Muslims."         Just like Al Gore said the polar ice caps would be gone by now.  Meanwhile he is laughing all the way to the bank.   Yes. They sound like assholes.      Climate change!!   Boston has a historically cold winter---- "It's a single event and doesn't disprove climate change!"  Texas has a few days of flooding----- "Climate change!!"  Edit: When science is politicized, you get sheep like those in this thread.               While it's "working" in Europe, America has the most sought after universities in the world.  Why?  Hint: It has nothing to do with bureaucrats in Washington DC.   Here's his [Kentucky cousin.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gn8EQ0azXpQ)   You think college is expensive?  Just wait until it's "free".   Wahhhhh it's just not fair!!  	92
    about 600 feet to the end?   for those that aren't close do know they allow one set of campers to camp on site each night.  i think we paid $20 a person for two nights of camping and unlimited rounds.  we used their location as the hub for winter park and other activities.

Because what the hell is happening that means everyone needs a parachute?   Someone at my old highschool drove one. Pretty interesting cars.   I completely agree about Zombie EP. I love their new and old stuff, but Zombie EP was the top of their game.   I was going to give my own answer, but you hit the nail on the head.      My guy had a metal plate over half his face and the the rest just had a sheet with holes for the eyes and mouth over it. He scared me.   My sister broke her arm one day and then only a little later, my brother hit and cut his head pretty bad. The doctors hadn't even changed shifts when my dad went the second time. It was awkward.   There was nothing more terrifying than having my first panic attack while in the middle lane of a highway.    Tokyo fucking Drift. No complaints.   *salute*   Maybe ;)   Thanks :). I do plan on coming back when I'm less busy.   I probably will. I had a lot of fun here. I just don't have time right now.   I'm just too busy with college right now. I saw that people are expanding into Liechtenstein and Kaliningrad and I hope they treat the territories well. I just don't have the time ontop of terrible writers block. It was really fun though and I'll probably keep lurking and if I get a less busy schedule, I may rejoin. But until then, see you all. I was here for a while and it was great the whole way.

Hey, dude, I know what that's like. I would send you something but I'm a poor college student. I really do hope all these great people have brightened your day though. Happy Birthday!   Yeah, dude!   University of Colorado at Colorado Springs   I just thought I'd give a reason. I've been getting ready and packing and stuff and moved into my dorms today. I should be posting regularly again this week.   My dad and I know Teppei Teranishi from Thrice. We would take him to dinner before their shows in Colorado. He's a really cool guy.   Meta: Oh wait, it was misspelled. Well darn. Though he hasn't posted in over two weeks. I'm gonna have to ask the mods about this.   Yes, we negotiated Kaliningrad from Tuva. Was Leningrad claimed? I searched for a claim post and couldn't find one.   Hmm, I never saw your annexation. I'm not sure how to deal with this since Kaliningrad by itself was ceded to me and I don't believe other annexations can take over someone else's.   Thank you. We'll accept the workers whenever it's most convenient for you.   Extra workers and equipment may allow us to speed up the process from three years to two years if you're willing to provide it. And of course, we will allow Poland to have control over a to be determined portion of the ports that are built as long as we are on good terms.   Hchste Kaiser has given the Overseer of Kaliningrad permission to begin a three year project to expand Kaliningrad's ports in order to increase trade and tourism. To put it simply, there will be more docks to accommodate more trade and tourist ships and also newer docks to hold larger ships. We will also be expanding the shipyards to increase the output of ships built in Kaliningrad. We hope that this will improve Kaliningrad's economy and allow us to connect with more countries through trade all over the world.   Vote   Seeing that the old leader that Hchste Kaiser test_subject7429 left in charge has proven inactive and unfit for duty, our great leader has decided to appoint the oldest if his 5 children to be the overseer of the most recent addition to the land of Liechtenstein, Kaliningrad. He will be taking a similar role as the Hchste Kaiser, only he will be reporting to and taking direction from his father. His job will consist of taking care of smaller legislation, overseeing the economy, and commanding the military within Kaliningrad.   /r/subarugonewild   There is no sound. It's a video of the gif.   Yeah! I'm visiting from Colorado.   OH MY GAWD IM EEIN NEW YAWK   VOTE   I just landed in New York.   All of Kaliningrad.   I got lucky and found one for $80.

VOTE   After years and years of construction, planning, and various delays, the wall around the country has finally been completed. The wall itself stands at fifty feet and the top is lined with artillery, mounted guns, and soldiers. There are several access points into the country all throughout the wall with military checkpoints. Finally Liechtenstein has the safety its citizens have always deserved. Everyone may note, that this is not a closing of the borders like last time, but simply a (extremely expensive) safety precaution. Glory to Liechtenstein!  ~Hchste Kaiser /u/test_subject7429   I don't think I've ever heard any one not refer to it as a sequel. It may be a single movie and part of a story, but by definition, it's a sequel to the first movie.   Even the eagle itself is slanted. I like the theory!   Oh my god. I could never tell that that was an eagle in his eye before. I thought it was just an imperfection in his glass eye. I feel incredibly stupid now.   (Sorry, quick one because I'm on vacation.)  Liechtenstein annexed Kaliningrad, Poland = mad, Poland had been trying to get Kaliningrad, Poland not good enough, Poland declare war for Kaliningrad, Liechtenstein fights alone at first, everyone joins Liechtenstein before second battle, Poland surrenders.   Tune in next year for the usually unabridged news.  HCHSTE KAISER IS BEST KAISER!   I don't know why, but I fucking love that little car.   Ok, cool.   I'm not sure if being ceded Kaliningrad is an annexation, but I have that.   January 25th, the day the Poland conflict ended, will hereby be known as Recollection Day in remembrance for all citizens and soldiers of Liechtenstein lost in the Kaliningrad invasion and in any future conflict.  All but essential businesses such as hospitals will be closed on this day so that people may rest and remember those that selflessly fought for the freedom of others.   They have surrendered and continuing this conflict would only lead to more deaths for no cause at all.   I'll ask them to withdraw. I'll figure out what to do if any choose not to.   We thank each and every nation that helped us in our time of need and will repay you somehow. A peace treaty is in the works.   (If anyone wants to help me with that, that would be cool)   We accept this offer and will now be taking over the safe passage check points for traders to and from Kaliningrad. Perhaps over time, that deal may be struck again.    We thank you for ending this before more blood was shed.   Liechtenstein thanks you   Liechtenstein was ceded Kaliningrad without knowing that Poland had been in negotiations for Kaliningrad two separate times before. They believe that the land belongs to them rightfully, I disagree. If they weren't given it two prior times, they must have been seen as unfit.   ~Signed, Hchste Kaiser of Liechtenstein, /u/test_subject7429   Sorry about not having an updated wiki. I've been really busy :/   Like I really feel bad.   A bunch of people gave them warnings, South Africa is giving me some planes, but beyond that it would seem I'm the only one right now.  [Meta] Sorry I didn't get my conflict post, by the way. It was a friend's birthday.   Poland, I think.   Not at all, I was just clarifying.   [Meta] But I'm wondering if I should include them in my conflict post or if you're declaring war.   Question, are you going to be commanding them or are you loaning them to me?   Yessir   Ok, I get it.  I'm probably the marshal then.   So is the coordinator someone I make up? Or another player?   [Meta] Two questions  1: What's a battle marshal?  2: How will the defense points work because they're attacking my territory, not me directly?   Liechtenstein congratulates you on your coming to power! I would send you a gift if I weren't in a state of war.  Perhaps after.   Honestly, it's better than doing nothing at all.   Thanks for helping.   Thank you.   Any help is appreciated.   Thanks for the assistance.   I just feel that entering the borders against my will is kind of a war-y thing to do.  	91
 Yes!!! Thanks!    sadly no... the cartoon should looks like a boy    it's a channel where some guys just telling storied about himself and its always in black and white.         	5
    [Here is the source video for my gif](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zF7Ega_TpZE feature=youtu.be)  There are a few other reactions in there that could be turned into gifs.      You are being downvoted because you have attempted to dismiss everyone who rightly objects to the abhorrent cruelty that pigs are commonly subjected to on contemporary farms by referring to those people as juvenile and attacking their character despite a complete lack of evidence on your part. At the same time you have failed to present any rational justification for your pro-cruelty stance.  There is no brigade, it is just a bad comment.   Instead of resorting to insults you could articulate why you feel your justification was valid.   The train of thought is bad regardless of where it is used. That includes the food question.   Several of the above quotes specifically mention vegan diets as being healthy for all stages of life, and the rest say "(*see context*)" suggesting that you should actually go look at the context for the quote, in which case you would see that the sources are including vegan diets as a type of vegetarian diet in their statements.   These are the largest groups of dietary experts in the world. Some blog source that you saw once on Google of a guy saying he is a recovering vegetarian does not refute that.  Interestingly, what you are doing (rejecting scientific evidence and suggesting that people turn to inferior and unsupported sources) is also a popular strategy used by creationists.

Does [Mercy for Animals](https://www.youtube.com/user/mercyforanimals/videos) count?   It is because there is no singular for the word "cattle" so often the word "cow" is casually used to describe the species even though properly it only refers to females of the species.   I bet you also think killing humans is wrong. Why are you using electricity since air pollution kills people? And what if that paper clip you just dropped causes a hurricane to develop on the other side of the globe that kills people? You should also try talking to mountains about not crushing people in avalanches because that is wrong.  Or you could be a reasonable individual who does what is possible and practical to minimize their impact on others (human and non-human), and recognizes the fact that even though we can't do everything that shouldn't stop us from doing what we can do.      The top response would be:  Found the vegan!   No, you shouldn't forgo evidence because a child says something that contradicts it, but we can recognize that children may not yet have many of our prejudices and can lend a unique way of looking at things.   That is what this post is intended to convey, not that children are actually infallible.

Did you read the article?  Of course, I don't really believe eating meat (or not) has anything to do with masculinity. Gender rules are as limiting for society as national and racial stereotypes. The long term goal is surely to remove attachment to masculinity altogether.

I hate having to shoo these people away and seem like the mean vegan even though it clearly isn't appropriate to just plop themselves down directly in front of our tables.  Along those lines there were some girls at the Houston, Texas show who had brought hula hoops to the event and were doing some artistic/acrobatic hula hoop twirling that for some reason they decided to do right next to our tables. After a couple minutes of this, we pointed out to them that people couldn't come up to the table because they didn't want to interfere with their hula hooping and we asked them to choose another spot for what they were doing.   One of the girls flipped out at this, she walked about 20 feet away, but then turned back and started shouting things like "Hey, I don't see anyone at your table! Nobody wants to go up to you guys anyway!" We mostly ignored her and after a couple minutes she left, but came back later in the day to complain a bit more. It was one of the most immature things I had ever seen.   I first got interest in my club by putting up fliers that had little pull off tabs with my contact info around campus. The school also had a club day where students would go around to tables to find out about on campus clubs. I had a sign up sheet for people to provide us with their e-mail addresses and that's where most interested people signed up.  The core people involved in my club were interested in spreading animal rights, but many more people were only interested in tasty vegan food. I'm not a great cook, but I hosted a lot of vegan potlucks as club events.   My club also did a lot of tabling on campus. I had inherited a lot of stickers that were printed by PETA from a previous animal rights group on campus that had died out a couple years before I started mine. I was also able to make pins/buttons for free using a button maker that the campus had, so we passed these things out for free. If you can't figure out how to get anything like this to pass out for free, you can print stickers super cheap [here](http://www.printrunner.com/cut-to-size-sticker-printing.html) as long as you are printing a large quantity. Passing out a free sticker with a piece of literature can help you reach more people, and anything that you offer for free can bring a lot more people up to your table for a conversation.  Planning a trip to an animal sanctuary, inviting club members to join you for leafleting, holding a movie screening, and [doing a vegan food sampling](http://www.vegfund.org/food-sampling-intro.html) are other good events for on-campus clubs. Assume at first that you will need to be the one taking the initiative to plan these things, but hopefully after a few events you will empower more people to feel comfortable taking the reins on their own.   Thank you!   I think the easiest and one of the more effective ways to engage in activism is leafleting. You can very easily get booklets from [Vegan Outreach](http://veganoutreach.org/order-form/) or [Mercy For Animals](http://store.mercyforanimals.org/details.php?productId=41) that you can pass out at a college campus or local event (I have leafleted at concerts, farmers markets, and a Fourth of July parade).   Other options include getting involved with the [10 Billion Lives Tour](http://www.10billiontour.org/volunteer) or [writing letters to the editor for a local paper](http://www.mercyforanimals.org/action-center#letters). While there are some opportunities to volunteer with larger groups such as [The Humane League](http://www.thehumaneleague.com/get-involved/) I think our movement could really benefit from more people taking the initiative to go out and get involved in something they plan on their own even if it is as simple as leafleting a local college campus.   Finally, don't hesitate to use the internet as a way to reach a lot of people. Online activism, to the extent that it successfully reaches people is just as valuable as similarly effective real-world activism.   Yeah, you were the guy I remembered. It was really nice getting to meet you!   I remember a guy who asked me and one of the daily volunteers what our favorite stickers were who was at the table for a while. There were also a couple other people who took a while to pick out stickers, but I would need to see a picture to remind me of what they looked like.   I don't get paid for any of my activism. I have a full time job working for a company that administers health insurance and pension plans. I'm responsible for reviewing the agreements that come in and setting up our computer system to handle as much of administering the benefits as possible. I also manage a small group of people doing similar work, and I do a lot of work manipulating large amounts of data using Excel (I'm very good at programming Macros in VBA, so the company relies upon me for that).  I know it seems like a lot, but I still have time for normal hobbies too. I play on a soccer team, run/compete in /r/SummerScavengerHunt, and I go hiking most weekends. The nice thing about posting things on reddit is that I can do it while lying on the couch watching Netflix after work.   Yeah, I was at the San Antonio show. Did you see me there?   [This is me](http://i.imgur.com/yeY1gtJ.jpg)   I hadn't seen that picture yet, but I do see a bit of myself hidden in the background there.   The issue of swallowing is a very controversial vegan matter. Personally, I prefer to just let foods gradually slide down my throat instead of swallowing them. :P  As far as activism goes, I think we should try to engage in some activism that pushes us outside of our normal comfort zone. In one of my other comments I described one of our volunteers who was incredibly reluctant to leaflet at first, but after seeing me do it and slowly wading into it herself, she was able to pass out quite a few leaflets.   There are lots of other things that people can do without having to talk to many people face to face though. Action For Animals puts out a lot of their literature in vegan/vegetarian friendly restaurants, and they are often looking for people who will help deliver this literature to local restaurants. Mercy for Animals also recommends writing letters to the editor as something that people can do. [Here is their guide on how to do it](http://www.mercyforanimals.org/action-center#letters). Another thing we can all do is engage in online activism by submitting content to Facebook or reddit, or commenting on reddit threads discussing animal issues.    The admins haven't ever submitted content to /r/vegancirclejerk! Why aren't the admins providing us with more assistance? Firing Victoria is clearly the straw that broke the camel's back, and that doesn't sound very vegan.  If /r/vegancirclejerk goes dark then those admins will finally have to pay attention to us!   I have been using test_subject7471 (with an L) since long before I started using reddit. Back in the late 1990s/early 2000s I was using AIM (AOL instant messenger) quite a bit, and I created several alt usernames for myself on there. One of them included Infinity as part of the username. Over the next couple years I started using similar usernames for other sites and it eventually morphed into the current version. There isn't any particular deeper meaning I have associated with it, it is just the handle I have become accustomed to using on the internet.   If you do a Google search for test_subject7471, only about 20% if the profiles that come up are mine though.   I think /u/squeek502's answer is probably more reassuring than anything I can say. He came out to one of the shows and helped out all day. We distributed a record amount of literature that day (more than Action For Animals had ever gotten out at any single event in the past).   In my experience people are much more receptive to leaflets than anyone would expect. When you walk up to people 65% will take a leaflet and say "thank you", 33% will politely turn you down, 1% will say "I like meat", and 1% will be curious and will ask a couple more questions about the information you're distributing.  I have passed out about 50,000 leaflets throughout all of my activism. Never have I had anyone attack me personally, and for every discouraging comment I have had many more positive ones. My experiences with outreach have always been rewarding overall and left me feeling very good at the end of the day.   test_subject7471 (my username starts with a lower case L). There is another user with the username infinity who I think is starting to get tired of all the username mentions they get that are intended for me.   [I also see comments like these](https://np.reddit.com/r/vegan/comments/3aj2ex/i_just_wanted_to_remind_utest_subject7471_how_much_we/) and it makes me never want to stop.   It is a bit tough when people are degrading or when people simply don't seem to get the point despite all my best efforts, but I try not to take it too personally when people are rude on the internet. Overall, my experiences with animal rights activism have been much more positive than negative.   People were very receptive everywhere we went. I do notice small differences between shows. The people attending the show in Oklahoma City tended to be notably heavier than people in other cities, and Houston had the most people who said "I like meat" and walked off when offered some information. The biggest difference was how hot and humid it got after we left California. Mesa, Arizona was 114 degrees while we were there and Texas and Oklahoma shows were near 100 degrees with very high humidity. It made keeping our energy up a lot harder, but I still did my best to put on a big smile and shout at every kid walking by our table (it is very loud so shouting is the only way to be heard).   Overall though, everywhere we go people tend to be supportive and receptive, and the large majority of our conversations are positive.   I am very much an introvert myself. I would normally avoid big concerts like this because I generally don't enjoy things with large groups of people. That said, I have largely overcome my shyness that I had before going vegan, so I can confidently approach people and start a conversation, even if I wouldn't go to these events for fun.  One of our daily volunteers was terrified of leafleting at first. I asked her to at least come out with me to leaflet the line. At first she hid behind a tree and watched me handing leaflets to people. Then I talked her into stepping out a bit more, and finally got her to hold some leaflets and offer them to the people next to the people I had already approached and handed leaflets to. Within an hour or so she was walking up to people more or less on her own and handing them leaflets.   [Vegan Outreach](http://veganoutreach.org/contact/) does a lot of leafleting at events and college campuses. If you contact them, they will be happy to let you know when an experienced leafleter will be in your area and how you can get involved with helping them.   [Mercy for Animals](http://www.mercyforanimals.org/get-involved) has several ideas for ways people can get involved on their website. Another easy way to get involved is with [FARM's 10 Billion Lives Tour](http://www.10billiontour.org/volunteer) (paying people to watch a 4 minute video on factory farming).   In addition to real world activism, we can all share things online that can reach huge numbers of people with a pro-animal rights message. [Here is a resource where you can quickly see where people are mentioning the word "vegan" on reddit](http://metareddit.com/monitor/PGfXV/vegan/). You can also find content that helps promote animal rights and help submit it to other subreddits.   You are correct. I spent 5 weeks volunteering at Warped Tour a couple years ago, and I have passed out 20,000 booklets with Vegan Outreach too. My first activism experiences were back when I was running an animal rights club in college.   I see an important role for both within the animal rights movement. People are more charitable when talking to someone face to face that they can see and identify with. We can pick up on social cues that may not be available online and better tailor our responses to people.  Online we have the advantage of being able to cite sources, and have our comments or posts seen by a much wider audience. [Here is a link that I posted the day I left on my trip](http://imgur.com/nsFUwJ1). It has been viewed 3.1 million times. I could never reach that many people in person, but online I have been able to post share several items a month that get over a million views. These images can't replace a full conversation with someone, but they have absolutely succeeded in starting many conversations and giving many people a slight nudge in the direction of veganism.   If I was choosing which area I think we can make a larger impact with the same amount of effort, I would say online activism, if done well, is a better use of most people's efforts at this time.   A lot of people came up to the table saying they were interested in going vegan and asked us for tips on how to do that. So, by being there I think there is a good chance that we got them to take the final leap, but I hardly count that as a conversion.   When we got people to approach the table I would generally start by asking them if they were vegan, vegetarian, or just interested (I phrased it this way because it seems like I am giving them a choice, but no matter what they answer it sounds like they are on the side of cutting back on animal products). If people said "just interested" I would encourage them to give up more animal products and consider going vegetarian. If they said they were vegetarian then I would push them toward veganism by saying something like.  Have you ever considered moving toward veganism? I'm sure you're aware that the conditions for egg laying hens and dairy cows are every bit as terrible as for animals raised for meat. I totally get that going vegan can seem daunting, I was very hesitant myself to make the switch at first. It means cutting out all these foods from your diet, and you don't know what is going to replace them yet. I've been vegan for seven years and now I just go to the supermarket like anyone else and pick up the foods I like, as anyone else would, but when I was first making the change it was definitely more difficult.   One thing we recommend to people is to consider committing to cutting out all animal products from your diet 1-2 days a week. That way you can start finding new foods and alternatives that you enjoy and from there it becomes much easier to do 3,4,5 days a week after that!  The conversation varied a bit from person to person (they would usually give some of their own feedback in between my comments). I think the approach I used was very effective (I could tell people responded very positively to it), but because I didn't ever say to go outright vegan right away I didn't hear many people say they were going to do that.    It isn't PETA that you are harming. It is the birds who are being harmed.   [Here are some pictures showing what our outreach looked like at a typical show](http://imgur.com/a/Cqay4). We also leafleted the line every morning before each show. On a typical day we distributed 3,000-5,000 pieces of literature, engaged in a couple hundred conversations, and raised between $800 and $2,000 for the non-profit Action for Animals. Several other redditors came for a day to help volunteer with us (I'll let them decide if they want to expose themselves). I had a lot of people tell me that they went vegetarian or vegan from something they had heard/read/seen at a prior year's Warped Tour show.   One thing I noticed is that for many of our volunteers this was their first time engaging in any activism. They all did a great job, and their talents, if applied effectively, could spare the lives of hundreds of thousands even millions of animals. If you have any questions about getting involved in animal rights activism, please ask!  I'm happy to answer any other questions you have too. AMA!                                                                                 One of the top redditors (1,000,000 karma) who mods some of the default subs said this in /r/centuryclub:  We don't know the details of her removal, and frankly, shouldn't. Encouraging tamper tantrums by blacking out subreddits is tantamount to the tamper tantrum the users threw when FPH occurred.   /u/chooter was incredible in every instance of my interactions with her, but that still doesn't mean I should know why she was let go from her position or that I should make a hissy fit about something I don't know anything about.  I do believe the reddit staff handled the timing poorly, but that doesn't change the sentiment in any way.  Reddit is a community that we all enjoy. By tanking this site we are also losing out.  The people who run reddit (admins) do have some responsibilities to the community, but reddit is a site designed to make it up to us as users to provide the content that we enjoy, independent of assistance from the admins.   I can see the value in some protest to voice the concerns of the community, but by now those concerns have been heard. The admins undoubtedly think this is very serious. It is time to open up subreddits again so that the protest doesn't unnecessarily continue to inconvenience us (the users).      We all lose out on this community that we enjoy.   Ultimately ethical veganism is a boycott intended to lessen the demand for animal products. Other animals do not possess all of the capacities that a typical human would have, but they show responses that appear quite similar to our own reactions to suffering when treated in many of the ways that would cause us to suffer.  [Utilitarianism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utilitarianism) is a common school of ethical thought amongst vegans. Utilitarians view an action as good if it maximizes the amount of goodness (generally judged as increasing pleasure or happiness, and minimizing pain or suffering) that is expected to occur as a result. While many ethical vegans will openly admit that they enjoy the taste of meat (evidenced by the numerous meat alternatives available for vegans today), they recognize that the harm caused to other animals to produce these products almost certainly exceeds the pleasure they gain as a result. The boycott that is veganism lessens demand for these products, and correspondingly supply will decrease as a result.  Another way of expressing this is in the principle of [equal consideration of interests](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equal_consideration_of_interests). That is to say that the interest of any individual should be given equal consideration where, and to the extent that the interest exists. This isn't to say that all interests are equal, experienced equally, or that all animals possess interests, but that where there are interests, we should weight that interest proportionally to the intensity of the interest and not discriminate on any other basis.   [Here is my answer from another thread that applies pretty well to your question](https://np.reddit.com/r/vegan/comments/39u2s7/vegetarian_here_trying_to_understand_the_logic/cs6gi0o).     	192
 Interesting. Should there be an activator or some sort of device to control who's in charge, like the Firestorm Matrix?   I like the idea of Firestorm, but I'm not sure how I could make the two be separate beings combined into one when one is a basically a god. I like the idea for Ziz being really fuzzy on terms of mortality and Eli beginning to lose it when Ziz starts to get to him. I could see Ziz hijacking Eli's body to try human things like eat ice cream or something.   He can fly at supersonic speeds, sonic screech, enhanced reflexes, strength and senses. Later on, with Ziz actually in control of Eli's body, they can pull off bigger feats like generating a massive hurricane, becoming a massive Gryphon that blots out the sun and being powerful enough to punch out other beings of similar power.    Hey Redditors,  I've been working on a science fiction series set in a universe where humanity has left Earth to colonize other planets run by Mega Corperations. To make a long story short, the central character, Eli,  gets the soul of Ziz, the primordial monster of the sky, infused with his, linking them. Now I plan for Eli to be able to use Ziz's powers to fight various villians and stuff, but that's not the problem. I was wondering how I could work the two characters being in one body. Any suggestions?    Hey Redditors, What is death like or viewed in your world? What about ceremonies or funerals?   I imagine it would be barely hidden evil when they're around. Like someone struggling to remain human long enough to get things done before leaving to their home dimension. I don't want it to be like Wolf Ram and Hart from Angel. However, since it's a cyberpunk world, I might be able to spin it to make it something unique.    Drama/horror. The protagonist is trying to find out what it was that killed his parents and trying to stop the rise of the Fair Folk, who are depicted as a creepily organized corporation who is funded by a Lovecraftian horror.    The protagonist doesn't randomly have the ability to see the supernatural, he's always had this ability. There's an entire pseudo army of people with this ability who act as a form of law enforcement in the supernatural world. He's dodging them because the fact that he was raised by werewolves is illegal. By law, he should've been given over to the human authorities, but the werewolves took him in.   I like the idea of luck being spent, but it should run out over time and be unreliable to a degree. Luck can only get you so far before it runs out.   Most crime syndicates in-universe are run by major monsters, like a group of hit-men being run by Minotaurs or a drug kingpin being ran by a goblin. They generally don't like each other, hence turf-wars. Vampires and other 'higher' creatures run Megacorperations to fund their particular eating habits.   When it comes to magic, monsters know about it and use it for utility reasons, while some humans know and use it for various reasons. The thing is, there is ALWAYS a price with magic. The protagonist has the power to see the supernatural for example, but he has really bad luck to compensate for that. His human friend in high school used magic to cure her mother of cancer, but the spell killed her father as payment. The general rule is, 'magic will, at the end of the day, bend you over and fuck you in the ass.'       The protagonist isn't a werewolf or anything remotly supernatural. He's just a normal human who was adopted and raised by werewolves and can see the paranormal.      Basicly, the monsters and creatures wear special jewelry that puts them in human form. Like a dragon wears a pin that makes him human or a gorgon wears a necklace that makes her monstrous attribues less noticeable. It's basically a glamour.      Hey Redditors,  I'm thinking about working on an urban fantasy series this summer, to get some ideas off my chest. The plot is about a college Freshman who discovers that he can see the supernatural around him. He's like a 'muggle best friend' of a werewolf and ghost, who go out and battle monsters in human form. It's still in the rough stages, but this is where y'all come in. You guys can throw out ideas and suggestions for the series.   Edit- Sorry, I was going through my notes and the protagonist is going to become the next Grim Reaper, sorry I missed that.   Great power for a villain or anti hero. I could see the user blitzing around, faster than the eye could register, taking out rooms of guards, pummling people into submission or killing an entire town with horrifying procession. I think a weakness would be if you managed to drug the person, so that their power wouldn't work quite right and they'd mess up.   Do you mean like duplicates or two minds merged into one body, a la Firestorm?    I already have a sci fi world with elemental and non-traditional element control as a basis for the world, I'm trying to stay away from elemental powers as much as I can. But interesting ideas!   It depends. Often times the individual is born with their power active, but other times, like with Bren, it has to be activated through times of stress, like Metahumans in DC comics.    Bren has no powers at first as it seems. He's the child of a male Wulder and a powered woman (prostitute), but later on, he discovers that his power is to transform into a giant bear-like creature.        I think it's a mix of a Rank system and a Effect based system. The aforementioned Rat-Man's power would be able to counter almost any power depending on how he used it. But against some powers, by the virtue of being more powerful, like telekinesis or pyrokenesis would be able to kick his butt or kill him.      At the lowest level, the powers consist of simple powers like talking to plants or small animals. Middle level powers would be something like optic blasts, cryokinesis, invisibility ect. High level and dangerous powers would be a speedy healing factor, vibration emissions, superhuman strength, invulnerability, super speed, reality warping and teleportation. Most people would be fighting on level one or two as level threes would either be in hiding or arrested for the safety of others.    Hey Redditors,   I've begun working on a story set in a fantasy world where magic and magical creatures have been (explosively) introduced in a wave of altering particles. Some people begin to develop magic abilities in a manner similar to superpowers in the wake of this explosion and the influx of creatures means that monster slaying has become a profession. (edit) Before the explosion, there were some people with the ability to transform into an animal at will. This ability isn't magical in nature, and no one really knows how people can do this. The shape shifters (known as 'Wulders' by normal people) are now in direct competion as heroes and adventurers as Powered people begin to rise.     Hey Redditors, Fall semester ended with me failing my History class. Mom wasn't too happy and said that if I failed another class, school wouldn't be an option for me anymore. I'm a decent writer, so with time I could support myself, but I just need some help with how to break it to her that I failed my Government Course this semester, and on what I can do next.    I have a goof amount of things taken from other works and applied to new stories and places.  -Pantaria is heavily inspired by my year playing WOW, Dungeons and Dragons with the adventurer's being a important faction in the world. The humor, fantasy races, weird Mageocracy and comedic sociopathy of various characters was inspired by the late Terry Prachett.   Faria- Faria was designed in a manner similar to Xanth, where people are born with either a power or are shapeshifter's limited to one animal form. The entire concept of social status based on powers are from The Inhuman's of Marvel Comics.   The newest unnamed world where magic is suddenly released into a fantasy world is similar to CW's Flash, with the particle accelerator. The Shieldmen are like a mix of S.H.I.E.L.D and Night's Watch, but instead of containing anomalites, they slay them and get orphans to act as squires and eventually rise to the status of Shieldmen.      And now a word from our sponsor.   Tired of having your kids nag and whine every summer? Do their demands for ice cream and video games wear your to the bone? Ever wish a group of faceless, hooded figures would come along and drag them off to a unknown dimension full of other children they've captured? Did you say yes? Did you? Even if you didn't, take your little meatlings down to (static comes over the radio) Park!   At (static) Park, you'll find all of the fun games and rides that all children enjoy! We've got roller coasters, Tilt-a-Whirls and puppet shows with 50 percent less blood.  The Endless Corridor seems to be a hit with all of our older visitors and we've opened a petting zoo! That's right, all of the cute little goats, geese, Shoggoth's and other slimy primordial horrors from other dimensions are here, for a limited time only!   So bring your kids! Just follow that dull, aching drone in the base of your neck that all humans have heard from the beginning of time, but only now have begun to investigate. The Park is outside of your hometown, wherever that may be. Go there and experience some merriment in your tiny, insignificant lives before they pass into the void of time and space. Kids and adults get in half price on the weekends!     Like a sonic caw?   It was my anxiety. It's been getting bad, but this semester it was really bad. I studied, but I was so worried that I would fail and have to forfit my dream of being a teacher that it became harder and harder to keep focused. I also didn't speak up when my parents suggested that I take a math course alongside a Government course. The stress from the Math class effected my ability to do well in the other course.    I was going for a degree in English, but now I won't have any support in terms of school.   But you wound up with thorn skin and future-vision.       So you'd be a double robot?   Hey Redditors,  I just finished Agents of Shield season 2, and just wondered, what would people most likely get after undergoing the transformation? No powers are off limits!  (edit- to make this more fun, you must get some sort of deformity or odd trait)   So you can never have sex without giving your partner cancer?    Self explanatory.    Hey fellow Washers of Dishes! Just for fun, anyone want to discuss how they got into this illustrious field and where they hope to go in the future?   Here's a tip- Monster Energy Drinks and some smooth jazz.   	33
 Dispensaries, sex shops, smoke shops, hookah bars    That's awesome!!! :) I'd be interested in the link to your shop!    These look like something you would get from Omerica Organic...Did you customize or actually make them out of wood? Just curious! If you made them they're really gorgeous high quality work and I'm impressed.    Your hair looks like cotton candy miss! And I like it! :)   Good places to eat/sight see around the Monaco hotel downtown? I'm not 21 and I'm a tourist...Help please! I'm pretty sad I can't drink or 'anything ;)' while I'm here...   This ^,  and if you like double flares and not the hassle of getting them in I'd recommend trying different materials like silicone and getting df plugs in any other material that have less of a flare... Some can certainly have even more than a mm flare and even that much at 2g would be near impossible... For anyone with tight skin.   Not electronic but Neko Case!      Toilet paper, wood, cigarettes, prescription medications, money, credit cards...The list goes on and it is debatable which would cause more uproar.   Que the riot scene about this very thing from Wentworth, am I right? I guess this comment is more for people who watch the show but yeah...This scenario in a prison setting.   Well, when a female porn star has her period yeah. She would want to stay home and watch Ellen(or Netflix) with chocolate...They're people too. Porn would get tiring.    That we all say eh, know everyone else in our country, and live in igloos...Don't even need to guess do you?  Because they're all super untrue and they annoy me...   I have some pretty good ones: side/rib tattoo for 4.5 hours, laparoscopy surgery, and living with endo for years.    Blue Oyster Cult - Don't fear the reaper...https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUO_5EALZoM  I know its cliche   What I like:  * My long eyelashes * My slightly ginger hair * Tattoos * stretched ears * My bum * My boobs * In love with my micro dermals, in the tragus area  What I don't like:  * My stomach I have flab and I used to be fit and flat stomached while eating whatever I wanted * Teeth, front two are crooked * Brows, on the thin side and light because part ginger * Height and weight, 5'1 and 137 lbs * Stretch marks * Scars * I have a really short tongue, I can barely stick it out * Skin - pale and eczema * Fine bone straight hair - I want dreads so......   I think if you added a few more stars to the bottom it would make it more American but I'm a Canadian so what do I know :P   Wow, this is a whole other level of stupidity all of its own. I can't even believe someone could be that dumb and ignorant over 5 damn cents!       This is really different than anything else LOG I've ever heard especially at the beginning but I still really enjoy it!    Even using a leave in spray conditioner should solve this issue as well as brushing more regularly...Also, any shampoo with lots of chemicals(so drugstore or even professional stuff) makes my hair smoother, straighter, and even thinner so I'd say that and leave in...   Also maybe consider how much you're washing your hair and adjust if its less than every day or every other day!  	20
 "I do not content to searches or seizures. I do not answer any questions."   Also recording the police in public is not a crime, and since it is not a crime you cannot be detained for it.  Cops are legally allowed to lie to you so be prepared for bullshit about "officer saftey" and "We need to check your Id because we don't know who you are."  Read up on your rights and your right to record.    This happens.   http://photographyisnotacrime.com/2013/03/nebraska-police-chase-down-man-video-recording-their-abuse-while-second-man-video-records-it-all/   Someone better check the breaks on his chair. Coz that nigga is outta control.    Bambuster works, also the ACLU just released an app that does just that.   For my fellow Americans. Your Rights.   My thought is that they are going to try every loophole they can. In the end it doesn't matter if the arrest was legal or not. Those fucking cops killed that man.   No. I prefer to be called,   Capt Penis Weenis, high lord and master of all things involving pluggn dat puss. Terror of hymens and cervix world wide. The commander of CLIT (Cause of Ladies Intense Tremors).       She is a fat tumblrina SJW. You will find no logic here.    So you are saying you receive no compensation for your moderation. Not even a hot pocket?   I bet the jews did this.   All the more reason to know your rights and to always record the police. Even if your not involved always record.   Draw a picture of Muhammad = Death.  Marry and fuck a 9 year old = Accepted.   Religion not even once.   Your right I messed up when I posted it. (I blame the booze).      Take a seed.

Local militia made of members of the community, selected by the members of that community. Trained in use of non-lethal and lethal take downs. And must know every word of the Bill of Rights/Constitution.  Remove all restrictions on gun ownership (unless someone has been convicted of using a gun in a crime).  Civilian over-site of all police nationwide.  End of Police Unions.  End the war on drugs.   And yes it sounds extreme and crazy but take a look at the country we live in now and tell me we are better off than what im suggesting.    thank you.

"Marijuana turns people into godless heathens who are gay and have armys of stoned killer rabbits."   Can't tell if shill for fox/police or just retarded.

Watched it and countless other videos like this. It fucked. This happens every day. Seriously go to /r/bad_cop_no_donut and /r/amifreetogo. Get involved in recording the police and knowing your rights. With enough of the public watching the watchers, the knowledge of it will get to the cops and hopefully make them think twice about being fuck heads.  Also if anyone shot my dog I would shoot them right in the face.    Holy shit microsoft get it together. How could you add 12 years to Liam.     Meth.   Not even once.   Mods please add a trigger warning. You know what I mean?   The war on drugs is fucking outdated and harmful to everyone involved.   It is a felony to put a seed in dirt and grow it into a plant that in all of recored history has never killed anyone. But it is perfectly legal to set up a micro brewery and make booze which kills 100,000+ yearly.   The drug laws in this country are completely idiotic and counter productive to a free society.   I am completely agenst anyone being jailed for anything involving marijuana, makes no difference if that person is a cop or not.    All the more reason to record any and all interaction with the police. Even if you are not involved, stand back, dont interfere and record. That way when the police claim "camera malfunction" or the video "disappeared" you have proof of whatever it is they are hiding.  Also I see this going straight to the supreme court. The public has every right to see what public servants do in public.    Zoe is (by her own definition) a rapist. She is also a manipulative pathological liar who can't make a good game to save her life. She is not important to anyone other than her fellow kool-aid drinking cronys.

Fuck her and her lies and fuck all the people who support her.   /rant   As someone who did a good bit of charlie years ago, I believe I know the how for the third picture.  Seems to me like someone was trying to bang some H, and after they were done they drew up some blood and shot it at the wall from left to right.   Or after they drew up the blood the needle got clogged. So they pushed the plunger hard to unclog it. Which would explain the spray pattern at one end and the line going away from it     Checks out, thank you for the reply, my mom would thank you too but she is still freaked out.   You maybe right, it has been over 10 years since I was in high school.         Single dads unite. Also you pretty much nailed it.   Doesn't matter if its your first offense or not they are gonna charge ya, the first offense part will only matter to the judge.   They could press tons of shit on you but chances are its not gonna be to serious.   You were selling drugs on school property. There will be charges.   Its not up to the cop its up to the judge. Cops lie and are legally allowed to do so.  Your pretty much fucked, its not that big of a deal tho, just thow yourself at the mercy of the judge and be prepared to have to give up smoking for a bit.   And beat that snitches ass.    Gonna be that guy because someone has to.  You are a fucking idiot.  Now that that's outta the way.  Never admit anything ever, and fucking most definitely do not give someone evidence of you commiting a crime. Like holy shit I get your a rich kid in California but have some sense.   Secondly you beat that snitches ass. No discussion no nothing, walk up beat that ass.  Third selling bud on school grounds is a big fucking no. Yes its cali but that shit is still illegal and you will have to do some type of probation/diversion program. Something like some drug classes and piss tests for a few months. Could be more could be less.  As far as the school goes its on them if they kick you out or not. Cant say what will happen there.  If the cops show up and try to talk to you, you shut up. The only words you say are "I don't answer questions and I don't consent to searches or seasures." That's it nothing else. If they ask for your phone you say this and only this "Do you have a search warrant?" Chances are they will not but will lie and pull some shit to try and get it. Unless you see a warrant singned by a judge you give them nothing.   Good luck, learn from this experience, read up on your rights (since you seem to not know them), never sell shit on school grounds,  and the biggest advice I have for you is don't be such a idiot.

I believe that most cops don't but most cops don't know that's what they are being prepared for.  You give a department military grade equipment and tell them that they are fighting a war on terror or drugs and the effect is obvious.     The tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time with the blood of patriots and tyrants.   Suddenly I have a huge craving for baby back ribs.

    If a phone is that cheap, your information is being used to subsidize the rest.    For me- nutmeg. A whole teaspoon of it..         Thank you!   Thanks :)      lol! Well played Sir. Well played.   Did you say 168mm not 16.8mm?!? Jesus. That's like apocalypse shit right there. Holy crap, can confirm. That's insane.   Always relevant for an upvote.   **I GOT A JOB!** Handing in resignation today.   No.. There's a lot of misinformation around, would love to hear some truth about whether it's going to snow!          I'm pointing it out as not impeding traffic is synonymous with keeping as left as possible.   And again as a rider, it's good practise to keep left as you don't often hear drivers coming up behind you until it's too late..      Indeed. Then I'm sure his aggressive attitude would have shown through when talking to the police man, his words ring with spite towards the officer who stopped him, so I honestly wouldn't be surprised if a "quick word with the cyclist asking him to be more courteous" escalated to the ticket by the cyclist blaming them for being asian!    Ok, so it's let break down his video.  For starters, he's not obeying the law of "keep left" in his own video evidence, at 00:26 he was firmly on the road, when there was the opportunity to ride on the left.  Then his commentary itself reeks of arrogances, let's have a look at his language:  * He said: "They missed a couple of opportunities to "quickly" navigate pass me"   * For those who don't know the road, it's a very windy, very dangerous road. You have as little as 50cm either side of the white line before you either hit the cliff, or your wheels drop into a 30-90ft drop. You don't "quickly" nip past someone, unless you know the road really well.  * He said: "They **had** to follow me along the next straight"  * This could easily be construed as "I did not let them pass." Better wording to help his cause would have been: "there were no opportunities for them to pass." we don't know why they "had" to stay behind him, but that sentence by itself doesn't sound very good in this context.  * He then goes on to say as they passed him: "Quite hesitatant, quite slow".."Looked sideways, international tourists"..  * I cycled for a long time, if you have someone up your ass, you look behind you, **is he honestly telling us this is the first time he actually looked the van?** After all this time, he never actually looked behind him to see if he was holding up traffic, or how close they were? That's appalling driving full stop, you should ways look behind you!  * Furthermore, this actually **completely** explains their hesitance, they were unfamiliar with the road, they were probably stressed by a growing row of cars behind them, and this guy wasn't budging an inch to let them pass.  All in all, this guy's coming across like a totally arrogant sod, and he did not do himself any good by going to the Press about it. At the very least he should have thought very carefully about what he was going to say, and not used any of the words, or examples he gave as I've proven any reasonable person can rip them apart and make him sound like he's the bad guy!        He's checking facebook and texting during getting dressed?   I hate you. Have an upvote...   Woah, one of my more controversial comments.   * Is it a stupidly implemented plan? Fuck yes. * Was the news article deliberately worded to illicit maximum racism triggers? Oh you bet your click bait it was. * Does it help people who need help? Well.. Yes, it does. For **that and that alone** it's a great idea. * Is it racist? [According to the dictionary](http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/racism) it most certainly is a clear cut racist policy: "a policy, system of government, etc., based upon or fostering such a doctrine; discrimination." * Does it help anyone? No. Ultimately now the cat's out of the bag, I really wouldn't want to be a policeman today! I can image a lot this today: "Oh you're just giving me a ticket cause I'm white?! Fuck you cunt! I read the news about you racist pricks not ticketing Maori! I'm not paying this."    Hmm. That's a disturbing thought...   At first glance, racist! Then I realise it's a really sad reflection on what must be a serious issue of people who probably simply can't afford to keep their car running, but need a car for work, children etc.   Maori are proud kiwis, and no-one likes to ask for help, until it's too late. Honestly this is great, it puts those at in financial stress at the doorstep of those who can help.    For the record school uniforms make up a fantastic wee profitable side business.  The school puts out a tender for the lowest bidder to offer their services to design/make/sell the school uniform. The school then takes the cheapest tender, while basically being able to make their own price, and their profit.  They then take a cut of all the sales of said uniforms, while holding it above the students heads that they must wear a uniform.  It's a fucking monopolistic racket.  If you're interest [this is worth a read.](http://www.theguardian.com/education/2011/jan/18/school-uniform-results) It basically confirms "After eight years, Brunsma concluded that: "The results, although surprising to many, simply cannot be ignored. Uniforms do not make our schools better."  So I'm loving all the self righteous "The point of a uniform is to ensure there's equality with the students" comments. Bah! No uniforms are a source of massive profit for schools, and they want to keep it that way!      Further to this - if you don't want to go through the hassle of configuring a new email, you can [use an alias email!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email_alias)   A lot of email companies (ISP's etc) allow you to configure an alias email  to be sent to primary email account. Think of it like a mask for your true address.  For instance, say I have an email: "teherbil@fakecompany.net" I approach Fakecompany, and ask them to configure a more profressional sounding alias: "joe.bloggs@fakecompany.net" for my test_subject752 account.  Moving forward, you can put "joe.bloggs@fakecompany.net" in your CV etc, and when your **receive** email it goes to your test_subject752 account.  You can also configure Outlook and using the companies own email interface to **send** from that email account as well, with the reply coming back to test_subject752.   Or worst still a map I saw recently which was basically...   Blue for currently supplied.  Cyan for next ETA within 3 months.  Indigo for ETA within next 3-6 months.  Purple for 6-12 months.   Yeah, decipher than bitch.      No, that's not what I'm saying at all, both of those news agencies are bound by political views of the benefactors. They simply have to tread lightly for fear of eliciting your exact response.   It's not like they're morally or financially obligated to accurately portray an unbiased or unfiltered view of the news, that's silly talk.      The very interesting there here is the SFO actually [investigated last year](http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/10140332/Kohanga-Reo-wants-apology-after-no-fraud-found) and "Serious Fraud Office inquiry cleared its commercial arm of misspending."  So either the SFO didn't do a good enough job, or the powers that be hid this very well.  Either way, this is going to be a powder keg I doubt Stuff or NZherald are going to reach touch upon properly. As OP mentions below, RadioLive refused to properly report upon it.   Nice!   the frustrating thing is he'll be haemorrhaging cash with his dirty practices, a sustainable farm that reinvests effluent back into the land, can (after an initial small investment) provide a significant return. But too many farmers (at least when a few years back) are way too ignorant and set in their ways to change.  The sad thing is our environment can't keep up with the current rate of pollution from dairy farming, I was chatting to the guys who run the Waitaki/Ohau canal and dam system. Basically they've been working on the system for 20 years + and it's incredibly disheartening for them recently as the levels of the nitrates in the soil has lead to a significant impact on the quality of the water running through the system.   It's so bad the colour of the water itself, which used to be a beautiful pale blue color, straight off the main divide is slowly turning brown as it's choked with pollution and weeds which thrive in the nitrogen rich water.  It's got to stop, or at least change significantly, as something has to give.   It's not just the farmers future at stake, it's our childrens.      My sister in WLG might be able to help, she works in a nice wee cafe in the WLG botanical gardens.   Pm me if you're interested and I'll hit her up.  As an aside WLG has awesome public transport, but defo worth taking a trip basically *anywhere*.  As for safety, **don't be bloody stupid and you'll be fine.** Watch your drinks at the bar, put a pin and register your i-device etc with either "find my iPhone" Or "find my mobile" (Samsung and Apple) both have anti-theft features built in but you need to enable them!   From what I understand Steven Spielberg was like a masterful artist playing your fears against you, I found the less you saw of them, the scarier the dinosaurs were.  This movie however leans more towards visual impact without the background element of terror. Don't get me wrong it does a fantastic job!   I couldn't agree more there's a reason that original movie still makes you crap yourself..   It's pretty epic. I honestly think there's no human in the world that isn't in some way, shape or form that's curious about dinosaurs, and seeing them come alive almost illicit a child like sense of amazement in even the hardest skeptics!   That's about right ay.  Check with your Energy Provider, if you have a smart meter you may be able to get an hourly blow by blow of when the Energy's being used.

Yes, 9mo came off breast by himself after a cold around 7 1/2 months and was already on part solids (watties etc.) so transition him quickly to formula and solids.

Once he could grasp he really enjoyed picking up the food, and it's helped his dexterity immensely.      Seriously? A pedestrian crossing is one of the few bastions of pedestrian safety mechanisms that provides the benefit to people to allow them to cross the road safetly, and gives people the right of way.

The reason being is simple, we couldn't afford it if someone hit us, the insurance sided with them and charged our card. Not likely I know but the extra price was just factored into the car hire budget.  The other benefit I didn't foresee was the car company didn't check the car before we bought it (just off a flight with a 9mo so great to get him to my relatives asap!)   And likewise when we returned the car, they didn't need to check it, so we didn't need to assign an unknown period of time to have them check the car for damage. (Again tired, shitty sick 9mo!)   Chch, 9mo boy   Seriously?  He was protecting his family, he didn't go out of his way to aggravate him.   He didn't pull the fingers or yell obscenities at the guy, he "*motioned for him to slow down*" this guy was just looking out for his family!   Indeed. Iirc he made multiple attempts as turning around, and taking aim a few times.  Then again, he was drunk, and the courts seem to [smile fondly upon drunk drivers killing people](http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/crime/10232597/Drunk-driver-avoids-jail). /s      Actually, a million times this.

It used to be customer satisfaction = good profit.  Now it's Good profit = investor happiness whatever the cost to customers.   Ah I see. Yes, I agree it's click-bait, but they have a point, and one that few other news places are willing to touch..   It does seem like the price of things are kept off main stream media, for instance Australia called the big companies and gave them a very public blasting for the ridiculous mark up on the price of software and other multinational products, while our media stayed silent on the matter.   Again, (putting on tin foil hat) the NZ public have been subliminally trained to shut up and put up with whatever prices companies want to shove down our throats.   Not trolling, they have a good point. Here's a few recent issues with greed in NZ society:  * The Comcom decision to allow Chorus to charge a stupid amount of money in total disregard for the fact that Chorus have been overcharging consumers for years!  * Air New Zealand and others not decreasing the price of the airfare despite Oil prices dropping signifcantly (and fuel prices as a result) and subsequently the entire Airline industry is in for a record $29.9 BILLION dollar profit!  * Online payment "convenience fees" cropping up when paying online. (E.G. Vodafone when paying your phone bill via their Application)  * Beer prices in most cafe's and bars being $7.50+ at the cheap scale, at $12 for a single Corona etc. (they're $2 from the supermarket.) and then they complain people pre-drink..  * Schools forcing parents to buy clothes/stationery from 1 retailer, usually at a stupendous mark up, of which the school then gets a cut from.  * Most retailers charging a ridiculous mark up for supporters merchandise. (E.g. the Adidas debacle over the All Black shirt that could be bought for *hundreds* less overseas.  * Kiwi meat prices, we're charged more at our supermarkets than the meat is subsequently for sale for overseas.  Fuck, what else really? We have had the wool pulled over our eyes for many years that "buy kiwi" was best, but in reality we are being groomed to pay the ticket price, never haggle, and don't question status quo.   As a result, greed has crept into the equation and subsequently the prices have risen steadily out of line with the cost of supply and selling and 99% of the time this profit has been driven back to the shareholders/bosses while the man actually doing the work gets minimum wage and told to shut up and accept it.   /rant.      It looks like my life cause I did!   Hmm, tempted!    Fuck yes, a bit ashamed he wasn't the the first to mind!    Honorary kiwi?    Like David Fucking Chopper Fucking Read?   I don't know if it's the same in the states as it here over here in NZ, but to be a licensed medication practitioner you need to attend a shit ton of courses and lectures in order to keep your knowledge completely up to date and in order to keep your license.  People who fail to comply can lose their license etc.   So long as they keep their knowledge up to date and pass the necessary exams, why should they leave?          It's arguable it's *who you know* rather what *what you know* in **some industries** like IT for sure.   I have a career with a multinational company I love without a degree working in IT.   Wow. Such a range of frequencies and sounds from 1 instrument is incredible, you really know how to make that guitar purr.   And never make the mistake of pissing off the fire pixies! They'll burn your house down.   That damn mountain spirit ay!   ...And posted on /r/nottheonion/! This is absurd.      Oh yes me too, perhaps a not too hot plot. Don't want to burn those marshmallows!      Royal Opera, also dolphin, both have always on desktop modes.   Dolphin also supports flash, if your into that kind of thing :-P   But it's never the rich paying for anything, their smart enough to use the loopholes provided by the government's they voted in, like trusts etc.   It's the working middle class like me (earning just above "average" wage) as the sole bread winner for my family, as I said I pay tax due to not earning enough to either hide, or to bother with hiding.   I can't get any benefits as it stands, and as you said the increase in retirement age which is going to happen (and they are bumping the superannuation up more than any other benefit) will mean I, and peers my age will be paying even more tax before we can claim anything that's not mean tested, and that's even *if* the superannuation is around by then!   Hence why "charge the rich" is joke! Direct from Google..  **New Zealand went through a major program of tax reform in the 1980s. The top marginal rate of income tax was reduced from 66% to 33% (changed to 39% in April 2000, 38% in April 2009 and 33% on 1 October 2010) and corporate income tax rate from 48% to 33% (changed to 30% in 2008 and to 28% on 1 October 2010).**  So there's your charge the rich, our government's have no interest in doing so, because the rich because put people in government.   Apt name there buddy.    It has huge benefits, in the states legalising marijuana has bandaged to anecdotally drop crime rates, while providing millions to the local coffers..  www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/07/17/marijuana-crime-denver_n_5595742.html   Indeed. Look here, provides the scary bell curve statistics for the ageing population with the future plotted too, didn't provide a pretty picture, the older generation are going to have a population boom soon.  Link: http://www.stats.govt.nz/populationpyramid2/NZPopulationPyramid.html   But the thing is it's not sustainable in any way, telling me that the rate of increases to the superannuation when at this rate we'll need to raise the retirement age to 70 in the next couple years is going to help anyone before the age of 50 is a slap in the face.   For instance due to the income restrictions they place upon any benefits I can get put me out of range despite being on a single income family, with a young baby. We have to dip into savings each month to live. So despite the fact I'm been paying my fair share of taxes which go towards these benefits I can't claim any of them despite needing to. Old people however, some of whom I'm certain never paid taxes due to fantastic accountants are sitting there with taxpayers money rolling in each month without fail. What.The.Fuck?   Now you look me in the eye and tell me that if they applied same income testing against super that they would still have to keep the came cap on the other benefits? I believe they would have significantly more money in the pot to allow more members of society access to benefits, like myself.    I'm discriminated against due to my age. My wife and son are discriminated against by having an age based restriction placed against me (and them) as to what benefits we can claim, then further restricting these benefits based upon my income!   Further more, the bell graph for nz aging population speaks volumes about the future of the New Zealand's increase in the amount of aged people: http://www.stats.govt.nz/populationpyramid2/NZPopulationPyramid.html  Basically as is clearly visible the amount of old people is set to rise dramatically in the coming years.   If the current economists are warning that *just* our current superannuation is not able to be sustained, especially at the way national this will become even worse!   And they are were? ...

Thank you for correcting me good sir.   That is news to me indeed. Or do you mean the new law?    Thank you for pointing that out.   I read news from a variety of sources and completely understand I am fed some bullshit from time to time, and I make the mistake of repeating them without checking them, for which I can only apologize for, however I would appreciate being corrected rather than just being told I'm wrong.    I'm not comparing us to other countries, relatively speaking we have had it good. However recently (past few years) it's just gone downhill.    We've got as government that's spending ludicrous amounts of money on a flag referendum, which had no public support at all.  We've got a public service for unemployed that treat their customers like pieces if shit.   We've got children dying in public housing due to a complete lack of fucks at housing NZ.   We've got house prices going up $2000 a week and anecdotally a severe speculator and investor issue in regards to people inflating the prices of houses, which they profit from, ~~which then isn't taxed.~~ ^See ^below ^for ^correction  We've got the young walking out uni with stonking student loans and a government which isn't providing any incentives for companies to keep employing NZ staff.  We've got no government party with a meaningful action plan to address climate change.   We've got families living in garages still in chch thanks to being shafted by their insurance companies, and again a government that couldn't give a Fuck.    And we've got a government which refuses to recognize there's a massive fucking rental problem in the major centres and they have an over budget, under delivered housing scheme to supposedly address it.   And that's just what I could think of off the top of my head.  Pull your head from the sand, this country is being driven into the ground.   Bigger than me?    Best idea so far, I like it!          What the fuck is wrong with people?  Want to kill someone? Grab your keys, grab a cellphone and drive into someone while texting. Fucking marvellous.   And... [Pensioners profit while the young fall behind](http://www.stuff.co.nz/business/money/68616805/pensioners-profit-while-the-young-fall-behind.html)  Fucking Wonderful. As if this cuntry (sic) needed another reason for the young to give to two middle fingers to this Godforesaken ageist bullshit old fart lead country who have little issue with burning the ties with the younger generation so the degenerates can sell off this country piece by piece to foreign buyers, reaping in the profits while these total fat cat pricks will sit back on their [parlimentary pension](http://www.nzpensionprotest.com/Home/the-offenders/the-real-double-dipper) while dipping into the pension and whatever other benefits they can get their grubby mitts on while they pay stupendous amounts of money to their accountants to hide the rest of their greed gotten ill gains from selling their property portfolio while they stoke the property market into a frenzy.   Edit: Fuck our leaders. Just totally over their bullshit. 27 year old, I thought by this stage I would have more of an interest in politics, as I thought it would be more relevant to me. Now I've come to realise how completely out of touch our politicians are, how completely easily and lawfully they can be bought by corporations and other governments, and how there are no government parties that aren't greedy some way shape or form.   None of them speak for me, none of them speak for the younger generation (18 - 35) and it's incredibly frustrating to hear time after time... Why aren't you doing better?... Why can't you afford a house?... Why don't you have a better job?... Why aren't you earning more?... When in reality those jokes, about "If I had a dollar everytime a babyboomer asked why we can't afford a house then we could probably afford a house with the economy they fucked over.   My child has no hope of walking away from university without a horrendous student loan, and that's if the government hasn't allowed all the companies to outsource any job worth doing to a foreign country.  Our country is fucked. Our government is fucking it hard, you can't beat a dead horse, but you can rape it.   I know I came across like a fuckwit with my previous comments in regards to this subject (redditors who have long memories..) and I apologise, this is the best outcome from this horrible situation.

Going to shameless steal a heartbreaking article from /u/onewhitelight [heartbreaking interview with family who lost a child in a car.](http://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/magazine/fatal-distraction-forgetting-a-child-in-thebackseat-of-a-car-is-a-horrifying-mistake-is-it-a-crime/2014/06/16/8ae0fe3a-f580-11e3-a3a5-42be35962a52_story.html)   Fucking moron. Places like this rely on tourists obeying the rules as they need the tourists money. All it takes is fucking idiot to think the rules don't apply to them, get themselves killed and people are saying shut it down, and kill the animal involved. Why? For being a wild animal? No, just follow the damn rules you stupid knobs.

 I thought buying anything on those darknet sites was illegal because there's no sort of tax to be paid? Or is it just illegal to sell stuff on it? I swear I read that somewhere.   Kratom. Look into it.   If there's one thing I know for sure, it's that I would fuck the shit out of Joan of Arc. That's one heroine I could do all night long, baby.   No. Get your source on. Everybody calls each other shills though. It's a term of endearment, you see. You filthy shill.   WHAT    Now I have a boner.   Empty pill bottles.   I'm surprised the kratom didn't just slide right down your throat nice and easy, considering all the shlong you jam down it on the regular.   I tried changing the permissions, it didn't work or wouldn't let me change them, I can't remember. I'll try it again and I'll check out the other thing you just mentioned when I get home. Thanks   I originally tried installing Tor that way (by downloading it from the website) and I could never get it started. IIRC, it would just pop up a window full of code in gedit. I looked it up and found out that I have to download it from Software Center, so I did that, and it worked. However, when I tried to reinstall it yesterday from there, it still didn't work. After I get out of work, I'll try your suggestion again. I'm gonna be pissed if I have to install a different OS just because I can't get Tor to work. Actually I should probably just set up a dedicated USB drive for it anyway.   I already tried that last night. Still doesn't launch. Really aggravating.    Pretty sure there was an automatic update installed yesterday or the day before for Tor, and I don't remember whether I tried using it since then. It worked fine before, now the browser doesn't even start. I also went to software center and downloaded Vidalia, just to see if that would work, and it didn't. I already restarted. What do?   2.5 billion people don't have access to toilets. 6 billion people have access to cell phones, which means there's a whole shit ton of people out there surfing reddit that don't have the luxury of pissing in a toilet. How dare you.      Yes, I suppose it is. I'm surprised the smear campaigns launched by the media don't tell men everywhere that they'll be pissing sitting down. Might actually deter people. I think it's great. Unless I have a boner, and it touches against the inside of the toilet. I could do without that happening to me.   http://www.blessedmotherschildren.com/uploads/3/0/2/8/3028145/3366178.jpg?292   I take 15-18 grams of kratom a day. Mostly red veins.  Because of my moderate kratom intake, I drink a gallon of water a day.   I also chew tobacco all day long, which makes me incredibly thirsty all the time... I find that may actually work at my advantage  considering the dehydration kratom tends to cause.   I probably piss in the toilet an average of 18 times a day.   I realize a lot of toilet-pissing is to be expected when one drinks a gallon of water a day, but I feel like I really need to piss even more often than that should warrant.  Sometimes I'll piss in the toilet, and then 15 minutes later I'll feel like I need to piss in the toilet again, so I try to, and it takes a while for the piss to come out and then when it does, it's only like a 15 second piss.   I guess what I'm trying to say is, I get the "gotta go piss in the toilet" sensation even when it's unwarranted. Does anybody else ever notice this?   It's also the same sensation I get when I'm doing meth or amphetamines, I feel like I always gotta piss a little.   I can sort of understand why that is though, because the crank is speeding my system up and pushing fluids out or whatever.   Unfortunate thing about meth-toilet-pissing is that I always dribble into my boxers a little bit after every piss. At least the kratom doesn't seem to have the same effect.  I digress.  I also seem to have a hard time getting the piss started. There's a lot of stop-n-go hesitation my stream as well. A touch of misting going on.  Because of this, I started sitting down when I piss. I'd done it before, when I was on opiates sometimes, because I would try to piss for an hour straight, and I'll be God damned if I'm gonna fuck up my buzz by standing there trying to piss for an hour, when I could at least be sitting on the toilet and nodding for most of it.  I own a smartphone. I use it every time I'm on the toilet. This just contributes to the madness. Gotta check reddit, gotta see who's locked up on MobilePatrol, fuck around and post a couple disgusting comments on Whisper, stay up to date with imgur.   Between the pissing and the subsequent smartphone use, I probably spend an hour and a half on the toilet every day.   TL; DR    Does kratom make anybody else have to piss when they really shouldn't even need to?     That's what you get for living in a town with shitty weed.   Moneygram on local bitcoin   I just use my old lady's mouth to shit in.   Do you like hot sweaty shlongs slapped against your face?   Had you changed anything right before the issues started (strain, vendor, food)? Sounds almost like the kratom had bacteria in it. Almost like food poisoning, maybe? I don't have much knowledge on that sort of stuff.    Yeah I guess it can't hurt to swap the filter out and see what happens. Just after the warranty ran out, the brake line blew, and we took it back to the garage, where I was prepared to pay the full fee in order to have it changed, and the guy did it completely for free, so maybe he'll help me out. Lol. Probably not though. Ok, so I just started it up and got it up on some ramps. It was knocking right after it started, then it stopped, I drove it up onto the ramps and while I was driving up the ramps, it started knocking loudly, and the oil pressure light came on. I got to the top of the ramp and put it in park and I hopped out to go open the hood while it was still idling, and then I sort of heard a thunk and the knocking went away and the oil pressure light shut off and then it seemed ok, other than a very small knocking noise, which I could have probably dismissed as normal any other day.    Oh ok, that makes sense. It didn't seem to be idling lower than usual.  The oil pressure light came on right when I got to work, when we went up the inclined driveway, then it went right back off. The story I told you above, with the stalling, all happened within half a mile from my work. I'm wondering if it's a good idea to even start it and try to drive it to the garage we got it from or not. She just got it like 45 days ago, using buy here pay here at a local garage. Unfortunately it's past the 30 day warranty but I'm hoping maybe he'll do something for us in the way of a trade or something. I'm assuming he'll say no though, since he has the right to.   The oil filter is mounted upside down (with the threaded side facing skyward), on the side of the block.   Two days ago, I changed the oil on my old lady's 2001 Chevy Impala 3800. It has 118k miles. I used a FRAM Tough Guard oil filter, and SuperTech SAE 10W-30 oil. She went to work last night, and this morning she said she heard the engine knocking. She came and picked me up and took me to work, and when we'd almost made it to work, the engine was knocking badly. I told her to pull over so I could pop the hood, and it stalled. I popped the hood, checked the oil, which was right where it should be, and hopped back in and told her to keep driving to my work. It kept knocking, we got there and it stalled. The oil pressure light also came on and back off once or twice. I read that FRAM filters often have faulty anti-drainback valves. Has anybody here ever experienced the same thing? I plan on changing the filter later today, I'm just hoping that will do the trick. I could see it causing the engine to knock and the oil pressure light to come on, but would it cause it to stall? I also checked to make sure the filter or drain bolt isn't leaking. Thanks in advance.   Crack them mother fuckers open if you don't feel like waiting so long for the buzz to DROP ON YOUR FACE SON   This is a fine post, son.   You'll want to use a carrier pigeon.    To avoid abscesses in your arms, inject it directly into your testicle.    Yes. -3.   Sounds like you may be impervious to such things. Better go get you some heroin.   http://www.wikihow.com/Make-a-Potato-Gun  You're welcome   In the prison I was in, you could get a haircut from an inmate barber every other day if you wanted to. You just go to the barbershop during rec. You generally bring them some tobacco, although you don't have to according to the facility's rules, it's just the polite thing to do since those barbers don't get paid much for cutting your hair. 12 cents an hour or some shit. I always just had another inmate in my dorm do it right in the bathroom with a set of clippers, though.   Well, he did put a hit out on a dude. What do you think he should get? lol   I got caught with a little bit of leftover mud from cooking meth and I got a fuckin 4 flat with 3 post... and it was for personal use! Filthy assholes. I got out on bail, then got sentenced to four years, did 4 months in regular prison until my sentence got short enough for boot camp, then I went and did 8 months of that. That boot camp is a mother fuckin life saver, I only did 1 year out of 4 because of it, but I shouldn't have been sentenced to 4 fuckin years for personal use in the first place.    I got a buddy that'll give you three bucks for a handjob. You can use the extra thirty cents for a couple of ramen soups.   I'm pissed cuz I want to see what everybody's raving about, but I'll shit in my hand and eat it before I'll ever spend more money on that shit again.   That's funny, I ordered the Maha Kali and it made me shaky and feel like shit. This was 2 or 3 months ago. Maybe it was the same batch you had. It was the only time I've ever tried it, I just gave it away for free the other day.   TL; DR  I got really high and enjoyed it but I could still talk so I might have gotten ripped off. help   I thought his ma was addicted to injecting semen   It might be a good idea to abstain from kratom for 24 hours before you do, considering the dehydration aspect of it.   Oh, I can see why you believed him.  Because it's totally possible to dump a spoonful of leaf grounds into a cup of coffee without the drinker even noticing.   Mother fuckers be trollin. Mother fuckers be fallin for it, too. They always do.   BOBANDY    Oh I know I'm right, that's why I agree with you bro. My buddy was taking 5 grams of all natural Red Sumatran after he came down on Adderall, and it basically just took the edge off and let him sleep. I said "No, no, no, you're doing it wrong" and I handed him a few Xanax for the next time he was coming down off Adderall. He took them and just banged his head off stuff in his apartment for about an hour and then he passed out. I was happy to reduce his harm that day. We're doing the Lord's work, son.   You're right, benzos are much safer than kratom. What were we thinking?   Sometimes I get the numbers "3" and "10" confused too.   I just wanted to let you know that I found this post mildly entertaining. Thanks bub.   Red vein mother fuckin Sumatran, son.   Don't worry. It's probably just HIV.   Mine is more like    I jacked off into a napkin this morning.   I dunno. I'm being sarcastic. I have no idea what he means.   I'm actually the complete opposite. Kratom is the only thing I've ever found (outside of weed) that I can use at the same dose 3 times a day and still have it work every time.    THEY GIVE THE DASH TO YOUR POST, HOW IS THAT HARD FOR YOU TO COMPREHEND   The test_subject7558's hilarity is timeless, son.   My thoughts exactly.   What   It's done a lot for me too, man. It worries the hell out of me that there's people out there who don't know shit about it,  and they're trying to get it banned.   Which antiemetic do you use?   I've never tried it, and IDK all that much about it, but I would check this out if I was in the same predicament: https://www.bluebird.com/   What are they going to report me for? Talking about things other than kratom? Kratom keeps me off the meth and other drugs. That's how it's relevant. Either way, you can't tell me what I can or can't talk about. I never portray kratom in a negative light. Are you trollin me, son?    Suboxone for the rest of your life? You can't even feel it every time you take it, you just feel normal. It does nothing for cravings after you're accustomed to it. I've been on the sub maintenance program twice. However, I feel great from kratom every day when I take it, three times a day... Every fucking day. It completely eradicates any sort of cravings I have. Kratom is a thousand times more effective than subs. You should think about switching completely.   Get looped on kratom? Pfft. Let me know when you find it.   There's a shit storm brewin  	66

 Seconded! How strange does "African-Canadian" sound? Such silliness...   I'm response to having an old man smell:  "I know what he's talking about. I grow mungbeans in my desk. Highly nutritious, but they smell like death"   Do it. It's pretty good. Definitely worth more than a "meh" and in the same vein Captain America as the lead impressed me I kept forgetting it was him, he did really well.    Loved it. Now I have to watch that movie again.

I've never wanted that before...   This whole comment thread is deleted, yet I knew we were talking about Frank Reynolds from your comment alone. Well played sir.  Also, devito in that role is the perfect answer to this question so I don't know why it's deleted..   YES! It's arguable he reinvented his acting career starting with that role; no one expected him to commit so fully to being ridiculous; it was amazing and hilarious and made me appreciate him as an actor again.   Sidenote: he also really impressed me in Edge of Tomorrow, plus that whole movie rocked pretty hard.    Always remember to scream! Sometimes I tell myself that if I'm feeling anxious or something that if I just start screaming, everyone will leave me alone.

Or maybe it's a time and place situation? This was not the time and place to highlight open-carry issues so maybe that's obnoxious? I feel like calling it racist is a bit of a stretch tho, but maybe I don't know the whole story..  Edit: spellings   	9
    Meetup.com   OP is just another MRA nutjob stirring up controversy, move along, nothing to see here   Agreed. The article called him a gay cartoon in the show, I think that's pretty accurate.   I am generally OK with the many larger changes the show makes - Sansa taking Jeyne's place, Jamie and Bronn in Dorne, etc - They make sense given a limited scope and timeframe. I agree that they'll miss out on some great Barristan scenes, but I guess they have a different direction in mind.  I still have a problem with the way some characters are portrayed. I feel the show really misses the subtleties of certain characters, mainly Tyrion and Littlefinger. The actors are great for both, don't get me wrong, but Tyrion is totally whitewashed and is missing his darker side. Littlefinger is portrayed almost comically evil, whereas in the books I feel he is more clever and not an obviously villain to anyone with half a brain.          You could not play thoughtsteal. ..

I guess it no longer qualifies, but I'm still interested in the sequel...   is this r/books or r/circlejerk?   * *a cure for suicide* by jesse ball  * *the sarah book* by scott mcclanahan   120 days of Sodom by marquis de sade   *Sometimes a Great Notion* by Ken Kesey   a 3 year old is most likely not going to enjoy the hobbit. wait 3 or 4 years   I'd try *Book of the New Sun* by Gene Wolfe then    Characters are humorless, often overinflated badasses who just say cool things and kill stuff with aplomb. It reads like a teen's role-playing chatroom: "And then I do this, because I'm awesome!"   Pretty sure he won't like Name of the Wind   It sounds like you hate fantasy. My real recommendation would be to just avoid it, but you could try something more literary I guess - Gene Wolfe, Italo Calvino, Angela Carter, etc.   Mercer Meyer's *Little Critter* books  *Where the Wild Things Are* by Maurice Sendak  edit: my kids also really like books where they can interact with things. Examples are the books *Don't Push the Button* and *Tap to Play*               bingo   Holden Caulfield            r/homeworkhelp            there are a million other renowned authors out there, read something by one you actually like instead   I thought it was kind of average. Nice prose, lot of cliches.            It makes me laugh that people claim Sanderson is "the best fantasy writer alive" when his dialogue is simply pretty bad. How can you be the best alive if you can't write dialogue that isn't cringe inducing?   Kobo Abe is really great. He is like the Japanese Kafka.   the enormous boom of dark fantasy. The TV show is also incredibly influential, just take a look how game of thrones knock offs there are already   David Markson -  *Readers Block, This Is Not A Novel, Vanishing Point, The Last Novel*   psstt.....he's dead   lol yeah dude the government never hides anything   I really like Bukowski, but I can definitely understand your viewpoint. I think he still has something to offer, but wouldn't fault anyone for not wanting to read him.   never read him actually, though taipei is in my TBR pile   * Sam Pink - Rontel/Person  * Scott McClanahan - Crapalachia/Hill William/Collected Works  * Megan Boyle - selected unpublished blog posts of a mexican panda express employee  recommend starting with Scott, easily one of my favorite authors   I generally agree with you, but it's the sanitation/self censorship inherent in YA that draws me away. I don't want to read something the author had to write down to a more consumer friendly level.   There are plenty of entertaining adult books too   My major qualm with YA is the readers who only read YA and wear it like a badge of honor. Anti-intellectualism is nothing to be proud of.   Both sides are guilty, yes. I'm pretty comfortable in thinking the side that is actively advocating hatred towards other groups is worse though                  Clearly *Stoner* by John Williams   Not too hard when your job is grinding hearthstone matches   My complaint is that these things detract from what I actually go to a bookstore for - a good selection of books. I don't care that Amazon sells them as well, because Amazon's selection is enormous.  Why should I take the time out of my day to drive down to a bookstore for a book they may or may not have at a higher price? What incentive is there for me?   What an asinine comment.  Major chain bookstores deserve their death - horrid selection of books, prices higher than Amazon, half the floor space dedicated to toys, board games, ereaders, and Starbucks.  Indie bookstores I am more sympathetic for, but more of them need to adapt. There is a pretty charming indie bookstore near me. Browsing their selection, I came across a used book I was interested in that they were selling for more than 40 bucks. I'm not asking for a price match, but a quick look on my phone showed multiple retailers selling it for $0.01 plus 4 bucks shipping.  If you are actually lucky enough to have a bookshop with fair pricing, an eclectic selection, and cool events like author readings, yes, you should probably support your bookstore if you are there often.  I am rooting for local bookshops in this time of ebooks/amazon/major chains, but the onus shouldn't be on me to support them if they refuse to adapt.      my man. harry crews is criminally underrated.   you aren't really qualified to criticize a book if you only read 20 pages   That's not the focus of the books at all. Yes the world is gritty, but HBO and mass media make a much bigger deal of the violence and nudity.   you must not read that much then   Don't forget the awkward sexualized 15 year old!   Depression and death of a sibling are first world problems?   Mr. Flieslikeafish, Mongoloid, Esq.:  You are, in your incomprehensible babble, unable to assimilate stimulating concepts into your retarded and blighted worldview. We here at r/books do not wish to be bothered in the future by such tedious complaints. If you molest us again, sir, you may feel the sting of the lash across your pitiful shoulders.   I like it!    On the Beach. Interesting premise, but awful characterization. All female characters are written as one dimensional, wooden, and helpless. Totally unbelievable reactions from all characters. Boring as anything to boot   The Hugos are irreparably damaged.   Doesn't give you a get out of being an asshole free card, sorry   lol, you really took the article to heart dude. "ladies you are welcome to play as long as you aren't slutty trash"   What source is more reliable to break the news than kdramastars.com   Very much agreed, that's a large reason why I stopped playing competitively   welcome to playing magic the gathering...            That's not quite the point of this thread, is it   there's a surprise   you're an idiot   It isn't bad, but you're probably missing out on a lot of books you may like. Have you tried reading recent acclaimed works - 2666, Middlesex, Gilead, The Corrections, etc?   What does immersion have to do with a quality storyline?   Let's be real here. I'm no stranger to gaming myself, and claiming that "you make all the decisions yourself" is painting with a bit of a broad stroke. There are very few games that allow you total or even partial freedom. Something like Mass Effect style choices are akin to choose your own adventure books, maybe even simpler.   Dark Souls and Bloodborne are both exceptions rather than the rule. I would include both in games with a good storyline. Even still, the number of games with a quality storyline is only a handful.   For every Planescape Torment there are mountains of awful, hackneyed storylines.    i like stories, but right now im interested in some books that will expand my knowledge, or be useful in real life.  Maybe you should read a book that explains how fiction can do all of that and more   Unepic is pretty bad. Boring combat, tedious gameplay, awful humor. One of the worst metroidvanias I've played.         I read 5 of them. Silence Once Begun, Annihilation, All the Light We Cannot See, and Station Eleven are all pretty great   Everything isn't literal   Kraken is probably his worst book. Mieville isn't for everyone but I wouldn't judge him solely based off one of his least liked books      a new marketing term      No it isn't, nobody is giving dynasty advice. He sucked last year and was overhyped   After seeing what was done with the True Blood Series, do you have interest in doing a television adaptation of the Midnight, Texas series? If so, what would you do differently (Would you still go to HBO? Would you try to have more of an active involvement in the production? Would you try and keep the adaptation closer to the books?)   I don't think there's anything wrong with enjoying YA novels - they can be entertaining and should be judged individually rather than as a genre.   That said, I find it weird that some people choose to only read YA novels, and wear that fact like a badge of honor. Is there something to be proud of in only liking novels that are less challenging and more accessible?        One of my all time favorites         Investigative journalism seems to be under attack around the world. I wish him luck.         "As beautifully wrought and subtle and nuanced as some of these tales can be, they still largely tend to serve the function of propaganda, regardless of the authors intention. Even in condemning war, they end up romanticizing, glorifying, and legitimizing it on some level (often on many levels) and are added to a giant heap of stories that do the same."  Pretty much why I won't be bothering to read Phil Klay's book     my dick is huge too!   goodreads.com         The man is a living legend   He is about as far as you can get from cool, he's a homophobic douche      Reread the Phantom tollbooth recently, it was still enjoyable   I don't understand some of the criticism about this book. Not liking a character has nothing to do with the quality of the book. He's meant to be an unlikable character, that's the point   don't do this, the fourth book is underrated. Cersei's storyline in particular is great   how dare you criticize reddit's lovechild   The entire book itself isn't even 200 pages...   It's incredibly dense though, page count is a poor indicator. That said, it's one of the few books I've really hated as well.     	132
    [Relevant](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgPwXlTRuHs)    **...anytime...**   Wouldn't be surprised if it was still Jax's voice.   Another klassic ninja skin? Awesome. Won't be long before we have the full set... hopefully. I know a lot of people really want a klassic Ermac skin, I hope they get it.  That infrared skin, is it just for Scorpion or is it for eveyone? I think Scorpion's got enough costumes already.   Mah ninja.   Probably the one where God flooded the Earth, killing very nearly every living thing, and not giving a fuck while doing it.  That's pretty metal.   hIS RAMPAnT anD UnBRiDLED CAPITaLISAtION UPsets mE!   What do you guys think about the outrageous price (considering the content on offer) of the next Destiny expansion, The Taken King, and the fact that if you own the game and all current DLC you'll have to completely re-buy the game and the DLC if you want the new emotes they're offering?      Ok, thanks.   OKC?   Pretty impressive paint considering it doesn't smudge onto everything he touches.    Does the stats of the parents affect the stats of the child? If so I need to turn Dr. Li into a baby making machine!   I didn't mean it like all game have been 60fps before these la two generations, just that they seemed to have more games running 60fps than the recent gens do.    Yeah. I've played plenty of games on my PS4 that run at 60fps, like Rogue Legacy and Metal Gear Solid V Ground Zeroes. 60fps is possible on these consoles, but I guess some devs are either too lazy or too inept to make their games run at 60fps **cough Ubisoft cough**   I see it now. Thanks for clarifying. Seems to be missing a load of frames of animation for the slap.   "Why would you give us brains capable of rational thought, but then punish those of use who exercise that rational thought and come to the conclusion that not only is it unlikely that you exist, but it's logically impossible?"   I CAN ask any question. I don't understand yours I'm afraid.   You used "to" when you should have used "too". Nice try English impersonator!  Comcast confirmed ;)   Nah what ain't? I don't understand what you're disagreeing with me about. It seems we agree that the latest batch of consoles are having difficulty with meeting 60fps, so where's the beef?  Can't believe I managed to fit "where's the beef?" into a sentence and have it be contextually accurate, lol.   I don't get it.   1. I don't think covering mass shootings actually encourages them. It probably doesn't discourage them though.  2. Was going to comment on your misuse of the word "your", but I see someone beat me to it, and your reply made me smile. So have a few upvotes on me.   Consoles have been capable of 60fps for years. It's only the recent generations with their much much much  more complicated graphics and physics engines that are having difficulty.   I must be missing something. Does she just salute and then their face explodes?   You can get lunchboxes by completing some challenges. The lunchboxes have given me some great loot that I've not come close to finding in the wasteland yet. I haven't bought any lunchboxes yet though. They gave us a few near the beginning to whet our appetites, now they're really few and far between.   So he grew up and started dating his mum?      How is [Retro Bruce](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wa6iCGHRzqQ) not constantly at the top of r/ladyboners?   "...jams a pistol into the man's skull."  Not really, more like "...puts a pistol to the man's head."   One of the good guys. See? Good cops do exist, they just don't get anywhere near the attention of the bad ones.   Let's see if this makes it to the front page 2 days running.   I started with Unbreakable Sub Zero but someone recommended I switch to GM because of my playstyle. I've never looked back.  Well, I look back from time to time at that awesome ice mask I so dearly miss.   Hayfever.   I got Dr. Li from a lunchbox as well as a guy called John Rice, both have very high intelligence.  Making a stimpack in 90 seconds? Yes please.   I just get sick of all the PC master retards gloating over every little console issue, feels good that the boot is on the other foot.    Never played. Pay day game.       Klassic ninja FTW.   Shit, I'm too lazy to find the thread from 2 days ago when this was posted and leech the top comment.  Damn.   Hmm. Might buy.  Next story.    I'm gonna fail out of college  Were you even alive when FFVII was released?   I never played Kingdom Hearts 1 or 2 seeing as though I was 17 at the time and was more into Metal Gear Solid and Tekken than I was Disney characters.  What makes the games so good? Seems they've got a massive following.   This is great news. I was concerned that the long anticipated follow up to the most expensive game ever (at the time) was going to only cost $2million.    Hey, it's a rare day when PC gamers suffer while console players have no issues. Let me have this.  I need this...   stages in this game arent very hype  What does that even fucking mean?   I thought it was a mix of that and saving people from wasting their 3G on videos they never get around to finishing.   But... but... the mustard race!   I first unlocked the snowball one, but found it difficult to get on unless I was fighting a noob.  I was so relieved when I got the simple "freeze then uppercut" one with no criteria needing to be met like having 40+ seconds left on the clock or other shit like that.   Or you could just do what I do. Watch them show up in youtube sub box. That way I get to see all the trailers and announcements, and then reaction videos from people who's opinion I enjoy hearing.   I believe your username reveals the answer.   I'd imagine organs with some wiggle room, I dunno.   Good to know.   I know cats can tell you they're angry with their ears, but dogs can tell you they're happy/excited, sad/upset. Cats only really have one emotion anyway, indifferent.   It's just a simple way of conveying emotion. It seems like a horse's face can't emote like a human's without looking, weird. We know a lot of animals emote with their ears (dogs primarily). Not sure if horses do in real life. It doesn't seem strange to me that Bojack's ears move, in fact I'd say it seems quite logical.   Ever consider some people just want closure on the story? They just left us hanging on a cliff.  Also, each Half Life game that was released pushed the boundaries of what FPS games were capable of, and pretty much set the standard for the genre when they were released. The games might not be what the masses consider to be fun or exciting (although they are), they're technically groundbreaking games. This is why people want Valve to make another one.             but really it's entertainment and to hold it to such serious standards  They hold it to a much more serious standard than I do, lol. Every time I see a hip hip/rap music video (well, 85% of them) I just laugh at how ridiculous I find the whole thing.   I never did it back when I was at school, and even if I did that was 15+ years ago, so no, I don't still do that.  Never heard that rhyme before.   The whole false bravado thing they have going on.  "Look at me! Look at how rich I am! Look how much weed I smoke! Look how I wield my AK! Look at my car! Look at those shiny wheels! Look at all these hot women I paid to be in my video! Look at my comically over sized clothes! Look at all this jewelry I wear! Look at how much of a big hard gangster I am!"  Then watch them go home and be told by their wife they're not allowed chicken, so they have to send their assistant out to get it on the sly.  I find the whole thing to be a cringe worthy joke, the fact they take it so seriously only adds to the hilarity. I have no interest in listening to something that musically is extremely basic (often to the point of just re-using music someone else made that was already popular), and lyrically is both vapid and a lie.  There are some good hip hop songs, don't get me wrong. I don't think it's all shit, just the stuff I've mentioned here. Which seems to be 85% of it.   I remember we sang hymns at primary school during morning assemblies. After a while I realised I simply didn't buy the notion of a god and then stopped singing the hymns. No-one ever called me out on it, might have been different if I'd been in an American school.   What's hidden about it? Can't you unlock all the brutalities in the krypt?   I never got far in FFVII. I borrowed it from a friend back when it came out but never got off the first disc, I've had it on my PS3 for about 3 years now and haven't managed to play past the first 6 hours or so. I'm sure the game is good, but I can never seem to get into it. Final Fantasy VIII was my FF when I was younger (followed by X of course).  Hopefully this remake will keep me entertained enough to want to go back to the original one day and complete it.      Well that clears that up then. Thanks.    Uh... "A" to jump?   I didn't know 3 had MP. Was that in the subsistence version? I never played that version until I got the HD collection on PS3, and I never noticed MP in that version, although I wasn't looking for it.    we wanted to show people we could do it, and how little we care about it.   I wish the video wasn't limited to 144p. I must see this creature in higher quality so I can attempt to identify it.   "Shhhh. Just let it happen."   Ive never liked the horse shit mechanic. It just looks so fake compared to the general graphics in the game, at least to me.    What makes you think life has a meaning or a purpose? We exist, that's about all we can say.  Something I like thinking about is what is the one thing ALL life does, or tries to do?  Procreate/Attempt to perpetuate the survival of it's species.  By this logic you could argue that anyone who has a kid that reaches adulthood has technically won at life, kinda.   "That's be great."  Great grammar. Also making childish demands like this makes you seem like an asshole.   I don't care. My reddit usage hasn't changed one iota. Storm in a teacup.   It's fine. I don't feel like I'm in danger when using reddit. It's just a typical kneejerk reaction to people's freedoms supposedly being oppressed.  It seems a lot of people seem to think that reddit is somehow affected by the US government's constituion regarding free speech. Reddit owns reddit, they can silence whatever they want. I almost cannot believe how much of a big issue is being made over this, and the childish reaction from many redditors just makes me happy that a lot of them claim to be ready to leave reddit. We'll be better off without them.  Also people like to use the slippery slope argument. Whatever. What's the worst thing reddit could to us? Shut down the site I guess, that would be the ultimate form of "suppression of free speech", even though they're stopping people from saying what they want elsewhere.  I guess it depends on what you mean by safe.   On more than one occasion in the last year I've seen a guy, looks to be in his early 20's, riding an electric unicycle while I'm on my way home from work. It looked like this one but was dark grey instead of high viz yellow. Was weird as hell to watch. But so cool.   And I remember Tekken 3 being 45 at release. I guess different games have different prices.   I played the shit out of Metal Gear Solid 4. I tried the multiplayer once and hated it beyond words, to the point where I groaned with disappointment when they announced multiplayer in MGSV.    True. But it seems every day someone in America posts a random dog/cat they just found wandering around outside.   Good response, thanks.   Some were, most were 40. Maybe games were cheaper where you live for some reason.   My mistake. Should have read it properly. Thanks for the clarification.   Huuuge bucket of win.   Not just the 90's. He recently released [this single](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TnFIDKyX50) just a couple of years ago.   Does America have a serious problem of just cats and dogs all over the place looking for homes? Seems every day someone makes a post to reddit about how some random homeless animal turned up and now it's theirs. How are animal shelters still running with so many free pets everywhere?   I hope you're doing something about that morbidly obese pet.    30 used to be the norm  When? I remember Street Fighter II Turbo and Sonic Spinball being 55 back in 1993. That equates to roughly 101 in today's money. Sure most games weren't 55 back then, but some were. I remember the average price of a Mega Drive game being around 40, going up 10 - 15 in 20 years isn't so bad really. Games may technically be more expensive now but considering how little the price has risen since the 16 bit era compared to how much content games now have they've never been better value for money than they are right now.   FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUCK you Konami.   So it's true, Konami ARE trying to burn the MGS franchise to the ground like that guy once said.   *if it gets out of control.   Claws, not toenails.   Upon further thunking I suppose the Indian guy represents that part of Asia (Pakistan, India etc). The American Asian guy represents the other part of Asia (Japan, China etc), while the French guy represents Europe.  Maybe.   I still don't buy the trailer just happening to reconnect on it's own. I don't believe it.   So there's two Americans, a different kind of American, a Frenchie, and an Indian guy.  This represents the whole world according to the director.   It is cool, as it was yesterday.   The guy said all he used was a "handling mod". Looks like this mod includes super turbo and auto "suck trailer back to the hook up point of the truck" features.   She didn't make /r/ALL FPH, childish morons who have kneejerk reactions to shit did that for her.   [How I feel about this whole thing.](http://tasteuni-co-uk.optimizewpcom.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/14309-go-to-the-winchester-have-a-nice-cold-pint-and-wait-for-all-of-this-to.jpg)    But they never actively harassed someone out of the subreddit  Irrelevant whether it's in or out of the subreddit surely. What's SRS anyway? I keep hearing people say it but don't know what it is, sounds really shitty though.  they only hate those who are fat and deny it, or ignore it.  Well, that makes their harassment ok then. /s   If it's a shithole you think should burn why are you still here?      Those new replacement subreddits are obviously created with the sole intention of replacing the old ones and continuing to harass people, that's why they're getting banned.   I just woke up and logged on, let me know if I've got this right.  The story is cunts told to shut up, people get upset?      Perhaps.    I just checked out one of the other angles. I'd really love to know how how got that speed in that truck given the relatively short road leading up to the jump. Experimenting later.   To make it seem more impressive.  But yeah, since he said that I guess I'm inclined to believe him. I'm curious to know how this custom handling mod affects trailers. I'm going to record and post my own attempts at this jump on PS4 and see if the truck really can fly that much from that jump.   "Kombat me, FOOL!"   The free aim shooting in fallout 3 and new vegas are pure shit. I'd say 99.9% of my kills with guns in those games was using vats, the control really was that bad. At least on console.   Vats is what makes Fallout stand out. Fallout is an RPG and those numbers have to count somewhere, with vats you can see the numbers in action.   Two reasons I don't use horses in Skyrim.  #1. I have a follower. #2. They're shit.   Not in a truck like that, pulling a trailer.   There's no truck in the game that would fly like that off that jump without moon gravity, especially pulling a trailer.  I might have to check later on just to make sure.   You got an apostrophe right and then neglected to use one in "reddits".  0/10 unsubscribed would recommend to a friend.   Indeed. I do enjoy his dialogue though. Not sure why. I just like the words he uses.   FYI. They're called couch gags.   It's too awesome to believe. Obviously moon gravity is on. Seems too good to be true without mods though.   [Literally every man in this thread](http://www.reactiongifs.com/r/dgbg.gif)    There is nothing wrong with telling someone this in hopes that they will make a plan and succeed.   I agree. But saying it in a dickish manner as he did was unnecessary. It seemed like he was bringing anger from people in r/fitness to people who did nothing to warrant the attitude.   Raiden's character is like this.  Tries to protect Earthrealm. Is pretty much useless at his job.   This is the kind of attitude I've come to expect from regular gym goers, and one of the reasons I don't go.   This concerns me about going to the gym. I need to start going to work off the flab I've built up in the 4 years I've had this office job, but I've never been to a gym before. I don't want to end up on youtube as one of those noobs who's using a machine wrong or something like that. Plus I keep hearing tales of assholes at gyms.  Maybe I'll just take up jogging instead.   "Homeboy!"  Classic line. Also, is it just my player or is the video really fucking stretched horizontally? They all look like super midgets.   It was delicious.    When he fights Jason he simply says:   "Kombat me, fool!"  So fucking cool.    It happens in the natural world, who are we tip the balance in the bee's favour?   It just looks medieval to me. If the Elder Scrolls hadn't been mentioned in the title the thought would never have crossed my mind.            I don't recall saying I don't find it compelling.  I'm looking forward to seeing it. I liked Silent Running, and this seems like it's got a similar theme.  I was just wondering what I was missing, it seemed everyone was super mega excited about it and I didn't know why. Now I now why. It was a popular book and people love Ridley Scott.    I wasn't looking at my phone. I shut the video off because it was time to leave work and go home.   "I remember now! Today is the day I met you!"   SPAAYCE!   I don't recall saying anything about interacting with them, but how do you know aliens wouldn't interact with us? We don't know their motives. Sure it's more likely that they'd observe us before doing anything, that's just common sense.   Once they realized we're all poo-flinging hate monkeys, they'd likely pass us by.  I bet if we're the first planet they've seen with life on it (besides their own) they'd be pretty interested in us.   If they found us I reckon they'd observe us for a while, no idea what they'd do after that. They might just leave once they see how primitive we are compared to them. If this is the first planet they've seen with life on it (besides their own) they'd probably either want to interact with us, or they might do the whole "Don't interfere with nature" thing.  My thing is if they've got the tech to get here they'd surely have the tech to remain hidden from us, and they certainly wouldn't come all the way here to just crash like some people think, they'd be pretty inept aliens if they did that.  Sure there's some unexplained sightings, but they're just that, unexplained. Most sightings have been explained as being something like a plane, weather balloon (cliche I know) or just strange lighting. I think the time to believe aliens have visited us is when there's good evidence to support it, not anecdotal heresay and footage which can be easily manipulated digitally.   I'll agree with you that maybe the skater should have taken more care. Still a total over reaction by the mother though. She was acting like she was certain he ran into the kid on purpose.   For some reason I don't buy Matt Damon as an astronaut from these two trailers, maybe it was the line "I'm gonna have to science the shit out of this." That line just sounds fucking dumb to me. He just seems like the wildly unscientific scientists in Prometheus    I know man. It was "coming soon" for what felt like months. then it arrived and was immediately removed because it somehow still wasn't ready.  I'm beginning to think this game is being supported by monkeys. I haven't played for over a week. I refuse to play until Raiden turns up. Even then, the combat is just pretty boring compared to Injustice. I don't know if I'll eve get back into this game. Very disappoint with it from day 1 to now.   That's what I believe, yes. I've not seen anything that's convinced me otherwise.   People don't just start to say things like that.  Yes they do. People see things in the sky that they can't identify, some people think it's alien ships, I think they're mistaken.  There's so many things these people could have seen, at the end of the day they saw a UFO, the U meaning unidentified, meaning they don't know what it is, jumping to conclusions that it's aliens is silly.  I don't believe anyone has seen aliens visit Earth. I believe aliens exist, but not that they've been here. Based on the fact that we KNOW people lie, and we KNOW people are prone to being mistaken, and we KNOW our senses are easily fooled, and we haven't seen any verifiable evidence of aliens being here, I don't believe people who claim to have seen alien space ships have actually seen alien space ships.   I don't think I've ever been not ok with my own mortality. I don't want to die but I know it's going to happen, I just have to try to stave it off for a long as I can.  Where was I before I was born? That's where I'll be when I'm dead.   Depends on the girl I guess. Suspicion would probably be my first thought.   But what if you flew over somewhere you'd never been before and saw a creature you'd never seen before? Would you check them out or just go "huh" and keep flying?   True. But conversely you can have a bad film that has entertaining aspects such as the action.    Even if 50% of those are made up  What makes you think any of them aren't made up?   I believe aliens exist because it's pretty much a mathematical impossibility that this planet is the only one that has life on it.  I don't believe aliens have visited Earth.   And that's when it's time to play Bodies in your head and drop a bitch. It was an honest accident. The kid and skater collided, didn't look like anyone was in error either way, mother over reacts, punches a guy because women are untouchable right? Deserves a punch back IMO.   Triggered!   I suspect he may be misusing the word "mate".   I'm interested to hear what the woman of reddit has to say on the matter. I bet she's got some interesting opinions.   If I were going out with a girl and she later revealed she used to be a man I'd be pretty pissed off. That's the kind of shit that should be made clear beforehand.   Huh. And here I thought paths like that were laid by hand. This makes much more sense.   I saw Prometheus. His name doesn't carry a film for me any more.    Then I literally didn't see that part.   I'm not saying there's anything wrong with films made from books, not sure where you're getting the notion that I have a problem with that. It explains the hype I'm seeing. Before today I didn't know it was originally a popular book, knowing this pretty much answers the question posted in the title.    People feel as if too much attention was given to the human characters instead of the Transformers themselves.  Well I agree with you there. But I feel the films can still be enjoyable.   True Megan Fox didn't help IMO. But the explosions and changes never bothered me.   Nature in general is scary, the insect world is just fucked up.   It's not annoying me, it just looks kind of bland and pretty similar to Silent Runnings. Now I know it was a popular book beforehand (what isn't these days?) I can understand why people are excited about it.   I didn't say I didn't want to see it, I was just curious as to why it was making huge waves when there seems to be nothing new or unique about it at all, looks pretty similar to Silent Runnings to be honest. The fact that it was a popular book before this is news to me and goes a long way to explain the hype.   Yeah I didn't know it was a loved book already. I should have guessed though, everything seems to be adapted from a book these days. Thanks for the clarification.   Of course, what film isn't based on a book these days? I guess the book was popular even though I've never heard of it. Then again, I nevereven heard of Harry Potter until the first film was made.   I like the Transformer films, you know why? Because I like the Transformers, and I sometimes like to watch mindless action. People shit all over Bay's films because he likes to blow shit up, sometimes I want to see shit get blown up. There's always room for Whiplash, Birdman, The Theory of Everything. But there's also room for Transformers. Obviously the human elements of those films always suck balls and should be dropped from all future Transformer films, but I for one love watching giant robots beat the shit out of each other, and frankly I'm amazed that seemingly no-one else does.  How odd.  Transformers 2 is the obvious exception, that film can go die somewhere.   Can someone explain to me why this film is generating to much hype? It seems pretty cheesy to me. With cringeworthy lines like "Every human has the same instinct, the instinct to help each other out." and "I'm gonna have to science the shit out of this." I can't quite believe how much of a big deal people seem to be making of it, I must be missing some vital information.  Edit: The title is meant to read "...so much hype." not "...to much hype."   Can someone explain to me why this film is generating to much hype? It seems pretty cheesy to me. With cringeworthy lines like "Every human has the same instinct, the instinct to help each other out." and "I'm gonna have to science the shit out of this." I can't quite believe how much of a big deal people seem to be making of it, I must be missing some vital information.   I clicked the link, but before I could start reading the article a really obnoxious unmutable ad filled the screen.  Left that site without reading anything.   I like the way the blonde guy is like "Fuck this shit, I've seen this happen before."   [Here he is on the red carpet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMgXboVyxY0)   But it's coming. It's always coming.    Cars do have lights. But that doesn't mean people wearing black glow like lightbulbs when a cars lights are on them. If your main beams are on then yeah, they'll show up easier. But you'd be surprised how late you can see someone when they're walking in the dark and dress dark, on the road, with no reflective articles whatsoever. It's asking to be killed.    "Every human being has the same instinct. To help each other out."  Yeah, apart from all the ones who don't have that instinct. I hope this opening line isn't indicative of the message this film is going to try to portray.   I know. I have a fear of bees and I actually squirmed a couple of times watching this.  But I was facing my fear! So I'm a man!      ...right?   I approve of your username, even if you are kind of hard to find.   I guess you were lucky in so much as you had a great deal of empathy. Perhaps you were treated badly and thought "This is shitty, I'd never do this to another person." Some people just go "Oh, this is normal behaviour. I've got no problem being an asshole to other people."   I'm sorry to hear that but glad that he's doing well given the situation.         Back when I was playing this games I used Deathstroke, Doomsday, and Wonder Woman as my silver team. Pretty beast.   Your crazy cat lady is showing.   More like replacing the Puffin. This is just another meme where people are going to voice their disliking of certain things or types of people.      Maybe not blasted over and over and over, but kids to usually have to be taught right from wrong, that being mean to other people is wrong, and being nice to other people is, well... nice.   I wouldn't believe anything written on a website called psychic101.com lmao. In order for me to answer your question I'd have to think such a place exists in the first place, why do you believe it exists?   [Relevant](http://media.balls.ie/uploads/2014/01/Rocky.jpg)   Some people don't. I almost never skip them. It's always cool when you meet someone else who wants to see it as well.   define astral plane please.   I don't watch these videos that give away the dialogue. I'd much rather wait until the character's released and see them in person while playing ranked matches.   Wow, you'll have to be more specific than "those skinny models". Some pictures/examples would be helpful.  I don't like skeletons and I don't like huge fat women. Does that answer your question?   Don't look for logic in racism.   I was told I had to preorder GTAV to get access to the blimp. I preordered it 8 months before release to make sure I'd get a copy (this was back when I thought games could still sell out). I was standing in line with my Xbox 360 preorder but changed my mind to PS3 when my friend finally told me he was going to get it. So I picked up a PS3 copy, minus a pre-order, and I still go the blimp.  This was when I realised pre-ordering games was literally a waste of time.   I think it's more the fact that he made a pretty racist remark, but is still employed.  Could you imagine if a white professor had called predominantly black colleges "Black Chocolate Bumfuckery Township" and he kept his job?   Magic, next question.   Not worth it then IMO.   Record it on my phone and observe it.   "Its about how ridiculousness in love I am with you."  WAT?  	198

 SWIM got laughed at on the phone.  Twice.   I want to race my truck, not a bike.     I just tried.  I got laughed at on the phone.  She didn't know what I was asking, so I told her about top gear and how they race on tarmac, and there's no track around here, so how much would it cost to rent the tarmac for an afternoon?  They won't let me do that.  That was sort of embarrassing getting laughed at by the lady at the aeroport. O.o.     Damn it.  How hard would it to be to rent the airport runway for an afternoon?   Not totally soft, just not rock hard.  You have to be able to bend your dick.  Like think of the hottest person you can think of, and then half erect, think of your grandma.  Push it in, and go to town. :)      I don't either, but 290 HP on a 350 that I dropped in with dual quads. :)  I have more power than I know what to do with. :)   Man jumps naked over LA from a Cessna, only wearing a parachute and boots.   Che Geuvera. He is a literal murderer of thousands of people, but dumbass college kids seem to want to gay out with him.   [Fuck yourself in the ass](http://www.autoanal.com)   LOL!  It's been a long time since I've heard that joke! :D :D   I can do that too. :D    http://www.autoanal.com   I was on acid, but my end table turning into this strange machine that had gears and pulleys, and wheels and belts, and ramps and belts, and there were a bunch of 2" tall people running around making this machine work.  I couldn't figure out what the hell they were making, or what the machine was supposed to do, but it was the coolest thing I ever saw.  LSD is a hell of a drug, and you can see some amazing shit that is mind boggling.  **EDIT:**  I couldn't figure out what the hell they were doing, but I didn't try to engage and just watched it trying to figure out what the hell they were doing.  Whatever those mini-people were doing, they looked busy, so I didn't want to disturb them.  I had this thought of "Woah, what if this is how power really works?" and was looking for wires, but couldn't find any.  Since I couldn't figure out what the hell they were doing, I just watched. 20m later *poof* gone.  Then I decided to walk outside, and I "felt the gas station".  That was the coolest thing I ever felt. :)   *cough* pullman wa *cough*   *checks wallet*  Nope, not INS.   Is that even available to free members?  From what I hear, the A-List thing isn't really worth it.   Travel to a city  Therein lies the problem.  I just filled up, and my truck gets 11.9 MPG.   I was up at Stateline about 10 years ago, and they let you race if you have a seatbelt, (or not if your rig was made before 63 or so), and have a $10 bill for admittance for an hour.  I just called the LC airport to see if they'll let me use a runway for an afternoon. :)  That's really the only option I have if I want to keep it off the streets.  I got that idea from Top Gear.  They race on aeroport tarmac, so maybe I can too?  IDFK?  Worth a shot though.  I saw a jetcar explode, and a stock car race.  Watching a high speed collision live is a hell of a lot different than on TV.  I saw that car flip 5 times and land on it's wheels.  The crowd was silent as a grave.  I wanted to see cars go fast, not have a wreck and get towed out after the EMT's and the fire truck came out and made sure the dude was alive.  O.o  I didn't have enough balls to get on the track after seeing that.  **EDIT:**  And now you know why I get into street drags on occasion, but after seeing a couple of videos on this forum, I don't want to do that anymore because even if I was Dale Earnhardt, shit happens.  I remember that race too.  I want to keep it off of the street.   Life.  It doesn't matter if you're a billionaire without any heirs when you die.   Marry an asian chick, and have fun for like ever.  I could introduce her to t-bone steaks, mashed potatos, and corn on the cob, and greenbeans, and keystone ice.  She could introduce me to whatever they eat over there, and we'd have fun, and go hiking at the butte, and go fishing, and generally have fun.   I'm not one anymore, but in my youth I did a lot of shit.  * Keep your car locked, most thefts are opprotunistic crimes.  * Take your keys with you, and roll up your windows.  I never took a rig without easy access to it.  (1998 camaros haul ass BTW)  * Make sure you have a secondary ignition interlock, even if they have a screwdriver and a a hammer, it's not going to do much good if they can't find the secondary ignition switch.  * Surprisingly enough, a push button and a ignition toggle lever.  Most thieves (well kids), want to have a good time, and not jack your rig.  They won't be able to figure it out, and will leave you alone even if they do gain access.  * keep your rig clean on the interior.  Messy car = easy target.  Nobody's really going to notice if I'm driving a broken down ford that looks like a rolling trash can with a broken ignition switch.   I'm in pullman WA, and feeling "the need for speed again", but I'm too old to get into a street drag, (and I don't really want to spin out of control and kill somebody).  Anybody know of any closed roads around, or a track?   Do you know if there is a track around here?  I'm feeling "the need for speed", but I'm too old to get into a street drag.    Do you know if there is a track around here?  I'm feeling "the need for speed", but I'm too old to get into a street drag.    Either VGH or R-Tech systems.  Both places know what the hell they are doing.  They have parts.  I went to R-tech back in 2005 because I didn't have a spare MB and processor, so I took it to them.  6 hour turn around time.  I was impressed, so I let them fix it.  Oh, if you tell them not to touch a HDD, they'll physically disconnect it so you don't have to worry about being spotted for being a movie pirate with over 500G of film. :)   I ... um ... what? O.o  I'm confused.   We have exactly 1 sit down resturant with asian food in town, and it sucks pretty bad.  I mean besides Tokyo Seoul.  I'm not even sure what they're trying to pass themselves off as.   Because I want to try some asian food, and I think the local one resturant is shit, so I'm hoping that I could introduce them to Tbones and mashed potatoes, and corn on the cob, and green beans, and they can introduce me to hot shit that is good from wherever they're from.  When I say "recent", i mean within the last 10 years.  Not so far away that they don't remember how to cook good shit, but not so recent that no english.   I guess I should has specified asians that are recent immigrants and live within 5 miles of my house.  White chicks are ok too, but I like asians better.   well, I already have that nailed down.  Do they like a specific look in mind, or is it a crap shoot?      7.5" of glory, or my body shape.  I'm 5'8", and exactly 130.0 lbs   I like that body shape.  If you were around me, you wouldn't need one of those. :)   Be naked in front of a mirror while gently fellating myself, tenderly fingering my hole, and softly weeping while whispering "I love you dad".   You have two bumholes?  Or do you mean one in your mouth, and one in your bum?   Being naked in front of a mirror while gently fellating myself, tenderly fingering my hole, and softly weeping.   Sony.  I like them.  Yes, I have a sony of my owny. and can turn it up to 11. :)   Well, I'm a man, so record it.  I'd be a medical mystery and a wonder to science.   Suck my own dick.  /r/autofellatio    I wish I had a high horse, and a camaro too, and free cable TV, (well, I sort of have that because tools), and a reliable truck, and an owned house, and somebody who wasn't to busy for me even as an adult, and a chick too.  "If all wishes were horses, all beggars would ride."     No kid should ever have to utter the words that "daddy is too busy, he flew off to Detroit, and I'm living at home alone now for the next 3 weeks" when asked by the teacher  at 8 "Why didn't your dad come to the parent-teacher meeting?  Is something going on?"  I got a lot of free food those 3 weeks, and had a lot of chores to do but "I kept the hosue running", so I did a good job.         Yep.  Had the CSA not fired on Sumpter, it's likely that the USA would have just left and pulled the troops out.  It was a failed project from the start, but so was the USA prior to French intervention.  Had the British and French intervened on behalf of the CSA, history would have likely played out very differently, (and they almost did).   Yes they were.  They were also the first to institute the draft, and print "greenbacks" backed up by nothing, and to institute an income tax to fund the war effort, and rationing of goods to the civilian population.  They also had such a strict "defend the homeland" policy, that they rarely left their "territory".  Had they firebombed DC, they likely could have forced the north to come to terms of peace.  Sherman later did that to Atlanta in 1864-1865 during his "march to the sea".    Preemptive strikes work, when done correctly.  Imagine the Union's reaction to WDC, NYC, Boston, and Phillidephia being razed to the ground.  It would have been humiliating to the northern efforts to contain the rebels, and likely would have worked.   Only because y'all fired on fort sumpter.  They were within 3 weeks of being starved out.  Had y'all not fired upon it, it's likely that you could have left, (and then failed).      You mean war of southern independence?  A civil war is where 2 or more factions are trying to control an existing government power.  If the war of southern independence was a civil war, so was the American revolution.  The difference is we won, and the south lost.  That's it.   I just think it's a symbol of a failed nationstate.  (because it is).  A failed revolution that had 13 "states", and couldn't fight for shit because they were so damned isolationist.  I wouldn't fly that flag, any more than I would fly the flag of the USSR.  It's gone folks.  At least the USSR existed for about 75 years.  The CSA was just piss in a windstorm.  When I see the confederate flag, I don't associate it with racism, I associate it with "somebody's mad that they lost".  Fuck, might as well flag of Yugoslavia for what the CSA flag represents.       Want a good movie that deals with this?  [The Man From Earth](http://www.hulu.com/watch/517822)  I give it PG13 rating.  Not because of violent bloody scenes, but because I don't think a 13yo or younger would understand it.  Adult situations.  It's one of the best movies I've ever watched.   I could probably do 1000 years.  Hell, I've already lost all the people I really cared about except for one, so why not?  I'd like to see how society evolves over the next millennia, that would be sort of cool actually.  Want a good movie that deals with this?

Adult situations.  It's one of the best movies I've ever watched.   I think I would rather just get my ass kicked than live with an eternity with .... literally nothing.  If I had my "bat belt" as my ex wife called it, I'd just pull out my gun and end it.  And it would be different than just not existing, because you're conscious the whole time and you can think of every waking moment.  Imagine looking out to see .... nothing. but you're fully conscious of it.  I'd be begging for my sidearm at that point, and I would only need 1 round.  **EDIT:**  You would go insane.  Look up sensory deprivation.  Most people can last about 72 hours from what I've researched.  I don't mean lock up, I mean total sensory deprivation.  That is the ultimate form of torture.  At least I've practiced for sucking dick by deep throating hot dogs.  (Yes, I know that's super gay, [esp when doing it in front of my dad and he questioned my sexuality]).   Until that one day that the last proton decays, and there's nothing left but you,  Alone, in the universe.  Everything ceases to exist outside of quantum particles, but you continue to live  .... forever ... with nothing to see or experience, or do.  Imagine being locked in your room as a kid when getting punished with no TV or radio or power.  Now make it last forever.  But there's no bed to lay in and cry, no walls, no floor.  Just nothing, and ... more of nothing.  Then it never ends  because it's .... forever.  Terrifying prospect to be left alone for ever with literally nothing but your thoughts.   [It's a chameleon.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmcA9LIIXWw) You get it by coming and going, and stringing people along like in your golden dreams. :D   Can you imagine that?  "The Last Perfect Day", and then it gets hotter, the sun gets brighter, and then it becomes insufferably hot, and then all of the organic matter around you starts wilting and dying off, then spontaneous combustion becomes a very real thing, then the world literally catches fire., then the atmosphere is blown off into space, and all of the water on the planet.  Plate techtonics break down because the surface is molten, and the planet it turned into a ball of molten rock, and then completly engulfed by the Sun, and vaporised.    The only trace of the Earth left would be a slightly higher iron and sulphur and sodium content in the sun.  Then the sun collapses, and earth is gone forever, (and venus and mercury).  Mars would likely survive as a burnt out husk like mercury is today, and the rest of the planets would be unaffected.  I think I would rather just shoot myself.   Want to be alive when the sun engulfs the Earth in about 5 billion years, want to live to see the sun get so large that the atmosphere is blown away into the vacuum of space, the oceans boil off, and the mountains melt? Then the sun expands, and engulfs the earth, only to vaporize it? And you get to see it all? Living to see everything you ever known, cared about, and ever seen, just engulfed and obliterated by the dying sun?  How about in a googolplex years, when the very atomic structure of the Universe ceases to exist.  Not even electrons would exist, and the only thing existing would be some photons, some quantum particles and you?  Alone, forever, in a universe with nothing, and you still live on.  That would be hell, knowing that the entire universe you know and are familiar with is obliterated, but you keep on living on ..... forever.  I think I would rather eat a bullet than see that. I take solace knowing I will never exist to see that day. The thought of eternal life is far more terrifying than knowing that yes, one day, I just stop existing.    I wish ... I'd live forever  Really?  Want to be alive when the sun engulfs the Earth in about 5 billion years, want to live to see the sun get so large that the atmosphere is blown away into the vacuum of space, the oceans boil off, and the mountains melt?  Then the sun expands, and engulfs the earth, only to vaporize it?  And you get to see it all?  Living to see everything you ever known, cared about, and ever seen, just engulfed by the dying sun?    I think I would rather eat a bullet than see that.  I take solace knowing I will never exist to see that day.  The thought of eternal life is far more terrifying than knowing that yes, one day, I just stop existing.   We all die.  Shit happens.  It's unavoidable.  It's nothing to be feared, after I die, I won't even exist, so why fear what I can't feel, sense, taste, or touch?  Might as well feat the Space Jews stealing all the moon money.  It just makes no sense to fear death.  Hell, my house could collapse on me right now and crush me under a couple of hundreds of tonnes right now.  The USSR could launch now, and vaporise me in 45m.  Why fear what I can't control?  To put a reverse on an old country song, it's not the thought of being dead, it's the thought of dying that is sort of frightening.  If the soviets launch, well, I won't feel a damned thing.  I'll just be non-existent one millisecond.  If my house collapses for some reason, I might be trapped for several days before expiring.  I think I would rather die in a thermonuclear explosion.   Handjobs and blowjobs seem to get the highest reviews. :)   I ... don't even know how that works.  I think you got it backwards there dude.  O.o   Called out behind the pump house and beat so bad that I couldn't move.  Yeah, getting "behind the woodshed" is a very real thing in rural communities.  And then getting punched because you're crying like a little bitch, and told not to tell anybody or it will only be worse, and shaking because you're crying so hard and just want it to stop.  Yay childhood, I guess.  I'd slap me, but I think that was completely uncalled for.   That was the first time I was let loose on my own with a tank and a torch.  I got told to "go burn weeds", so I did.  I ended up burning a lot more than the weeds in the ditch.  I fucked up.  I admit it.  Thanks for making me cringe and reflexively cower down for 2s, dad. :(  You try costing the ranch $1.4M, and lost wages for your men for 2 years.   I **think** I had a good reason to get my ass kicked.  I cost the ranch almost 2 years of working salary.  Never give your kid a blowtorch, EVER.  Esp one hooked up to a 5ga propane tank, and you cost the ranch quite a bit of money.  Explosions aren't fun when you're running from it resulting a fire that you were told to start. O.o   Yes, it was, that's why I got hit.  We lost 3 cattle and one combine.  All because "Hey, let's let a 14 year old kid have a blowtorch and put him on weed control in late august".  Yeah, I fucked up, but the should have never handed me the blowtorch in the first place.  I wouldn't give my daughter a blowtorch with a propane tank and say "go kill weeds".  Why did they?    I started a field fire because I was trying to burn off some weeds, and it got out of control. That was a $1.4M loss to the ranch. I deserved it.  3 cattle, and one combine were lost in that fire, (and a couple hundred acres of wheat).  I fucked up.  Yeah!  Let's trust a 14 year old kid with a blow torch in late august.  That's a good idea!  (not)   I started a field fire because I was trying to burn off some weeds, and it got out of control.  That was a $1.4M loss to the ranch.  I deserved it.         Incest, or pedophiles.   Star Wars is just a rip off of Star Trek.   So why believe the bible?      Which is why it should be reinstated, but specifically targeted to prevent incompetent people from voting.  Race should not be an issue.  Black people are just people like you and I.  Hell, for all I know you're black,  I honestly don't give a shit about race at all.  However, incompetent people should be prohibited from voting.   I know.  It has probably happened.  I'm not against competency tests, but they should be in English at a 12th grade level of comprehension.  The Voting Rights Act of 1965 had good intentions, (prohibiting discrimination based upon race as a requisite to voting), but it had the unintended consequences of "Let idiots vote too!".  Did you know that now, a completely illiterate down's syndrome person has as much sway in national politics as you and I?  I'd be for in favor of repealing the 26th amendment, and returning the voting age to 21 years of age.   I'm familiar with that joke, (that isn't to far off).  A black man walks into the sheriff's office to register to vote in Alabama.  He goes to pass the literacy test.  The Sheriff says "Can I help you son?"  The black man says "Yes sir, I came to pass my literacy test to vote."  The sheriff hands him a newspaper in Chinese, and asks the black man "Can you read that?"  The black man looks at the paper and sadly states, "Yes sir, I can.  It says here that "No niggers going to vote in this county."  He turns and walks out the door after setting down the paper on the sheriff's desk.   Yes.  A person should need to pass a US Citizenship test before being allowed to vote.  If you don't know how your government works, I honestly think you deserve no say in how it is run.  *"An educated citizenry is a vital requisite for our survival as a free people."*  **--Thomas Jefferson: Papers and Biographies Collection**   Human trafficking. That is a fucking horrible crime, and the perpetrators should be shot in the face.         Only 32 years old, but my "best gift" that I ever got was a meal that I didn't have to cook.  It was from my step mom, and I was mind boggled that she even thought of that.  I know she knows that I don't like cooking, but that was nice.  I wasn't expecting it at all.   I'm 32.  Nope.  I should have been in vegas by now, with a paid off house and a 3 year old paid for truck.   Not be such a pillock in my HS years, and end up married to my HS crush.  Also, not drop out of school after 9/11, and refuse to re-enroll in college.  Not drink and drive, avoid debt like the plague.   Rand Paul. I hate the Democratic party. They should all get in a bus and move to the USSR.   The Hanson brothers.   I didn't have my truck with me, so I "stole" the buggy.  If I had my truck on my store run, I wouldn't have kiped it in the first place.  Or do you mean on the way back?  Because I didn't think of it?  "buggies have wheels, so I can tow it" is all I was thinking.   Since there's no "Ask a PO" thread, do you like looking at dude's junk while giving a UA, or is it part of the job?  And why back in 2008 was I told to disarm before going into the can?  If I wanted to shoot you, I wouldn't wait until the can to do it.   It's not a good idea to shoot automatic weaponry from the road into the field because you're testing it.  Do it from your own land where it's safe.   Nope.  I don't even have a functional door bell.  Knock.      Get naked in front of a mirror, gently fellate yourself, while tenderly fingering your hole, and softly weep.    I was listening to the scanner, and I heard, "We found 191 shells, but no clue where they came from"  I heard radio chat about trying to find the guy, (me), but "we can't pin it down, there's no other reports of FA fire countywide".  Me and my dad kept quiet.   We saw the SWAT van come and leave, and stayed up just watching them roll on by.  All because somebody in a 98 Camaro called the cops om me. (according to the scanner).  Needless to say, I got the fuck out of dodge.   I honestly think bill said "fuck it", because for something that I don't know why that the red and blues were turned on.  I honestly don't know why he was getting stopped.  But he outran it, and after hiding a while, we just went home.  He also rolled up on me for firing a AKS on a rural road.  Umm, oops.  He just lectured me about not discharging my rifle on public roads, and I might want to leave now because the sheriff was coming over in a SWAT van to investigate reports of FA fire.  I left.  Fuck this.  They didn't find anything. :D  I guess getting reports of some dude standing in the middle of the road waving cars by and firing into a field doesn't go over too well. O.o  **EDIT:**  I had a police scanner at the time.   A man is a man as far as I'm concerned.  Want to be gay?  More power to you. I honestly couldn't care less.  It makes no difference to me (other than more chicks for me).  So how did it come to represent the "homosexual movement", and not just "I don't care what race/color/sex/sexual orientation you are".   Nope. I haven't smoked for like 5 weeks now.  Pot isn't that great. (yay for being legal in WA, I guess?)   I honestly don't give a shit if you're not gay for me.  Just like I wouldn't some random chick hitting on me, I don't want dudes to either.  You like men?  I honestly don't care.  But I don't think I'll fly that flag ever, because people might get the wrong idea why I'm flying it.  I would only fly it to signify "I don't care", not because I'm gay.   Maybe.  I've seen Alaskan State Troopers, yeah, he always gets caught, but it is conceivable that they would be able to find a way out.   My dad told me about his adventures in the 70's, and he seemed to get away quite a lot.  He ouran bill once when I was with him. (we had 4wd, he didn't so my dad took off across the fields and got away).  I thought it was cool when I was 13.  We parked next to a diesel truck in some random barn and waited for 45 min. :)  We got out no problems. :)  He even went to the extent of following the tracks, and keeping in them so it looked like the truck made it.  We hid in the rafters.   So cops basically walk behind somebody the same reason I do?  (self preservation, and I can GTFO of the way if shit goes down)   So why did the cop follow me to my car the one time that I got mixed up with a prowler, and he wanted me to show him my rigs?  It made no sense, but I complied.  He wanted to see what I owned, so I showed him.  I didn't get it.  I actually said "these are keys, it's not a knife or a gun or anything".  That was the strangest encounter ever.  I didn't even know why they thought I was a prowler.  I was just sitting on my porch drinking beer and listening to my radio.  I was confused why they even looked at me, (and why I had to show them my rigs).   I know that, I don't let anybody behind me for that reason, but why not next to the side, and walk next to them on the opposite side where you carry your sidearm/knife?  ( I assume LEO carries a knife, because I do).   I honestly don't care if you're gay.  I like chicks, you like dudes.  Yay!  More women for me! :D  But why fly a flag at all, instead of simply not giving a shit?  I'm straight, and I know that not all chicks want to fuck me, or get down on her knees and suck me off.  Why are gays regarded as any different?   But wouldn't that give the dude they are following an advantage?  What's to stop him from just running and dive into nearby bushes?   Why not next to their side?  Wouldn't that give a better tactical advantage if they decided to run or whatever?   I guess I should have specified "homosexual".   If that's the case, why not fly it to say "I don't care whether you're black or asian, or gay.  I don't give a shit"?  Instead of it being exclusive to the "gay movement"?  If I flew a rainbow flag, people wouldn't think "I accept diversity in population", they would think I'm gay.      I kiped a buggy, because I had to walk home 2 miles, and there's no way I'm going to haul 15 bags of groceries around with me.  Yes, I returned it the next day.  That had to be a sight to see me driving back with it.  A truck with a buggy hooked up to the hitch, and driving 35 to the store. :D  I bet whoever was behind me was wondering why I was towing a buggy. :D   When she's crushing your hand squeezing out the kid, do like you would with a man, and meet force with force.  As they squeeze tighter, you squeeze tighter.  Failure to do this will only give you a fucked up hand, and you're not going to hurt her.  I had to grip back on so tight that my fingers were turning white, but I was uninjured, (and so was she).  You're going to need a pretty strong grip.   I am a foot soldier in the English army in 1918.  TIFU by not taking the shot against Adolf Hitler.   Buy a better car, instead of blowing $1300 on a sound system for a $100 car.  That was fucking dumb.   The propensity to kill each other over stupid imaginary friends.   Yes, as a matter of fact, it does. Congratulations, time traveler.   And the Sun is orbiting the galactic center.   Eternal edging.   Ur dad.   Just be understanding.  Boys can be bullied by girls, and even 14 years later, it has cascading effects even in my daily life.  Why else do you think that I'm 32, and only got married because I knocked the chick up, and have only "dated" 3 times in my whole life?  I'm still borderline afraid of females.   I was a teen in the 90's.  My dad was a teen in the 60's, and graduated HS in 1972.  I graduated in 2001.   Well shit, so much for that idea.  I know it would be devastating to the developed world.  (how many carbureted cars are still on the road?)   History channel, or Discovery?   "Eh?"   Hence the preliminary HEMP strike. Detonate it about 50 miles up, and bye-bye power in the DPRK. No electric power means no retaliation. Unfortunately, it would take out ROK too, and part of Russia and China too.      Just think, 90's music is played on classic rock stations. For today's teens, the 90's are as far away as the 70s were for me. Vietnam is as far away from them today, as WWII was for me.   Nuke Pyongyang, after a HEMP.   Supernatural = above nature.    So by definition, nobody has.   Somehow she found me on somewhere, and I'm still honestly afraid of her.  I'm a  32 year old man for fuck sakes, and I'm still afraid.  She doesn't hit anymore (except her kids), but I did meet her twice.  I'm still afraid.  I feel like It's the 90's all over again.      Drink my cat's medicine.  (actually, that would probably make me puke).      "I love you mommy."   CRT TV's    TPP  It's already passed.  It's on the president's desk awaiting signature.  http://www.cbsnews.com/news/senate-passes-fast-track-trade-bill/   Limp Biscuit, and a friendly game of "Who's dick is in my mouth?"   I'd get an artificial dick.   Own a bucket.   Or more bluntly, "One man's junk is another man's treasure."   That's really gay.     The hind lick maneuver.   I don't. I own a truck.   dog damn it. :(   I'm serious.  Cars run over cigarette butts, what's so hard to understand about that?   I've been driving on the family ranch since I was 11 years old, and my dad even let me use his low ride.  So since 1994.  I pulled up to my grandpa's the first time, and he said "Does your dad know you're using his rig?  Is he going to hit you?"  I said "nope, he just said don't take it off the ranch, and I'm not.  He won't hit me if I don't take it on the public roads".  My grandpa just said "OK, be careful, and don't wreck!"  But he didn't care after that.  He knew I would show up in my dad's low ride 1972 Chevy Luv with a 3 speed tranny. :)   Oh hell no.  I throw it out, as in the middle of the street where cars will run over it, so not a problem anymore.  The cars will put it out for me, and smash it into little bits.  No litter.   Whenever you ride a dyke, always wear a condom.  You may prevent a life.      Correct.  WWII would have likely never happened.  (or at around 1960 between the USSR and USA, but it would have been conventional since the atomic bomb would have not been developed in this ATL).  But if the USA remained COMPLETELY neutral in WWI, both the USA and USSR would have likely remained isolationist, so we might still be referring to WWI as "The Great War".    Fuck, I feel like I'm on /r/HistoryWhatIf   Actually, I think it was US Intervention in WWI that caused WWII.  Had the USA honored both the german blockade of the UK, and UK's blockade of mainland Europe, (no trade at all, we completely stay out), WWII would have been completely avoided.         No shit, use a dash mount, and have it direct wired using one of those tape adapters, and just use it like a stereo.  That's how I have my phone set up when I do use it as a jukebox.  But I only change the station when I'm stopped, (or waiting at a red light).   You're actually right.  http://www.bisociety.org/texting-while-driving-vs-drunk-driving-which-is-more-dangerous/   I just call that "putting out a cigarette where something flammable might be".  Other than that, I'll just crush it under my boot, or throw it out, (if I know there's no flammable material around)   Assist in station to station calls, collect calls, emergency disconnect of a phone in use so you can call them, get you to dispatch before 911 existed, look up phone numbers for you, authorize payphones by listening for the "bong" sound of a dime or quarter being dropped in, etc.   WWII might have never happened, if only Henry Tandy took that shot in WWI.   /r/politics would be sucking LBJ's crippled dick.   I was driving legally in 1999.   How the hell do you field strip a cigarette butt?   Money.   Walmart, Amazon, Big Smoke.   Because of bad grandma.   People who cruise along in the left lane. KEEP RIGHT EXCEPT TO PASS! It's not only courtesy, it's the law!   DOW Chemical, and Dupont.   Shaniqua, Keenzel, Kacey (for a dude), Andrina, Dawn, Shawn (for a dude), Monique.   What if the ride is 50 minutes, and the passengers are a car-pool of workers just trying to go to work, calling their boss because of traffic?  Should the vehicle have to come to a complete stop before they can make any call, and force them to either come in late, or be tardy because they can't pull back into traffic safely?  16 year olds work, eh?   That would infringe on the passenger's convenience to make a call.  They aren't driving.   Yes, but if "disabled after a certain speed/below an age" were implemented, how does the system know?  I was 15 when I placed that call.   And hyponatremia.   Wouldn't work.  What if the passenger needs to make a call?  What if, like in 1998 when I was coming up the lewiston hill, somebody coming the other way down flashes his lights at you because you think there is a cop ahead, so you slow down; then you come around a corner and A VEHICLE IS HEADING RIGHT FOR YOU ON A DIVIDED HIGHWAY!   I cut off a semi, and picked up on my phone, and called 911 to let them know about it, then got on my CB (chan 9), and let "ALL HEADING SOUTHBOUND ON US 95!  ALL HEADING SOUTHBOUND ON US 95!  THERE IS A LARGE VEHICLE HEADING NORTH IN THE SOUTHBOUND LANES ON THE LEWISTON HILL!  I REPEAT!  THERE IS A LARGE VEHICLE HEADING IN THE SOUTHBOUND LANES TO NORTH!  DIVIDED HIGHWAY!!"    Within 10s of my call, I could hear the sirens behind me.  That was a legitimate emergency, so you bet your fucking ass I'm using my phone and CB!  Yes, I missed him by less that 30 feet.  That was fucking scary.  Had it not been for my phone and radio, who knows how large that accident would have been.  Technologically prohibiting cell phone use in a moving vehicle isn't a solution, education is.   I came across it, and I had to turn it off.  My wife was texting and driving with me in the car.  If she was my daughter, I would have taken her damned phone and thrown it out the window.  I made my wife watch it.  She went white at the head on scene, and started crying at the kid asking mommy and daddy to wake up, and almost puked at the dead baby scene.  I'm thinking about taking her to a wrecking yard and seeing in person what happens when you text and drive.  Somebody in HS did that to me when she heard I was racing on busy public streets.  I got drug out to her truck, and she forced me to actually open up the vehicle and take a look inside.  She then shoved my head in and "smell that?  That's death.  That's what you're causing by racing on US195!  Keep up what you're doing, and you're going to be smelling this!  You will be the cause! This vehicle was going 131 on US195!  Do you want to see who they hit?"  All I could say was "no." and sounded like a child that just got beat by his mom.  I was crying at that point, and she drug me back to her truck and we went back to school.  I never raced on the highway again.  (I'll race on empty ones, but not that one, it's just too busy, and I might kill somebody).  There's nothing like the smell of curdled blood and some hair and skull to remind you DON'T RACE ON OPEN ROADS!.  I got hit after she heard about that, and I deserved it.  **TL;DR:** DON'T RACE!  DON'T TEXT AND DRIVE!   You asked for it (NSFW)  "I want mommy and daddy to wake up!"  How do you like seeing dead babies?   Since you asked:    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0LCmStIw9E      Roasting off the line with implicit intent.  http://apps.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=46.61.400  http://pnwriders.com/threads/acceleration.143619/  In some states, it's "Exhibition of Horsepower"   "What happens in this house stays in this house.

Alcoholics under going DT's experience tactile hallucinations, (and meth heads)  "ants crawling under my skin".  That would be a tactile hallucination.   Have you ever heard of Schizophrenia? They "hear voices that don't seem to be there in person".  That is an auditory hallucination.   Yes.  Look up auditory hallucinations, and tactile hallucinations.  You can even "taste sounds".  Look up synesthesia.    No, because of that's what the Several United States of America are called.  (before that, we had the Articles of Confederation.  The constitution was ratified in 1791).   I don't think physical operators exist outside of calling (area code) 555-1212.  (I think the kids call it 411).  I know what they used to do, but I don't think they exist anymore.   Like I was her own kid.  She was raising me since I was 2yo, and I would rather run to my step mom than my birth mom for help.  My sister and I were the only kids "she ever had".  She got pregnant in 1998 because she wanted a "kid of her own", but changed her mind 6 weeks into it, because "I already have kids".    My birth mother is fucking useless, but my step mom stepped in several times in grade school and raised hell because I was coming home with marks on me.  She told my dad to stop sending me over to joe's house because he would beat me.  My step mom basically **WAS** my mother, and did all of the things moms do, and dad did what dads do.    My birth-mother was a negligent parent, and had no reason to even have me for once a week until I was 7.  Although I call her by her first name, she's "mom" to me.  There are billions of people called "mom", or "mum", but only one XXXXX in my mind.  So I call her by her first name, (and have all my life), as a sign of respect.  She only slapped me twice.   No.  Their visual cortex has not developed sight, and wouldn't know how to process it.  All of the other hallucinations would still be there.   Not to mention the extermination of life sustaining heat from emergency camp fires, and landslides and sink holes.   My father made me pay my own insurance.  Because I used to be hell on wheels in my 1977 Chevrolet Impala Coupe, (that I dropped a 350 in with dual quads, Yay 4MPG!) I had so many speeding tickets, and "Excessive display of horsepower" tickets that I paid $169/mo in insurance, and had a probationary license.  (I was getting stopped about once every 3 months).  I rolled my car when I was 14 years old, (been driving on the family ranch since 12), and got into my head on collision at 16 years old.   And accidental burns, and most kitchen accidents, and slips, trips, and falls in both the workplace and home.   That explains it!  Thanks! :)   And it can be directly linked to hypothermia, and hypothermia.   And also if you're broke down along the highway, they'll change your tire, or give you a gallon of gas, or give you a ride into town.  I know police have utility beyond speeders (or dui busts), on the highway, but I'm asking about how they used to monitor speed before radar guns existed.   Everybody who has ever consumed dihydrogen monoxide is now dead, or will die.  Everybody who doesn't consume dihydrogen monoxide, is either dead, or will be dead within 4 days.   Back in 2000 in my home town, a family of 3 was killed because a teenager was fucking with his radio.  The chick looked down for 2 seconds, and smashed through a 93 Geo Metro at 60.   LOL! :D  I was driving an 1989 Ford Mustang LX at the time. :D   Only when nobody is around though.  It's not like I do it in rush hour traffic, or even if I can see one car around.  (except when in an emergency, but then I blare my horn, and turn on my 4 ways, and go directly to the hospital).   So, did they just drive around in circles all day, or??  How would this work?  Did they just go after vehicles that looked like they might be speeding?   I live in a duplex.  I have 3 bedrooms, and 2 baths.  I have 2 designated parking spots, and W/S/G included with the rent.  I use one of the bedrooms for a shop, and the other bedroom is completly empty.  I even keep the door shut to that room, and the vent is shut off in that room.  I have 2 floors.  The bedrooms (and 1 bath), are upstairs; and the living room, "dining room" (that I just use to make my living room bigger), kitchen, laundry room, and small downstairs bathroom are located downstairs.  I live in what would be classified as a semi-urban area.  I'm on College hill in Pullman WA.      1040 square feet.  I'm living by myself here with my cat.  I used to have a wife and a SIL that lived with me.  But I'm divorced now, and my Ex-SIL moved in with my Ex-wife.   "No daddy! Not my bum bum bum!"  "shhh billy let your daddy do his job"  gags you with his hand, and silently pumps away  "You like that Billy, don't you?"  forces your head to make the "yes" motion, and goes faster and puts a cowboy hat on your head  "WOO"  Slaps your ass with the side of his pillock and gives you a mushroom print on your ass, then kisses you on the cheek, and goes even faster pumping away  "WOO!"  You just got raped by Rick Flair, and he's your dad. :D      Yes, I used to be a racer.  	200
 What the hell does Mouthwash really even do then, if not to substitute brushing for those inconvient days?   Only problem I see with this clarification, great job on that btw, is that Blacks are not the only ones not getting their 'food'. Let's not pretend for one second that only black minorities are the only victims in society. 'All lives matter' to me means that, sure blacks are at a disadvantage to a certain extent but so are muslims (who probably have it worse in the USA), sikhs, Latinos, and any other minority that don't even have prominent leaders within the culture or the ability to come together and address problems they face in society. They all get swept under the rug which I can't stand to see.   You ever get the really dry shits that just won't be easily wiped and you just keeping going in to wipe and there is always some shit to be wiped. Next thing you know you, you've been sitting on the toilet wiping for 30 mintues.   I wouldn't say I'm religious per-say, but I do believe there is a 'God' (physical being or not) in some form or fashion. Isn't it crazy that we as humans, planets, and universe exist. I mean the universe had to have spawned from something, right? (God or Big Bang) But, how did that something come into existence for it create the universe? and it just becomes a vicious cycle that is impossible to fathom. We are something from nothing...literally, which defies any and all laws of this world that I know of. Truly, mind-blasting that a relatively new-born species can even have the cognitive ability to recognize or contemplate it's own world's creation and stem away from the programmed 'Eat, Survive, Procreate' that all animals have.   I'm not Christian, so I'm not informed on this topic, but weren't Adam and Eve the only ones alive where ever they lived. First two humans, allegedly. Were there millions of people during this time?    Got to get them AR points any way I can.   I would explain myself but I was traumatized after watching it and have since forgot the premise but I do remember thinking that the story was either poorly put together or non-existent.

Not to mention that the instrumental, especially the piano backbone is so powerful even on its own.   Captain Underpants was pretty good in my young adult days...maybe some Junnie B Jones.   1984   I just want to be given reddit gold one time. That is why I come back.   The Star Wars Prequels. Never been the same since.   Files will be declassified in 2017!   Confirm Half-Life 3   Just throw the word quantum in the sentence a few times and people will zone out immediately.

 That Jesus loves me   Charlie's illiteracy in It's Always Sunny In Philadelphia    When you are also a black woman   Nat Geo Wild is amazing, I wish they would do a full week of animal fight night! You guys need to check that show out, they don't skimp out on blood or anything and show animals and their battles in the wild. Sorry I comma splice and run-on.   I mean I like playing League with my friends more than I do solo, but it's not my passion.   Still enough money in the sport to be an alternative to anything else where the rewards are immediate   Not necessarily, I don't even know how you'd even begin to measure that.  Benoit Assou Ekotto is a professional footballer (soccer player; just for clairification) that doesn't like playing at all. He once showed up to the stadium on game day and asked his coach who they were playing! [Playing for the money excerpt](http://www.theguardian.com/football/2010/may/01/benoit-assou-ekotto-tottenham-hotspur)   Damn, I'm living around ATL and I totally missed out. Love listening to some of their morning show stuff on my way to work.   You're right, 6 months was more a less arbitrary time I picked to denote that the present sucks. I'm not even a fan of the animals, I'd actually be happy if I didn't have to see them. It's just better than all this drama and misused power   /r/retiredgifs    God damn I just want the reddit of 6 months ago!! The reddit where I didn't have to see Ellen pap everywhere, or news of how Bernie sanders now manages to have 7 voters instead of 6! I want a reddit where the most infuriating thing I saw on it was an overflow of cute animal pics on the front page. Oh how reddit is pulling out all the stops to fuck themselves over. I feel like /r/pinkfloyd needs a contingency plan for when everything goes tits up. Because this is a really good niche community and it'd be a shame if we lost it.   lol nerds dont get hip lingo   Instead he kept it exclusively for his own women and people!   yeah but who wants to link their facebook?   Idk, but I found that to be a major pain in the ass as well. My buddy just got back into League, hes level 23, and we couldn't duo bot at first because he didn't really own an support champs. Until he bought cheap Alistar   Ahh I see, it's more or less an interpretation of policies/models that favor or facilitate the more wealthy? That's a general observation, but your definition was good, and makes me look at it in a different light. Thanks.   Nien needs to work on those high fives, holy hell   POUNDS SCHILLINGS AND PENCE! Perfect Sense is one of the highlights from an already amazing album   Can you point me to any papers or readings on supply-side economics and this so-called trickle down economics. I have a very brief knowledge of these ideas and you know your shit. So any recommendations of yours would be appreciated.   Short team, because everyone is saying tall, and i'm rooting for the little lads. Although that small of a goalie would be like watching women's world cup   Unless there's a point to be made, I'm always interested in learning something new about PF   Speak for yourself, you're the one walking along the roadside   Pretty much any song by Pearl Jam, and English is my native tongue   For me, this song has the 2nd best guitar solo in the whole album, behind Comfortably Numb of course. It can be debated obviously, but I love it.   Animals is the beginnings of prog rock, i dont see much if any psychedelics in it, maybe if you could reference a moment that'd be great. And The Wall is in a genre of its own in my opinion.   They have like 2/15 albums that could be considered psychedelic idk what he was talking about   Psychedelic? Maybe early on, I'd be hard pressed to call OBC, Animals,  DSotM, WYWH, Meddle, AHM, TFC, The Wall, TDB, and TER psychedelic    Endless River - Pink Floyd   Downvoted after reading #1, take this blatant childishness elsewhere. Not saying there's anything wrong with smoking, but what the hell is this post?         Yeah I know exactly what you mean. I get the same feeling too. I think it's getting more attention than it deserves in some respects too.   I mean they aren't banning it per se. Just not hanging it in front of the capitol building, which I think is the right call. If some redneck wants to put it on the back of his lifted F-150, so be it. I don't believe in censorship in most cases, and I don't see this as censorship.   No reason to believe. This leads me to Occam's Razor. The simplest solution is usually the correct solution. There's nothing I experience day-to-day that leads me to believe that one exists.   I understand why people make the argument to keep it. But the current fact is that the confederate flag was a flag of another country. It's like states still hanging the union jack flag. (This point was made by Glenn Beck and I think this is a good analogy) In the flag's current state, for me at least, it holds the connotation of racism, but that could be my misinterpretation.   It was on the sidebar of the video. I also saw in another thread that she had a history of manic behavior and was found with 4 different drugs in her system.         It freaked me out but then I watched the video explaining what someone thought really happened and it no longer seemed to give me the chills.   These are some of the moments that get all of your guys' adrenaline pumping and ready to take on the world. I have no idea what I would have done. Any of you have weapons?   What a bunch of idiots   That's also very surprising. If the young people of reddit didn't know any better, they'd think Bernie is the front runner. From what I've seen though, it seems like a lot of redditors are helping people wise up to Bernie.   Well when there's so many GOP candidates, it's no surprise really. How many voters actually know what half of the candidates stand for?   What? It seems like the article is taking the opportunity to turn this tragedy into a political attack.  The overblown title is attention grabbing and biased as well. Fuckin NYT.   I apologize, you didn't deserve that response brother. Just the inner Libertarian in me having to read the insatiable bone cone for Bernie Sanders news on reddit gets on my nerves. All your points are fair points and aren't that far fetched at all. Take it easy.   Delusional person  that /u/titsalmighty just mentioned   ayo aye   Marina and the Diamonds   They should also say when you get demoted so we can all laugh at that person   Listen to starlight    I like this one even more! I've experienced this multiple times, awesome!   Hmm. I've read Lord of the Flies and it didn't seem to have the same profound effect on me that others experience.   Very good points. There's a lot of get rich quick or dieting or business books that are meant as cash cows. I've never read Dune, always seemed very daunting.   Samuel L. Jackson in Pulp Fiction   My buddy was super smart and had a bunch of honors society medals. So I took them after he walked and wore them. I also had a soccer medal I won in 5th grade and a wrestling medal I got when I was 7. I also managed to get a cord from the Baseball team because they made their own.  EDIT: I forgot to mention that my picture was in the newspaper with all the medals on   How has it changed your day-to-day philosophy or lifestyle? What were you like before you read it?   Yeah but the moon is so slow that I thought maybe the oxygen bar would be worth it at this point. But you're right :'(   Their first two albums are more rock/grunge material. Not sure if you've heard those albums or not.   I don't agree with older Muse, but nothing off their 3 most recent albums is all that great. What stuff of theirs have you heard?   Don't go for The Wall, if Dark Side isn't your cup of tea, don't go to that album. I'm a huge fan of PF and I think that album isn't very accessible. The Division Bell is very listenable to as a casual fan.   Sufjan Stevens   Jealousy   Someone please take this thread down. No good discussion is going to come from it. Just incessant blabbering that people have heard a million times and are desensitizing the issue. I'm not saying we shouldn't talk about it, just this isn't the right forum.   I reset then bought the Oxygen bar upgrade and now I'm left with 330 million investors approx. and I've experience that it actually just set me back.

I'll take my audacious curve and accept my 76.   God is real.   Two of the most impressive vocal PF performances of all time on one song. Roger's voice synthesizing with the saxophone seamlessly, and then the mind-blowing scream. Best song on TFC.   Sounds like you're using the voting system correctly   Admittedly I have plenty more that I haven't been able to listen to yet like Jaime xx among others.   So far:  * Joywave - How Do You Feel Now? * Twentyone Pilots - Blurryface -- probably my fan boy in me talking * Noel Gallagher - Chasing Yesterday * Brandon Flowers - The Desired Effect * Lone Bellow - Then Came The Morning * Houndmouth - Little Neon Limelight * The Magic Whip - Blur * Modest Mouse - Strangers To Ourselves  There may be others that I'm missing. What's your list look like?   I'll do the same if Mata scores against us   One of the few things I distinctly remember from the book. I had to read it for a critical analysis in HS, and was like WTF did i just read?    Spotify does have it's own radio feature akin to Pandora, albeit not as diverse, in my opinion. However, every Tuesday Spotify has most of the albums that are released available to listen to. And you can search through all the new releases and play an album to see if it's something you like. Also when you search a band, there are generally 5 artists on the side bar that are "recommended".   And if you don't like the radio stations. Spotify has entire playlists too that you can listen to. For instance, instead of an alternative rock station like Pandora, you can listen to a playlist instead. In the playlist you can see all the songs included and play them when you want.  Also it's so much easier on spotify to keep track of all the songs you've favorited and add them to playlists to revisit later   Sometimes I ramble and don't get my point across, let me know if I confused ya at all.   Our split into a separate faction on the pink Floyd subreddit has been initialized.   I don't think I voted for part 3, but I definitely would have before part 2 if that's of any condolence.      I was one of the five! *high fives the other four newly crowned best friends of mine*   Thanks for the advice with gadgets, also luckily I'm still young enough and in school so I'm still on my parents health insurance which is great.   Hmmm... This is very interesting, anywhere I can go to learn more? I don't want to go balls deep into something that I'm extremely nave to. Especially since I'd more than likely have to provide financial information to invest.   I would like recommendations with gadgets, modifications to cars, or anything that can pretty much improve my quality of life without costing all that much. Preferably nothing more expensive than $100 or $200.   How can you even tell what's not modified by effects? Like is that shit on her head actually there??? No fuckin clue m8   Haha best response!   Comfortably Numb by Pink Floyd  Or  Danger Zone by Kenny Loggins   I appreciate it man   Yes this is perfect! Thanks so much! Can you link the thread too?     I've searched this subreddit but unfortunately could not find it, so this is the only reason I'm making a post like this on here. So sorry if this isn't the most appropriate way to approach this, but I could really use the help.   There was this craft/project done by a fellow redditor that did some type of wood burning onto a blank piece of wood that was the cover of Animals. It was amazing and I was going to have my girlfriend do one for me, but I couldn't find the post. The original post included links to a DIY website as well.   Thanks to anyone that is album to help me!   Russell Crowe baby   Coincidentally listened to this today! One of the best songs on the album!   And then there are the days that get no comments. I got you track 8, nothin constructive however.   We are all witnesses, and I have no idea what I just fuckin witnessed. Holy shit, and then that Shumpert 3, talk about setting the tone.   	91
 The sliding rings clip to the headstall of the bridle.  The stationary rings are where the reins attach.  In my case, my top rein clips to the ring and the bottom rein runs through the ring and back to the saddle.   Wow, thank you!  That Bowman bit is the closest I've seen.  I'll send the link to my trainer and see if she'd like to get it.   I did look up Indian bits, but didn't find anything that similar.  :/  And as for the rust -- I'm sure that's part of it, but he really likes the fact that it's just a big straight bar and not jointed in any way.  If I could show him in it I would!   Hmm, I looked on ebay with no luck.  The Indian bits seem to be similar only because they have the extra rings.  I looked up thorn bits, but no dice there either -- many of them have crazy looking spiked ports.  The only one I've ever found close to it was in this bit collection on ebay:  http://i.imgur.com/ewAftSx.jpg  The third one down is very much the same, except with a slow twist instead of the ribs. I wish I could have afforded it.   My barn owns this bit and my horse is obsessed with it, as are many other horses in training.  It's his happy bit -- he works well in it, loves it, and we use it on him whenever its appropriate.  However, we only have one. My trainer pulled it out of some "big rusty bargain bin of bits" years ago and we have NO idea where to get another!    Does anyone know what this kind of bit is called?  Has anyone ever seen one?  Do any of you own one?  It's a big 'ol mystery to us!      Well, just from this vector, I know I like you and would probably try to ask you out.  What does that say about good design?     P.S. I was hoping you were a Redditor so I could tell you that!    You are my hero!  Everyone I show the sign loves it.  My friends in Madison, my aunt in Atlanta, my mom in Illinois -- it's just the kind of humor we need when it's going to be this cold.      Uptown Theater, Minneapolis, MN.  They're a funny bunch.      Hello again friends, OP here.  Some of you have asked for a better description of her skills and so I've uploaded her resume for public viewing.  I did black out her name and address for now, so if anyone wants to contact her, simply PM me.  Again, many thanks to you all.    https://www.dropbox.com/s/9cenx75tkrkwhko/JK_RESUME.pdf   Ladies and gents, my good friend finds herself without a job after this holiday season, and is having problems finding something new due to an odd looking resume.  In short -- after some medical issues took her out of the workplace for several years, she decided to become a horse trainer, which she did for several more years, until now.  Basically, she has an odd blank spot in her resume that employers don't like, and even after applying to 65+ jobs, has nothing to show for it.    Preferences include some kind of receptionist/administrative assistant job, something in a law office, etc.  Really though, retail, sales, or whatever would work at this point.  Part time would be ok.  Things are going to get tough for her if she doesn't find anything soon and I don't know how else to help her than put the word out on here.  I can send a resume to anyone who is interested, or thinks their employer might be hiring.  She is smart and easy to like, and also hysterically funny.  If I could offer her a job I would, but I'm just not in that position right now.  Thanks Reddit, you're the best.   Single?  OP is a hottie.  Though, that dog does look pretty awesome.  I would go out with either of them.     This is so sexy.   Why was she born in the fall?  I always associate baby animals with being born in the spring.  Or perhaps you're in Australia?   Forearms + glasses + beardface + farmer + excellent user name.  Yes please!   Not sure on the footing, but usually it's a mixture of tanbark and sand and dirt.  The green color is traditional for this show and is made from dying woodchips.    So since this class is all about speed (while maintaining a correct frame) it's a combination of pushing your horse forward while bringing him back a bit to get him to collect.  For most of these ponies, they want to GO GO GO!  When I have shown them, you don't cluck much to move them on, you just stop telling them to slow down!  And you have to slow down in those tight corners as well, and lean into them so you don't flip the cart.  So yes, you can hear the driver's voice telling the pony to slow down, and then as they call for faster and faster speeds, she says less and just lets him fly!   Conformation and manners also plays into the judging, as well as head carriage and correct motion of the gait.  I'd love to show one again -- so fun!   The first couple minutes is them walking to the ring -- which gets a bit long, but being with them as they charge down the ramp into the ring is incredible!  I've shown these ponies before, and they are an absolute delight.      Voted for Mr. Oliver!   I sponsored you!  All the best!   I made my eyes burn also.  Glad I'm not the only one.   So is that stuff basically made of cancer?   I had that cup!   This is why I only have pictures of my horse's nose!   My friends and I are still trying to figure out what the hell nipple blades are.  It's a fantastic card to play though.    How in the world did he get up there?   This sounds like a fantastic idea.  I just graduated, so I'm not a rec member right now because I'm not currently paying student services fees, but I could get a membership.  As for the other side of the deal, I can teach you cooking no problem, and could also help with men's fashion!  If only I had access to a horse, I could teach you to ride too!  PM me and let's talk.   BAHAHAHAHAHAHA!  I feel like if I ever jumped my horse, this is how he would do it.     I even read that last bit in a sped up commercial announcer voice.  Uncanny sir.   Wow, quick response, and a good answer!  I had no idea so much went into it, though I'm not surprised it's so complex.  I am not a natural redhead, but I have heard about things related to redheads and anesthesia.  At the time I had both surgeries, I wasn't on any medications at all.  Though it is interesting that you mention Klonopin, because I've been taking that for the past couple years now.  If I need to go under again and am still on the Klonopin, maybe I'll be easier to handle. :)   How do you determine how much anesthesia to give a patient?  I've been put under twice, and they've commented both times about how hard I was to "knock out".  As in, I think they had to give me more anesthesia than they thought.  Does it have to do with a person's age?  Size?  I'm 27, female, and 120 lbs at 5'3".  Just wondering why I've been compared to "trying to take down a rhino."  Lol.   Love the Borlaug one!  I like to see him included in this grand company.   How awesome at biking do we need to be?  I just got a new bike that I've been riding every chance I get, but I'm still woefully out of shape, especially up hills.  Oh god, the hills.   What a total doll.  I wish my horse would chill out and do this, but he gets too excited and wiggles all over!     I too would like to know more about this meetup!    So jealous of this barn/cabin!   I wanted to go for a hack too when I was in London and went here: http://www.wvstables.com/  It was FANTASTIC!  Absolutely top notch.  We rode out on the green and went cantering through a forest.  You also get to ride through town and they had horse crosswalks!  All the horses were well trained and in good shape, the trainers/owners were nice and knowledgeable.  Cannot recommend this place enough!   Watch the lip sync battle between John Krasinski and Jimmy Fallon.  First of all, hilarious.  Second of all, sexy.  It's about 8 minutes, but it's so worth it to watch the whole thing!  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EnsjrDsVyI   He is a complete doll!  I love his markings.   That sounds fantastic!  I've really been overwhelmed by the number of people who have reached out to me.  I feel so welcomed already!  I'm eager to get to know the city.  I really love places that are little holes in the wall, so maybe you can show me some lesser known, but still awesome places to eat, drink, and hang out.  I'll let you know when I hit town!  - Nicole   Thanks for dropping me a PM!  I'll let you know when I hit town.  I've honestly been overwhelmed by the number of responses I've gotten.  It would be great to meet up and swap Minneapolis stories!  - Nicole   Thanks for the quick reply!  It's nice to know that meeting people will be quite easy.  I am INCREDIBLY social, so I hope I'll find some quality people to hang out with soon after I move, assuming I even have time to do that!  If I have any questions I'll let you know.  I've already gotten a couple responses from my post and it hasn't even been an hour!  I think moving to Madison will be just fine, and it's nice to have Redditors on my side. :)     Holy crap Dan, that was a fast reply!  I may indeed be up for dinner with your and your ladyfriend.  I'll be living in what I think is Near East (right by Olbrich).  I'm a very social person and like having a large group of friends that enjoy doing things on a fairly regular basis.  Generally, I'm up for most things.  Going out, staying in, having potlucks/grilling out, going to museums/concerts/.    I bit about me, I suppose.  I'm a 27 year old female currently living in Minneapolis and finishing my Master's thesis in Landscape Architecture.  The job at Olbrich is just a stop-gap internship while I find work in a design firm.  That job may be in Madison (if I fall in love with the place and there is work), or I may be moving in the fall to one of the coasts in hopes of getting a job out there.  I will also be continuing my job for the University of Minnesota as the copyeditor of the Landscape Journal, which will keep me a bit busy, at least for the summer.  I really appreciate you writing back so quickly!  The next few weeks are going to be tough as I uproot myself from the safety of graduate school and the friends I have made over the last 9 years of living in Minneapolis.  However, as we all know, change is necessary, and I sincerely hope the best is yet to come in my life!  I'll be in touch,     Nicole     Greetings Madison!  I'll be moving to your fine city in about a month.  This marks my terrifying transition from graduate school up here in Minneapolis to the "real world", where people are married, have babies, and don't have time for new friends.  I know a few folks in Madison, but they are all married, or insanely busy, or both.  No babies though...yet.  WHO ARE YOU PEOPLE?  Where should I go to meet up with some lovely, intelligent folks?  I see you have some bar meetups, and I plan on hanging out at coffeeshops, concerts, and the like, but how do you really meet people?  I'll be working at an internship at Olbrich Gardens, but as I'm the oldest intern by quite a few years, I don't think I'll be making many friends there with whom I would like to spend time outside of work.    Anyways, let me know if you have some ideas.  PM me if you'd like to introduce yourself!  I'd love to get to know a few folks before I move, as this transition is proving to be particularly anxiety producing.  However, let it be known, I'm just coming out of a relationship and won't be looking for a "romantic connection" right off the bat.  See you all in a month!   Methinks this belongs on r/ladyboners.   That dress is gorgeous.    I currently live almost directly behind Matt's and have only been there twice in 9 years.  I think you're fine. :)   You should NOT be getting downvoted!  A helmet is a must for any beginning rider, and in my opinion, every rider.  15+ years of riding and I still wear one religiously.     Seeing him in concert in April!  I will have to resist pouncing him...    This is AMAZING!  In the picture where you have the purple streak in your hair and are wearing the grey coat, you are ADORABLE.  I want to squeeze you!!!  Great work -- I cannot imagine how much courage it would take to become who you know you really are.  You look fantastic.      I would like to see what is behind the camera!  And of course, the forearms are tasty.   You are not alone.  My crush for 10+ years.  Oh Jason...   	56
                                              took me til i hit 39 before i came out, i didnt want to hit 40 without being my real self. the only regret i had was that i didnt do it sooner                                                                                                                           well alrighty then                              oh, you mean the F-35A that the F-16 ran rings around? That F-35A?                                 i cant even imagine what it was like to come out in that day and age. or the 70's for that matter, or the 80's. 90's MAYBE. but the 60's?? dang.                                                yeah, i had all the feely feels and had to take a moment before i could post this.                                           yup, but not with australia  http://defensetech.org/2015/07/10/australian-navy-cancels-order-for-the-f-35b-joint-strike-fighter/   lmao, the f-35 is the most expensive boondoggle in history. at this point, it's the poster child for a solution in search of a problem, because it doesnt fit any role for any aircraft in the current theater of operations.   it may very well be a jack of all trades, but it is currently a master of none, so all the specialized aircraft currently deployed will run rings around it for their purpose.   gimme a warthog any day of the week.   except that the only test it has passed so far with flying colors is that it managed to take off and land vertically, so it's got that going for it. the rest of it? great on paper, in actual test flights...... not so much                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               	189
  When the sun rises in the west and sets in the east.  This line was best in Game Of Thrones   Game of Thrones RP   You are very new if you can not tell that this is not Balota...   That is a really great idea. Another cool feature of that, would be not only a logbook of your player, but of your character. So that every time you die, that log book would be reset. It would also be really awesome if you could read other character's log book after killing them.   **A Way for Fitting Weapons into Your Backpack**   nbsp;  Storing Weapons in your backpack can be a real big hassle due to the only way of storing it in there, is sideways. Although, if most of us were to store a weapon in a backpack in real life, we would do it facing up, right? So why not do that in DayZ. Make weapons take up the same amount of space, but let them face upwards. I thought of this because most weapons can not be stored in backpacks as the backpack's space in the inventory does not have a big enough width.   nbsp;  Thank you to anyone who reads this, and have a great day!   There is also quite an extreme amount of posts regarding 'Hackers', I believe there should just be a PSA that is stickied so that users know about the situation.   Do you have anything in the 'filter'   That is the same as me. I play quite a lot of DayZ on medium pop servers (Australian). The one I saw (Actually I did not see them, because they were in the Camo building wall glitch) my friends ran in to try and secure it, because we had a farming hoe. Then suddenly one of them loses their gear, then they get carpet bombed. Luckily I was on the hill outside. This happened at Veresnik.   Agreed. Although the problem with night time in DayZ and the way people use it, saddens me. It is night time it is supposed to be dark, why maximise your gamma for extra visibility? They add the gas-lantern, torch and chemlight for a reason.   I also want the Developers to focus on the multi-player and optimizing, but we probably will not see much optimizing until the final version.   Admins doing this would be way cooler.   It would be great if the admins also challenged the players, such as the admins being the heroes/bandits protecting the objective.   That would add a terrifying atmosphere to the game. Just imagine, your character looks at his watch (Please add devs) he sees the clock strike some time like (2:13 AM or 1:43AM) some time when it's dark. A gunshot is heard from out of nowhere, then a group of Bandits are running at you.   There would not be a linear story. You could side with Bandits and Heroes, maybe they would both have the same objective, but they would get there different ways. If eventually the devs let us learn their new scripting language and let us build custom mods for SA, I will learn and make this. You wouldn't even need to do the quests, you could just kill everyone and rule the land.   No, the bandits and heroes would be AI.    Of course. The objectives would be difficult and time consuming because you would get an approximate location of the items you are looking for, and those areas would be flooded with zombies or bandits/heroes.   "Singe player would be boring" That is an opinion. You wouldn't be forced to play Single player, it would only be a feature available within the game.   I didn't say that they would completely remove Multi-player. It would be an additional mode, where you get a single player character. This character wouldn't be available for use in Multi-player servers.      So after 140 hours of playing the Standalone, I still do not know how to solve this very simple problem. Whenever I am in the North West. (A lot of the time) I have this problem where my character is hungry and/or thirsty, yet my character is stuffed, this makes it difficult to keep energized and Hydrated. Any help is appreciated.  	20
    Nope, but it was similar. Younger presenter, still in HS. In some of the videos she is a Freshman in college. I think they are pretty recent.   Nope, it was a lot more professionally done, with a theme song, much higher rez video, and a lot longer.   It's one of the funniest things I've ever seen on YouTube - I want to show it to some friends but I can't remember what her name was. It was part of a series, she does makeup advice, study skills, etc. too (those obviously aren't as funny.)            Quite creative, you should turn this into a short story or novel!    "I sleep and breathe and bleed just as you do." Creepy stuff... I loved this documentary - by the end I half-believed in the Mothman. I think there really might have been some sort of chemical leak that caused mass hallucinations in the area.   To the moon baby! 'TopDoge   Click here if image not loading: http://imgdoge.com/img-52f55d921d2e0.html#QB4XvXOP05XGUMxO.16               And yet, some of us have multiple pieces of Bill the Cat merchandise. I don't know if that counts as a success or a failure...   Whichever one was assigned to the file to begin with. Let's assume I open iTunes and load song "foo" with ID number 12345. A line appears in iTunes called "foo," and behind the scenes, iTunes knows that when I click on that line, it opens file 12345.   I could then re-name the file "foo2" and move it to a different folder. It doesn't matter, all that does is change where *I* see the file. To iTunes it's still 12345 and it's still stored in the same place on the disk.   At that stage of development humans are totally obsolete. I'm talking about the intermediate stage where people who can't attain a very high level of skill are shut out of full-time labor markets.   They will probably try to find some niche that has not yet been automated, probably in personal services or some other kind of face-to-face interaction, or in making creative content for the internet. "odd jobs" like this might not provide a full-time income, but I can see people pursuing stuff like this in the future in order to get the extra stuff they might want. There will still be economic incentives, but no longer will there be economic devastation for those shut out of regular labor markets.   So are you saying that things could have been designed this way, but now it's too late because of the assumptions that programmers make about how files are stored?    What I was thinking was a system that gave each file a unique ID number, and *that's* what iTunes would look up. Putting it in a different folder would only change how it appears in the user interface, not where it actually is on the disk for iTunes to load. Same with changing the name of a file. It seems like it would be so simple.      I think most people will always want something "extra" - nicer apartment, newest video game system, etc. that will encourage work.   Give the poor just enough so they don't starve/riot is not socialism. It's just warehousing and we do a lot of that already.   Broke is better than dead buddy. Blue lips is a bad sign. Go to a free clinic in your area or an emergency room.   I didn't know he would keep his porn and random wedding pictures of this girl in the default "Music" folder on his computer  Sounds like he wanted to get caught.      Is there such a concept as malemployment in economics as there is with malinvestment? That is, reducing UI might lead to a lower unemployment rate but a higher malemployment rate - people working in jobs that are not close to the economic optimum because they feel forced to take the first thing that comes along.   Underemployment doesn't quite get at what I'm thinking about here because someone could be underemployed just because there are no jobs equal to his or her level of training, whereas malemployment would be more of a search problem for those jobs that do exist. The difference between the two would sort of be like the difference between a liquidity and a solvency problem at a bank.   And the UK hopes no one finds out the reason Iran turned into such a freak was because he and the US teamed up and stole all his stuff in Middle School.   If OBE's represent physically real phenomena, they should be relatively easy to test. Just put some random objects in a locked room and have someone who is out-of-body float over and take a look at them. Very simple and very scientific. Monroe claimed to have a technology that could reliably produce OBE's.  However, he seemed far more interested in cataloging scads of "other realms" and altered states which he numbered like Focus 1-100 and encounters with alien beings that were completely unverifiable. It is interesting stuff and might very well represent real *inner* experiences (that is, I don't think Monroe was just making stuff up - he was a wealthy man before starting his paranormal research), but he was not a proper scientist.    Yikes, I would not call Monroe scientific. He's good reading though - a modern Swedenborg.    It took me two whole years to make good friends at college, but once I did I made two lifelong friends that I would not give up for anything. Keep your head up and don't give up - your college friends are out there, you will find them if you stay true to yourself.   I beg to differ. I liked the future tech tree and the space/sea expansion - added a whole new dimension to the civ experience. I wasted much time in college with CTP.   Don't do what, kill yourself or get married??   If you really are contemplating suicide, please seek help. Killing yourself at 25 because of relationship issues is not the right solution - trust me, I've been there and at the same age too. Several years later I am now married (though no kids yet!) - so keep your head up, it does get better!!   Or the bathroom was where the bomb was hidden. Alert /r/conspiracy    Lovely sentiments, until you realize that Rutherford is a pro-privatization outfit that helped to fund "Waiting for Superman."   Good points. I would say that this willingness to "go under" is what stays out of the cycling and is the part that is done with the cycles.   Nietzsche would probably be horrified at the "dialectical" interpretation that you just gave his work, but that's not a bad place to start. However the bermensch is in some sense "done with" that cycling you describe (although it continues in a transformed way under his gaze.)     Happy birthday thanks for getting me hooked on Italian rap music.      The two are not mutually exclusive. There were many occult-oriented Christians in the Nazi Party, and yes there were some outright pagans too. Himmler and Hesse to name the two most prominent. Himmler advised his SS officers to have sex in graveyards so their wives would give birth to the reincarnated souls of German warriors. I don't remember reading that in the Bible.   You might want to edit out the cat in the SS uniform before putting this on your slideshow...   What's that green area? The Aldi Neutral Zone?   Ok, I will attempt a real answer: That looks like reflex tearing, which can be a sign of dehydration. However, I have no idea why he'd be that dehydrated *before* the game even started. That would be really dangerous for an athlete.    Consider the fact that you might be feeling the same way had you made the opposite choices. The other woman might annoy you also. The safe job might make you feel bored and wish that you'd followed your passion instead. None of this is the end of the world or the end of your life - believe me, I've made some *terrible* choices in my life too - you can recover.   But... you can't be wishy-washy. Either commit to the woman you're with now or get out of the relationship. Either commit to grad school and being poor for a while or get into the family business now before you have family responsibilities of your own.   Haha, yeah, that's the step where I'm stuck too.      how'd this guy even get elected?  Six-way race - anything can happen! 22-way California governor recall election resulted in Governor Schwarzenegger. Jesse Ventura and Al Franken getting elected to high office, just blame that on Minnesota being weird (though Franken has turned out to be an excellent Senator.)    I agree - I am going to change how I present this in class this year and ditch the "two daughters" stuff.      Most great killers are also great romantics. Stalin wrote love poetry, as did Mao.            It does more than "stink," it will strangle the economy in the long run. Health care doesn't work as a market because prices are opaque, there is no time for price discovery anyway in an emergency, demand is almost completely inelastic, and there are no substitute goods (can't buy anything else if you're dead or incapacitated.)   If Obamacare fails companies are going to push more healthcare costs on to their workers or drop plans altogether, and then you really will see perceived disposable income start to fall, since most will consider health insurance a necessity. Consumer demand will take a big hit and the economy will suffer further.   True but to someone who doesn't know the technical economic definition of "capital," it does sound Orwellian.   I suppose the question then is are these health-care plans worth the money the insurance companies are charging employers? Wages are fungible, health care plans are not.   Even if a worker is being "compensated" more that he realizes with a health-care plan, how much of the value of that plan ever flows to the worker, and how much is captured in excess profits by the medical industry which benefits from endemic market failure in the health care sector?   In the introduction to de Voto's "The Course of Empire," there is a very strange and poetic paragraph about the Age of Exploration attributed to an "Emery Heywood." I figured he was a writer or a historian and his writing style was so unique I decided to look him up to see what else he wrote. I can find no trace of any writer or historian by that name on the Internet.   Does anyone here know who this person was and what his (or her?) connection to de Voto was? I am quite curious now...      Read "Before the Storm" excellent book about Goldwater - he enticed Southern evangelicals into voting Republican by opposing Civil Rights in the 60's. Later, he regretted what he had done and even began to call himself a liberal - but it was too late.                  True, but not all creative train wrecks are so bizarre. I could see a "postmodern" Cop Rock where half the show was behind-the-scenes "reality" footage being strangely entertaining.  Plus, Broadway spinoff...      Cop Rock lasted eleven episodes before it was yanked for good in December 1990and it went out in its own inimitably weird metatextual style, with everyone breaking characterI cant believe they cancelled us, one cop says. Yeah, I know, I only got to sing one song, another respondsand crewmembers coming out from behind the scenes to join the cast in one final number.  Please, please, bring this show back. They're re-making Ironside so why not??               You can respond, you just can't vote on them I think.   Going through all the old threads I saved and never had time to read   He would also know how to spell Colombia      That's like just your opinion maaaaaaaan   Since OP has disappeared, I assume one is the UK. There are now govt-subsidized mortgages around 1% there now. They're basically paying you to buy a house.          we know a person will become unable to function after ~48 hrs of wakefulness  How is this changed by drugs like Provigil, which (supposedly) allow you to stay awake for five days with normal functioning?      Haha, this is uplifting news, no wishing death on the elderly.   If you look at the age breakdown you'll see why. It's 96% among people under 30.         Interesting your experience was so different from mine. Probably because I was not really looking at the face at all - I usually looked down so as to better concentrate on what was being said - to me looking at the face was distracting!   Believe me, people notice, they just don't say anything. I was in college before I knew that I didn't do this. My roommate was the kind of blunt person who would point out stuff like that, but afterwards when I asked other people they confirmed that I didn't make eye contact, they just never mentioned it, assuming I was shy or whatever, but honestly I'm not that shy it's just not something I ever thought to do.   There were a few groups that split off from Catholicism sooner than the Lutherans, but most were crushed militarily. A few are still around. The Lutherans were the first major group to split off from the Catholic church and not get largely killed off.   And what about monkey butlers? Inquiring minds want to know...      Low-status groups tend to be more aware of honor/respect issues than high-status ones, at least in my (modern) experience, just as someone with food insecurity is going to worry a lot more about the state of their fridge than someone who can just go to a restaurant if it breaks down.   Obviously in feudal times things were different and no I am not suggesting that all blacks are low-status, but there is a correlation.                  Yep, that's the big mystery. I would guess that mysterious exiles from neighboring societies would sometimes wander in. Sometimes they might have been seen as divine emissaries.    What is the difference between love and attachment in your opinion?   Very good point, thank you.   What do you think it means?   Very insightful, thank you!   I mostly agree. I do think there is an element of enclosure to the self, but it's not absolute - and that trying to make it absolute does cause a lot of (unnecessary) suffering.   Wow, awesome quote. I've never heard that one before thanks   Not so sure it's arbitrary. At least with the specific example you refer to (xenia), the Greek religion believed gods would travel disguised as humans, rewarding good hosts and punishing bad ones.   Of course this reflected/reinforced an underlying cultural attitude, but I don't think that just comes out of nowhere. Caring for a guest can be expensive, not to mention possibly dangerous. There must have been reasons why such customs arose despite these costs.    Not treating travelers well has been considered a very bad thing in a lot of older cultures because if you were unwelcoming to travelers, you may very well be sentencing them to death.   And because those travelers might have an army somewhere behind them! Mistreatment of merchants and diplomats sometimes got you a visit from Genghis Khan.   They are not registered anywhere, so we are assuming money is an appropriate gift. Thanks for the tips.   I don't believe in a "solid" self (atta), however I am not willing to give up the notion of a changeable, open-to-the-world self, even if suffering results. I agree totally with your last paragraph, very well put.   Al-Jazeera is not owned by oil companies, though it is supported by an oil-producing state. You could say the same thing then about Fox News Saudi ownership.   I've always liked what Al Gore said more than how he said it - he's always had a tin ear towards looking hypocritical or like a preachy high school principal.   No kidding. This is the first time I can ever remember it, in fact. Usually they just quietly fold when a better money-making scheme comes around, like Moral Majority and the Christian Coalition did.   I thought it was a dramatized portrayal, not a documentary. I have not seen it but I might go this weekend.   He said he'd go back to Sweden (not Switzerland), if they agreed not to extradite him to the US. They refused. One of the women making the accusations against him has known CIA connections. He is not even being charged with rape but with some other weird sort of sexual offense that doesn't even exist in most countries. Both women admit that they slept with him voluntarily.   I think that's a good approach but I'm not sure it's one a lot of Buddhists share - there is this idea that Nirvana is the end of *all* emotion, indeed all sensate experience period, and the release into some totally unfathomable realm.   Yeah, I've thought of that - NOT that I am claiming to be a bodhisattva!  I always thought the compassion and non-attachment sides of Buddhism were in conflict with each other. Compassion seems to all be about caring for others, and non-attachment seems to be about withdrawing from the world, including others.  Maybe it's a creative tension though. I can see how compassion can get people past their self-attachment, but that makes compassion instrumental (i.e. "I am only trying to feel for you in order to ease my own suffering"), and I'm not really comfortable with that.  But I am only a Level 1 Laser Lotus so I'm sure your insight is far more advanced!   I don't necessarily believe in some of the "mystical" aspects of Buddhism (cosmic Buddhas, reincarnation, siddhis, etc.), but I've been influenced by Buddhist philosophy since I was a young teenager. I meditate and admire Buddhist leaders and speakers.   However I've never called myself a Buddhist or even a "secular Buddhist" and recently I've realized my main "block" to the tradition is that I'm ok with suffering. If that's the price for loving the world and trying to build a self, I can accept that. To eliminate suffering by giving up that attachment to life seems like a bad deal to me.  Anyone else feel the same way?   I don't think that actually goes on a lot in the US. It is so easy to destroy someone's character image or reputation, you don't need to be blatant about it and actually kill them (see: Assange, others.) JFK himself is a different story since he had real power to change things, but I doubt any witnesses to the assassination were themselves assassinated. In any large group of people there will be strange deaths.  Extreme Republicans got themselves worked up thinking Hillary Clinton was offing dozens of people to cover up her shady real estate deals by basically going through the list of everyone she knew. Guess what? Some of them had died in weird ways... that doesn't mean she killed them, it means she was a politician who knew a ton of people.   No good. I'm sure that symbolizes loneliness.   I'm not so sure about that. That statement was made before she got a 4-6 year prison sentence. Her family believes it was suicide and she told a friend she would rather die than go back to jail. I would not be surprised if some compromised politician did her in, but the evidence does point to suicide.   It is one Japanese and an American ex-resident of Japan. Since the wedding doesn't appear to be involving any of the American's religious traditions, my sense is the Japanese side is going to predominate. A lot of people have said the even number of bills thing, which makes more sense - I think that's where the divisible by four nonsense got started.   Thanks for the advice!   Good point... $150 it is then.   Action-movie music in the background was laughable - still interested in seeing it though I will wait for the reviews.   Don't panic. This happened to me when the landlord lost the check then I went on vacation so I didn't get the late payment notice (they never bothered to call.) Since the rent has now been paid, there's no basis for the summons and it should be cancelled. The landlord has to call the court - and they will - if the landlord lets a case come before a judge when the issue has been resolved that is going to be one upset judge - he or she might even fine the landlord.   Beautiful, I feel the exact same way a lot of the time. I'm beginning to realize that I've had a lot of pain in my life, but I wouldn't trade the rawness you get from that pain for anything, it's made me who I am today.      Maybe someday. Since most members of Westboro are actually just the lead guy's family, it would probably take an epic family feud. If you leave his church you are cut off from all your family members as well.   There is not a charge for the reception. I guess I should have mentioned the wedding is going to be in the US, so some US and some Japanese traditions mixed, probably. $300 is a lot considering we are already spending about that much on travel. Thanks for the advice though.   Very good points, but there are examples of knights, or armies led by knights, suppressing peasant revolts in the Middle Ages. I can think of several in England and Germany. I guess you might defend that as a time when feudalism was breaking down - they all did occur in the Late Middle Ages, 1300- 1550 from what I can remember.    Sounds like "horsepucky" as my mom would say.. I don't think giving them $100 or $150 would be horribly offensive to their culture - but I thought I'd ask here just to make sure.         Online phone directories today are really powerful. They'll often not only give you multiple phone numbers for that person, but their address and (this shocked me when I used one the other day), people who they are associated with (don't know how the phone company gets that information, but whatever). Give it a shot.   Same here, just posted about the same thing. Keep your head up, I know how it feels.   Are you sure it wasn't a coyote? They make all kinds of weird sounds.               This should be for real life not just reddit   How long ago was this? In the past few years devices have been invented that are basically lasers for sound - they can direct sound at a particular target without anyone else around hearing it. Someone could have been pulling a prank on you.   What about Penguin? Wasn't he a demented aristocrat?   He's arrested a lot of the top generals and literally all of the admirals. Unless there are colonels willing to act independently, he probably doesn't have much to fear from the military.  On the other hand, colonel-led coups are not unknown in history...   It's like he actually wants to spur a revolution.  That might be exactly what he's doing. If he really does want to consolidate power, the chaos of a revolutionary situation might be his best bet. Of course, if you lose that bet you lose the country, but he might be willing to roll the dice.   I did not realize the Chinese had troops garrisoned in North Vietnam. How did the alliance go sour so fast that by 1979 they were at war?   I will check it out thanks for the links   I don't think NATO ever stopped fearing a Soviet invasion, right up until the fall of the Soviet Union. Also, I don't think it was ever proven that the more extreme actions of some Gladio groups were directed by NATO, or part of a coherent NATO strategy to undermine native communism in Western Europe. Most historians believe that a few of these groups decided to take matters into their own hands, or that Gladio recruited extreme rightists thinking they would follow orders, and they didn't.   I would distinguish between a honeypot and something like Gladio. A honeypot is a government agent or false group that poses as an extremist leader or oganization to attract followers, then the whole group is rounded up, since of course the leader knows who everyone is, etc.   Gladio was a covert stay-behind guerrilla force set up by NATO in preparation for a possible Soviet invasion. Unfortunately the kind of folks who are eager to join covert stay-behind guerrilla forces are not always the best-disciplined people on the planet, and several Gladio units started freelancing in organized crime and extreme right-wing activities, most notably in Italy and Turkey.      Personally I believe the EDL and Anjem Choudhry are both state honeypots to attract extremists.  I'd say that's crazy, but then I remember Hal Turner here in the US (Nazi radio host who was really working for the FBI), so who knows...   Or maybe Yaxley-Lennon just doesn't seem fascist enough...   I think that just means he is a gold member, not that he got gold for that particular post.                  Guilt about spending too much time on the Internet (created worlds) instead of with your girlfriend? Or maybe you are afraid of her mom? Just a guess. Sometimes dreams are just random and don't really mean anything, even intense ones.   I think you mean *only* one is confirmed? Anyway, I'm down the wiki rabbit hole again... goodbye Saturday      What are some that are still a mystery? I thought these had pretty much all been debunked or shown to be hoaxes.       I think he wasn't as drunk this time   Interesting. What did the professor think was going on with the phenomenon?      I realize this is a very broad question, but I've seen some pretty out-there claims being accepted uncritically by the media recently. Of course, tech breakthroughs do happen from time to time, so I'm not convinced these devices are scams either. I would like to know what a group of people inclined to be skeptical about extraordinary claims thinks about this issue.   Metaphysics simply means the search for a reason behind the laws of physics as they exist, it doesn't mean channelings and crystal healings.   If you posit rules, you still haven't reached an absolute nothingness. You still have to explain why those rules and not others, or no rules at all.   No time, no space, but there is a rule set. That's not a metaphysical "nothing," which would not imply a rule set.      "Nothing" turns out to be "Quantum Foam" with the laws of Quantum Mechanics already built in. Not exactly "nothing" in the philosophical sense. Quite disappointing. I would recommend "Why Does the World Exist?" as an alternative although it gets sort of wooly too at the end.         Explains why Imgur took over reddit...   Source: http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/David_Foster_Wallace   I draw the line at people who make demonstrably false claims about *this* reality (as opposed to possible other ones.) McKenna is on the acceptable side of the line for me, whereas guys like Drunvalo Melchizedek are on the other.       Unless you plan on living hundreds of trillions of years, apparently the answer is no.      I had a good experience, but I didn't come away feeling like I'd gone to the spirit world or anything. I will say that it's worth the money.  Interesting. You always hear about the breakthrough trips but I'd imagine there are a lot of people like you out there as well. What was your experience like and why do you think it was still worth the money even if it wasn't "as advertised"? (I'm thinking of going next summer...)            sorry about that   So they make you *do* crazy shit, not just *see* crazy shit? Yeah, no thanks, that's not what I'm after.

    it's a real sausage party in here   Thank you! My fridge could use some more Sounders swag though    It's delicious! I have to admit... The only sujuk I've had is the one I've made at home.   The jist of it is it's a basic beef blend with red wine, garlic, paprika, etc but I think the flavor you're referring to is fenugreek! It's super yummy and is that X factor is sausages usually.   it's all good! sausage casings do usually come from intestines which is why they have that shape so you weren't wrong  also you gotta start somewhere but don't be scared! cooking can be a lot of fun :)   you know it! I actually only lived in Seattle for a year but it's still a near and dear place in my heart    Sausage making is 2 basic steps: meat grinding + casing!  To make this recipe, I ground a blend of short rib and round meat to get a 70/30 fat ratio.  Using some hog casings I bought online, I then stretched the casings over my kitckenaid sausage stuffer attachment and then stuffed the blended meat in there!         no whammies no whammies no whammies   	10

Our 15yo daughter has had extremely sporadic and random periods.  The GYN prescribed her some birth control to take for 3-4 months to help regulate it.

The Confederate Flag is history for the Southern states. It represents state's rights in opposition of the federal government ignoring such rights.   I think the White Walker army will decimate a vast majority of Westeros.  Dany and her dragons will fly in and destroy the army.  A greatful Westeros will make her their queen. The End.   [Redacted]   Gotcha.  I understand the "tmed" abbreviation, but I came up with the phrase "medic-aided tanks" (read "medicated") which sounds more fun to me.  HAHA!   That's Pepto Lake on the island of Bismol.   Haha--yes indeed. Every layout I've done on my own was horrible. LOL   Living in a country with the freedoms we have, there isn't a cure-all that would stop mass shootings. To think otherwise is naive.

I'm HQ-16, Lvl-39; I wouldn't get one yet.   I had an arterial aneurysm in my left arm (near my armpit) at the age of two. I had it worked on, but they all said I would have more and probably not live past 16.  I am now 34, father of three, and have never had another aneurysm since.   Buy a brand-new Ford F-150 extended cab.   Not a great combination.  Ew.   Nooooo!  I use this to get res all the time.  Don't ditch it.   "Blackie" only tested well in the South.... hehehe...   "Brunettie" didn't test well.   What the hell are these kids doing?  GET TO CLASS!   I laughed out lout at the end.  HAHA!   You're welcome.  It's been so difficult keeping it from my wife this entire time.   No, not really.  What kept me there was the job security, the pay, and the benefits.  Way better than the Papa John's job I had before.   Well, he was stabbed, and didn't die... so... does that mean it **did** happen?   I am an electrical designer for an electrical engineer. We do consulting engineering, and are mostly hired by architects to design the electrical portions of projects (e.g., lighting, power, mechanical connections, special systems, etc.)  I was offered a job by my potential parents-in-law. I started off answering phones, and making deliveries. I moved up to simply drafting other people's mark-ups. Now I do the design on my own.  I have no EE degree nor PE stamp, but I could go back in the future to obtain them if I wish.   Make sure my house is paid off, bills paid off, private school and college funds created, and then give the rest to family.   No, you aren't. The other games were incredible without the Batmobile. Why make an already-excellent formula even more complicated?   I can't get over the fact that you abbreviated it "TLOR" instead of the standard "LOTR" that most people use.   No they didn't; that was stupid.   What game is that?   That a video representation of the term: "nerdgasm".   How do the other Kingsguard not know it's him...?  Seriously?  It's not like 8'-plus men are common.   I'd assume that was the entire point of the scene.  Are they about to support her or capture her.  To be continued...   Aaaaaaand it's gone.   It's been pointed out about 10 times since last night.   Didn't know Olly was gay...    I also think that Brienne (known for hesitation) didn't kill him.  But every media source is claiming he is dead.  We might be wrong again.   Easy--she'll send FrankenMountain to destroy them all.   I'm sure they were promised safety and rewards... neither of which Sauron would have granted.   A-fuckin'-men!   What's even worse, is that if you look at the actual painting, it's not as if you can see nipples or labia or anything.  The closest they get is half a butt-crack.

True, but the fact that there is even a debate over this blew my mind.  They have rinsed my mouth out at the dentist after a brushing, so I've always assumed it was supposed to be done.    ... if you rinse with water after brushing your teeth, then you are rinsing away the benefits that fluoride provides to your teeth.      But he's not racist, because I've been told several times that a minority CAN'T be racist.....    They need to say that on the Windows 10 Upgrade program that pops up in the sustem tray.   Because it says "FOR A YEAR" when it should say "The free upgrade is valid for a year. After the year is up, you will have to pay to upgrade."   I've yet to see costs for the upgrade after the first year is over. Also, what happens after the year is up? Is Windows still usable to some degree?   Any suggestions?      ...and no one cares.

 none - Sanders does, though   I'll believe a candidate who has a track record of being on the right side of issues their whole career, not one who is merely saying the right things at the right time to the right people.  Hillary's record has been one of siding with giant corporations.  Obama said a lot of things to please the ears of progressives during the primaries too.  People didn't pay attention when he was supporting telecom immunity (for spying) and Joe Lieberman over a progressive.           In the words of George W. Bush.  ["Uniquely American, idn't?  That is fantastic."](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kIjo-dWE1Jg )           These are deeply personal attacks and criminal accusations, and I think it's incorrect to immediately grant them credence because you disagree with ~~O'Reilly's~~ someone's political views.  True.  That is the kind of thing the right wing does.   Ah, thank you!   I have xfinity internet -- does that mean I can use the app too!?   Thanks for the pointers to Fandor and Mubi!  Exactly what I was looking for.   What do people do now when they get a hankering to watch any of the huge number of  popular flicks that aren't on streaming?  I can't bear shelling out to iTunes each time.  I brainstormed a bunch of favorite films, and then annotate which are available on Netflix streaming or not (I'm pretty sure most of these aren't available on Hulu/APV/Crackle):  * The Matrix (any of the trilogy)  - not available * Hidden Fortress  - not available * The Good the Bad and the Ugly - not available * Vertigo - not available * Sexy Beast - not available * Divorce Italian Style - not available * Lynch's Dune - not available * Fifth Element - **available** * The New World - not available * Birth - not available * Gosford Park - not available * Barry Lyndon - not available * The Royal Tenenbaums  - not available * Jurassic Park - not available * Lord of the Rings - not available  I honestly did this off the top of my head.   Just one film I could think of was available.  I'm one of the [10% that still has a Netflix DVD subscription](http://www.theguardian.com/media/2014/jul/22/netflix-dvds-mail-subscription ) for this reason.  How does everyone else do it?  Or is the answer that a lot of films simply just aren't seen anymore by the vast majority?   Why is it necessary to keep trade agreements secret from the American people including the staff of elected Senators and Congressmen?  Why are our elected representatives not allowed to review the details of TPP with experts?  **EDIT**: Obama will say that the details are not secret, but this is purposefully misleading language.  Senators and Congressmen are technically allowed to view the bill, however, only they may view it.  They may not even bring staff members or experts in with them into the secured room in which the agreement is kept.    The TPP is several thousand pages long, yet the only people who can view it, Congressmen and Senators,  may not take copies or even notes of what they read.  So Obama is saying that it is not "secret" in only the most narrow and technical sense.  He ought to be called out on this.  Why the need for this secrecy?  How can democracy work when the details can't be reviewed by experts?  Here are some good write ups of problems in TPP, based on leaks:  * The EFF documents a litany of digital rights issues https://www.eff.org/issues/tpp * Senator Warren and others have pointed out that the international court which the TPP establishes allows corporations to bring complaints that would effectively override domestic laws.  Unions, environmental groups and others would be excluded from using the court, however.  http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/kill-the-dispute-settlement-language-in-the-trans-pacific-partnership/2015/02/25/ec7705a2-bd1e-11e4-b274-e5209a3bc9a9_story.html  Please call his bullshit.   So take a look at this comment: http://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/356qkt/i_just_purchased_the_2012_macbook_pro_because_its/cr1vglo  How do you go about getting access to that content.  Every film I could think of wasn't available but one.   What do people do now when they get a hankering to watch any of the huge number of  popular flicks that aren't on streaming?  I can't bear shelling out to iTunes each time.  I'm going to brainstorm a bunch of favorite films, and then annotate which are available on Netflix streaming or not:  * The Matrix (any of the trilogy)  - not available * Hidden Fortress  - not available * The Good the Bad and the Ugly - not available * Vertigo - not available * Sexy Beast - not available * Divorce Italian Style - not available * Lynch's Dune - not available * Fifth Element - **available** * The New World - not available * Birth - not available * Gosford Park - not available * Barry Lyndon - not available * The Royal Tenenbaums  - not available * Jurassic Park - not available * Lord of the Rings - not available  I honestly did this off the top of my head.   Just one film I could think of was available.     That limits DVDs on their most fundamental level of "watching shit".  But my concern is the content.  Much of the streaming catalog is shit, by design of the movie industry.  They limit availability of a lot of the good stuff *on purpose*.  So DVD/BlueRay is the only way to get it.  People who rely only on streaming are either watching not very much or watching shit.  Obviously, I'd prefer a full catalog in streaming format.  And I agree with you about plastic discs - I can't bear keeping those things around. But I want to have access to a full catalog without feeling the pain of the purse each time I want to access something that isn't available on streaming (ie no to iTunes).  I'm just a bit surprised that more people don't feel this way.   So I'm a technology guy who has built a bunch of web and mobile systems over the years, I wrote a computer language, and am currently leading a team building a video ad marketplace.    That bit about DVDs not disappearing is taken a bit out of context.  I mean that the business interests provide a reason for DVDs to continue to exist, not that technology can't address the problem.  So the truth is I'm probably quite a bit more technically savvy than many of the people commenting here.  I'm kind of crazy about video, which is why I want access to any and all content.   I guess I'm a bit surprised that people are willing to accept technological limitations to what content they consume.     Thanks for that link.  Here's the bit that resonates with me:   As well as the option of a film night, of course, it's also nice to have a choice of films you actually want to watch. The paradox of Netflix's successful transformation from a DVD rental company to a streaming video firm is that as its star has risen, the selection has got worse. The company's switched its focus from film to TV, where the rights are cheaper and standards are lower (admit it, you'd never watch a film half as terrible as that reality show you binge-watch religiously). It has started making high-quality original series, in an effort to steal some of that HBO shine. And it's perennially fine-tuning its recommendations algorithms so that the more obscure films it can afford to license end up in front of the right people.  TL;DR I've seen most of the good stuff on streaming.  I'm not a technophobe, but I guess I am cheap (i.e., can't bear to rent on iTunes).   Interesting.  I'm really surprised by this.    So how do people get access to the full catalog of movies now?  I get like 3 DVDs a week from Netflix.  Do people just not watch as many movies now?  I guess the non-streaming catalog is effectively dead for most people?  Or do they spend a lot of money on iTunes?  At 3 movies a week, it seems like that would be quite expensive.  I mean there are tons of new releases that don't get onto streaming for *years*.    I understand now that I'm in a tiny minority, but I'm also still completely puzzled.  What is normal user behavior?   Three times a week.  I'm kind of surprised that people are satisfied with the Netflix Instant/Amazon Prime Catalog.  So little of what I want to see is available on those.   How do you get access to all the movies that aren't streaming?  Netflix Instant is a tiny catalog.   What is a TV?   I think Apple's decision to provide *no* new models with an integrated drive is terrible.  There is no remaining product (other than this soon to be discontinued line) which supports what I imagine must be a fairly common activity: watching Netflix DVDs on your laptop.    Using an external DVD drive doesn't cut it. The common situations for this: on an airplane, in a car, in bed make this a clumsy solution.   The other option - ripping the DVD - seems equally terrible.  One could argue that DVDs are going the way of the dinosaur, but I'd beg to differ.  The reason they still exist is not technological -- it's that way because of business interests.  Studios make money by limiting the availability of content.  DVD rental is an end-run around this lucrative system, so I find it hard to see how DVDs are going to disappear.  If you want a large catalog, you need easy access to DVDs.  Am I missing something?  Are there any good options?  **EDIT** "2012 Hardware", that is, according to the Apple rep I spoke to.   Looks pretty guilty to me.   Enforcement of contracts and protection of private property are a service provided by our justice system.  The people who benefit disproportionately are those who own property.  Protecting those "rights" is what allows a family like the Waltons to do very little work but extract the great majority of the value produced by their workers.     Free protection services for contracts and property - police, judges, the whole legal system - is an entitlement... one mostly enjoyed by the rich.   Yup   A true representative of the people of East Texas.   I did not realize that.  Thanks for clarifying.   Looks like Maddow is part of the Clinton inevitability crowd.    "Senator Sanders, let's talk about Hillary Clinton"     Please, please peel back a few layers and find fossils.   I think you're looking at it the wrong way.  If he were elected, he would have a massive mandate. *Despite* massive money arrayed against him, the people actually chose him.  Despite years of red-baiting propaganda, people became so sick of the cheating that modern capitalism represents, they chose a Socialist.  Such a tactic would embolden Democrats that there is another way.   As President, Sanders would essentially be the head of the Democratic party, and be able to support progressives over conserva-dems in elections (the opposite of what Obama has done the past several years).  As President, he'd have the bully pulpit to drive the conversation around issues that matter and speak plainly about the origins of our problems.  Conservadems like Obama took the energy of the left and turned it into disgust and cynicism.    But Hillary is willing to lie for the duration of the primaries, much like Obama did, and Wall Street has her back because they know she's lying, and we'll all accept that because --- apparently, she's "electable".   And thus does American politics continuously slide ever further rightward.   The lying Wall Street-serving harpie is electable.  Let's elect her.         Strange days indeed, a Democratic President who praised Reagan during his primaries and now signs a secret trade agreement that Democrats are against but Republicans are for.            Irish Wolf hound/German Shepherd?      Require mods of big public subreddits to win by election or find a way to get rid of mods.   Leonberger, right?  Jeez those things are cute.   That's what I'm talkin' about!   I think you're taking me too literally.   When do we start bombing Israel?   The perfect price of a movie ticket, from the consumer's perspective is $0.  And, that's not a ridiculous statement -- that is in fact the proposition that PopCornTime and internet bootlegs offer.     So the question is - why are they saying any price higher than that ?   They are likely not saying this is the *most* I'd be willing to pay (because movie ticket prices are much more than that and ... everyone goes to the movies at some point or another, right?).    Perhaps the consumers are thinking that it must cost *something* to make a movie, so they guess a price, but how are they in any position to know this?  The person who could have a meaningful opinion is someone who understands the finances of movie making.  They've just picked a number, which from a movie maker's viewpoint,  might be as ridiculous as saying "$0.01 is a good price for a ticket"?  In other words,  people are being asked to make decisions on something they can't make good decisions about.  So what exactly are we learning from this?    It's definitely fun - a classic thriller.  I wish I hadn't seen it so many times already :) !   Many great suggestions here, but some of my all time faves are missing.    Here are some I consider must-see films (on any list).  I think these each represent the greatest work by each of these directors:  1. Hidden Fortress (Kurosawa) - the inspiration for Star Wars. 2. Black Orpheus (Camus) 3. Contempt (Goddard) 4. Divorce Italian Style (Gremi) 5. The Seventh Seal (Bergman) 6. La Strada (Fellini)  I would have put Night of the Hunter up here, but someone already mentioned it.  And now some other fun ones, concentrating on things you may not have heard of:  7. The Game 8. Kwaidan - 3 incredibly beautiful Japanese horror stories 9. Sanjuro / Yojimbo (Kurosawa) - inspirations for Clint Eastwood's  "Man with No Name" classic films. 10. Seduced and Abandoned (Gremi) - if you enjoy Divorce Italian style 11. Spellbound (Hitchcock)      Keep in mind that Criterion isn't just a "great films" collection.  E.g., Armageddon.   Life is good for police in a police state.

Please bring on those self-driving cars.   I stopped paying attention to the Oscars in 2002.  The Best Picture nominees were A Beautiful Mind, Gosford Park, Moulin Rouge, Lord of the Rings and one other.  Somehow, through what I can only guess was a political campaign, Beautiful Mind, a feel-good and rather drab little drama won the award.  Does anyone remember that film or care about it now?      Level: maximum douchebag.    you can't abandon those you are protecting.  In what way are they abandoning multinational corporations?      "I'm not an idiot.  I'm just a liar."   Andrew will be King, not his father.   Lets remember that this nice old german lady whom the "commoners" choose to lavish with love is the world's top landowner in terms of space and value.  These monarchs managed to keep their title to vast lands by permitting a Parliament, but it only has power to the extent that it doesn't challenge the Royals' claims to their property.  It's a brilliant bargain - they get to continue having the same ownership that they enjoyed before "democracy" while also having the power to dismiss any of the peasants elected representatives.     It is actually illegal to even speak against these landowners.  In N Ireland, high treason (punishable by life imprisonment) includes the following offenses:  * attempting to deprive the monarchy of their title * publishing that the sovereign is a heretic, tyrant, infidel or usurper of the Crown * doing anything which might disturb or interrupt the sovereign's possession of the Crown  Yet the British peasantry have come to love them.   "Welcome to r/Politics".   It's incredible.  My non-GF wife is hooked.      I loved the style of the Lynch version, though it fell apart at the end.

Yet even this could be interpreted both ways.  From a conservative point of view, "Big Government" is the problem.  From a liberal point of view, "the state of government" (especially the Republican congress) is the problem.    The poll shows respondents naming "dissatisfaction with government" as one of the commonly named problems, which leaves me confused.  This is so terribly worded.  It's hard to know what is meant.  Are people saying that "prevalent feelings of dissatisfaction with government" are the problem?  Or are they saying that "an overreaching Big Government" is the problem?  Or are they saying that the dysfunction of government is a problem?     I realize this is a joke but I don't get it.  Why is this funny?

Israel has a sophisticated ethnic cleansing strategy.  Instead of a mass purge, which they know would draw worldwide condemnation that even the US could not ignore, they deprive segments of the population of basic necessities and human rights in focused doses.  The world pays less attention, but they have time on their side.  This is ethnic cleansing by attrition instead of by pogrom.  The effect is the same.   It has a little bit to do with who has disposable income and who pays whom to have careers in politics.   Thy Kingdom Comt   Conservatives write laws to prevent citizens from voting.

Did you click over to the book site? http://dividendsforall.net  It's absolutely insane to see Sarah Palin, Robert Reich, Bill O'Reilly, and Van Jones all praising the same book.   "Project triple douche"            Fair point.  (See my response to /u/DanzoFriend in this thread).  * https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOP2V_np2c0 * https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpOhqx2AGXg * https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpAMbpQ8J7g * https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6ZsXrzF8Cc * https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbp6umQT58A   I should be clear - the video does a very good job at explaining Weber's ideas.  I'm criticizing Weber.  His attack on Capitalism is highly interpretive, very much in the spirit of  early 20th century sociology.  Discovering the origins of Capitalism in Protestantism is speculative rather than critical and analytic.   There are better critiques Capitalism than this.  The argument went nowhere.   One of them did.  Her credit is ruined.    I know Dan and Mike and they're both great guys.  All of us think they're really swell guys too.   When pressed on whether their actions were moral, Michael Cosculluela replied: "There's no question of morality in business."  I mean, what's not to love about that, amirite?            Waiters and waitresses, you now know what to do when you see [this guy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thom_Tillis#mediaviewer/File:Thom_Tillis_official_portrait.jpg).   The problem is, once you go there, a lot of other things start to look permissible.    Yes... it doesn't make sense.  I'm reminded that Americans  poll as left wing progressives on core economic and social safety net issues, then vote for right wing politicians.  There's some kind of disconnect.     Agree, but in some places the numbers who want Sharia are also quite high (see this other chart from that article): http://www.pewforum.org/files/2013/04/gsi2-chp1-3.png  For example, in Egypt, 74% want Sharia, and 86% of those favor the death penalty for apostates - that's 63% of the population (!!!)   Some specific examples and quotes would help.  I literally cannot find any definitions of the sort you've given.  And then, there's the problem that the definition is vague.  You seem to be saying that some currencies are a function of the USD - so by pegged you actually mean "partially pegged".    Anyway, it's really impossible to discuss this further without specifics.  You said "almost all" currencies are pegged to the USD.  What is the specific definition of "pegged"?  (Not a reference to some author who wrote something somewhere at sometime).  And what *specifically* are the countries that fall under this definition?  I've asked several times, and all I'm getting is hand waving.      even when the polls show unambiguously that the majority support such barbarous things as the death penalty for apostasy.   Wow.  Do you have a link?  Edit: I just learned about Google.  http://www.pewforum.org/2013/04/30/the-worlds-muslims-religion-politics-society-beliefs-about-sharia/  And the very WTF result you mentioned: http://www.pewforum.org/files/2013/04/gsi2-chp1-9.png   I can't find anyone who uses the definition of pegging that you do.    Just because something is "pegged" to the dollar does not mean it is economically static.  Yes it does.  That's what pegging is.   http://money.howstuffworks.com/exchange-rate4.htm   A pegged, or fixed system, is one in which the exchange rate is set and artificially maintained by the government. The rate will be pegged to some other country's dollar, usually the U.S. dollar. **The rate will not fluctuate from day to day.**  http://financial-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Currency+peg  Importantly, fixed exchange rates do not change according to market conditions. It is also called a pegged exchange rate.   I think this says something different than you think it does.   This action, referred to as the Nixon shock, created the situation in which the United States dollar became a reserve currency used by many states.  Being a reserve currency is *entirely different* from being a reference currency.  While pegging requires reserves, having reserves does not entail pegging.    And the  bit you quote even says many previously fixed currencies  became free floating as a result of Bretton Woods, not the other way around.    Just about every currency in the world  Not true. It's mainly the oil-producing countries that do that: http://www.investmentfrontier.com/2013/02/19/investors-list-countries-with-fixed-currency-exchange-rates/   Bahrain,Jordan,Lebanon,Oman,Qatar,Saudi Arabia,United Arab Emirates,Venezuela, Hong Kong, Cuba, Panama, Eritrea, Djibouti, Bermuda   They're pegging their currencies to the dollar because the US has forced the world to buy oil in US dollars.  This boosts demand for the US dollar, increases its value and makes it more stable.    I don't reject the theory of low expectations, that's certainly a possibility, but I think other factors are at play too.  Saudi Arabia is worse on almost all human rights issues than other Islamic or Arab countries.  Even if low expectations mute criticism of Arab/Muslim countries, we'd expect the Saudis to at least get proportionately more criticism than Iran, Saddam Hussein's Iraq, and Syria.  So low expectations cannot be the whole answer.  I think the differentiator is the role of the press.  Saudi is largely kept out of the news because it is not in the interests of western officials to antagonize the dictatorship.  Official enemies like Iran, Saddam's Iraq and Syria are regularly castigated.  Journalists tell the stories of their leaders, and so the public in Britain and America hear bad things about our enemies, but not about the House of Saud, the unsurprising result of having a supine press which is largely reactive to the agendas of elites.  In Israel, the ongoing war has created a narrative independent of official western proclamations.  What is remarkable is that despite [western journalists'  biased coverage  in favor of Israel](http://timeswarp.org/testing-for-bias/ ) --- western populaces have seen through the ruse, perhaps because the obvious morality of the situation belies the official propaganda.  The house of Saud can hide their crimes as long as their land is untouched by strife.  Israel, unfortunately, has those pesky Palestinians it has stolen land from.   Saudi Arabia is allowed to do what it wants because the dictatorship has agreed to peg oil to the US dollar.  The deep relationships with elites in the US don't hurt either.      [This Annenberg study](http://repository.upenn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1070 context=asc_papers ) concludes that it is has a strong pro-Israel bias.  Here is a [summary](http://timeswarp.org/testing-for-bias/ ).   **EDIT**: funny, less than one minute after I submitted this, I get a downvote.  Oh but my fans sure are speedy readers! - - - - - -   But - did *you* see the movie?  You asked me, I gave you specific reasons.  You could have refuted them.  Had I ignored, you might conclude you're beating a "dead horse".  But you didn't.  Instead you ignored what I wrote and told me I "post nothing but left-wing stuff".  It's not clear how these non-sequitors are supposed to change anyone's views.    With regards to Frank Rich, and with my respect, I'd say that he's got an odd analysis of a critical issue.  Look at this passage:   I would hardly call this film an endorsement of that war; its an endorsement of the Americans who volunteered to fight it. If anything, Sniper is the very opposite of a recruiting poster for further American military adventures in the Middle East.   Rich is referring to PTSD issues and the horrors of war suffered by the soldiers. This certainly makes the film more interesting than most, but the deeper message is still reflexively pro-American.  American motives are always pure, and the suffering of the killers on our side is always noble.  American Sniper effectively glorifies the suffering of one of our sociopaths, and asks us to feel sympathy for him.  Indeed, Rich even acknowledges the relentlessly one sided perspective in the next sentence:   The Iraqis are xenophobically and all but uniformly presented as duplicitous, indistinguishable savages (in Kyles lingo) unworthy of American sacrifice.   Glorification of military members is a propaganda technique employed to put our military -- and by proxy our military adventures outside the reach of criticism.  A good summary of this argument is [here](http://www.salon.com/2014/11/09/you_dont_protect_my_freedom_our_childish_insistence_on_calling_soldiers_heroes_deadens_real_democracy/ ).  Unlike most of the more simplistic pro-US military films (i.e., [literally any which show US military planes and battleships](http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2004/09/operation-hollywood )), this Eastwood effort represents a more cunning and noxious form of propaganda.    From a moral perspective, it presents a pretzel-like logic, getting the audience to feel sympathy for the killer because of the stress he feels from all the killing he did, but none for those killed, a story still yet at odds with the reality in which the actual protagonist thrilled in his murders.  Eastwood is an incredibly talented filmmaker, and he's used his skills to teach Americans (yet again) to love and honor their military, to shed tears for them, instead of doing what they should: demand that they be held accountable for their actions and question the morality of enlisting in the first place.      And [the thoughts of that veteran](http://abcnews.go.com/US/tomas-young-iraq-war-veteran-antiwar-activist-dead/story?id=26846330 ) would run counter to the false narrative that Clint Eastwood and the rest of the GOP want to push.   **EDIT**: Bring on your downvotes.  You definitely don't have any arguments left to defend this propaganda garbage.  - - - - - - - -  I did.  Did you?  It doesn't feel like it.  From the very first scene, the sniper is presented as someone who wrestles with moral dilemmas - do I shoot the kid who is carrying an RPG or not?  His buddy tells him he's going to be sent to jail if he makes the wrong call (for shooting a man who it is strongly implied is coordinating an attack against a US convoy).  The made up version of Kyle doesn't take the shot.  The very next scene we see the hero" Kyle as a boy learning from his father the  lesson about standing up to bullies, that we are told none too subtly is his life "purpose".  Either you haven't seen the movie or this heavy handed propaganda message isn't obvious enough for you: we're being educated that the US military and its agents are good moral people doing only what is necessary, the kind of people who "stand up to bullies".  Shortly thereafter, the twin towers come down... the themes are blunt and ideological, and serve their purpose.  The truth is the American military hides war crimes, invades countries pre-emptively, and its sniper-hero is actually a hate-filled racist sociopath who bragged that killing was something he "loved", who said everyone was a "bad guy",  "I hate the damn savages", and  "I could give a flying fuck about the Iraqis".  But, since it's important not to expose the American public to what the war and its "heroes" actually are, propaganda-Kyle is presented as a great guy with a hot girlfriend who just wants to "do my job when the day comes".  When the twin towers coming down, our newly married hero is off to confront the "bullies" who apparently did this to us in Iraq.    And then there he is killing the little boy and his mom.  He was forced to, don't you see.  And the supine American audience drinks in the message: the American military is *forced* to kill all those civilians.  They try as hard as they can to avoid collateral damage, but they're sending their wives and kids to kill our anti-bully brigade!  All the while, Kyle makes kill after kill of bomb-carrying Arab, nearly getting sick after each shot, so moral and feeling a man is he.  Quite the opposite of the reality, of course, but such are the standard tools of trade of a propagandist.  The bullshit is thick in this one, but Americans are so full of it at this point that it smells like roses.    The New York Times, the "fair and balanced" newspaper for coverage of Israel.   Portraying a lying sociopath as a military hero is what I'd call noxious propaganda, not "a good movie".     http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jan/06/real-american-sniper-hate-filled-killer-why-patriots-calling-hero-chris-kyle   You ought to read: http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jan/06/real-american-sniper-hate-filled-killer-why-patriots-calling-hero-chris-kyle   It's called shamelessly scoring political points.  The Obamas are inoculating themselves against the jingoist rage that is constantly simmering beneath the surface of the American right. Embracing the lies of a sociopathic war criminal is a way of signaling, in the perverse reality of American politics, that they are truly and unquestionably patriotic.  The anti-war left is so obliterated and hopeless, that they can do this without shame or cost to their reputations.   Haaretz: [What exactly did Goldstone 'retract' from his report on Gaza? Richard Goldstone's strange op-ed, in which he backtracked on his report claiming Israel targeted civilians, does not seem to be grounded in the UN's final report on Cast Lead.](http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/features/what-exactly-did-goldstone-retract-from-his-report-on-gaza-1.355454 )   I asked Goldstone to help point out even a single word in the two reports that could justify his vague statement about the non-existence of the policy on harming civilians - while both reports repeatedly criticize Israel for not having investigated this issue at all.   Apologizing politely, the South African freedom fighter said he had imposed media silence on himself.  We can only speculate on how this man was threatened.   Wow.  I hope they weren't just drinking too much coffee when they came up with this.        How is this off topic?   And look at what that did to pervert the priorities of his administration.  Not a single banker in jail, the too big to fail banks are bigger than before the crash, etc.   And they will be informed by Fox News that Obamacare took away their healthcare.               Yet today, the reigning economic ideology asks us to suppress what nature has designed and be entirely selfish.     I don't think comparing the relative sizes really rebuts OP's arguments.  What arguments does it not rebut?  I assumed OP was arguing that the absolute values of these thefts tells us something about which currency is more secure.  *That* argument is pure bullshit, which the data I show above pretty conclusively demonstrate.  However, if you mean that OP has some *other* arguments, I might agree.  What are they?     Markdown problem - I needed an extra carriage return.  Fixed now.   Can't find the tweets with Isabella Kaminska, so can only guess at your argument from what is posted here, which seems to be comparing the absolute numbers of the thefts to argue that fractional reserve is more risky.  But what do the absolute sizes of the thefts have to do with anything?  Euros in circulation = 956 Billion  Bitcoins in circulation = 3 Billion USD = 2.8 Billion Euro  **Stolen euros as a fraction of total in circulation**: 2B Euro /956B Euro = .2%  **Lost bitcoins as a fraction of total in circulation**: 5M  Euro/ 2.8B Euro = .17%     Time to pull out the pitchforks.   Another possibility is that Republicans know exactly what they are doing.  Whether this costs us more *collectively* matters less than who ends up with relatively more after the distribution.    When you look at their policies through the lens of labor exploitation things make more sense.  The more brutal and humiliating is the state of unemployment, the better deal an employer can make when signing a contract.  These fights are about the bargaining power of labor.   Let me add to that this  interview with one of the authors, which leads off with calling her a quack:  http://www.alternet.org/food/meet-controversial-mit-scientist-who-claims-have-discovered-cause-gluten-sensitivty   Not for black folks.  But that said, this particular guy was acting aggressively.  Perhaps police in another country might have handled this without gun violence, but the dude in this video was clearly threatening the officer.  	189

My drop-down bars were not ideal.   I won't argue about what you want to do, but most named commercial strawberries are clones, usually out of tissue culture.   Well, with strawberries, you can propagate them asexually, so it doesn't matter.  Otherwise, breeders generally consider F7 lines to be inbred. 7 generations increases the homozygosity to 99.2%. 1-1/2^7 Once inbred, plants will generally come true from seed.  If inbreeding depression is a problem with the genera you are attempting to breed, then you need to select subpopulations as opposed to single plants. Say you make a cross, then grow all the seed from that cross. Then, select maybe half the plants and interbreed them. Grow them up again, select again. Each time you'll enrich in the genes you want without (hopefully) causing too much inbreeding. The minimum plants needed to prevent inbreeding within a population also depends on the genera.  So, you've got some research to do.   What is your climate like? Is it possible the tree has too much or not enough water?  	25

Oddly complimentary to each other...      love this track...Fear of Music might be my favorite Talking Heads album   Wut? This is awesome.  Dude is such a unique performer, will be interesting to see where he goes.   Just checked out Bromst.  Solid stuff.  I feel like I've heard of him over the years but never took the time to listen.  	5
 Well the lube means it's not happening often enough that he can go in dry. That might be comforting.   We really need to stop recruiting kickers. Interhall ones seem to work out pretty well.   Gotta drop 4 art references in every song.   Hibbert trying to show if Korver can get blocks, he can shoot 3s.   How does 47% of the class score above the middle 50%?   Aren't songs by people like Kesha and Pitbull also about having fun and living life?   Interesting, though, that he kept talking about out of state students, and threw out ND, Duke, and Northwestern as example schools, since none of them have out of state tuition.   I don't understand why so many middle class people seem to relate to Eminem, except for the fact that he's white. I relate to Kanye way more than Em. Though if all I cared about was relatability, I'd just listen to Asher Roth.   Can't feel good when employees of the network you're showing up on are calling you out, too.   Clearly he just suspects Chloe Bennet of being an alien.   Holy shit sums it up pretty well.   \#SwagOverload   Yeah, the problem with calling it gay is that it's too broad a statement.   Nah, it's all a conspiracy for some reason or another. Something something Kelly antichrist.   So humble.   Boston Pink Floyd is best Pink Floyd.   Why do people still want to watch music videos on TV? We have youtube, there's no reason to wait and hope the right one shows up.   Well Girl Meets World is starting soon, so maybe that takes care of one of them.   Between DGB, Ronald Darby and Seantrel Henderson this past week, I don't feel as bad about some of the guys we missed out on.   Well they don't need another one. Oden fulfills the injury prone center requirement.   At least in college, they do have some differences. The shot clock is 5 seconds shorter which leads to quicker possessions. Women's basketball also tends to have a lot more off ball movement.   You also have to take into account costs. 10% is going to your agent. 50% is going to taxes. You also have extra medical and nutritional costs the average person won't. And those medical costs especially are probably going to continue for the rest of your life.   Is Evan Turner one of those people who can find everyone's biggest insecurities and targets his own team before the game? That's the only explanation I can think of.   I think the only pills I really took while I was in college were ibuprofen when I was hungover. Might have taken benadryl once. You should be fine.   I'm glad Bieber called a conference of himself, Nicki Minaj and Chuck Norris to discuss music.   They're not even the worst power conference team in the state.   I usually just hop up out the bed and turn my swag on.   We used to have paintings, now we just have graphs.   How do you not include who shot Mr. Burns as a memorable moment?   Em literally has a skit called Bitch.   Half of those were in the 2000s.   It's not like Disney's still coming out with good movies like Frozen or anything.   I think she knows the words about as well as I do.   But I have seen a lot of very special episodes from the late 80s and early 90s about how no means no.   My favorite moment of his at ND was when he ended a tweet with \#GunnerKielQuotes.   To those who know Notre Dame, no explanation is necessary. To those who dont, no explanation will suffice. -Lou Holtz   His name was Hans, what were you expecting?   This girl doesn't want to date me, clearly she's hiding her feelings for me.   I had someone in a history class ask how many African Americans there were in some European country before realizing how stupid she sounded.   And it's not just the second contract. Long term it gives you an extra year towards your pension, as well. This doesn't matter as much to the stars, but it'll help out the career backups a lot.   You can still get channels over the air for free if you live in a big enough city.   Can't say enough good things about this. Highly recommend.   I can live with that.   Went to a college with single sex dorms. My on campus job had a student manager that was trans. He was a senior who had been gradually moving towards male and by now could pass pretty well. I made a comment to a freshman about how he was friends with a girl because they'd lived in the same dorm. Didn't even think about how that would out him.   He should just bring out his seatless bike.   [If you don't judge my golds chains, I'll forget the iron chains.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KSurzeGvPrQ)   And the state of Indiana is now eliminated from the tournament. Hoosier Hysteria took a step back this year.   What about the Monkees?   Why do you think she's awake at 6 am on a Saturday?   It wouldn't be the [first time he tried something like that.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OD380XDs-NY)   LenDale White was a solid RB.   I think the problem is a lot of people don't understand his rhyme scheme. A lot of his bigger songs have lines that end with the same word, especially the n word, and they don't realize it's an internal rhyme.   He doesn't really have knee issues, he has playing military academy issues. They'll take out knees of anybody.   The fact that she was considered a booster is kind of ridiculous.   The only player I'd rather draft is Louis Nix. I'd be really happy with Do It Tuitt though.   Playing catchphrase with Big Lou is probably one of my favorite college memories.    But we play Navy therefore our entire schedule is invalid.   When I lived in Bloomington, the KMart I worked at accidentally got a huge shipment of Oklahoma gear instead of IU.   I see.   That would explain the Anna Nicole update headline.   The thing is though, Kanye's audience is much more middle class 20 somethings than a lot of other rappers. Honestly, Kanye, at least his early stuff, ought to be way more relatable to a white middle class 20 something than say Eminem, unless we're just basing on skin color.   It also depends on the company. If it's an up or out company, that might be a perfectly reasonable thing to say.   What if Ted already died and Bob Saget had brain failure. They did an experimental brain transplant and Ted is now Bob Saget.   Everett Slays Pussy Nightly   But if you lose your virginity before you're 30, you'll never be a wizard!   I'm almost offended by the lack of Kanye in this.   I'm a huge Blink fan, but I'll be damned if I'm going to count them as real musicians, and not count someone like Bruno Mars. The only member of Blink-182 with a ton of talent is Travis Barker (who I might does a lot with hip hop on the side).   This is a really specifically timed picture. A point in time where teenagers had cell phones, but before teen mom.   Obviously one of his real life struggles is bitches.   I never thought I'd see the day there were 2 Bears on a list like this.   It's not even the cut blocks. It's the god damn receivers diving at our corner's knees after the whistle 30 yards from the fucking ball. Wash rinse repeat for other positions depending on the game.   Man Fairly Oddparents is fucking awesome.   Public schools do, too. Oden got approached about moving an hour away to Indianapolis while he was in middle school.   I think I can safely say enough time has passed and Encore still isn't that good.   I swear half the songs off Blinks first 3 albums are about sex. And that's probably a conservative estimate. This is a band that wrote a song about Ben Wah Balls for fucks sake.   This whole picture is 90s clothing.   Since when has Em been at the top of rap this whole time? He released 3 great albums in 4 years, then waited 2 years to make one with a huge drop off. Then waited another 5 to make one that even dropped a little further. He went 8 years without a good album. If you want to make an argument for sustained success recently, Kanye has a much better case.   Parents picking up was awful. Only slightly better was a sibling.   I didn't realize there were actually people who wore top hats.   Heads up 7 up that's the way we like to fuck.   Should probably be able to spell Bel-Air, too.   That's just because we're godless and legalized abortion.   Also fuck TV refs. I hate those damn orange gloves.   You say no to ratchet pussy, Juicy J cant!   Shitty chicken dinners were a huge social issue back then.   Yeah they played this on Elvis Duran the other day.   Yeah a schools now are even combining their library schools with computer science and informatics.   He had a hell of a 24 hours when he took that.   I'm sure it has nothing to die with 2004 pop culture having been easier in 2004 than in 2014.   Freshman year I went to a lot of similar parties. I had a group of drunk friends that I saw at every party but never anywhere else.   We called it Kario Mart.   Flocka is one my favorites for pregame music. So hype.   You despise racism and yet your first thought is that he's just an angry black man?   I'm pretty sure the Duck Dynasty guy's interaction with black people back then is pretty much limited to having seen Song of the South. That's the only way I can see how he got that view.   HS running back, still plays like one when he gets the ball. I love Golden.   Eli and Peyton need to work out whatever differences they're having. Clearly we have some Freaky Friday body switching shit going on.   And neither are his real voice.   I would probably find it cute the first time. Might get old though.   I wanted to be one but my first grade teacher couldn't spell it so I had to want to be an astronaut instead.   We had something like 10 NFL players on defense that last year with Weis, too.  	100

Buy fish tank and use as real tank?   \Denial   I like HK guns because they have a certain style, new and old, that appeal to me.   I like the G36 platform because of how the magazine looks. I also think the handguards are a good combo with the stock. Just look good together to me.  I like the look of G3 rifles because of the slim look of the handguard paired with the large 7.62 magazine. I think they pair well together.  I like the MP5k and MP5 series because of the weld marks (Same with the G3 I guess). Along with the handguard I think it gives it a simple, no bullshit look.   I like the XM8 because it looks like a fish, and it has a futuristic look that appeals to me.  Finally I like most 7.62 platform guns (FAL, G3, SCAR-H) because of the larger magazines. To me, it gives it a sturdy look. This one is harder for me to explain, but that's a good way to put it.  Those are my raisins.    Yeaaaahhhhh Dealiest Warrior is definitely sketchy.

The bubbles just stayed from yesterday and haven't dissipated.   I should have said I got the fish today, and the tank yesterday lol  I filled it yesterday and let it cycle and stuff all day yesterday, and added the water conditioner and stuff.    I got into it from watching the OP and figuring, "Huh sciency stuff, alright"   That's why the show gets a lot of hate, but I loved the slice of life beginning and the mind fuck ending. It's definitely my favorite anime.   Yeah I cycled the tank and did all of the stuff I did with my first tank. I planned on keeping this tank set up for another month and saving up for a larger tank.   When I get a larger tank I was planning on getting a clown knife fish, which I originally wanted but figured an Oscar would be good for now.   Did I do something wrong..?   I will put cameras on them and mount gats   Also [the KGB never used it.] (http://www.imfdb.org/wiki/List_of_firearms_used_by_the_Armed_Forces_of_the_Russian_Federation)   [Bam.] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C5%A0korpion_vz._61)   "Czechoslovak submachine gun developed in 1959"   "Adopted by the Czech army and security forces, and later exported to various countries."

It's a metroid   ***DJ KHALEDDDD***   GO BUY YO SELF A HOUSE   **GURL YOU SMAWHT**   Dolphinately   Mine is [space AUG] (http://i.imgur.com/IUYQUFy.jpg) now.   Yeah, after awhile I was like, "This gun is shit"   Then I got a JG AUG   I started with a Crosman Gameface AK lol   [It's almost to regular sport-line AEG and then it falls short] (http://www.evike.com/products/48536/)   ^^^^^Yes.   **Yes.**   Oh I didn't see that hat part and assumed you were talking about the gun since it's shiny, and hats aren't.   But it has the add to cart option for some reason lol   Should've saved up a little bit more to get the other sport-line G36 model that Umarex sells   It's because it's that cheap springer/lpeg combo G36 that Umarex sport-line makes      Fun   YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE~   What really happens if you swallow magnets? I wanna know.   One time I ate a triple A battery and it never came out.    *memegarchy   If you watch the full video with volume then the part with the gate makes more sense. I thought it was zombies, but the guy up against the fence is her father helping her escape from some sort of rebels or combatants.       Prolly   Nope   feelsbadman   NoTears OnlyDreams   \tfw you don't know what I mean when I say "robot" in that context   \tfw you aren't even living by yourself/you're a minor and still act like a robot   Other than work and airhard I pretty much stay home lol   Fun show all around only into episode 3.   I also thought, "Man what if Tamako was at school or some shit, and the whole shopping district was carpet bombed while she was gone"  I need to go outside.    I've heard wonderful things about it.   srry bb   Ask /u/Catbrain then lol   Ha. Sorry.   I'm guessing you're just a random dude who doesn't airsoft and gets a lot of annoying messages from people who think you're /u/Catbrain lol   Airsoft World is a popular UK retailer.    \Not torrenting everything   I watched the whole series subbed first, and then dubbed and it's still my favorite anime.   Ask /u/Catbrains then lol   I've played for three years and now my walls are covered in guns lol   Asides from the corrupt government and the forgotten species of time?   Yeah it's the official.   I agree that they didn't get the same level of emotion, but I think it's one of the best dubs I've seen. Also, I thought the voice was very suiting.    Yey    [Bam] (http://imgur.com/a/dIDRF)  First picture (Top to bottom)   Eureka   Marcy   Detention (long story)  MP5k doesn't have a name  Last Picture (Top to bottom)   XM8 doesn't have a name   Yui   Alice   I barely even play lol   Nah KV is the different stock.   I am rich in memes   Only difference is the bucking, and motor. Echo 1 SOF 2 comes with an Echo 1 motor.   Isn't this only the K since it has the skeleton foldy stock, and not the full foldy stock?   Is that a Psycho Pass reference?   :'^(   ayyyyyyyyyyyyyyy   ayyyy   G36-chan best raifu   So she FAL into his trap   Did it FALl down?   Did she FAL in love?   AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA   [And it worked] (http://imgur.com/a/dIDRF)   Stupid SD card port won't work.   I'll make a post tomorrow lol   Lemme grab le camera   I love everything HK and I like Bundeswehr gear, but I'd never think  of doing a complete loadout. I have a set of Tropentan BDU's but that's probably as far as I'd go lol.  Also are you sure it's the G36E or the standard G36? I thought my G36 was a G36E, but the bayonet lug is the one on the standard G36.   Oh the WE Open Bolt GBBR G36's have stickers of those trades there.   Nice to see another airsofter delving into the beautiful world of HK.    What's the gun..?   The sticker makes me think WE, but it also looks exactly like my G36 by JG so I'm confuse.    Ha. Cool.   I met a kid and asked if he airsofted and he showed me one of those Cybergun FAMAS's, and he said what guns do I have. He about shit his pants when I turned my laptop and showed him my gun walls.    Meh   Yeah at the end of the URL I saw "poo" and I had a good laugh.   Multicam.   *Cringe*  Title.   ***Cringe***   *One of us. One of us.*   I actually made it a little louder there to make it seem like he's trying to talk over him.   Zeus. It's Zeus.   But J.C. Staff is great.   They did an amazing job on Sakurasou and Toradora.   I'm waiting for Durarara X2 this coming 4th and Gakkou Gurashi on the 10th, so I'm set.   Yeah I still got feels while editing it   It's pretty comfy and sometimes I wear it in the winter  	138
 I hope he doesnt have that kind of role but sadly I think thats whats gonna happen, I mean arent they already shooting it now??? no actor is cast yet.    Yes its nice that they got these d list characters in the comics like Guardians or the Inhumans to big shots in the MCU. I cant imagine how awesome it would be to have all of the rights to the characters but honestly they dont need X Men at all its fine in its own universe and the movies are doing great, I only wish that the ff had reverted would have loved to see galactus and silver surfer in Infinity War.    Alright.    good choices.    didnt kill himself??? say he turned himself in and spent the rest of his life in prison would that have been a good end???    That would have been cool to see him.    yay finally someone agrees with me!!!!    Shes a fug who blows someone to get more exposure.    yeah thats the only downside to it really its like a tv show ya know except if a tv show had big budgets and different mediums.    Oh I wish I had seen this one in theaters I remember seeing the posters and stuff when i was 8 and I wanted to watch it so badly.    Aha sure.    well we will see about that.    I think this is the main reason most directors dont return for marvel sequels and stuff.    he would be awesome as bond.    the best explanation.    LOL so much like the sony hack and the Interview LOL.    Those are the titles thank you.    Will Smith would make a good villain.    A movie called Give em hell Malone there is a villain on there who is almost just like The Joker I forgot his name though, man I need to watch that movie again it was good.     Gonna get some heat for this but Megan fox    Yeah true and true    I hope they give it a rest for a few years and then reboot it with a whole new cast.    Yeah they really had something interesting with Freddy vs Jason but instead it was just the one film.    You forgot Ross and rachel.    Yes it is.    Because all of his films are so generic and have the same type of humor with the same actors pretty much and Sandler never really "acts" in his comedies. IMO besides his dramatic stuff everything since Anger management is shit.    Because he isnt.    Yeah I still wish he had stayed.    Armageddon every time I watch it it feels like I am watching it new again.    Because the expectations were to high and most people think it fell flat and wasnt a worthy ending to the series. personally I like it not as good as TDK but still good.    1) watch the other movies  2) watch the other movies 3) watch the other movies 4) Watch the other movies 5) watch the other movies   cool.    Cool    Yes    He probably retired or something.    I love that scene I wish i could watch it in the theater again.    yeah they could make it a dramatic thriller or something.    I always thought a movie about Chernobyl would be cool.    Whoa thats cool.    yes they are.    UGH just make the dam movies already.    O thank god I dont live there LOL    Stupid fat Hobbit he ruins it!!!!!       And Marion Cotillard said the same thing during production of the Dark Knight Rises.    It was nice to finally see him again hope to see him with a bigger role in the next films.    yes indeed    Because its so intense and has good performances.    What are some cool ideas for the 8th film??? I know it will likely just be Diesel and a few others obviously no Brian either. New York sounds cool.    The Dark Knight    The Lovely Bones I know everyone hates it but I always liked it it is my favorite movie ever.    Yes please    It will likely never happen there is more of a chance of a godfather part 4 than Hellboy 3.    Such an awesome movie!!!!! I loved it!!!!! great sendoff to Paul at the end I was almost in tears.    He was awesome!!!!!!! Lol I am your father and some of his lines were great    HAHAHAHAHAHA    Funny episode.    Every episode??? Holy shit the most I ever watched was 10.    My name is weiner, my name is weiner.    Those Wolves seem pretty weird.    Ba ba dook    Alright    Of course my sister lives in NY im in AZ and I wanted to find it so she wont have to pay a whole lot when she visits.    Really?? Weird I thought it was a good site.    Yes thank you!!!!!!!!!!    I read something a few months ago about a website that is run by some indian college student and it has the cheapest flights ever. I believe that it is so popular that all the big ones want to shut it down. what is it???    Release order no other way.    that would be so cool.    If I am watching a brand new movie then I wont look at my phone much, when I am rewatching a movie then yes I do it more often especially at the boring parts.    I should have saw It Follows I mean it was okay but not that much the best thing about it was will and kevin.    Thank you    240 and ive been looking into exercising and loosing weight I just need the right mindset.    Okay sounds good    Should I watch this or It Follows this weekend?????    That would have been an awesome ending.    Yes it will hopefully anyways I do wish Edgar Wright was still around though.    I also wish they had shown another MC besides the mayans that the sons would war with like full blown criminals/killers. Kind of like an evil version of samcro.    I wish they had just killed him I wanted him to die for what he did.    He was cool nice and quirky and stuff. Wish he came back for at least one more episode.    Looks better than i thought it would cant wait!!!!!!    I laughed so hard at that part I rewound it like 4 times!!!!! At first I was like oh a long musical scene cool then bam haha.    Yeah I remember that year and honestly the oscars are nothing more than a big poularity contest and all the winners are the ones that kissed so much ass just to get a nom I wish by some divine miracle superhero movies would win some major awards but that likely wont happen.    It seemed like they were good friends before thats why their scenes mean so much.    Yes thank you for proving my point.    he wasnt really a list in a way plus he is getting steady gigs here and there so thats something.    They could have just stuck him in supporting in Foxxs place that year and since you said foxx is more of a lead anyway then it would have been cool.    Its annoying how he wasnt nominated for that one but freakin jamie foxx was.    HAHAHA Brittas musical scene!!!!!!    Thats a sad movie.    OMG good story I understand it now.     WOW and thank you means a lot.    Hes a really good actor I hope he gets some good film work in the future.    Really    Yes shes good in it I fell in love with the character fast.    Sometimes I wonder what it is like to be an attractive female like Scarlet Johansen or jennifer Lawrence. I just wonder what all of the attention will be like. Instead I am an overweight guy with lots of health problems I have barely any friends and the ones I do rarely call me anymore. I am also a virgin.    The Lovely Bones I know people dont like it or at least most of them but I actually really liked it and it is to this day my all time favorite movie.    Yes    Set it in Space and have him save the earth from terrorist aliens.    I cant wait to watch it!!!!! When I get some free time that is.    Thank you lady you saved my life!!!!!!!!!!    Sounds about right.    Also my Birthday    I LOVE it been doing it for years I mean I like going with other people too but I am just so used of being by myself nowadays that it works then.    Yes she is indeed a tool I do think she is hot though.    I usually notice things that I havent the first time.    Just get Hulu and Netflix and you will be entertained for a long time.    Bitch Lobatomized Jack!!!!!    Oh yes I hated him in that one just a big jerk.    Ill check it out    Yes Thank you so much yahoo Screen!!!!! I cant be more thankful for bringing one of my favorite shows back!!!!!    An editor and its usually the producer.   	111

Kobaryo is a fantastic Japanese hardcore artist, check him out if you like hardcore!   watch out bro, Konami might come to your office and smash that thing    I can't seem to find it anywhere :/ (sorry for the dumb question)   I literally just found out as well, I was poking around his discogs page and I saw Srezcat under aliases, he just released a song as both Kobaryo and Srezcat called speed complex on the latest Massive Circlez compilation, fingers crossed for more tracks soon!      seamlessR makes really good neuro DnB stuff and hes trying hardstyle for the first time. His tutorials have helped me a lot but I don't think this is going to go well for him    Ok, I've been trying to make a hardstyle kick for a long time and I always end up with a hardcore kick. I love hardcore but I really want to make hardstyle. [Heres a FLP of a kick I'm proud of,](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/yliwda51u5vzemr/AABoYYwwTJrVy8lnVV1OhSr2a?dl=0) let me know where in the fx chain I go wrong! Also do what you want with the kicks    sadly not everyone appreciates the skullfuckery that is crossbreed       Thanks dude! I'll be doing more of these for sure, I started Re-sampling some picks of touhou characters so I'll see where that goes    Me: hey did you litter!?!   Other person: no......  Me: !!   Having links to seamlessR's channel would be a start, some links to forums and good free sample packs, create a /r/edmproduction essential pack with samples and patches for well known synths like harmor, sylenth1, serum and massive (probably missing afew) and linking to really well known tutorials for things like side chaining and stuff along those lines  and putting all of those in a beginner tab would really help out a lot of new producers. Having genre specific sections would also be great i.e. hard dance most popular plug-ins, kick tutorials, lead tutorials, sample packs things like that   Here are some previews if you want to listen before you download!

When I get into a new genre I like to go all out and buying a ton of tracks, are their any massive compilations out there or will I just have to buy a ton of EPs? Ok now for the second part of the title, I just haven't been listening to a lot of Hardstyle lately, I don't know why because I still love it, I guess I just got kinda bored :/, but know I want to get back into it, are their any recent releases I should check out?    Looks pretty cool doesn't it?    You can buy them!! They are expensive though (40$)    The actual design isn't mine but the shirt is (kinda) check out Yo Shirt (iPhone only) you can take any picture and turn it into a screen print shirt   *inhales through teeth* ya....

I don't know how AMA's are organized on here but I do have afew sugestions: Headhunterz, he made the switch from hardstyle to house a bit ago so I think people would have some questions for him. Angerfist, he had his own festival last year and he released a pretty kick ass album to go along with it. Noisecontrollers, one of the biggest names in the hardstyle scene, he has an album coming out soon and I think it would be cool to ask him afew questions       Get this track and many others on the #TIH soundcloud for free! Support what these guys are doing and enjoy       I think we're not kind enough actually, your videos are fantastic!

I want to give this one a fair chance since a lot of people like it       For the hard dance boys and girls!

The QULT line up looks amazing with people like Yoji, ASYS, Geck-o and Issac on the hard trance stage they got people like Kidd Kaos and Dark By Design and on the Kiddfectious stage they got Tone (if you don't know who tone is, he did a song with kidd kaos (his only song) called closer and it's fantastic)   Lucky...

 Mods don't remove this please, just making fun of the current state of GTA V "cracks" :)      I'm sure it did.   Lol. Try hovering over PlayGTAV.exe. http://i.imgur.com/R7fyIvh.png Can't even tell if it's virus, or just a troll.   Not sure if making them public here would be smart. Though I'd also love to know some.   Fake. The settings menu looks different from the [legit version.](http://www.pcgamer.com/gta-5-pc-graphics-options-in-full/)   Clearly you've never heard of private trackers. You don't really have to download 60GB from ThePirateBay @ 100kb/s   Pretty much... the game will be released in 4 days... we've waited years, a few days isn't so bad.   I have a 60MB download internet connection. I could download a scene release of GTA V in 150 minutes at full speed from a private tracker.    Maybe the game .exe is tied to the launcher for DRM stuff. I don't know.   Keygen? I think it uses online activation. And I have no clue if the launcher unpacks the .exe or something, but in GTA IV, if I remember correctly, the game .exe and the launcher were separate files.    Aside from spending hours trying to bypass the messagebox in the setup, not really. Someone with much more experience could probably start snooping around that launcher, though. Maybe I'll turn on my VPN and create a fake account to test it.   EDIT: oh.   So, here's what I "found". I couldn't run the setup properly because of the "You don't have the game installed" messagebox. BUT, they're using some crap installer with content you can extract with Winrar/7zip. [It's 2 DLLs \(setup-related I think\), and the GTA V launcher.](https://onedrive.live.com/redir?resid=1DA9308D1CF31D10!566 authkey=!AP4BLF7E0XbqRr4 ithint=folder%2cexe) You can run it. It downloads and installs Social Club, and then asks you for login (not sure what happens after). I tried using PEiD to check if it's protected, but it says "Not a valid PE file". I loaded it into IDA, and checked the strings, it's obvious it's packed (well, that was expected).   "uploading" LOL. These blogs lie, but usually upload legit stuff. Not this time, I guess. Wonder that they're uploading xD   Same. The last groundbreaking stuff from them was **The_Settlers_7-Razor1911**, maybe **Starcraft_II_Wings_Of_Liberty_Proper-Razor1911** too. DRM-wise, of course.   Could you PM me that day one patch link? Frankly, I don't think Rockstar would be stupid enough to include all necessary files (even if they're DRM files) in the retail copies/preloads, though I'm still hoping they are.    I'd say that can be done. With the retail copies floating around + steam preload, there's no doubt some group already has it, and might be working on the crack. This shouldn't have denuvo, nor any complicated crap.   I bet the guy behind this is crying of laughter. Damn sceners.   Yhup, and marked as spam [here](http://pre.corrupt-net.org/index.php?q=group:Razor1911). God, I was so hyped.    That's great, but this is about the pre "Grand_Theft_Auto_V-Razor1911". Please don't flood this thread with "y'all should buy dis it's gr8 gaem m8" posts like this.   First you'd need the release... which isn't available anywhere... (yet?). And it might be spam.   Since it was pre'd almost an hour ago and no scene tracker seems to have it yet, I think it might have been pre spam/fake. So probably none of that yet... :(   Like 5 mins after it got pre'd the "SKIDROW FANS" facebook page updated the crack status to "coming up". Well, I'm surprised these people know what a pre database is :p      Are the colors in colorblind mode or something?   Alright, thanks for replying!   If the games are stored in big files (let's say, lot's of 1GB ones) though, wouldn't it be better if I used the external with faster sequential reading/writing?   The external HDD is faster in sequential reading/writing, but a bit slower in everything else. Should I install big games like GTA V in the external or the internal?  Here's a CrystalDiskBench for comparison: http://i.imgur.com/4s3nYH4.png  Thanks! :)   I don't think there is a crack yet. Anyway, here's a great piece of advice: **DON'T RUSH INTO THE FIRST P2P RELEASE YOU SEE.** Wait for a **SCENE RELEASE**.   Hardline is fun to some extent. My point is that what they charge for it (even 40) is too much for what you get.    If you mean key store sites... I got BF4 Premium from G2A it worked fine. But after the Ubisoft fiasco (I wasn't affected), I became skeptical about these sites. I know you'll argue "but it workz 4 me!", but to me buying from G2A/Kinguin/etc is no different than buying a cheap DVD from a street seller and praying it works fine.   Same. I bought in a local retail store. I don't think I can have a refund either.   I do. Well. Let me get this straight. I payed 60 for this at launch (March 20). I got:  * Way less weapons than BF4  * Standard edition. BF4 had that special edition for the SAME price (60) and it included the China Rising DLC with 4 new maps.  * Poorer performance than BF4. It's PunkBuster? It's my PC that sucks? I don't care what's the excuse. It runs on the same engine as BF4 and the game feels choppy, specially in 64 players. Believe me, I tried capping the FPS, messing around in NVIDIA Control Panel. BF4 always runs smooth.  * Clusterfuck Call of Duty maps. I used to consider myself an infantry guy, but my god. It always feels like TDM in the main modes (Blood Money   Heist). ***Spawn. Dead. Spawn. Dead.***  If I try to play the objective I kinda enjoy it a bit. But it gets boring after a while.  * Boring and pointless campaign. I know Battlefield never was about singleplayer, but they promised us a "Visceral-quality campaign", and what did we get? The same boring crap.  The launch was somewhat smooth because this is a Battlefield 4 rip off. Yet they still managed to fuck up Punkbuster.  As if that weren't enough, it's now for sale on Origin, two weeks after the release, for **39.99!**  I feel like an idiot. But well. EA won't fool me again. I learned my lesson. **They charge 60 because that's what people are willing to pay for the game.**   What about [Boonzi](http://www.boonzi.pt/)? Seems to support online banking and everything. And it's a national product :)   still cheapa dan my peasant pc freind he pay $5000 for gtx 550 and core2quad and cant even run theorder1886 lel   Yhep. I loved the freecam on Debug mode. It was fun going to that secret room with all the NPCs, visiting Hagrid's hut underground... and griffindor's challenge. HP2 for PC was one of the best games I've ever played.   Happened to me recently, thought it was because of the patch.  	37
 You obviously have 0 empathy.   Just gonna chime in here about something that may seem minor to you but I'm pretty sure a psychotic episode lasts for a lot longer than a day.   The side effects of the drugs don't seem worth it anymore. I was such a zombie that didn't care if he lived or died. Someone could've came in my house and robbed me and I would've just sat there and watched. I'll obviously continue medication if I ever get symptoms again but for the time being, I feel much better without the meds. I've always thought that the medication should only be used short term for when psychosis props up (obviously some people need them all the time, but a lot of us dont).   Kurt is still really relevant today, especially amount teenagers and young adults. He died in his prime, he'll never fade away.   Isn't natural happiness just serotonin, dopamine, endorphins etc. getting released too, just in smaller amounts?   Maybe the kid ate it super fast.   Favourite part about this gif is how it looks like the cat laughs at the end.   It's the whole reason people have to go to therapy.    kids fucking these days  FTFY   Doctor Insano can check it out.   What medication are you on? If it's antipsychotics then 9/10 of them make you sedated.   He'll be in bed all day instead of out of bed.   I've really not got around to trying it yet. I really have no clue how I'd go about getting CBD only strains if weed is still illegal in the UK, unless CBD is legal in the UK? I'm not completely sure, I should look into it a little bit more. And yes, I have schizophrenia and I can say without a shadow of a doubt that the cognitive decline and negative symptoms are by far the most disabling.    There obviously isn't much studies around it just yet but there has been a bunch of personal exp that I've heard over at /r/schizophrenia that say that it helps with negative symptoms (the most damaging symptoms of schizophrenia). Antipsychotics right now, don't help at all with the negative symptoms and if they do its very, very minimal. So if CBD is an antipsychotic that can help negative symptoms then it would be an insane breakthrough for people like me.   CBD is actually a pretty good antipsychotic (even for negative symptoms, some people have tried it)... Probably way better than the antipsychotics we have to use right now.    That interviewer was really anxious when I seen that interview. f0rest definitely banged that though.   Advice from a non-schizophrenic is always welcome mainly because it helps me understand people that are "normal" a little bit better, and gives me a completely new perspective and ways of thinking about things I guess you could say, just like if I told a non-schizophrenic about my perspective then it could also change theirs (if that made any sense at all).   I wouldn't say she reacted negatively but she reacted in a weird way, maybe passive-aggressive? I'm not sure. I think she likes but also hates that I can't empathize as well as others. I CAN empathize it's just weakened most of the time unless I've built a strong strong relationship with you which usually takes so long that people give up.  It's never really caused a full blown argument with anyone, they usually just stop speaking to me for a while (or I somehow stop speaking to them).   I've taken stupid amounts of tramadol (don't take over 400mg like I did, it was stupid) and I nodded so hard that I was talking to my girlfriend on facetime and I kept nodding out and thinking I was still talking to her, shit was crazy and that went on for a good 12 hours.   Benzo AND alcohol withdrawal is definitely worse than opiate withdrawal but opiate withdrawal definitely fucks with you mentally (not nearly as much as benzos but still bad).      I'd like to think I could.   Consult Dr. Insano.   He seems like a sociopathic, narcissistic retard if I'm going to be blunt... I don't think your sister even likes him either, she's just super afraid of being alone (which I can get 100%)... I would get her therapy because her self confidence is super super low, and tell her current boyfriend to get to fuck.   Okay, okay, so I know that I will never be cured of schizophrenia and I will most likely have a psychotic episode some time since I'm off of my medication but how long can it take for the psychotic symptoms to come back? I've been off of my medication and I don't feel too bad at all. Usually I would rapid relapse and become psychotic in under a month, but this time seems different. My psychiatrist is always fucking off, I'm seeing my psychologist though but I don't think they know too much about schizophrenia and the medicine. Also, the reason I came off of Seroquel is because it made my functioning a lot worse.   I developed it in my mid teens (I'm not all that old so I've not lived with it for as long as some people like Joseph). Started off with following commands that I heard and feeling paranoid about nearly everyone and everything, and of course, being extremely isolated.   I read somewhere that a good portion of the population have audio hallucinations and the like but don't have schizophrenia (they usually hear their name in the wind or some shit like that), that's probably what he means.   I'd just wait around for the food then leave.   Lately I've noticed that some of my ADHD symptoms have been coming back (I was predominantly inattentive), so I've been thinking about going back to my psychiatrist and asking if I can go back on medication for that also but the only problem is that the stimulant medication was the only meds that worked for me and as you know, stimulants can cause psychosis. Could I technically try the stimulants out again to see if they might work without causes psychosis or am I just putting my health at even more risk? I don't even know if she'll prescribe because of the schizophrenia, but it's causing problems with keeping attention on school stuff that I have to get back into.  Has anyone ever had experience with being on ADHD (stimulant) medication and having a mental illness like schizophrenia, or even bipolar?   Are you dumb?    Pretty sure seroquel blocks serotonin at doses 100mg+, that's probably why he thought it would help.   Yeah, I'm 100% sure sadly.   I've been looking everywhere to see if any doctors or scientists agree that nausea is a form of pain but I can't find anything (especially chronic nausea, like in my case)... I suffer from a mystery stomach condition that makes me nauseas and vomit every day. The nausea is so severe that I'd probably rather be shot in the knee. Basically what I'm asking is, why isn't nausea considered a form of pain when in my experience it's a form of pain?   Euphoria with stimulants, psychedelics and opiates are so vastly different. You obviously like euphoria from stims and stuff more than downers... Different strokes.   The comedown when I was on MPH therapeutically was pretty much just passing out and a headache as far as I can remember but recreationally the come down for MPH is horrendous IME... Thank god my ADHD has pretty much subsided.   I didn't eat at all when I was on them. I would have to come off them at the weekends to actually eat. I went from being happy and emotional to as apathetic as a sociopath. Definitely wasn't a nice experience, and the anxiety was pretty much the worst. I would sweat so badly I could probably give everyone that encountered me a glass of water.   Eh, some people like the methylphenidates over amphetamines... Amphetamines also aren't that recreational at usual doses. I'm talking about how recreational would it be at a therapeutic dosage?   I'm not really sure right now. My symptoms are pretty broad. Gastro disease symptoms are usually pretty broad, as in, symptoms of one thing is also symptoms of another thing.   Were they mushrooms?   Self-medicating will probably make his life go down the shitter. RC's are a shady area because you could be doing well with a good RC and then "BOOM" it's made illegal.    My only problem with this is, isn't ethylphenidate a little more recreational than normal ritalin?   I have schizophrenia and don't medicate anymore (around 2 months off). Medication wont prevent you from making your life go to the "metaphorical" shitter, it'll just be a helpful tool. Being off of medication also wont make your life go down the shitter either, I'm willing to bet you'll make it through, yes you life may be different in 6 months but that doesn't mean that it'll be worse. I had ADHD as well when I was a kid and a teenager, and was on ritalin most of my life and if I'm going to be honest, it sucked. The medication probably MADE my life go down the "shitter". As /u/jepyang said, people make it through this shit all the time and people make it through worse stuff as well, you'll get there, just go through the proper channels whenever you can.   Some people don't like opiates, simple as that. Even though they're the most addictive class of drugs on planet earth, not everyone likes them. Opiate nausea is pretty common before a tolerance builds, then once you've used for a while it kinda comes back (for me anyway, but I have an unknown stomach condition). The euphoria from opiates is different from other drugs, it's a warm, fuzzy feeling and a feeling that everything is just, fine (especially when nodding out). As I said though, not everyone likes them, there's been countless people on opioid painkillers before and never, ever got addicted (or even felt a buzz or liked the buzz) and then there's people out there that gets addicted to them and loves the high.  Maybe you're someone that just doesn't like opiates... Just because they're extremely addictive doesn't mean that everyone loves the feeling, consider it a blessing.   Oh, I thought you meant A E... I'll look into it, but can they do expensive tests like a gastro doctor would be able to do in a hospital? That's the problem, I pretty much need these tests to get treatment.   Thank you, sir.   Yep, the heroin problem is about the same if not worse... I can go to the shop (about 2-5 mins walking distance) and see around 2-3 heroin addicts every time and those are just the ones that are really bad because they've been addicts for decades. Pills on the other hand are probably slightly bigger but definitely nothing like the US, I can find some oxy here and there but mainly the pills consist of prescription stimulants (mainly ritalin), benzodiazepines (namely, valium and temazepam)... Prescription opiates aren't all that big on the streets, because after all, why do we need prescription opiates if we have a shit ton of heroin?   In the US you would either get life or 10 or so years.   He's a badass...   UK. Yep, we do, but I always feel like I'd just waste their time, since I'm not acutely dying.   ... What?   I'm really pissed off mainly because I have to wait probably months to see my stomach doctor again, even though he fucking canceled on me. Anyway, I have an unknown stomach condition as of now because these doctors are so fucking slow, I went from just having diarrhea around 8x a day to having, chronic nausea, bright red blood in my shit, chronic heart burn, feeling full after eating practically nothing, indigestion, stomach pain, burping all the time etc. The nausea itself can be extremely debilitating, and because my GP said that I just had "IBS" a couple of months ago (before all these other symptoms started) I have some person from my college saying that I can't be having all these symptoms that bad, I don't even want to go back to my GP because they're fucking morons, I have to wait for my gastroenterologist which will most likely take months again or go up to the hospital. I wouldn't be surprised if I was fucking dead by the time I go to see them.   APAP can be harsh on some peoples stomachs (not just your liver) and can make some people nauseas even at low doses. Also hydro is a little more nausea inducing than other opiates, like I said, like codeine and morphine... Can you get promethazine OTC in the US? If not, try like 25-50mg Benadryl that can sometimes take the nausea away (and also the itchiness).    Does it have APAP combined with them? If so, then that could be the reason. Also, hydrocodone causes nausea a little more than other opiates, same with codeine and morphine.   I'm willing to bet that you don't really know what the high is like, therefore you don't know what you're looking for. Some people don't even know they're getting high on opiates until they do it a few times.   Go to Russia, right now.   Reading that just gave me heart burn.   Than dying of liver failure? I'd rather withdrawal than die, yikes.   Oh, thanks for the info... That'll be pretty nice to see.   Are they not banning the analogues of methylphenidate all together for 12 months as well?   Dihydroetorphine is technically stronger, depending on ROA.   Most people do, and yes it is stupid but whatever. Not our lives. This is just /r/rant, for you know, ranting.   Calm down.   Have fun... You'll be completely fine, just don't over do it.   Where's my opiate station?   Maybe, just maybe, he wants to do heroin and amphetamine instead.   If God was real then why would he inflict this terrible disease on to anyone?    Body weight doesn't come into dosing with opiates, I believe.   Yeah, show me this acid bath.   I'm pretty sure amphetamine causes you do analyze things a little more deeply but also quicker, so that's probably why it's good for things like Chess or games like CS or CoD because you can make "better" decisions faster.   Another reason why drugs should be legalized. Rest in Peace bropiates.   It depends on where you look but they are fentanyl analogues. For example, carfentanil which is tens of thousands more potent than morphine while heroin is only around 5x more potent, but that's pretty much unusable without overdosing. Fentanyl is also stronger than heroin and is around 100x(ish) more potent than morphine. Ohmefentanyl is also a lot stronger at around 6000x (can reach up to 18000x) more potent than morphine. 3-methylfentanyl is also a lot more potent. But if I was to say what was the most potent I would go with either carfentanil, dihydroetorphine or maybe even ohmefentanyl but these opioids cannot be used in humans because they are that potent, for example, carfentanil is active at around 1ug.  Btw, the way you measure opiate potency is by looking at how more potent it is than morphine.   Always tastes like vinegar for me though.   For sure. Heroin is definitely not even close to the strongest.   Sneezing happens occasionally but because it depends on the person it's not a solid symptom.   Opiate withdrawal will make you feel lethargic/tired but you won't be able to sleep (or if you can, it'll be minimal and low quality). You should expect mild normal opiate withdrawal (since you're tapering) but you should also expect SNRI-like withdrawal because of the tramadol, most common of these symptoms is brain zapping. Also, ask your doctor (if you can) about clonidine, that can be helpful when you're having uncomfortable symptoms, good luck.  [These are the most common symptoms.](http://gyazo.com/700b56e973c8de8040a190465a6df9db)   Or, "I got morphine once in the hospital so I took like 1 - 2 grams of heroin and was totally fine".   Yeah, I smoked weed my whole life and shit and I took like 2 grams of dope and was totally coherent and no one suspected a thing, was only a mild high though. /s   I've had dreams that I done crack and I've never done crack in my life. Every time I took a hit everything would go quiet then everything would pretty much just zap right back in, if that makes sense? Then I would run down to somewhere and look into these mirrors and my pupils would be so big they were coming out of my eyes and shit... Really weird.    Everyone reacts differently to opiates. If you also felt like you couldn't breathe properly then that could've been a major factor.   Yeah I know that fentanyl is extremely potent, that's why I never touched it. I'm doing some pharmacology but the chemistry is definitely something I struggle with, thank you anyway.   You're probably panicking because it's an unfamiliar feeling.   Thanks for answering my question. What's the reason why opiates like morphine are harder to make than things like fentanyl? (I know this might seem like a stupid question).   Question to chemists: How easy would it be to synthesize things like morphine, fentanyl etc?   What? DXM and Ketamine may both be dissociatives but they're not similar chemically (at least I don't think).   Damn, Kris is a shortened version of my name.   I'm usually better at social interaction over the internet or through text as well, but if I know a person irl and I'm speaking to them over text and they start getting emotional, I still don't know how to deal with that or show that I care. Sometimes, I simply don't FEEL like I care but I know in my own thoughts that I care, if that makes any sense? My social interactions no matter what are never really smooth mainly because the things I say don't make sense a lot of the time (especially in person but even through text my words will sometimes still get jumbled and I'll still be at a lose of words 90% of the time).  I've always been kinda cold, distant and detached even before my first psychotic break.   You can delete it yourself.   I always thought heroin had some sort of glamour to it, more than coke to be honest.   God damn it, now I want to ask.   David Nutt ma main man.   Scotland is more progressive than England and pretty much always has been.   [You're goddamn right.](http://weknowgifs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/youre-goddamn-right-gif.gif)   I tend to not agree with a lot of the things on bluelight.   Yeah, why not? They look kinda cool.   You're most likely right, I am in a state of blunted emotions right now. That's probably why, but it just seems like I can never get out of it and that I'll never be able to empathize with someone again.   Thanks for the advice.   Just another post by me, basically writing to myself but also to the sub reddit, like usual. Anyway, I've recently been speaking to someone I was very close to and she's started opening up to me and stuff but the thing is, I have 0 idea how to react to the stuff she says. Like, she'll tell me something really emotional and I'll seem cold and distant, maybe I am cold and distant but I want to try and seem like I'm not, if that makes any sense? It's like when she tells me something really emotional I just won't know how to react to it, hell, I don't even know how to react to stuff that isn't deep and emotional, I just usually send funny pictures to people and joke around that's pretty much the extent of my social skills. I really want to change that but I don't know how.   Does anyone else have experience with this? I know a lot of you probably don't have a lot of social contact (like me, except two people I know in real life and 2-3 people over the internet), but maybe some of you can either relate or help me? Thank you.  Also, this is a progression (or what feels like a progression). As in, it's been getting worse and worse for about a year.   I'm not sure. I kinda knew about them for a long time then I finally started to actually listen to them and now I've been pretty much addicted ever since.   I'm not saying this to make anyone feel special. We're people with an illness, we shouldn't define ourselves because of schizophrenia and think we're special for it. This is just purely information on something.   People panic over apap all the time. If someone takes 4g they automatically think that their liver is turning into a hash brown.    He just wants to expand his mond.  Edit: grammar, after reading his comment my English got fucked up for a sec.   I've been doing some reading about why schizophrenia is so prevalent in modern society even though it seems useless and I've came across a few articles that suggest that schizophrenia may actually be favoured on an evolutionary basis for some odd reason. Some articles suggested that maybe its been favoured because maybe schizophrenics were/are the ones that draw and separate people from the herd (crowd) and allow humans to be more diverse in their thinking, rather than just mindlessly following everyone else. It seems like a good explanation why schizophrenia is so prevalent even though it has great social and human cost.   I hope this doesn't sound either too confusing or insanely stupid, but what do you think about this? I can link the articles if people ask.   Alcoholics are usually extremely malnourished.    Like others have said, you can't force anything. You'll have to wait until he's ready, I've lived with two alcoholic parents and I know all too well that forcing someone into treatment is just a disaster waiting to happen, they won't only resent you but they'll relapse over and over and over. My dad has been in and out of treatment for alcoholism for a little over ten years and the longest he's been sober is around a year, now there's not much hope for him. Just be there when he's ready to get help, don't shun him and don't ever turn him away, once he goes through withdrawal (cold turkey, which isn't sustainable btw, users always go back either before the WD is fully complete or after, they need a maintenance) a few times he'll wonder what he's doing and then he'll truly want help.  Also, you can also try /r/Opiates (even though it's full of addicts posting pics, they can be helpful) and /r/OpiatesRecovery  Good luck!   Whenever I see someone that wears glasses I automatically think they're rapists and I get super triggered.     	103

   **Nuclear deal**    Iran has agreed to reduce by approximately two-thirds its installed centrifuges. Iran will go from having about 19,000 installed today to 6,104 installed under the deal, with only 5,060 of these enriching uranium for 10 years.   -  Iran will have 6,104 centrifuges installed, not 500 to 1,500 as Washington originally wanted as a ceiling or 4,000 as floated by U.S. officials as a possible compromise. 5,000-6,000 centrifuges is enough for a bomb but not sufficient to power a reactor.  Read [The odd reality of Iran's centrifuges: Enough for a bomb, not power](http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2015/feb/25/michael-morell/odd-reality-irans-centrifuges-enough-bomb-not-powe/)  "A ten-fold increase in Irans centrifuge capacity would be required to enrich enough uranium fuel for its Bushehr reactor alone. And no matter how many more centrifuges Iran installs, it can never become self-sufficient because it does not possess adequate uranium ore reserves for a large-scale nuclear energy program."    All excess centrifuges and enrichment infrastructure will be placed in IAEA monitored storage and will be used only as replacements for operating centrifuges and equipment.  -  Iran can keep the remaining 12,896 centrifuges   -  Irans breakout timeline  the time that it would take for Iran to acquire enough fissile material for one weapon  is currently assessed to be 2 to 3 months. That timeline will be extended to at least one year, for a duration of at least ten years, under this framework.  -  Obama's bare minimum would have extended nuclear breakout to at least 10 years, they settled for the one year nuclear breakout.  Looks to me like a horrible deal.      In short   http://i.imgur.com/Oi9PBKz.gifv /s    http://i.imgur.com/Oi9PBKz.gifv   [Here is most probably why](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/317ven/iran_nuclear_deal_reached_after_eight_straight/cpzg8hs)   **ELI5** Is it a deal or not?  details are still subject to negotiation, **and nothing is agreed until everything is agreed**   Read [The odd reality of Iran's centrifuges: Enough for a bomb, not power](http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2015/feb/25/michael-morell/odd-reality-irans-centrifuges-enough-bomb-not-powe/)   Morell told PunditFact he said 5,000 because that was lowest number he had heard was in play. The number of centrifuges in place today is a hair over 20,000, and a likely goal is to cut that to about 5,000. But Morells basic point struck us as just plain intriguing. We wanted to learn more about this idea that a nuclear power program would require many more centrifuges than youd need for a bomb -- which by extension means that limiting centrifuge capacity is just one negotiating point out of many.  -  Bottom line: Making bombs takes fewer centrifuges. And without a lot of centrifuges, its hard to make nuclear power. For the record, some centrifuge models are better than others, so that's also a factor.  Today, Iran has just one nuclear power station, the plant at Bushehr that it bought from the Russians. To keep that facility running, Iran would need to increase its centrifuge capacity ten-fold. A steady supply of fuel from Russia is what keeps Bushehr online.   How could it have improved?  I feel like the only things that would satisfy some people..  A nuclear deal as originally floated by Obama and Washington. Read what you just commented on.   Correct. They are most likely   a bunch on Iranian expats in Denmark having a drink.  But she tweeted that they were from Tehran.  This was her first tweet  https://twitter.com/MishaZand/status/583697346837483520  followed by a response to her own tweet  https://twitter.com/MishaZand/status/583719052679507968  At the very least she is intentionally deceiving..    I knew that, but you get arrested for drinking in public (and private too). I think it's propaganda.  Edit: She tweeted that it was from Tehran. See thread.

These elements form the foundation upon which the final text of the JCPOA will be written between now and June 30, and reflect the significant progress that has been made in discussions between the P5+1, the European Union, and Iran. Important implementation details are still subject to negotiation, and nothing is agreed until everything is agreed. We will work to conclude the JCPOA based on these parameters over the coming months.   ---  **Enrichment**     Iran has agreed to reduce by approximately two-thirds its installed centrifuges. Iran will go from having about 19,000 installed today to 6,104 installed under the deal, with only 5,060 of these enriching uranium for 10 years. All 6,104 centrifuges will be IR-1s, Irans first-generation centrifuge.   Iran has agreed to not enrich uranium over 3.67 percent for at least 15 years.   Iran has agreed to reduce its current stockpile of about 10,000 kg of low-enriched uranium (LEU) to 300 kg of 3.67 percent LEU for 15 years.   All excess centrifuges and enrichment infrastructure will be placed in IAEA monitored storage and will be used only as replacements for operating centrifuges and equipment.   Iran has agreed to not build any new facilities for the purpose of enriching uranium for 15 years.   Irans breakout timeline  the time that it would take for Iran to acquire enough fissile material for one weapon  is currently assessed to be 2 to 3 months. That timeline will be extended to at least one year, for a duration of at least ten years, under this framework.   --- **Iran will convert its facility at Fordow so that it is no longer used to enrich uranium**     Iran has agreed to not enrich uranium at its Fordow facility for at least 15 years.   Iran has agreed to convert its Fordow facility so that it is used for peaceful purposes only  into a nuclear, physics, technology, research center.   Iran has agreed to not conduct research and development associated with uranium enrichment at Fordow for 15 years.   Iran will not have any fissile material at Fordow for 15 years.  2   Almost two-thirds of Fordows centrifuges and infrastructure will be removed. The remaining centrifuges will not enrich uranium. All centrifuges and related infrastructure will be placed under IAEA monitoring.   ---  **Iran will only enrich uranium at the Natanz facility, with only 5,060 IR-1 first-generation centrifuges for ten years.**   Iran has agreed to only enrich uranium using its first generation (IR-1 models) centrifuges at Natanz for ten years, removing its more advanced centrifuges.   Iran will remove the 1,000 IR-2M centrifuges currently installed at Natanz and place them in IAEA monitored storage for ten years.   Iran will not use its IR-2, IR-4, IR-5, IR-6, or IR-8 models to produce enriched uranium for at least ten years. Iran will engage in limited research and development with its advanced centrifuges, according to a schedule and parameters which have been agreed to by the P5+1.   For ten years, enrichment and enrichment research and development will be limited to ensure a breakout timeline of at least 1 year. Beyond 10 years, Iran will abide by its enrichment and enrichment R D plan submitted to the IAEA, and pursuant to the JCPOA, under the Additional Protocol resulting in certain limitations on enrichment capacity.   ---  **Inspections and Transparency**   The IAEA will have regular access to all of Irans nuclear facilities, including to Irans enrichment facility at Natanz and its former enrichment facility at Fordow, and including the use of the most up-to-date, modern monitoring technologies.   Inspectors will have access to the supply chain that supports Irans nuclear program. The new transparency and inspections mechanisms will closely monitor materials and/or components to prevent diversion to a secret program.   Inspectors will have access to uranium mines and continuous surveillance at uranium mills, where Iran produces yellowcake, for 25 years.   Inspectors will have continuous surveillance of Irans centrifuge rotors and bellows production and storage facilities for 20 years. Irans centrifuge manufacturing base will be frozen and under continuous surveillance.   All centrifuges and enrichment infrastructure removed from Fordow and Natanz will be placed under continuous monitoring by the IAEA.   A dedicated procurement channel for Irans nuclear program will be established to monitor and approve, on a case by case basis, the supply, sale, or transfer to Iran of  3 certain nuclear-related and dual use materials and technology  an additional transparency measure.   Iran has agreed to implement the Additional Protocol of the IAEA, providing the IAEA much greater access and information regarding Irans nuclear program, including both declared and undeclared facilities.   Iran will be required to grant access to the IAEA to investigate suspicious sites or allegations of a covert enrichment facility, conversion facility, centrifuge production facility, or yellowcake production facility anywhere in the country.   Iran has agreed to implement Modified Code 3.1 requiring early notification of construction of new facilities.   Iran will implement an agreed set of measures to address the IAEAs concerns regarding the Possible Military Dimensions (PMD) of its program.   ---  **Reactors and Reprocessing**   Iran has agreed to redesign and rebuild a heavy water research reactor in Arak, based on a design that is agreed to by the P5+1, which will not produce weapons grade plutonium, and which will support peaceful nuclear research and radioisotope production.   The original core of the reactor, which would have enabled the production of significant quantities of weapons-grade plutonium, will be destroyed or removed from the country.   Iran will ship all of its spent fuel from the reactor out of the country for the reactors lifetime.   Iran has committed indefinitely to not conduct reprocessing or reprocessing research and development on spent nuclear fuel.   Iran will not accumulate heavy water in excess of the needs of the modified Arak reactor, and will sell any remaining heavy water on the international market for 15 years.   Iran will not build any additional heavy water reactors for 15 years.   ---  **Sanctions**   Iran will receive sanctions relief, if it verifiably abides by its commitments.   U.S. and E.U. nuclear-related sanctions will be suspended after the IAEA has verified that Iran has taken all of its key nuclear-related steps. If at any time Iran fails to fulfill its commitments, these sanctions will snap back into place.  4   The architecture of U.S. nuclear-related sanctions on Iran will be retained for much of the duration of the deal and allow for snap-back of sanctions in the event of significant non-performance.   All past UN Security Council resolutions on the Iran nuclear issue will be lifted simultaneous with the completion, by Iran, of nuclear-related actions addressing all key concerns (enrichment, Fordow, Arak, PMD, and transparency).   However, core provisions in the UN Security Council resolutions  those that deal with transfers of sensitive technologies and activities  will be re-established by a new UN Security Council resolution that will endorse the JCPOA and urge its full implementation. It will also create the procurement channel mentioned above, which will serve as a key transparency measure. Important restrictions on conventional arms and ballistic missiles, as well as provisions that allow for related cargo inspections and asset freezes, will also be incorporated by this new resolution.   A dispute resolution process will be specified, which enables any JCPOA participant, to seek to resolve disagreements about the performance of JCPOA commitments.   If an issue of significant non-performance cannot be resolved through that process, then all previous UN sanctions could be re-imposed.   U.S. sanctions on Iran for terrorism, human rights abuses, and ballistic missiles will remain in place under the deal.   --- **Phasing**   For ten years, Iran will limit domestic enrichment capacity and research and development  ensuring a breakout timeline of at least one year. Beyond that, Iran will be bound by its longer-term enrichment and enrichment research and development plan it shared with the P5+1.   For fifteen years, Iran will limit additional elements of its program. For instance, Iran will not build new enrichment facilities or heavy water reactors and will limit its stockpile of enriched uranium and accept enhanced transparency procedures.   Important inspections and transparency measures will continue well beyond 15 years. Irans adherence to the Additional Protocol of the IAEA is permanent, including its significant access and transparency obligations. The robust inspections of Irans uranium supply chain will last for 25 years.   Even after the period of the most stringent limitations on Irans nuclear program, Iran will remain a party to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), which prohibits Irans development or acquisition of nuclear weapons and requires IAEA safeguards on its nuclear program.  5 ###     ________http://online.wsj.com/public/resources/documents/IranDealParameters04022015.pdf - PDF   Reddit should do an AMA with [/u/cameneyeha](https://www.reddit.com/user/cameneyeha) who just time-traveled back to 18:09:24 GMT-0400 04/02/2015.

This was not a Johns Hopkins study. Johns Hopkins did not initiate, pay for, direct or conduct the study in Guatemala. No nonprofit university or hospital has ever been held liable for a study conducted by the U.S. government.     It has been well established by a Presidential Commission that this unconscionable research was funded and executed by the United States government. The President, U.S. Secretary of State and U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services have apologized to the Guatemalan government and to all affected.    plaintiffs essential claim in this case is that prominent Johns Hopkins faculty members participation on a government committee that reviewed funding applications was tantamount to conducting the research itself and that therefore Johns Hopkins should be held liable. Neither assertion is true.    A class action lawsuit seeking to hold federal officials responsible for the Guatemala study has been filed and dismissed. U.S. District Court Judge Reggie Walton dismissed that action in 2012 and stated that the pleas of victims for relief are more appropriately directed to the political branches of the federal government.    For more than half a century since the time of the Guatemala study, scholars, ethicists and clinicians have worked with government officials to establish rigorous ethical standards for human research. Johns Hopkins welcomes bioethical inquiry into the U.S. government's Guatemala study and its legacy. This lawsuit, however, is an attempt by plaintiffs counsel to exploit a historic tragedy for monetary gain. Plaintiffs legal claims are not supported by the facts.   We will vigorously defend the lawsuit.  [**A Letter to the Johns Hopkins Community - April 1, 2015-**](http://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/guatemala_study/) -  **SUBJECT: Challenges from the past** -  Dear Member of the Johns Hopkins Community,  More than 60 years ago, the U.S. government conducted an unconscionable and unethical experiment in Guatemala, in which U.S. government researchers deliberately infected vulnerable citizens of Guatemala with syphilis and other infectious diseases. We feel profound sympathy for the individuals and families impacted by this deplorable study.  When the details of this study came to light, a Presidential Commission determined that the Guatemala Study was funded and conducted by the United States government. In 2010, the President of the United States, the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Health and Human Services apologized to all affected. In 2012, a federal district court concluded that the pleas of victims for relief are more appropriately directed to the political branches of the federal government.  Today, attorneys representing Guatemalan plaintiffs announced that they are suing The Johns Hopkins University and Johns Hopkins Health System, alleging that Johns Hopkins was responsible for the study. The plaintiffs essential claim in this case is that prominent Johns Hopkins faculty members participation on a government committee that reviewed funding applications was tantamount to conducting the research itself, and therefore that Johns Hopkins should be held liable.   Neither assertion is true.  This was not a Johns Hopkins study. Johns Hopkins did not initiate, pay for, direct or conduct the study in Guatemala. Participation in the review of government research was then and is today separate from being a Johns Hopkins employee, and no nonprofit university or hospital has ever been held liable for a study conducted by the U.S. government.   As a leading global research university, Johns Hopkins values rigorous and open scrutiny of history, even when it is complex and uncomfortable.  We know that historians have previously linked prominent Johns Hopkins faculty members in various ways to other unethical government research studies in Tuskegee and Terre Haute. Although separate from the Guatemala lawsuit, these studies were all deplorable and all demand reflection upon the broader legacy of unethical research. It is important to confront and learn from the past.  At the same time, we cannot let unfounded allegations go unchallenged. We will defend the institution vigorously in court against legal responsibility for the governments Guatemala study.  If you would like more information about the universitys position on the lawsuit, we have released a media statement that you can find here, along with information about the Presidential Commission on the research in Guatemala and its findings.

He marked it as SECRET-CONFIDENTIAL and edited out identifying details.635 The Final Syphilis Report is dated November 1955. **No evidence shows that the syphilis or ghonorrhea reports were provided to anyone**.636 While the results of the serological experiments were published in several different articles,637 and the intentional exposure experiments were referred to indirectly in later publications,638 the Commission found no evidence that Dr. Cutlers final reports or the results of the exposure and prophylaxis experiments were submitted for peer review or published. There are several published examples in which Dr. Cutler discusses data from these experiments but misleadingly cites another published study. In these cases, the published study cited does not actually support the data presented.639 In addition, the Guatemala experiments are notably absent from historical reviews of STD research authored by the researchers.640 An enormous amount of money, time, and effort went into the Guatemala experiments, and the exact motivations for hiding the results is unclear, particularly because the VDRL researchers published widely on their research activities, including other STD intentional inoculation  -Source:  ["Ethically Impossible" STD Research in Guatemala from 1946 to 1948- PDF](http://bioethics.gov/sites/default/files/Ethically%20Impossible%20%28with%20linked%20historical%20documents%29%202.7.13.pdf)  It wasn't untill 2009 that the report was peer reviewed   http://www.hhs.gov/1946inoculationstudy/cdc_rept-std_inoc_study.html   at least provide a link to evidence, or not use such inflammatory language.

Here it is in quoted text   [u/Horus420I](https://www.reddit.com/user/Horus420I) know nothing about that, care to elaborate?    Most if not all of the remaining Jews' in Yemen are anti-Zionist due to the secular nature of the State of Israel . Their Rabbi has made this clear multiple times and their actions demonstrate his truthfulness. This hasn't helped them one iota and is solid proof that Houthi attacks (or any attack -  AQAP, radical etc.) are of anti-Semitic nature not anti-Zionist.   In January 2007, Houthi (Ansar-allah) leaders threatened the Jewish families in Saada and Raida (about 400 people at the time), "We warn you to leave the area immediately... We give you a period of 10 days, or you will regret it."  The entire community fled to the capital where the President of Yemen gave the Jews protection in the Jewish quarter in Alafi Qaa, Sanna.   The Houthis then destroyed their homes, sanctuaries, cars, took their money and property.  They took over Yemen's Jewish library which also holds many antique Jewish manuscripts and a very ancient and rare Torah scroll.  Over time most of Yemen's  remaining 400 Jews  escaped to the United States, Argentina and Israel. As of now there are only about 90 Jews left in the whole Yemen. The remaining 90 did not want to leave. Now even if they change their mind it's too late.   There were multiple incidents of hand-grenade attacks assault. Pelted by rocks, harassment and threatening SMS msgs could be expected as a daily occurrence. (I'm leaving out a few deadly AQAP inspired or radical attacks)  Two months ago two Jewish boys in Sanna were beaten by Houthis and forced to convert to Islam by praying the Shahadah (There is no god but God, Muhammad...) to their prophet Mohammed.    Just last week a few Jewish Yemenite boys tried escaping Yemen through the airport but were turned  back and badly beaten.  This is just a few attacks that I know about. There were many more.  Edit: here's an article from 2007   http://www.reuters.com/article/2007/05/08/us-yemen-jews-idUSL0740222720070508       they are trying to fight corruption in the Government  What about attacking Yemenite Jews?

 That's nasty    Don't be salty about it   Or just people who like the game   Messi   Tf      Still applies    So people know what we are talking about             A simple Atwood's machine is shown in the diagram above. It is composed of a frictionless lightweight pulley with two cubes connected by a light string. If cube A has a mass of 4.0 kg and cube B has a mass of 6.0 kg, the system will move such that cube B accelerates downwards. What would be the tension in the two parts of the string between the pulley and the cubes?       what? The game is in dc this sunday at rfk. EDIT: sorry second leg is home   pks please   finally, now win red bulls so we can kick your asses   Henry, how you feel?   Idc who wins I just wanna feel the emotion of pks   We'll win regardless   Damn, I was hoping for pks   Racism is racism, we should not tolerate it at any level. If we do we are teaching our kids racism is ok.      Regardless it doesn't matter if he was black it didn't add to the story he literally said it for no reason.    I've had a black admin in all my schools with less than 25% black population.    How many schools have you attended for your assumption that blacks aren't principles?       I just asked why mention he's black I did not once mention I was black. I'm saying don't ignore the problem just because you don't see it doesn't mean it doesn't happen.    Because it doesn't matter   If he was white he probably wouldn't have said anything. It's small things that create racism. Sure mentioning he's black was harmless and maybe he was just being descriptive but he probably just mentioned he was black because it's not a generally a black profession and it's isolating blacks as whole. Who cares if he was black or white there was literally no point in saying it. If he cares that much about how it looked he could watch the gif himself.   Why did you mention that he was black? EDIT: instead of down voting how about adding to the conversation instead of down voting.    My school has a iPhone group chat for every sport except football that I know of   They probably can afford to buy them but just so you know I only know about 5-6 people who still actively uses Facebook out of about 100-140   They both have private messaging, also it's not hard to take a screenshot of a wall of text and post it as a substitute of the character limit.

 If reducing clearance is the goal, then you shouldn't be using single wall pipe.  Double wall stove pipe only requires 6" clearance, allowing you to put the stove as close to the wall as you want without requiring an additional shield.  OP's wall looks great, but most heat shields are a black piece of tin on the wall. Most installations look much nicer without a shield.   The woodstove they installed is UL certified with a specific clearance requirement.  As long as the minimum clearance is met, there is no need for an air gap to try and reduce clearance further.  Most modern stoves only have 4"-6" clearance requirements off the back and sides, making additional shields unnecessary.   Shields are great for uncertified appliances that require 48" clearance to combustibles though.   The other one that comes to mind immediately is for the police officer that went unpunished after he killed a kid while driving 120kph in a 50 zone.  But there wasn't a jury in that case, and i believe they're reviewing it, so I guess it doesn't apply.   The trial was not about whether or not he killed Jun Lin, but whether or not he had the sense of mind to know what he was doing. Magnotta admitted to killing Jun Lin, but that his state of mind was so psychotic that he didn't know what he was doing was wrong.   Multiple psychiatrists testified for the defense saying that they felt his schizophrenia was to blame. The obvious planning seemed to prove otherwise for the prosecution.   I think this is the right decision and I'm very relieved that they jury came to it. Especially after a variety of fucked up decisions by Quebec juries recently.    There is case that just closed in Quebec where an officer in an unmarked car was driving 122 kph in a 50 zone.  He killed a 5 year old boy when he struck the car.  Apparently he was not in pursuit of anyone and was on his way to relieve a surveillance team somewhere. There was no rush. He wasn't even sentenced to community hours, just walked away free of charges.   Some jobs take more than two weeks to complete, like a bathroom or a kitchen. Not to mention they cost thousands of dollars and most people can't afford to do multiple expensive jobs at one time. I would revise this to say that you should tackle the small things at the get go, but save up for the big stuff.     You sound exactly like my mechanic, looking at Lexus now.       I've noticed this in the past, but am currently watching US Open replays for today.   As someone that lives in Montreal, but works North of the city, I see the traffic headed in every single day. Fortunately I get to drive by at 120 and wave.  	10
 Social media is the new customer support    That's surprising. Aren't gag orders issued by a judge in a court case so as not to taint the jury? The gov can't just order gag orders willy-nilly,  can it?    An excellent resource is memrise.com   so you're posting from the afterlife?   Hey! Ireland is not England.    Are you saying the Internet is wrong?    Maybe the technology was bought by a telecom and the silence being part of an NDA deal. If it was the government he'd be more likely to protest or complain about the decision    I disagree.  the Internet is a global network that needs international cooperation. That doesn't go against him saying it's a necessity.    I see it as a tactical move to get the results he - and his constituents- want, not a dishonest one. It's pretty clear what issues he stands for and he much more consistent than most politicians. It's what I like about Sanders too. Clinton on the other hand is a typical "go with the wind" politician who will say one thing today and do another thing tomorrow    - Japanese kanji will help with reading/writing but nothing else.  - Mandarin, definitely.  - Individual tutor (with a native speaker) definitely more effective if you can afford it, but I would combine that with *small* group classes for added variety.  - set yourself vocabulary goals and stick to them.  - Don't spend too much time learning to *write* characters; you won't often need to write by hand (computers and phones use pinyin), and it's time-consuming (though perhaps easier for you if you're good at kanji). Reading is much more important.   - Chinese is interesting historically, culturally and politically, and well worth learning.    And yet, Japan, France and Germany can provide excellent healthcare without having to resort to this.    Can't make a perfect system that works for everyone. ACA isn't very good but it's better than what was before it.    True but at least it's a step in the right direction as insurance is much cheaper than paying out of pocket when you have a serious illness or accident. Making care affordable would require the type of government intervention that is anathema to most Americans.    The problem is also lack of competition. If the cost of producing X widget is too high another business will see the opportunity and enter the market at a lower price to capture market share. With health care, the barrier to entry is so high that's not really an option. And smaller markets can't support multiple competitors, especially for specialized care. (GPs can be more competitive and this is why they don't make as much money and no one wants to be one)  This is why free market models don't work for health care and it should be regulated to avoid price gouging just like the state does with basic utilities. I favor free markets but this is one case where Europe and Japan definitely have it right.    Trademarks are not global and they don't cover social media accounts.    Why should Instagram get involved in this case? You have to work it out directly with the account holder. It sucks, yeah, but you should have taken the name before someone else did.     If they lose customers they lose advertisers and their business. Thus, customer service.    Sure, back then, when they had no ads/revenue. But they're now owned by FB$$$ and have ads so yeah customer service is expected.   	18

He was in no way your father other than biologically, but the story didn't finish yet. Now it is.    That's what hurts.   How did he stick his head in the collider? Aren't they supposed to run in a vacuum?   well i'd imagine most hard drugs must have some kind of appeal if some people are willing to destroy themselves and everything they hold dear for one more hit.    I had problems with addiction in my past.  Generally at this point you descrine doing the drug of choices isn't fun anymore, you chase those first highs when you felt amazing and awesome, but it's never ever the same. You kind of get satisfied for a bit and then crave more, and more, until you have no drug left and then you feel like fucking shit. Then you go and buy more, and the cycle repeats.    You can't stop doing the drug but not because it feels super awesome, but rather because not using feels like fucking hell to an addict.         Hahaha I don't normaly comment on how good a comment is, but this is the best whoosh GIF I've seen by far   Whoosh   I'm trying to think outside the box here, I know this question is probably really stupid, but how do we know is mass causing gravity instead of lack of "no-mass"? I mean, suppose that empty space pushes you evenly in every direction, so, you stay stationary. But put an object with mass close enough to you to interfere with that pushing force, and you start going towards that object, because now your receive the pushing force from one side more than other.    Does that make any kind of sense?    Well, towards the end of the 90s (1998) it was discovered that the expansion of the universe is (very contrary to the belief in that time) occurring at an accelerating rate. Before that it was thought that galaxies moved away from each other more slowly as time passed, but since 1998 we know it's not, they move away faster and faster, and will continue to do so. One of the most accepted theories to explain this weird effect from the universe is the Dark Energy Theory, but it's 1:15am here and I'm about to sleep, so I'll leave that to another redditor or go into it a bit more tomorrow.   These two, both from /r/AskReddit:  -[What is the scariest theory known to man?](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/31nbca/whats_the_scariest_theory_known_to_man/)     -[[Serious] [NSFW] Redditors who have been on the brink of death/legally dead, can you describe what it felt like?](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/2qmt72/serious_nsfw_redditors_who_have_been_on_the_brink/)   Both had very deep and mindblowing questions. I particularly like the one from the redditors who have died, because most of them talk about the acceptance of death in those final moments, and brings my mind at peace knowing that maybe in those few last instants, I'll be ok with what's happening.   The ultimate paternity test   Fuck.   Dude that's the wrong song, you put Darude - Sandstorm   "Just remember though, the old, happy, not depressed you is still in there. Somewhere.

I needed to read that. Thank you.    I bet it was caustic soda, here in Argentina something similar happened, a girl drank a cocktail that had some of caustic soda in it and burned the shit out of her, but luckily she instantly spitted it and survived IIRC. She was hospitalised a few weeks though, that shit burns like nothing.   That's exactly my point, it's real, way too real, and I like this drama but after a bit dose of it I need some stupidshit drama to cool down a little.

You sound like a wonderful group   Man, I'm all for the human approach, but when I read things like *"Matthew was in hysterics  traumatised.

I mean, seeing it on TV, I was poor as fuck, but still, the nostalgia is strong.   I have Senn HD202, and the first couple of times I wore them backwards, then realised and changed it, but from the design they have the first reaction seems to put them wrong. I also saw a lot of people who used mines wore them backwards at first.

You can tell by the positioning of the hand and the arm tattoo, they are shot from a little bit different angles.    I found it very funny, can I upload it to my Facebook?

Damn, that took long to find.   *One million walkers!*   Hahaha I lost it at the arm falling on top of the crates   Are you Warlizard from the Warlizard Gaming Forums?   Seems like it isn't my best day commenting   You're saying that a teacher advicing students to study, because otherwise they won't meet the knowledge to approve the class is a threat. I believe you need to learn the concept of threat, because with that logic every advice in "don't do X because Y (bad thing) is going to happen to you" form is a threat to you.       As other people said, if he's doing this out of pure justice seeking, he should also in all the other "sellers" that aren't registered as well. Besides, being in the legal right doesn't mean it isn't a dick move, OP may face jailtime because a very stupid thing.    I think you need to learn the meaning of the word "threat", man.   Thanks for the correction! I don't know why people are downvoting you, you were right, I meant peek, not peak.   Also depending on the direction in which you turned our it, you may have sent it backwards. Try remembering a few days back.   Click it... You know you want to... Just a quick ~~peak~~peek, no one will know, it'll be out secret...   So, according to that logic if a teacher tells her students "if you don't study you are going to fail the class", she's threatening them. Please, stop saying ridiculous things, I'm not treathing anyone.   Yeah I think I'm on the wrong internet again   I'm not threatening anyone, I'm saying what I'm reading, if this guy gets a bad rep *(he certainly is at least in this subreddit, and it isn't a stretch to think this will be mentioned in other MTG forums)* it will impact badly on his sales, how's that a threat?   I've seen a lot of comments complaining about this, the option is there in control settings. In Spanish it has a misleading name (something that in English would translate to "previous car weapon", in Spanish it sounds like it's taking about in-car-built weapons) and assuming the amount of comments I'm seeing here about this matter I'm assuming it also does on English.    It's among the top 5, just set it to mouse wheel down and you can go back and forth with pistols, grenades, etc on your car with your wheel. Pretty useful, I don't know why this isn't default.    Cheers!   I'm pretty sure you are doing this in order to get money from Tobias, but I can see why you are and will continue to deny this.   You will say that money isn't your primary interest in this course of action, but you know it is. Look, I'm not looking for you to admit it, I'm just saying that you and everyone else here know what's this about. So, I'm going to tell you that besides this being the biggest jerk move I've heard in quite some time, and apart from me criticizing the lack of ethics in your actions (which clearly is a topic you don't care about), I'm going to speak your language: this is a terrible, terrible decision economically-wise for your business.       Reddit is a huge platform, and you should consider that gaining bad reputation here can really hurt your business. And I mean **really**. The word will come out and a lot of people in the MTG niche will stop buying from you, and as I know you don't care about justice or whatever justification you want to tag on this dick move, but only about gaining more money, I am telling you this is one of the worst ways to accomplish that. You may gain some cash from OP, but that's nothing compared to what you will lose against a angry community that will boicott your operation by not buying anymore.    So, in the slim chance you'll reply to this, I know you are going to say money isn't your goal here etc etc. But yeah, you, me, and everyone else here knows that's just gibberish. Consider what I'm saying to you, it's in your business best interest.  	105

 It is interesting that there are some games, like F/SN, that are longer than the Bible. (The NIV translation of the Bible clocks in at 726,109 words)   That isn't even the largest amount of words in a literary work. The Wheel of Time series has 4,410,036 words. (Yes, that is 4.4+ million words)   The light novel has been translated father than the manga and there is even the anime which is starting in the beginning of July.   That is why we no longer use capes!   Off the top of my head:  Attack on Titan, Log Horizon, Full Metal Alchemist: Brotherhood, Baccano, Kekkai Sensen, Psycho Pass (Some questionable content in first episode), Zetsuen no Tempest, Xam'd: Lost Memories (This was released in the US before it was in Japan as it was, originally, exclusive to PSN),  last but not least ~~Space Dandy~~. (Forgot about the take on Hooters)   There is also [T-Rex no Kanojo](http://myanimelist.net/manga/88537/T-Rex_na_Kanojo), which is pretty good but there aren't too many chapters out.  You might want to check out the [recommendations on MAL from Monster Musume.](http://myanimelist.net/manga/36213/Monster_Musume_no_Iru_Nichijou/userrecs)   Why limit yourself to one? You are dealing with a genie, ask for more! (Well, not too much as you want to avoid flooding the market)   It is about the same amount of text as the main Lord of the Rings Trilogy which sits about ~470000 words.  Witcher 3 has less text than Final Fantasy VII which has ~600000 words.   The person you replied to is the guy who is making it.   I know for R;B1 they kept the main plot points but reworked the scenes enough that people consider it to be two separate games.  EDIT: They also revamped the graphics and replaced some of the characters. [The Wikipedia entry about it goes into more detail.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperdimension_Neptunia_%28video_game%29#Hyperdimension_Neptunia_Re.3BBirth_1)   It is half off as well so if you've played the first it might be a good idea to pick it up now.   I just started R;B1, so I'm not sure how R;B2 changed in terms of combat and what not.   Depends on a number of things:  * Number of hunts fought in,  * Looted gear  * Raids/Dungeons run   * First time bonus in raids/dungeons  * Progress on Relic weapon  * etc...  Thankfully, the game doesn't require an instantaneous jump from i50 to i90 as the 3 main raids (LOTA, ST, WoD) are (i50, i70, i90 respectively)  I'd say about 20-30 hours of gameplay. (Maybe more, maybe less, depends on the amount of grind you want to do within a period of time.)   Worked for me! I tried it last time they did a promo, but it had ended so I hadn't made an account.   The only identification you have to provide is your SSN, which is used for tax purposes.

Here is the link: http://myanimelist.net/animelist/Zombiex100   While it isn't an anime, *Ready Player One* will be getting adapted as a movie and Steven Spielberg will be directing it.   [Source](http://www.engadget.com/2015/03/25/spielberg-directing-ready-player-one/)   To give people an idea on the length (word count):  * Lord of the Rings (Main Trilogy Only): ~470,000  * Final Fantasy VII: ~600,000  * Mistborn Trilogy: 693,428  * Bible (NIV): 726,109  * F/SN VN: 820,595 (Based upon the English word count)  * --- UBW Route: 219,495  * Wheel of Time series: **4,410,036** (This is not a typo)   "[Isekai no Seikishi Monogatari](http://myanimelist.net/anime/5781/Isekai_no_Seikishi_Monogatari)" would be a perfect fit.   No, you're right.   "Row-ri" would be a passable pronunciation of it, but you would have to keep in mind that it would be the "Ro" from "Row" without the "w" at the end. Technically, it is closer to "R-ri"   The reason for it is that an "o" followed by an "u" is pronounced by holding the "o" sound for another syllable length rather than saying "o" then "u" and it is denoted by the smaller katakana (or hiragana should it be in hiragana).    Not so much a song, but an artist. I recently found out about the Vitamin String Quartet and they have been doing string covers of popular songs and some original stuff, they have ~250 albums out all focusing of a different artist or album that they are covering.   A friend used their music during their wedding and I can't stop listening to their stuff.   You could always send it through Waifu2x and have it upscale the image. (It does it a lot better and without as much detail lost as photoshop would incur.)  EDIT: Got back to my computer, [here](https://i.imgur.com/flHpNno.jpg) is the upscaled image.   It is a parody of the racing scenes from the anime *Initial D*.   What about powerline ethernet adapters? That is data going across power lines!   Apparently it did happen.   How about on the backs of hippos?   There is always /r/trueanime but that is a smaller community.   Pac-Man was also in the Mario Kart arcade games.   It will be interesting to see how this compares to *Ballroom e Youkoso* in the portrayal of dancing. BeY is such that even I, who isn't even athletic at all, want to try ballroom dancing as it appears to be more than what most people think of it.   EDIT: Fixed tense of a word.   I'm not too surprised. Yeah, getting the rights to the lyrics would be a pain but musically it fits.   It may cause the manga to become dated quicker but it is a great song choice. They used a song that is popular enough that people can remember bits and pieces from a few lyrics along with the swelling music in the climax.    As the question has inherent spoilers, could you please mark the text in your post accordingly?   I managed to find a copy of the Final Fantasy: Anthology for PS1 today at a local store but much to my detriment, FFV seems to crash 50-75% of the time when saving which will make it difficult or impossible to progress.  What can I do to fix it? I've tried turning off smoothing and such to no avail.  I was able to save once, but other than that it will always go to a black screen when saving.   ---  If there isn't a fix, I guess I could hook my up my old PS2 and play it that way. My concern is that with how most TVs are forgoing the composite/component connectors it would be a stop gap for about a decade or so and the FF series is something I'd like to keep around for longer than that.   It can't hurt to ask as the most they would say is no, especially with the amount of time that you had put in on the game.   Quoting /u/koredozo's above comment.   Per one of the tweet replies: "There's a vendor you can buy gear from named Monst3r. There's about a 1/500 chance Ryan appears instead"   I think a mod commented in a thread last week that they remove any top-level comments that are less than 100 characters as they are normally low quality.   The lighting on the second to last photo is phenomenal as it gives an entirely different tone/look to the figure .   I'm surprised that they didn't get the rights to have the original song in there. Heck, it is on Disc 2 of the GuP OST as well so I'd think that getting the rights to the OST would cover it.   I think that max score was cheated anyways since all of the closest ones are half that.   It could be the reddit hug of death as people are going on to upscale/denoise their images.   I didn't have it do an upscale, just a denoise on an image and it dealt really well with the gradients in the background and the details though some information is lost. Then again, this is zoomed in at about 300% actual size so it is negligible.  [Left is before, right is after](https://i.imgur.com/KkY7FXI.jpg)   It wasn't hard to do. All I did was utilize a machine learning program that someone created with the purpose of upscaling anime/manga related images (such as fanart and what not) and it does it really really well.   [Here is a less blurry one at 1080x1920](https://i.imgur.com/Z4kLAhD.png). I used the waifu2x site to upscale the original and then used gimp and increased the canvas size.   [Here](https://i.imgur.com/lzi3td5.jpg) is a larger version than the 1080p one if you'd like.   So basically you want us to sign up using the only link which is a referral link so that we are now the suckers who are trying to make money/games from this and all you do is sit back and profit from it.  Yeah, no.   It is a car without the obvious police livery/decals, but it still sports the obvious things such as a spotlight, multiple radio antennas, bar lights (those there are normally inside the car) and so on.   [Here you go.](https://i.imgur.com/cjEsPVR.png) I utilized a deep convolutional neural network that was trained over 3000+ anime/manga related images to resize the original and then used GIMP to get the finalized image size since the program could only do 1.6 or 2x the original resolution.   [Direct link](http://waifu2x.udp.jp)  [Source Code](https://github.com/nagadomi/waifu2x)      You need to save the page, for some reason you can't directly save it. Try doing File - Save Page As.   It is also really good at removing jpeg noise from an image. This will make some of my .jpg wallpapers usable since I won't see as much, if any, of the artifacting. Case in point, [left is before, right is after](https://i.imgur.com/KkY7FXI.jpg).   Yep, CUDA is Nvidia graphics cards only.   It seems as though he fed a natural learning program that is designed to read and produce images a few thousand anime related images to learn from. From that it seems to recreate the image rather than simply touching it up.  Case in point, it removed a lot of noise from a pretty complex wallpaper that I had. [Left is before, Right is after](https://imgur.com/KkY7FXI)   Could you please mark the spoilers?   Clannad and subsequently Clannad ~After Story~, heck a certain scene in After Story initiated a bout of depression the lasted for about three months.   She shows up in one of the earlier chapters of the manga so if it shows anything from the brother's work then we might.   FFXIV has a two week trial and it allows you to do most things up until level 20.   The one cool thing about this is that one character can be all of the classes and spec differently so you could, given enough time, get a number of classes up to level 20 including the crafting classes!   What server are you on? I'm about to resub and if you are Zalarea, I can introduce you to my old FC and add you to the LS that the FC and some others use that is pretty active.   Do you know when the OST will be out?   Also, I wish I knew what the opera-esque song in the beginning was.   The hard part about LovePlus is that it was never, officially, brought over to the US and it is put away as a niche within the niche of visual novels.   It is only available in English through a patch that someone put out years ago.   You may want to look at the visual novel community as a whole as it is starting to gain ground in the western markets.  Some examples:   * [The release of the first Grisaia game on Steam](http://store.steampowered.com/app/345610/)  * [The crowdfunding initiative to bring over Clannad in English.](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/sekaiproject/clannad-official-english-release/description)  * Popularity of indie game such as "Long Live the Queen" or the reception of the free visual novel, "Katawa Shoujo".   If you haven't seen it yet, I feel this way about Kekkai Sensen. I hadn't paid much attention to it, but I tried the first episode and then proceeded to binge watch what is out so far.   You had the wrong flair.  You had: Identification X  You need: Identification [Checkmark]  I have changed it accordingly, but please remember that when your identification request is fulfilled that you change it to the checkmark one.    I would say it is a reference. There were magazines with some characters from "Shuffle!" on it in the original series' first season, so it wouldn't be the first time that the Haruhi has brought in things from other anime.   Good luck, there are a number of choices in the first ten minutes or so.   You can fix that by using http://azure.kdays.cn/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/AlphaROMdiE-Build20140214.rar and dragging the sigilusengine.exe onto the open program. Then use the shortcut that the program creates to play it.   When you cook/heat alcoholic drinks, the alcohol burns off. This is why people don't have to be carded when buying beer battered onion rings or other things that have used alcohol to add flavor.    I don't know what to call this face but I absolutely love it.  It kinda reminds me of how the [Chitoge nendoroid](http://images.goodsmile.info/cgm/images/product/20140430/4410/28872/large/fbc4d3d6499715db6291711189f2337d.jpg) looks.   Whoever posted the album added the two images after I had posted my tl;dr. Odds are they did it to be funny as the story made it seem as though they let all of the deer go without harm.   I have no idea as I have yet to play them, I would just know because /r/visualnovels would have gone crazy over the announcement.   I hope that when/if Clannad sells well on Steam that key looks into having you guys bring over *Angel Beats ~1^st Beat~*.   It gets worse, they have been injecting their own websites as well. For the past few weeks, I have been redirected to "activate" my already working internet multiple times. They'll even go so far to replace portions of pages with the activation webpage that does nothing other than interrupt my browsing at random.  The internet is, and has been, paid for month after month with Comcast since 2004-ish when they bought out Alephia.    I had read the whole thing, but I summarized based upon what I could remember. There was a lot in there about the tendencies and bahaviors of wild animals and they would choose the lesser of two evils, to which they gave an example of how a seal jumped on a boat to avoid a whale.    Deer swam, went too far, got cold, went towards boat, guy on boat lassoed the deer, deer got on boat and brought back to shore.   Not that I know of. I think Mangagamer has only licensed the Higurashi series.  If you can find the games online the fan translation is, reportedly, good and the creator of the game approved of the group so much that he used their name in one of the later chapters of the Umineko series.   I would but two things:  1. I am double bass, if I was a first Tenor I could (maybe) pull it off, but my voice range is from G1 to (on a good day) a G4 while LISA's voice is much higher than that.  2. My Japanese is horrible     Yeah, I figured it would catch someone but I couldn't figure out a better way to word it but still have the title short enough to not be a full sentence.   It almost seems as though the vehicle had too much control and it didn't seem as floaty as Wipeout. (This is why wipeout had the airbreaks as they were used to finesse the vehicle to do tight turns at much faster speeds than normally possible.)   The hard part about recreating songs in minecraft is the combination of the fixed tempo (2.5, 5, or 10 ticks/s) and the really small scale that the noteblocks provide. It difficult to find something that sounds good within the confines of what the game provides.      For those of you interested in buying and playing the VN, it releases on the 15th on Steam!  EDIT: [Here is the link to the Steam page.](http://store.steampowered.com/app/310360/)   Gotta go fast    "It's Midori! (_)"  Fixed that for you.   Probably, but it kinda looks like an emoticon version of Sapphire.   Go post in /r/tsunderesharks, you will have a field day of karma.   Actually when it comes to standardization of weights everything is metric as a pound is described as a portion of a kilogram. (I don't remember the exact number off the top of my head)   But you did remember him, hence your post.   He did.   The August curse strikes again. Heck, Yoake Mae is completely translated and edited but the guy behind it has stalled it until he feels like completing it. :(   Top one as I would know what would happen as there is a [manga about this exact thing.](http://myanimelist.net/manga/16304/Gacha_Gacha_-_Secret)   [This one.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YKRnEOUxZm0)   It is a reference to a scene in Jurassic Park.   You may say that last part, but your story says otherwise. What you did was, basically, money laundering where in a criminal sends money around to put it "through the wash" so the dirty money isn't as "dirty".  Odds are you won't be able to rescind this and you may lose your account. (I think the only time Valve fixes this is when/if your account is hacked and then used for those purposes but this is not the case for you.)   The reason for this is that the camera's shutter is/was synced to the helicopter's blades rotating making it appear as though the blades are not moving as it is taking the frame at the same time every time.   Sorry, I just knew that it was legal to listen to a preview of a song on iTunes and I knew the anime OST was on there for people to buy so I linked to it.   I haven't been able to play the trial but odds are it is track #8 on the OST. (My Most Precious Treasure)   If you can, could you listen to the sample of the track on [iTunes](https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/tvanimeshon-angel-beats!-original/id842476044) to see if it is or not? (Otherwise I'll have to watch out for the OST from the game as I want it if that is the case)  ^ It is on the US iTunes.   It isn't the full episode. /r/anime has allowed people to share scenes in the comments and as links before without issue.    No reason to be sorry!    Auld Lang Syne.  When I went to Japan, pretty much every business, as it was closing, would play this over the speakers and it was a nice way of getting people to head out for the night.   I hate the bad rap those people have been giving Celiacs as they have an actual reason to be gluten-free.   You were using the wrong flair:   You had: [Identification X]  You needed: [Request]  You were asking for something similar to ____ therefore it is a request.   I have changed it accordingly, but please remember to flair correctly in the future.   **Issue:** Steam will constantly put current downloads into a queue rather than just downloading them.  I've never set up scheduling on Steam but every minute or so Steam will put a currently downloading game/update into a queue. It is getting to the point of being really really annoying.  Heck, within the time of typing this out I've had to restart the download for Tera three or four times. (I've lost count)   I don't think there is a translation of the **novel** it is based on. (Yet)  Invariably someone will do it as Hyouka has been translated that was also an actual novel.   Your description is wrong, they do not pay you for messaging your friends but for receiving ads. The advertisers, or those sending you unsolicited messages, have to pay "gems" which the user receives and they can then turn it into digital currency.   there doesn't seem to be  anything here   Have you read Ender's Game and subsequently Speaker for the Dead?    How about where the company allocates X% of the profits of the month from that game to modders and then the modders get a percentage of the allocated amount based on the number of views divided over the total views?  In short form:  ((Your mod's views)/(Total Mod Views))*(X% of profit or funds allocated to modders)       They are there to lessen the chance of bright flashes of light causing seizures in those watching it. The BD/DVD releases don't have to have this filter.   Sorry, it is a long title which would make it seem wordy. The full title is, MuvLuv Alternative: Total Eclipse.   I just figured that those who didn't recognize MLA would avoid clicking on it.   If you hug the walls you can make it to Mor Dhona around level 25.   It is often said, but the best soundtrack is one that you don't notice but gives weight and meaning beyond that of just the voices and sound effects. A great example of this would be Han Zimmer's work in the movie, *Interstellar*.   I was watching episode 7 of MuvLuv Alternative: Total Eclipse and in one of the latter scenes the Lieutenant has a bath robe on but it is being worn [*right over left*](https://i.imgur.com/fsOmr8j.jpg).  I didn't know, or pay attention to this, but in Japan all robes whether they are kimonos, yutakas, bath robes, etc are all supposed to be worn *left over right* as the reverse is only used in funerals. This is so ingrained in the culture that during my class trip last year to Japan during the initial orientation about the yutaka and such they specified strict adherence to this.  You'd think with her being a stickler, in the same episode, about being Japanese that she'd keep to the conventions over her own culture.  Does anyone have an explanation for this or was it just a minor detail that an animator got wrong and it failed to be corrected for the blurays?  	123
 All Assholes! All Assholes! Free Dogs! No Charge!   Get em riiiiight here! There's one for you sir, and one for you my good lady! And oh ho ho! We can't forget little Jimmie here who cries constantly now can we! Frat boys!   Shout out to all you big fat beautiful asses! Get Your free dogs here for a limited time!   Maybe a limited time!   Maybe...   Free Hot dogs right hereeeee!!!   Thank you, my friend.   Life has all kinds of surprises in store for us that we do not expect.   Sorry for cutting those onions.   Thank you, I truly appreciate it.   Yes, they have. They questioned all staff who worked at the school, and unfortunately they never saw or heard anything about Jon from my son. Hell, I even went as far as to talk personally with both Keith and Mark. They had no idea that my son was friends with a man named Jon. I tried to find as much info as I could, but the frustration came when I had literally nothing to go on as to find his whereabouts. But trust me when I say I will find the bastard. I don't think even God would forgive the things I would do to that man once I have my hands around his throat.       My friend, in this life we are given cards on the table that, at the time, can overwhelm us and even give us a true fear. Sometimes our guilt lingers beyond being able to comprehend what we have done or could have done. As with my son, I can tell by your comment that you loved your mother, and I have no doubt she loved you. Pressing on and doing our best to help others, including ourselves, is the best we can do in the end. I hope wherever your road leads you, it will lead you well. Not because you followed it, but because you chose too. I wish you luck my good friend. Never give in, and never give up.   Thank you, I worked hard to improve my structure and use words that are less used and feel fresh. Hope you have a great day today! :]  	8

 Dan  A Mexican standoff is 3+ people with guns pointed at each other.   That's a regular fucking standoff  I trusted you, Dan. You let me down.    One of the more "What the fuck, Japan?" things I've seen today.    Southern U.S.   God, I feel like you're just gonna lynch me whenever you open your fucking inbred mouth. And I'm white.    Don't say that word. Don't say that word. Don't say that word.    Or the one where some guy played DOOM with a set of toasters.    And covered by flash.    In that case, what order should I watch them in? "Armageddon" doesn't make it sound like the first.   Well. Time to go watch that. Can I start with this or one of the other Getter Robo-es?    As long as your phone is above 20% when you screenshot, I don't care what you're using.    WHY does Nintendo not want me to have Rosalina?   YOU MOTHER FUCKER   Really, was there ever any doubt that Anno despises his fans?   Probably closer to 3 years old, considering they're almost definitely using the Skyrim engine.    Comin' again to save the motherfuckin' day yeah   I saw a couple at my local Toys R Us in NJ.    "Come with me if you want to get in the fucking robot"   The world needs more mecha cosplays. Especially if they're this tier. I mean god damn this is nice.    "WE'VE GOT SPLATOON MOTHERFUCKERS! SUCK OUR DICK!"   I love Gunbuster, but I don't want to spend like $200 on one.    Megazord, Gurren Lagann, Eva Unit-01, Big O(?), Megas XLR, no idea, Gunbuster, no idea. Guess I gotta go watch more super robot shows.    I had never even considered that, but it actually makes *more* sense that SEELE put the mask on Lilith rather than the other way around. She does drop it the moment she regains her soul. And she has a different mask in Rebuild.    The only source on that article is a couple Xbox One users. Take that for what you will.    BAN MARJORAM'S MASK!   What the fuck am I looking at?    Someone shoot me.    Not enough geometry 0/10  Really though, that is a great cosplay.    I'm going away for a few weeks this summer and I want to play some Smash while I'm gone. Thing is, I don't want to lug around a monitor. Can I use an iPad (or Hell, even my phone) as a display?   Clock Blocked   Are you Santa? Is this the unicorn I wanted when I was six?

Shinji: Eevee. Ability: Run Away.    After episode 26, watch the director's cuts of episodes 21-24. They fill in a lot of the stuff that was in Death and Rebirth but not the original and is more or less essential to EoE. And going to EoE straight from episode 26 will leave you very disoriented from a timeline perspective.    They tried to make him more "kewl". I think that was around the time everyone involved in the good Sonic games either had a collective aneurysm or left. Or both.    Do people on this sub not understand the concept of satire?   I think I might actually use this.    I've been meaning to watch this show, but I still have one question:  Is it about incest? Because I want to watch a brother and sister bonding, not brother and sister bondage.    But that wasn't *really* Mami, right? The only magical girls who are actually in Rebellion are Godoka, Sayaka, and Homura. And Charlotte.    I never noticed his profanity until it was gone. It just weaves so naturally into his dialogue.    Thor's in his Asgard, all's right with the world.       I haven't seen Kung Fury yet and it looks like all of you have lost your fucking minds.    BROJOB! BROJOB!   Rebellion all took place in Homura's labyrinth, didn't it? So unless one of them went witch during the fight (as evidenced by the Walpurgisnacht battle, this isn't probable) Rebellion wouldn't really do much. At least, not for Homura. And I did specify no Godoka.     The MP-Eva's had their own cores. Plus, they weren't starting 3I by themselves, they used the ascended Unit-01 as a conductor for their own Anti-AT fields. And the Lance's. And Giant Naked Rei's.    I made sure it wasn't unit-01 almost entirely for that purpose. Unit-02 (as a child of Adam) doesn't have the same impact potential as Unit-01. So no divine ascension here.    Mami, Sayaka, Madoka (not Godoka), Homura, and Kyoko fight against a standard Evangelion (to be specific, use the production model Unit-02). The battle takes place in the Tokyo-3. Unit-02 gets the progressive knife and nothing else.   (Homura doesn't get to rewind time for a win.)   I can't tell what level of irony this is working on. It's like a Lovecraftian abomination of a meme.    this generation ruined '90s kids. I want '00s '90s kids.    In regards to the goat thing, that is the proper word. And it actually was a young goat [first](http://english.stackexchange.com/questions/32732/when-did-kid-start-to-mean-child), though this person is still performing mental gymnastics that could easily win a gold medal at the oppression olympics.    "I'm just trying to make sure that I can blame patriarchy for everything, even if it makes no god damn sense. **THEY'RE** the crazy ones, not me!"   Buzzfeed isn't exactly in a position to criticize someone else's journalism.    That's Colonel Sanders, obviously.    Private cash money is robbery.    My first words were the script to Army of Darkness.    I live in Jersey, and I was a victim of Sandy.

Off the top of my head, he took a dig at anime protagonists when he mentioned one tossing off to unconscious women in his C/Katherine review, and he portrayed our very own waifu wars in his ET for Atari 2600 review.    They feel all other wounds like they would if they were actually happening (even sustaining the same injuries as the Eva if their synch ratio is high enough). So Asuka and Rei will feel the same, no questions asked. But the Eva has no balls, partly because they're angels and partly because they're moms. So it's more likely that Shinji, Kaworu, and Toji would feel the same as they would if they didn't have male genitals. Just sorta... under their dicks.    It's like Sonic the Hedgehog, but for grandmas instead of autistic teenagers.    He'd tear them right back out again.   (Really though, [I don't think he'd be too broken up about it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xew8SXUMxsE))   I had been planning on buying an i5 for my new build, but now I'm gonna start looking at the AMD alternatives.    [Anime spoilers](/s "It's because of the Life Fibers. It's our clue that she isn't actually completely human")   [TTGL spoiler](/s "Isn't it because she was the Antispiral's messenger? And therefore not completely human?")   Holy shit, this is exactly what I need.    To be fair, if we did bring him back we probably could fix that. Cochlear implants and all that.    Attack on Titan is the same deal. Pretty much 100% Germany.    It's like Venom learned from Bardiel.       The entirety of Cut, Paste, and Kill is great. My favorite is Powerkranz   Japanese reads right to left, so most of their books are written accordingly. When localized, most translators choose to keep this to avoid screwing up the art. This ain't always the case, but it usually is.    This might be true for Red and Leaf, maybe even Gold and Crystal, but once legendaries and gods and all that get thrown into the plot, the whole theory goes right down the drain. Specifically, Arceus in Gen IV, Xerneas in Gen VI, and the whole plot of Gen V. The fact that God himself appears before you and deems you worthy of capturing him would imply that Lucas and Dawn are in fact humans of His design, not an android created by someone else. Because if he were to appear before the worthiest trainer, wouldn't it be the guy who designed your AI?  I think the theory that Pokemon's humans are actually Pokemon (and not humans as we know them) is still the strongest. It has the most supported evidence, and explains everything that would be explained by this theory. In the games, we see that Pokemon don't need to eat or sleep a long as they aren't damaged. Since the trainer never takes any damage, they can just keep going forever.    I would recommend the original 21-24, followed by episodes 25/26. The Director's cuts seem to be more of a setup to End of Evangelion than the originals, which led more so into the original ending. They really only have some extra scenes (and one infamous scene from episode 24 cut shorter). If nothing else, it's easier to appreciate the director's cuts after having seen the original episodes. Also, the director's cuts lead directly into the film, as even the preview for episode 24' shows one of the scenes from the film. Going straight to EoE from episode 26 will leave you disoriented from a timeline standpoint.    Komm, Susser Tod (Tumbling Down) would be a good choice as well, except for the fact that it's pretty long. Fly Me to the Moon is shorter, as well as having less of the weeb factor.    That was pretty fun.  The next one should be Fly Me To the Moon, I kick ass at that song.    I ended up getting a Nidoran F on Route 35 and double kicked my way through the gym.    The movie in question is called Death and Rebirth. It's technically in two parts. Death is just a 40 minute recap episode, and Rebirth is the first quarter-ish of End of Evangelion. So if you just watched the series, move on to End of Evangelion.   Though you should remember to watch episodes 21-24 Director's Cut after episodes 1-26. Then EoE. I haven't seen anyone mention that.    [proof](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_Lou6W9G5dnU/TFetpEDsklI/AAAAAAAAAQ0/hl22FtxOwQc/s320/mari.png)   I believe it has a built in _ macro.    Yeah. The worst part is that I made it through the gym without a single death, so I foolishly believed I could survive *this* battle too.   I think they call that hubris.   This baka fucking gaijin probably hasn't even seen Cory in the House.       I would debate hunger actually. In every PMD game I only ever found it annoying, and I was actually pretty glad to see it gone.    I think it goes without saying that *Fathoms* is better than G98   It looks decent enough. Is it worth spending the money for a paperback copy?   The latter. Sonic and autistic fanart go together like 3D sonic games and shitty quality assurance.    "Destroy All Monsters 2: This time, we mean **ALL** monsters"   Aim for the Heavens! Neon Genesis Toppa Mobile Suit Gundambuster!   (I threw in some Gunbuster, the only significant mecha you were missing)   What is this, Shadow the Hedgehog?   Victim = suffering from something undeserved + a lack of bias from me specifically.    They should go for the next level of inclusivity, like having ~~colored-only~~ poc-only areas like water fountains.    I don't even want to make fun of the guy. This pic is adorable.    But Tumblr still isn't a cult.    Bye.    The Republicans are the right-wingers who want the government to have less power, with more individual freedom. The Democrats are the other end of the spectrum, more government support, though there aren't as many individual freedoms.   It's a bit more complex than that, but that's the best I can describe it at midnight on an anime forum.    Is this available in a higher quality?   You're right, I'm not entitled to free content. It sure is a good thing I paid for the whole game.    Mewtwo.    Arceus is also the only mentioned deity in Smash.    Just look at Yoko and her Tengen Toppa Titty Tank.    implying HOA isn't going to side with the Governator.   The first two (the good ones) had Sarah Connor. She was actually killed offscreen between 2 and 3.    Mickey is Glocal?!   No, Unit-01's in the engine.    History remembers him as a coward Mickey!   Opinions are like assholes: you are one! And they stink and so do you!   I thought he didn't need to eat, though. At least, under Earth's yellow Sun.    I mean, they survive on sunlight. That's gotta be photosynthesis, right?    Therapy with Shinji.    Incredibly undank.    Welp. I'll never catch a Mr. Mime again.    As a Rosalina main, [:)](http://imgur.com/EeEpYyd)   Teaching cursive is fucking useless.

He tries to time it just right so he can get off the subway right as the door closes.    I really, *really* need that to have a Western release. If it does I think I'll have enough Evangelion content to justify giving it its own shelf.    The 3-in-1 packs aren't hard to find, I got mine at Barnes and Noble. Volumes 13 and 14 are only standalone so far. If you look on eBay, you can find some stuff relatively cheap.    You think the darkness is your ally?   It helps if the girl in question happens to be genetically similar to Yui Ikari.    My guess is an abnormally large varia/gravity suit. With an optional baby metroid helmet.    http://imgur.com/5yw9DHO   I'm beefing over pie.    "You're adopted?"   It's not easy being meguca   Has MadoSaya gone too far?   I've been hoping. My thought is that they should release volumes 12-14 as an "End of Evangelion" compilation, even though 12 is already in the gray one.    No, all 12 men on the Moon to date have been American.    My favorites are actually a tie between Unit-01 and the Mass Production Units  Unit 01 just has an amazing design. I also love how badass she is when Shinji isn't in charge.   The MP-Evas are really unnerving (or unNERVing i guess) since they look so... biological in their movements, despite the fact that they still give off the outward appearance of the robots. The other Evas don't do that. That and they have fuckin' sword-lances.    The DVDs, the Manga, and one soundtrack CD (Death)  I haven't seen any chance to grab any of the art books yet. Yet.       Weird. I haven't seen many go for that cheap.    [wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byronic_hero)  Taking into account the character development we'd seen throughout the first series, and even some of the second and Final Wars, I thought Goji has all the traits required of a Byronic Hero. My English teacher disagrees and I disagree back. What do you guys think?   There was a period with collegehumor where they did censor some swear words, and judging from the TruTV shows I've seen they're going to be around that level of vulgarity. So I'm not really worried.   platinum thin is probably the best release (so far) of NGE, and EoE really hasn't had any great releases yet. The US copies of EoE are $100+, so unless you want to spend that much you should buy one from the UK, where the movie is really cheap for some reason.    This isn't cringe. This is good.    It honestly makes as much sense to me to ship her with Sub-Zero if we just stick her with any fool with ice powers. Jack and Elsa just don't seem like a good match.   ninja edit: I just found [this](http://uekiodiny.deviantart.com/art/Sub-Zero-Elsa-and-Jack-ah-O-O-454801167) after a quick bit of googling. *it's perfect*   1) the first two angels had been around for a couple billion years, as they were the Seeds of Life that originally crashed to Earth. Second Impact took place in 2000, and scattered young, larval Angels all across the world to ultimately find their way to Tokyo-3.   2) That's where they thought Adam, their father, was. They wanted to get back to him to be the vessel of the Third Impact. It was actually Lilith, they just figured that there couldn't be another AT Field as strong as their Seed of Life.   3) they had different motives and scenarios for third impact. Gendo wanted to use it to see Yui again, while SEELE wanted to create a God out of humanity.   4) Actually Adam (Unit-01 being the exception), but other than that you're spot-on.   5) S2 engine. It's an organ that allows Angels to be perfect, self-sufficient, godlike life forms. It allows for them to pull from limitless power by harnessing the AT Field. This is why the Angels are just about immortal except for the core, which is the S2 engine.   6) To make a very long story short, the Lance was packaged with both seeds of life. It was basically an emergency shutdown device for seeds of life so two didn't end up on the same planet. The Lance we see in the series was Adam's, which he used on himself during the First Impact after Lilith lost hers.   7) She's a clone of Shinji's mother, Yui, with added Lilith DNA (I think). She also houses the soul of Lilith (except Rei II, who holds only a part, the other belonging to Unit-00)   aww...   but Sexism= prejudice + not being me so WZXMXN CANT BE SEXIST!!!   Police should all have to show if they have bad taste in anime   It doesn't look like it's the title of the promotion, since it's only on the Evangelion side of the "Schick X Evangelion" thing, so is it the new subtitle for 3.0+1.0? Or is it the retroactive subtitle to Neon Genesis thanks to the new BD/DVD?    Why include Portal in a Playstation commercial when that game is known for its PC version?   I hope she's okay with Mothra being the #1 mom.     From what I understand of your question, you *have* seen the series and want to buy it, correct? If not, all of these are in the order you should watch them (except Death and Rebirth, it's a glorified recap episode)  There's nowhere to legally digitally download any of the series to my knowledge, so I'll break down the releases by series:  NEON GENESIS EVANGELION:  There's been a couple releases on VHS, Laserdisc, and DVD. There's also an upcoming new DVD release and a Blu-Ray release which may or may not be coming to the West. The cheapest DVD box currently is ADV's "thin pack" Platinum Collection (you can find it on Amazon, but beware as there is a lot of bootlegging). This contains the whole series, plus the Director's Cut Episodes, in the highest available quality (until Blu Ray HD). It's the one I have. There's also another Platinum Collection, the "thick pack". Same contents, episodes 1-26/24'. But this one has many more bonus features, though the overall quality sufferers for it.   TL;DR: If you want cheap(ish) but good image quality, Thin Platinum. If you can spend more and don't mind slightly lower image quality of it means more content, then the Thick Platinum. If you want both and want to try your luck, you can wait for the New DVD or Blu-Ray.   DEATH AND REBIRTH  Don't even bother. It's getting included with End of Evangelion anyway.   END OF EVANGELION  This had a couple DVD releases from Manga Entertainment and another company who I don't remember. It's expensive as FUCK for a U.S. copy of the DVD ($100+, MIN). If you have a multi-region DVD player (or a PC), just import an English copy from the UK. For whatever reason it's really cheap across the pond. This is also getting re-released on Blu-Ray, though no confirmation of a new DVD has come up. This brings us back to D+R. The Blu-Ray of NGE includes "Revival of Evangelion", which is the final cut of Death (the recap half of Death and Rebirth) cut together with the final cut of End of Evangelion.   TL;DR: **GOD SAVE THE QUEEN**  Evangelion 1.11: You Are (Not) Alone  This one's been pretty easy to find, but there *is* some fuckery afoot. There also exists a release on DVD and Blu-Ray of Evangelion 1.01, which is just a non-remastered version of the same movie that came out, then they realized there was some work that needed to be done, hence 1.11. (1.0 is the theatrical version). In my experience, buying 1.11 is cheaper, plus it includes the old version in case you're a masochist.   TL;DR make sure there's no zeroes  Evangelion 2.22: You Can (Not) Advance  This time there wasn't even a 2.02 release. Choose DVD or Blu Ray and give Anno your cash.   Evangelion 3.33: You Can (Not) Redo  This one isn't out in the West yet. If you hate dubs with a passion, then you can import a DVD or Blu Ray from Japan, but if you want a dubbed release from Funimation we're still waiting on that shit.   Sadamoto's manga  The official manga has four 3-volumes-in-one releases, plus standalone releases for volumes 13/14. Check Barnes and Noble, they should have something.    I have seen Hellsing Abridged and it didn't even occur to me that that was a reference.   I'm with you, DJ Hero was the shit. Especially since I got the thing where you could play as Daft Punk. But that's a fair point as well.    That might be the single most incorrect thing I've heard all week. It's so far from anything resembling the truth. She was an advocate for women's rights long before taking the bullet. The bullet is just what put her on the global map, especially since she kept doing what she was doing after getting shot for it.    2015  going to /r/AdviceAnimals for dank memes  fucking casual. true losers only go to /r/4ChanMeta for the freshest of maymays   It's a joke, though it looks like the original was unironic defening.    Allow me to play Devil's Advocate, as someone who watch intently the brutal death of the music game genre.   ~~It was a few years before the end of the last console generation. There was exactly one game that most people point to when they talk about the downfall of music games: DJ Hero. It was similar enough in concept to Guitar Hero, everyone was pretty excited for some fan-favorite techno influenced songs. But the controller... The controller is one of the most fucked up abominations to come out after the Power Glove. Even the Kinect laughs at the DJ Hero controller. This ruined the game, and made everyone realize what they were doing wasn't fun, it was just a glorified quicktime event-filled music player. This is when the entire market realized that music games really did make them look like tremendous twats who could just as easily be streaming the same songs on the internet for free. It was with that game that the genre died down to a couple releases a year, after both Rock Band and Guitar Hero kind of gave up.~~  So the defener could be interpreting an electronic-influenced song as harkening back to the death of the genre, the worst thing one can do when trying to revive the genre.   Or he could just be a pretentious asshole, either one really.   Edit: there's also the possibility that I'm a fuckin idiot who doesn't know what he's talking about.   HE SAID **WILL** YOU   DE**FEAT** THEM   YOUR **DE**MONS   AND ALL THE NONBELIEVERS   And the scale (albeit, the archaic version of the scale with the two plate things) is a symbol of justice.    Groovy.    So is You Can (Always) Be Free the official title for Evangelion 3.0+1.0? Because that looks like it's attributed to the Evangelion half of the logo, not being the title for the promotion.    I'll post a comment from the old thread so more people can see it:  [Here's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hhZX9uIDZaE) a video if you need some help singing in time  I realize I'm pretty late to this party   Biollante is his daughter! that sick fuck!

 Start with the name,  "Jamb"=jambon or ham, sausage, tasso but can be chicken, seafood etc.; "ala"= a la, with or everything; "Ya"=African for rice.   Start with the holy trinity, add seasonings, protein of choice, rice, then tomatoes and stock. Cook until rice is al dente.  The dish is usually heavily seasoned depending on the protein.  It should be somewhat "wet" like a rice casserole so that it sticks together instead of "dry" like a rice pilaf.          While there's no hard and fast rule, Jambalayas usually have tomatoes, tomato sauce or both.  With the addition of black-eyed peas your dish looks more like a dressed up version of Hopping John's.  Not that that's a bad thing but it's not what I consider cajun Jambalaya to be.  Note: Spent 10 years cooking in New Orleans.

This is why I never put mozz in my mac and cheese.  On another note,  "free range chicken broth"?  Made me imagine bowls of chicken broth hopping around a soup coup.   I went to a grocery store in San Diego to purchase a money order.  When I got home I realized I had $100 too much and the clerk must have messed up the transaction so my husband and I went back and told the clerk.  He called his supervisor and they counted down the register but no discrepancies showed up.  We went on to shop in the store and as we were about to check out the clerk ran up to us and said they finally found the discrepancy and his manager had offered us 2 free deli sandwiches for the $$$.  I could have messed with this young man but I gave him the $100.00 back knowing that if I made a mistake like that it would have been a god-send for a customer to return a $100.00 mistake except that it wasn't a god-send since I'm an Atheist and have empathy for someone in that position.    Okay, this one I did all by myself.  At my first duty station I made some pie dough using the Armed Forces Recipe Cards.  It listed every ingredient on the front except for water.  I made what I thought looked like a perfect pie dough for 300 portions of Cobbler.  Refrigerated it before rolling it out, it then rolled out beautifully with no cracks and baked off to a perfect golden brown.  I didn't discover how important a little bit of water was until they tried to cut up the pie and the crust instantly turned to dust!     Oh please elaborate!   On a destroyer I was stationed on we had 4 five gallon buckets of used fryer oil stored on the deck in the galley that was all of about 150 sq ft.  We were expecting high-speed maneuvers that day and secured everything we possibly could however, no one thought to check that the lids were tight and the buckets could not move around.  All four buckets spilled at the same time.  Since this was a ship we first had to stop as much of the oil from going down the drain and scoop up as much oil as possible all the while the ship was still in maneuvers, left then right at angles of about 30 degrees.  This happened right after securing for lunch.  Took about four hours to finally clean up the mess and we still managed to prepare dinner in time.  Everyones fault because no one checked.  Wish someone had been able to make a video!      https://youtu.be/mzveUz-WRGQ   Yes, it was a version that a young couple brought to Austin in 1972 to people that never heard of a muffuletta.  The big difference is the bread and olive tapenade.   I worked at a Schlotsky's in Jr High School in 1981 when it was all about the sandwich.  The bread was delivered in the mornings fully baked so the recipe was kept secret.   Schlotsky's bread is what sets it apart from a Muff. and I should know since I lived there for nine years.  Muffs use a round Italian.  Schlotz uses a recipe that combines a Sourdough starter with a  English muffin type bread and they are very protective of the recipe!   Seriously, don't repost from Yahoo food ever again.   A thing of gastronemic beauty created you have.   Just puttin' it out there.  A lot of people are put off when they find out their sushi chef is Mexican/Latino.  They think it's because they'll work for less $$$ but they're wrong.  Gotta support my peeps!      Reminds me too much of my food and wine pairing class, sans the wine.   This has to be in Texas!    There's a historical explanation for this.  The Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 effectively stopped all immigration from China to the US and many Chinese who were already here were not allowed to return if they left the US who still had family here.    This caused many Chinese to immigrate to Mexico where many opened restaurants or became street vendors.  In the meantime, the Chinese practically invented human smuggling to the US.    Consequently the Mexicans, particularly along the border have developed a particularly refined palate for Chinese/Asian food.  Most of the best Chinese/Japanese restaurants in Texas employ a Chef Martinez or Chef Rodriquez as head chef.     If you've been scarred by this thread then you are what we'd call a pansy, pussy,    Her nails,  I have felt your pain!  What gyno  patient wants to have a pelvic exam with a doctor that has 1 inch nails.     You can plan but sometimes things come up that you have absolutely no control over.  For instance a piss test in the military while you're heavily menstruating.  You can't say no and you have to pee into a cup and if you use a pad instead of tampons then you try to pee without any blood getting into the sample because you have to hold your sample over your shoulder in front of every other person until you submit it.       Not being taken seriously by doctors who will tell you your problem is "all in your head".   The credibility and sanction of Catholicism and the Pope and the special status that no other religion is privileged to under the UN,  despite the fact that B. Mussolini granted the Vatican it's special status.   If he cut out the unnecessary theatrics he'd be a lot quicker but then that is what the customers want.   I say this to my cat over and over when he purposely walks in front of me to slow me down and give him what he wants!    you're at the grocery store and the butcher asks how many crabs you need and you respond, "6 all day".      I've never understood a snood or paper hats for that matter.  Facial and body hair, be it from a beard (long or short), neck, eyebrows, eyelashes or the forearms all shed at the same rate.  To be completely safe from hair you'd have to wear a net completely over the head and gloves up to the elbows!   Try putting the oatmeal (steal cut) plus all other ingredients and seasonings you want in a crock pot overnight on low.  You'll wake up to a lovely aroma and a sweet treat!    I like the concept.  Think I'll try one with crab, bacon and avocado with a shmear of mayo on homemade bread.   This looks great but crosses the bounds into the realm of casserole instead of mac   cheese.      No, it's Rudy's.  I plan to get to Heim's as early as possible.  Can't wait to try their pork belly burnt ends!    I would almost commit a crime to get a meal of "free" prison food that looked like that!   You can also just use a thick-cut raw onion ring or bell pepper.   I concur.  Also the perfect ratio of mush and herb to pastry.  Well done my friend!   All of the people in this picture appear to be happy.  "nough said".  What is interesting is which ones are deemed, "gross, disgusting or doable" in the comments.  The old skinny lady, the overweight younger lady or the overweight middle-aged man.  Keep the comments coming as this will make a great essay after I pull the data!       I bought it from a local baker.  Here's his facebook page. https://www.facebook.com/pages/Le-Boulanger-Barbu/1521184454811755?fref=photo      Here's my version. http://imgur.com/QZHQGQB    Thankfully this didn't happen on the actual bridge of the Huey P Long.  It's one scarry frickin' bridge.  Two narrow lanes of traffic on each side with an elevated train trussel between them. https://youtu.be/IrhTAirKkWQ https://youtu.be/ihjcs4srka0    Dr Higgins lived there and taught Eliza Dolittle ow to talk.    She should have saluted.  Nuff said.   Billy Graham no more represents the American mainstream than Hee Haw.       Is their faith so weak that they feel that a government must prop it up?  What denomination will this theocracy adhere to?    The middle east has fought between two major factions of Islam for 1400 years so that one can rule.  I can't imagine how the US could pick and stick with one denomination.      No because Jesus!   It doesn't work for every pest but it did make a difference in my garden last year from the one before.   Plant Marigolds at various intervals in your garden.  They emit a natural repellant for a variety of bugs.   This may explain why so many Chinese/Japanese restaurants have Latino chefs here in Texas.   k   What if the man said "Asians can't cook".  If you were of Oriental descent wouldn't you be pissed?  I see no difference between a judgement made about genitals or physical characteristics (race is an illusion in and of itself unless your a victim of it).     You'll do fine.  Stay grounded in reality but keep your aspirations in the sky!   I did my Externship with what I thought was a place that could teach me the in's and out's of running a restaurant.  Turns out they rely on accountants even though the so-called owner has a business degree from TCU.  He never gave any direct instruction.  He's basically a political drone in training    3 extra plates = a 50 cent per extra plate charge.   When guys say that what they really mean is they believe women can't handle the pressure of being a professional in the industry.    To them their mother probably made the best whatever.  With a few exceptions, no one could make it like she could.  Mom was always depicted at being able to cook the perfect Thanksgiving turkey with all the sides plus desserts for 20 family members and look good while doing it in heals! Plus FOH duties which included the table settings and seasonal decor.  Women were perfectly suited to cook in the home for family and manage organizational stress but never in the Big Ole' Capitalist Marketplace.  We're just delicate flowers that need squashi....'er protection.  News Flash...--.--..Women are as capable as men in working under pressure either in Food Service or as US Navy Combat fighters.   It's a perception thing that screws women out of a fair wage.  Women can be wonderful cooks and great organizers but not when it comes to being a professional because only men are perceived that can do that.   Hope she turned out okay.  Sad what you have to do when you're desperate.   Soooo did you?   LOL!  "Croque Messier"  I thought the only way you could make a Croque Monsieur more messy was to add an egg.   Hey now!  As a Scot-Irish that loves to drink but doesn't want to pay for it I proudly resemble that remark!   Reminds me of Sheldon asking Penny (Big Bang) how they make a half sandwich.   "Where exactly does the half come from? Are you giving me half of someone elses sandwich, or do I have to wait for someone else to order the other half?..........You can't make a half of a sandwich, a half of a whole sandwich is just a small sandwich!" giggle;)   Banana for scale please.   I could buy 4 McDoubles a day for a week which = $4.76x7=$22.67.  Plus a bag of 5 lb potatoes at .69 per lb = $3.45 and vegetable oil for frying.  Cumulative total = $26.12.   Most poor people live in areas that have no accessible to grocers that have fresh fruits and vegetables.  I want to give them  access.  I'm serious!  A Fresh Food Truck!         Well done!  I wanted to ask for some of my money back in tuition when my chef/instructor admonished me in front of a guest that a small tasting plate I presented as a Croque Monsieur with a wine pairing was actually a Croque Madame (because it was smaller) even though there was no fried/poached egg!  Now you need to make a Hot Kentucky Brown!   You must really like tater salad to show it front and center in this pic!  Where is this from?    I know, right?  Dad used to like his Scotch on the rocks but whiskey has to be neat.         Use Sevin dust.   NM=Needless Markup   It's navy wide jargon.  Many kitchens use the term also.   OMG, Billy Joel!  You're killing me!   My mother's divorce from her second husband.  All of a sudden it was Mom, myself and my little brother.  I was 12 and I became  responsible for my 9 year old brother after school.  I also had do start dinner and do the laundry and whatever cleaning needed to be done before my Mom came home or else we were berated or worse, simply ignored.      Exactly,  If Jesus was God then he can't be killed.  Only changed back into his original form which was not a sacrifice for God and himself.  Considering the amount of suffering and death of ordinary humans, Jesus ranks really low.   While I like the passage you refer to it does not reflect a true sacrifice.  Much like the Peter Pan story, everyone must give up their childhood in order to become an adult.  What Jesus was saying here was not to love your earthly existence but to instead look forward to an everlasting life with God.  If that is the case then there was no sacrifice since the inevitable outcome was to become something greater.  A true sacrifice means a loss without compensation and that never happened with the Crucifixion of Jesus.    I was an Admiral's cook at a Flag Mess.  Worked many parties at his quarters.  When the parties started to wind down his wife, who herself held a high level civilian position in DC,  would come back into the kitchen, tell me to grab a "drink" and we would go out back to talk, smoke and commiserate.  She hated most of the O wives.  Most down to earth woman I've ever met.     Mmmmm, fat charred with mustard!    I don't know if I would call his style endearing but Stephen Jay Gould wrote many essays and books that touched on complex topics but wrote in such a way that the everyday person could understand.   His style and even title's were enough to to draw you in.  See "Male nipples and clitorial ripples".   https://youtu.be/F5JIpT4GkyM       Cabbage wedges, carrots and Dutch baby yellow potatoes were oven roasted with a mixture of 6 Tbls butter, 1 cup minced scallions, 2/3 cup creamed horseradish, salt and pepper.    Corned beef cooked as usual with spice packet+2 tsp black peppercorns and 6 whole clove.    Glazed with Jezebel Sauce:  1 cup orange marmalade, 2/3 cup apple jelly, 1/4 cup creamed horseradish, 5 Tbls Creole mustard and 1 tsp course ground black pepper.  Makes about 2 cups.  Leftover sauce is great with pork chops or ham or spooned over slightly melted cream cheese as a dip.           I used to clean out clogged drains with baking soda and vinegar.  Pretty much worked like a charm.          This would not go well with a beer.   Whataburger, Braums, and Jack-in-the-Box.    I guess reposting stuff that others posted from Pinckerest makes the front page.  Shame on you OP!   Unless you're actually eating them in Texas because that makes them better ; )   Maybe you ate it and don't remember lol!   	111
 That would be true if it weren't for the Bible...  Acts 16:30-31 - He then brought them out and asked, Sirs, what must I do to be saved? They replied, Believe in the Lord Jesus, and you will be saved."  John 3:3 - Jesus replied, Very truly I tell you, no one can see the kingdom of God unless they are born again.   I second this question. I think that I would really enjoy co-op missions, but I've never been able to play one.   I haven't gotten Uplay to work without crashing on my PC.

 Yes because every black male is approached like that by the police..gtfoh   And I am no psychologist, but I did stay at a Holiday Inn last night   It's not that they don't fight back.. Most of these videos are propaganda videos to help support their specific faction, so having a video of someone struggling and fighting back doesn't really give the whole "we submit" kind of feel that these videos tend to have..   Thank you so much for answering my questions. I am going on as a sound tech.   My one question to you is, did you enjoy your experience working for RC as a sound tech?   Amen   All I could really think about was that I didn't want to die on the floor and that it was cold down there. I didn't want to die in the cold   Thanks will do   Half pound for $450... I live in northern Cali and have never heard of a deal like that..   When you think about things like this happening to you, you always think you would save the day and knock the gun out of his hands, blah blah blah. Bt that shit went out the window real quick and I just stayed on the ground hoping it would be over quickly    I am leaving on a 6mo contract next month with Royal Caribbean as an audio tech/stage hand and I still have some questions but the company is being quite vague with me. Here are some questions I have and feel free to let me know how your overall experience was as well! Thanks! My 5 Questions:  I am a drummer and would not enjoy not being able to play for 6mo. Is there a staff lounge with say a piano and drum kit you can play?  How easy is it really to change rooms if you don't get along with your roommate?  How are the hours of work? I have heard many different things, anywhere from 12+hrs all week to some days are 12hr days and some are 2hr days.  Can you fast track yourself to a higher up position during your first contract? Can you do it at all?  Are you allowed off the ship when in port if there is no work to be had?  Thanks everyone! I look forward to some responses! It will help me out greatly :)     I am leaving on a 6mo contract next month with Royal Caribbean as an audio tech/stage hand and I still have some questions but the company is being quite vague with me.

It will help me out greatly :)   Exactly man   It's hard for me to call it a good thing. Would I have rather it didn't happen, yes. But am I glad now that it did.. It's hard to say.. I'm justthankful I was able to take something positive away from such a shitty experience... And didn't get shot   He got away with around $450 so I'll let you make that call   No they have not yet, no real leads I know of either   I honestly don't know if me having a gun would have made the situation better or worse. Trying to go for a gun when one is already drawn on you, unless you're a quick draw, I feel like it would do more harm than good.  I do not own a gun, have never fired a gun nor do I plan to purchase one for my own safety.. I don't feel like I live in an unsafe area even tho this happened to me. The police said it was the first armed robbery in over 10yrs to happen in the town so a freak incident. Altho I have been toying around with the idea of hunting for the last year or so..  After the robbery I was very hesitant to go back to work and my bosses actually wanted me to close the bar the very next day and I literally had to plea with then to give me the night off and they reluctantly did because I think they knew I would have just quit. I was able to talk to a counselor and therapist a couple times that the victims unit of my police department provided. I was having a hard time wrapping my head around the whole ordeal and why it had to happen to me and to a degree still am but I have kind of come to grips with the fact that it was a sign to start making moves in my life and have started to do just that. And yes, I still close the bar at night but am much more cautious and nervous when doing so, but I put my two weeks in tonight so not too much longer    My life did not flash before my eyes, however I truly think it happened for a reason because I am not doing what I am suppose to be doing with my life. So I actually got a new and much better job that I could consider a career and put my two weeks in tonight. So it definitely gave me a life kick in the ass.    He had hosiery or tights over his face so I could not really see his face bt I saw what he was wearing and could recognize the voice again if I ever heard it.. Something I doubt I will ever forget   Fuck man, ya sweet vengeance would be very very nice.. After our robbery there was a robbery in a near by city and then another in south Lake Tahoe, all robbed in a similar way as we were. I am really hoping the police can find him with the evidence they collected at the other robberies and then maybe get the chance to see him in court and help put him away..  That's really what I want    I cant say having a firearm on me would have made the situation any better but I don't know if it would have made it worse either. Can't say I feel like a victim for not having a firearm tho. But I do understand why you would say that.     I was about 90% sure I was going to die that night. He could have done it so easily and my co worker didn't give him all the money (although the robber didn't know that) bt if he did that would have been all the reason he needed to do me in. When I think back about it, there are so many things I wish I would have done, but in the moment there was no chance I would have actually done it. But it is interesting to look at the situation from a few different ways in my head. I will have to check out that book tho, sounds interesting to me, especially now    My coworker only gave him the money out of 1 of the 2 draws we have and he didn't get our deposit for the night so only about $450   No fear boner, would have hurt anyway bc I was face down on a tile floor haha.. I have never shot a gun and have mixed feeling on carrying a concealed weapon.. I am not some hippy liberal guy that thinks we should all hold hands bt at the same time I don't know if having a gun on me would have made the situation better or worse..bt having an open carry might have meant that he would have seen my gun and maybe not done what he did, but who knows    Thank you, and it was actually kind of hard to bring myself to go back.. I am not the kind of person who has things really bother me after the fact, bt this shook me up and I didn't really want to go back to work right away. My bosses actually wanted me to close the next night which floored me and I literally had to plea with them to let me take the night off. Reluctantly they gave me the night off but it was like twisting their arm which kind of soured me on the establishment even more. I will say I am way more cautious/nervous closing now, but actually I put my two weeks tonight and got a new job. It's just too much of an uneasy feeling at my current job   When he told me not to move, and had the gun to my temple, I told him I wasn't going anywhere. That was all I really said to him.. I didn't really think to say anything to him to be honest, I really just wanted the whole thing to be over so talking to him may have just kept him there longer.   At first when I saw him come from the back I thought it was a joke until he came right next to me and put the gun in my face and put his hand on my shoulder and pushed me to my knees and then down on my stomach and told me to stay there. What's funny tho is I have thought in the past if something like this was to happen to me, I would totally just knock the gun out of his hand and tackle the dude and blah blah blah but when it happened, none of those thoughts came into my head. The robber said if I moved, or saw the cops or didn't get all the money he was going to spray my head all over the floor and even though he got everything he came there for, I was about 90% sure I was going to die that night because he could have done it so easy.. And the only thing that was honestly going through my head was I didn't want to die and that it was very cold on the floor and not a place I wanted to die.      I decided to take a hike with my dog and reflect on what happened and I can honestly say it was one of the most satisfying hikes I have taken in a very very long time. The sun seemed to shine a little brighter too      I am a male and yes he barked orders at me to get on the ground bt at first I thought it was some sort of joke bt once the gun was in my face, I figured wasn't and at that point I told him to take it easy as I was getting on the ground and when he told me not to move as the gun was on my head I told him I wasn't going anywhere, so I guess we talked..   Hahaha no, we think he was just passing thru town bc we are off a major highway.. At least that's what the cops think    Well the short of it is, I was closing up at the bar I work at in my little Mtn town I live in around 12am on a Friday. Guy came out the back, drew a gun on me and made me get to the floor while my co worker emptied the register.. All the while having the gun pressed to my temple as I lay on the ground.. Ask me anything, I can give more details and nothing is off limits.

 When you remember me, it means that you have carried something of who I am with you, that I have left some mark of who I am on who you are. It means that you can summon me back to your mind even though countless years and miles may stand between us. It means that if we meet again, you will know me. It means that even after I die, you can still see my face and hear my voice and speak to me in your heart. For as long as you remember me, I am never entirely lost. When I'm feeling most ghost-like, it is your remembering me that helps remind me that I actually exist. When I'm feeling sad, it's my consolation. When I'm feeling happy, it's part of why I feel that way. If you forget me, one of the ways I remember who I am will be gone. If you forget, part of who I am will be gone.

So one Saturday morning a few years ago I was in my car driving to get breakfast. I had a headache that morning and decided to take some  Headache Powder to get rid of the pain  OK, so I forgot the AC was on and the powder blows right into my face making it look like I was doing coke and when the powder hits my eyes I run off the road.As my eyes opened, I swerved to the left RIGHT IN FRONT OF A STATE TROOPER. So, I missed him and he turns around. Little did I know I had a few empty beer bottles I had in a bag in the car and it smelled like I had a party in the passenger seat floor. He turns his lights on and here I am driving down the road with powder on my face and empty beer bottles I was supposed to throw away.  Luckily I explained, got my car searched and everything was ok.   Geocities, Yahoo Chat, IGN, TOTSE, Textfiles, Napster, AOL.   Pussy.   Was you expecting Shakespeare?   Pussy.

 History in making :  http://i.imgur.com/z4U4W27.jpg http://i.imgur.com/NtMNAWK.jpg http://i.imgur.com/yQBW41W.jpg    OP = Faggot  http://i.imgur.com/yQBW41W.jpg   I saw two people. Yay!  http://i.imgur.com/clk5n6G.jpg   Did I miss it?            I remember listening to a trap remix version of the song that replaced the kid saying "Na na la la la la na na" with a sick beat. I really liked that version but I'm not able to find it anywhere on YouTube. Could anyone of you help?          What's up with the Upvotes for this thing? I have seen it drop from 25K to 14K to now 11K. Is this some Reddit Algorithm we are unaware about?   This show is really reaching Game Of Thrones level for me.   	12
 yeah, my brother and I are 10 years and 5 months apart (I only mention the months bc for half the year it makes it seem like its 11 years difference), and our baby pictures are identical.  Based on photographs, we looked identical and grew at an identical rate based on our wall growth charts (mine is still on the wall; they're side by side).  It wasn't until about 8 or so that he started to differentiate more and grow at a faster rate than I did. I'm a woman, btw.  My little brother looked pretty much identical to me at the same age throughout his younger childhood.   I sometimes hear my mom or dad say things when they're actually not even in that part of the house.  It freaks them out more than it does me, because they believe it means they're going to die or something, kind of like what you're saying.   good; I was going to link to the same   because you were a child and believed you could do it.  Now that capacity is blocked by the constraints you have learned since then.  yours is a very extreme case, but I firmly believe that we seriously limit our own mental capacity by accepting explanations of the world that are truly just theoretical and can't be concretely proven.   or it could have been a trap.... https://uk.answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20130206130953AArCZUW    maybe he's a ghost of a magician who didn't get recognition in life and just wants to put smiles on people's faces and make an impression   well reading minds in that sense (numbers and specific items of information that the person is actively thinking about) is not particularly difficult or uncommon.    What you talk about reading people, as in picking up on emotions and stuff, it's just like a more practiced form of the same sort of sense.  I've freaked people out with it too.  However, this card guy was far better at it I'm sure.  His track record was probably so good/ he had such an easy time "reading" the cards from your minds, because he got plenty of practice by hanging around the college kids.    Thanks for the idea for a skill-builder exercise.  That is much better than just asking a friend to think of a number.   your title made it sound like the building had disappeared :)   If my homework were based on my reddit,  I would already be done, and have extra-credit.   thanks for the tip!   We just made a google doc and were in a video call so we could talk verbally, and we just wrote it together.  you can work with people by writing a paragraph each, back and forth, like /r/passtheparagraph or you can just talk it out and add things, or write until a logical stopping point/ you run out of ideas, and then let the other person take over.   It's a nice thing to do when you're both bored   I am American as well.     I don't say it to people a whole lot, but this is one of my favorites:  "Of course it is happening inside your head, Harry, but why on earth should that mean that it is not real?" - Dumbledore in the Deathly Hallows.    I studied Criminal Justice in undergrad (working towards being an attorney), so I've heard plenty about the disturbing things inmates will do, especially those harboring the infections you mentioned and who feel they have nothing to lose.  However, those people do not make all of the inmates "human garbage". There are inmates who really are  "legit" "victims of circumstance".    In the women's prison in my state, there is one lady in particular that we got to meet and speak to, who is serving a life sentence because, while she was asleep, her ex took her car to commit a murder and when he told her about it the next day, as he was already abusive, she was too afraid to come forward.  This makes her an accessory after the fact.  However, in my state, there is no legal distinction for "accessory".  All those involved in any way get charged with murder.   They say she got life (the max) because the judge wanted to make an example of her, but that is neither here nor there.  If you want to argue about her being in an abusive relationship in the first place, people end up there by being too trusting and forgiving; that's the only fault that makes someone end up there, and you don't realize you're in that situation until it actually gets ugly, at which point, it is dangerous to try to leave.  People in those situations feel trapped, and if they don't have a support system to reach out to or a method to contact authorities without being stopped and beaten for it, then they kind of are trapped to an extent.  She is not garbage.   The thousands of people serving life (or several decades) sentences for possession of marijuana are not garbage either.  Regardless of your views on marijuana, in moderate amounts it has been scientifically proven to be far less harmful than cigarettes or alcohol to say the least, and the extracts from it (cannabis oil) can stop seizures and help cancer patients (I can source this if you take issue with data).  People in the marijuana scene for the most part are not bad people.  At the very least, they are not garbage.  I would argue against calling any person garbage, but it would be acceptable for the nutcases who try to give people incurable diseases just for spite.  Anyhow, now that I'm done cross-examining your rant, the paranormal experience:  A vengeful spirit coming after their murderer is not too surprising from a psychological standpoint; given this person's history of an abusive personality, revenge surely fits the profile.  If she killed her abuser, it would most likely have been a self-defense situation or a crime of passion, meaning he could also either feel he has unfinished business in the beating she stopped him from delivering (trying to get in his twisted mind here (applying the Forensic Psychology I studied as well; not just pulling from the air)), or, if it was the latter, a crime of passion, then he may feel betrayed (from her being his to dominate) and thus feels the need to assert his dominance.  As cited above, it can be incredibly hard for someone to get away from an abuser though normal means.  If it came down to the last resort, killing them, and then you still weren't safe from them, that would be some kind of hell; she may feel like it was all for nothing and she'll never be free of him.    It's interesting that you could see him though, before hand, but couldn't see him when he was behind your partner; same with how you saw a shadow in some cameras but only moving objects in others.  Maybe he wanted you to see him at those points.  The other possibility is that for some reason you were more receptive/perceptive of his presence at those points in time, possibly in relation to situational factors (lighting? presence of other people in the room?), or it could be in relation to physical actions taken by the poltergeist.  Maybe, since you said you didn't see the shadow when objects were moved, poltergeists are less visible when taking or preparing to take physical action.  That possibility just makes the fact that you couldn't see him behind your friend even scarier.   Definitely want to try to get rid of a dangerous spirit like that, although it is not your problem, and he probably won't move on until she's dead, either because that's what he wants, or because he will torment her until the say of her natural death, as his revenge.    Either way, you may see more of him until she is gone/moved or you are.   ha ha; the held back is probably partially going for a softer style and partially psychological from being in a dorm room!    No, I have never had singing lessons, but I have been singing on my own my whole life really, and in my church's choir for a handful of years.  I have noted drastic improvements from when I first started recording (six years ago *shudders*) to now, but I know there's a lot more I can improve on.     As far as the mic goes, yeah, I actually did three takes of this because I got too into it the first two times and got intimate with the mic, causing distortion; that may also be why I was holding back.  Anyway, thank you for pointing that out; it helped me realize I am still holding back sometimes in here, and that I still haven't found the sweet spot to sit from the mic in this new setup.  thanks for listening!   Nice work overall; I think, however, you could use more variety in the bass and tone down the treble.  You really only have a steady boom going for the bass.  You need to have the base move along with the chords of the main tune; this will give the track more life/depth.  I hope that is helpful!   excellent!  you had me tapping along within the first 30 seconds.  Only thing I can recommend is to maybe end with the same sounds from the beginning, so that it comes full circle, and ends maybe with one of those tones going up; just think it would be a nice touch.   very nice!  I am not familiar with the original, but I would recommend toning down the noise (by which I mean the fuzz/overblow) around the 1:20 and 2:00 marks for example, if possible.  It may be nicer on the ears with at least somewhat clearer tones.   I wrote this and recorded it today.  I normally do pop rock / alternative, so this is somewhat softer than my usual style, so I am looking for constructive criticism please I would really appreciate it.    The song is called [Therapy] (https://soundcloud.com/test_subject8889/therapy)  (for reference I use a USB studio condenser mic if that means anything to you.)  Thank you in advance!   no, but you can patent an invention or copyright a screenplay   yes; I found out about wordle when I was writing my first novel back in 2008.  It was in two parts, so I made a wordle from each part; I thought of maybe including the result as a page in the published book, at the beginning of the respective parts.  It is a great visual aid and quite pretty to look at.   hi; I've only read excerpts of your books and seen some of your videos (all of which were excellent, btw; I love the way they are organized), and (as I write, blog, and make music) I was wondering:  **What did you find most surprising about 'making it' as a writer and as a youtuber?  as in, things that were much easier or harder than expected, or unexpected obstacles which you faced in the process?   **   I saw the title and thought of him too, sneaking in through someone's window, so don't worry   given that it was tiny and detailed, and her writing was large and floppy, I assumed the killer drew her in the park.   I would think that as long as it is different enough, or only a slight preview, it doesn't matter, but I don't really know.   I'm just basing that off of PenPal from /r/nosleep .  The author took the series, fleshed it out, exapnded upon it, and then published the result as a full-fledged Amazon book.  However, the original stories are still online on nosleep   get it copyrighted first.     well you can read kindle books on pc, and nook (for one) can use the kindle app as can any other android device, be it a phone, tablet, etc.  Even windows mobile devices can use the kindle app.     there is also an amazing comic that fits this prompt, which I discovered from someone linking it in a comment somewhere....found it: https://imgur.com/gallery/h2my0   Drama: He bided his time before asking her out.  Even once they were together, he carefully observed her actions and words; he was the attentive listener women say they want to find.  He made sure to be there for her whenever she might need him.  Although she led a busy life, he would always clear his schedule for her.  He had come to love her favorite restaurant almost as much as she did.  He could see them growing old together, and going to that cozy restaurant by the pier for every anniversary.  Then, he got a phone call which made his whole world shatter.  Comedy: She thought he was a nice guy, and he seemed to be really interested, so she figured she could give it a shot; it's whatever.  She lied about having to work late sometimes so that she could hang out with her superficial friends instead.  He always seemed to give her even more attention after such nights.  It's funny how a little distance can make people want you more.  She chuckled at the thought of him chasing after her like a confused puppy. He made some of the silliest, and to her mind, stupidest faces sometimes, especially when he just looked at her.  He was a real clown.  She kept going with him to the same restaurant on the pier; she could think of nothing else to do with him other than have good food and good fun.  Although it was her favorite restaurant, she was getting tired of going there; they had worn it out.  So she picked up the phone.  -----------  [I know that's not really funny, but when I read the prompt, I thought of this sort of relationship, and how to him its serious (drama) but to her its just a game (comedy).  hope you like it anyways ]   thank you for the quick reply!   the issue here being, although it is my writing, the idea would have originated from a prompt thought of by someone else.  So, it would be prompt inspired.    So, I think it would be ok to publish as long as I credited the prompt idea, but that only applies to publishing on a personal webpage or something similar.  What if I wanted to expand upon the idea and publish the resulting longer, more developed story in a publication which pays for submissions?  Is it ok to do that?      I read your previous post and this one.  I have no experience with entities inflicting physical damage to a person, only mental and emotional.  drawing blood is serious, obviously.    If you're looking for a logical explanation, (well even not, I think that's the starting point if for nothing else to rule it out):  there's the possibility it was the cat, and there's the possibility that you sleepwalk/other sleep actions.  To that end, you mentioned in your comments linked to in the previous post, that you have done hallucinogens.  Did those, by any chance include LSD?  If so, it is possible for you to experience a random acid trip.  I'm not saying the scratches aren't real.  Not at all.  I'm just mentioning, in case you didn't know, that you are subject to that.  Ok, logical bases covered, the next is the usual suspects: poltergeist.  This is what you seemed to be describing for the post part in Chicago.  For this incident, if an entity of some sort caused these scratches, it would have to be either a poltergeist or a demonic entity.    If, given your history, you don't sense anything, I don't think there's really a risk that it's anything demonic.  It may be a poltergeist who has taken issue with your bf and thus has not presented anything to you.    Someone mentioned something following you; that would be an attached spirit.  Ususally attached spirits are benign or benevolent.  A malevolent spirit would only attach to a person if they had specific beef with them and were looking for revenge or to torment them.  Normally, malevolent/vengeful spirits are tied to places, such as where they died.  So I don't think an attached spirit is possible in this case.  Unless they'd have a reason to want to drive your bf away to protect you, although your ex sounds like more of a person from which you'd need protection, so that idea has no traction either.  Speaking of Liam, I had a thought while reading the previous post.  Did he use heroin before moving into that house?  Did they move into that house not too long before?  or when he was younger?  if it was a more recent move, its possible the ghost of the heroin addict drove him to try it.  You mentioned using hallucinogens.  Did you ever do that before living in that house with Liam?  Clearly he was a bad influence regardless, but I wonder if he had been negatively influenced by the spirits in the home as well.  Just my thoughts.  Hope something in here is helpful to you.   Sorry for rambling.   made me tear up.  thanks for sharing!   she is really open to it/ perceptive of it I guess.  I assume you mean physically see with her eyes?  or do you mean in her mind's eye that she can feel them and visualizes them as dots?   oh, then you are missing out.  I personally liked his Words Words Words special (it was on Comedy Central) a little better than What.  That was how I first found out about him.        no the rule is to have more than one account; one for normal things using your usual un, and one for other things   thanks! :)   I, not realizing I'd read your posts before, was one of the "dome people", lol     	41

It's the [guy from the Internet!](http://dilbert.com/strip/2015-06-07)   I spent years having to listen to ignorant, racist assholes tell stupid fucking jokes like this at work. Thankfully, I'm no longer working in an environment like that. I'm glad you lost your job, because if you're saying shit like this at work then you need to learn a fucking lesson.  Edit: A lot of the replies to this comment are absolutely abhorrent. I'm not sure if they're jokes or meant to be serious. Regardless, it's very disheartening to see so much racism in this thread. I know it's the Internet, but I expected more from reddit. I genuinely hope that despite whatever hateful things your parents taught you, you break the circle of ignorance by not passing down your racist attitudes to your children. They deserve better. The world deserves better.   I downvote every comment I see that is edited like yours, and I hope others do the same.   A person lives in this server.

I liked the pictures with the boobies.   Just because you did those things doesn't make you a bad person. You're working on changing the things in your life that have caused you to hurt yourself and others, and it takes a strong, courageous person to do that. Keep fighting and maintain that courage and you'll have no reason to feel guilty.   If that's the worst that's ever happened to you, consider yourself lucky.   The fuck? There's no way this is real.   What do you feel guilty about?

I couldn't find one summing up water usage, but there's definitely more than one out there in the interwebz.      [Here's another interesting info graphic showing how much water is consumed during the lifecycle of a typical beef cow.] (http://static1.squarespace.com/static/53ddf6b0e4b0219ea2c8b53f/t/5486139ae4b08d78fd1dd863/1418072986569/) And this is the [source for that picture](http://www.swissbiofarmer.com/blog/).   Cows are the most land and water intensive livestock to raise. That's why people in many countries eat less beef and tend to eat more pork, goat, and other smaller farm animals that can be kept in smaller spaces. Also, people in other countries tend to eat a lot less of everything than the average North American.   How are you adjusting to life outside of a cult?   Trolls? I though this was real! HYUK!

I thought to myself as the site loaded for what felt like an eternity, "This better fucking well be worth it." And it was.   It's sad how little progress has been made in United States' backwards penal system. Tell an American that, though, and I'm sure they'll tell you otherwise.  	121
 Except 4 were chokes.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shane_Carwin   I know. I even checked before I posted my comment and nobody had called him out yet. Dude had about 750 upvotes, so likely 1000 people just voting on his comment and not one bothered to fact check it? Like really?   Yes he is. By average of the polls over the last month, he's in first place actually. The worst he's doing in any poll is 2nd, by 3%.  http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/us/2016_republican_presidential_nomination-3823.html   Ok but I'm saying if they get terrible they won't get better.   Ok let's be real:  1) The reason we say don't vote for third parties is because of the spoiler effect leading to possibly your least favorite choice winning.  2) Obviously an individual vote doesn't make a difference. The closest vote in electoral history was Florida in 2000 that had a difference of 537 votes (Source: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_close_election_results).  3) Thus, the reason we say don't vote third party is because we don't want people to encourage others to vote third party because then we may end up with the least desirable candidate winning.  4) So even if you live in a non-swing state, you shouldn't encourage others to vote third party because it may turn your state into a swing state if you have enough sway, or if you make a few people decide to vote third and they in turn make people decide to vote third in the next election and so on, until your state that would have been a safe state is now a swing state a few elections down the road.   While this is true on a micro level, if you start it and others follow then eventually enough may follow so that your state turns into a swing state.   But if you don't follow the rules, then the greater evil candidate can win. And they DEFINITELY won't change it so that your vote elects someone else.   Because you don't change it by voting for your favorite candidate. Think of it this way: if there's a democrat you're meh on, an independent you love, and a republican you hate- and you (and enough others) vote for the independent, causing the republican to win where the democrat otherwise would have- then the republicans are in charge and your arugment is that this will somehow be a message to them to change the voting system? Maybe it will, but wouldn't they be completely disincentivized from changing the system because they won in the current system?  You need to change the electoral system before you abide by its voting rules.   Wouldn't that get a little confusing with current President Clinton?   Completely agree. But until we change the electoral system, we must play by their rules.   Vote for whoever you want in the primary, but when it comes to the General, you need to pick the lesser of the two evils. Otherwise you risk splitting the vote and having the least desirable candidate win.   Yea, but you'll also go to jail. So you may be "up" $10K, but then you spend 2 years in jail not earning money during that time.   List all loans with interest rate and all income and expenses   Wait what goes in that last blank? Nearby street name?   Or fired when they realize your job is automated...   Dude's about to make a killing. Likely punitive damages after his lawyer argues that this is just the first time the cops got caught.   For real. As a 1L I've only ever talked to 2Ls. Also, this would have been more appropriate to post last semester. I know what I'm doing now.   You linked Austin and he's in Houston FYI.   For real. I would feel very good about volunteering to do this for a weekend. Is there any place I can search to see if these fake clinics are in my area?   This just made me think: if there are pro-life protesters outside of abortion clinics, couldn't pro-choice protesters go stand outside of these fake clinics and warn people?   .   Don't do this without consulting a lawyer first.   Ah I though you were saying waive it for the year, not permanently. That seems like a long shot but I see your logic.   Hire a lawyer to investigate.  Possible they have a different person with the same name. Possible he was convicted in absence (although then he would have had a warrant and the cops would not have let him go). Possible the clerk just entered it in wrong.   If they waive the graduation requirement he'll still have to complete the classes though and thus wouldn't be able to attend the college anyways. But if he does summer classes, they wouldn't have to waive the requirement.   Your family should hire a lawyer. If you completed the classes, I'm not sure they can withhold the credits, even if it's "policy." However, I could easily be wrong. A quick consult with a lawyer should clear it up.  As others have pointed out, can you do summer school for the credits? Through your current high school or community college?  Oh I just thought of another idea! Can you have your Wisconsin high school transfer the credits back to Ohio school and graduate from there?    Just a note, but you usually have a duty to return the apt to the condition you received it in. So if it was filthy (AND YOU CAN PROVE THAT) then you would at least likely get the "extra cleaning" fee back.  Other than that, by looks the door knob is 3x the price, the covers are 2x and everything else looks somewhat reasonable.   Age is really the defining factor on if this was child abuse.   Well well well. How the tables have turned...   Not over 4%, 3.8%. Yes, 2.07% is the average for past 10 years and usually the target inflation rate. A plausible rate would 2% + whatever % accounts for defaults.   4%?!? Inflation rates are currently close to 0%. It hasn't been over 4% in the last 24 years.  http://www.usinflationcalculator.com/inflation/historical-inflation-rates/   Now I'm imagining a world where every person in a seedy bar files rape charges against their one night stand when they find out their partner was not a "secret agent" the next morning.   Maybe so.   Well he's likely worried about it getting worse.   Exactly! That's why the high school student is saying he's afraid of the crisis! Because even if he has perfectly legit credit, it may be too restricted.   So he's wrong... Like I said.   I skimmed and must have missed it. I guess don't respond if you don't want to.   It severely increased the requirements, which is what the high school student is concerned about.   Ha, no.   Wait how? Just because the electoral numbers don't add up? It doesn't work like that.  Perot was much closer to Bush than he was Clinton. So if we say for example that, of those who voted for Perot, 60% would vote for Bush and 40% for Clinton, Bush would have a clear majority of votes. Then you'd have to distribute that on a state by state basis, but the consensus is that Bush would have won.   Duverger's Law. Our current system is set up so there will only ever be two parties. You're supposed to pick the lesser evil of the two.   Because if banks see graduates not paying their loans then the banks won't make any more loans in the future.   Likely whatever state your grandfather was in.   Likely yes, if your mother died after your grandfather.  You'll want to hire an attorney.  Also don't be surprised if a substantial part of the money has already been spent by your aunt.   Sally saw it.   Best thing you can do to driver her away from him is make her see him as she sees you. Next time he's over offer him a beer and sit in the backyard talking about 401Ks and taxes. Ask how his golf game is. Anything to make her see him as old.   It'd be funny if the parents were still paying Lucas.   Ok fine let's say they are legally retarded, defined as IQ under 70 (if I remember correctly) and they believe they are not, and hire me to follow them around telling them they're not.  However, to your substantive point, I agree they are still evil scum taking advantage of a vulnerable population. Further, I agree that we, as a society, have a duty to identify vulnerable populations and expose them to other methods that can help them instead of letting them fall prey to bad influences.  From a Due Process standpoint, we cannot merely make it illegal to charge for "reading fortunes" without a host of other issues. Instead, we could treat it like the Pay Day Loan industry and heavily regulate it where people can still use the services but are substantially less likely to be **completely** taken advantage of.   Ok, let's say a person believes they are beautiful but everyone calls them ugly. So they hire me to follow them around all day calling them beautiful. Even though it's a lie, it makes them feel good. Why should they not be able to do this? It's their own free will. Yea they could get better support from a psychiatrist, but they chose me to make them feel better.   That is realistically the only way I see him winning.   I agree. Obviously, in real life, the line is crossed much more frequently from "person helping widow get over her grief" to "taking every penny possible."  It's a crap business to be in on either side for completely different reasons.   Yea I see your point. To further play devil's advocate: let's say there's an old couple with no kids or family. The husband dies. The wife believes in mediums. Why shouldn't she get to spend the rest of her money to "talk" to her husband? It's still 100% her choice. Nobody if forcing her to spend the money.   To buy out an entire theater on opening day for a popular movie would be what the theater expected to make plus a fee. So assuming it sold out and you only wanted the theater for one showing time, lets say $10/ticket and $150 seats, you could probably rent it out for $2,000. But you still have to drive there, sit in crappy seats, and be seen in public, which isn't feasible if you're Lebron.   See I get the hate, but then a part of me thinks if it actually comforts the person is it not worth something? Obviously $10K would be wayyyy over the top. But if for something like $100 someone was comforted that their dead loved one was "doing well in the afterlife" that would be reasonable, right?   I would agree with the statement that we know nothing concrete from all presidential elections, especially because they are spread out over such a large period of time. That's not to say we know nothing of election theory because we have many thousands to analyze in the last 10 years alone, in the US.   Nobody is in charge. Who is "they" in your "they wouldn't run her again" example?  It's all just voters voting on whoever has enough name recognition and screws up the least.   n=10 is NOTHING in statistics. You need a sample size of at least 1000 to to even establish a weak correlation, let alone causation.   In your situation, assuming you are moving states, it would seem wise to move as soon as your last final ends and just come back for graduation. Or you could just skip it.   Not the person you replied to but I'd imagine if he continued to live like he was near homeless (think $20K) on a salary of someone who finished graduate school (maybe $100K) and invested that at 7% (average stock market return), he could easily be a millionaire in 13 years.   RED ALERT ON PRO #2!!!  Even if the seller is an attorney, you pay your own attorney to look over the contract and advise you. He could easily write a contract with a term you don't understand and screw you over with, **especially because he's an attorney.** It will not be a big expense compared to all the other closing costs. You'll still want title insurance, a survey, and inspection (which will all be required by the bank anyways). Do not cheap out on the attorney, or it could easily come back to bit you for 10 times the cost.  Other than that, just be aware you will independently (as in without your friend) be responsible for the entire mortgage payment if the upstairs rents move out.  Also be aware of the potential costs you're taking on. Water heater/AC break? Your expense. Tenants upstairs literally begin taking axes to the walls? You'll need to take proper eviction proceedings and know how to do that (you'll need an attorney). This will require an emergency fund for the house specifically of at least $10,000.

W   I tried to look at the MTurk article, admittedly not thoroughly, and didn't see what they defined as "child." Is it just under 18? Cause then like 99% of guys would be attracted to a post-pubescent "hot" 17 year old. And then that would make the study a lot less noteworthy in my opinion.   Would you like to bet on it?   No round winner or loser. It's a tie.   Ok but if it's your injuries you would want pictures then?   Nope.  I'm saying ROUNDS can be competitive, even where the FIGHT isn't even close.  Example: if every round was identical, with Also outstriking Mendes by a single punch each round with the power and everything else even, then it would be a clear 50-45. That's a fight that's not even close but was competitive as hell.   If you're employees are not busy at some points, you could have them hold a sign counter-protesting with something like "We did give him correct change. Ask me about it." and have the employee give a short blurb if you're worried about losing potential customers.  Plus, since this guy seems a little nuts, if he threatens any employee you can report it to the police.   If I were you, I would tell your landlord that you won't be moving out. Instead, move stuff to be reasonably messy around the house. By early May, (s)he'll be begging you to move out and likely offer you some money instead of you paying for months you won't even live there.  Your landlord is strong arming you right now because it's working. Stop play by their rules. You can easily flip the tables.   For real. I've paid about $5,000 on my cat's various illnesses. I know technically she's worth maybe $20, but to me she's worth a lot more.  A lot of time on /r/legaladvice I see very uncaring attitudes. I wish people giving advice on here showed a little more compassion sometimes.   Eh I guess he'll just have to face Khabib instead.   I love that you set your post up so that someone answering "yes" means two different things. It depends if they're replying to your title or the text body.   Completely agreed. I think a competitive fight can still result in a clear decision.   I completely agree. I'm not saying it wasn't competitive, only that Aldo clearly won and it wasn't close (by that I mean, it wasn't very arguable that Mendes won).   Then you consented to the search. The proper thing to do in that situation would have been to wait for the dogs.   If you clearly win 4 rounds, then you clearly win the fight.   What reason did they give for searching after you denied?   I actually agree with you. Frankie is a much busier fighter. I know it wasn't a lot of time, but even in this fight, Lamas was hitting Mendes much more before he was dropped. Frankie is non-stop work for 25 minutes. If he avoids getting caught, I think he takes Mendes.   Every judge had it 49-46. That's not that close. Granted some of the rounds weren't runaways, but they were all pretty clear.   Well maybe they really do hate him. Can't imagine why.   Agreed. I see it as the classic two wrestlers end up in a striking match. And I think Frankie is just busier and more accurate. Granted Mendes has more power, but as long as Frankie doesn't get caught too badly (although he does have a hell of a chin), he'll grab a unanimous decision.   I think of a super fight as 2 champs fights. If Aldo gets the immediate shot it'll be a super fight to me.   And the 1 win was a split decision.   Oh thanks.   Not to mention that we're going to be seeing JBJ with more cardio than he's ever had before, because he won't be dealing with a weight cut.   I'm pretty positive Aldo will move up after his win and get an immediate title shot. You'll have a super fight in early 2016.   See I always think that, but the way Edgar just absolutely manhandled Cub makes me question it.  I sincerely hope Aldo moves up after McG, and Edgar sweeps the floor with Urijah and we get Mendes/Edgar for new championship. That's the only fight in the division that would make be worthy of a championship fight after Aldo leaves.   I just want your post to have at least one positive comment. I agree with you.   The fans were booing the decision, not the fighters. At least that's how I interpret booing after a close decision.   You don't have to verbally tell the victim, just make them apprehensive. Walking at them with your fist raised would usually be more than enough in most jurisdictions.   I'm in San Diego. That about as South and West you can get. Get ready for the expensive housing though.   Usually assault too though.   Thanks so much man!   Ok that's the thing I don't know. I haven't driven a manual since I was 15.   Thanks for the insight. I think I'm just gonna have to bite the bullet and thank myself later.   Where would I find these? Is there a specific website? I'm in California if that helps.   So if I tank this semester just enough....   Thank you for your input.   I don't get this reference. Is there a manufacturing problem with the car?   That's another thing I was afraid of. This coming Fall, assuming my grades stay stable, I don't want to be asked why I'm not on it and have it come off as if I'm lazy.  Do you know approximately the time commitment per week?   Real way to fix the problem: sit in one of the first 2 rows.   I am decently sure I'll be an automatic admit to Law Review after 1L finishes. I'm wondering how much it actually helps in job searches. I have zero interest in actually reading, writing, or editing articles in excess to classes and an internship, but if it gives me a big boost I'll do it.  Any input appreciated.   Didn't even know of that subreddit! Thanks!   No gear to move. No kids. Not fat or tall. No snow.  Which of the cars you mentioned is best? I assume the smaller for better MPG?   Budget is anything up to $20,000 really. But I don't want to pay anywhere near that. Just whatever is the most cost cost effective.  As for what I require: literally nothing except basic safety.  I realize this is broad, but I'm just trying to find what the best deal possible is.  	104
 Did it. Also you should ask her out   Absolutely dude I'm so fucked, like bent over the table with a meterstick in my ass and a multimeter hooked up to my nipples fucked.

 You should just call me a faggot.    Reverse the roles and say the two white guys called the man a nigger, then assaulted him with a chair. Do you see a hate crime there?    It kills me to think that this man and his family have most likely been subjected to some sort of discrimination based on the color of their skin. Yet, he feels totally within his rights to strike someone walking away based on their sexual preference.   The fuck is wrong with people.   My first question would have been "are you inviting me in?" but that would probably make me a bad Jehova's Witness.

 Izzy left for france ages ago. Axl always swore he was anti-everything. Looks like he's a drinker though from that pic up above. Fat!    OH NO! I had not seen this puffing up. Yowza.    Gummy Granny   Samesies.    It's frequently wrong, too. People are so bizarre to try to guess. I know too many people who have been called Mexican-American when they are not, or African-American when they are not. So strange, bizarre cultural hangup.    Yep. He's European.    Saw them with Blind Melon not long before their lead singer died. Blind Melon came on stage and everyone boo'd and started chanting "GNR", and Shannon Hune said "shut the fuck up or we'll play longer"   He buttered her muffin and then played her the godfather theme.  Like so: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOoRECN0C5g   I was waiting to board a plane when I noticed a guy wearing a great t-shirt. It was a drawing of a classic nintendo, and under it "You always remember your first". Loved the shirt. Got on the plane, took off, and the stewardesses were serving drinks. A woman one row up got coffee. The stewardess spilled the coffee on the woman's baby, who immediately began shrieking. Meanwhile my kid had just fallen asleep, double concern for the burned baby and now my kid, who might actually SLEEP through a plane ride, is going to wake up screaming too. They asked whether anyone on the plane was a doctor and the nintendo t-shirt guy was a pediatrician.        Wrong. No one ever "asks" for a loaded gun pointed at his face. Got a dispute? get out of your big metal vehicle and talk about it like an adult. This is shit that should land him in prison for a long fucking time, and a lifelong ban on owning firearms. ABSURD.    Absolutely illegal.    Would love to know that guy lost his right to ever own a gun again. That is absolutely unbelievable.    Where ARE all those responsible gun owners? Please, all of you band together and take down these NRA fucktards terrorizing america.       Libertarians and the tea party are a combo of paid shills and fucking idiots.    Actually he has a huge raging clue. Read up on his history in Vermont, the change in voter turnout after his first term, the coming there and his policies.    But we can let it slide.   Edit: weird! A slide pun and downvoted. Ach, this photo major is disgusted with reddit.    They've also identified the shooter.  https://www.facebook.com/alex.winn.71 http://imgur.com/Cqa5VO2         If the story of Kalief doesn't make you cry, I think you should get checked out. Absolutely horrific. The shit of nightmares. Everyone involved in his case should spend a few years at Ryker's while their lives disintegrate. And his mom should get many million dollars, obviously nothing can bring her son back but let's take away the worries we can in her life.    then he's humming ***What would you do for a KLONDIKE BAR!?***   What about the nail!?!? **my vagina is fucking wincing**   They're all haunted. Bugged? Probably.       And take away his right to terrorize with guns. If he's so fearful he should really be in therapy. If the zoo is that unsafe, call in the national guard to protect us. Bubba is just making us less safe.    Making people unsafe so he can wave his pretend dick around and endanger children out with their families = exhibiting a constitutional right? No, my friend. He is a terrorist. Sanity rules.    So glad the judge is ruling on the side of safety. Ugh. As a parent, I'm over it. Enough. There are so many dead kids in our country right now because of this shit. No, you don't need your gun at the zoo. If you feel so unsafe at a zoo that you feel you need a weapon like that, go see a god damned therapist and stop ruining America.       A decades-old gun law in Connecticut requiring residents to have a permit before purchasing a handgun is credited with helping to reduce the state's firearms-related homicide rate by 40 percent, according to a new study.      Vote Bernie FFS         That is incredibly interesting and reasonable.    Can I ask if you had a cesarean delivery?   Yep. And we lose them at 5-6.    Bravo! Extended BF-er myself.

"One of the individuals made the statement that if it was God's will to shoot children and teachers, and if the other suspect wanted the suspect to do so, they would have proceeded to start shooting children and teachers," Holland said.                     I think it was the death of a man and injury of 3 others that makes the call for change so imperative.  Wal-Mart truck driven by Kevin Roper crashed into a vehicle carrying Morgan and his entourage. One person, James McNair, was killed, while three were injured.             Yeah, I think there might be a "new wave" of young adults on reddit with no critical analysis skills. Isn't that what they got rid of in the Dubbya era?   off my lawn, etc.      I want to see congressional hearings on this case.    I wish we had elections and politics that dealt with this type of shit, instead of whatever the GOP is on about these days. Promoting more weapons and less access to women's healthcare? Berating Obama?    Gotta think the social skills and physical activity at preschool make it the better choice though. When you sit watching tv, your heart rate is like you're asleep, right?    There is a huge push for Single Payer in the US right now. It's comin.                           Each of the ninety dead Americans each day should be a headline. If it were, people would have awareness of the plague that is guns in America.    I read that as saying it was the shooter whose nice-people label was taken into question.    The right wing has grown into a large right tumor that's infected much of our nation. Living through a terrorist sniper for the last month in northern Colorado. It's fucked beyond belief.    2015 is the year of the gun in America. Convincing many to move to Canada.    Wait wait wait wait wait...a three year old accesses a gun, shoots himself, and no charges are filed?! You know, if that kid found a pot brownie and ate it, he'd probably be removed from the home and charges filed against both parents. Oh America pull the gun barrel out of your fucking ass.    Such as...?   That's disappointing and horrific all in one.                   Right? Should've gone with "upper cellar" #obv!    Are you a parent?   I have a great idea for an invention to stop this from happening. I emailed and wrote about it to people and heard nothing back. How can someone get a safety invention picked up? Not an inventor by trade so no fucking clue what to do with it, but as a mom I am ill every time I see a story like this. That mom's life is over. So much grief.

 I mean Davos. He's well-played and a compelling character, but it seemed like a bit of a cheat that he survived the wildfire explosion when he was so near he could see wildfire leaking out the back of the ship. With him dying, it seemed to give more resonance to the fleet being destroyed and it gave more of a human face to all the people that died in that scene. As is, the main character we've gotten to know who died at that battle was Davos's son, who was kind of one-note and unlikable.    Like, how did the Soviet news report on their involvement in Vietnam? Did they deny it on their news? Did they say "Yeah, we're doing all this and it's justified for the following reasons"? Did they have televised debates about things? If yes, we're they completely loaded debates?       Honestly, even as a kid, I remember thinking that bikes looked cooler than big wheels. But having since become very familiar with how uncomfortable bike seats are, I would be open to trying a design more like a big wheel these days.    No shotgun?   http://knowledgenuts.com/2015/03/14/how-thomas-edison-bankrupted-the-first-master-filmmaker/  I have a feeling there's more to the story than we're hearing since both main figures involved have since become larger-than-life since, but it's still an interesting story.       And Scratchy!   You were right.     "This is the kind of kid we grind up to use for the additives in your Lunchables."    Eh, it's just the few suicidal people throwing the averages off.       I'm not necessarily saying it's the deepest movie in the world, but when people praise Tree of Life (2011) for being like this really transcendent and the like, I assume they'd be able to explain why. But when I saw it, all I thought was "This is pretty! I like the music! That looks pretty too! Oh, this is moody!" I'm basically like a stoned six year-old when I watch that thing.   You have any that do that for you?     I thought for sure this was going to turn out to be a man wearing prosthetics.          Skip the scene where Tarantino is rambling, though.    AAUAUAAAGGGGGHHHH!   Tropic Thunder 2 on the horizon then?    What made you feel like doing an AMA?          No, Cupcakes references get inserted in the other end.    With deepest shame, I admit I find this hot.    A woman miscarried, was too fat to realize it (or that she'd ever been pregnant) and the fetus decomposed in her for some time.    Finish what you started, Wrex.    I'm Justin Bieber and I can't be 21 years old either.    Dude, we've seen Arya lose every time she holds up a sword against an armed opponent on equal footing and we've seen Brienne get rough and tumble while moving pretty fast. She could keep up with Jamie (admittedly when he was rusty but he was still probably in better shape than Arya.)   The Stark Girl would meet her butcher's boy.     I wonder how many times some passerbys decided to ruin a timelapse shot by messing with their camera.    Why aren't they fighting!? I was promised fighting!         Burton struck me as headstrong enough he would have been screwed pretty quickly in that situation.       Coffee flavor analyzed!   How much have you been in mortal danger since arriving?    I don't see any sources cited.    Yeah, but it was what happened to me from square one, so I can't relate to feeling lonely about it.    Hey, Steve? The mechanical shark is over there...   He ain't about to bite the Canadian Film Board's hand, though.    Like my next thing in mind is a guy who sort of goads the comment section a bit, so what are the rules for that? And another one is about a main character who's a white supremacist, what would be the policy for that?    That's it! Thanks!   Shame you didn't have a gopro on.    Nope. We needed to put Legolas and company in. No time in the nine hours for those guys.    When the hell was this movie witty? It was as broad as it gets.             Oh God, I worked at a restaurant for a couple years and those demanding types were often the worst tippers. Is it better over there?    What's your worst "customer from Hell" story?    My listicle won't write itself!   It's a 2d game, kind of a point n click if I remember right, which begins with a girl in some superficially pleasant but in truth creepy village about to be sacrificed to some monster.   Thanks for your time   He must have spent years telling people he was Francis Ford Coppola.          Don't ever wash her in the same bathtub as Rarity or the colors are going to run.

I keep hearing this piece of advice, but I am curious if there are any anecdotes of people who needed this advice? It seems like the sort of thing you wouldn't expect anyone to have thought in hindsight, but there's always someone who believed a surprising thing.    I guess I should have said "pacing" or something like that. Whatever, downvote it if you like.    Oh, so one snowman from back then looks creepy and then suddenly ALL snowmen looked creepy back then? #YesAllSnowmen   It's not really that impressive to have that much saved up by 28 if you don't do anything with your life except your job, but thank you for the compliment.    I was just watching Interstellar with my brother and he described to me afterwards how towards the end, he was thinking "end! End!" I asked him if what was happening was bad or uninteresting or something, and he said no, but he just felt like the movie should be over.   I really don't get people watching movies like they have to be film critics. I don't care if a scene doesn't drive the plot forward or if the "peaks and valleys" aren't timed out properly or whatever. I care how interesting the scene I'm watching is or if there's a likelihood based on previous scenes whether it will become interesting. That might say more about me than it does movies, but it just seems like caring about a movie's pace is just giving yourself a reason not to like it.       Suppose someone somehow got onto live television on that sort of show and delivered a rant similar to the one Bing Madsen delivers and then kills themselves, and it either airs or someone recorded it with a phone and then leaked it. How do you imagine you would react if you were watching?      I've lived in the same town for twenty-eight years. I've wanted to move for a long time but my livelihood is pretty tied to my location and the place I most want to move to isn't hiring in that field (I checked their local job listings.) I make a couple thousand off stuff I do online and have $30,000 saved up, but I've been worried it will all just crash and burn and then have to move back up here with a worse job.   So have any of you tried moving away from a town you're tired of, considered that a problem, etc. How'd it work out?    Still looking forward to Chappie, though.     No, or I guess I'm attached to it the way I'm attached to gum stuck to my fingers that I'm trying to flick off. I am actively working to get rid of it.     I read somewhere that he's supposed to have said that movies aren't ideally supposed to be "enjoyable" experiences. Can anyone confirm or deny that?       Thank you very much!      I remember reading that someone compiled a bunch of the most bizarre personal stories ever posted on Reddit. Like there was one from a medical professional about a woman who injected IV drugs into her taint, a "cumbox" that someone felt compelled to masturbate into, etc. Does anyone happen to remember that or have it saved?   Thanks for your time   So Pinkie's not a natural pink?    But when the Google corporation becomes elected president, it will be able to use its translate function for every language.    Suppose someone somehow got onto live television on that sort of show and delivered a rant similar to the one Bing Madsen delivers and then kills themselves, and it either airs or someone recorded it with a phone and then leaked it. How do you imagine you would react if you were watching?   ~If I could turn back time~   We find the machine works a lot better if you break the doll first.

I can't wait for the Pee Wee Herman poster that's a parody of the Under the Skin poster!      Do you know anything about self-employment taxes and paypal?   My question is: Does it count as a Paypal transaction if you transfer money to and from your own bank account?        Holy shit! In that case, thank god there are so many spiders in there keeping the mosquito population down!      Calling it: This trend will continue until the entire theater industry goes dead for a little while.    I don't know why, but the cut to the second camera and crash made me laugh.    I'M A FRENCH WOMAN! HA HA HA! French civilian, hi Yanks!   Oh yeah? Then why advertise or release the film at all? Shouldn't the only copy of this movie have been destroyed after it was completed and everyone involved forced to sign non-disclosure agreements if it was "all about secrecy?"    All the photoshop in the world can't make Ron look cool.       How could there possibly be enough insects to feed even a fraction of them?       Wait, are you saying there are puppies around? Let me just get my kickin' boots.    Unlike your precious pegasus friend, my head isn't up in the clouds.    The costs of shipping would be to great for anything bigger than a letter.

I got a couple messages from people on OKCupid and such.  I thought they were both unfunny, unattractive people and thought being alone would be better so in both cases I insulted myself at them to destroy their interest in me.       I hope not. I vastly prefer my ponies messing about to when they have to go on big adventures.       So. Fucking. Awesome!      I just wish they'd thought of a more meaningfull way to destroy the library than to have Tirek hit it with a t-shirt cannon so that it fell over a railing.    That looks like something a serial killer would make.       It's a guy named Grant Thompson with a channel called "King of Random."    Guybrush Creepwood.          How often have the whales almost killed you? Are there any particularly interesting times this happened?         Man, as a neckbeard, the most chugging I was ever able to do was a can of ginger ale in two minutes.       I would if I didn't have stuff to plug through social media.    Gaspar Noe, definitely.    I think the rest of the world except for the studio that lost the money has forgotten this movie already, but Jupiter Ascending could have done with a much lighter touch.

Do we still hate him and think he's guilty of unspeakable crimes?             So, is this the result of a land mine?    I've heard all about the guy because he financed Terry Gilliam's Brazil and such.       I have gone to restaurants, bars, clubs, theaters, parks, aquariums, plays, arcades, etc. alone.

                            Dogs are not our whole life, but they make our lives whole.                                       How come 90% of these articles never have pictures of the bones?     These things that look like cats, but they've got these long beak-y nose things.                                               One of my uncles is a Doctor. He works continuously 15 days a month, in which he works around 12 hours a day and has the other 15 days free. In that 15 days he spends time with his Wife and Children. This is how you need to adjust between your patients and family.      Find me a person that can watch Giant Douche vs. Turd Sandwich and not appreciate it.

Gluten free diets are meant for people with Coeliac disease, which affects somewhere between 1 in 100 to 1 in 170 people. It's just another fad diet that people thought was good for you, like the fat free craze back a couple decades ago. We're all still learning about nutrition. Edit: may want to include any type of diagnosed gluten intolerance too because my inbox is blowing up. I have no stat for that population, though.   	52
 Big Lebowski, Clerks 2, and Tommy Boy   That's kind of what I figured, but thought I would see if there is a possible designation.   After going to the Darlington race this past weekend, my friends and I started wondering if there was a difference between the 2 designations for a track.  Most of the tracks NASCAR goes to are noted as Speedways, but there are a few that are Raceways.  Or is it whatever the hell the track owner feels like calling it when they name it?   I'd say it affects me for some things.  I prefer to go to Lowe's, but am not against going to Home Depot.  Also, smaller items like certain food products will persuade me more if there's a picture of a driver on the product.  Depending on if I do or don't like them it will persuade my purchase.   I THINK EDDIE GOSSAGE IS TRYING TO COMPENSATE FOR SOMETHING WITH THAT NEW BIG HOSS TV!   BRAD AND A DIARY?  SO HE'S LIKE ANNE FRANK?   Yup.  Saying "Hey" back to this is usually a good response.  The other person doesn't actually care about how you are doing.  They are just using a different phrase to say hi.  Still kind of annoying though.   Kind of surprising Josh and Wise aren't each bigger than they are.   Nice catch!   Where I grew up in the U.S. you never even had to get out of your car to buy alcohol.  We had drive thru carry outs to get that stuff.   So you want ooey, gooey, rich and chewie inside.  Soft and golden crunchy flakey outside?   DENNY HAMLING USED THE EXCUSE OF METAL IN HIS EYE LAST WEEKEND BECAUSE HE WAS HAVING BAD FLASHBACKS OF WHAT HAPPENED LAST YEAR!!   I didn't see the pre race, so I don't know what song was played.  But is it possibly [this one](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGBLlFMn9Xc)?   In regards to this game, does anyone else have have friends that disagree with the order that the items are said?  As I grew up it was always Rock, Paper, Scissors.  But it seems anyone that is roughly 5 years younger or more order it Paper, Scissors, Rock.  I'm wondering why the change in the ordering.      SUMMER AND WINTER OLYMPICS APPARENTLY BOTH PLAY A ROLE NOW.   I've got Johnson, Edwards, Keselowski, and Allgaier as my current 4 starters on Yahoo.   OSU grad and current employee of theirs here!   Norm from Cheers!  Who didn't like him?   I think it's just really steep banking.   In 2004, 2005 and 2006 there were 5 drivers with a shot at the championship going into Homestead each year.  Unless your talking about pre chase years with multiple drivers having a shot.  That I'd have to look into a bit more to see.   You made me go back and check that actually.  Matt Kenseth most likely would have won.  He got 2nd and Jr. got 3rd at Homestead.  But you also have to take into consideration if Jr would have been eliminated after the first round with his engine failure at Chicago.   Agreeing with pretty much everyone else that this Chase format is a terrible idea.  But aside from the top 4 drivers going for the championship, are the remaining 12 that were eliminated from the chase essentially finishing in points in relation to where they are to the other 11 eliminated drivers at the Homestead race?  It says when someone is eliminated their total is reset to 2,000.  So does someone eliminated in the first round have their points reset to 2,000 after every 3rd chase race?    148   18   This sounds more like a first place problem than first world.   You need to get over the bad things in life.  Shit happens!   Thanks for the pictures.  Those seats don't look too bad.     Some friends and I are going to the Darlington race in April and will be ordering the tickets in the next week or so.  We are thinking of getting seats in the Pearson Tower section near the top.  So we'd be essentially near the entranace of pit road.  Any opinions on these seats or others?  This is the first time going to this track for all of us.   It's amazing how almost all of the stats end with a 5 or a 0 for the amounts.   Anyone else read the thank you in Mort's voice from Family Guy?   Yup, that's what I would say he is thinking of too.   Jimmie!   WHAT WHAT IN THE BUTT!   IT'S GOOD TO SEE THAT DALE SR. IS RETURNING TO THE CUP SERIES NEXT SEASON IN THE 3....OH WAIT.   I DON'T THINK WE NEED TO KNOW WHERE HIS OTHER IS AND WHAT IT'S DOING.   Way better than the actual commercial if you ask me!  Good job!   I completely agree!   I still think they should have reduced the number that gets inducted each year from 5 to 3.  NASCAR doesn't have the depth within the teams like other sports do in order to have that many people inducted each year.   Kyle Larson of course.   Aside from the lack of Dale Jarrett, why are all the countdown posts 1 day ahead of schedule?  Isn't today actually 89 days until Daytona 500?  Or am I counting wrong?   Shit, piss, fuck, cunt, cocksucker, mother fucker, and tits!   He has 4 top 5 finishes in the Sprint Cup series.  So there's that stat.  Don't think any were in the 93 car though.   Damn, if I lived in the Charlotte area I'd definitely have to stop by this.   Kind of odd that her middle name is the same as her first name though.   This is a pretty good idea.  But shouldn't today be 96 days until the Daytona 500?  Edit: Never mind.  I just saw your new post for day 96.   Twist, the spotter does speak English, but is British.   FINALLY THINGS ARE GOING TO RETURN TO NORMAL WITH OUR CHAMPION BEING JIMMIE JOHNSON AGAIN!   It gets me right in the feels.   When my friends make fun of NASCAR in regards to gas being wasted I usually bring up MLB teams.  They play 162 games a year and one of the teams has to travel to each game.  How much fuel does it use in a year for all of those teams to travel?   My brother bought one about 3 years ago at a garage sale. It's fun because you have to think back circa 1995 for what the answers actually are.   YOUR DRIVERS ALL SUCK.  ALL HAIL OUR OVERLORD JIMMIE JOHNSON!   YOU JUST WISH IT WOULD COME WITH SPRINKLES ON TOP!   People saying they got cheap gas.  Who the fuck cares?   And it takes a long time to count that high.  Just counting to [1 million](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremy_Harper) can take 3 months.   Thanks.  That's what I figured, but could never find the answer when searching.   So I know the scoring for rookie of the year is based entirely different from the points received for the championship.  The highest finishing rookie receives 10 points, second 9, then 8, etc.  On top of this there are points for attempting to qualify, getting a top 10, and a few other things.  Along with this, only the 17 top finishes per rookie are considered for their points.  My question is, out of those 17 finishes that are taken into account, how is a rookies points calculated if that race was a top 17 finish for them, but wasn't a top 17 for any other rookie?  Here's hypothetical example with Ricky and Danica.  Ricky gets 23rd place and Danica gets 25th.  Ricky has 17 other finishes higher than this race so this isn't taken into account for his rookie score.  But for Danica it is one of her top 17 finishes of the year.  Does this then only count for 9 points for Danica?  Of course with only 2 drivers it's not a big difference, but when there's a larger rookie field it would have more of an impact.

             Snakes and crocodiles are very efficient digesters - so we would probably look like them - no need to have teeth as the food can be swallowed whole, heads and jaws adopted to swallow objects bigger than the head, no need to be picky as we would eat nearly anything, then survive for months without food. Our social interactions would be somewhat different too, as we do use eating as a way to socialize.  	5
    Any opinion on Cruton, any issues worth taking into account? I'm considering buying Pixel LS as it is 700$ cheaper than MacBook Pro (EU here) for Android development so Ubuntu will be my primary OS.      Sure it can be, most likely a drawable inside it. But in this way I avoid most of the problems of for example, keeping size, and detecting text bottom line.  EDIT: you can even find a branch with such Drawable instead of 3 textviews on this repo.      Good try of avoiding a pop dialog of Superuser:  https://gist.github.com/stefanhoth/d52cd6cb2174bf6e395d      Actually they work in Telegram, and are pretty great (later on you can easily search by some hashtag).      Yes, it extracts its RemoteInput correctly, set text, and send it back but Hangouts does ignore that text. Just tested with Messenger - it works correctly.   So I have created sample project with it, and actually it is working.. for every other app except Hangouts (didn't test with other like Messenger). https://github.com/tajchert/NotificationResponse Probably they require some additional Id or use other way of getting RemoteInput.   What tool did you used to decompile? I used 3 different (dex2jar, some online one, and ShowJava app), each time with different results. ShowJava at leasts shows some method in BaseMirror class, that is Wearable related.  "static Mirroring$WearReplyAction a(NotificationSpec var0) {" but body is invisible due to some error.   Sorry, I found it later on (class) but there is still no code for extracting actions as you described. Here is my BaseMirror class: http://pastebin.com/WDLV5yap I have downloaded APK from Google Play (not extracted from the phone).   I have decompiled latest apk and can't find this class at all (neither "android.wearable.EXTENSIONS") any ideas where is it or what I'm doing wrong?   How about Android TV?   I'm aware of that - thus I wrote this is (very) small lib. It just save you work of setting up GoogleApiClient. So instead of those 80 lines of code you just wrote around 25. I found it useful in some of my project thus decided to make it a lib.

No other marketing, 0$ budget.   Is Yarn open sourced? Or how is this connected to "dev"?   Hi, sorry but I don't have knowladge to help you but did you shared your code? Would love to take a look how to write own simple keyboard and there are very few resources with samples.   Thank you! I didn't know that one already exists.   That lib is solving a problem that not many people are aware of - if you get a exception/crash on Android Wear device it **won't be reported in Google Play** - so you will get many 1 star reviews and no crash reports.      Do not forget to add license as well (for public ones at least).               Dev?   G+ source: https://plus.google.com/u/0/+TonySalinasLeDerpyDerp/posts      Is there better res of "yes we code"?

 I am just curious what part of the rant is racist. Because I think he is just ill informed and his mouth is too big for his head. He genuinely believes that there is a huge problem. He thinks the  country is the problem but not the race itself.   	1

 When I just turned thirteen I was diagnosed with Merycism, the involuntary regurgitation of food. Slowly I became worse and worse as I was handed off from doctor to doctor, all of them having no idea what to do. I lost 40 pounds from an already-healthy frame and became severely underweight. (Still am in fact.) All my hunger cues disappeared, my enjoyment of anything disappeared and my brain became anorexic before I ended up in the hospital with a feeding tube.  Don't feel better at all since then. I'm coming very close to treatment and I don't even know what the point is anymore. I used to have hobbies, things I was good at, now all I do is browse the Internet all day. I have two people I talk to on a regular basis, only one I know in real life, and the other one thinks I'm someone totally different from who I really am.  I'm also scared to go out in public because my body reacts like an anorexic's to weight gain and makes my stomach distorted (which is the reason I'm avoiding it right now even though I'm still dangerously low).  I'm tired of being sick. I want the old me back. He has to be in there somewhere.  I'm fourteen and I feel like I've gone through all the happiness in my life.  	1
    Check out /r/augusta   Don't listen to this guy. The city has a lot to offer.  In fact, just next week we are rolling out the red carpet for the entire world.  No other city in the state hosts an international-level sporting event like Augusta does.   There's really no basis for that assumption. It took thousands of people many years to make change, and against very powerful and stubborn forces in government and the private sector.  And even assuming you are right, millions of people would have suffered in the interim.   He was lying. It's really that simple.  These bills have cropped up all over the country, including _last year_ in Arizona. It's absurd to pretend to not know what they're about. He only backtracked when the shit hit the fan.   That's a damn easy thing to say on reddit in 2015.  "It would've worked out anyway."   You don't have the right to refuse service for _any_ reason (assuming you serve the public). "Pro-war" is a valid, legal reason but "black guy" isn't.   You claimed it is wrong for there to be legal penalties for not serving gays. Do you feel the same way about Jews, blacks, women, etc.? The Civil Rights Act of 1964 does _exactly_ that.  Whether you realize it or not, you as a business owner must abide by certain rules.   Ever refused someone because they're a Jew?  Edit: Downvote if you'd like but your argument is flawed. Since 1964, you cannot deny service to someone based on various criteria (e.g., race, religion).  What you're complaining about "losing" has been lost for 60 years. And we're better for it.   Well, not anymore.   And doctors and personal injury attorneys.   I think that's a false equivalence. Abortion is not clearly right or wrong like, say, refusing to serve someone because they are black.  If this restaurant said this about a black wedding, I don't think you would compare the outcry to abortion.   Is there a term for reverse-click bait? The actual story is so much worse than the headline implies.      One man's lazy is another man's efficient.   Thanks.   Under federal law, private businesses that are open to the public cannot discriminate based on certain criteria (e.g., race, sex, religion).  That is also why those who claim this isn't aimed at LGBTs are full of shit. Sexual orientation and gender identity DO NOT make the list mentioned above (but should). Therefore, the standard protected classes will not be affected by this law because the Civil Rights Act of 1964 trumps state law. This leaves one obvious gap: LGBTs.   So you oppose the Civil Rights Act? Why should we go back to the era of "Whites Only" businesses?   I'd LOVE to see this feature on Keep.   A canned email conveys a voter's opinion as well as a personal one does.  Requiring handwritten, personally-researched letters to our representatives is an excellent way to keep them free from voter input.  Why not let a trusted group do the grunt work? I support this practice (perhaps more so than the alternative because it allows average people to send meaningful input - it's no longer something only for the wealthy or extremely dedicated).   And we will fight it next year. And the next.  What we really need to do is defeat Senator McKoon.   Have you ever been to Indiana? I go every year for the race and see more Confederate battle flags over that one weekend than I do in Georgia (non-Atlanta) all year. I mean, at least Georgians can try to play the heritage card - just plain racist in Indiana.  Indiana is not some progressive beacon relative to Georgia.   It was on the verge of passing until Indiana's blew up in its face. It already cleared the House with flying colors and the governor said he would sign it if the cleared the Senate.  The far right has actually taken control of the Republican party, and gerrymandering means they don't give a shit. It's nuts.   And *no one* is buying their bullshit. That's what is interesting. Oftentimes the media will try to do a "both sides" thing but everyone knows it would be laughable to do here.   4/1?   And that's good, but it shouldn't be the end-all-be-all. If the market thinks something awful should happen (e.g., segregation based on race), it should be ignored.  The government should provide a floor to protect rights when the market fails to do so.   I feel like I missed a reddit joke about Gary...   Why didn't that work in the U.S. before the Civil Rights Act of 1964? Did the infallible free market fix racism and we just didn't realize it?   Right. It's all about _why_. You can't refuse to do business with someone _because_ they are black, Hindu, Mexican, female, Christian, Asian, Canadian, etc. (i.e., if the characteristic is a protected class).  Being a bigot is not a protected class.   Do you have a link to the new route? I couldn't find it.   Then get rid of limited liability - a gift from the state.   Our discrimination bill is still pending... but the passage of Indiana's may have killed it. So... thanks?   See, we tried that route (pre-1964) and the free market didn't do shit to stop racism.  So since we tried your way and it didn't work, and the Civil Rights Act *did* make things better, let's use the latter template for gay rights.   You have to put up with annoying. I have to put up with denial of services.  You poor thing.   Exactly. This issue is as clear as the race issue is. Those who think it's fine to deny services to someone simply because that someone is black are wrong. End of story.   A nondiscrimination amendment to the bill passed this afternoon!  Keep calling and emailing! Our voices *are* being heard!   Jeez dude. Got any thoughts on women, black people, and Jews?      There's a story that in the 60's the CEO of Coke told his friends that if the ticket sales for an event in honor of MLK didn't improve, Coke would consider leaving Atlanta.  I'm not sure if it's true but the general idea of companies helping advance civil rights is not new.   Put Harvey Milk on the $20.   /u/LouBond is right about the difference, but I can assure you, NASCAR has gay fans. Gay people have always been everywhere. Everyone else just didn't know it.   I go to the Indy 500 every year. I'm going to ask every business I go to whether they oppose the law. If they don't, they're sure as shit not getting my gay dollars.  No sitting on the sidelines.   The Augusta Chronicle opposes the bill and that says a LOT. The local paper's editorial board is extremely rightwing.    nothing is more attractive than a hot chick that doesn't act like a hot chick  No need to stick a gender on this. And although it's not universally attractive, there *is* something appealing about a person who has experienced both being unattractive and being attractive (physically; specifically, necessarily physically - unlike above... on purpose).   25  Not hating, just pointing that out. Her results are amazing.   I like the idea of asking every single business I go to if I am welcome.  Edit: I could make it a thing. I know someone with Glass. Governor Shithead is a homophobe, but are Indy fans? ... on second thought...   I go to the 500 every year. Have since I was 6 and I am 33 now (I missed one year while studying abroad).  What to do?   It depends on the level of scrutiny that "sexuality" will receive. The highest level of scrutiny makes most laws very hard to withstand constitutional challenges (e.g., race).   Fellow (Internet Smartass) is quite the distinguished position.   Bankruptcy... perhaps we should allow student loans incurred to attend a for-profit college to be discharged.  I like it.      The pending SCOTUS case is largely over an error in the drafting, not anything substantive.  And do you have a source for your job-killing claim?   That hearing was encouraging. The bill was definitely on the defensive.   It's interesting to watch rightwing groups attempt to be clever and try to "use" non-discrimination legislation against LGBT people. It only illustrates that they have absolutely no idea what the legislation is for.  It's not about playing "gotcha"; it's about protecting people from discrimination.      That's a weird thing with attorneys... It's seen as a sign of being a good attorney if your office looks like a paper bomb went off inside.   Jesus those guys are ripped.   That's the exact opposite of what the lobbyist who made the front page yesterday said (when asked what the average person should do to counteract money in politics).  Voting does matter.   I cried for days... I dunno why and don't care. Bangarang.   Excellent attorney.      Pbuh = Praise be upon him?  What's the history of that usage?   You think all the problems you have are someone else's fault.   What was it physically doing?      "Homosexualist" is a good hint.   They're trying to be "hip" and appeal to "youths".   They're trying to be "hip" and appeal to "youths".   A constitutional convention isn't an amendment.   A law professor put it to us this way: poor grammar will cause your reader to assume - correctly or incorrectly - that the content is poor as well.   Credit where credit is due. The paper is right on this legislation. Good job!      I don't like it either, but I respect it.  Why? Respecting an opinion that black people are inferior seems odd.   I guess I don't see the point. If it is legally the same legal concept, why two different terms?   How does changing the term accomplish that?   Is it not? My memory leans that way.   This will be interesting to watch.   That's a fish.   Marriage is not just a religious concept. Go look in any law library. There'll be a book or two titled "Marriage".  Switching the terms will literally change nothing and just appeases opponents of marriage equality.   A marriage is a "civil union", legally.  Your solution would just require every law book to swap "marriage" with "civil union", which is a waste of time and money for literally no change (except for appeasement of homophobes).   I wasn't implying that at all. Both conditions must be met for your argument to make sense. The state must have had Jim Crow laws *and* but for those laws, the businesses would not discriminate.  I am curious if that's something you have research to back up, of if it's just something you think.   Your claim is that Southern businesses were forced to discriminate against black people by the government, _and but for that force_, they wouldn't have?  That's a bold claim. Source?  Edit: Modified the emphasis.    They are also too ignorant of economics to realize that businesses who discriminate will likely be bankrupt by similar businesses who don't.  Not a big fan of history? Or did I miss where that happened and the Civil Rights Act of 1964 was just a precaution?   There are lot of legitimate issues with this bill. However, does anyone really think that a judge is going to allow a state RFRA as a defense for wife beating? To refuse Jews lodging in a hotel? Refuse interracial couples?  You left out one group that does not have federal protections (from legislation such as this): homosexuals. Is the possibility of a judge ruling against a homosexual as absurd as you think your other examples are?  Overall, religious freedom is protected by the First Amendment. I don't see what lack of religious freedom this bill is trying to address. It's just hard to believe the uptick in this sort of legislation has _nothing_ to do with the pending marriage lawsuit in the SCOTUS. Doesn't pass the smell test.   Haha, no. But I have known him for many years (as acquaintances, not close friends).    If it is your business you should be able to do what you want. If people don't like it then your business closes. Yay capitalism. Government has no need to interfere.  Haha, right. That's how history played out. /s   Look, buddy. Don't get all mad at me for not fully understanding your position when you jumped down my throat for asking what it was. Good lord... lay off the coffee or something.  You do not support the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (at least to the extent that it requires public businesses to not discriminate based on race). Is that correct?   I had heard of some churches getting sued for not solemnizing weddings.  Do you know from where? That sounds like something that would pop up on a Facebook feed from "that uncle".   Why so hostile? I've simply asked you two questions (in a respectful manner).  You agree that businesses should be required to serve black people despite their religious objections. Why do you have a different opinion regarding homosexuality?   So your answer to my question is "yes"?   Do you think a business should be able to refuse service to black people because the owner's religion says that blacks are inferior?   At least Wal-Mart is increasing their minimum wage. The jobs are still low paying but not as low as they could be.      I haven't worked with him but know him personally. He has a passion for Augusta. Coupled with his youth, I think he is what Augusta needs.   That top is fucking hot.   Yeah.   That seems like a viable argument to me.   The election for the commissioner of District 7 is this Tuesday. Please vote! Turn out will be low so your vote will have a lot of weight.  For what its worth, I'm voting for Frantom. He's dedicated, committed to Augusta, and has a good head on his shoulders.   01/00  Edit: January 0, 2015; 2015-01-00. We can make this work.   This look like walking in dreams feels.   So, as everyone suspects, it's the gays who get fucked.  Edit: And not to mention, it would take a lawsuit to resolve the issue definitively. Prior to that, the lack of clarity would cause real harm as warned.   C?  If B and C wore the same color, D would know that his hat is the other color. So if D remains silent after 10 minutes, C knows that his hat is not the same color as B. As C knows that B's hat is white, C's hat must be black.   Is that where it cuts through the mountains prior to reaching the Black Sea?   16 year old test_subject937 rejoices!  The timing is funny. It used to be where the new CookOut is going in on Washington Road. Nothing has been successful since Fazoli's left, but I'm sure CookOut will be.  The Curse of Fazoli's is finally about to be lifted and they're coming back!    it is not so on its own under Federal Law unless the legislature also supports it with their own actions/resolutions/laws.  This is not true of all executive agreements. If the executive agreement was entered into by the President pursuant to his enumerated or inherent constitutional authority, it has the force of federal law (and will supersede conflicting federal law pursuant to the "Last in Time" rule).    Executive Agreements cannot have the force of Federal Law unless approved in the Senate by another, separate resolution.   Wrong. That is just wrong. I have already cited _the Supreme Court of the United States_ to prove you are wrong. Care to cite a case in opposition?   Um, no. You're the one making this a partisan issue. I am simply explaining how the legal process works (regardless of what political party may be in charge).   What? Did you read what I wrote? Government has a monopoly on violence, and all legal orders (and therefore our entire system of law) ultimately rest upon the threat of force to comply.  That's why if you ignore a civil judgment, the party you lost to will show up at your house with a sheriff and enforce the judgment by taking your property. If this _wasn't_ the case, judicial orders and the rule of law would be meaningless.   I was referring more to the end game, legally (assuming the Kochs can be compelled to testify):  Congress subpoenas, Kochs fight them, Kochs lose, Kochs refuse to comply, U.S. Marshalls show up with guns to drag them into court. If they "fight back" against the marshalls by hiring mercenaries or something crazy, they will ultimately lose because tanks.   That sole executive agreements cannot have the force of federal law, or overrule Congress. If the subject matter is the prerogative of the President, they can (and I have already provided a source for this).  Between you, a nonlawyer, and the Supreme Court, I'll go with the latter...   You're just moving the goal posts now.  You originally quite clearly said that executive agreements cannot have the force of federal law (i.e., "No. They. Do. Not"). I provided specific case law from the Supreme Court showing that you are wrong.  You're trying to back peddle now by saying "most" have congressional input. That wasn't your original claim at all.  You're also now admitting you're not an expert, which I take to mean you have no legal training. I do, including studying international law in the U.S. and abroad. You're understanding of the law here is simply wrong.  Edit: And for crying out loud... the paragraph immediately before the first you cited contradicts your point. Don't selectively quote, please.   Seriously, /u/Silidistani, quit repeating incorrect information.  You have so far failed to respond to the congressional report (with case and statutory citations) I have sprinkled all over this thread. Your understanding of the law in this field is not complete - surface at best.   No, he actually isn't. Please see the congressional source I have posted repeatedly. His sources are Wikipedia and ehow.  Edit: Does that guy have a law degree?

Big "t" Treaties are pursuant to the Treaty Cause; small "t" treaties aren't. That is the only meaningful difference.  International law makes no distinction between the two; only U.S. law does. A U.S. President signing a sole executive agreement pursuant to his authority as C-in-C is no less a treaty than one ratified by the Senate.  And, by the way, a statute is only as good so long as the sitting Congress wishes it to be (generally). It is no surprise that lawmaking is dependent upon lawmakers.   [Incorrect](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t source=web rct=j ei=IlMCVbWoBc32gwTy6IPwBw url=http://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/RL32528.pdf ved=0CDAQFjAG usg=AFQjCNE_0ryx2ClehZ7q_isyd4Gx6BWBxA sig2=sgtAFQ3TkUwDbnEX478lCw) [PDF download]   Sure.

That is a congressional report with case citations, not an ehow page. There are sections that address each of your points, I think.  Edit: Here's the footnote refuting your claim that sole executive agreements cannot have the force of federal law (in italics):  Executive agreements have been held to be inferior to conflicting federal law when the agreement concerns matters  expressly within the constitutional authority of Congress. See, e.g., United States v. Guy W. Capps, Inc., 204 F.2d 655  (4th Cir. 1953) (finding that executive agreement contravening provisions of import statute was unenforceable);  RESTATEMENT, supra footnote 1, 115 reporters n.5. *However, an executive agreement may trump pre-existing federal law if it concerns an enumerated or inherent executive power under the Constitution, or if Congress has historically  acquiesced to the President entering agreements in the relevant area.* See Pink, 315 U.S. at 230 ([a]ll Constitutional  acts of power, whether in the executive or in the judicial department, have as much legal validity and obligation as if  they proceeded from the legislature) (quoting The Federalist No. 64 (John Jay)); Dames   Moore, 453 U.S. at 654  (upholding sole executive agreement concerning the handling of Iranian assets in the United States, despite the  existence of a potentially conflicting statute, given Congresss historical acquiescence to these types of agreements).  In other words, if it is a constitutional prerogative of the President, his signature alone can be binding. And you don't get much more Presidential than foreign policy.   Hooray!, internet stranger!   Yep. As Frank Underwood said: "You may have all the money, but I have all the men with guns."   Yes they are. And, yes, Congress can override some with legislation (overriding a veto if necessary).  	121
 Dog is lucky he didn't flush...   Fallout 3 was my first introduction into RPGs, and I loved it. Open world, play your own style at your pace. I had just been a purely FPS player prior to that, but now I'm broadening my genre horizons...   As a long-time lurker, I was just here to browse content and chuckle at witty comments.

Damn it. Beat me to it...   Gotcha. So, by not vaccinating, you not only put yourself at risk, but everyone around you, and you do all of this for a weak "maybe" of a risk.  Doesn't seem worth it at all.   Yes, I've seen many references to mercury being potentially implicated in this, so you make a good point.   Thanks! Just did :)   My parents are anti-vaccinations, and I've been trying to educate myself on the matter so that I could address and potentially counter their concerns knowledgeably.  I know Reddit is quite pro-vaccine, and I hear all the time about the flawed and debunked autism-vaccine study. I watch Penn and Teller's Bullshit episode on vaccines, and I see people "poo-poo" any casual connection between vaccines and autism.  But then I come across a site like [this](http://adventuresinautism.blogspot.com/2007/06/no-evidence-of-any-link.html), and I become confused. It appears to be heavily cited, with over 60 papers and studies that present a connection between various types of vaccines and ADS (austism spectrum disorder).  There seems to be misinformation on this topic everywhere, and it can get a little overwhelming. Reddit, can you help me sort out fact from fiction, speculation from science?  *EDIT* Whoops, forgot to include link    This is great, thank you! I'm not one to take a blogger or even a study at face value, but I sometimes have a difficult time taking apart the research process like you did.  And those are great resources, I'll definitely be bookmarking those for thorough reading :)   I understand, but even if we assume that one is completely safe (which isn't the case) that's only a single vaccine. There are studies linking autism to the Hepatitis B Vaccination, for example.  I guess I'm just wondering if vaccination simply becomes a question of risk tolerance? "Am I okay with with the rare but possible side effects of this vaccination?"   Okay, so would you agree it's a case then of risk assessment? Not all vaccines are for potentially fatal diseases.      "If you visit a link on one computer, itll show up purple across your other computers."  Will this also be the case for mobile apps? This would greatly improve the efficiency of my toilet based reddit browsing.   I hope it's mandated to use these new server names in conversation as well.  "Oh shit, Titty-Sprinkles is down again"   Really? Where are you getting that from?

 You're right, there absolutely are flaws in the system and the US desperately needs a better health care system but I don't believe for a moment this is the right fix.  Regardless of how we personally disagree, there's no doubt people have had their insurance canceled and their doctors don't take ACA, and certainly a lot of people like me who simply cannot afford it. People like myself aren't taking to the Internet to lie about our experiences. I was laid off late last year because the company I worked for was failing and couldn't afford my salary, I got on unemployment and still had to pay almost $700 in penalties because of ACA. Passing it hasn't helped me one bit.   It's great that you've had a positive experience with ACA, but that doesn't negate the negative experiences that others are having.  I couldn't afford insurance then, and I can't afford it now. I took the hit on my taxes cause it was much cheaper than paying just a few months worth of coverage. Just because you can say you've never seen it happen doesn't mean it's not happening. I haven't personally seen the annexation of Crimea, I've never held a billion dollars, I don't know anyone who's won the lottery, but all of those exist, can happen or have happened.   The other side of it is the affect it's having on doctors. My uncle is a doctor with his own pratice, and the ACA is killing him financially. It's taking months to get reimbursement from an ACA plan, which means he's basically working for free and doesn't have any money to cover overhead like everyday operations costs.   Congrats, that's so awesome!! I can't wait to get to that point, too. How long have you been on keto?   "Fuck it, I'm coming home" well, that's not very encouraging!   That's awesome, great job!! I hope I can get to that point one day.    Thank you so much!    Thank you!! It must be very difficult traveling that much and sticking to Keto. How do you manage it?   It's actually a relief to read this. I'm on day 2 and I know I'm not going to see weight loss *yet*, but I'm fearful of being the rare person to not lose any. Reading all the success stories can almost seem too good to be true, so it's nice to know that if one falters, it's worthwhile to stick with it. Thank you for sharing your experience!!    Its day two on Keto. My husband and I are traveling a bit today, so the only decent road lunch option was McDonald's. I got a bacon cheeseburger wrapped in lettuce instead of a bun (no side), and my husband got a large fry with his meal.  The thing is, potatoes are my *obsession.* Fries, tots, hashbrowns, baked, scalloped...you name, I would destroy it.  He ate not even half of the box, and usually I'd finish them off after eating my own large fry, but today? Today I ignored everything in my body that screamed FINISH HIM in a Mortal Combat voice. I balled up my trash, stuffed it in the fry box and threw it all out. I'm so stupidly proud of myself. Self - restraint is not one of my strengths by any stretch of the imagination, but maybe I can do this after all!!  EDIT: Goodness, I love this community. Every time I post here I get so much encouragement, support, and direction. Thank you, you guys rock :)   True but that's a totally different situation. I will gladly give help to someone, anyone in need. But not someone asking for help because "they get X, I should get Y."   Sorry, no magic here!! I made them at home, using nutritiondata.com for the nutritional content, but I put into MPF that I used *all* 2 pounds in 1 taco, then x how many tacos I ate. I feel like such a dope! I fixed it and I'm still over for the day because I had steak for lunch, but it's *so much closer!*   I figured it out!! I did some meal prepping and ate some of that for dinner. I accidentally included *all* of the ground beef I used instead of just what I ate tonight.    Thank you! I certainly hope you're right, cause if this keeps happening I could easily see myself getting frustrated and giving up.   That makes me feel way better, there's no way I ate a whole pound of meat in those tacos. I'll look into it and see where I can find the mistake, and I'll be vigilant of weighing everything instead of relying on food I search for on MPF's database.   I'm not using a scale yet, it will be in tomorrow. I'm gonna crunch some more numbers and see what's up cause MPF is saying the tacos alone were 136g. I thought it sounded wrong when I saw the amount of calories they supposedly are, especially because I used lettuce shells.   Again, thank you! I ordered a scale, it'll be in tomorrow. I did seriously over do it on meat today. I had steak, seared shrimp then lettuce-shelled tacos. This was definitely a big lesson, I won't let this happen again.  	16

But Horner actually did something really beautiful. James Horner's team had actually brought Fuqua the completed written score for The Magnificent Seven. You can actually hear in the interview that Fuqua was really touched by Horner's gesture because he didn't do it for money. He just did it because he loved the script.   It's incredibly touching to hear these stories, especially from Fuqua who you can hear get choked up about it, and hopefully we'll be able to hear Horner's final score.

Once, a friend told me about a situation he observed in which a white customer at a grocery store dropped some change into the palm of a black clerk while paying for his food. The black clerk looked the customer straight in the eyes and said, loudly enough for people nearby to hear, "it doesn't rub off, you know."  The black clerk felt put down because she felt that the white customer was avoiding touching her because of her race. That may have even been true, but maybe he was a germophobe and treated everyone that way, or maybe he didn't like touching other people, or maybe he was just being careless because his mind was on other things. We don't know.  The thing is, the customer had no options. He couldn't stand up and say, "excuse me, everyone who just saw that? Could I have your attention? I just want to let everyone know that I'm not a racist," because that would make him look even more like a racist.  In this way, people who are members of groups that are subject to prejudice have a special power to try and convict people in the court of public opinion. They may be sensitive or insecure in ways that are not readily apparent, and there are no defenses available to people who are perceived as members of dominant, majority, or privileged groups.  This happens all the time. Look at male students who have been expelled from universities due to rape allegations without evidence (or even contrary to evidence) for example.  Because society works this way, it can be more dangerous for people who are perceived as privileged to interact with people who are perceived as unprivileged, so I would say that OP has successfully avoided a negative result in what can be a dicey situation.  https://np.reddit.com/r/AdviceAnimals/comments/3dnfrs/i_struck_the_human_lottery/ct6wsik   If you think that Arab Muslims in Europe are going to continue on old Latin, Germanic, or Celtic values, think again.

I never usually see this drama without Robotics man in there. But here he is again. It's like a moth to flames.  I love when negative posts get gilded. The salt comes out.   Chipolte is great, but the one thing I never got is the whole "it'll ruin your asshole" thing. I never took any massive shits, but it's a meme whenever Chipolte comes up.    I usually ask for half of the rice and double up on the meats. Sometimes I just want a burrito and there's something satisfying about the fact that their ingredients are pretty fresh, you can watch them grill all that shit too, and it all just tastes really good. The guac is pretty fucking stellar. Usually, I just go for guacamole and dip.   Lol. Google is so passe. I use this cool thing you've probably never heard of called the phone book. All the cool kids are using one.   They've internalized memes. They're meme masters.   ad hoc pork bone chop hoc of beef.   Classic Ad Hom. Classic.    Gillette Razor.

No Jew Not.   *snaps fingers vigorously    I thought Redditors shit the bed on the Ellen Pao debacle and the guys who run Reddit are trying to out do them by eating a jar of stool softener before shitting the bed.   The admins really need training in dealing with customer service. They act like they're part of the rabble.    It's going to blow up in his face. Once the moderators see how unmanageable trolls are and they find that they can't actually get rid of them, they're going to either shut down the subs or leave.   They do it for free and Huffman is literally out there saying, "I'd like to make your jobs harder because I want to read dipshit comments.

The biggest problem is that he assumes Reddit is filled with inherently good people willing to bring good discussion to the table. Boy, is he really barking up the wrong tree.   I'm pretty sure Steve Huffman is a plant from Facebook to destroy Reddit.            He probably would have been better as the replacement for the Daily Show or maybe a Bill Mahar type round table.   God, it's like the worst of Christopher Nolan's scripts just up and came to life and re-arranged themselves into a Frankenstein Dylan Thomas knock-off.   Buzzfeed made 100 million last year. Reddit's profit? Just about 8 mill.

When I first copied it, he didn't have any line breaks. That's in the archived version. I like the way it is now. It preserves the "original intent."   It's the one from Star Trek. I'm having a hard time believing anyone in KiA has a good sense of history anyhow.   bait shop?   Proving my point, how does this prove in any way shape or form that I am a man baby? What even is a man baby? Someone who wears a diaper on Tuesday nights? Someone who is 27 and watches adventure time while high? Someone who whines a lot ("there are not enough hours in the day")? Ignorant how? Do you claim to have a fair and unbiased viewpoint of both sides? I personally know LGBT people have a shit time, T and B especially (I don't we should place value on how bad certain individuals have it, more of the whole whining about life deal) but we are gradually getting better and the best thing for that is positivity, not negativity and captious behavior. I am not gonna sit and let people tell me that we are getting worse or that there is nothing we can do except point out flaws.  This is the best thing I've read today.    If you can't separate someone's actions from their identity and then have the gall to claim any criticism is harassment then you are a miserable excuse for a rational person. Laurlai was the reason this sub was created, because social justice hypocrites were drawing to much hate for lgbt folk with their rhetoric. when your claim to being trans gendered, bi, or homosexual is because of make believe genders or because you want to gain victim status for immunity it's despicable. These people remove all agency from women, telling them that they are helpless without feminism and that they can't be free to express their sexuality (in most cases referring to heterosexuality) without indirectly harming others. They believe that all their own problems stem from society and they have zero self awareness. It is possible that Anti GG's and third parties have posed as gg'ers to stir shit, and there are bad apples among the gg'ers that may have done the same, nobody knows. But GG's mission is to end the sexist, bigotted, and perverse overcompensation for historical discrimination that society has already deemed despicable and was moving away from that is perpetuated by SJW types. The racism towards white people that gets ignored because somehow somewhere it was decided that institutional racism = racism and that apparently there never was a society that enslaved white people (ignoring thousands of years of history, for example the Khan dynasty, germanic peoples, Moors, Celts, Greeks, fuck just about everyone has been enslaved or enslaved someone else). It also claims that preferences tacitly belie discrimantion no matter what (even if sometimes it may be that way you can't really prove that and it does not cause significant harm) and that any figure couldn't possible be criticized for any reason besides racism/phobia/sexism. The struggles of victims are stolen for the sake of pointing out how evil society is. Their irrational claims draws negative attention and encourages those that had some small amount of sexism/homophobia/etc. to justify it ("oh that crazy femnazi dyke bitch trying to tell me what to do lol" or any other sort of reaction it might cause). I personally know teens my age that will say sexist shit just to rile up our local hoard of self loathing teenage girls and people think it is hilarious. This bullshit makes a mockery of all feminism/rights movements and prevents focus on actual issues. Doxxing and harassing those who defy you're narrative is a despicable course of action. And if you think my rebuttal is harassment, you're a fucking joke and lack emotional maturity. Hurt feelings are not grounds for outcry. I will not stand for perverted identity politics that will make a world where Frozen is racist, gay men are sexist, sex is rape, any feeling of regret is rape, sex involving two intoxicated members of opposite sex puts that man in prison, women who rape are celebrated or go unpunished, living unhealthy is praised, and where criticism is tantamount to violence. I do not want draconian censorship of humor and insults that are even remotely offensive, that would be a rather joyless world. 1984 was a warning but social justice hypocrites treat it like a manual for running the world. Edit: to the people who downvoted, does that really make me wrong? that you disagree? That the number is proof? Care to defend yourselves? No? That's right, because almost everything you got is illogical or a conclusion drawn from bias without being well informed.  https://np.reddit.com/r/ainbow/comments/3dl2hg/gawker_aids_in_the_blackmailing_and_outing_of_a/ct6azle  Extra nugget:   They criticizing a movement that wants to eliminate disagreement and dissent that doesn't adhere to their beliefs. Orwell specifically decried this. I don't know how you have so massively misunderstood his views on societal structure. He is against oppressive practices that he clearly defined. Reactionary is a poor choice to describe GG. I could say all SJW's are reactionary, they see something they decide is not right and let everyone know. Face it, we're both mud rakers here. Fuck stains doesn't leave me with any constructive feedback so I'll move on. The sjw movement absolutely has elements of 1984, doublethink, careful scrutiny of all media for ideas that don't conform, and the desire for indoctrination.  One last one:  Proving my point, how does this prove in any way shape or form that I am a man baby? What even is a man baby? Someone who wears a diaper on Tuesday nights? Someone who is 27 and watches adventure time while high? Someone who whines a lot ("there are not enough hours in the day")? Ignorant how? Do you claim to have a fair and unbiased viewpoint of both sides? I personally know LGBT people have a shit time, T and B especially (I don't we should place value on how bad certain individuals have it, more of the whole whining about life deal) but we are gradually getting better and the best thing for that is positivity, not negativity and captious behavior. I am not gonna sit and let people tell me that we are getting worse or that there is nothing we can do except point out flaws.  It's a gift that keeps on giving:  Is politics being in games necessary? It happens in other mediums sure, but not nearly to the degree that you would like for games. Why are violent games a problem? The install base of violent video games compared to those who have committed violence in the name of games is monstrous. They aren't even comparable.  Our society for milennia has been extremely sex negative, and even your side will decry "slut shamers" Sexuality is a part of who we are and lots of innocuous things can and have been sexualized. Do you think the new Miguel album is grossly sexualized? He writes about his heterosexuality in an overt way that's at times self loathing, indulgent, and identifies his desires. I wouldn't expect someone who doesn't analyze music to immediately get it. Wildheart is a fantastic album, critically acclaimed and everything. Why focus overtly on video games/tv/movies? Mad Max wasn't a political statement, it was just good writing. You are confusing politics with being socially conscious. Content creators are free to express political beliefs but their content must also be more than a platform for their beliefs. Sunset comes to mind, it wasn't a game, but I will give the premise credit. It could have been a short film, which could have been well received but it tried to be a game for "real gamers" that lacked gameplay.   So he made a community about people being "bigots" toward racists and those people are the *real* bigots?  http://i.imgur.com/Vdtzy58.gif   KING JAMES HAS ARRIVED.   He seems more like a wet noodle.    I'm waiting for Yishan to infiltrate Reddit from the inside once again. Yishan gets hired as a "consultant" and three months down will frame Steve Huffman by putting nude photos of dogs having sex with plushie dolls and then take over the CEO position and nuke this site from the sky while Back in the Saddle plays.  I don't think Steve Huffman is as strong a leader to get Reddit monetized and bring in users. And he's too much of a wet noodle to decide on what to ban. Even his purge picks were like, "Yeah, okay. This one is obvious, but this one will be over there, I gueeeess."   The URL is hilarious by the way.  **chuck-johnson-is-a-massive-baby-who-doesnt-know-how-to-read-service-agreements**   Stenley kubrcik died for our memes.   Limn is trying to stile our creation of memes. its in the constitution that we have freedom of memes.   I was briefly subbed to /r/MadMaxGem. Made a post, some comments, etc. And unsubbed within a week. The MoviesCirclejerk guys were choking out any discussion. They commented on nearly everything people said to mock and demean. **It seemed to be only two or three** really dedicated trolls, but christ, what a shitshow.   Dredd wasn't even on the list. What the fuck is this amateur hour?    I recently graduated and wrote my thesis paper on cult films. My actual paper, however, wasn't up to my personal par because I was typing it in a drugged stupor from a hospital bed in order to graduate on time, so I figured I'd try and not waste months of research and put my knowledge to good use! Let me know if you like this, because I have 8000 more things to say (ex: the history of cult, what defines "cult status", cult vs. cool, the new rules of cult in the internet age, **why I hate Quentin Tarantino,** etc.), or I could talk about specific films, too.  EDGY      I hope we get to see that guys surgically larger dick or this money will have been for nothing.    Apparently, mocking individuals is only reserved for bon vivants of the highest caliber over at Kotaku in Action. No one can understand the deep wells of meaning behind their famed sense of dignity.   You posted a Deadline article saying that this is empirical evidence that he's doing something akin to throwing out the first draft.  Jon Spaihts is writing Doctor Strange.  That's your statement saying he's writing it, not "re-writing" it. Either way, I don't know what the fuck we're talking about. Three guys have put in work on the screenplay and that's that.     The first draft of the Doctor Strange script was penned by Thomas Dean Donnelly and Joshua Oppenheimer.  Exactly, he's rewriting it. This isn't proof that he's throwing out the entire first draft.    We don't actually know what he's doing or whether he'll be keeping material from Donelly and Oppenheimer. You really can't empirically say that you know he'll be throwing away their entire work.    Not by much. A lot of his scenes were left in. The major changes by Lindelof and Scott were done by the studio; No Xenomorphs, the pod sequence was changed, the ending was a little more open, and the love making sequence doesn't end with a xenomorph popping out.   The only change I think would have made the film better was if David did follow through with believing he was an heir to the engineers and not having the black goo sequence. Other than that, his delusions are a little unexplained. The scene that was removed about Shaw and David with the facehugger had the potential to be extremely corny.    So are Thomas Dean Donelly and Joshua Oppenheimer.    Jon Spaihts  You're gonna have a hard time convincing me that the same writers as Dylan Dog: Dead of Night and Conan the Barbarian (Remake) and the writer of The Darkest Hour and one half of the team that wrote Prometheus is not some sort of unholy alliance made in hell.    r u a bettr fathr now?   [Here's the interview](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/02/movies/anthony-and-joe-russo-on-captain-america-winter-soldier.html?_r=0)  They were a bit shocked he went there.   Can't wait for another movie about Rosemary Dewitt doing Rosemary Dewitt things.    James Vanderbilt also wrote the fantastic satire cum 80's wet dream action movie White House Down.    "Spider Man...listen right cause he's the great part...tries to kill his boss at the Daily Bugle, but he doesn't know how...stop me if you've heard this one *big grin* okaydon'tstopmeifyou'veheardthisone...but then he's friends with Harry Osborne who ALSO works at the Daily Bugle. And together they try to kill their boss in wacky ways. Wahoo how'd ya like it!?"  "Get out of here, Mr. Trump."   My favorite question lobbed at the Russo brothers was during the press tour for The Winter Solider and Brooks Barnes straight up said, "Why should we forgive you for You, Me and Dupree?"   The same writers as Dylan Dog: Dead of Night and Conan the Barbarian (Remake) are writing Doctor Strange. Basically Marvel struck out twice.   John Sayles apparently is a great writer because his ideas survived long enough to get into Jurassic World. Get him.    All of those movies. Instant classics. They belong in the Criterion Collection. Each one.   Except for Batman V Superman. Then it's okay. And Suicide Squad. I'm willing to be advertised to about suicide Squad. And Doctor Strange I want Doctor Strange ads all over my body.    Somewhat off-topic, but where does the idea that Girls is somehow an accurate portrayal of the millennial generation come from?  Because Lena Dunham proclaimed on the first episode that she's a "voice of a generation" and everyone just went with it. It speaks to some sub section of "millennials" who find that self destructive attitude much like their own.   At least it was better written than the potential Donald Trump memoir: "I'm better than you. You know it and you're a dummy. Look at my Billions. TEN BILLION DOLLARS"   I don't understand his complaint either.  "Oh, yoooooooou hippies. If you're gonna come here then just stand at the city limits and proclaim your guilt before entering this dead city. You should feel bad from taking it away from honest people."  From all the news out of Detroit, it sounds like the honest people either died, were killed, or up and left. Why the fuck does anyone need to answer to that guy? Living in a city isn't a badge of honor. He's not Joseph Mitchell, patron saint of the working class, either.  But this line was priceless:  Thats the rub. Thats what gets me, because weve lived here in Detroit all this time and we know how to get along here.  Not long enough to save that city from bankruptcy apparently.    I'm fucking loving this Highline shit they got there. The Huffington Post is an un-navigable mess. It's nice they just decided to clean it up and put all the good shit somewhere else.                Uhhh..the headline on NY Times front page was the shooters life was ["Short and Bitter."](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/17/us/chattanooga-shooting-suspect-was-ordinary-boy-neighbors-recall.html?hp action=click pgtype=Homepage module=b-lede-package-region region=top-news WT.nav=top-news)   So this is the excuse for bad costume design?    Rights to license the music probably cost them the rest.    Reddit MD is on the case. lol. It's just like how Cringe always tries to diagnose that one kid from the Minecon 2013 video as autistic.   "So that's it, huh? We're just some kind of Guardians of the Galaxy tribute band." - Will Smith   Yishan: The internet's greatest hype man.    I've seen pictures of the look they're going for, but honestly I wish some costume designer went, "Are we really going to build an action movie around sexy vampire costumes?"  The Days of Future Past tactical costumes were much better. The thing here is that it just doesn't make Psylocke look very intimidating.    This was on /r/videos. Someone probably thought this would make it in this sub. Ya'll are upvoting it.    No, he's not my Jonas. He's Joe Jonas.   Isn't this indicative of all the X-Men movies starting with First Class? They have the production values of a TV show along side giant CGI million dollar spectacle. I'm not even buying Olivia Munn's costume. It just looks like "Sexy Vampire" from a Halloween outlet.    He is. Right now he's the only credited writer on the project.    Resurrection was fun. Also, Ron Perlman.   It used to get play all the time on Cartoon Network. Then CN became the network of adult stoners and they moved all the Chuck Jones-Hannah Barbera stuff to Boomerang.   What about all them trigger warnings for spider posts?

A degree of self-awareness would go a long way for those people.   Steve Huffman is a wet noodle confirmed.    Everyone died for this.

[Coontown is rejoicing](http://gawker.com/reddits-most-racist-community-rejoices-as-new-ceo-says-1718353537)   Wow, does that guy have proof or did he shit that one out because he knows the inner workings of the upvote system?   Reading the "reclassified" terms was a pussy move. God, such a fucking disappointment. And the media is gonna kick him in the tits about it till he breaks too.     People are really desperate to keep ShitRedditSyas and really desperate to keep Coontown. I'm waiting for Yishan to go fucking ham in the thread.   It's copy pasta. It was on Best of Outrage Culture. He's looking for gold.   [The SRS question has been asked. It's fucking long.](https://np.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/3djjxw/lets_talk_content_ama/ct5qubn)  Apparently, even SRS can't escape reclassification. IT MUST BE BANNED!!!!   I'm seeing a lot of Conservatives and Republicans fearing for their lives. I think people here either don't know how to read English or don't understand that shitty subs are shitty subs. Either way. CT not getting the boot is fuckinf shitty.   Rapingwomen is done for.   Same shit happens in Anime.    It looks like a costume from Star Trek: TNG   I hope the first guy gets as many questions as Lloyd Kaufman.    I NEED A HERO!   Looks like that prison could have used an El Chaporone.    They're a Redditor. You're a Redditor. I'm a Redditor. No where did I say he's wrong in calling out the hypocrisy. I would like for you to point out where I said, "He is wrong you can exclude opinions based on the color of skin."  I just think that it's funny that when given an opportunity to hear from the conservative element of Reddit, they do the same thing based on gender and no one calls them out.     Proof that sometimes people send nasty PMs during a brigade? I have plenty, but none from Circlebroke. As far as I know, they've never brigaded me. I have plenty from SRD, SRS, and other circlejerk subs. Shit, I was even brigaded by /r/videos[1] once.  He said it, but then provided no proof? Am I going crazy? Has Reddit gone from "we're all science savants" to "I have proof which I cannot show at this time for it is privileged information."   I didn't say it was. I just think it's a weird double standard.   That score by Edward Shearmur is a 100 percent classic in my book. Perfect. It's a shame these guys didn't get a chance to work again.   A fake, made up thing Fox news once got upset about because a young adult author wrote about a bunch of teen girls giving guys blowjobs with different color lipsticks. Hence, rainbow. Roy G. Biv was a lucky guy.   19 sucked. I was poor, lonely and had a shit flip phone. Some of these dudes around here seem like they want to go back as they are now because they think they'll be the coolest shit on campus.   I sold blowjobs in high school, so I take pride in knowing it's me :) That's a prostitute. A slut would do it for free.  I enjoy that it rhymed.    I hope this is satire, but I've been in True Reddit for a while. They have a large contingent of gamergater, "I don't read articles," "just talking common sense" Bill Burr types. So they know their audience.   you do realize what you are saying right? You are dismissing someone's opinion based on (your own perceived idea) of what their skin color is. It's baffling to me that you seem to be literally unable of hearing someone's opinion, solely because of the color of their skin.  It's maybe baffling, but then again I read r/videos comments [where they do shit like this](https://np.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/3dcedn/some_local_kids_in_my_town_recently_shot_and/ct44gcd). It's not like Redditors don't do it if they hear one of those infamous buzzwords.    Dear suckerberg,  Penis  Love, Pepe    Who wants to bet a repost of the futurama math formula for time travel repost is not far behind?   And the VHS Rewinder.   It's a weird story, but probably because everyone would think it's promoting some form of entertainment imperialism and colonialism.    They let Floyd Mayweather handle the AMA today. He brought May showers of grammatical errors.    Reddit didn't decide to attempt to pretend like they run a company before.   After 10 years, Alexis and Huffman realize that people who pay money expect the guys running a company to work for a living.   Like Karmanaut need the ego boost to tell people on a first date, "You know guys. I brought down Reddit."   She looks like Zooey Deschanel. Like it's reeeeeally close match.   Most of this video is comprised of exactly the kind of hipster girls I expected to see.    He's not my Jonas. Maybe he's someone elses Jonas.   Either those comments are real or Marvel has a very dedicated group of PR professionals.     What? No it wasn't and no they didn't. The first Transformers movie is literally the only movie I've ever walked out of.   Congratulations on this anecdotal evidence. Roger Ebert gave it [3 out of 4 stars](http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/transformers-2007). But please, rant on.  You know what? I'm just going to tell myself that you're being sarcastic so I can get some sleep tonight.  Do you always lose sleep over movies other people like?    This text might be the biggest "DAE REMEMBER THE GREATEST GENERATION" type shit I've ever seen on this sub.    Trans people, i'll allow.  HEY GUYS! THIS GUY WILL ALLOW IT. WE'RE ALL CLEAR FOR THE CONSTRUCTION OF THAT TRANS TEMPLE ON TOP OF NEW YORK CITY.   "I remember the good old days of Game Journalism. When Nintendo Power was owned by Nintendo and bugs didn't crawl on my bed-sheets to eat all this spare Doritos dust."   I think the first Transformers has a better chance than the other three. Transformers 1 was a legit good movie. Even the critics were shocked Michael Bay had pulled off Steve Spielberg's a boy and his dog story so well.   There are no content creators on Voat. The Voaters are starting to realize that the great content creators and karmawhores are the people that run reddit. It's why you can wake up every day and find up to date information. /v/movies has shit from 7 days ago sitting on page 2. There's nothing there but shit posters, the bigots and unfunny assholes that think "DAE Reddit" is a funny joak.  The worst part is the Free Speech clowns keep using this faulty slippery slope argument. Slippery slopes are supposed to end in something bad for it to be a viable argument. Coontown is not going to get any sympathy from any one if it disappears tomorrow. And Anime and their waifus won't be on the chopping block.

TrippieMang had the best k/d (13.0) and he only got 2 ascendant energies :(   Magic Mountain is a whole different amusement park, buddy.....   Can we stop with the "can we stop with the 'can we stop' "posts? I see at least 3 of these a week. Beating to dead horse won't change anything.   What level?   Only requirement is you must have maxed Sultan SA/5. Message Jade Sueta    I can be sword bearer on Crota, relic holder for VoG, can grind out some Iron Banana, etc. Message Jade Sueta.   I can sherpa you through it anytime, add Jade Sueta. Not everyone is like that, you just ran into some bad people.   Thank you for caring, it really means a lot. My step mom is getting gradually better, she buys me Apple cider, and snacks for school. I really think I can make it just a few more months. I AM talking to people about it. You, my mom, I even call my brother in San Francisco from time to time just to vent. Again, thank you.   They spoil them completely. Look at one of my old posts, my 4 y/o bro has an iPad! But when I'm around, I take care of them. When I'm not there, they yell at them *sometimes* but only when they deserve it. They love my little brothers, just not me.   Just a few months, and I can get out. I can wait. None of my teachers like me, or will listen to me. I talk too much and try to get attention, since at home I don't get much. My birthday is in May, I can make it.    I talk to my mom about it a lot and she says I will either have to speak up to them or live with it. She will help me through anything, I know that. I'm just afraid. My school doesn't have a counselor, I dont want to talk to one anyway. Thank you for the kind words. I don't think my dad will do anything physically, he hasn't in a while. The only thing he has done to me was spank, but I think he knows I'm too old for that now. He has threatened once in the past few months, I fear he will go through with it, but deep down I just know he won't. My stepmother threatened to slap me in the face, but I don't even fear her. I just despise her.   I'm trying to take care, but it's just so hard being the only adult around because my father and stepmom won't. I'm practically raising my little brothers.   I will only regret the decision to *not* leave.    I have tried talking to them... My older brother has as well. When that happened, my dad slammed him into a cabinet. He later moved out to my mom's house. When I tried to talk to them, they just started yelling at me that I have a bad attitude and I got grounded for 3 weeks.   My brothers wonderful advice was to put up with it and act like I was happy and always have a smile on my face. Then when I turn 13, move out to my mom's house. My brother waited until my dad pushed him (age 17) because he didn't want me to be alone there. But here I am, about to turn 13, and I'm so so scared of telling them I want to leave. My mom knows, she said my dad would take it to court, and we would have to fight. She said we would win, because dad already has lost a son. If CPS has been called before this on him then surely we will win, right? and it's not about the chores; I'm fine with doing chores. It's that the ONLY time they EVER talk to me is to yell at me about them.   Our family will never come together. You would thing that my bro leaving is a wake up call to them, but it's not. They still think they are the perfect parents with the perfect family, and they will always think that. Some people dont change.     Haha my dad is a cop.   It's not like that. They hate me too. I dont talk to them, I'm basically a maid. You think it's "oh its the standard teenager, saying she hates her (step)parents because they won't get her an iPhone 6". I'm just here ~~so I don't get fined~~ so they can be lazy.   My dad only ever talks to me if it's to do chores/schoolwork. I can't remember the last time he *actually* talked to me. He always yells, and complains that he's so sore from crossfit.   My stepmother acts like she owns me, like I'm an *object*. I don't have real conversations with here either. When I'm at this house, I never talk. Just do chores, mow the lawn, get grounded because I have a bad attitude, and do schoolwork that isn't due for 3 WEEKS. They always yell at me, make me call them Sir and Ma'am.  And I hate them for it.   That they aren't perfect.   Message Jade Sueta to get the grind on!

 Are your in laws really going to be with you for 15 hours a day every day for a week? That seems like a bit much! A lot of people in this sub seem to suggest that visitors never visit for more than an hour at a time since new moms are exhausted and trying to learn how to parent. You shouldn't have to entertain your in laws all day soon after giving birth. If they stay in a hotel, they will have somewhere else to go if you ever want quiet, rest, moments of privacy, or are just plain tired of guests.    Hi all! I've been lurking /r/tryingforababy and /r/BabyBumps for ages, but I've always been disappointed because I don't belong to either. Needless to say, I'm glad this sub exists!  I'm 23 and hubby is 24. We have been together for almost 4 years and in August we will celebrate our 2nd anniversary. Over the years, I've realized that I want nothing more than to be a mom, maybe even a stay at home mom. I obsess over all things parenting - I'm constantly "pinning" things on Pinterest, reading articles about parenting, and I love reading people's experiences over on BabyBumps and BeyondtheBump. However, we haven't found the right time to TTC yet. DH and I both graduated college last year and we are in student debt up to our eyeballs. We are currently living in a crappy, moldy apartment and desperately want out. We currently don't have nearly as much money as we'd like to have before starting a family.  Luckily, DH got an amazing job right out of college, and he's already received a promotion and a nice raise. We are working hard to stick to a budget so we can be in a good place financially. After years of being incredible stupid with money, we finally got our shit together and got ourselves completely out of credit card debt. So all we have in terms of debt is student loans. We're currently focusing on saving money for a house since we NEED to get out of this apartment. Hubby calculates that we can have enough money for a good payment as early as January 2016. Currently, that's the only thing holding us back from TTC. I want a house first or at least be a little closer to buying because (1) I do not want to deal with the stress of moving while pregnant or with a newborn and (2) I do not want to raise a baby in this tiny, moldy apartment.   Anyway, I decided to introduce myself finally thanks to the "Is anyone else not working  amp;amp; trying to find purpose?" thread that was posted the other day. I've been feeling that way for a long, long time. I haven't been working since graduating college due to some minor yet annoying health problems - I suffer from frequent migraines and I'm still trying to get them under control. I know that my purpose in life is to raise a family, and not having kids absolutely kills me. I can't find anyone who understands because everyone tells me that kids are awful or that I'm still young and have plenty of time to have them, and that maybe I should work so I'm not "bored." Ugh. I'm glad I found people who finally understand how I feel.  So anyway... Hello!   Aww, yay! Happy anniversary. Here's to hoping your stay at TryingForABaby is a short one :)   [This baby bird grown as shit](http://m.imgur.com/gallery/X4MTZbu).    I'm just a lowly lurker here... But I thought I would pop in and say the books are amazing. I'm only on book 3 of the series though. I absolutely love reading books with such a strong female protagonist.    I absolutely love the scarves Claire wears on the show, but haven't gotten around to making one. Beautiful! I'm jealous.    Shame   I agree with /u/SageOfTheWise, but I also think more than anything he is just praising the work of Tobias Menzies. Tobias is amazing on Outlander, and GRRM probably wants him to bring his talent back to GoT. He joked that he's jealous Outlander has more air time then GoT, so maybe GRRM is also a little jealous Outlander currently has Tobias's talent?    It's a race to see which will be released first: this or Winds of Winter. My bet is on this...   Stannis is about to lose his father of the year award.  Edit: aaaannnd it's gone.    Wow I see a few from Xavier. Go Muskies! :)   You are correct. My husband is in the financial field and just explained this to me a couple days ago. You cannot contribute more than you earn.    :) Were you there the same week as us? May 9-May 16   I was a little skeptical about staying there at first since it's a value resort - I feared it would have a cheap motel feel to it and would be too crowded. We stayed at French Quarter last time and I thought Pop wouldn't be as nice. I must say, I like Pop so much more. Despite being in a room on the first floor, it was fairly quiet (we were on an end in the middle of nowhere though so that might be why haha). The grounds were beautiful and the 50s pool was relaxing - a nice escape from the hustle and bustle of Disney. Absolutely amazing value.      This happened to us a few weeks ago, on May 15th. We had a fast pass for Space Mountain, but it kept shutting down throughout the day so I kept changing my fast pass for later and later. It ended up shutting down at like 7:00pm and never reopened. I went to change the fast pass on the Disney app and found that I had been given a fast pass I could use on any ride at any time. It was awesome.   "Well I don't want you to give him any grief about this, ya know, cause you could traumatize him and turn him into a serial killer or something." "Well don't worry. How much damage could he do with only one free hand?"   Yeah but George RR Martin survives solely on the tears of fans. Diana does not. She cares about her fans' feelings haha.   	18

 Check out The Year of Darkness. It's my favorite.   You know in the first movie when Hagrid says, "Welcome Harry, to Diagon Alley."?  It's exactly like that.   Thanks for your response.   While reading, I imagined Fenrir to be more like Sabertooth in the Marvel comics.   Basically because of his College career.  Sitting behind Andy showing him the ropes for a year, I think He's the shizz.   He's (Ricky) genius if you ask me.    HAHA! N and V are the letters most used in the entire book.   Rude how, to whom?   Cheers. I have.. um homework to do.   [Have fun](https://youtu.be/Jc20vMz0V7Q)     So you do like Richard Harris?    [HA!](https://youtu.be/Kr9_5uZn6ds)   How? He is stating his beliefs.    Try [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/harrypotter/search?q=how+are+spells+invented restrict_sr=on sort=relevance t=all) then.   I think it was something about two films ending with battles at Hogwarts. What really pissed me off was not including Bill until, "Got in a fight with a werewolf."   Seriously, wtf was that? Harry *knows*, Harry was *there* at Bill's bedside in the hospital wing FFS!   What I am expecting to see from #5 in the preseason is nothing less than spectacular. My question is, what or who could we get for Dalton? Trades in the NFL are rare, but not unheard of.    Because HP was a multi-million dollar franchise.  Cartman would have a fitting line here, "I do what I want!"  Chiris Colubus was the truest to the books I think, Cuaron had a pretty cinescape, and was close to to the script. I have nary a clue where Newell's head was. I thought Yates was good with finishing the series, but he was the only one who actually *added* scenes, and that shit drives me crazy.    I'm not denying a good theory here, it didn't happen like the in the *Prince's Tale* though. Honestly, if I hadn't read the books first, I would have been rather confused. Like I said, they're just fun to look at.   Man, you're going to just have to accept the films more as addendum than canon. They are like nature, they're pretty to look at, but I wouldn't take any HP film adaptation as canon. EXCEPT! The Fantastic Beasts trilogy is being written solely by Ms. Rowling, so that can be canon. We just have to wait.   I thought she was a giant cunt.   I'm going to go with the flow and say Minerva *or* Filius.      In Latin class.   Siriusly though, check the common/repeat questions in the sidebar.   That's a good point.   I have PS in Icelandic. I'll be damned if I can read a word of it, but it's cool to have.  Edit: [Here](http://i.imgur.com/ccowuKZ.jpg) it is.    Because Albus knew the position was cursed and he wanted to live a little while longer.   I'm fairly sure that being a DE was a lifelong commitment, but what about if they simply got too old and feeble to carry out the tasks given to them by Voldemort? Would Riddle send them on their way to retirement with a nice severance package? What are your thoughts?   You could always pick your favorite [chapter art.](http://i.imgur.com/IJQ13E5.jpg)   So's your face.   I will stand by *The Parting of the Ways.*   The brilliance shown by Dumbledore, the reuniting of two old school enemies, and Harry getting the best hug of his life.   I cannot wait to get to that chapter in GoF.   Muriel, that's it.   All good.    That was a Princess Bride reference...   Riddle used Harry's blood for two reasons:  1. He needed the blood of an enemy to regain his full body, and sure he could have used just about any witch or wizard in Britain because he was basically PE #1 at the time, but he chose Harry.  2. Which brings us to the second part, he used Harry's blood because he knew from Quirrellmort that he couldn't touch Harry without dying, so he took his blood in order to be able to.   Only mostly dead.   Also, She didn't want to introduce something new at the end of the book.   Absolutely, I hadn't thought of that.   Being part kneazle and therefore living longer, I think this is a very plausible theory.    In DH when the Weasley Aunt, name escapes me now, says "Ginevra's dress is far too low cut." or something along those lines.   I was reading DH the night/morning of the release, and when Percy toppled out of the portrait into the RoR, I sat the book on my lap and clapped, "YAY!" My wife was getting ready for work, and looked at me  like I had a third eye in the middle of my forehead.   NFL shut most of those sites down.   I have a black Dalton, white Green, orange Maualuga, and a black Gresham.      Friends.   ..but sometimes when I smoke, I cry like a little girl. I get emotional too easy when I'm high.  Edit: When I'm watching a cool man movie like Field of Dreams, or watching the US women win today.   They don't look you in the eye when they talk. I have two teenage daughters, and I *always* know when they are lying.    or they could create a new scene  Wouldn't be the first time...      If they didn't include Grawp, how would they have explained Harry and Hermione escaping Umbridge?   It's in the hospital wing after the tri wizard tourney. When Molly was at Harry's bedside and Albus knew that Voldemort had returned. He sent Snape to Voldemort, sent Lupin to the werewolves, Hagrid to the giants, Sirius was revealed as innocent, he regrouped the order and he did all of this within hours of Riddle's return.  Not to mention, Harry got the first hug that actually felt like it was from a mother.    It's my belief that the DEs only came to Hogwarts because Draco had been given a task to do, and it had taken too long. Either he needed the backup to give him the balls to do it, or expected one of the foul fuckers he let in to do it.   For me, it would be when I get a new bag. I always start with the smallest buds, and I save the biggest for last. I also smoke the buds from bottom to top when I grind them.  Now I'm off to the village festivities. Happy Fourth! [7.5]   Right.. antlers.   Or people who adorn themselves with leaves and shit. I've been smoking almost 23 years, and I keep it to myself. You might describe my appearance as "stoner-like", long hair, goatee, comfortable clothes, but no one that doesn't know me would think I'm a smoker, because I am well spoken and if I do say so my myself, fairly intelligent.   No shit, I could buy 13 grams of some quality cannabis for that, and it would last me more than a month.    Or the kids with those damn glass packs on the muffler. An ex of mine had one on her car, and I refused to drive it or ride in it.   That date is completely off, but otherwise pretty cool.   No Bagman either. He was a bigger story arc than Winky.   It wasn't said, but most people think he stayed at the burrow after the trio left the wedding so suddenly.    *The Parting of the Ways*  It's the first time we get to see the absolute power of Dumbledore, and how he can so quickly set his plans in motion.         I have been swarmed by yellow jackets three times in my life. The first, I was around six years old, second was around 12, and the third was in my mid 20s. Each time I took about thirty stings.   Each chapter with new writing has a red quill in the upper right corner, so you can just look for those.   At the time he was Buckbeak.   Yea, but not this one.    Retro is cool.    You lot seem to forget that at least two of *The Advanced Guard* were ministry employees at the time, maybe Kingsley and Tonks set up some sort of jinx so the ministry wouldn't know.      Polygamy is still a weird subject  Not in Utah      Nice post, but I will say this. I have close friends my age with kids my kids age. I do *not* treat or talk to them the same way I do my own children. Their kids are more like little friends that I can tell dirty jokes to, and teach them nasty habits. Probably why no one has made me godfather yet.   She had five brothers left to use the family names, and she named Pigwidgeon.    Luna was also one of Ginevra's best friends.   They spent plenty of time together at 12GP in OotP, unless Sirius was sulking in his room with Buckbeak.   Witherwings, if you please.   Plot.      That was a waste of a half hour of my life.          HBP is also my favorite book. I'm not really a fan of the films, but you could say the same.  Harry has that swagger going on, he is like his father, just.. cool. He's worried about Draco of course, and he uses a curse that [SPOILER] Snape taught him to battle Draco, the showdown we finally got to see.  When it came to The Cave, Harry did exactly as he was instructed to. He kept feeding Albus the potion in order to get the [SPOILER] locket from the basin. And then he even chases down Snape and Malfoy because [SPOILER] Snape killed Dumbledore.  IMO, HBP was the best 'whodunnit'.   I like this better than the other. It's all about timing mate.    My wife dropped ten pounds in two weeks on that diet.   Yes, white bread, pizza, donuts, biscuits, pasta, cookies... go whole grain.  And sugar.   Only water, and cut out white flour.      Meh...   I would take a lass, and use for an hour of sweet, sweet love.   Sure he could.   LOL!!!   I love this one too.    Bertha was pregnant when Wormtail killed her, and they took her baby to give Riddle his body back.  Some have even suggested that he impregnated her.   Mine is that Voldemort got his rudimentary body back in GOF by using Bertha Jorkin's fetus.   Harry wasn't a true horcrux, this is BS.  EDIT: Horcruxes require a spell beforehand, and they are heavily protected by dark magic, none of this happened when the part of Tom Riddle's soul attached itself to the only other living thing in the house. The damn cat must have been out hunting.  EDIT2: You can downvote all you like, but She has stated this herself. Harry was not a *true* horcrux.   Harry looks scared. He's probably wondering when his hooman is going to come back and get him.   Predator could be an intergalactic bounty hunter too  No the predator species were just intergalactic hunters for the sport.   I am going to disagree with the general consensus. Boba is an intergalactic bounty hunter, and I think he has the edge. He's seen all sorts of beings, and I'm almost sure Jango taught him a few tricks of the trade. The first BAMF to escape the sarlaac definitely gets the win.      Haha, I mean the family vault not just Albus, I should have specified.    What do you think would be in the Dumbledore vault at Gringotts?   Thriller   Red River Gorge   My dad told me as soon as they put that in my IV I lifted three nurses off the floor with each arm, then I flatlined.   Stripes or any John Candy film for that matter.    Something about an invisible man in the sky.   No. I don't even remember the time I was out.  I was dead for about 45 seconds due to an allergic reaction to the MRI dye.     Jim Gaffigan. Just something about his delivery.     I will be locking the Roster the evening of June 1st!  Should be July, but I'm excited!   I saw these guys at the Tibetan Freedom Show in 97. They were an absolute highlight. I was crowd surfing most od the time, and Tim stuck his gum in my hair.   Another extremely plausible theory, but I doubt the Malfoys would have kept Frank around.   It is entirely possible that Albus bought it to give Frank Bryce something to do. That seems very Dumbledore like.   The Year of Darkness.   Pittsburgh, because I'm from Cincinnati.   I have that one, but I've lost the cape.   I think I got it, thanks.     I guess that makes some sort of sense.    OH! So you ask one, what the other would  say?  	118
 People are just pissed that everyone but Ripley dies at the very beginning.  Couple that with the well-documented studio tampering and tinkering with Fincher, and you get an under-performing movie that everyone remembers as way worse than it is.  But, you're right, it is just fine.  I'll tell you what - if *Terminator: WeCan'tSpell*, *Star Wars: The Force*, and *Jurassic The Lost World Park World* are half of what Alien 3 was, then the 2015 blockbuster season will have over-performed.    If only our teams weren't playing on the same day, I would have considered going with you, for sure.   This would indeed be the darkest timeline.     What about on [Year Day] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Fixed_Calendar)?   If it makes you feel any better, my past interactions with you have led me to tag you essentially just that, so I am never confused when you say good things about the Peyton-led Broncos.   Groovy, man.  My wife got me a bottle of the 18 for Christmas - I'll have a dram in your honor tonight.   Go Panthers!  I want you cats to make some noise over there in the NFC!   I have had multiple bottles of both.  The 10 is very strong on the peat, extremely smokey and a little harsh.  There is also a clear medicinal character that comes through.  The 18 is very much the same idea, but I feel like the proportions are slightly different:  the peat is still up front and strong, but it is a little more rounded and smooth than the 10.  And the medicinal quality is the same, if not slightly stronger.  Recommendation:  get the 10; it is about 50-60% of the price, and will not be subtle about anything.  If you hate it, you probably won't like the 18, and if you love it you'll want to try the 18 later anyway.  If you try it and are on the fence, you might consider the 18 if you just want something a little smoother or less in-your-face.   You don't deserve watching your team play in the playoffs.   Yeah, I only have the fragmented paper backup - I restore the wallet from the paper fragments whenever I make a spend transaction from the cold storage.  You *could* keep a digital version too, but I don't.  I *might* decide to keep a USB with it encrypted - but that introduces a very weak single point (someone steals the USB).  They'd still need to break the encryption, though, so I am not sure.  I do have the fragment files encrypted and in the possession of four individuals who have good data storage practices.  So, if my paper fragments get lost in simultaneous fires, floods, etc, I CAN restore from a digital source, but it takes a number of additional steps (I have to collect the fragments from my buddies, decrypt them, and THEN restore the wallet).  Armory has an option for making fragmented paper backups.  The Armory website has lots of very good tutorials for that kind of thing (and lots more). Be sure to use the SecurePrint option to prevent someone from spying on your printer (or, write the fragment seeds by hand).   Yes.  You only need to know two Star Wars things:  1.  Laser Swords ("Lightsaber" in the parlance of the Star Wars) are awesome.  2.  You can lightning people, freeze people, choke people, and push/throw people.  In this game it isn't magic or mana.  It is "The Force".  Enjoy.   No worries, buddy.   Didn't I allow for bitcoin-based solutions to deferred payments in my second paragraph?  What in particular do you think I am incorrect about?  I definitely think that the solutions and points you made are right on.  Maybe you think I am giving Mr. CEO too much credit for his shortsighted opinion?    Exactly right.  Very important thing to keep in mind.  In fact you wouldn't even need a card - just flip your hardware wallet into credit mode with a button!   A Few tips:  1.  Don't mine.  Others have linked you to hardware specs and mining calculators, but for the most part the only people who can mine (profitably) are dedicated outfits with cheap electricity, cheap hardware, or both.  In general, as the hashing difficulty increased, it too more and more specific hardware to mine profitably.  So, it went from CPU - GPU - ASICs pretty quickly.  Now you certainly need ASICs.  If you're a big hardware geek, you might like putting together a mining rig as a hobby, however, so that's up to you.  2.  Do not day trade bitcoin.  It is too easy to lose money there.  3.  Figure out if you like the technology enough to buy some bitcoins for savings, or whether you'd rather just use it to pay for things / experiment.  4.  Educate yourself on good security practices.  5.  **If you do not own the private keys, you do not own the bitcoin**.   This seems like a reasonable enough opinion to me.  Credit cards are fine at deferring payment (never mind that they charge a *ridiculous* percentage of the amount for this "service").  And the "market share" of Credit, Cash/Debit, Bitcoin, if you want to call it that makes plain that there is lots of money out there and it is unlikely that Bitcoin will destroy or replace everything.  But, a bitcoin protocol could just as easily delay payment, and probably with less overhead and thus fewer ineffciencies.  I respect where this guy is coming from (different people have different payment needs; there's lots of room for many alternatives), but don't be surprised if Bitcoin is capable of performing the tasks that you figured were only the domain of the established payment systems.   Mycelium Wallet lets you import addresses by scanning a WIF QR code. (BIP32, too, I think).   The Armory website has a lot of nice tutorial videos for doing all kinds of things with that software.  Offline transactions are explained pretty well!     I'll help you out a bit by giving you an overview of the process that I have pieced together from a couple of different sources.  First, this is fairly time-consuming, but really only happens when I am legitimately moving a lot of bitcoins out of savings and into something else.  Ultimately, I like the setup because I feel like there are multiple redundant protections.  I like to imagine a virus called, "The Perfect Bitcoin Thief" or PBT, for short:  this virus can read all of your files and the clipboard, plus logs all of your keystrokes and will keep them in any available memory until it has an internet connection.  This is probably paranoia, but it helps me think in a worst-case kind of way.  So, like you, I have armory running a full client on a computer connected to the internet.  On here I have a general-spending wallet which is encrypted.  I don't keep many bitcoins in that wallet, it is mostly for a way to move coins on my PC (like, if I am buying a plane ticket from expedia or something).  The other wallet I have is a Watch Only Savings wallet, so I can't spend from it on the online machine at all.  This "Savings" wallet is backed up with a 3-of-4 fragmented paper backup.  I have the different fragments stored in distinct places (both within my residence and without), as well as encrypted digital backups I have sent friends/family members in case of some weird total loss.  So, to spend from my watch-only wallet, I boot an offline machine into TAILS from a USB stick with nothing else on it.  Then I can create an unsigned transaction with the watch only, transfer to the TAILS machine, sign it, and transfer it back to broadcast.  It all ends up looking like this:  1.  Create Unsigned transaction from watch-only wallet.  2.  Boot up TAILS from a live USB stick.  3.  Use another *virgin* USB stick which **never touches a machine that sees the internet** to load the offline bundle of Armory.  You *can* have a wallet file on this USB, too, but I just rebuild it from my paper fragments, as that reduces the risk.  4.  Sign transactions and move the signed transaction file between the TAILS system and the full Armory system.  5.  Broadcast the transaction from the full Armory computer.  So, how does PBT fair against my setup?  1.  The watch-only wallet with the funds has no private keys on the computer with connection to the internet.  PBT can have this wallet file - it does no good.    2.  The only system which *ever* sees the fragmented backups (and hence the private keys) is TAILS without an internet connection.  Once I have the wallet, I load up the unsigned transaction, sign it, and eject the USB.  Unless my USB somehow downloads PBT, there's no way in.  TAILS wipes itself clean after every shutdown, so there's nowhere for the private keys to be stored, either.  3.  When connecting the USB with the signed transaction, do so with the Armory computer unconnected to the internet.  Then you can unload the signed transaction file and disconnect the USB, keeping it cleaner.  Be sure to look over your signed transaction before you broadcast it to make sure things are going where you want them too, just in case.  So that's it!  The main point of failure is (admittedly) the fragmented paper backup.  If someone was to steal three of the four fragments, they could reconstruct my wallet from scratch, and start spending those funds.  But, in a situation where one is in my home safe, one is in a security deposit box at a bank, one is at a family member's house, and one is in a file in my file cabinet at work (called something innocuous like "Group B Meeting Minutes, 2004"), I think this is an acceptable amount of risk.  Note:  these are only examples; I didn't just tell the internet where my paper backup fragments are!  If you wanted to make this a little more secure, you could run the 2-of-3 Lockbox into the same kind of system - only signing transactions on an offline TAILS machine.  I think you can do that, anyway.  Not sure.  I hope that helps.  I have been struggling with finding a system that makes me feel at ease, and I think this one is my favorite so far.    To be fair, I am pretty confident that if my house cat was the size of a serval or caracal (to say nothing of a lion or tiger), she'd kill me too, one of these days.   I see you've been in *1989* for too long, too.   Ooh, I have been toying with hate-watching "God is ^not Dead" for a while now.  How drunk should I get to make it entertaining?   There's some good, technical answers here, complete with some nice links, but the ELI5 is this:  Every bitcoin transaction needs to FULLY SPEND the funds in an address.  The amount you "want" to spend goes to the address you wanted, and the remainder is returned as change.   Is *Nymphomaniac* another example of this, or did Lars von Trier want it to be two parts?   As the article suggests, there may be some relationship between having very large gaps in between primes and some cryptographic algorithms, but I seriously doubt that this will affect much in a practical sense.  Different cryptographic systems take advantage of the properties of large prime numbers in different ways (difficulty of factoring the product of two large primes, arithmetic modolo a large prime, etc, etc), but largely these algorithms don't choose the prime numbers to use based off of the gap size between the adjacent primes.  Like, if you wanted to use the first of a twin prime for the modulo arithmetic of RSA - you could (I don't know if you would want to, though - the twin primes are kinda special so many very large ones are well-known, slightly reducing your randomness).  Ultimately, it seems to me that this work is largely academic (and very interesting, don't get me wrong!) but it likely has only slight application to most cryptographic systems.  If someone with a little more background in the nuts-and-bolts of these disciplines (Number Theory and Cryptography) believes that I have missed something critical, I'd love to hear about it, as I am merely an armchair prime number enthusiast.    Our elite corner already said this.  Get your own material, Sherman!  [Source] (https://twitter.com/brandonspano/status/539911905511735297)     sick.  bookmarked.   Maker's (and Maker's 46) have the quality of being slightly sweeter and lighter than a lot of bourbons (it comes from being so heavily made from wheat).  Other great options in the Maker's price range which could have slightly different tastes are Buffalo Trace, Eagle's Rare, Four Roses, Bulleit (both bourbon and rye) and even slightly nicer things like Woodland Reserve (which I don't really care for, personally - but lots of folk dig).  You go up a price point and you get Willett (Rye is awesome, bourbon's fine, too), Blanton's, and a bunch more.  Feel around with different profiles, definitely try out a rye or two for the spicy character (Bulleit Rye for the low end, Willet or Whistlepig for the high end) and see where it takes you.  Oh man.  And then there's scotch . . .   This is one of those crazy coincidences that makes life so cool!  I was thinking about this exact problem for the last few days, but it was on a much more abstract level as I am not trained as a computer scientist.  As a Bitcoin enthusiast, though, I was focusing on utilization blockchain-like technology to get it done, so I am excited to read your stuff.  I am going to enjoy reading this thoroughly; thanks for the full text!  It isn't easy completing an advanced degree (March '14 for me).  Have a beer on me as a congratulations! /u/changetip    I count in base 12 all the time (dozenal).  It's pretty sweet.   No shit.  Do you sex and money?   You are Spartacus!  (By the way, this *should* be the response when some group or another tries to threaten a select few - everyone stands in opposition.  It should have happened with the Danish Cartoons, and it should have happened here.)   Hmm.  What's the difference between jam and jelly?   Calmer than you are.   I took your comment at face-value, assuming that you meant that ESPN anchors would literally be sitting in a circle, jerking each other off in a communal masturbatory fantasy focusing on Tebow and Manziel as they scramble and throw mostly off-target passes.  They could get a new plexiglass desk so you could get a real good view of all the cranking going on down there.    Who do you think has the biggest cock?  I'm a homer, so I'd like to think the TJ has a nice, strong, veiny one - even in his old age.  Though it is always the unassuming guys like Schefter who have the pythons.  Okay, I'll stop now.   [Relevant xkcd] (http://xkcd.com/37/)   All right then.  They've got the 9ers next week, they should be push-overs.     Please game-plan as if Manning is hurt.  Seriously.  Put 8 in the box, because he can't beat you 40-yards down-field between the numbers, at all.    If there are coordinators who seriously do think this, they should probably be fired.   Probably all of those things at once.  Some folk will be more savvy, some less.  The article claims that there are some businesses already accepting, and have been even before the announcement of the Bitcoin Bowl.  So, you'd assume that the earlier folk know what they're doing.   Or [Coywolves!] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coywolf)  Thanks, nature.     This is exactly why the #5 seed in the NFC isn't going to cakewalk through the first round.  Of course, the Panthers, Saints, and Falcons are having sub-par years (all at once!), but would you really like for your first playoff game to be against Drew Brees or Matt Ryan in a dome?  Sure, they looks very, very bad for a long time.  But you only get to play one game.  It sure would be unfortunate if you ran into a buzzsaw.   Likewise.  I had basically already written off NY state - I just "knew" they were going to fuck up and get something wrong.  Glad to be wrong!    You're right there, and the next step is actually just an "Eureka!!!" moment:  You don't remove the incentive!  You want to move house deeds, car titles, AirBnB keys, notarized documents, etc, etc over a blockchain?  Then the "miners" who are securing this chain get transaction fees (in bitcoin).  Alternatively, you could be rewarded with a different cryptocurrency, which may have its own value (either within this particular blockchain, or through exchanging it for bitcoin).  Simple example:  I want a blockchain which allows the movement of car titles.  Whenever someone wants to sell a car and transfer the title, they hop on CarCoin, broadcast the transaction (Title 1:  Owner A -- Owner B, agreed price, etc, etc) to the network.  At set interval, all transactions are placed into the next block, mining happens, and someone wins the race, the blockchain is extended, miner's fees are given to the miners (this could even be in bitcoin!), and CarCoin reward is given to the miner who won the race.    Maybe CarCoin can be exchanged for bitcoin.  Maybe CarCoin can buy cars outright.  Maybe the transaction fees (in bitcoin) provide enough of an incentive, particularly because this mining would be less difficult than bitcoin mining.      I'm gonna tell him . . .   Look up the Dutch Tulip bubble.  It was one of the weirdest and clearest examples of a financial bubble in the preindustrial world.  Basically tulip bulbs became huge stores of value until one day it just popped.  First comment is saying Bitcoin is a bubble.  Second person is saying that argument is old and worn out.     Yup.  Worked out just fine!  Thanks!    Pretty cool.  How many brick-and-mortar joints in Chicago accept bitcoin?  I did a search about two months ago on one of the store finders and found nothing.   The other woman (Anne Sullivan) was the miracle worker.  Helen Keller was the one who got miracled on.    Yeah, he was a solid punter in college.     Yeah, he did in college, and also in preseason with the Titans (I believe). Will edit with source.  edit:  [Source](http://www.giants.com/team/roster/Brandon-McManus/68d3ec74-2f8e-4dde-80df-3638a4063651).  Very reasonable punter in college, not clear if he punted in NFL preseason from this blurb.   Yeah, that's the idea.  He punted in college (and I believe early in his pro career with Tennessee in preseason games or something).  This would also clear some more monies off the cap for next year.  edit:  in three years punting in college he had averages of 42.3 (on 4 punts) 45.8 (on 46 punts) and 45.1 (on 54 punts).  That seems pretty reasonable to me, right?  It isn't like punting is that much different between pro and college levels.   Looks like Barth will be on a short leash regarding kickoffs.  I would say if he has another poor showing on kickoffs this week (especially in Denver), then we can expect one of two moves:  1.  McManus is signed to the active roster as a kickoff specialist / long FG kicker. Room is made by dropping an end-of-bench player to the practice squad.    2.  McManus is signed as a Kickoff specialist / Punter.  Britton Colquit is waived.  This is the more extreme of the two moves.   Largely, the differences are cosmetic, I admit.  But Mastercard is explicitly attacking something that I believe in (albeit very poorly), so they have given me a reason.  Ideally, I could bail on all of them (Master, AmEx, and Visa) and relegate my relationship with them to zero or close to zero.  At the moment, it is a step in the right direction to reduce my footprint, so to speak.   Groovy, thanks a bunch, will continue thinking about this.  Here's 1000 bits for your trouble! /u/changetip     How has this gone for you?  Not asking about RoI or anything like that, more about how the process went, whether it was difficult and if so where the sticking points were.  Happy with it?  Would you do it again (for example, if a spouse or sibling wanted to set one up)?   I think I am going to close my MasterCard account.  They make me call them up to do it.  I have never really had the impetus to actually go forward with it (yay inertia!), but I think this might do it.  If they ask me why, I think I will tell them that it is because their stance on Bitcoin is blatant protectionism and ultimately destructive.   The Broncos did it in '85, too.  Admittedly it was easier then as only 5 teams made the playoffs, but there were also fewer automatic berths (3 vs the 4 we have now).  So, you can say that both the '85 Broncos and '08 Patriots were third in the Wild Card race at 11-5.  Pretty crazy.   I came up with all kinds of schemes like this, but here's the problem:  Division A B C (in AFC) and Division D E F (in NFC).  Let's say that first year it is A vs B, C vs D and E vs F (this is the most difficult case - we both seem to understand that it is easy when it is only cross conference years).  In your system, A and B play each other, meaning that to get their last two games they have to play 1 game against the similar finish from C, and one game against the similar finish from D (for A) and E (for B).  This is what you call "same division but cross conference".  Unfortunately, while E is fine with this, D is not.  D is already playing a full division cross conference (C), so their schedule is easily filled with the two like-finishing teams from their conference (E and F)  See, the trouble that I always ran into was that with only 6 divisions, if they all didn't play cross-conference, then you'd have a mixed split:  4 divisions would play within the conference, and two wouldn't.  Making symmetric schedules with that happening causes sad problems!  More and more I like a 5-year rotation where you play every team in the division.  The final two games will always be the teams with like finishes in your conference, resulting in some years where you play a home-and-home against a non-divisional conference foe.  I like that a lot, actually.  So, in our example from above, A vs B, C vs D, and E vs F we get the following: C and D are cross conference, so their schedules are easy, they just play like finishes from their conference.  A and B play each other, the similar finish from C, and the similar finish between A and B again (E and F are similar).  Could you imagine Broncos/Patriots with a home-and-home?  Or Green Bay/Seattle?  The potential for a third game in the playoffs?  That's pretty awesome.   Yeah, that was something that I really didn't like.  The trouble is, if you decide to play an entire division on a rotating schedule, it becomes nontrivial to schedule those last two games (because when you play in your conference, you don't have only two opponents at like finishes - you have four.  Any ideas? At first I thought you could  have a cycle using two divisions (like now).  But because there are only 6 divisions, nothing matches up.  My favorite solution (and possibly most elegant) is that when you play an entire division in your conference, you still play the teams in your conference with like finishes.  This creates scenarios where two teams in the same conference but from different divisions play each other twice (home and home).  Would be great for playoff positioning.   Winning one more game then NE from here on out is hardly "a miracle".  Both Broncos and Patriots play a home game against Buffalo, and a Road game against San Diego.  The Patriots then get @Jets and Miami, whereas Denver gets @Cincy and Oakland.  Sure, their schedule is a little easier than ours, but Miami already beat them once, and the Jets lost on a last-second FG.  Recall that it was the exact same scenario last year, and the Patriots lost to the Dolphins to give up the #1 seed.  Also, one scenario that very few of the talking heads mention, is that in the case of a 3-way tie (or more) at the top of the conference, they no longer rely on head-to-head records as the tiebreaker.  So, even though New England beat us, Cincy, and Indy, that tiebreaker only matters if they are trying to break a single tie.  For example, if Denver, New England, and Cincinnati all lose one more game and Indianapolis wins out, those teams will be 12-4, 12-4, 11-3-1, and 12-4, respectively. But, the tiebreaker doesn't go to the Patriots (for beating Indy and Denver head-to-head) - it goes to the Broncos for having the better conference record (in this case, 10-2, the Pats and Colts already have lost 2 and 3 AFC games, respectively).  My point is:  we have a fairly good chance, especially with the way we are playing!   Definite feature of this realignment.  Also, it will be very, very unlikely that a division can be run away with in a six team setup - at least two teams will be very good most of the time.  edit:   I mean, let's just pretend that the expansion teams are all garbage for now, and you still have six ultra-competative divisions:  The AFC West is the same:  Broncos, Chargers, Chiefs at the top within 2 games.  The AFC Central is mind-boggling, as you have the Bengals at 8-3-1, Colts at 8-4, Steelers, Browns, Ravens at 7-5.    The AFC East is the weakest, with the Patriots having a 2-game lead on everyone.  NFC is pretty much the same, largely because the NFC South is underperforming this year.     How often does she tease you about Favre?   Yeah, we're really close.  It really just comes down to what you'd like to preserve:  rivalry, or geography, and I can see arguments for both.   My thoughts were similar, but I decided to completely preserve the East/North/West divisions.  It's cool to see just how close we were to each other.   I'm going to give my try at this, too.  I love Nate Silver and read his piece when it came out, so I will stay with London, Toronto, Mexico City, and Los Angeles as the expansion cities.  I think that the best way to actually add new teams isn't to stir up everything as much as possible to make "geographic sense", but to make small tweaks while preserving age-old rivalries.  Hence, I will be working with two Conferences (AFC and NFC; if you want to change the "National Football Conference" to the "International Football Conference" that would be fine, too, but I'll keep them the Same.  **American Football Conference**   East |  Central |  West ------------|--------------|------------- New England | Pittsburgh | Denver Miami | Cleveland | Kansas City New York Jets | Cincinnati | Oakland Buffalo | Indianapolis | San Diego Jacksonville | Tennessee | Houston Toronto | Baltimore | Mexico City  and  **National Football Conference**  East | Central | West  ----------|-----------------|----------------- Dallas | Green Bay | San Francisco Philadelphia | Chicago | Seattle Washington | Minnesota | Arizona New York Giants | Detroit | St. Louis Carolina | Tampa Bay | New Orleans London | Atlanta | Los Angeles   For the most part, I like this re-alignment.  I am a little pissed that New Orleans has to be in the NFC West, and that Atlanta and Tampa moved to the Central, but there are just SO MANY east coast teams that some of them had to go somewhere.  I was basically able to keep every East, West, and North division together, then got to sprinkle in members of the South with new teams where they made (at least some) sense. This is *kind of* disrespectful to the AFC and NFC South, but frankly if you were to choose a division in each conference to break up, these are the most recently created, and harm historical rivalries the least.  Indy/Tennessee and Tampa Bay/Atlanta get to bring a buddy with them, but the Saints, Panthers, Texans, and Jaguars are not so lucky.  But, except for the Saints, these are all relatively recent expansion teams, so it seams like the way to do the least harm.  So, there's my two cents:  we preserve the most storied rivalries, add two new teams to each conference in geographically sound divisions, and are even fairly immune to moves by the Rams, Raiders, or Chargers (i.e., the geography still makes sense if they go to LA, San Antonio, etc).  As for the schedule - we bump it up to 20 weeks with two bye weeks and two preseason games (so, 22 game-weeks, vs. the 21 we have now).  The byes can either be strategically placed to allow teams to travel internationally / play on Thursday, *or* can be set up so that each team gets a bye in the first half and second half of the year.    The scheduling would be a little complex, but I think very cool:  10 games against your division (home   home, obv), 6 games against another division from the opposite conference, and 2 games against those in your conference who finish at a similar ranking as you. This reduces the number of game that you play within your conference, unfortunately, but I don't see another option.  I would be glad to hear others' thoughts on this one.   Camps can start a little earlier to allow for joint practice sessions and/or additional talent evaluation.  Because 12/36 playoff teams is equal to the percentage of teams that currently make the playoffs in baseball (with the WC play-in game it is now 10/30, the same ratio), you could choose to keep it to 12 teams, or you could bump it up to 14, where the top seed in each conference gets a bye.  I am also a fan of moving towards a seeded bracket with no regard for conference, but that is a different discussion.    No Thursday night games unless both teams are coming off of a bye!  Late in the season (after College Football's regular season is done), you can schedule two games on Saturday to highlight additional playoff-potential games.  These could be scheduled in advance with the opportunity to flex, as the Sunday night games are now.  Thoughts?  tl;dr - Keep West/East/North largely intact, sprinkle members of the South and new teams throughout those.  Go to 20 weeks (18 games), and possibly add two more playoff teams.    In addition, there were those two plays (first Tamme, then DT) where the receiver dropped a sure touchdown that hit him in the hands.  This led to our first FG.  Then to close the 2nd half, DT tried to shake-and-bake and ended up with a 3rd-and-1 instead of a 1st-and-Goal with ~20 seconds left (no timeouts).  That is the difference between one shot at the endzone, and three.  This was our second FG.  No doubt, there are always near-misses in the red zone which downgrade TDs into FGs, but these seemed to be out-of-character for our team.   FUCK!  I knew that sounded funny.  Oh well.  Leaving it because mistakes are important.   Personally I agree with you that it isn't a "Stellar Human Hall of Fame" but a lot of people think that character plays a factor.  Keeping a bad human in the Hall of Fame isn't hypocritical by itself, of course.  But promoting a "No More" campaign against domestic violence while a man who murdered his ex-wife is in your Hall of Fame?  That's a little harder for me to swallow.  (For what it is worth, the NFL claims that its Hall of Fame is privately run and so they can't decided who is in and who is out.  Which I am sure is true.)      That's fucking gross!  I'll take the Crab Juice.   But not gamblers!  We can't have those sick fucks gracing the glory of Springfield, MA!  Although, to be completely fair, a bronze bust of Mr. Orenthal James Simpson still sits in Canton to this day.   I think it was more about bringing him on one or two weeks before a game against his former team.  I really didn't care much, because I doubted that he even had very much info, but some folk were calling for rule changes here (so a coach couldn't be hired until the off season).   Yeah, that was exactly why I avoided blends - seems a ploy to make more cheap stuff with hints of the more scarce, expensive stuff.   Very cool stuff.  I don't think I have had a blended American Whiskey before that I really enjoyed.   I do like those things.  I shall investigate.   If the Pats lose *one* more game in this last quarter of the season than do the Broncos, the #1 seed belongs to the Broncos.  Your team offers one of the two best chances at a Patriots loss (the other being Miami).  Also, we get to take care of you ourselves in two weeks.  We already flubbed that one @ New England.   I just moved to Wisconsin for the first time!   It's been fine.  Cheese curds are cool.  Need to buy some cognac.  You know any good cognac?   What's the opening line, Horsefriend?  I would relish seeing Felipe Rios ravage Mr. Bellichick and his Patriots.   I am pretty sure that Fox was back from his heart thing by the last week of the year (@ Oakland, week 17), but he did miss @San Diego (1 week after the bye, when he learned of his heart dealie), and I think that @Kansas City was the last game he missed.  Regardless, those games where there are interim coaches with the HC out for injury are *generally* credited as HC wins for both the interim coach (so, Jack of the River) and the head coach.  Which is weird.  So, *technically* he is 11-0.  But he actually only coached in 9 of those games.   Yeah, that's what I meant - McDaniels left the Rams and joined the Patriots for that post-season, slightly more than one-year removed from being fired by Denver.  It was argued (by some) that it was a little shady, although I don't think it matters all that much.   I have a perfect example of this!  I was a with a group of friends about 5 or 6 years ago down in Tampa (went to school in Gainesville), and we were going to a Crepe joint before seeing a Cirque du Soleil show.  Anyway, on our way out of the restaurant, I saw a family with two young kids: one was probably 9 or 10, and the other maybe 1-2 years younger.  The older one was proudly sporting a new Buccaneers jersey (I do not recall which player), whereas the younger one had on a Tom Brady jersey.  When I tried to explain to my friends that the younger child was very likely a scum-of-the-Earth bandwagoner, and his older brother/friend the true champion and deserving of our praise, I was judged as being far too harsh.  Perhaps I shouldn't have gone so far as to say that I "hated" the little bastard - but I calls 'em like I sees 'em.   Didn't he get fired at the end of the season, and the Bellichick brought him in as an "offensive consultant" just before the Tebow Broncos had to go to New England?  I remember Woody Paige bitching about it (he does that a lot, though).   Oh god, NO!  I attended UF for graduate school (and my wife for both undergrad and grad school!).  *We must not suffer this abysmal man to coach another of our beloved blue   orange teams!*   Well, I guess it makes sense that the Niners fan doesn't know about him.  He was only targeted five times (two receptions for 9 yards!) in the San Francisco game.    Damn, you're right - my head was somewhere else.  My point stands - bowling ball.   Low center of gravity.  He's like 5'8" and 180ish.  He's like a fucking bowling ball.   Let's see:  Last week (Mia)  The week before (St. Louis)  The week before that (Oakland)  And the week before that (New England).      Looks good to me.  I was concerned about Barth's kickoffs (as that was the one part of McManus's game that was *very* strong), but this is encouraging!   Does it make me an asshole to take this piece less seriously because the author makes multiple grammar mistakes throughout?  Here's one sentence (fragment!) early on:  A world that is experience(sic) the side effects of rampant climate change, a country where we would rather spend $11.50 on a movie ticket then(sic) spend that much per year, per person to adequately fund the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA).   I know good grammar, diction, spelling, etc are not the most important things in the world, and these could just be honest mistakes.  But if your goal is to persuade readers with cogent arguments, shouldn't you be really careful about these things?  It just comes off as lazy, sloppy, and frankly ill-informed.  If Mr. Manser doesn't take the time to proofread his piece (or simply doesn't know the difference), how confident am I supposed to be in the more high-level analysis and opinions that he puts forth?   "I can't swim".   So, after a little bit of reading, I have come to understand that these molecules (in their liquid state) *are not flammable*.  So, I couldn't just take a torch to the hydrocarbon lake and burn the whole thing up, right?   I want the Falcons to go undefeated in the division and windless outside of the division.   I am afraid of Julius Thomas becoming a Raider next year.   If you want to look only at last year, then you can do that, but I'd rather not base my evaluation of a player on his extreme outlier, career year.     Yeah, as far as I know, Dustin is fine.  I am not sure what his cap hit is, but with a team built like the Chiefs (more T.O.P controlly, willing to play the field position game with an Alex Smith), there is more of a reason to have a higher-paid punter than there is with a Peyton Manning offense.   There is no metric by which you can consider Prater "one of the best kickers in the league", unless you look only at his one stellar season (2013, where he went 25-for-26), or perhaps "Longest FG", for which he of course owns the record.  His work as a whole is fairly average. [Here] (http://www.pro-football-reference.com/leaders/fg_perc_career.htm) you'll see that he is 31th all-time in career FG%, ranking 20th among active kickers.  So, there are 19 kickers currently playing that are more accurate.  I will grant you that he is stellar from 50+ (24/32 or 75%), but that is tempered by his 40-49 (37/58 or 63.7%).  Ultimately, I think releasing Prater was the correct choice, due to the money issue and the potential off-the-field issue.  Perhaps McManus was the wrong replacement, but the small sample size make me want to see more of him, despite the funk he is in.  Maybe his confidence is just completely gone, but kickers go through funks all the time, and he is still a rookie.     ooh, I like sneaky intra-division moves/rumors.   Exactly my point.  With the money the Broncos could save on just these two players, they could, for example, pay Julius Thomas's franchise tag next year (or very close to it, depending on the value), if they decide to go that way.  Even if the impact isn't quite *that* high, the highest return on that money cannot be Prater or Colquitt, even if they are top 5 at their position (which they are not).   I don't think they regret releasing Prater.  They may regret signing McManus (and subsequently losing a 7th round draft pick to the Giants), but getting Prater's money off of the books was a very smart idea.  I believe that the same thing will happen with Colquitt (punter) next year.   This is slightly false - The 33 yard FG was missed while we were down 4, true.  But, the defense actually forced a stop and punt - which Isiah Burse fumbled.  The resulting short field led to the touchdown and the 11 point lead (assisted by a defensive holding on a 3rd down stop).   Fuck you you dirty pirate criminal.   I mean, Oreo line is OP.   I mean, Oreo line is OP.   Yeah, totally am used to it.  I can't say I agree with these views, but realistically how bad can being super Christian really be?  I always figured I'd rather have Tebow preaching than Big Ben raping, Rae Carruth murdering, or Adrian Peterson/Ray Rice beating.   Von Miller you really should move to Denver.  That commute must kill you.   No kidding, right?  "I play for my lord and I play for my teammates".  Seems fine to me.  	105

 Damn glad to meet ya'!   This is a clear violation of the FLSA. Even if you weren't missing work for military service, as long as you work or attempt to work 40 hours a week, your employer must pay you your full salary for that week.  It's important for your employer to understand the potential downsides of what they're doing. Exempt refers to an exemption from regular hourly pay and overtime rules. If they violate the specific rules for exempt employees, they lose that exemption.   That means that they must pay you overtime for all the hours you work over 40 in a week. And this can be applied retroactively. Which means you can sue them for back pay for every hour you've worked over 40 in a week going back to the time you were hired.       Here's a question for you and for any resume adviser or job counselor debating how to put a McDonald's job on a resume. Do you think that the people most likely to read that resume, hiring manager or HR person or whoever, has never heard of McDonald's or is unaware of the kind of work people do there? Do you think that if you manage to present your burger-flipping and toilet-mopping duties in a sufficiently good light that you will convince any professional hiring person that your job there was any more than it was?  As others have noted, a fast food job can be a positive thing. It shows you can show up on time, learn new tasks, follow instructions and get along with your team. If you try to jump it up with crap like "strategically upselling menu items", the best you can hope for is that you'll make the resume reader laugh. It's more likely that your resume gets thrown in the "no" pile for rank stupidity.     Yes, that seems like an odd spot for it.       I guess I-Con is never coming back, is it?  **sigh**     There is no bathroom!   You can still search for stuff. I usually listed to Fresh Air when I'm mowing the lawn.  Still, they could make it easier to pick the stuff you want to listen to.      Have you tried the NPR One app?   Just remember, snitches get smooches.    Deadlines to apply for our summer programs have all passed, but definitely look into our [High School Research Program](http://www.bnl.gov/education/program.asp?q=111) for next year.  Our [Summer Sunday](http://www.bnl.gov/stakeholder/summerSundays.php) program is starting soon. It's for the general public, so you could come out and look around and see some of the work we do here.   I agree. The new one came out last week and I devoured the whole thing in a day.  Now I have to wait another year for the next one.   Nicholas Colasanto who played Coach on Cheers passed away after the end of the show's third season.  The fourth season premiere episode,  dealt with Coach's death as well as introducing Colasanto's successor, Woody Harrelson, as Woody Boyd.   Here's the link from the NIH  http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1854883/        Your company will tell you how you should treat them.   If your company treats people with professionalism and respect when they leave, letting them work out their two weeks or simply paying them for that time and sending them their way, then you give your proper notice as expected.  If they abuse people who are leaving, berating them and not letting them serve out their notice, then you don't give notice. Alternately, you can give two weeks notice on Friday, but plan to start  your new job the following Monday, expecting them to fire you. That way your can honestly claim you gave your expected two weeks.    So the GOP is basically saying, "We don't care if young people vote for us ever again?".          Hey, you fucked up. It happens. You didn't understand your limitations so you overpromised and underdelivered. That's not a bad fuckup for someone just starting out.   Just make sure that:  1) You understand what you did wrong  2) You know why it was wrong  3) You know why you did it  4) You know how to avoid it in the future.  Otherwise it sounds like you did some good work there and you don't want to throw that out the window. It might not be a bad idea to call up the place you interned at and see what they're going to say about you when you give them as a reference.  Good luck.   Makes sense. He can already see her house.   The details vary from state to state, but generally, to collect unemployment you must have worked a certain minimum amount during the "base period" before you file.    In almost every state, the base period is a one-year period: the earliest four of the last five complete quarters of the calendar year. For example, if you apply for unemployment in March 2015, the base period would be October 1, 2013 though September 30, 2014.  So these two months could be added to your base period credit if you file for unemployment in the future.   If they're not withholding taxes, then you're responsible for paying the employer share of FICA/Medicare unless they plan to slip you money under the table for it.  And while you may not be eligible for unemployment now, after only working there for two months, that work should be added to the service time with your next job so you'll be eligible for unemployment sooner.   That's...odd.   Are you sure you were 1099? Did they withhold any taxes from your paychecks?    The main downsides of 1099 vs W-2 are:  1) Self employment tax. As a 1099, you must pay 15.3% of your income for FICA/Medicare. As a W-2, you pay half of that and your employer pays the other half.  2) Unemployment insurance: As a 1099 worker, you are not eligible for unemployment insurance. As a W2, you are.  3) Employee protections: As a W2 worker, you have much greater protection for things that might happen on the job. A lot of these protections (sexual harassment, FLSA, etc.) do not apply to 1099 workers.  If you're reclassified, you'll get some of these benefits back and your employer will have to pay. Plus they'll probably have to pay a fine and cover other costs, like workman's comp, that don't apply to 1099 workers.  Good luck!   Maybe still could be. Just because the hack came from this dude's IP doesn't mean he's actually the hacker.      Sounds kosher.            I have a good feeling about it. Marvel has shown they can do something a little different with each picture.  I wouldn't be shocked if I ended up liking it more than Age Of Ultron, although that's not such a high bar to clear.   "Fuck you, Uwe" - All of us.         A bazillion to one.      God Bless America!   It's all in the reflexes.   Melon farmer!         Noodles and gravy?         There's a little more information [at this link](http://easthamptonstar.com/Government/2015605/Uber-Pulls-Plug-Ride-Service-East-Hampton-Town)  A taxi law adopted several years ago and revised in 2014 requires cab companies to have a town business license, licenses for each of their vehicles, which triggers inspections by town ordinance enforcement officers, and licenses for individual drivers.   I think if there was an easy workaround, Uber would have found it. Seems as if each individual Uber driver has to have a business license, a town license and an office. I suppose a bunch of Uber drivers could club together and get an office, but they'd still need all that other stuff.   That doesn't fit Uber's business model.   According to the article, the owner of the office space must be the owner of the vehicle. I'm not sure what that would entail. A partnership amongst all the East Hampton Uber drivers? I don't know if that would be kosher.            I don't understand this. Would it be more brave to kill them with artillery shells or a couple dozen M117's from a B-52?   Why not? Great oaks from tiny acorns grow.      All the upvotes for you, my friend.   [Not The Bees!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1GadTfGFvU)   Yes, that's what I heard.   I expect they'll junk them, except maybe for some of the effects shots.    Could be a few people coming out of the woodwork now that the story is out. Predators rarely stop at one victim.               How powerful does a computer have to be these days, really?  For a while I've been thinking about a tiny PC to replace all the devices connected to my TV. A full Windows PC would be great because then I'm not beholden to what apps are approved on what devices  and I can play any file in any format from my NAS.     It's unclear. The article mentions that Robbie will guest on The Flash and will guest on LOT, but won't be a series regular.  I could see maybe Garber/Stein being the main science guy, Robbie/Ronnie off doing something else and so we only get Firestorm in some of the episodes.  Could also be that someone else is the other half of Firestorm somewhere down the line. That happened in the comics too.   How would this make you look bad. If your boss is letting his subordinate pressure him into bad decisions, that's a pretty shitty boss. That should reflect terribly on him.    Call the mall management. Tell them what's happened. That you're owed money. You were fired illegally. And the store owner has enlisted mall security to harass you.  Then tell them that you'd prefer to resolve this quietly, but you'd be happy to go to the media if the situation isn't resolved. Be calm and polite, but firm.    I hope so. I wasn't too excited by the trailer, but I think that's something they just threw together quick for upfronts.    It's unlikely that any corporation would attempt to enforce these low level non-competes and it's even less likely that they would hold up in court. But that's not the point.  Your average, hourly worker doesn't know that these agreements are generally garbage and so they create a chilling effect on employees, who will be less likely to leave and seek new employment because of the agreement they signed.  Plus, low paid workers don't generally have access to legal representation if some vindictive business owner tries to enforce one out of spite.   When I first read through it, I thought that Garber had said that, now I see it's not clear.   "Robbie and I will be joined on the first episode of the (next) season of The Flash, and then we'll see what happens," Garber said. That leaves Amell not joining CW's Legends of Tomorrow universe as a series regular, though he's expected to make an appearance.            Zart!            Depends on what your company policy is. You and/or your supervisor might be disciplined in some way.  Either way, they have to pay you for all your time worked.                  	84
 I'm 20yo female who didn't really do any sports until I got to college (I did some swimming in middle school and marching band in high school, but nothing else). I started rowing in college three years ago and now I'm really dedicated and committed to that. But I've noticed on and off the water that I have less body awareness than my teammates. For example, when doing weights I can't tell if my spine is neutral or bent without a mirror or a partner. Are there any exercises--either physical or mental--that I can do to help increase my body awareness? This subreddit seemed like a good place to go but feel free to direct me somewhere else.   Wooooow   I think you're forgetting the mental skills required for this sport. Yes, all sports require mental skills, but rowing--particularly racing--requires some serious mental focus and toughness. Pushing your body to its absolute limits is not something your brain really wants to do, and it takes time and attention to really hone the necessary perseverance and to shut down that prominent self-preservation instinct. Don't neglect that in your considerations.    That's alarming   	4
 Looks like your taste isn't too dissimilar to mine, so I'm just going through my "Watch it Again" list to give you some suggestions (some have already been recommended):  * 30 Rock * Futurama * Freaks and Geeks (I know it's been mentioned already, but worth another mention) * The Inbetweeners * New Girl * The Wonder Years * The Walking Dead (except for most of Season 2) * Derek * The IT Crows * The West Wing * Black Mirror * The Fall * Lost * My Name is Earl * Malcolm in the Middle * The Office (UK)   This kind of Hollywood studio greed ensures smaller VOD operators really don't have much of a chance, killing competition and helping piracy to thrive. And this could ironically lead to the studios' downfall - only the strongest operators survives, and a monopolistic behemoth is usually created as a result (ie. Netflix, or iTunes for music, Amazon for eBooks), someone that will end up having all the power to set the (licensing) terms in the future!      Still cheaper than Foxtel   Welcome to the club!   I've found my Blu-ray buying rate halved since I started using Netflix (been geo-dodging for two years now). I had been wasting a lot of money on crappy movies, just because I wanted something new to watch. Netflix is now my source for all things crappy.   The money I've saved have gone into going to the movies or buying movies that I actually like, thus reducing my pirated download rate as well.  	5

 "The most watched sports related youtube channel in the world baybeh!"   EXTREEEEEEMEEEE   All racing tyres will have that problem if you abuse them. locking up the tyres will have a detrimental effect, no matter which racing series as it introduces flat spots. It also will always cost you time. Hence it's better to have a smoother, cleaner driver, rather than balsy, locking up everywhere. Sure it looks much faster but in reality it will always be slower   Not just that. They do it in record time as well.    Exactly. But the commentators were too much trying to put WEC over that I cringed. WEC by itself is an entertaining sport, without needing comparisons   To be honest, I only caught the last 5 hours of WEC last weekend and seeing a Porsche so far in front, it was like watching F1  What annoys me tho was the commentary  "**More people are now switching from F1, because of factors such as sound**"  But most of the Diesel LMP1 car was totally SILENT, and usually the ones with the awesome sounds were from the GT class.  "**More and more F1 drivers seem to be coming to WEC**"  But that had been always the case.   "**WEC provides wheel to wheel actions!**"  From what I understood that only happened up til nighttime, where the Porsche pulled a lead, and most of the overtaking after that happens in the pits    Senna won't able to finish that race. The engineers revealed that he was carrying a slow puncture that they discovered after the race had finished   This was suggested by Bernie and immediately put down by EVERYONE. The drivers have sponsors tied to the team they are driving, and or bring sponsors to the team so logically this wont ever happen   She was backstage a few weeks back I think visiting    Bork wins from Rollins. Reigns vs Bork. Reigns win. Sheamus cashes in. We sympathies with Reigns.       I remember Massa spinning twice in that race due to seemingly overly sensitive throttle pedal or something.  A pity that Heikki can't make use of his pole, and slip down the order while his teammate dominated      Bourdais nearly won in 2009 with Peugeot altho he was dropped by STR later that year   They upgraded. Just that the upgrade was in the name of "making the engine more reliable" so they do not need to use any tokens. Look at their rear engine cover and you can see a bump. This is actually a larger cooler for their ERS system    I know about the upgrade, but they are using a new power unit, aka their 2nd out of 4   No pre boob job bella?   Maybe a context was needed. I was referring to the Mercedes breaking the Red Bull domination in F1 and dominating themselves  Porsche has just broken a 4 year Audi domination *cross finger that they do*   They were totally sandbagging /s   Porsche is doing a Mercedes this year.      left for toyota iirc   Merc have a new engine in Canada as both Canada and Austria stresses the engine quite hard   Thanks. To be honest I only saw a video of them talking in German and I just take the caption for granted as what they are actually saying      Fox Sports Asia that holds the South East Asia broadcast license usually have  - The broadcast  - Pit Lane Camera  - Dedicated Onboard  - Track map  - Live Timing  All which can be streamed at the same time from their website. So yeah, F1 has already offered all of this, but it depends on the broadcasting rights holder in your region   Was he fired in that segment? from what I remembered, Vince were just saying that he won't be rehired by WWF. Either that or I have a bad memory   "Any sound is just wasted energy"  - LMP1 engineer when Hybrid was first introduced   This is waaay smoother than the one Red Bull did   I am actually glad that Keith Apicary is not chosen  It was just a PR stunt, and choosing him would mean one less slot for a more appropriate person   Lots of reason  - Weather. The FIA need to make sure the race avoid the most extreme weather that the hosting country could achieve. This could be the Monsoon in Malaysia or the extreme summer in other places  - Tradition. Some races are traditionally in that date. For example Monaco is always near the end of May, and would usually be at the same weekend as the Indy 500. Canada would always follow it next, and then LeMans. If they can help it, they would usually make it that way. I think Brundle was saying that the FIA would usually assign the Monaco GP's date for the year, and work out the rest of the races from there.  - Host circuit calendar. They also need to see if the host circuit will have a free slot. Can't really plonk the race in a weekend where the host circuit has already agreed to do another race can we?   Note that there are teams, like Mercedes, that does not even have a nose that long.   Some teams chose for a longer and droopier nose to pass the crash test, and with a pointy nose like that it certainly beat the purposes won't it?   Thanks for the heads up. I was pondering of buying the game since I thought I had missed the pre-order chance, i'd just buy it cheap during the Sales.  but meh. I'll just let this one skip. I haven't finished GTA IV and I doubt I would even finish this one   WWE also unmasked Alberto El Patron right? He was wrestling with a mask in Mexico   That being said, the Bentley did win in Silverstone last year, and totally trumped the opposition there.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOqyM2jNqqs   they liked it personally, just not openly or in a way that make they look like they are promoting it  Having it in the promo would mean Botchamania getting a free promo by the WWE, which they wouldn't likely to do.   Oh Pirelli is more than capable of that. Remember the Russian Grand Prix?   While it's not mentioned, the PS4 wheel does work on the PC as well   I have the Momo, G25 and now the thrustmaster T300RS. All were awesome in their own ways. The momo still feels like a real racing wheel til today   A steering wheel is different from a control stick, which emulates a controller   Licensing. It's either PS4/PC or XboxOne/PC.    Yeah, so Pirelli will be introducing plastics tyre to spice up the season in '17? /S   Flash paper iirc   Vickie was supposed to come out earlier, so Eddie had to improv. Hence the line   THE SHOCKMASTER!   Christian during his "One More Match" run with Randy Orton. His foot was under the ropes and that's how he gets his rematch   My white shirt is now tropicana coloured. Awesome video   better makeup and much more push in her bra   The Rock can't actually wrestle or bust more than 5 moves   He was queen controlled by Melina IIRC, and got into legitimate heat with other wrestlers for that. IMO some were concerned that Melina's decision was not what's the best for him   Something like last night is still okay. but a title run? They would hardly want it since they would need to bump on a daily basis, and both have serious injury problems before. They won't agree on that      https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3I-iUL2IBn4   Fibreglass maybe? The one in WM where Dean was thrown looks like fibreglass/wood   People said that WWE gave the WWE championship to the best wrestler in the company at the time, it would be given to TAKA   He was also interviewed for other series as well (Monday night Wars? I forgot) so he's not really blacklisted, just ignored   Mercs?   Cena was supposed to face Rock at Wrestlemania. CM Punk challenged Cena, if Cena lost, CM Punk will get that shot instead.  So we have a PPV Tier match between CM Punk and Cena on fucking RAW. It was so good because they busted out moves that they would never do. Punk with a piledriver and Cena with a hurracarana (kinda botched but that's beside the point).   It was awesome because storytelling wise, they both want to win, and they are digging deep using moves that one would never imagine them to do    Gotta disagree. I live in Asia, which is quite far away from US as you can get, but during AE, most of the males in the schools watches wrestling. Heck, majority of the grown up does as well. And at the time we did not even get RAW on free to air TV (only Superstars that have RAW recaps, RAW was on cable) but that did not stop kids from emulating The Rock, Stone Cold or Undertaker.   What's more amazing was WCW was virtually non existent, even tho they were as large as WWF at the time. This is due to WWF's reaching out to oversea countries knowing that they would get more money while WCW which was bankrolled by Turner decided that they don't need outside exposure. And even without the Monday Night Wars, WWF still manage to gain mainstream appeal in my country.  The day I knew about the Monday Night War and WCW was when they were showing the episode of the Radicalz debuting on RAW, and a local newspaper that had a wrestling column suddenly talked about that defection      This make me wish that Kidman is still in shape, and join in the feud as well as the high flyer   What's next? Fake Kane? Fake Undertaker?   To be honest that looks better than Reigns's   R-Truth = fucking gold   "What is Hugh Morrus doing in the Impact Zone?"   They do teach them different styles, just under the radar. IIRC the performance centre would call up trainers who will teach the talents other styles like Lucha Libre, but adapted to the WWE style, aka safer and won't lead to serious injuries in the long run   Royal Rumble 2001   Dolph Ziggler Hair Pork Ramen   https://soundcloud.com/mahmoudi-ahmadinejad/pit  Some of the radio messages on the Formula1.com site during the start of the race   1 - They stopped using the awesome JAVA based live timing because a few browsers (like Chrome) is stopping JAVA support in the future as well as smart phone browsers do not support JAVA. https://java.com/en/download/faq/chrome.xml  IMO the current live timing on the browser is good because not only it works for desktop browsers, but it also works for phone browsers as well  2 - The Live Commentary tab also has radio messages, some which are not even shown on the telecast  3 - Depending on who shows F1 in your country, they would also carry additional channels. For example, Fox Sports in Asia has a dedicated Onboard, Pit Lane and Track Map for each race that is accessible from their website   According to Brundle, its the downforce, aka the air will push on the wings and slow down the car during lift and coast    Only JBL and it's a running joke. Cole and Booker usually never do this   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlun5cDeKpk index=19 list=PLqIVmFaHA8Bqh943Ahszn02PsfOiF_2TJ  WWE shows his SSP from OVW in this video   The BWO  WE ARE TAKING OVEEEERRR   Quote #54   "A fan hit Goldberg with a cardboard Star of David" - The Wrestling Observer Newsletter: October 16, 2000   Took me a while to remember that Goldberg is a Jew and this is ironic   Quote #160   "Chris Jericho's final WCW match was 7/21 in Peoria, IL in a tag match teaming with Eddie against Kidman and Mysterio. Before the match, Jericho said that if he got pinned he'd leave WCW. Misterio than said everyone already knew it was his last night in WCW. (After the match) all four hugged in the ring. There were fans in near tears, as was Jericho. Kidman started a Jericho chant. Jericho said that he was overwhelmed by the response, but he still thinks that Peoria sucks" - The Wrestling Observer Newsletter: August 02, 1999   The Curtain Call WCW style      My name is Finleh, I a LUUURRVE to fight!   I prefer a codec pack like CCCP or K-Lite + MPClassic. Better hardware rendering support, so it's lighter on your processor and faster than VLC  Also you can turn on web interface for MPC, and access it with your smart phone's browser at IP of the PC running MPC:13579   There are also games on the Xbox One that I want to play but are not released for the PC like Forza. Kinda looking forward to that streaming feature. Hopefully it will be as good as Steam In Home Streaming that I am using to stream games from my gaming PC under my desk to my Surface 3       It's the YET-TAY.   Is that the big gold belt?   I'm pretty sure it's not due to PG that WWE waters down their product, but due to Mattel which pays them a lot.   or X-Pac without the X-Pac heat   Yep. He's only over due to his awesome abilities. But he's sub par on the mic   Hideo's english is progressing nicely it seems      Hi Alex,   First off, how different is driving an F1 car compared to a LeMans/endurance car?  Does it effect how you approach race? How do you pace yourself?  And how is it racing in a car shared with someone else? Does some leeway has to be taken when either drivers have a disagreement?  Thank you   Same thing happened with Codemaster's racing games so it's not really a Project Cars only issues. I usually set my location to UK-London even to I live in Asia to see any online lobbies   game EXE runs on one window, and a standalone telemetry exe runs on another?   Those games that were based on the original Gmotor/gmotor2 engine (rFactor, GTR, GTR2, GT legends, rFactor2, Shift, Shift2, etc) has an easy way to know where to brake when you turn off the racing line. Look for the darker patch of tarmac on the road. That's your braking point.  In any cases the patch is similar to the other color of the road, start braking where the rumble strip starts   The track cutting penalty is getting on my nerve when I'm racing online. But yeah, in terms of physics there is nothing much wrong with the PC version   For Assetto Corsa:   http://www.racedepartment.com/downloads/hockenheimring-1988.5143/update?update=8302     It's actually the PS4 version of the game, not the PC  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glaP1oBJWao   Checklist for Teddy Long  - "Hold up playa"  - "Tag team match"  - "wrestler vs Da undatakah"   which means 6:30pm here and 7:30pm in Japan. FUCK YEAH I CAN WATCH IT AFTER WORK!   This is the logical step for Kunos. The success of Project Cars must have something to do with this decision. I'm actually happy as this means that the PC version will also have more contents.   IMO though, the console and the PC version will not be quite similar. Modding would certainly be a PC version only. Most likely the console version will be a separate game altogether?   ISI did this with the F1 Challenge game, where the playstation version differs highly from the PC version   http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x2sjlye  Yep. Sorry about that. I forgot that Hamilton repassed.   Raikkonen passed Hamilton when they encountered a slow Williams, and then promptly spun.    Not really that aerodynamic but good lord it looks awesome   Not many, and most likely only high end. There are not many devices that utilises Thunderbolt currently hence the lack of it on many mid range devices.  With 3.0 sharing a connector type with the Type-C USB and the ability to use external GPU, I foresee it being slowly picked up much more in the next few years.    It's an Intel thing. and since Apple uses Intel's processor that's why you always see it on an Apple.   For PCs, third party manufacturers like ASUS and MSI usually does not see a reason to include it on mid range motherboards and this helps keep the motherboard price down.       He praised it in Malaysia, which was Petronas home country. It was PR speak at the time   Japan '05 for me will always be the highlight for F1 in between '00 and '09   Due to TV changing the colour IIRC. McLaren uses dayglo orange during their Marlboro years because then it would look red in the TV broadcast and pictures   AKA McLaren Honda this year   IIRC the world feed is 50FPS (They are using PAL). Note that NTSC countries will be showing the feed at 60FPS, without the extra 10FPS advantage.   They are the new Diesel and Shawn, and I see them breaking up in less than a year.  If you want to see real bromance, Farooq and Bradshaw was much more believable TBH   Debut him in 2 weeks and let him cost KO his rematch against Cena.   He has no qualms with Vince, just the way Vince's wrestling works      Multiplayer on Project Cars is like the Formula 3 race at Monza yesterday  http://www.autosport.com/news/report.php/id/119247   My mistake   I am so sorry   Lack of grip. The right tyres are too cold and hence there is no confidence.  The SLS is heavier as well, needing a longer braking distance   Yep. And I don't look down on assist users. but right now it's a quick way to weed out the ones that are overenthusiastic. Nobody want to crash or ruin other people's race. But they lack the experience and judgement of people that are used to this methodological and patient racing. I mean if I grew up only playing Need for Speed I would be impatient and rash too.   He was never in TNA and if he is, WWE would make sure he can't use the same basic theme   for newer games that is highly likely. For older games, unless a patch comes out, no   Because Dirt Rally is an early access game that can only be played with STEAM? right? RIGHT?   Indeed. But when it leads to a better overall experience I don't see a problem. With ABS and TC on, a player would more likely to do the "Dive on the inside move" knowing that they would stop in time without thinking of the other car  Without both assist, one need to think where to brake without locking up, and when to throttle out without spinning, hence anyone that wants to stay on the black stuffs tends to be more diciplined   had a hard time reading some due to camera shake. Could you scan them instead OP?   Less than F1 definitely. Spec cars means cheaper series. Heck, one of the teams are even sponsored by KFC Indonesia   Ambrose and Reigns = Shawn and Diesel   They are willing to if they are not a direct competitor. NWA is mentioned many times, since the current NWA is basically an indie instead of it's old self. NJPW has been mentioned quite a number of times, especially when Brock is in the ring because NJPW won't trouble WWE in the states. ROH has been mentioned, as well as their tapes used/borrowed for WWE documentaries.   jacobpower-bomb her then   HUD Cycle button  You can also have the temp on you steering wheel if you don't want it on the HUD   Yep. First time driving the SLS and so was quite careful. Not to mention TC and ABS were off so I was extra careful hence underheating the tyres   what we did last night was set the ABS and traction control off, and have a 30 minute practice session. Once people realised that both were off, they left, leaving only legit racers in the server      Jibril is also known as the angel Gabriel in the western world.  IIRC Mikail = Michael. Have no idea if they translate the other 8 angel's name as well tho   Yes  Example: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCfET5-7NTo   Lita and Edge   14, but damn that was a good drive. He reeled in 3 **personal best** laps on the three last laps of the race. Considering that he was running low wing and the track is damp, that's remarkable.    In the live timing, what is the Red Square beside some of the names?   Similar to Sebastian Bourdais in '09 and Hulkenberg this year. They signed a contract to drive for other teams before they were confirmed for F1, and they are fulfilling their contract   Last week we see Rowland having to catch up from the back, this week it's Jazeman. Deja vu for Fortec   Sadly his performance is similar to his F1 performance   VIPleague stream is working but lagging quite badly   http://i.imgur.com/bVk5RL2.jpg  It has a cable that runs into the rear of the laptop.    unlikely. 8 twisted pair cables over an NIC is not really plugging directly into your PCI express lane speed. And it's faster to use STEAM In Home Streaming instead of trying to concoct a solution that would have been already created if it's feasible  	139
 My own fear of failure. I feel like I'd rather not try than try and fail, it seems...   Oh wow this would definitely take a lot of stress off someone's shoulders. I know it would for me, for sure.   This is awesome. You're a great person for encouraging this texter as well. You even told them about accent walls! Fuck yeah! Their babygirl is gonna have her blue room, fuck D!   Songs: Ohia is great!   I like white denims earlier stuff. Can't conment on recent albums cuz I haven't heard them. :)   Awesome inspiration! What a great song and tattoo!   John Malkovich.   Thank you! These are all very helpful! I do have experience painting digitally but it's mostly cartoon stuff. I'm not very confident about making money with my art, sadly. You can check some of it out at http://faunus-crypticus.tumblr.com if you're curious, though!   I'm actually planning on registering for WWOOFing and have even emailed some farms as a start! That is exactly up my alley, though idk how I'd work out paying off bills while I volunteer. I'm sure I could sublet my apartment but I'd need to have some sort of income while I do it as I don't have and disposable income currently.    Oh, I don't have to leave the country; I just want to leave here. I don't think the military would be a good fit for me, however. I more just want to look into moving into the wilderness and maybe do WWOOFing or something :)   I saw this on her Instagram! Great work, can't wait to see the finished piece!    Hey there. I just discovered this sub and I'm not really sure how exactly I can change my life but I'm looking for any and all advice/help in getting things together.    First a little history:     I grew up never really knowing what home was. I was abused, put into the foster care system and bounced around from 14-18. Never really knew anything about my father until I was 16 and reached out to him.    My mom is a third generation American (Irish) and my father is an Israeli (his mother was born in Yemen, from what I understand). I grew up poor and without anyone teaching me how to be self sufficient. I had to learn all of that the hard way. From what I understand, my father was wealthy until he was arrested in 1988 for drug trafficking (he was the head of a local cocaine ring) and left us with nothing (the government seized everything and my mom tried to bribe him so he severed completely with the hopes that we would contact him later in life).    Basically, for me, I just want to run away. I'm sick of the life I have and I've often dreamed of just getting out and living somewhere I can just garden, hunt, fish and live in the wilderness away from most people. I'm sick of having my income go mostly to keeping a roof over my head and bills, yet still not being able to afford to pay off my debt because I practically break even every month.    The catch is that I don't have the skills to really live off the land and want so badly to be taken on as someone's apprentice (so to speak). I want to learn it all. I want to get out of the city and work my way up to being completely self sufficient. I'm at the point where I want to just drop everything and walk away from my life. I virtually want to commit suicide of my former self and just find the happy, free person that is dying to get out.    Maybe this won't reach anyone that can help me, but even the slightest suggestions would matter so much to me.

They basically had their own behind the scenes puppet show going at all times.   Greek Salads....  Or pickles.   I know they're considered healthy per se, but only eating the same thing is really unhealthy. I actually *did eat them every day* during a really hot summer that nothing else appetized me because hot food repulsed me and I lost an unhealthy amount of weight.   Gotcha. Just misinterpreted the question as emotionally destabilize rather than literally. My bad!   Some places slice the steak for you; it depends on the place. Usually they'll cut it for presentation but they'll let it sit to settle the juices a bit prior to slicing... I work at a (relatively nice) restaurant and we serve our NY strip sliced usually.     I eat my steak as rare as the chef will allow it and only like mine seasoned with garlic, salt and pepper and MAYBE garnished with butter   I guess I didn't read "destabilize" as "cause war" and more so just felt that this pope is pretty rad and has made a lot of statements encouraging compassion to a lot of groups that had received a lot of hate (gays, evolutionary biology, etc) that if he was **assassinated** it would cause a lot of outrage....

It's okay, spunky monkey has a stick up his/her ass. While it's possible for the dog to have been flicked with water; it's doubtful the dog would stay in place while that happens to him (even if OP is holding a treat, a dog would think the flicking motion was OP throwing it and likely stand up). Also, we can't see the other side of the vest so we don't know if it's not drool or rainwater (it was sprinkling where I live today) or anything.

 Damn man, that has to fucking suck. I'm sorry.   Who wasn't?   Sigmund Freud often gave cocaine to friends and family as party gifts. Why? Well, because he loved cocaine.

  Market-beliefs are first and foremost humble ones - they stem from the idea that people on the ground know their own lives better than even the best intentioned of central planners somewhere.  This is a dogma, which has very little evidence backing it up. The dogma works assuming perfect and instantaneous flow of information along the whole market, along with completely rational participants. Neither of which exists in real life. Not only that market based investment is inherently myopic. Nobody invests in stuff which have a hazy chance of success fifty years down the line. Only the government does that - it is called basic research. Yet, without basic research technological progress is impossible. And this is just one example.   This is ridiculous. How is "categorically destructive"?  Because libertarianism would lead to a whittling down of multiple government programs, from infrastructure to SNAP. For people already on the edge, removal of often one government program could be disastrous.   I think the lifetime cost also includes the initial cash you pay to buy a slave. Including that, the lifetime cost of slave ownership outweighed the wages you paid a worker.   What is the problem with a piecemeal regulation if it is good? And as regards incentive, you may be different, but in many cases people have to work extra jobs just to make ends meet. The majority of American poor are actually employed, and there are significant populations of homeless, unemployed Americans. A place to sleep, and food to eat is a basic animalistic motivation, when you make people work two to three jobs just for that - then you cannot just wave it away as   In some cases, it's money.  You are confusing **need** with **incentive**. Two very different things.  And as regards, basic income it is still a fringe idea. Not a single mainstream candidate supports it, and yet without it libertarianism is categorically destructive.    I did not know that. Really interesting - thanks!  So, to imply the minimum wage must at least be equal to or higher than the maintenance cost of ownership of a human being. If not so, we really have not progressed since 1865.   I am really curious to the overwork Americans put in by *consent*, rather than being motivated by the material concerns of paying the rent and putting food on the table.  Consent, by the way, is a big buzzword - as it should be. If someone, for example has sex with another person who is really drunk it would count as statutory rape in almost every jurisdiction. Because of impaired consent. Given the massive wealth stratification/ income inequality, we have to then ponder how much of the consent given by workers is fimpaired? To have a perfect libertarian world with perfect consent you would thus need to give people the liberty of saying no - i:e a social safety net. Which is exactly what libertarians want to dismantle. Given this inherent contradiction/paradox, tell me how can I take a libertarian seriously?   But it still is 20% up since this January 2015. The larger problem with China is to find a stable parking spot for middle class savings. Because the volatility of the stock indices is fueled largely by Chinese middle class investors plowing their savings into stocks after getting burnt by real estate.   Three strikes and you are out - that's my policy. I am super busy in grad school, and I frankly don't have time for anyone's incompetence.  And the issue here, as the OP himself points out is not incompetence. Very few people are actually incompetent. Most supposedly incompetent fellows I have witnessed are plain lazy and don't just care.   In the current political climate that we have created in USA, even if someone tried to outlaw slavery people would jump up and say,"This will be negative for the US business environment"   Really great job! I am OK with LaTex  but big tables still trip me up.   Why not Tom Corbett then?   I don't get this guy Rand Paul at all. Some days he talks real sense like when he talks about Kalief Browder's solitary incarceration at Rikers's, and somedays this.   And obviously we have to remember GOP Swiftboating Kerry   There is support for that theory. It is believed that Rhaegar Targaryen kidnapped Lyanna because he believed the child was phophesied.   Not completely true. In fact it is often categorically false. Ritwik Ghatak had a much wretched life economically than Salman Khan. The poor, struggling artist is almost a cliche - from Poe to Van Gogh. If material wealth is a prerequisite for art - then Bollywood would be filled with auteurs.   You should have added a bit more bombast in your sentence for better effects.  	15
 It's pretty tiring to be mindful at all times, but it's useful to be able to identify when you're going through a stressful situation and become mindful at that point.   Also it's pretty great to become mindful when you're in a relaxing situation like sitting on the beach - everything becomes that little bit more satisfying.   Oh, and sex.   "Former publican Chris Parsons said: "I assumed it was made from the local waters. I wouldn't buy it anymore and think it is a complete and utter con.""  http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-cornwall-33175395   I watched a documentary once about how the drug testing system works. You have to tell them exactly where you're going to be at all times, days in advance. I think one of the people interviewed said they had to work out where they'd be on certain points of their long-distance runs.  I'm surprised this doesn't happen more often.   Acid rain, never heard of it since.   I've read the power of now and whilst I appreciated it, I feel it can be a bit intense and "out there" for some people. Instead I'd recommend The Untethered Soul by Michael A Singer, I find it's a lot more accessible and also is structured in a far more logical way.   Yes. The price was high but I was desperate.    If it's a one off send me a pm and when I get home I'll try get hold of it through my university for you.      I'm starting to wonder if the reason a lot of guys on Reddit complain about never getting a girlfriend is because they're so damn fussy.   The difficult truth is that you need to stop yourself thinking these thoughts. It's something that I've had to do myself and I know that it's immensely difficult. But this sort of thinking becomes a habit and it will become worse and worse if you don't take a stand now.   From your meditation you've hopefully gained an awareness of what's going through your mind, you need to use this awareness as much as possible to identify these bad thoughts.  The next (and most difficult) step is to take a leap of faith and stop letting yourself think these thoughts. I know how difficult this is, and part of me was scared that I wouldn't be "prepared" for bad eventualities if I did this. However, taking this leap of faith will set you free completely.  When things get tough, think of it as habit training. You've trained yourself into bad thinking habits, you can train yourself out of them too.  Good luck!   Hahaha, what a story Mark!    I wonder if the company would have changed their name is 9/11 happened two days earlier.   I'm a uni student and the only reason I take that seat is because I'm doing the exact same thing! I remember being inspired to do this by Dave Vitty on the Chris Moyles show when I was a wee teenager.   I imagine everyone in gonewild district will be using throwaway accounts, therefore fake moustaches and glasses everywhere.       I don't believe in God in a traditional sense, but I'm open to the idea that there could be something out there akin to a God. It could have personality flaws, it may not be powerful enough to be aware of everything it created, hell, it may even be that our universe is a kids toy to teach baby aliens the meaning of life and death.  I simply accept the idea that there are so many things that I will never understand and maybe a God would be one of those things.  	16
