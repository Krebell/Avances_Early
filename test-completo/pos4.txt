 If you don't mind me asking   How much were they though?   I did that for my dc's and it's amazing. Good call. Thank you. It doesn't hurt that they are gorgeous boots   Definitely about to pick those up. Thank you   And they're quality? I've never bought vans snowboard apparel. Can I trust em?   Yeah my local shop seeks last year's model for cheap so I might get em! Thanks   How much did you get them for?   How many seasons have you gotten out of them?   Yeah my local shop does a huge last season's model sale so I'm gonna head down in these next few days. I ride dc's now. I got a good 3 seasons out of em but they're shot. Thanks for the advice   I am beyond jealous  	10
 I'm glad a total internet stranger seems so confident in my abilities! :)  I will say, depression has a way of making you feel like you are the worst person on earth (by "you" i mean like a general "you"...not you yourself... ha). Topped with the insecurities I already had... it is not a pretty sigh over here.    Makes me feel better to hear that from someone.  The doctor was like "You should feel great in a week!"...Uhhh...I do not. Not even close!  	2
 While Tanking during Titan EX with my FC, getting repeatedly blasted off the platform by Landslide. Needless to say, my FC thought it was hilarious as I screamed myself into oblivion on Mumble every time.    Yes, welcome to Final Fantasy! :D My first month wasn't as progressive as I have college and work, but I do enjoy what time I can spend in Eorzea. :)    Damn, getting blasted off the platform during Titan EX must mean you're REALLY unconscious, then.   I absolutely hate speedrunning and will refuse to do it unless I'm partying with people that I am friends with. I like enjoying the dungeon for what it is regardless of how many times I have to run through it (unless it's AV. Fuck that place).  Granted, I understand people's want for speedruning, but I don't enjoy the process of speeding through something.    I never thought about it until now, but I myself am now anxious for a train to be patched.   10/10, made my day.   I play through Steam often, and the Mog Station simply registers your copy of the game under Windows. If you purchase the game through the Steam client,  it should give you a CD key that you affiliate with your SQ account in order to lock it to that account.  As for buying time,  you can just pay though a credit/debit  card through the Mog Station as well. You should be able to redeem your time card in the same fashion. Purchasing a copy of the game would be necessary though,  as others have said.    Those players are all asshats, wow.   	8
 I'm so excited for you! I wish someone would ask me out. If you're east coast, your have two hours. Will expect an update.   It's just how you view it. Embrace the whitey in yourself and all will flourish.   Fuck that. I praise the sun and take in all it's rays.   Thank you for this post because now I know what I'm going to make for dinner!!!  The answer is.......   French toast! Wanna come over?   I've become a little more apathetic. I think this has to do with my ability to get 3.0 GPA (minimum) without trying AT ALL. I'm very good at playing the system, and my college is not hard in general. So, I really don't care about walking out of class or skipping or giving a fuck about what I wear, how people perceive me, how many friends I have on campus, etc. If i feel it's not worth my time, i won't show up. If I think a professor is ridiculous I won't show up or I'll let my voice be heard. I guess this is part of adulthood and synonymous with independence.  Also, I learned it's okay to think outside the box and your opinions actually ARE what professors want to hear. I've been lucky to take a handful of classes with professors that let you (and expect you) to be free with your thought. Some of the things I wrote seem like I'm high out of my mind, but it's really just me digging deeper and making connections that I've been forced to not look into in other classes.   I'll spin it tomorrow   I've been Into exploration as well and started metal detecting. Great way to see the outdoors and float around to new places/hidden gems in your area.   It's PEMDAS. Parentheses, exponent, multiplication or division (left to right), addition or subtraction (left to right).   The answer is 6. Parentheses first, then division and multiplication left to right. 2*3=6   Have you talked to your doctor about antidepressants? They often help with anxiety all together, rather than a quick fix like xanax. Same with your focus, really will help on a low dose.  I've been on my share of antidepressants that have changed my levels of anxiety. I've found when I'm on a pill that completely removes anxiety, I am unproductive and boring. Anxiety kind of forces me to multitask and complete things fully and quickly. I manage every little detail which is why I do so well, esp at jobs.    Yeah I just got off from work and headed to some more spots today. Got too messy in my work clothes and shoes so headed home. Going big tomorrow on my day off though!!   I am definitely getting better each time I dig a plug! Luckily where I've been has either been my own property or land that's otherwise not well kept so I can hide my mistakes for now!   $loan $150.00   Thanks for the welcoming. Went out today for 2.5 hours, multiple place. just kept finding beer can and rocks! and 11c! I will not be discouraged, heading to the beach tomorrow!   Having trouble, can send you something via paypal if you have one.   dark net   garbage men   Yup. End of thread.   Been there. Look at /r/opiatesrecovery  If you can't do it alone colt turkey, try lupe or kratom. If that doesn't work, get suboxone from a sub clinic.. Of course rehab is a possibility.  Get yourself to a counselor as well because issues aren't just on the surface.  You'll be good, stay positive.   It 100% pays off being nice! I will go out of my way for any nice guest and do it with a great attitude. For a complaining guest, I'll try my best to make you happy because its my job! And, I love the feeling of turning a rude customer to a nice grateful customer. I usually will not be overly nice though. And next time I won't be as happy as I could be.    smell taste hear see touch  physical contact is necessary. Plus, helen keller could get by, so can  i!   I've had mine dismantled and can reassure you.... it is.   I will dismantle your heart.   ARE YOU VOLUNTEERING YOURSELF AS TRIBUNE?   That's awesome. Artificial sweeteners have a similar effect on the GI system.  I want to try a chip.   Omg your answers are in sync with my brain. This is a hard breakup but I support your decision.   This is down the road from me. Always makes me smile when social media posts it around.   Chelsea smile..   Oh and do you want to be my boyfriend?    Did you tell her what you told us?   What is your name? I feel like I dated you... (See below)   I want to live as minimally as possible but feel like this is a big step moving out. Thanks for the encouragement though.   taco bell veggie cantina bowl. my stomach right now... send help...   Worked for me once. I didn't really care either way though and my boss was a great pal.   it's like soured milk chunks   Canada's fries-- fries, gravy, cheese curds.   definitely recommend yak and yeti! WOuldn't go to Be out Guest. Just mediocre.   Ya I graduate in less than a month. Freaking out but trying to remain optimistic and stand my ground. Focus on right now, rather than finding a career for the rest of my life.  As far as motivation, maybe you'd like to talk to a doctor about getting on a mild antidepressant. I don't think you're necessarily depressed but rather in a rut going through an existential crisis.   Because I'd want to save it to make pinky promises.  And if want my left ring finger for marriage.   Probably a pinky on one finger and the ring finger on the other.  So 200k.   I think you new to do some soul searching. Explore, spend time alone, spend time with strangers, travel, take up new hobbies or volunteer. After this, Make a list of your positive traits and what you find you like or value.   If you don't have a job, get one even if it's not a "career" and work hard at it to make you feel confident. Plus it takes time away from dwelling on your problems and puts your energy into something else other than anxiety.  Think about your "virgin" situation. Do you want to have sex for yourself or because you think it's what you NEED to do (just like you NEED to get a job out of college)? If it's the former, go right ahead and pursue that but know it's not going to solve any problems.  Other than that, someone once told me to not worry about what you're going to do to create happiness for the rest of your life but rather focus on what makes you happy in your current life. (I probably and wording this wrong)   Good luck I've been there and overcome some of the problems that you've mentioned but still right there with you on others.     Whole situation is stupid. Don't pay her and ignore this train wreck of a person.   The song I don't mind. The intro video is what kills me. It's so long and pretty old now. They should just have a scene at the bar as an intro or something.   exercise. That's all I got.   amazing. As I graduate with a B.S. in Business Admin, I'm realizing I am more intrigued with a career along the lines of social work. Any advice? Are there any entry level positions you think I'd be qualified for without any social work background right now? Or, any similar career paths you think would suit someone interested in helping people, dealing with children and human science?   Yes, that's why we keep having sex.   Gotta cut him out soon.   I'm a girl and would probably do it but not get into a relationship. It's his choice and I'm not the only one to blame.   No this sounds weird as hell. Not normal, tell her to stop.   Probably cost efficiency.   http://www.parenting.com/family-time/home/top-10-safest-cities-america-2014 I actually live near next to 6 and think 7 is also a great place to live if you like heat.  You can get a job where I live as a waiter anywhere. 1600E is $2000+ America? That'd get you a pretty good apartment here with at least $500 spending money. But this obv changes by location in the US. I'd say the average where I like is $1000USD, so maybe 800E.  Up north, you don't really feel the racism. Down South, it's a little different. I wouldn't really say it's that racist or segregated, but people do have different views than what us in the North view difference races. What you hear about shootings happen, but no, it's not like that. There's rape and mugging but it's not something we should be known for. Inner cities you'll find more or it.  Don't live in Compton or NYC.     No. My mom used to be just like yours and when I was too young to go to the bathroom myself, I remember her putting enough TP to clog the toilet on the rim of the seat. Now I just squat depending on the cleanliness. Most of the time if it looks clean and well maintained, I just sit right down. I don't care.  Once a year I put a cover on just to reminisce about my childhood and because they look fun.   Thanks for posting, you're giving me a lot of courage. Italy seems much more doable than the other places I listed. Sounds like a challenge planning and going alone but I'm certainly going to look into it.   $loan $30   He's probably the happiest guy I ever met, never once yelled and just so helpful and friendly overall. I for want to let him down or disobey him because he deserves respect and doesn't need my hassles or bullshit.    I just grab coffee in my car.   Spray poopouri or another perfume/febreeze in the toilet before you go and flush.   Sounds like you have an anxiety disorder. Maybe talking it out with someone, even a friend, will help.   Probably testosterone and ability to build muscle easier.   Why don't you ask the people you're living with how they feel? Id rather have the 3bdrm but I'm not living there.   Kinda just want to get high and converse.   It's much, much more acceptable than calling guys "boys." Just a synonym for me. I don't have a problem with it.   Wow this is extremely interesting. If I go to my psychiatrist and ask for your script, what do you think would happen? Would I need to do a tap? We've tried 3 antidepressants and I'm not doing great, I wonder if he'd give it a try.   Girl. I can be a grill if you're into that shit, oh yeah bb   You probably don't want to hear this but I 100% think it should be required to go to a community college for 1 or 2 years and take some gen eds right out of high school, then transfer. It saves money and gets you focused, both with the college atmosphere and your future wants and needs. If you wanna be away, you can always get an apartment, rent out a room near a college and be on your own.   Lmao thanks that's the one  	65

 I cover my teeth with my lips, and I like to flick my tongue against the head whilst he fucks my mouth. I usually grab his bum, or play with his balls as well.   Focus on his enjoyment more than focusing on whether you'll hurt him. If you do accidentally nip him, it won't be a complete turn off...just continue going with a little more care but don't let it put you off!    Ours is "watermelon"....something I'd never say randomly aloud. For slow down, we use y"yellow" however I rarely use these, and have never had to use my Safeword.   The only time we don't use a word is if I'm gagged, we then use the key method...he puts a set of keys in my hand or my teddy paw to hold and I'll drop it if I need to stop playing.    Well done! That's great news :)   I say "you're very welcome" and it takes the sarcastic twinge off of the end, however I do sometimes Say "no worries!" Because it seems a bit more friendly :)   Buy some new lingerie, or something new to make me feel more feminine. Send some pictures to my OH and he makes me feel so much sexier.   Doing my nails, or trying a new make up skill makes me feel better too     I'm in the same situation, I am sick of the day to day routine. Mine usually is wake up at 7:30, start work and then finish at 3ish. Then eat, bath, sleep. The only way I enjoy my days are if I'm distracted from the reality. I spend all week wishing it was the weekend, and I absolutely hate hate hate my life routine right now. In the past few months, I have been diagnosed with severe depression, and I suspect in the next week I will be diagnosed with borderline personality disorder which explains my lack of enthusiasm these days. Some days I want to just stay in bed!  The beat way to deal with it for me, was to have things to look forward too! Spending time with my boyfriend, buying a new book to read which would distract me for a while, even buying my favourite foods helped me. Don't sit around alone, and try not to think too much about why you are the way you are. Do things you enjoy, and when you feel down, go and spend time with your family, play music or even go for a walk with some music in your earphones.   Good luck, and PM if you need any more help :)   Some people realise what they are when they are even younger, but may not know what the correct term is. For example, I knew I was submissive when I was younger, and most of my older partners had also known they were Dominant when they were around 16/17...It's just a feeling.   It's similar to when a female child feels she is in the wrong body, and has the wrong gender...she knows that from a young age and although BDSM isn't as extreme as that, it still is very similar. I knew I was submissive because I naturally enjoyed having no power in the bedroom, and I hated taking lead...I prefer to be a follower :)      	7
 At my high school last year a sophomore and his girlfriend had sex in the sound booth in the back of the auditorium during the middle of an orchestra concert   I'm a teenage girl, band nerd, animal lover. Sometimes I'm funny idk pm me if boys   You too! Good luck sista!   Cool cool, I do too but I doubt it'll happen too haha   I play trombone and euph, you?   annamarie225  plz   My name's Anna and I'm birthday is July 3rd. :3   Thank you(: And I'm 15.   http://i.imgur.com/iulMBEj.jpg 3   Counting Blue Cars - Dishwalla Ribs - Lorde Team - Lorde The Girl - City and Colour Post Break-Up Sex - The Vaccines   I realized how replaceable I am. Every one of my past boyfriends has gotten a new girlfriend within 2 weeks of breaking up with me or me breaking up with them. They'll act devastated and like it's the end of the world, but then just forget about me. And it's really ruining my self esteem, you know?   "You can go lay back down" to my dog who woke up to follow me around the house   And I like driving home with one headlight holla   I'm Anna, I'm from Michigan, and I'm in marching band and my school's robotics team. I need to meet new people so message me :3 my hobbies include talking about my pets behind their backs and sleeping   Low brass is obviously superior   Me too..   My best friend's dad was an all star QB on the Michigan State football team. He got a master's in general math and a couple other maths and sciences. He is now working for a lawncare company and makes about 40k a year.   Ah /: And I'm in Michigan where the winters are really harsh. I just kinda want it short because it would be easier to handle and the back of my hair is pretty much fried beyond repair.   Lol, that's one of the best parts!   Oh my gosh. I am in LOVE with the first one you sent me, it's adorable (and would be so much easier to handle lol) Thanks dude!   I like that too, and I feel like it wouldn't look horrible if I got too lazy to straighten it lol   I'm getting a haircut in a couple hours, and I am going to have to get it short due to really burned hair in the back of my head, and I'll probably need it thinned out a bit. I kind of want shorter hair anyway because right now I'm getting bored with my plain haircut. I need to hear suggestions from you guys because I don't know how short or in what style or color I want. It will be difficult to decide because I have a round face which tends to not look super great with short hair. Here's a picture for reference: imgur.com/lLiTVM9   Hey I have that sweater   EVERY SINGLE DAY.   I've thought about this before. I would take a bus or a train to Chicago, and try to find a cheap apartment, and make a fake ID if I had to, and get a job wherever I could, and I could just live happily by myself.   http://i.imgur.com/0pc9I19.jpg   Brand New, Lana Del Rey, Marina and the Diamonds, Panic at the Disco, Bruce Springsteen, The xx, Bon Iver. Just to name a few.   annamarie225   Now St. Claire is kicking our asses which sucks because we're the only band that did visuals so   Thank you! I just finished. It was rather hellish but ya know    My marching band will be in the Thanksgiving Day Parade in Detroit, and it would mean the world to us if we won first place. If you have a minute, please go on clickondetroit.com and vote for Waterford Kettering in the side bar for the battle of the bands. We worked really hard on visuals and it would be amazing if we won first place. Thank you so much 3   I tried this and kinda liked it tbh, it didn't sting for me...   Thanks dude   Oh my God, I'll be there. My poor penguin has been neglected for years.   can i have your dress plz omg. really though where did you get it? I love it   http://i.imgur.com/3MnFHot.jpg hi   http://i.imgur.com/qiTFzXs.jpg Geometry makes me cry   My jack russell terrier mix also has that, but she doesn't gain a whole lot of weight from it, she's just a bit chubby. She has more of the problem with shaking and always being thirsty.   I thought I was the only one who had those   ITS BACK   I can't pick just one, but Trapeze Swinger by Iron and Wine is up there   This song never gets old omg   Southeast Michigan    Heck yeah!   That was pretty accurate lol   15 F MI  Kik: annamarie225   http://i.imgur.com/3MnFHot.jpg plz omg   I'm a boss ass bitch bitch bitch   Why the downvotes? Ouch.   Well there goes my plan   Annamarie225 15 F omg plz    I'm way ahead of you, brotha.   #truebeauty   "Be a brave woman!" Lol easier said than done ;P But sometimes he sits with a couple other people and they simultaneously listen to music or read and I vaguely know one of them so I might just say one day that I didn't feel like sitting with my other friends and he's the only other person in my lunch that I really know. That sounds like a decent plan but omg I'm already stressing out    That's so bold but omg I love it.   thanks riley you're great xox   10/10 WOULD SMILE AT. Rly tho I really wanna sit by him at lunch but it'll take a lot of courage tbh   I'm very introverted too, and I really like that picture. I've seen it but I read it pretty often because it reminds me of a lot of things. But someday I', gonna force myself to work up the courage to do that.   is it wrong i'm tempted?   yes i like this      Not with that attitude!   That's true, I'll ask them about it next time I see them.   I didn't live just with him, I lived with him and my mom until I was 3, then I saw him a few times a year and talked to him on the phone a lot because he had legal issues, but then when I turned about 11, I saw him almost every day and was with him a lot of the time. He passed away two years ago right when I turned 13. So I don't know. I'd be nervous to talk to my psychiatrist about it because I don't want to sound like one of those melodramatic teenage girls that think they have bipolar disorder, even though they're just hormones.   I might, I have a follow up for them in a couple weeks. I used to have a therapist but I don't go anymore because it was so expensive and I hated going. And I'm not sure, it's possible, because my dad had really severe bipolar disorder. My mom is concerned that I do, but they usually don't diagnose teenagers with it.   Are those song lyrics? Because wow that was adorable. Can I message you? Cuz let's be friends. I feel like you're someone I could talk to.   That's actually really amazing tbh   That made me really happy...   Most of my friends have aspergers actually, so don't feel bad. People who have it are actually very interesting. But I'm already on antidepressants for other reasons and they don't help much with my social issues, they just make me feel happier in general, and when I take them I have more motivation. But unfortunately, I'm still just as awkward. But thank you.   I wish my school had more clubs, because I agree that it would help me a lot, I'm in band but there are so many people that it's a bit overwhelming, and I'd really like smaller groups or clubs.   That made me smile.  	71
 it aint really what it is but it do   shit starts spinnin'   This article was great! I don't post much, but I just wanted to stop in and show my appreciation for an article of such quality.  It is truly unfortunate that static recompilation is difficult to use more extensively in emulation due to the inherent complexity of code.  Very good read though, it's clear that you put a lot of work into the article. Thanks for sharing.   MD MoCo ent reporting. Nice spot   Get this superstitious bullshit off world news. Stories like this contribute nothing to this sub and you should feel bad.   Theories of Relativity and Special Relativity by Einstein. Nobody even came close to understanding gravity before this. The 20th century is great.   Can someone please explain to me why anyone even cares about these statistics? I don't understand, why is it significant if less women go into a field one year compared to past years? And why does it belong in this sub?   Competitive SSBM ent here. Sick controller.   Does that just mean that no one has been able to prove it's either P or NP-complete?   If this is OC and you're really asking, good luck man.   Razors. Those fuckers are expensive   How about "pick one programming paradigm and stick to it"?   As human beings, I feel like we strive to attach meaning to inherently meaningless things. It's sad, really. The way humans live life today is just an endless circlejerk with some escapism thrown in for shits and giggles.   99 bottles of beer on the wall, 99 bottles of beeeer... etc.   Long term medication is a scary concept. Ive been on medication for around 7 years (growing up) and I can assure you it changes your personality. In my case, I feel overwhelmingly neutral whenever a conflict comes up. I have trouble feeling anything at all and as a result I'm terrible with women. I have never had a girlfriend even though I'm outgoing and have a decent amount of good friends. I am very critical of things that I don't agree with and I criticize those that don't understand certain situations like I do. Stay away from medication in the long term if you can. This sucks.   Alcohol can often make things harder instead of easier. There are some medications out there that will make you feel better, you just have to go to a therapist/psychiatrist to get help. Falling asleep with so much pain is terrible. If you have someone in your life who is willing to listen, talking to them will definitely help. It is the main reason i can keep from being so depressed, along with my medication. In any case, good luck with your life and try to decrease the drinking to weekends if you can.   Speaking from experience: try to sit down with her and tell her how you really feel about this and any concerns you have. In any functional relationship, both sides listen to one another's concerns and make their thoughts and opinions known to each other.   The way I think of it: if you give people a chance, they will give you a chance. You may find that when it's their turn to reciprocate the kindness you showed to them, they will show that they care about you.   The world can be hard to understand. I've tried making the best of life by setting short term goals for myself like attending every class at college and going to every shift at work. It's still very hard but at least I know I'm on the right track. Setting goals can help.   Sometimes you have to be the one to reach out to others in your life. Maybe if you try to reconnect with others, you will be able to feel better. This is what happened with me and having people around me helps a lot.   My Pots on Thought lol   Just let go of her, she's holding you back. You can be so much more.   Depression is unique because there are so many ways we experience it. I am currently in the same boat as you. Most of high school I was stepped on. You just have to keep on living. Friends were a valuable resource when i finally found some real ones. This community is also great because we can let our feelings be known and not feel so alone. Sorry if this post isnt really making a point, I'm just greatful this subreddit is here as much as you.   If you're in college, try to find things in common with people in your classes. I was depressed before and now I have a small group of friends with common interests and we all support each other. It is very hard at first, but just try to chat people up. At uni most people are nice and will listen, unlike high school. I wish you luck, hope my advice was ok.   I understand, i do this with pop tarts. What i do to help is study for 30 mins then take a break and eat. Then repeat. I'm a uni student by the way.   Yeah i wanna know too but im lazy and google is so far away. Marylents unite!   I would imagine they are attempting to move heavy objects, given the crane. I hope this clears up any questions you may have had.   uptokes for tries lol  	28
 I almost drowned when I was 3/4 years old. Until then I loved swimming but it took 3 years for me to even get out of a kiddies pool after it and any attempt to take me for swimming lessons would result in me screaming the place down.  I've never properly learned how to swim, I can do basic strokes but not for long periods of time and can't tread water. I'm still wary in deep water, it freaks me out if I can't see the bottom.   The sound and feel of polystyrene rubbing together. It's the worst part of opening packaging.   Writing anything in pen. I'm not sure about anyone else but if I have to write for extended periods of time I end up with a massive stain on the side of my hand.   I curl up under my covers, plug my earphones into my phone, stick on Spotify and shut out the world.   Although I'm with you on supporting the mages (Meredith be crazy!) Orsino is not the nice kindly elf he appears to be. During All That Remains it becomes apparent that he has been at least assisting Quentin with his "research".    I second your opinion on Vivienne. On my first playthrough all I could think was "what a condescending, snobby cow." As such I missed a lot of her dialogue because I never took her with me.  After playing again and actually listening to her I realise just how hard she had to work to attain her position, and although her and my Quiz will never agree politically, I can still respect her opinion.  	6
 I can understand why someone would be hesitant. I was always very against taking medication personally but I hit a very rough patch this summer and saw how horrible I'd been acting. At that point I was willing to admit that some medication would help me.   all of my mental illness has come from times where I was alone. I've had deep existential self loathing from times where I been more or less isolated. I don't think I like myself very much and it can be very frightening.    It's awful, it gives you hope, but you know what's happening and you don't want to be alone.    I was to put it lightly a jerk to everyone I know. I was condescending, cynical and sometimes belittling. I've worked on it a lot I lost a lot of good people in the mean time. I've found the medication that I've been taking takes the edge off of my "chip on the shoulder" attitude.   I think we both "liked" each other for a long time before we actually started dating. We were best friends because we were both sort of a little outcast from everyone else in highschool. We were both art types so we got along really well.  I asked her out at the end of grade 11 and she said no, so I went on and met some other girls had a really fun summer, I come back the following fall and she hijacks me in her car and basically tells me that we're dating "before any other girl snatches me up." We lost our virginities to each other and I seriously doubt I could find another girl like her.  We dated for two and half years, she was someone who I felt like I could be in my own skin around. We went to school in the same city and spent almost all of our time together. Then my depression and anxiety started, I ended up taking it out on her (jealousy, anger, general insecurity) which wasn't fair and she deserved so much better. It's difficult to show love and trust to someone when you don't love and trust yourself.  She fell in love with someone else and now they're dating. I'm still pretty wrecked up about it, and the worst part is knowing that it's all my fault. I moved home because I need to get my head sorted so we don't live in the same city anymore. We still talk every few weeks over skype, but I feel incredibly insincere and guilty. I miss her every day.     I spent about a year on a high horse because I started using biting ice cold rational to criticize basically the way most people go on with their lives. We entertain and distract ourselves to death and I refused to participate for almost a year. I tried to better myself because the only other course of action was passivity. My rationale was supported by a lot of academic research and personal experience. Having this depressing hypercritical worldview did make me quite the elitist because no one else would bother to do the research and work that I'd done to achieve what appears to be so evident.  I'm not sure what to make of my ideas anymore, they seem true and seem like the right course of action, but they isolated me from all my friends and loved ones. I've now decided to tone myself down so that maybe I can be happy again someday.   Pushed everyone away and definitely not for their own benefit. I thought that everyone didn't want or need me. My ex left me ( she'd been my best friend for several years) and I've now moved across the country to mostly isolate myself. I'm starting to make friends here now but I've had months alone.   I'd definitely participate. This sounds like a great idea.   Me and my ex broke up in May of this year. We'd been dating for 2.5 years and had been friends for 5. We were each others first relationship. It was a bad split, I was dealing with depression, we weren't communicating well, I took my depression out on her and said/did somethings that were highly inappropriate, I'm pretty sure we were both feeling trapped.   She broke up with me and I really tried to keep a persona of being cool and alright with the breakup, that I was doing alright and moving on. The truth was that I hadn't been sleeping or eating and that I started seeing a therapist to get my depression under control. My ex started dating someone else a few weeks of us splitting up (I'd had my suspicions about this guy before we split up)   Over the summer I did the shitty ex thing and sent her an angry letter telling her she was selfish and that she never cared about me in the first place. This came from a very unhealthy place and I regret sending it a lot. I was really miserable. Anyway, I decided I wasn't going back to university in the same city as her and that I was going to take the year off to pull myself back together.   When she heard from friends that I wasn't doing well she called me and asked me point blank if I was alright. I told her straight up that I wasn't, that I'd been dealing with a lot of guilt about how I'd treated her in the last few months of our relationship and how wrong headed I'd been. I told her that I'd been dealing with depression and that I hoped it helped to explain some of my behaviour.   Since then she contacts me fairly often and we have long conversations like the kind we had when we were together. I also find it odd that she regularly calls me on a Friday or Saturday night and talks with me for a whole evening. A few weeks ago she texted me 4 times and then finally called me because she wanted to send me a christmas card.  There were problems in our relationship, there were things that I wasn't happy with and obviously there were things that she wasn't happy with, but I feel that our relationship fell apart as a mix of hitting a 2 year down point and my depression. This time last year we were talking about moving in together. I think a lot of what happened was us failing to take our relationship to the next level. There were times where I was almost ready to break it off with her too.  We still talk, I don't know whether she's still dating that other guy, I don't think it's appropriate for me to ask. I'm doing my best to step away from the effects of the breakup, I've made new friends in the city where I'm living now, I've gone on dates, I've been seeing my therapist and have been making progress with fighting my depression.  I need to work on myself, I need to meet new people, date new people, I need to drive back my depression. But, at the same time, I'd be lying if I said that I don't have any sort of small idea that me and her might try again some time, when we're both at better more mature places in our lives.   The only thing is I can't be sure that she isn't just contacting me out of pity. Would you keep in contact with someone just because  She seems to be fairly genuine about things as they are. I guess I'm just looking for a bit of input on why you think someone would stay in contact with their ex the way she seems fairly adamantly trying to stay in contact with me.   TL;DR: Had a bad split with first girlfriend, she left me and started dating fairly soon afterwards. Months later we are trying to stay friends and she is definitely making an effort to keep me fairly close. Why do you think that is?    You need to get somewhere safe and away from him. I'm sorry, I'm sure you love him on his fair weather days, but what he is doing is not okay whatsoever. For your own well being.   I do it all the time, in fact, I'd go as far to say I've created a charming, funny and extroverted character that I use as a buffer between myself and the outside world. I smile, I joke, I flirt, I wouldn't say it's manic like in bipolar disorder, but it's a falsity that I use to protect myself.  At work today a customer told me that I do such a good job making people happy, that I'm a positive for everyone that comes into the cafe I work at. I spent most of my day fantasizing about killing myself.   Sorry, this probably hasn't been helpful at all.   Yeah, that's unacceptable behaviour on his part, make it clear to him that if this doesn't improve than you're gone. Accusing you of cheating without the smallest piece of evidence is ridiculous and dramatic and you should tell him that.   Yeah.. I think relationships are a little more complicated than you make them out to be. Not to say that his behaviour is acceptable, it isn't, but I think you're stretching a little bit.   Should she be careful incase his behaviour doesn't improve. yes. Is it helpful to tell her that this guy *will* destroy her life, probably not.   I will agree with other posters that your boyfriend's behaviour is unacceptably invasive, but at the same time I do, as a man, sympathize with that kind of insecurity. I'm of the school of thought that most single males have less than platonic goals if they start showing interest in a girl who is in a relationship. It's an easy assumption and more often than not it's right.   All that being said you're boyfriend is obviously not just being the normal level of defensive, he's taking it way too far. You shouldn't have to show him all the past of your electronic communication if you don't want to, that's a boundary that you've set.  I'm not usually one to dish out the "break up" advice which is often given ad nauseum on this subreddt, but if your boyfriend doesn't seriously take your feelings on this into consideration and continues to freak out, I don't think you'll have many more directions to take. If you've communicated your issue with his behaviour to him, and he hasn't tried to compromise to achieve a healthy middle ground than it's probably time to move on.  This is coming from someone who's ex-girlfriend actually left me for a "guy friend" so I hope that I'm a tempered response.    Seriously, you're both wrong, you pushed him, he hit you in the leg. Learn to not fight like children or don't be in a relationship, simple.    People with depression, particularly males, often do exhibit increased aggression or irritability. If OP's bf is depressed his behaviour isn't entirely out of place.   I have isolated myself. I've moved across the country to live with my parents in a city I don't know. I am alone, the only people I talk to on a semiregular basis are people from work and my exgirlfriend. She left me for someone else, I was a shitty boyfriend, I was desperate and afraid. I've told her about my depression, and how I wish I'd known I was depressed at the time. I wish I could talk to her more often, or open up and be candid with her, I really miss her. I know I won't find someone as unique and special as her. I feel cold and alone. I imagine this is a similar feeling to being caught in the wilderness, knowing you're going to freeze to death, but having no way of stopping it. I've tried so hard to get out of this, I've been exercising, writing, seeing a therapist, taking medication, I just can't make it stop. No one values me, I think my ex only talks to me out of pity, I'm unneeded, replaceable, and unhappy.     I miss you, there isn't a day that goes by that I don't think about you. After all of these months of putting together the pieces, like an expert piecing back together a plane after a horrible crash, I finally have a good picture and can say that this was all my fault. If I could see you now I'd hug you and tell you how sorry I am, and that I don't really know what to do or who I am right now but I'm trying anyway. I never imagined that we'd end up this way, or that I'd be where I am right now. I know you've found love with someone else and all I can think is how much you deserve someone who's better than me. How were you ever supposed to love me when I can't love myself?, when deep down I'm so fundamentally twisted up inside. You have a good heart to have ever been able to love someone like me. You probably don't think too kindly of me these days, the only person to blame for that is me.   These days I don't know if I'll ever be able to stand on my own two feet again. We talk now and then, but I don't know if I've let on how beaten out of the race I really am. So many "what ifs" run through my brain everyday; "What if I hadn't gotten sick?" "What if I'd been more patient" "What if I wasn't scared." We both wish I could just leave it in the past and move forward, but I just can't. I'm too afraid.  I miss coming home to you, I miss watching movies, just talking in the shower and going for walks through the nice end of town. I miss how we'd snuggle close to each other before falling asleep, how your legs and arms would get cold so you'd curl around me. I miss when it was just me and you under blankets in the backs of cars and listening to songs from the 80's. I miss you calling me late at night to ask if I wanted to go smoke cigars in the rain and then waiting for me to kiss you.   All of that seems so far away now, like a dream, like something that never happened. I've lost you, you're so far away now, and I'm so afraid that I'm losing myself too. All I feel is guilt, anger and remorse, it's only fitting that I'm the source of my own misery. I'm cold, bitter, and a worse man than I was before, maybe I've always been worse. I really hope you find real happiness, and no matter what happens to me, if I don't pull myself back, and can never stand by on my own again, it's not because of you.       Yeah with pop music (rock, trance, top 40, any of that stuff) they'd be somewhere between bored and revolted.   I've started smoking over the past year because, A) I really like the flavour, it's relaxing and lets me think alone and B) I know that it might possibly kill me one of these days. I've never self harmed, but this is a much more passive way of doing so I suppose and that seems to suit me.   I'm actually a he, and was dating a she. I was feeling very well at the time, I was beginning my last year of high school felt like I finally had something to look forward to. She was my best friend and I'd started to have feelings for her. We were together for two years, I became depressed during my first year of university, started hating myself, didn't treat her as well as I should have, this was before I was diagnosed. She broke up with me, and with good reason. I've since started getting help and am trying to do better, but I'm in no condition to be in a relationship with anybody.   Sounds a lot like depression to me. I've been diagnosed and can really relate to the completely not feeling anything, as well as the rare anger episode. For me, the anger feels like something other than the nothingness so it's difficult to control when it does happen. If you're feeling this way please go talk to someone and find some help.   Well from my own personal experience I was experiencing a brief period off feeling normal when I started a relationship with my now ex. I had my most severe episode of depression and was entirely undiagnosed. It really did screw up my relationship, I've done so many things that I regret. I don't know how I'd even go about starting a relationship now.    I ended up resenting my ex like crazy, which was a painful situation in and of itself, while we were dating. Coincidentally, she was really pushing for us to move in together earlier this year, but I said it wasn't a good time for multiple reasons. I'm glad that I didn't have to struggle through a living situation as well, just the emotional turmoil. I hope things work out for you.   I was just on the receiving end of this with my ex. She wasted my time for 2 years when I could have been meeting new girls and having fun in college. She led me on for a very, very long time and then ended up leaving me high and dry when someone else came along. You want to fuck someone up badly, do that. Please by all means break up with him, just don't be surprised if he never talks to you again.   I think death by spiders is fairly high up there on the list of ways I don't want to die.   Yeah, I find when I'm low I usually get pretty paranoid, especially about spiders. I actually slept with the light on for a few months because I was terrified there would be a spider somewhere near me. I've always had trouble with paranoia and falling asleep though, I'm a 20 years old and more or less scared of the dark, when I'm depressed anyway.   It's strange actually, me and my psychologist have both brought it that I probably don't know how to conduct myself in a normal way. I'm dysfunctional even when I am feeling alright because I don't know how to manage not feeling horrible. I've lived with depression so long that if I ever want to be healthy I have to learn how to conduct myself when I'm not feeling that way.   Yeah, that'd get you started. I really don't have any answers for you, all I can say is don't be too hard on yourself, don't let it consume you, realize that even if there is no grand scheme objective meaning that you can still apply meaning to things and people. Hopefully you come out of your crisis on the other end a more complete and aware person.   The best advice I can give is to be aware of your limitations and realize the potential you have. As a human you are limited and it's a difficult thing to accept. Best of luck.   Well it'd probably help if you describe your existential crisis a little more. I mean, what started it? have you been reading philosophy/literature?    I don't think it's something everyone goes through, I think it requires a certain level of introspection that a lot of people lack. There is a difference between that phase where you're trying to figure out what you want to do for a career and an existential crisis.   I will say that if you're having a full blown existential crisis then you probably won't find a solid answer to your questions. What you will find is a cornucopia of different thoughts and ways of conducting a life. Take what you find enriching and leave the rest  	30
 we really need a skunk vandagyre already, I'm pretty sure it'd be colored like a panda.  Don't you dare let me down JS, I saw how you fucked up the gold kau    I don't know what I did wrong??  You offended his dickish sensibilities   lol one time someone made a post about getting the island mystic avatar, and I went and checked it myself because for a stupid second I was thinking it was like a limited time frame avatar and I could get it too.    Well I remembered it wasn't, but I still got the avatar  xD   lol I'd do it haha  	4

Jkla wannabees   Tror du p fullaste allvar att Ebola skulle vilja sprida sig till DANMARK?!   This probably isn't such a good advice but anyways. When I told my dad about my depression he told me he'd be with me and help me through it. Bullshit. He avoided me, he disregarded it, almost stopped talking to me. I know my dad probably didn't know what to do in his situation but I feel like I hate him for abandoning me when he told me he would help me though it. It got much better between me and him when I told him a few months  after that it was just a phase. It wasn't.   BE CAREFUL WITH WHAT YOU SAY.   Hej, jag ppnade precis upp mig fr min pappa igr.

 What's the advantage of using this over chrome2phone?   It doesn't even have cut/move functionality...   Even so its pre-release, unfinished, leaked software. Your complaints are not "legit" because for all you know, the final product could be completely different.    Its for any aosp based ROM.    Don't rely on anyone. Everyone fucks you over eventually. And I'm only 17...   I've found that app2zip doesn't properly backup some data for apps, so I unless you're just backing up for the sake of not having to download all your apps again, I'd recommend titanium.    It works fine for me on an S2 w/ clockwork 6.0.2.something   Not at the moment. Reddit news and a few other clients can filter nsfw posts, but nothing like res functionality. Hopefully in the near future.    I think OEMs have to pay a fee to Google to include gapps on their phones. The Goophone Y5 received root and the ability to flash gapps a few weeks after release, thanks to the (small) community, perhaps the i5 will receive the same treatment?   $20 + a 10fps increase in average fps (according to tomshardware benchmarks).    yeah sorry not exactly the same price but thereabouts, and I'm willing to spend ~[$140](http://www.umart.com.au/pro/products_listnew.phtml?id=10 id2=247 bid=4 sid=99233) on it. According to /g/ I'd be better off getting a 2nd hand 560ti? (http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/geforce-gtx-560-ti-448-core-benchmark,3082-4.html) which go for around ~[$140](http://www.ebay.com/itm/ZOTAC-ZT-50303-10M-GeForce-GTX-560-Ti-Fermi-1GB-256-bit-GDDR5-PCI-Express-2-0-/170845275785?pt=PCC_Video_TV_Cards hash=item27c72c0689) also.   Would the [GTX 650ti](http://www.umart.com.au/newindex2.phtml?bid=4) be the better choice at the same price? (based on http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/geforce-gtx-650-ti-benchmark-gk106,3318-5.html)    changed the OP to a gtx 550. its a little better than the 7770 (http://www.hwcompare.com/11894/geforce-gtx-550-ti-vs-radeon-hd-7770/)   I'm really new at this. I'm not using pcpartpicker.com because I'm in Australia and the prices are a little bit off (total cost varies by ~$100 because of special deals and stuff on the website I'm looking at - umart.com.au if any Aussies are interested.)  Anyway this is what I have so far: http://i.imgur.com/xaUZ4.png  I know the graphics card isn't exactly top notch but I'd rather be underbudget than over, and I'm really really new at this so I'm pretty much clueless. Any advice would help.  Its also my first time posting here, so please let me know if I'm doing something against etiquette/subreddit rules.       ...because **there is no quality control/copyright filter**.   Cyandelta updater only downloads what's changed in between nightlies and builds a flashable .zip for you. ie, instead of having to download ~120mb .zips, you only have to download ~9mb between nightlies (obviously the longer you leave between the nightlies, the more there is to download). It makes staying on the latest nightly a little easier.   http://www.dummies.com/store/product/Android-Application-Development-For-Dummies.productCd-047077018X.html   Is the widget not working for anyone else?   Blacklist functionality exists already in Droidwall. To switch, press the top part where it says "Mode: whitelist".   Thatsthepoint.jpg   Not a universal one though. eg Apple iOS word processing app (Pages? I believe) can send to dropbox but not to Google drive (or any other alternative apps), even if they are installed, because there is no universal "share" list. The developer of the app that's being shared from has to manually add an entry for every possible app - which just isn't feasible with the amount of apps out there.   As someone with depression, this whole thread is just making me think "yikes" over and over again. I've been this person - and its arguably worse because I'm a guy and I'm expected to just be able to handle things.    How on earth are there still kernels being released with this bug?   On a good day: like seeing the world in black and white. On a really bad day: a big black cyclone inside and around my head.    http://www.flickr.com/photos/lukeboland/   That's because your phone is being mounted via MTP. Your **internal storage** yes, **internal, *not* SD card** is mounted at this directory ON YOUR PHONE: /storage/sdcard - **the Android OS treats your internal storage *like* an SD card because that is just simply how Android works.** Your **INTERNAL STORAGE** can be wiped by going into mounts and storage from the recovery menu and choosing "format internal storage" or "format /sdcard" (it depends on your recovery).   Stock Gingerbread can't.   Screenshot capability wasn't added to stock/AOSP android until 4.0. Any devices that are running versions below that with this capability have had it added through the manufacturer's custom firmware.   Perhaps longtime lurker is a homosexual man who was previously in a heterosexual marriage?   S2 has only been supported by AOKP since JB build 3, afaik. I don't think many people realize it has official support, since there are a lot of unofficial ports on the XDA forums and they all have quite a bit of following.   Why shouldn't there be? Nexuses (Nexii?) are arguably the easiest device to develop for.   Yup, so am I. The Galaxy S2's internal storage is mounted on /sdcard and the external sdcard is mounted on /sdcard/externalsd (or something similar).   When I had posted that comment they were only up to the Verizon Galaxy S3.    Data wipe/factory reset only wipes /data and /cache, everything else is untouched - the internal sdcard is stored on a partition called /sdcard, which isn't touched in a data wipe, mostly because the sdcard won't have any affect on boot or apps and almost never causes problems. That and the fact that clockworkmod backups are stored there, as well as flashable zips. It doesn't make sense to wipe it, there really is no need. If you really want to wipe the internal sd card, reboot into recovery, choose mounts and storage, and then choose "format /sdcard".  For your other problem - it sounds like a gapps issue. Do you have the latest gapps? (gapps from 2012/07/06 won't work with CM10 nightlies from 18/10 onwards due to the 4.1.2 code merge) - the latest gapps can be found [here](http://goo.im/gapps). Download the latest ones, flash them and reboot, and it should work fine.   Do AOKP have a build bot or do they build for every device manually? The wait for i9100 is killing me.   The problem is that WTF is subjective. To me, the last frame of this comic is very WTF. Maybe not to you, but what gives your opinion a higher value than mine or anyone else's on this subreddit? I'm not saying you shouldn't downvote - downvote the content you don't want to see and if enough people agree with you then it won't even make it to the front page (it is evident that you are in the minority here, given how many upvotes this submission has), but don't post stupid comments like this that don't add to the discussion.   Even phones with removeable batteries often have a hard reset button combo. My sgs2 does, and I much prefer doing that than a battery pull (the battery cover is a bitch to get off and on again)    Its not wtf until someone complains about it not being wtf. You sound like one of those people on 4chan calling everyone newfags. R/wtf was never good. There was no good days. You're an idiot. Find a good shock site and stay there.    Xda will be your best bet. If the builds on there are buggy than its just going to be buggy. developers aren't hiding secret ROMs that people on Reddit are privvy to. Its just how the development scene is for some phones.    Backup locally and upload to Dropbox...   I 100% agree with you, just pointing out that there is a (tiny) amount of merit to people saying AOKP is built on "stolen" code.   In terms of actual device code, for many devices (not all!) This is actually the truth. Official AOKP builds for the i9100, for example, are built entirely off cm code because they were the first to get JB to a usable state on this device.    The [apk](http://i.imgur.com/osZYS.png) is still there for me in system/apps (its called GoogleEars.apk) but the widget isn't available for me. Cm10 on the latest 10/18 nightly.    Clear data for the play store and Google services framework, reboot. That used to be an old trick anyway. Why are you afraid of downloading / installing the new apk? Its signed by Google - it wouldn't allow you to just install it over the existing store if it wasn't, it'd give you an error. If someone opened up the apk and inserted something malicious, they would have to resign it and it would give an error before installing (because the signatures don't match). Its 100% safe.   Either that or you could just download and flash the newest gapps package, which has the new store included: http://goo.im/gapps/gapps-jb-20121011-signed.zip   The development scene for the Desire C is unfortunately pretty much nonexistent. There seems to be only 3 ROMs for your phone, one of which hasn't been updated since August. http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?p=29295672   Root using this guide: http://www.theandroidsoul.com/how-to-root-xwjvh-android-2-3-3-rom-for-galaxy-s-i9000/  Then find an ICS/JB ROM that you like from here: http://forum.xda-developers.com/forumdisplay.php?f=665 Download and flash. Welcome to ICS.    [Inverted Gmail apk.](http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1797717)   Just an FYI, I'm currently getting 28mb usage for Nova.    http://www.reddit.com/r/GalaxyS3/comments/11c5nq/galaxy_s_iii_jelly_bean_where_the_fuck_are_you/   What does bitesms have that other SMS replacement apps don't? (Admittedly all the replacement apps are pretty shit, but they don't lack features. I myself use the stock SMS app.    Would love this feature. Have you submitted it on the github yet?   I'm talking exclusively in terms of the i9100  yup :) haha   There is no official ROM for JB for the i9100.   Adding a small amount of noise helps too, especially on the face where they sorta appear like pores from the distance.   Not at all. Is it merely coincidence that all ROM devs were floundering around after JB dropped until codeworkx posted his first CM build? And then suddenly everyone else's builds started to work... I'm talking exclusively in terms of the i9100, which has had huge hurdles in terms of hardware to get it to the smoothness its at at the moment. This isn't just bullshit... its fact. You can look at the git pulls and commits yourself if you'd like.   No worries. Builds include 4.1.2 code as of 10/10.    They changed to the model # instead of name (i9100 vs sgs2) for the latest builds - I think it was because people were flashing ROMs for the incorrect device (there's about 3 or 4 variations of the s2). Latest nightlies can be found [here](http://download.cyanogenmod.com/?device=i9100 type=nightly)   Previously (4.1.1) you needed two fingers to expand a notification. Now its just one.    Yeah I have. Its not the greatest but I'm usually on the bleeding edge of custom ROMs so I'm used to charging my phone every night, its decent for my needs (gets me through a full day of school. I can push it to 16 - 18 hrs but that's with switching data off when I don't need it. I only have WiFi on when I'm at home.    In all honesty, nothing to brag about. :/ I don't have any tweaks or under voting, just whatever stock settings Siyah has, and it usually gets about 12 hours with about 2 hours screen on time. I have BLN enabled but I think the impact on battery life for that is negligible.   I don't have that charger problem. The latest nightlies broke custom kernels, that's correct (I'm using an experimental version of Siyah) but this is not because of a failure on cm's part; they simply updated their code and custom kernels haven't caught up yet. The new code is Mali drivers, which means we are one step closer to having full butter (current 10/10 nightly is the SMOOTHEST this device has ever felt).  I don't know about dual booting. I do recall some people in the forums having issues. Here's a [link](http://sourceforge.net/projects/cm10i9100vsync/files/vsync_sysfs/) to the latest experimental kernel anyway.   You realize you can flash any kernel you like over any ROM? You flash the ROM  flash the kernel. Done. I'm using siyah right now. CRT off is here but its not toggle able. Its just on. I can customize my status bar plenty, what features are you looking for in particular? And I'm charging my phone as I type this on it, no probs here. What was the issue you faced?   Cm focus on stability and quality rather than quantity. Since cm7 was such a clusterfuck of options and crazy levels of customisation, a lot of users didn't even know about many of the features it had. Since cm9 the cm team have decided to focus their efforts on producing a professional aftermarket os - they're aiming to make it feel as though this is the software that should have come with your phone.  I prefer cm10's simplicity over what I personally feel as buggy, although "feature-packed". (Please note that I used ics AOKP from build 31 onwards until cm10 came out).  Besides, what features does AOKP have that cm doesn't?   Memleak is patched in latest nightly. Yay. :D   The cm10 nightlies work just fine... I just meant for the monthlies.  And pretty much all JB ROMs have used CM as a base, so the smoothness is thanks to them.   On the plus side, there's an app called [app2zip](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=scd.app2zip) that does exactly what you describe. :)   You should still be doing CWM backups in case something goes wrong with your ROM.   Still no intl SGS2 love. :(   Only thing of note is the ability to expand notifications with one finger (instead of two). Otherwise its basically just an incremental update to cater for new iterations of the Nexus 7.   Edit: as for custom ROMs getting the new update, cm10 is having the changes merged as we speak, and they should be in the next nightly (depending on your device). After cm merges the code, most ROMs will follow suit pretty quickly (AFAIK most ROMs are based off cm in some way)   Not to mention the S2!   http://db.tt/9NCsvWj7  That's a copy of the free version. Can't give you the paid one for obvious reasons.    Its not a Reddit sync issue, its a Google play issue.    Force stop and clear data for the play store and Google services framework. If that doesn't work, wipe cache, dalvik cache and fix permissions in recovery.    HAHA BECAUSE GAMERS DONT HAVE GIRLFRIENDS MIRITE? UPVOTES TO THE LEFT   Not really. What OP is talking about is full hardware support of Project Butter - which some devices don't have given that JB builds are unofficial for them with no source code from manufacturers. (Eg my sgs2 has jb but Project Butter isn't really in full effect because they haven't managed to port hwcomposer from ICS)   I think that's a Gnex exclusive.    I think he's more worried about the lynch mobs found on Reddit, such as SRS. I'm sure the commentor now has an inbox filled with hate about how much of a racist fuck he is because he used the word "nigger".   http://code.google.com/p/cyanogenmod/issues/list   Wipe cache, dalvik and fix permissions. If your volume doesn't work than how do you use a recovery...?   Even so, that's still digital zoom. OP is talking about having an 8 MP camera, zooming in and having the resulting photo still be at 8 MP (instead of a cropped portion of the original image). I honestly don't see how this could be achieved without moving parts.   Don't most, if not all phones have an "extended battery" available from the manufacturer? I think this is the best of both worlds - the people that want more battery life at the cost of form factor can do so with just a little out of pocket (extended battery + casing for my SGS2 was ~$8).   Same with 10.   Probably not. There's one for unified Google Voice and SMS: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mdrtools.apps.gvintegration   It sorta depends on what device you have.    What's the difference?   Nova has it. Settings  drawer  drawer style   Why is an honest question being down voted? God some of you people in here are so elitist...  No, you don't. But you have to be rooted to take advantage of the widget functionality (drag n drop widgets from the drawer to the home screen). You can still place widgets without root but it just uses a dialogue similar to Gingerbread.    It does. Settings  developer options  kill app with back button (its all the way down the bottom)   Doesn't work for casual subreddits.    That codeworkx fiasco that's been going on, there's about three posts on the front page ATM of it. It only affects the international (exynos) version though.    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias   Easy A. Emma Stone, Good humor, Emma Stone, plenty of memorable one-liners, Emma Stone, and... did I mention Emma Stone?   It does. I just meant it looks/behaves differently than the TW ones that OP would be used to.   Have you tried a data wipe?   Just an fyi: OP has the international SGS2 - not the epic 4g touch. If s/he flashes this rom, it will probably brick their phone.    Isn't that basically what Paranoid Android does? Why are AOKP trying this, their implementation is horrible...   Wow. Is that based on Android?   If you don't already have a reason to root then there really is no need to root. When you want to do something specific that requires rooting, do it then. Don't root and then try to find reasons to justify it afterwards.    CM themes are system wide - they theme the status bar and system assets such as buttons and highlights, a launcher can only theme the home screen. CM brings a bunch of features, custom lock ring targets, customizable notification toggles, weather and your next calendar event on your lock screen, status bar changes such as center clock and battery percentage, and custom hardware button mappings ( http://i.imgur.com/ISI09.png).   The main reason people use CM is because its based on AOSP, which is (arguably) better looking - its what Google intended Android to be. It also allows you to be on the latest version of Android - ie I am currently running Jelly bean thanks to CM10, whereas stock SGS2 is stuck on ICS.  You will lose any touchwiz features. I haven't used Touchwiz in a very long time but things like the stopwatch and alarm clock and the notes app won't be present in CM.   Anyway, the only way you can decide if you like a ROM is to try it yourself. Make a nandroid backup and give it a whirl for a day or so.   A good relationship with an understanding partner can provide this.    This is arguably a feature of a good relationship too...   The past few months have helped me *really* get to know myself, and I've discovered that a huge character flaw of mine is that I just love helping people... almost to the point where I cannot feel happiness on my own, but I have to be making someone else happy to even feel okay.   I've always been the guy that people talk to and I love giving out advice and taking care of my friends. I care way too much about people that don't care about me and its resulted in me getting burned time after time. I try to not let it change me into someone uncaring, because I'm only 17 and I know that I'm the nice guy at heart. I'm a little less trusting now though.   So thanks, your words hit home and mean a lot to me. :)   I know that feel bro. :( The only thing that ever really helped me was medication, and even though I feel I have it under wraps at the moment, it still resurfaces fairly frequently, and it only helps to increase my depressive thinking. I hope you find a solution that works for you.   That's really nice to hear, and is definitely the reason I posted this. Hopefully my story inspires others to seek the help they need. :) Good luck.   Thank you so much. :) I'm sorry for your downvotes, I have no idea why anyone would do that on this subreddit for such an uplifting comment!   No, it wasn't easy. I didn't just wake up one morning and was suddenly ok. This is the result of *three years* of struggling, and I am still in the midst of an ongoing battle. Everyone's experience with depression is different, because its caused and triggered differently and affects everyone in a unique way. The steps that I took to get me back on my feet may not work as well or at all for you. I understand and appreciate that, but there is no need to undermine what I feel is an accomplishment on my part.  I also understand that depression can also incite feelings of anger or hate towards anyone that is remotely happy - I felt this myself and for a long time I hated everyone around me simply because they didn't feel the pain that I did.   For me it increased the severity of my low points (my depression seems to come in waves, and when I started medication these waves were suddenly 100x more intense). But yes I think it also gives you a lot more energy and motivation, unfortunately fueling those suicidal desires.   Thanks, good luck. :)   Thanks, updated!  	110

 ah, another fellow raccoon eyed eighth grader :) i looked like a crossover between someone from My Chemical Romance and someone punched in both eyes. i wish i knew to not put dark purple eyeshadow all over my eyelid and under my waterline, but i thought i was "edgy" hahah   [srs] i mean she spent hundreds on the knockoffs to review them for people who cant afford a $58 UD palette. it was no different  then all the regular hauls and swatches MUA users post with their brand-name items. it was just a silly thing for people to get mad about...    Dang, you were SO close! North Carolina ;)   ARE YOU SAYING IM NOT ALREADY HIGH END???? I AM FLAWLESS, BITCH!   Ur harassing me! Downvote   Oh that makes sense! Thanks for explaining :)   I just ordered Lolita because you rocked it so hard!! Just out of curiosity, why are you holding a blank sheet of paper in one of the last pictures? I've seen it a couple times but I never really understood what it does   My music tempo affects how fast I work! If I'm listening to 2cellos (cello covers of rock songs) I work much slower, but if I listen to metal then I'm lightning quick    Oh my god Bang! Bang! is gorgeous but would not look good with my skin tone. So jealous!   Really? I have only seen spacecake once, but I guess since I'm not always on reddit I may miss the posts      The Borgias! I've never been interested in historical drama but this show takes the cake. Its amazing! Make sure you watch the one with Jeremy Irons (the voice of Scar from the Lion King)   Wow I wish I looked like you when I was 14! I was rocking the raccoon eyeliner and concealer as foundation look... I think a nice bold winged liner could really draw attention to your eyes. Also, if youre a beginner with eye shadow, just find a nice pink shade that looks feminine (not hot pink or anything hahah) and dab that on the lid for a "fresh" look, then apply winged liner. Its good for someone your age and not too over-the-top!   Your brows have a nice shape but they seem really thin... I would recommend looking into filling them in to give you a "fuller", more natural look.   Love the look, but as /u/boppitybeepboop said, just blend a bit more. And I really need to go buy one of those burts bees lip crayons!   Maybe its just me but I rarely ever see anyone do swatches/hauls/FOTD with a Melt Cosmetics product. I have two of their lipsticks in Blow and DGAF and they're gorgeous and perfect for the price! But I have barely seen anyone on MUA review them, which is weird because id expect Melt to be raved over because of the quality and price...   I listen to music and sing my little heart out! Then when I have to do my eyeliner its as quiet as a library for maximum concentration haha   Nah guys. She was 100% serious. Like she posted picture of her and her "besties!!!!!!!!" at school. I would be mortified for LIFE.    Yep! Thats what I have. Its the only Hard Candy product my store carries. There's a WalMart an hour away but I dont think its worth it for some concealer.    I would, but I plan on being a diplomatic translator, so ill have to enjoy the wacky hairstyles while I can~   Wow! Thanks! It actually was very helpful, this was what I was thinking of :)    Judging by the angle their sloping at, I reckon they'll slide off her forehead any minute now...   Well... long story short... her 4,000 instagram followers told her she looked hideous so then she decided to go for an "editorial" look and she grew out her eyebrows and brushed the hairs upwards, which looks even sillier. So the answer is no.   I have medium beige skin with a slight olive undertone, and I'm really lusting over Coven but I'm not sure I could pull it off with my complexion. Could anyone with a similar skin tone comment with some swatches or with you wearing Coven so I can an idea?   	24
 There are thousands of entrepreneurship blogs, forums and websites- general ones, like this, to niche ones that serve specific fields. Why is yours special?  Please realize that your question is the equivalent of asking 'I am thinking of starting a restaurant that is strictly for Greek food, what do you guys think..?!'. That's why you got the responses you did.     Britain's losing ground in recent years is largely a result of its economic structure, the fact it relies heavily on financial services- an area that was obviously shaken hard by the recession. Now that we are exiting the downturn the UK is definitely not losing ground anymore, in fact it is growing faster than any other western economy, has had GDP forecasts increased and will shortly overtake France, perhaps I overestimate the rate of growth but there is little dispute that the UK will be ahead of France in the next few years. (See recent IMF reports, laid out with some quite nice graphics [here](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/economics/10752204/UK-will-be-fastest-growing-economy-in-the-G7-this-year.html)!)  Obviously it is more difficult to forecast economic conditions further ahead but various sources suggest the UK will lead Europe's economies. [The Centre of Economics and Business Research](http://www.cebr.com/reports/cebr-world-economic-league-table/) comes to mind among others. On the assumption that the Euro holds, Germany drops from the 4th largest economy in 2013 to the 6th largest in 2023 and 2028. For France the drop is more precipitous  from 5th in 2013 to 8th in 2018 to 10th in 2023 to 13th in 2028. Similarly Italy drops from 8th in 2013 to 15th in 2028 and Spain from 13th in 2013 to 18th in 2028.   Interestingly, if the euro broke up Germany would fare rather better in the analysis.   Huh? Are you writing this from 2002? I'd never vote for le Front National and I enjoy some of the EU's benefits, but not *even* Greece?  The fact that the euro has one interest rate that's too high for some places and too low for others has hugely prolonged economic decline and mass unemployment at one end of the spectrum and encouraged bubbles in the Spanish and Irish property markets at the other end.   Even putting the economy aside, in the midst of their crisis Brussels made a joke out of democracy in Italy, pressuring the EU commissioner Mario Monti in as Prime Minister and *cheering* as he appointed a new government that contained not a single elected politician.  A Civitas report last week showed that the United Kingdom (I don't personally know what the deal is for other economies) has not seen *any* more trade advantages as an EU member than it would have as a non-member.  The EU has its benefits, but what you say about it being good for every country involved is just not true. Plus, the UK economy will overtake France's this year and is on a trend to be the leader of Europe by 2030, with the pound.  	3

He will play each for 10 minutes, get bored, then never touch them for the rest of his life.   Same with EA and their Dragon Age performance...I got 50FPS in Dragon Age 2 with my 970.............   I played Inquisition for about an hour with only the Keep video to help and I didnt know what was what or why mages were fighting templars, what the chantry was, etc. I then played through DAO and DA2, skipping most pointless side quests and just did the main stories and DLC. Playing Inquisition is drastically more enjoyable as all your actions carry more weight and you can see the cause and effect from past choicss that you made (rather than some website flash game).   Granted it wouldnt have the same impact. I did the Keep before DAO and DA2 and had no idea what was happening. There id no explanation about the mages plight in Thedas, who the Templars are, what Ferelden is, etc   I spent last night in a ditch   I think it's better than Origins. I just finished playing DAO and DA2 for the first time ever this past month to prepare myself for DAI which I started on Saturday.   Absolutely. Incredible game - make sure you play Dragon Age Origins and 2, or else the story and lore won't make much sense.   Why make a big post on Reddit? Why wouldn't one's immediate reaction to call EA Origin customer service?   I wouldn't call an unfinished alpha an "incredible game." Let's wait for release.   What drama happened exactly?

While I don't like the environments as much, the combat is way better (especially since I played mage in both).  Can't wait for Inquisition !!   Considering the state of modern AAA gaming - unoptimized ports that do not take advantage of all 4 cores, let alone 8 - I doubt the 8 cores will be of any advantage for quite some time unless you're doing video editing or something CPU-intensive.   Your CPU will rarely get to anywhere near 100% load on most games. If you want to burn your CPU, use Prime95.  As for games, it's the usual; check drivers first, uninstall old drivers, play around in-game settings and try other higher-end games (as CSGO and Smite look like last-gen games).   Just saying with his budget...if I were him I'd save up and get a 970 next year when the new 1080 or whatever the heck comes out.   Operating system?    When my 970 FTW really works hard I do get a bit of coil whine but its unnoticeable when game audio gets loud (or wearing headphones).  Performance wise, I get 50-60FPS maxed at 1440p in the most demanding games. Crysis 3 at max, MSAAx2, gives me about 45FPS and that is easily the most demanding game on market. The only game that is killing me is Dragon Age Inquisition @ 35-50FPS on *high* (not max). Can you say *unoptimized console port?*  If I knew about the coil whine before, I would have bought another card and down the "FTW" overclock myself.   You know you need to rebuy Windows for a new PC, right?   Get a GTX 660 - they're slightly better than a 750ti and will cost about $190 + tax.   I have changed it manually in-game. When I overclock to 120 or even 96, the frame skipping tests showed positive. I think my monitor just can't overclock.

Only if you plan on overclocking your CPU (which the 4690 can do in spades). I have the same cooler as you - let's me get up to 4.5GHz on my i5.  Do i need thermal paste?  Yes.

If you have a friend with a nice toolbox, ask to borrow it (or get your friend to help build!).   Others reported getting their QNIX to 120Hz just fine. I tried OCing to 144Hz for fun and got crazy graphical glitches so clearly Nvidia is doing it's job. Maybe I just cannot see the difference.   Various benchmarks (heaven, valley), this website: http://www.testufo.com/#test=framerates  Far cry 4, dragon age 1/2/3, etc. All look the same 60 or 120 (I lower settings as I see fit to get them to run up to 120).  Strange thing is the testing website gives me 120Hz and games say the same thing. Windows says 120Hz. Nvidia says 120Hz. Even FRAPS and Shadowplay say 61+ FPS yet I cannot see a visual difference for the life of me.   I overclocked my QNIX to 120Hz and don't notice any difference from 60FPS :(   I thought you can buy any EA game and play it for 24 hours then return it? Or is that only for PC?   You get the same kind of goodies with other pre-orders; how is this any different?    Even if there's problems at release, they will be promptly fixed and all new content for the game will be free.  But how do you *know* this? Every developer has claimed the same, yet time and time again this is not always the case.   Watch this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mf5Uj4XIT1Y  What is with this attachment people having to developers? You don't know them. You don't work with them or for them. You pay them money for a product when it *releases.* Pre-ordering is so incredibly fucking pointless for digital products, it boggles the mind why someone except the most rabid of fanboy would go through with it.  I don't fucking care if Witcher 1 and 2 were great (they were). You don't work for CDProjekt Red. They could have entirely new management for all we know and completely fuck up Witcher 3. You don't know. All you have is this blind, unfounded faith in a group of Polish game developers. It makes no fucking sense.   I tried overclocking mine and Nvidia and Windows BOTH said it was at 120Hz at some point...yet I saw no difference with mouse, window and in-game movement. Maybe my eyes "can't see past 60fps?"  The online monitor test said it was at 120hz too, yet the 120 and 60fps UFOs didn't show any difference.  http://www.testufo.com/#test=framerates   Why are you pre-ordering? What fucking purpose does that serve? Have you learned nothing from other games?  I don't care if GabeN himself came into your room with Half-Life 3 and offered it as a pre-order - don't fucking pre-order games. There's no point anymore.   Get a 1440p monitor for now - you will notice a substantial difference from 1080p, a single high-end GPU can run the vast majority of games at 60FPS on max settings and they're fairly inexpensive (I got my QNIX 1440p monitor within 2 days from Korea for $300).   750ti is shit for the price they're probably offering.   I am running a GTX 970 @ 1440p, with an i5-3570k @ 4.5GHz. I should not be getting FPS stutters in a game like Dragon Age 2.  What gives? This game is optimized horribly. It goes anywhere from 45 to a constant 60 (which is where it should be all the time).   Staples employee here. Same deal - diagnostic for $50, then whatever we need to do is extra. Usually around $150 for a whole setup dealy   For the 200 price range, 660 is good, 760 is best. I do have an old GTX 670 since I upgraded recently, but I can't explicitly sell things on this subreddit (that's what /r/hardwareswap is for).  http://www.videocardbenchmark.net/high_end_gpus.html   $160 if you're Canadian, more cause international shipping (gimme your postal code and i can do the calculation).   Don't need the watch - I like my traditional analog watches ;)  But I got a Gigabyte GTX 670 that's only 2 years old, still runs great. I upgraded to a GTX 970 last week, so looking to sell it. This is the model: http://www.newegg.ca/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814125423  It will work SLI with your Zotac, as they're both 2GB version.   Well it will be cheaper at least later if you want another card for Crossfire   Wow that CPU is way overpowered for your GPU.   Get this one: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16819116942nm_mc=AFC-C8Junctioncm_mmc=AFC-C8Junction-_-na-_-na-_-nacm_sp=AID=10446076PID=3938566SID=  With the $50 you save, upgrade your GPU to a 760 instead. http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814127744cm_re=gtx_760-_-14-127-744-_-Product  Otherwise it is a fine build. Sexy case   Dang they price corrected :(   Get this instead - substantial upgrade for $30 more: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814202080cm_re=290-_-14-202-080-_-Product  And 500W is fine if you're not using 2 cards.   See for yourself: http://ssds.findthebest.com/compare/574-632/Crucial-MX100-512GB-CT512MX100SSD1-vs-Samsung-850-Pro-1000GB-MZ-7KE1T0BW  TLDR: not really. 1TB one has better warranty, longer life span, and better random speeds (but that is very minor at this stage).   I am a game dev too, so I have 16GB in my desktop. I started with 8, and like I said, waited for RAM go on sale - which it often does. I'd suggest using the extra money to get the 290X now if you find a good price, then wait for RAM to get marked down in a few weeks for Boxing Day.  For Maya, Adobe CS, etc. 8GB is enough unless you're doing super heavy-duty stuff (like an extremely hi-res model of a Star Citizen-esque spaceship).  Unless if you need the RAM now, the 290 is still a great card.  Do you have peripherals already?   1TB is 62cents a GB. 512 is 40c a GB. The 512 is more economical - also if one drive fails you're not completely screwed.   Hard drive? SSD? Will need somewhere to store Windows + games.  And unless you really need 16GB ram (which is usually overkill), get 8GB for $50 less and use that money towards and 290X instead.  If you need 16GB, wait for Boxing Day when that kind of stuff (RAM, hard drives, small stuff) goes down 50% off.   FYI for those getting a 970, the FTW is only another $20-30 and has a significant overclock   980 if you have the money. Or 970 now and SLI later. Don't need a steam box; just get HDMI cable to tv, run Steam Big Pictute with controller.   Get a 1440p monitor and we got the same PC (minus the 2 SSDs)   Probably next summerish, I'd say a year's anniversary and we'll start seeing announcements about a transition   Hey Bart want to go play with the x-ray machine in that abandoned hospital?   At least Molyneux makes decently fun, albeit shallow games. Dean just made a shitty mod for a shitty engine then charged suckers like myself $30 to play.   Thats bullshit. Ive worked with NZ, AU and Canadian expats in the telecomm field and all he needs is a work visa.   He's an ideas man who abandons projects before completion  If he can show me a finished game I'll regain consumer confidence in him, otherwise he can fuck off with his new studio.   Well I'll just keep these then   Did you overclock anything? What drivers? Can you take a screenshot of your settings and/or in-game FPS? I'm dying to get above 40FPS at 1440p   Far Cry 4 runs at 45-50FPS on ultra for me at that resolution and GPU  Dragon Age Inquisition even worse at 35-40FPS. How does Crysis 3 run better than DAI on my 970?   The new Runescape has a scary resemblance to Albion.   eve? darkfall? tibia? and you say AA is not close? dafuq? How has no one mentioned Runescape, the almost direct predecessor to Albion Online? Fuck, they're even similar in art and interface style.   https://marvelheroes.com/registration   Awesome OP. I have, unfortunately, had the opposite experience on Balmung. Cliquey roleplayers, elitists and other snobs who completely ignore me if I try to roleplay or ask a simple question.   I did the tapestry thing on EA's website and had no idea what was going on LOL, so it may be a good idea   I own all three Dragon Ages, but never played 2 nor progressed far in Origins. Should I play them before Inquisition, or is the story not really related?  I loved how Mass Effect kept the same character through all three; does Inquisition do the same?   Aftermarket coolers can extend the life span of your CPU, overclocked or base clock.   Sold my account back in June when I saw them first changing labour points.

I got one last week and it's awesome. Overclocked to 120Hz easily. Korean all the way from now on; so cheap and just as good.   Would an 8800 Ultra work? I got one of those too lying around.

 I'm kind of the same as well. I don't really stress out over things. As a kid the plans my parents would make was always a 50/50 of whether or not they followed through so I've learned to just roll with things. I don't make plans. If something happens, then I just go with it. I'm always surprised at how emotional people can get and how stressed out they can be. I started thinking people would find my calmness very odd so now I try to "show" more of a emotional reaction when really I'm pretty calm.   Is it not common practice to clean your place before going on vacation? When I started living on my own I made it a habit of cleaning my entire place whenever I would be out of town. I really don't like the idea of coming home to dirty sheets, dishes in the sink, and garage in the garbage bin that's been sitting there for awhile. Even now that I have a roommate who will be home I always make sure to clean the entire place before I leave.   Frak. I wish I knew this yesterday when I got a spam text for some FIFA prize thingy and a link. I deleted the damn text but wish I could report it now.   One christmas my aunt gave my siblings and me a camera that printed small stickers. It was an awesome gift but then she told us she had given it to us by accident and it wasn't meant for us but we could have it. She intended to give us this crap gift.   I never completed Star Wars Episode 1 Racer. There is one track I couldn't get past.   A family friend told me that he went to a private party where the Dixie Chicks played for 1 million. I'm pretty sure I'm gonna save up now!   The Power of Myth by Joseph Campbell.   I love this show. Glad to hear there's a movie coming.   I couldn't snap either so I decided to learn. I just practiced for a few days. Hurt because my fingers weren't used to doing it but now I can snap with my right fingers, left not so much.   I never understood the alligator thing so I just think that it points to the smaller number. If it starts small, it's less than.   Last year I took a year off of school and stayed with my parents. I was probably unemployed for like six months while I was there before I got a job. My parents travelled a lot so I took care of their two dogs, the house, and helped with both of brother's kids whenever they needed a babysitter or needed someone to drop off/pick up the kids from school. It sucked. I was bored out of my mind. I spent my days taking the dogs for walks, visiting my grandma who lived down the street, and cleaning the house. A lot of internet surfing and watching movies.   This works for me. I'm near sighted in my right eye but my vision isn't too blurry in that eye. It just makes things a little sharper.   My 6 year old nephew probably would.   My gamer friend introduced me to minecraft when it was in its early days. Now my 6 year old nephew plays it on his xbox and my 5 year old niece plays it on her ipad.    As someone from a small town who loves country music, the whole "I'm so country" is wearing thin. My hometown is traditionally hunter-gatherer so no farms, ranches or horses. It's just hunting and harvesting. The people who live that life don't talk about it and post it on facebook because it's just life to them. It's no big deal that they split logs, put down fish nets, and set up traps and travel hundreds of kilometers to catch bigger game while holding down jobs to take care of their family. They're not tailgating, having bonfires, drinking beer from a dixie cup, or posing with their guns for facebook. That boat they own has a purpose and so does that snowmobile, it's to get them to their nets or traps and to travel long distances over water or land for bigger game. And that truck they have is to transport the cords of wood they cut to either heat their homes or in the summer cook their food over a firepit.   Guitar stand. My brother and me would prop them against our stomachs and pretend to be x wing fighter pilots or something. Pew pew pew. Flying around the house until our dad demanded we put them back.   I'd be a slacker or a moocher because I wasn't thinking about what I wanted to be at 5. I was too busy being a dusty kid with scraped knees in a small town.   I haven't had cable tv in two years. I do have netflix and if I want to watch a new episode of a show I'll go to the networks website the day after it airs and watch it there. My roommate doesn't watch TV, just youtube vloggers. So no cable tv missed.   Emma Watson, Jennifer Lawrence, Rachel Weisz, Kristen Stewart, Kate Winslet.   ""RON - WEASLEY!"

 test_subject5099    It is the correct format, probably can't be parsed because it goes into next year.   The plugin, being from /r/ultrahardcore, I feel that the plugin is 100x better, for no ghast tears, enderpearl damage can be toggled, player heads, golden heads; with all of this, I feel makes the game a lot better and more strategic.   The overall format is Mmm DD HH:MM UTC - (Title)   The correct format for this match is Oct 06 01:30 UTC - Cheesy's #3 To3   Sep removes them from extreme hills and chests.   Match posts must be made at least an hour in advance.   Thanks Obama   I wish more kills to you, and death upon you at the same time :D   Next time, your post must be at least an hour in advance.   Whitelist isn't off.    probably    The correct format for this particular match is "Sep 30 18:00 UTC - dannyminez's #3 To3 Endurance (Sign Up)"    test_subject5099   I did then lol   Walden, matches cannot be posted less than an hour in advance. Do not be surprised if this is taken down.    I was in the game :L   Then don't, but we really don't either.   He made the best out of a bad situation :D   Listen D4, your post is going to be removed because only mods can post goodbyes. Sorry to see you go, but rules are rules.   To add to this, this was 2 hours ago. However, being that it doesn't say impromptu, as much as I want it to be today, is probably tomorrow.   The civilization crumbles, and you walk quietly back in, and we all listen, all of us, in spirit.    Maybe the one that isn't an asshole.    "isn't"   Then that is not an allies game, thats a long distance to2 with solos.   You can always backstab in an allies game.   I can't get the ip to work, can you supply the number ip?   Incorrect formatting, the correct format for this match is Sep 24 00:45 UTC - Awalk's To2 w/solos   and maybe test_subject5099?   test_subject5099   Sep 22 16:00 UTC - MCRuler10 #1, FFA (Return of Funk)*** I only assume its today.   Sep 22 07:00 UTC - FFA - Big Toe's Impromptu #12* :P   RTo5 means random teams of five, so there is no guarantee you can play with your friend.   Sep 22 09:00 UTC - *   When sessions go up everyone jumps like this and it DDOSes the servers so they time out again.   No golden apples or heads?   Sup   Yes, but on an even higher level, where one enters the nether or things of that nature, especially with things like enderrush. I played a few of those games though, and sometimes it helped me get gold or diamonds I wouldn't normally see right away.   You are able to toggle it in default minecraft I believe, but I would like to see scenarios using this functionality.    and a hyphen :P   "Date and Time: Sunday, September 16 02:00 UTC (09:00 PM EST)" 02:00 UTC is 10 EDT :P    Also, how many allies?   Guy, the format you want to use for this particular match would be: Sep 16 20:00 UTC - DIg224#1 Vanilla FFA with Allies   The correct format is Mmm DD HH:MM UTC - (Title)   Is it FFA or To3?, it says To3 in the post.   I got pots (which yes, can make this completely invalid, but it was still pretty cool) and I went to 0,0 with 30 minutes left in the game, then, I see a guy, do a typical st2 2 shot, then it gets interesting. I see another guy in the desert, 2 shot him, see 2 more in the distance, run up and kill them both, turn around and kill another, and then go down into a temple to re-brew and heal. All this took less than a minute. As it turned out, there was enough diamonds left on the ground for full diamond, but I couldn't pick them up. :D (I won after 2 more kills if you didnt guess)   Once again, please use the correct format: Mmm DD HH:MM UTC(space)-(space)(title)   Announcement flair is for moderators only.   The format is UTC(SPACE)-(SPACE)(Title) :P xD, definitely don't delete and repost, just remember for next time.   As long as you know the rules, its not a problem.   I mean, at least the impromptus would follow the rules, they werent even posted an hour in advance.   See here - http://www.reddit.com/r/ultrahardcore/comments/1k53na/regarding_impromptu_and_official_matches/    http://www.reddit.com/r/ultrahardcore/comments/1k53na/regarding_impromptu_and_official_matches/ No need for a mod to message you, it is against the rules, pushing your game back 15 minutes would suffice, but rules are rules, and while there may be enough players for all three, many time there are not, so please follow the rules.   While it is true that he does host everyday, and hosting an FFA at the same time, there should still be players, then there is no problem with holding the FFA back 15 minutes for people that want to play that, correct? Rules are Rules, even if they dont matter at one point, they do at another.   Games must be posted at least an hour in advance, no earlier.   Games must be posted at least an hour in advance, no earlier, and the correct format is MMM DD HH:MM UTC - (title)   Please use the correct format, the format is MMM DD HH:MM UTC - (title), and you may want to add some additional information, such as the nether, length of the game, and number of people.    The game that prompted crimson to write this was an ffa with one ally, and no backstabbing, to give some context, long distance to2 is basically that, in its entirety, for one change and one only, no teleport.   "Long Distance" To2 with solos and FFA with allies of 1 and no backstabbing are the exact same thing, infact, I've seen some hosts tp allies together before, there has to be a set description for these scenarios, it seems just too common that the two blend together.   1: No, I cannot record. 2. Anytime on the weekends or anything from 18:30 - 02:30 UTC 3. Teams, but only due to my inability to record, teaming with players who can would be beneficial.   Do you have an alternate ip? I cannot resolve the hostname due to the type of ip this is.  	61

I told her that we can give him some magazines to read until his thin client is set up, which normally doesn't take too long since we happen to have some in stock. Unfortunately, since she waited to tell us about the new guy...the new guy is going to wait until  *we*  get ready for him to work.

 Sorry, friend. Best of luck.   Edit:Just to double check and make things clear, I was replying to the user above you. I have no problem with your thread.    Fuck yeah, man. Thank you.

Test was performed by Lorillard, the tobacco company (owned by Reynolds American, who are against anything that isn't a cartomizer), who manufactures Blu.  The experiment uses:  Three blu eCigs products (approximately 50% of the US market) and two SKYCIG products (approximately 30% of the UK market) were chosen for evaluation. Marlboro Gold Box (US), and Lambert   Butler Original and Menthol products (UK),  Not really relevant to our products, but good for their marketing and FDA approval.    Understood. Thank you much, Smog, for the quick reply. I'll stick around and wait for an update on shipping from you.    From VapeNW also?   I paid for mine on 1/19 :\\. I hope they weren't late for making the order, because that's pretty early.   So we've seen that the iStick 50w has seen some massive delays, from Jan 26th to possibly early March.   However, on /r/electronic_cigarette, I've discovered that a [few people](http://www.reddit.com/r/electronic_cigarette/comments/2vnplb/my_mvp_20_died_after_one_year_of_solid_vaping_i/cojjuk6), one who even ordered just 2 days ago, already have the iStick 50w in hand, from [vapeNW](http://vapenw.com/istick-50w-by-eleaf). [Eciggity](http://www.eciggity.com/eleaf-istick-50w-battery/) also has them in stock, as does [OriginVape](https://originvape.com/product/eleaf-istick-50w/).   Is there any update to the date that we should expect our iStick 50w's? I was sort of expecting that through this group-buy we'd be some of the first to get the product - but it's already on shelves elsewhere.   Thank you, much. I'll have to ask my distributor about this. I was able to preorder mine for only $39 including shipping, but he said that no products would be send out until way after Chinese New Year.   Dammit. I must've pre-ordered in the wrong place. That's frustrating. Where did you pre-order yours?    No way. Where did you buy it from?    Istick 50w is supposed to reach the states by ~~March 5th~~ **now I guess**. It's original release date was January 26th,and it's been pushed back 3-4 times.    I enjoy Big Bang Theory.

Cringefest.    Hey OP. If you have the time for a good read, please take a look at my latest college paper. My college research topic was electronic cigarettes, and I spent a huge deal of time looking through information, scientific experiments, and professional opinions on this topic. [Here is the link to my final course paper,](https://www.mediafire.com/?5ev46znw9etboyk) it's in Microsoft Word compatibility format. I think it will answer a lot of your questions, and the work's cited page will include sources for all of the data I am representing.   The film on my car is so bad that at night, all of my windows and the windshield freeze on the inside. Even driving for 40 minutes with the defroster on full blast will not remove the frozen film. When it's not that cold out, my windows are constantly fogged up - even in the rear. I never vape with closed windows - the drivers side window is always open no matter how cold, and the defroster is permanently on in my car while driving. I took rags with rubbing alcohol and windex out to rub all my glass down, but no success.    Thank you very much!    Hey, this is nsfw   How can I downgrade to a previous version? Is there a site where I can find a previous version of the apk to push to my phone?   A few of my guesses were within 2 miles, but then the site crashed on round 5/5 :((((((   terrorism   The way I see it, 263,000 kids who would have smoked picked up a vape instead and are still nonsmokers.    Agreed. And old band of mine used to cover the song and it's very fun to play.    [Conor hates his own voice, too.](http://youtu.be/37r9aqTxhBQ?t=2m49s)   Ouch, man! Dave Grohl is god :\\.

It wouldn't ruin smogs reputation, my friend. They delayed from Jan 25th to March 6th   How did you choose vaping? It seems like you still took her to dinner and then home without breaking things off with her. Outside of my love for vaping, she sounds like someone I would've gotten rid of, or at least turned around the car and dropped her back off at home. Sucks, man - you never win with a woman.

I think you're done with real reddit for today. Head over to /r/circlejerk or /r/montageparodies.   You have nothing to be sorry about! I understand the question and it's thought provoking. Just clearing it up for a fellow redditor out of the loop   Not weird at all, my friend. That's why it's growing exponentially in popularity. If you feel interested in looking for a setup, you can let me know, or check out /r/electronic_cigarette (hit or miss nowadays). I've done quite a bit of research on electronic cigarettes, and from what I've seen from the data, its a much healthier alternative. My bronchi tells me otherwise after about a year and a half, but I have yet to prove that it's due to vaping, and it seems to be a very isolated experience that I'm having.   It IS, however, trading an addiction for another if you choose to use nicotine(all Eliquids also come in nicotine free versions!) - but I truly enjoy it and it's a much more manageable addiction due to the ability to fully customize your nicotine intake.    if you have too much, you'll just feel uncomfortable for a couple hours.   Depends on the person. As someone who used to struggle with an anxiety disorder, I actually managed to have a really bad trip that screwed me up for quite some time.   About 50% of my trips would be bad, the longest being 3.5 hours. Actually tried ending my life the next day.   Now I'm all good though. Blaze on.     Love the taste, actually.    Vapes, for sure. It seems every time I get stoned or drunk it's all people want to talk to me about.    No. You have to tell everyone on reddit to not give you gold.   Edit: thanks for the gold   Check out the top posts on /r/wheredidthesodago   Torrent books  Don't allow yourself to leave campus until your homework is finished. You become much more motivated to complete it entirely.    Great question. I was thinking about asking the same one. It's always funny hearing a commercial start off, "I'm raising money" and then immediately go to the next commercial. Kinda just like, oh, that's nice.   Hope this gets answered. My only idea is that the company stopped paying the channel and this is a legal way for the channel or TV provider to require the company to keep paying without actually/fully advertising for them. Just a guess.    It helps to just ignore it. A fraction of people in every community everywhere just suck.   White Knight    Does it still say that somewhere? I can't find it. Last I heard from Smog it was late Feb/early March. If it got finalized to 3/5 that's kinda a super bummer.

The problem with the original istick 20w is that it will only fire coils whose resistance measures out to equal to or greater than 1 ohm. If it's anything like my 12w MVP v2.0, it isn't powerful enough to fire dual coils, either. Another person recommended the istick 50w. They are expected to be released in late February or early March, but their release has already been delayed twice. I'm still getting one, but just be ready for a wait. I would not recommend a aspire Cf subohm battery to replace the istick, as they are not similar in any way. The aspire battery has one button to push to fire, no variable voltage. It's like a beginners mechanical mod, essentially.   I think the istick 50w IS going to be great, and I recommend waiting for it if you have the patience, unless you can trade in your 20w istick for the newer 30w which fires sub ohm coils.   If you like the idea of a Lemo drop on a 30w istick, my friend just purchased this setup and I can send you pictures of how the tank fits on the istick. They are made by the same company, designed for the istick, so it should look good.    Sure thing!    Hang in there, friend. It's one of the roughest things to deal with, but it gets better in time.   Yes....  I'm suggesting a plot twist  The Vinegar was LSD   Super Douche? Nice.

 Oh my goodness, thank you for clearing that up!!! That actually makes me feel a lot better about looking for a place.     Also, is that area LGBT friendly?    I'm gonna be moving to Salt Lake City late May/early June and I'm currently looking for an apartment. There are a few places that I would like to live because they are near stores and the rent is fairly cheap. I don't have a car or license, so it's crucial that I find a place with lots of public transportation. I found a place with really cheap rent in South Salt Lake. The apartment complex is called "La Porte Properties Apartments, this is the address:2505 South State, Salt Lake City, UT 84115. I looked at the place on google maps, street view, but from what I saw, it really doesn't seem like a nice place. Not bad, but not nice. I couldn't really find if there was a trax line(I believe that's what it's called) anywhere. I couldn't find any shopping centers anywhere near the place, either. For someone who doesn't have a car, is this not a good place to live?    Thank you, very much!       Oh my goodness, thank you so much!   	6
 [Well here you go] (http://myanimelist.net/animelist/nexxy)   Unfortunately didnt help.   Hello everyone, sooo I have this problem with pop-out windows all of them have [THIS] (http://imgur.com/D13f8Zb) weird kind of visual bug.   I tried to disable all addons (also deleted and redownloaded them again) and I ran the scan and repair in launcher. I would rather not reinstall the whole game, so Im asking if anyone has some experience.   Sorry if this doesnt belong here and also thanks for all the responses.   you get it if you level up your compendium to lvl 150   Im gonna go with TTGL, maybe its beacuse of the situation I was in when i started watching but it helped me to feel so much better and every time i hear [this] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VT6LFOIofRE) i gotta start singing too.

 I love tea. The problem is that I eat some cake, maybe some cookies or a sandwich (or four) with it. Great tip. Small steps, focus on today, always get back up. Good luck to you too!    This is exactly what happened to me. Last year I was home on sick leave because of my depression. I was so tired of always dieting and I felt like I needed to just let go and focus on my mental health. All I did was lay on my couch eating. In some way it felt necessary given the situation I was in but now I'm in a much better place mentally and it is time to focus on my physical health.   Maybe I shouldn't be afraid to take my time. Those six months will go by either way. I can be the same weight as now or I can take it slow and maybe be 10-20 lbs lighter.   I love cheese and it actually helps me losing weight. Some parmesan or feta is great in a sallad and doesn't add to much calories. That I can handle. Brie and some crackers is a whole other story... ;)   Thank you. You have no idea how much this helps. Focus on today will be my new mantra.    That is exactly how I felt when I got pregnant with our oldest five years ago and here I am, still overweight and unhappy. Don't let the years slip away as I did. We can do this!    You really hit the nail with this post. I will never change if I keep cheating myself. It will be hard but from now on I'm going to log everything.   	5
 Haha Well, yes and no. I've had some fun but I feel like this trip has been devoted to a lot of problem solving in my life. Internally and externally. Dealing with work, goals, relationships (non-romantic), etc. Lots of progress I think (:   I'm more of a night person, myself. Plus watching the sunrise is just something I'm accustomed to while tripping now. It's like, The perfect ending.   Bloody chapped legs??? Oh man that sounds excruciating! I'd like to hear that story aha Right now I'm chilling, self evaluating. Listening to the new Kendrick Lamar album through. Great album, I appreciate his background and the messages he's trying to convey and the stories and ideas. Maybe that's a bit of a thought loop though, sorry aha    Received, friend. Finally relaxing. Coming off a peak. My hands are still jittery so typing is still hard but I'll come back to this post. Thanks guys, this subreddit is like a safe haven for my wandering mind.   Ughh, well it was an adventure for sure. First I got in the car and I just thought "Wow, I can be free now. No longer have to keep my cool." Then I realized I'm trapped in a car with two of my closest friends, but also two other people (in the backseat of a 1-door car of course) who I don't know very well. We drive around, oddly enough run into some other mutual friends and then we stopped at 7/11. I asked them to go in for me, gave them the cash and told them what I wanted. Water, cashews, swedish fish. They come back with a fucking gallon of water and the swedish fish. I told them "No! I know there's cashews in there and I have the money!" So I ran in and got the cashews and came back to the car. Then I realized "I'm not getting what I want, I'm getting what I would've got if I was sober". So I was annoyed but it was all fun. Until I discovered we were just going to a place so they could drink. I was less than compliant and I eventually got my friend to take me home. So it was interesting so far, good and bad. Interesting. Sorry, it's so difficult to type but I'll come back to this post in reality.   My good friend said he'd call me at 10pm to see if I wanted to get picked up. I still have so much planned for my trip at home though. What should I do? Uncertainty is always exciting, and I think we might going to his really trippy room buuuuuut I did wanna experience a few things first. Like, things I've been saving in my journal for next time I trip. I'm peaking now, so that's the thing. Do I spend my peak with them or with me? Why am I asking reddit this? You guys can't make decisions for me Ahahah But it'd be cool if you could. I'm sorry for the typing too, I feel like it's getting sloppy. It's gross, I hate it man. But whao didn't mean to get negative. 3 3 But yeah, this was an unnecessarily long reply to your comment haha   Yeah man, my cat's been giving me funny looks aha And I really thought I almost broke my glasses.. They're fine though haha   Wow, I forgot how much of a burden typing is while tripping..      I really love your story, I related to some parts of it and I appreciate you sharing it with us. Especially the personal details and self evaluation. I'm definitely saving this and showing it to some friends.      Definitely! Spread the word, too. The developers are completely behind it. I think it'll be pretty nice to have a physical copy of both games, plus the comic. And that mixtape will be schweet. Definitely get it, man.   Hahahha Dude, I stare in awe when I'm sober so I can only imagine aha   Three hits of LSD, I'm not sure the exact dosage.   Yeah, I imagine it'll be hard with 2-3 tabs. But I also love puzzles and when I trip I can just figure them out a lot easier. Hotline Miami is really like a puzzle game, in a sense, so that would be cool. The fast paced aspect could go either way, sometimes I can focus really well but if I'm tripping hard it'll all be really blurry. I'd still like to try just for the story aspect alone.   I have been waiting a very long time to do this. Can't wait.   Finally have a chance to play these games while tripping. Can't fuckin' wait! Could be incredible and terrifying at the same time. Especially when the "Richard" music plays aha I will report back with my experience!   That's interesting, actually. I might enjoy this myself if I knew where to go haha   I'm also an audiophile myself, so that's all under control haha I might actually look at some books in the library. I always loved flipping through encyclopedia's when I was a kid.  	18
 If over time waves lose energy and speed, does that mean that there are separate sections for waves of separate wavelengths? I'm thinking this because if if an X-ray were to lose energy over time and become a radio wave,  wouldn't it be moving at the same rate as all other radio waves created near the same time? Then over time, wouldn't there be a huge difference in the number of radio waves and all other wavelengths?   I don't mean to be mean  but I'll make you my queen  if you suck on my peen  I keep it very clean  and it's really quite lean  I'm sorry it's green  I got a bad gene  but to counter the green, it has a nice sheen  I'll be honest, I'll become quite keen  if only you only  just suck on my peen      	3
 My favorite rpg is Nobilis would this be expected to be to my liking?   I know that combat is not the focus and that spells aren't worth it but i'd still like to be able to create my own (with rulesystem) even if that means my character won't use them mostly.   I know magic is hard and has repercussion but i still want to play a sorceror type of character and would the system be apopriate for something based of SCP?  freeform system would be best if there is such a thing as in M:taw or rules for spell creation.   Would i be able to play as a character made for Nobilis (As in the players are incarnations of an aspect of reality ie: fire, swords,cats-with-blue-eyes,etc?) the characters are IMMENSlY powerful beings limited to their resources (miracle points) that can only be recharged when they role-play well(It' kinda tricky to get them back so most just hoard them for a long long time).   some of them are immortal tough as in immortal cannot die kind of way.  they have complete control over their aspect (if they can spend the MP for it) BUT they also must protect it otherwise he will get weaker and weaker until that aspect is completly removed from existence.  and some have items or abilities that are very powerful but also cost MP to use.  i think it'd be fun mortal characters interacting with characters like that striking deals with "Gods" and such.  Could this be the dat where i find a Sandbox game that allows me to play with my characters from Nobilis?  If you'd like more details or wanna discuss things feel free to do ask.   FU?   looks cool enough  My favorite rpg is Nobilis would this be a good alternative?   Nobilis could probably fit.   Is creating characters on the fly easy?   Are there setting less superhero-ish? without all the spandex and stuff more in the line of infamous?  how does combat drag out?     	10
 I had sociology last semester and there is a word for this. If I remember correctly it's called the second shift. Women who work are still expected to do the cooking and cleaning and laundry and child rearing. Men often cook maybe once a week on a grill and have a Saturday chore of mowing the lawn and washing the car.    Can we say butch lesbian instead? That's rather offensive with that phrasing.   Did you survive the seizure?   There are intersex people and people whose bodies don't quite line up with male and female because they are transitioning.    "Doodle Dog is beat and so am I."   "Hey baby, did you know that the uh mitochondria is the powerhouse of the cell? It's kinda like how these guns are the powerhouse of this."   Did you sing the one about the fish with the pig like nose? That's the one I remember, not the song from hsm2    I'm also in PA. Going down the shore is a pretty regular thing.   I think he should suck it up and just do it. It's just hair.   She is over the age of consent and can therefore make a decision on what to do with her body and her baby. She isn't 10. She can legally work and provide for a child. Birth control failure happens. It doesn't make her irresponsible.    You know nothing about me or my wife or our relationship other than what is here, which is a poor decision and a shitty family member. You have nothing to draw that conclusion from. Also, you need to learn to spell and figure out what homophones are.   I'm sorry that was confusing. She remains cordial so that he will pay for her phone. He pays for her phone because he knows he otherwise won't have her number. I don't communicate with him at all and only see him when needed. I haven't spoken to him since the week after Christmas when he gave my wife her gift. She hasn't spoken to him since except on her birthday two weeks ago.   Her father outright states that he despises me. My wife does not want him involved in our lives at all. He abused both of us in the past. I tried to push her to invite him since he is her dad but she didn't want him to know. My family and hers have nothing to do with one another. It was really just having her mom and four sisters not spill the beans. Her three youngest sister didn't say a word, nor did her mother. Her other sister did it intentionally to cause problems.   Luckily, I'm not in a sitcom. We needed 5 people not to share and four did it with no problem. Her sister, on the other hand, was purely malicious.   Her family acts that way, not my wife. She is just nonconfrontational and doesn't know how to deal with it. Also I'm a woman as well so it has nothing to do with sexism.   Go to your county assistance office. Often you can get temporary help for situations like this one.   When I was a kid I liked to scratch my head on my dad's beard like this.   I probably should but I think I'll be busy deleting Facebook and finding a lawyer.   My wife is aware but her family is kind of like, "well that's just (name)." She tried to shove me down some stairs at a Christmas party in front of everyone but then I caught the wall and she ran to the bathroom. I let it go because I wasn't about to be the one in the wrong when parts of her family are just starting to come around after her years of lies.   I already didn't want to go. I see it as a waste of money and time. I have never liked these people and since I would otherwise have to stay with my former abuser, I will either have to drive back down or get a hotel. My wife agrees with me about this.   I think you give really good advice. Even though they are connected, the three are separate issues. Damage control seems to only be possible if we are honest and explain all of it to the family members. My wife plans to deal with her sister after she gives birth. This isn't the first time her sister has done things like this but for us it will be the last. My wife intends to pretty much go no contact with her sister except in regards to her nephew. It is for the best if I don't talk to the sister in law because my anger and hatred will explode and then her father will get involved and it will be ugly as ever.    I am a woman, since clearly you can't read.  My wife and I made the decision together to not tell her family, and her sister knew and defied it. I don't need anything else to hate her. She physically attacked me. That's reason enough.   The baby is the first of his generation and my wife is expected to be there. This sister is also her only whole sibling; the other three are from her mom's second marriage, so her father has a weird hang up about it. She doesn't have her licence yet and we both have agreed that she is not to be around her father without me. She doesn't want to be around her father at all so she doesn't want to go, but she is a people pleaser and doesn't want to disrupt the family.   Yes, yes it does.   Her sister was told directly not to tell people and intentionally defied it.   Her family is kind of crazy. She has a 37 year old uncle who walks past me and ignores me at family functions. His wife also will only give me dirty looks or talk about her dog. This stupid, immature behavior is the kind of thing I experience every time I'm around them.   The wedding happened so fast. We went from being in a long term committed relationship to being married in 6 weeks, not even really having an engagement. Since it happened so fast, we didn't get much time to think about who to invite and we decided that no one in my wife's family needed to know besides her mother and four younger sisters. The other family members live far away and we felt that asking them to take a day off of work to drive several hours for a wedding that was mostly just for legal purposes was pointless and unfair, especially since we will be having a big wedding in a year.   When her cousin asked, we didn't know she knew and assumed it was confusion since it was asked in such a way that that made sense. We were maintaining what we thought they all knew as the truth.   Our omission was meant to save feelings and avoid hurting people. We also felt that, if we chose to share it, doing so at her other cousin's wedding was not the place.   The life lesson is that you can take way more than you think and being able to share that shows what a strong person you are.   My wife and I have been married for four months and together four and a half years. We had just begun planning our wedding when we found out that she was set to lose her financial aid for school. We talked to my parents and her mom and they all understood that unless we got married, my wife had to drop out. We didn't want anyone to know since it happened really fast and we couldn't afford to invite anyone. It was in the middle of the day on a Wednesday so no one could have really made it anyway. In an effort to avoid hurt feelings we only had our immediate families there. We put on Facebook that we were engaged.  My wife's sister, who was 18 and pregnant at the time, instead scheduled a doctors appointment and skipped her sister's wedding. She has tried to sabotage our relationship from the beginning; she has told both of my wife's parents terrible lies about me and has even physically attacked me before. She only knew we were getting married because she lived with my wife's mom at the time.   My wife's cousin got married this weekend and we were asked by her other cousin if we were married. We said no, as that is what we agreed upon. We found out that her sister told the family that we are in fact married. I am livid. It was not her place to do that and I'm tired of her invading my life whenever she can. My wife's father, who abused my wife and I in the past, was also not supposed to know, but we are sure she told him as well.  She is being induced this Wednesday and I have made it clear that I will not be driving two hours to her father's house to see her. My mother in law is angry that I won't do this but I can't stand my father in law or sister in law. My wife agrees but doesn't want trouble. What should I do?  Tl;dr: sister in law is an asshole and I'm expected to coddle her.   Rand Paul thinks same sex couples should just have "contracts" not marriages or unions.   /r/justneckbeardslaves   The thumbnail looks like a dick.   When twox became a default, I had discovered trollx and I unsubbed over there and never looked back.   No, not really. Men are assertive or leaders or have a take charge personality. Those are all considered positive.   You're right. *Most* people aren't, but these types of things seem to draw the creepy neckbeards out of the woodwork. It's probably too late to get enough bathroom attendants now.       ... Have you actually been on Reddit? Creepshots from conventions like this are a regular thing.      You should also probably leave out hermaphrodite as well. A hermaphrodite is truly both 100% male and 100% female which doesn't happen in humans.   Women, who push for things, are called bossy bitches.   Intersex is the word you are looking for.   Yep. Transmen are porn penis free.  Edit: not porn. Born.   I haven't really played since 2010 and I don't want to allow myself to get sucked back in.   I wouldn't say the parent is a creep but in that position I would remind my child that genital touching is to be done alone.   It's TIL, it isn't supposed to he current events.   Well that's like, your opinion man.   Oh god if I ever need something to make me childfree this is it.   This law just changed where I live. I'm a social work student and it's preposterous that until now a degree in engineering makes you qualified to be a case worker.   It may be different in Germany, but in the US ultrasounds are internal unless there is a problem or you are pregnant enough that external will work.   99% of fire departments in Pennsylvania are volunteer.   Perhaps you should consider attending a PFLAG meeting to help you come out.   It totally is! How did your mom as a nun have a child? I assume she was not a nun before you so how did she decide to be come a nun? How old were you? How has it affected you? What are some weird rules nuns have to follow? My uncle is a monk and they can't dance with women. Where is your dad? It is REALLY interesting.    No, it wouldn't. In that case it is not sexually transmitted. If you rim someone with cholera you can get cholera but that doesn't make it an sti.   Congratulations, pain in the butt!    If you don't want the kid to be a brat, stop humble bragging. Don't teach that behavior.    Maybe you should be more grateful for gifts and less controlled by your husband.   Do an AMA!   Thank you, kind stranger, who knows one fact about my relationship.    Actually she's sitting next to me at Friendly's across from my Nigeria best friend.   She's gay. I can say with 100% certainty that she's never banged a dude.   I'd be risking my relationship if she realized too late that she can't handle it. She doesn't want to sleep with anyone else.   Hey baby. You dropped something. My jaw.   I was 15 and it was also too soon.   I didn't save myself for marriage, but my wife and I started dating when I was 15. She knows that I totally want to sleep with other people and I have her permission to explore. I just love her too much to risk it all for an hour of fun.    No, I think women just want someone experienced. I'm a lesbian. I would not sleep with or date a virgin. There is just too much responsibility in making sure you don't fuck their first time up. Maybe it's because women put more emotional value in virginity loss and to men it's more of an accomplishment.  All my opinions based on generalizations of course.    For real. Best tweezer I ever lost* were a dollar from ELF.  *I lose all tweezers.   If you hate everyone, why watch?   I seriously hope someone beat you to the punch.   That's the best part of neckbeards!   I live a few hours from Philly, where the Mazzoni(sp?) center is, which is where most of my friends got their T. I keep thinking about using some of this money to do that, but I didn't think I wanted hormones right now.   I have round about discussed being trans with my mom and she is 100% not on board. My dad makes comments about transpeople that say he is the same. My wife would be fine with it, as we have discussed it at length, but we currently live with my parents.   I'm just really not sure where I am right now on all of this and it sucks. I generally don't bother to bind because it doesn't really work anyway but when I do my dysphoria is all but gone. I am open with my whole family about the fact that top surgery is an inevitability and they all seem okay with it as I've explained it that my chest is too big, but a reduction can put me at higher risk for cancer so they're on board.   I'm sorry if this is all over the place but any insight would help.   Reddit doesn't seem to understand that choice is just that - choice. The hive mind says that it's our decision (as almost an entirely male population) who has to have an abortion. They don't believe women should have the choice to *not* abort.   Stepping up to take care of family members he doesn't have to = chump.   I'd hate to be related to you.   True, but Hillary is an old dog in the game. She's been around longer.   I agree but someone super left won't get elected.    She changed her position on that issue. On a personal level, she doesn't feel that "marriage" is the best word but she doesn't politically believe in taking away other's rights.    I haven't shaved since December and will maybe shave two more times this year. I don't grow body hair quickly and it's thin and blonde when I do. I'm more masculine anyway so screw it. My wife has PCOS and grows hair so fast you can hear it. She Nairs every other week and I only hate when it's in the stubble stage.    Your welcome for the new fetish. Seriously though could you imagine Elizabeth Warren as President with Rachel Maddow as our first lady?   I've told my wife that I would leave her for Elizabeth Warren. She said that's fine as long as she can have Rachel Maddow. Elizabeth Warren is going to be president someday, I firmly believe, but that day is not today. She is just too wonderful for the right to go for it.   Aside from her last name, why not her?   And the right would say it was a cat fight and neither would get elected. I don't think having two women from the left run at the same time for our first female president is going to be a good idea.   A vote for a third party is a waste of your vote. You know it won't actually go anywhere, better to go for the better of the two evils.   Disclaimer: I'm left than left and love Elizabeth Warren.  She is too left. Hillary is much more moderate and older, helping to secure votes. She is a known name and not for rocking the boat out right on things that people more right don't want rocked. Elizabeth Warren can't secure the votes because she is too young and too new and too left for the comfort of most. I also doubt that she will run and step on Hillary Clinton's toes to try to be the first female president, which I personally find admirable. If they both run, the right will construe it as a sexist cat fight and that will make them both lose.   Personally, I'm voting for Hillary Clinton because I like her and what she stands for.   It's against reddiquette to post personal information.    I graduated in 2012 in the Poconos. I was on the rifle team and it still exists, shooting .22 rifles in the range on school grounds.   Well being is affected by the law though in this case.   Typically in video games, when the player gets frustrated and flips out and quits playing.   When you ask someone out, it's assumed that you will pay and it makes you look cheap not to.    At first I thought maybe you were a troll, but I checked your profile out and apparently you are rage quitting. Isn't there somewhere more entertaining to do that?   Want to see my skin that has had maybe a dozen pimples in my lifetime that looks even better since following my routine? Didn't think so, but I thought I'd offer.   Guys listen up we have a skincare genius in our midst.   I think that grouping other people that way is wrong and counterintuitive but when people group themselves a certain way it's not really wrong to theorize why. I'm not saying that a transman is the same as a woman or vice versa but there is a common element.   And femme lesbians for being invisible and passing as straight.    Transpeople are certainly their transitioned-to gender from birth, but transmen experience objectification by men from a young age and transwomen are told that trucks and sports are what they need to be in to. They experience society as their assigned sex until transition, when they experience it from their gender.    Well, people are socialized as children based on their assigned gender. That's a pretty common theme.   From what I've seen, you're correct. Afab people like tumblr because it's more pro afab people, where reddit is more amab oriented.    That's like saying men aren't privileged because of Women's colleges and whites aren't privileged because there are Black Student Unions or straights aren't privileged because of gay bars.  Edit: I'm not saying my answers are right, just that groups are definitely privileged. I don't think it's possible to prove that masculine gay men are not the most privileged group of lgbt people, aside from perhaps straight transmen that pass extremely well.   I'm a genderqueer lesbian, so my perspective is skewed, but here is how I see it:  Gay men, particularly masculine bear types on top; rather "normal" and the male privilege to boot. Feminine gay men are a close second.  Lesbians, femme on top with varying degrees of butch behind them.   Then, we have branches. Transmen get male privilege when they pass but all the medical advances really give transwomen the privilege, so it is really about which matters more to the individual. As a whole, society doesn't love transpeople.   Bi people fall within their respective gay/straight depending upon their relationship at the time, though they deal with erasure based on their relationships. If they are with someone they are immediately either gay or straight and whores if they are single or have multiple partners.    Totally easy; pigtails = avoid; spikes = new best friend.   Not a chart, but a summary.   Everyone (gay and straight) call bi people whores, so they don't like anyone.  Lesbians don't like bi people because of too many "bi" girls who just want to experiment. This fuels bi hatred of lesbians because they claim it is "bi erasure".  Transpeople think that everyone hates them so they hate everyone first. Straight people think they are just really gay, gay people think gender and sexuality shouldn't be lumped.  Gay men hate more feminine gay men for being attention whores.  Lesbians don't like straight men because they feel objectified; straight men in turn feel that lesbians try to out-masculinize them.   I think that's about it.   Actually, they *can* just let you hang free. They don't tell boys to wear briefs to make their nuts look better.   No. Trans*vest*ites wear the clothes. Trans*gender* people are the gender.   No need! I was just confused at first that I thought I fixed it and it was back and then I was confused that four minutes later I got another notification about it lol.   Did you even look to see that someone else already told me lol?   http://np.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/329wdj/trans_mtf/  Per mod request as self post.      *^ this is why transguys get annoyed on here.    Edit: you can't take criticism and he is trolling? Bullshit.   If you rent your landlord can lose their house for your possession. You have to buy somewhere so a deal gone bad *can* happen. Regardless of what you want to be true, most drugs *are* illegal so yes, that's an issue. Because of that major difference, you cannot realistically draw a comparison with drinking and gambling.    Maybe he opted as an adult to be circumcised because of phimosis.   Just support your guy. My wife's father hates me. We have been together 4.5 years but his 2 year relationship to his 2nd/4th wife is more valid than ours. I avoid her father because he is awful.   If the nurse at school ever did that to my child we would have a MAJOR issue.   I down voted you. It *is* still a problem. You put the entire household at risk if you are caught. You run the risk of falling back into addiction instead of just use. You risk a deal gone bad and your mother coming to identify your body. If you have children you put their lives and sense of normalcy at risk. It's not "fine".   Call and find out! Worst they can say is  no!   McDonald's carries them now!   He sort of fumbled and wasn't sure what to say but I was like beaming. It's the first time it's happened and I was just thrilled    3 seconds without dank memes.   And you won't be bored because you can watch the bubbles!      I crave Italian food so much when I have my period. Though, at first I thought this was a horrible marinara sauce joke.   My wife and I went to Olive Garden for dinner tonight for our 4 months married/4.5 years together anniversary. I was holding the door for a couple coming out and the man called me sir! I wasn't even trying to pass, just wearing a striped shirt and sports bra over Levis and he called me sir! Then he corrected himself but who cares because I got called sir!   With the added benefit of lacerations!   Health care for everyone? Removal of DADT? Federally recognized same sex marriage?   So its like your dad was Danny Devito and your hubby is Arnold Schwarzenegger but they are actually secretly twins?   The problem is that a lot of dads really do this and it's not a good thing.   Sadly, yes, plenty of them are. Though, if you recognize this I'm guessing you aren't.    Hey, if you didn't do it, don't feel bad. But work to combat the behavior in your loved ones that a male.   That's not a great mentality to have, either. You don't own them any more than another man does. They own their own bodies. Yes, when they are young and don't know any better you need to protect them, but they aren't your objects either.    I agree. But she isn't stupid. She must know that exactly that is going to happen. She is still making the choice to do it. That doesn't make the actions of the guys here okay, but it is still her body and her choice.   It's a start. Generally my comments on defaults are down voted to hell. Maybe someone will realize that it's true in all situations.    I'm gonna let you go back and reread.   How is it anti feminist? Her body, her choice.    Really, slavery only existed about 150 years ago. That could mean that your great great grandparents had slaves, meaning someone not as distant as you think. Also, slavery ending wasn't racism ending. Schools were only forced to integrate a bit more than 60 years ago; I'm 20 and my dad was born before schools were integrated. That's no reason to apologize for someone else's actions, but it wasn't as long ago as it should have been, and knowing that hits a little closer to home.    I'm 20 and married, to another woman. It's double the screaming ovaries and the "well we are married..." but we also have no degree and live with my parents and it has to wait but try to tell all these ovaries that.    Be careful with Capella. It's like University of Phoenix and often you can't get a job because you went there. The degree isn't worth the paper it's written on.   I, too, breathed out my nose.   That's not a relationship and the fact that you call it one goes on to prove your insecurity.    It has nothing to do with ratio. It has to do with peace and quiet. There are 6 people in my three bedroom house. There is no where that is calm and quiet but the bathroom.   I screwed up royally and dropped 18 credits this semester due to my mom being diagnosed with cirrhosis and my being depressed and a whole host of other issues.  I had previously dropped 9 credits and repeated 3 of them. I have 25 credits complete of 52 attempted at this point and am working on my appeal. If I retake classes, does that lower my attempted number? Right now I know I need 30 credits in the next semester to get it back, which is impossible. Do I get a year or just a semester? Should I repeat classes? It's a 2 year program.   You are aware that this sub is an ama sub not change my view, correct? I am in no way obligated to debate my identity with you.  	136
 As a native Kentuckian, it really sucks living in pretty much the only oasis of liberal politics in the sea of Republicans and Tea Party crazies ...   Well, what happens now largely depends on you and your girlfriend. If your girlfriend is asexual (although it seems possible that she's in the gray-area), that doesn't necessarily mean that you can no longer sustain a relationship, but you will have to make some decisions as a couple.  First, she probably needs some time to figure out how she feels about sex. Just because someone is asexual doesn't mean they won't ever have sex; there is a lot of variation among aces, just like with everyone else. Some aces can't stand sex and don't ever want to have it. Others are pretty neutral toward it and don't really care either way. Others actually do enjoy sex. The key to asexuality is not necessarily that the person doesn't have an interest in sex (although this is pretty common), just that they don't experience sexual attraction. It is possible that your girlfriend will still have sex with you, or perhaps she will decide that she's not comfortable with that. It's up to her. Just give her time, don't pressure her into making up her mind right away, and make sure to respect her decision when she does make it.  Now on to you. It seems like you have a real problem with the idea that your girlfriend might not be sexually interested in you. A lot of people with asexual partners have similar issues, probably because in general sexual attraction is seen as a prerequisite for love in our culture. People typically develop a physical attraction and then a romantic one, or both happen simultaneously, so if you find out that your partner isn't physically attracted to you it can make you seriously question the legitimacy of your relationship. If I would hazard a guess, I'd say that this might be part of why you are feeling hurt right now. That's okay. This sort of thing can be difficult to handle. However, I just want you to be aware that for asexual people, a lack of physical attraction does not mean that they love you any less. They just love you in a different way.  I hope that this helps, feel free to ask any other questions. Hopefully you and your girlfriend will also be able to figure things out, and good luck in the future.   Lol that was definitely a wise decision on your part. My roommate suggested that and he got sooooo much hate mail for it.   Yeah, if you ship Irene and Sherlock you will be torn apart on Tumblr. There are so many fans who will viciously defend the Johnlock ship because they have to protect their cute gays and womenz are just a distraction. Strangely enough, though, nearly all the fanatic Johnlock fans are cishet women ....   Yep. That's one of my biggest issues with the show. It really sucks that the writers are deliberately feeding into the way that the fans ship the two of them together, all of which is just exploitative and really icky if you ask me.   I imagine that a lot of trans* people also have clothes dysphoria, but I don't really consider myself transgender or genderqueer or anything really past crossdressing, because that dysphoria doesn't extend to my body. I'm actually pretty apathetic about being physically female. I identify as female because it's convenient, but if tomorrow I woke up male I wouldn't really care that much.  Also, I'd definitely say that she was in complete denial about her own bi/homophobia. A lot of people just don't realize that stuff like that is totally prejudiced. And no, your orientation has nothing to do with your partner's orientation - that's basically implying that you and your partner aren't separate people with your own individual tastes. That's silly. More accurately, your orientation might conflict with your partner's gender identity, but gender identity and sexual orientation aren't the same thing. Some people believe that orientation only relates to physical characteristics, so someone who is a heterosexual woman is attracted to penises, and therefore to be "straight" they can only date cis men. I think that's a little off, because trans men are still men and trans women are still women, so you can be straight even if you date trans people, assuming that they identify as the opposite gender. Perhaps this is what she was really referring to? But even in that case it's still shitty because it's transphobic. Either way, she's not being fair to you.  I can also relate to that idea of coming to terms with being a part of the LGBT community. I think part of the problem is that queer communities can be just as hierarchical as the general population. Plus, often times people who don't fit into the prescribed narrative of what it means to be "gay" or "trans" or whatever are ostracized. A lot of people try to argue that asexuals aren't really queer, for instance, because we are just "acting like we're special for attention" or "because we aren't really discriminated against" or because we have passing privilege. There's also unfortunately a lot of gay, cis people who don't like including other identities and orientations in the queer rights movement because they make things "too complicated." Too bad human beings are all really complicated and none of us fit perfectly into neat little box.   Um ... that's not what I was talking about. Of course there are different interpretations of what Sherlock's actual orientation is. I'm referring to how the show constantly makes gags about "SHERLOCK AND JOHN TOTALLY LOOK LIKE A GAY COUPLE HAR HAR"   I'm mostly happy with who I am too, it's just the occasional nagging in the back of my brain. But it's about the same as other people thinking things like "If only I could shed a few pounds" or "If only I were good at sports" etc.   Yeah, the only time I ever play COD or Halo is with people I know IRL that aren't total assholes.    I dunno. Honestly shit like that is basically why I will never really get into fighting games or FPS. I'm just not that great at them to begin with, and putting up with that sort of harassment and constant sexism is too exhausting.  I will take anybody on at Galaga, though! :   Yeah, I often think things like "It would be easier if I were straight" or "I wonder if my SO would find our relationship more fulfilling if I were a better sexual partner." It can be hard not to criticize yourself for any number of things that are outside of your control, especially your sexuality.  At the end of the day, though, I just have to accept myself for who I am. I can't change myself and become allosexual just by wishing it, and getting to preoccupied with "if only"s only causes you more stress. So I try my best to just be happy with the way I am.   Well, first I just wanna say that you've been through a really rough time and that sucks. I'm a panromantic asexual (ugh trying to explain that is so ridiculous). I'm female-bodied and identify as a woman, although I also frequently cross-dress, have a lot of "masculine" traits, and people usually assume I'm a butch lesbian. I've never had body-related dysphoria, but I have felt some dysphoria about wearing female clothes or makeup - I'm always uncomfortable, and I feel like I'm wearing a costume, not being myself. So I can certainly relate to a lot of what you're going through.  Secondly, liking someone who is queer doesn't make you not straight. My SO is hetero, dating a queer woman doesn't suddenly make him queer too. That is a really terrible excuse to break up with someone.  After having multiple people break up with you over this, all I can do is offer you my deepest sympathies. I know that it seems like you'll never find someone to accept you, but at the very least you don't make me uncomfortable and I won't judge you, and there's plenty of other nice internet folks out there who feel the same. It might help if you find a few friends that accept you, even if you can't find a partner right now.  I recently participated in an LGBT therapy group. We had a good mix of genders and orientations. Together we all were able to work out some of our anxieties, and it really helped all of us to know that there were other people struggling just like we were. If you can find a similar therapy or support group in your area, I would highly recommend trying to attend.  Finally, I just want to affirm that *you are not a freak*. There is nothing wrong with your orientation or gender being what it is. There are plenty of people out there just like you. Calling yourself a freak is an insult to all the awesome pan and trans* people out there! I know when you're depressed it's really hard to push away ugly thoughts like that, but I really hope that you can learn to deal with them and they won't take over.  Well I've rambled on long enough, but I hope that what I've said can help you, even if it's just a teeny bit. Feel free to PM me anytime if you just need someone to listen. You're not alone, okay?   It seems like you kinda answered your own question. "This is frustrating!!" After all, that's what most people really mean to say when they shout "that's so gay" while gaming.   Too bad Sherlock is also full of blatant gay-bating. :/   Well, there are a lot of shows that you can make the case for a character being asexual (Sherlock, The Big Bang Theory, Community, etc.) but the main problem is that none of them openly identify as asexual and many of those same characters are also written as if they have some form of mental illness (Sherlock is bipolar, the rest are usually some form of autistic).   I would probably be a lot more excited about this if it weren't so cheesy ... /forever writing snob/   Never read the comments. NEVER READ THE COMMENTS   And by "friend" you mean "asshole that is no longer a friend," yes?   This was basically my first poly experience in a nutshell. My SO started dating a woman who was already seeing two other guys, and the rest of them all treated me kind of shitty because the group dynamic centered around her, and since I wasn't dating her I was seen as an outlier, and therefore my feelings or opinions had the lowest priority.   First, yes, demisexual is a real thing. I'm ace, I know a lot of demis. Just throwing that out there.  But on to the poly stuff. I'm just not a jealous person, but rather extremely pragmatic, so I've never had an issue with that aspect. I do, however, take issue with deception or breaking boundaries. I think it really helps if you and your SO keep up constant, open, and honest communication. You should probably talk to him about your jealousy. Even if you don't want him to stop dating other people, he still might be able to help you work through some of that.  Also, speaking as someone who isn't sexual but also has a male allosexual (non-ace/gray/demi) partner, I can relate to the idea that you aren't going to be getting a lot of the same things out of poly. But that's okay. Instead of focusing on what he's getting that you're not, try thinking about what you *are* getting out of this relationship setup. For one thing, if you don't really enjoy sex that much (believe me, I can relate) then the fact that your SO can pursue sex with others takes some of the pressure off of you to perform sexually. This is actually the best benefit for me with my own relationship. Also, just as sexual feelings aren't limited in poly, romantic feelings aren't limited either. It doesn't really matter if you get attached to another partner in a way that your SO doesn't with his partners. Even if he only views you as a "serious romantic relationship" partner and all the others are "casual sexual relationship" partners, that has no relation to how you might feel about other partners. You don't have to do poly his way, find a way to do poly YOUR way.  Now for some dos and don'ts:  * DO set clear boundaries. If there are things that make either of you uncomfortable, you should voice them. Don't try to drop hints or beat around the bush and hope the other person catches on. Not setting up boundaries and sticking by them can lead to someone walking all over you or taking advantage of the gray area and hurting you. This is what nearly destroyed my relationship with my SO the first time he found a paramour - I didn't set clear boundaries, so he assumed certain things were okay that were definitely not okay. * DON'T punish someone simply for having feelings. To me, one of the greatest benefits of poly relationships would be that it gives people the chance to explore their desires without fear of condemnation or negative repercussions on their current relationship. So if either of you develop feelings (romantic, sexual, whatever) for someone else, you can safely explore that without losing what you already have. Just remember that actions and feelings aren't the same, and that you generally can't change the way you feel about things just by wishing it, so there's no point in vilifying someone over it - this will only lead to resentment on both sides. * DO communicate often. I can't stress this enough. You really need to talk to your partner. Good communication helps in any relationship, but it will especially save you a lot of headache with poly relationships. Just be honest with each other. * DON'T be afraid to stand up for yourself. You don't have to be a martyr for your partner's sake. Doing things for your partner is of course part of being in a relationship, but don't neglect your own needs for "the good of the relationship." In a good relationship, your partner should be taking care of you, too. It's okay to be selfish every once in a while. The key is striking a balance between the two.  Okay, I've rambled on enough. I hope all this helps, feel free to comment or message me if you have any other questions or just wanna talk :   It's also really weird tho because a lot of the sweeter ones then say something casually that's super racist and then you just feel awkward; on the one hand they seemed really nice but on the other hand holy fuck that's racist.   Since other people already answered, I just wanted to say I hope you enjoy them both! Analogue really got to me, and Hate Plus was probably one of the better follow-ups to any VN I've read that wasn't originally written with a sequel in mind.   I'm happy that a lot of people are starting to recognize that fat-shaming is wrong, but it's really sad that as an unintended side-effect people have also started thin-shaming more and more. Any sort of body-shaming is not okay. It would be better if people could just keep their stupid comments to themselves. :   Ugh. So much ugh. I feel like I can relate, being asexual myself. It really sucks whenever guys decide to be total assholes just because you're not interested. Also, toxic people are awful. I would seriously consider trying to get that restraining order. Even if you don't think it will happen, it's worth a shot, especially since this guy is trying to get into all sorts of personal stuff about you. Stay safe, and good luck.   Yup.   That's awesome! Yay for good friends :D   I'm a senior (21, F) in college, have been with my SO (21, M) for over five years now. We both like anime, so whenever we went off to college together it seemed only natural that we both join our university's anime club. We hoped that we would meet some new friends and share our hobby with others; however, there has also been a lot of drama in this club, and just recently we were also sucked into it.  It all started about a month ago. A local theater was playing the latest Evangelion movie for a special midnight showing, and the club secretary posted on the club's facebook page that if anyone wanted to go, the club would cover the cost of their ticket - all anyone had to do was respond to the post and they would purchase their ticket for them. I couldn't go, but my SO thought it sounded like fun so he told the club president he wanted a ticket. President responded that they had a ticket for him, so he made arrangements with a friend to drive over together and everything was set. Or so he thought.  When my SO got to the theater with his friend, about 15 minutes before the movie, he found the club officers and they told him that they sold his ticket back. Of course, my SO was confused, because they had told him just the day before they had a ticket for him. But apparently, they had posted on facebook earlier that day that he had to reconfirm whether or not he was going. Since my SO doesn't live on facebook, he missed the message, and they sold back his ticket. The show was already sold out, so my SO didn't get to go and he and his friend both left.  Later he checked facebook and found the post they were referring to. In a comment at 8:41 PM, president had posted that if SO didn't respond he was giving away his ticket. For a show that night at 12. Seem a little unreasonable? My SO thought so, and responded in kind. Then the club secretary decided to rail on him, saying he was a dipshit, irresponsible, lazy, a dumbass, he's whining like a bitch, and that if he had merely texted the president this wouldn't have happened. My SO doesn't have the president's cell phone number, but the secretary did have my SO's, and by his own argument they could have just as easily contacted him. So despite secretary's long, swear-filled tirade, my SO politely informed him that perhaps they should all communicate better in the future, and that although secretary had the right to say whatever he liked, it really didn't look that good having an officer cussing out a club member on the club's public facebook page.  The club officers apparently didn't like this. President made a post (which was afterward deleted) saying that both my SO and secretary's behavior were unacceptable, and since it was everyone's club they would vote on what to do at the beginning of next meeting. SO had work, so he told the president he couldn't make it but would go along with whatever the club decided. Not that he should have bothered, since it was never brought up in meeting. The officers decided among themselves that they were just going to ban my SO, despite the fact that there was nothing in the club rules saying they could. They claimed he was banned for "disruptive behavior" because he made a scene at the movie theater, which he didn't, because my SO is probably the most shy, non-confrontational man on earth. Even then, though, his first "offense" should have only resulted in a warning - permanent bans are supposed to be given for a third offense. But they couldn't be bothered to follow their own rules and made up some bullshit, basically telling my SO that it didn't matter what he thought or wanted because they'd already decided he was out. My SO didn't have the time or energy to contest it with the school, so he let the issue drop.  I still thought the whole situation was frustrating and ridiculous, but I can't afford to make any waves on his behalf since I make a little money by selling handicrafts at local conventions. Two of the major conventions I sell at are also partly run by - you guessed it - club officers. Specifically, president and secretary. And I know that if I try to protest they'll likely find a similar excuse to ban me from their cons. Instead, I just stopped going to club.  To top it all off, one of the people I was friendly with at club who happens to work with my roommate told roomie that the officers have been gossiping about SO and me. As I suspected, they used a flimsy excuse to ban him because they don't like him. But it gets worse. According to the coworker, after club they were badmouthing both he and I at length, saying that because I'm such a feminist killjoy there's no way I'd put out for anyone, so my SO must be raping me. WTF?? Coworker told them that they went over the line, but they just ignored her and kept talking about us. I guess I shouldn't be surprised because I'm a queer woman and they've said some homophobic and sexist stuff before, but I honestly thought that we all got along well enough. That's what I get for hoping, I guess.  **TL;DR - The officers from our uni's anime club banned my SO on some bullshit pretense because they're sexist, homophobic jerks and the club is ruled by cronyism.**   Imho, playing the Sims without cheating is way too boring.   Oh wow, totally forgot about Perfect Blue. Shame on me! Lol.  In the Disney movie, Frollo really comes off as all yan and no dere, imho.   I haven't seen any. Then again I haven't seen many yandere in general.   I actually really like Sherlock and Light, though. I think part of the problem might be because women are often portrayed as overly emotional and way too needy, not to mention that women are often more likely to be diagnosed with various mental disorders, and the yandere subtype tends to feed into those negative stereotypes and perceptions. So seeing a character like Yuno that's just outright psychotic gives me a sort of icky feeling. She does, however, fit in really well with the tone of the series, so while I don't personally like her I do see why she was important to the plot.   I've always been weirded out by Yuno, but I appreciate her as a sort of antagonist I guess?  The rest I've never seen/read, except for Ranma, but I never finished that series so I guess I never got to that part, haha.   Honestly, if the character showed signs of improvement I would probably like them more. For instance, if they were super obsessive but you later learned about their back story and it provided a good reason (someone close to them died, or maybe they were abandoned?), and then as you develop the relationship they start to get better, I would probably enjoy that. Just like with tsundere - one of my favorite tsundere characters is probably Taiga from Toradora!, because as you learn more about her back story she's actually a really complex character and she grows and develops throughout the series. In general, I really just prefer characters that grow as time goes on, so if a yandere character were able to grow somewhat I'd probably like them.   No, orientation is not a choice. However, I personally take issue with the whole idea of the "born this way" or "it's biology" arguments. Of course it's highly possible that genetics plays a role, and there are probably environmental factors as well, just like with any other human condition. For instance, how do you know if someone will be an Olympic athlete? Part of it is probably good genes for whatever sport they end up in, but it also involves a lot of training. And of course, someone has the choice of whether or not they will act upon their orientation; some people try to resist their desires, because they wish to remain celibate, are closeted, etc.  To me, the whole debate about whether or not being gay (or any other form of GSRM) is a choice is moot. It really shouldn't matter if you choose to be gay or not. People should never be discriminated against because of their orientation, but rather free to explore their feelings for others without prejudice. Even if it was a choice, people should still be allowed to make that choice. If you ask me, as a U.S. citizen, I believe that our Constitution and laws are meant to protect peoples' freedoms, and if being gay were hypothetically a choice, the law should also protect that choice. After all, the law protects peoples' religion, and even though you have the ability to choose which religion (if any) to follow, many people consider their religion a core part of their identity, and people definitely shouldn't be discriminated against because of their religion. So why is not okay to discriminate against people for their religious choice, but it is okay to discriminate against people for their (perceived) orientation choice?   Well of course it eventually boils down to personal taste, but I just couldn't personally think of any (I haven't read or watched that many things with yandere characters to be honest).  I forgot about School Days, I started playing it but it ended up on the back burner so I never got that far in. Also, I thought Rena was more strictly a yangire? But I think Shion does count, now that you mention it.  All of the rest I'm not as familiar with, but I will check them out. My biggest issue is that the whole yandere archetype is based entirely upon the fact that the character is a stalker and likely crazy. It sets things up for an unhealthy relationship, which can be really problematic, but if it were written well I'd most likely be fine with it.   I was playing through Grisaia and since there is a bit of discussion in the game as to which type of -dere some of the characters are, it got me thinking. There are plenty of tsundere, kuudere, etc. characters that a lot of people seem to like, but I can't really think of any yandere characters from games or shows that I could say are likeable or genuinely popular. Can anyone else think of some?   Yes. The only problem was that the guy who fell for me was a total asshole, so there was actually no chance in hell that I would ever reciprocate and make his life actually better.   Like the others said, it would definitely dull your scissors. Not to mention I'm pretty sure that trying to cut leather (especially thick leather) with fabric scissors would be about as effective as trying to cut construction paper with safety scissors. It ain't gonna happen. You should definitely get some sort of specialized cutting implement.   I'll second this. There are plenty of poly people on OKC, and they have specific questions about non-monogamy (i.e., would you ever consider dating someone who was already in a relationship) so you can find out just from reading their profile if they'd be willing to try it out. Plus you can set your search options to "girls looking for girls."   I really liked The Royal Trap and The Second Reproduction, but [here's a list](http://visualnovelaer.fuwanovel.org/2013/07/list-of-all-english-and-english-translated-otome-games-via-otome-hearts/) of more otome (girl protag) games.   Yeah. I'm sure it's actually really common (especially if you're poly). Right now I'm in a committed relationship with my SO whom I've been dating for over five years, but I also have feelings for a girl I've been friends with since high school.   No problem, happy to help. Good luck!   I dunno, I think it would be okay if my SO already knew what he wanted to get in general but consulted the metamour for specifics. Like if he wanted to get me lingerie but wasn't sure on sizing for something and asked her for help. Basically, if he put the thought into it and knows in general what I like but she has more experience using something it would be okay. I've done the same thing for gifts I've gotten in the past - for instance, if I want to buy him electronics I'll often ask his dad or brother to help me narrow things down because they know more about electronics than I do and they know what would work best for how he wants to use it.  However, if he just asked her to pick something of course it would be cheating lol :P   Hmm. This one is a little tough. On the one hand, you and C seemed to have had mutual feelings at one point, meaning that there was (and might still be) a good chance of you getting together. On the other hand, C seems to have suddenly changed his mind. I would certainly want an explanation if I were you, so that I could figure out where to go from here - should you keep pursuing things or move on? Without more info, it's hard to tell.  Although H asking him about it may be able to get you this info, it's not necessarily likely. He might tell her the reasons (if any) or he might not. And it's possible that even if he does tell her that she will be sworn to secrecy and can't tell you. Although it might take more courage and seem a little riskier, it could be better for your to just ask C about it yourself.  Does C know about your feelings? Even if he was told indirectly through H, you should probably work up the nerve and tell him about it yourself. I would try to arrange some time where the two of you can talk face-to-face if possible so that you can tell him you like him and ask if there was any particular reason why he no longer reciprocates, as H seemed to think that he was into you too. Honesty and frankness can go a long way in these sorts of situations.  Perhaps C is worried about being in a queer relationship? I assume that this would be the case if you did get together since you're posting this in /r/askGSM. In that case, it's possible that he still does have feelings for you but is worried about the social implications of being with you. Or perhaps he's just nervous about being in a new relationship in general.  Of course it's also possible that he thought he had feelings for you but those have faded, or he's just too busy, or changed his mind, or whatever other reason people stop liking each other. But you'll never know until you talk to him about it. So I would suggest that you do that, and then go from there.  Let me know if you need any other advice, and you should update whenever you find out more :   The world we live in honestly sucks. I'm really sorry for what your friend went through, and I hope that your friend gets the support she needs, if not from the school or police than from friends and loved ones like you. I also hope nothing like that ever happens to her again. Abuse is really difficult to handle, and I know firsthand that it really sucks when everyone else tells you that you're making things up or blowing things out of proportion or it's really your fault.  I feel similar rage whenever I read internet comments on things like this. Sometimes I just wish that a meteor would hit every single asshole who's ever harassed an abuse or rape victim like this, but the universe is not that kind.   The above is only a few of the reasons I loathe the American education system.   Being pissed that someone gave you a disease is not slut shaming. Wanting your poly partner to practice safe sex is not slut shaming. Calling them a slut for wanting to have sex is slut shaming.  Your primary doesn't have a leg to stand on here. There is a difference between shaming women for their sexual desires and calling people out when they make bad decisions with objectively negative consequences. She has compromised not only her own health but your health, and of course you're allowed to be angry because of it. She's full of it, and honestly I would consider no longer being with this person. Clearly she doesn't seem to make your best interests a high priority.   Hmm. Probably not. I really like most of my guy friends, but they are not usually the guys that I would want to date, for various reasons. Thus why they are friends, and not people I'm asking out. There are maybe one or two guys I might consider going out with if they asked, but it's a pretty slim chance that a relationship would develop there.   If you no longer love your husband because he has substance abuse issues and is turning into someone who is scaring you, YOU ARE NOT A HORRIBLE PERSON. You are totally normal and justified in feeling that way. I'm sure he has his own issues, but that does not excuse any sort of violent or threatening behavior. Plus, can you really justify being with him for the sake of your kid? I'm willing to bet that being an addict severely compromises his ability to be a decent caregiver to your child.  My suggestion would be that your husband needs rehab (and also therapy). If he is totally unwilling to get help or change in any way, then you need to get out. Don't wait until it gets worse - cut ties now before something really bad happens. And you shouldn't have to give up on your bf at all - if he is supporting you in all this, I would say that you should definitely stay with him. He can probably help you with taking care of your son and anything else you need while the husband is in rehab or if you do decide to leave him.  That's what I would do, anyway. Whatever you decide to do, OP, I hope that things start to look up for you in the future. And just know that you shouldn't have to feel guilty for not loving someone who isn't there for you.   Agreed, to me ultimatums are a last resort only to be used when you reach your breaking point of things you are willing to tolerate.   No, I don't think that ultimatums are inherently manipulative. Most of the time when someone gives another person (especially their partner) an ultimatum, it tends to be because they have a really serious issue and they are tired of dealing with that person's shit. An ultimatum is less about making someone else doing what you want, and more an expression of "there is something seriously wrong here, and unless a big change happens soon this relationship will fail."  So at least imho giving an ultimatum is actually healthy for a relationship. It's a way for someone to express the problems they are having and making sure that those issues are seen as incredibly important by the other partner.  Of course, like everything else it has the potential to be misused - for instance, if someone says "if you don't propose to me within the year, we're done" but they've only been together for a month, that would be a little ridiculous. And I'm sure that in the past there have been people who have used it purely to manipulate others into doing what they want. However, in my experience an ultimatum is supposed to be a last resort. It's like having an intervention for your partner.  In that line of thought, ultimatums aren't exactly the same as having standards or "deal breakers," it's more of an expression of reaching a breaking point about what they are willing to tolerate. For instance, my parents got divorced a few years back. After talking to my mom about it, one of her standards would be that she wants someone who is emotionally supportive. A deal breaker for her in looking for a new relationship would have been anyone who is addicted to drugs or alcohol. Her previous husband (my stepdad) was neglectful and borderline emotionally abusive and he was definitely a functioning alcoholic, but she put up with these things for 13 years while they were married. She finally issued an ultimatum saying that if they didn't seek out some kind of counseling she would leave him. He didn't want to admit they had any problems and insisted that they didn't need counseling, so she left. Thankfully, now she is much happier and married to a new guy that has his shit together and takes care of her and my little sister.   So I would say that issuing an ultimatum can definitely be justified, and no, just because you give someone an ultimatum doesn't mean you're trying to manipulate them. Sometimes it's genuinely because you want to help them, but if it gets to the point that you have to issue an ultimatum to your partner odds are there are a lot of issues there and at that point it's about as likely that you'll be able to fix the issues as it is that the relationship will fail.   Yeah, assuming that you like a good variety of games, there is always something free each month that you'll like. It basically pays for itself if you keep it around long enough and download enough of the free games.   I would definitely say it's been worth it for me. I'm a college student living with two other college students and none of us has a lot of money to spend on games, but PS+ has given us several good ones that we would otherwise never have.    He has lost some weight, which is good, but I'm pretty sure it mostly has to do with the fact that he's still in his mid-20s and can get away with eating unhealthy things because he still has a relatively high metabolism. But their dad has diabetes and the food he eats has barely any nutrients, and I'm just internally going "ugh" every time we go to eat somewhere because in another five or ten years he's going to start feeling the impact of his crappy diet.   Thanks. It's not really a full-on trigger for me, but I still am not at all OK with it. But I have talked to other people who it is a trigger for and I know how that shit feels so I really try hard not to violate anyone's personal space. :/   I really liked that part too! It was certainly interesting.    I quite liked the mindfuck  Well I didn't really hate it, lol. I was just horribly confused. But as far as those sorts of scenes go it was nice ... ignoring all the plot holes and physics-defying, anyway, haha.  And yeah, everyone has their tastes. I understood the target demographic they were going for with Mink, I just personally couldn't relate because if it were me I'd be like, "Forget this guy."   DRAMAtical Murder isn't otome, but it is pretty good. Still worth a read in my opinion. I still haven't read Hatoful, my SO played it and he seemed to enjoy it but I just never got around to it.   Unfortunately, no, it's not. I've actually been wanting to make my own VNs for a long time just so I can add some diversity to the available market. But I'm a college student and I don't have a lot of free time for programming.   *Exactly*   I usually play the bad end first to get it out of the way. They're usually shorter, and it helps lessen the blow to my feels if I know that the character doesn't actually end up in whatever state of misery the bad ending puts them in.  Plus, it makes the triumph of the good endings seem so much better if you go through all the bad ones first! (see Higurashi)   Basically, yes. It's one of those things, at least imho. Honestly I probably would never have played through Higurashi if I hadn't seen the anime first and known that the writing was really good.   So, I'm not sure how popular this game is as I've never seen any online discussion of it, but I finally finished this VN and I wanted to see if anyone else has played it and how they interpret some of what's going on in the various routes and subplots.  Here are my impressions in no particular order:  * I'm a little tied between Koujaku and Clear as my favorite characters. I liked Koujaku almost despite myself. He's basically your archetypal heartthrob and the whole childhood-friends-becoming-something-more things is a little overused, but he was still a really interesting character. His Scrap scene was really intense. Also he had a really good voice actor, I think that helped a lot. Clear, on the other hand, was actually the first route I ended up on and I thought his character was also really likable and endearing. But his ending ... [](/s "the writers were pulling some real nekige bullshit there. I think they were actually challenging themselves to come up with the most depressing thing that can happen for this character. Right after proving how badass he is by stabbing his own brain and taking down the bad guy, he finally gets to be with the man he loves ... as he slowly dies and falls apart. I was cursing the game for making me cry during that scene.")  * I really don't understand the appeal of Mink, at all. [](/s "I get that they were going for a whole dom/sub relationship there, but honestly, it doesn't seem all that plausible to me that Aoba would want to seek him out again after defeating Toue considering Mink repeatedly raped him. Honestly, the only difference between what Mink was doing to Aoba versus what Trip and Virus do to him in one of the bad endings for the Ren route is that Mink is presented as a "good" guy. It seemed like they were trying to go for "yes he's a jerk sometimes but really he's understood you see because his whole family was murdered." I really don't like these types of characters, never understood why they are so popular. Having your whole family killed is bad, yes, but that doesn't justify going around raping people. Seriously.")  * Oh, and about that "true" route. [](/s "I was willing to let a lot of things slide in this game, but this is the point where I just threw my hands up and said, "WTF, Japan?" Aoba falling in love with his robot dog is one thing. I mean, it's not like the idea of love between humans and non-humans is new or totally taboo. It's in plenty of classic fairy tales like The Little Mermaid, or in modern fantasy like LotR or Eragon. I was totally willing to accept this at first. I just assumed that after the showdown with Toue, Aoba would build Ren a new, humanoid body or something. But then as the plot advanced further it was revealed that Ren is actually Aoba's split personality that somehow managed to gain an independent body. So instead of fucking a robot dog, he is now fucking the robot dog version of himself. I felt like this was stretching it, but even then I could have lived with the idea. But the thing that topped it all off was the good ending, how Sei supposedly dies and gives Ren his body. First of all, I'm not entirely sure how this is even physically possible. They never explain how Sei survived the tower collapse, nor how Ren is able to keep living on in his body even though Sei himself said that his heart was failing. Unless he was talking about his heart failing in a metaphorical sense? But I digress. Now on top of fucking his robot-dog-self, we are supposed to believe that Aoba will continue to have a relationship with his robot-dog-self inside his twin brother's body. Like, how on earth does he explain this to people considering the fact that everyone at the hospital has identified him as Sei? He is officially on record as Sei, not Ren. Does he just come home to everyone and go, "now I know that you all think this guy is my long lost twin brother, but really he's Ren, my Allmate, in a human body. Also, Ren and I are technically the same person. But don't mind us, we're just gonna go off and live happily ever after now." I really don't see that as possible.")  Well, enough ranting on my part. Despite my complaints, the game was really well made and I actually did enjoy it. I'm not sure if the "true" route is really worth pursuing, but the main four routes are all much better. Honestly, anyone will probably find something they like in one of the characters, and I really enjoyed playing through it.  TL;DR - too many spoilers to give an accurate summary, sorry :/   Also from the South, and I've kinda given up on being irritated with this because it is so common here. Most people just say it on instinct. That I usually let slide because it takes too much energy to fight it. But it still really irks me when people call me "sweetie" or "sweetheart" in a patronizing way. That is definitely not cool.   As a fellow southerner I'd say this is pretty common. It still drives me crazy though. I've never been comfortable with people hugging me, so going to parties where I don't know a lot of people and suddenly everyone wants to hug ... bleh.   Ugh, I hate these things too. For one, I was abused for over half my childhood and I am always hyper-aware of people touching me. It makes me seriously uncomfortable. But even if I'd never been traumatized, it's still really stupid to violate people's boundaries like that.  Also, people touching my head without my permission is probably my single biggest pet peeve. I keep my hair cut really short and it's pretty fluffy (especially if it just dried) and so people just come up and touch it all the time and it drives me nuts. I DON'T CARE IF YOU THINK MY HAIR LOOKS SO FLUFFY YOU WANT TO DIE, YOU ARE NOT ALLOWED TO WALK UP AND MOLEST MY SCALP WITHOUT ASKING ME.   As someone who is a picky eater (mostly because of tactile sensitivities to textures) I try really hard not to be that stupid with food. I actually do try stuff occasionally, because you can't say that you don't like it if you've never tried it. And if I try it and end up not liking it I just say "no thanks, it's not for me" and then everyone can move on. There's no need to act all ridiculous about other people eating things I don't like - especially since they could just as easily turn it around and criticize me for not liking things that they enjoy eating.  So yeah, when I meet other picky people that refuse to even try shit before going on and on about how they don't like it and then get all dramatic when you force them to try new things, it drives me nuts. For instance, my SO's older brother is literally the pickiest person I've met. His diet consists pretty much entirely of chocolate pop-tarts, chicken nuggets, plain cheeseburgers (and he only recently started adding cheese), french fries, and gold fish crackers. He irritates me so much because he absolutely refuses to even taste new things 99.999% of the time. But he's trying to be healthier and lose weight. I just want to scream at him that if you don't try to change then nothing will change, but everyone else in their family just makes excuses for him and enables him and I can't stand it.   No, they don't have to be exactly the same. After all, if we tried to put everything to a standard of being exactly the same we wouldn't even have common experiences between individual queer people, even those of the same orientation and identity and race and social class and religion and everything else. Because all human beings are different to some degree and have different experiences to some degree.  I feel like the comparison between certain specific things like you mentioned is a lot more valid, like the fact that interracial marriage wasn't acceptable but is now, so why can't same-sex marriage? That's a relatively equivalent comparison. But not comparing the entire queer experience to the entire black (or other person of color) experience, because once again this ignores intersectionality and how people who face multiple systems of oppression are going to have their own set of unique issues.   Clearly you don't understand how sexism works, and I really fail to see how anything you say is still relevant to the discussion at hand.   The only thing you will learn from whether your son likes trucks or Barbies is which toy he'd like to play with at that particular moment.   Good on you for getting far away from that crazy. It sucks that you have to lose such a close friend, but friends like that probably aren't worth having.   human semen contains prostaglandins, which are responsible for cervical ripening  That was the part I was talking about. That part doesn't seem to be in question. And in my summary I did say that it MIGHT help induce labor, not that it definitely did. I didn't really find all of the breast stimulation stuff relevant to the discussion at hand.   Biologically, yes, parts of my body are capable of bearing children. But that is not the entirety of my being or existence. Just like how yours isn't to go around impregnating women 24/7. One of the benefits of living in social groups is that people have a lot more things to do than than eat, sleep, fuck.   From my experience, people are willing to pay a little more for something that's personal or unique for them. So that line of thinking isn't bad by any means.   Technically, no, attraction alone shouldn't be a crime. However, molesting or raping children is a crime. Comparing being gay to pedophilia or bestiality is flawed. Many religious people have made this comparison to say that all of these behaviors are morally wrong, but children and animals are incapable of giving consent to sexual acts. Adult human beings can. Thus, two adult people of the same gender having consenting sex is not comparable to an adult that engages in sex acts with children.   Oh, okay, that makes more sense. I hope they enjoy their gifts!   I would hope so! Seriously, just because it isn't sexual doesn't make it less awkward or creepy!!   Although the comparison to pedophilia is obviously flawed and once again tolerance does not mean allowing hate speech, this guy's song did raise one good point - people really shouldn't compare the struggle that GSRM people go through for rights to the struggle that racial minorities go through for rights so flippantly. Yes, both groups have been oppressed, but not always in the same ways, and they are not the exact same thing. Not to mention that saying "gay is the new black" basically erases all the struggles that queer people of color go through.   Actually, having sex with fluid contact during pregnancy can be healthy - semen can soften the cervix, which is important because it reduces the risk of complications during birth. It might also help to induce labor, if necessary.  [Sauce](http://www.aafp.org/afp/2003/0515/p2123.html)  That said, if the idea makes you uncomfortable you shouldn't have to do it, and especially considering how it might impact a fetus you should make sure that you, your girlfriend, and the other couple all get screened for STDs.   But the Tagalongs are objectively better.   I'm a little confused. You said they were for Gryffindor, but the pictures look like you used purple and yellow yarn but Gryffindor colors are red and purple. Is it just bad lighting in the photos? Also I have no idea what the snake has to do with Gryffindor in particular as it's the symbol for Slytherin House.   Definitely! Randomly touching people is just not okay, period - it doesn't matter what gender or sexuality anyone is.   A lot of gay guys I've met (or that my friends have had run-ins with) basically assume that they're allowed to critique women's bodies as much as they want, or grope women whenever they feel like, because "relax, I'm gay! I'm not a threat because I don't want to sleep with you."  I guess a lot of them don't realize that just because they aren't attracted to women doesn't mean that they aren't potentially threatening. After all, rape and sexual assault isn't about attraction, it's about power. I'm glad that you realize that even a gay man still has some power over a woman.   In society women are treated as if their only important functions are to be a sex object or bear children. Otherwise, we don't matter. Just because a guy isn't attracted to women doesn't mean he thinks any better of them than a straight man.  Fortunately, though, at least some of them seem to be cluing into this and I've seen a lot of gay men speaking up about their own misogyny and how to end it.   Generally I try to come up with my own patterns for things. Sometimes I'll have close friends say "I found this pattern, will you make it for me?" and I'll only charge them a little extra plus materials cost, but I also sell online and at conventions. On my Etsy shop and at cons I won't sell something made from a pattern unless I get permission from whoever made the pattern. A lot of times in the pattern copyright the original creator will specify whether or not it's okay to sell finished pieces made from their patterns.  As far as photos taken from things you make, even if you didn't design the pattern, I'd say that's okay. It's like building a portfolio - you're showing off your skill and technique. To make a comparison, photographers make money selling their prints all the time, even if they didn't make the thing they're photographing (buildings, animals, etc.) because the part they're selling is the *photograph*, which takes skill and effort.  As far as pricing goes, for larger projects I usually charge by the week, medium projects by the day, and small projects by the hour. For instance, if I make an accessory that only takes about 2 hours to make, I'll charge around $15 (minimum wage where I live is about $7.50, I worked two hours on it, it's tiny enough that I don't care about materials). If it takes me a weekend to finish a scarf, I charge about $25 (estimating $5 for yarn and $10 for each day). If it's a bigger project like the pillows or bags I've made, I'll charge about $10 per week plus materials.  It's basically a sliding scale. I still want to make money for all the effort I put into something, but I also want to keep it from becoming so ridiculously expensive that no one will buy it. For instance, I once made someone a sweater for a costume. I probably put 70+ hours into that sweater. But I wasn't about to charge them per hour, as that would have become a $500 sweater. No one will pay that.   Honestly, I'd agree with the whole sentiment of "only they are responsible for what happens between the two of them." This girl's boyfriend does not own her - she is capable of making her own decisions about who she wants to be with. If he can't handle that, then perhaps they aren't meant to be together. But that's up to the two of them.  You are totally separate from them. What you do with this girl is not up to the boyfriend, it's up to you and her. Of course there are potential consequences for anything you do, but it seems to me like you're coming at this from the perspective of "If I act on my feelings for her and she and her boyfriend break up, it will be my fault." In reality, if she is poly and her boyfriend is mono, that mismatch will be why they break up, not necessarily because of anything in particular you do. Some people just aren't sexually or romantically compatible.  To look at it a different way, imagine if there was a man and a woman who were together, but the man realized at some point he was gay and although he certainly cared for his female partner, he realized he would much rather be with another man he had connected with. Would it be the second man's fault if the first man and the woman broke up? No, it would merely be an unhappy circumstance. People can't control their sexuality or who they fall in love with, so if this girl you like and her bf end up separating that's not on you, it's just an unhappy circumstance.   If you want to, and you feel comfortable enough, I don't see any reason why you shouldn't come out to your mom. It seems like a pretty good time, if she's already asking you questions about your orientation.  The best way I've found to do it is to just automatically take people to a website like the AVEN FAQs or the Huff Post series on asexuality, since practically no one knows what asexuality even is. It really helps if you have an official(ish) definition and more formal explanations about how this stuff works because people are less likely to brush you off as being confused or making it up to feel special or some other bullshit. Also, answering the same questions over and over gets pretty tiring so it's usually a lot better if they can get background info first and then ask you more specific questions.   Speaking as someone who's mom just recently got remarried, I know why you would definitely worry about your kids. I'm 21, but I'm the oldest out of three - my youngest sibling is 12. So far though, neither myself nor my sister has had any problems. My brother (17) has, but he's got problems with everyone in general so that wasn't surprising.  But I digress. What I'm trying to get at is that you'd be surprised how easily kids acclimate to this sort of thing. Assuming that everyone's kids likes all the other parents and kids, this sort of thing really shouldn't be that hard. It won't be much different than my situation. I have three dads now, basically, it's just that my mom is only currently with one of them. If she decided to get back together with either my previous stepdad or my actual dad, the only thing that would change is I wouldn't have to make three trips if I wanted to see everyone.  Basically as long as it won't cause any legal issues as far as custody of your kids, I wouldn't worry too much about this. Kids are really flexible, and it's not like they'll lose out on attention if they suddenly gained two more parents. They'll probably enjoy it. But you should certainly talk to them about it at some point.  Edit: wrote down the wrong age for my brother, I can't math today   Wow, that is kind of a shitty situation. And you're right, it's not really anyone's fault, it just sorta happened.  If it were me I probably wouldn't tell Ann just because if she doesn't really need to know I can't see a reason to make her upset too. But other than that I would definitely try to just move on and do better next time. It seems like Beth understands that you wouldn't purposefully do something that would make her uncomfortable and you wouldn't have done it had you known she was awake. So yeah, icky feelings and all that but you can't change the past, you can only try to do better and not make the same mistake again in the future.  My suggestion would be that if you are going to have Ann over again would be to perhaps find a way for Beth to stay somewhere else (go visit a friend or family maybe) or perhaps invest in a pair of ear plugs.   To be fair though, it's still pretty shitty to tell someone that's bisexual that they can't be bisexual because they're actually a confused gay or straight person. It's ok to be confused, and it's ok to be flexible. But you should never tell someone their identity can't exist because it doesn't fit into a neat little box.   There is a lot in that series that can be horrifically taken out of context, tbh.   I understand genderbinary stuff, what I never could understand though is how people also assume that you can only be straight or gay and there is no wiggle room. There have been queer people since ancient times who were accepted by the society they lived in as normal. Yet somehow people seem to have forgotten that. Even in modern science, though, the last fifty or sixty years of psychological research has been full of examples of studies showing the range of human sexuality. So why do people still assume otherwise? It makes no sense to me. :/   I would say that there isn't really a problem with you attending clubs or events as an ally. You mentioned that you got involved with a friend of yours who is trans - I'm sure that person really appreciates that they have an awesome friend who will support them with this stuff.  To me it sounds like you're an average straight guy who is really comfortable with himself, as well as other people who are different from you, and that's not a bad thing by any means. I've had a lot of friends in the past who said that they were accepting of the fact that I'm queer, but they never really want to go to events with me or talk about it or probably even think about it. They accept my personality, but really my identity and community makes them uncomfortable. I'd be quicker to call those people phony than you.  As long as you don't try to claim you're something you're not, or go to events that are meant to be safe spaces for queer people only (support groups, for example), or try to assert your thoughts or opinions as more important than the queer people around you, there's no reason why you shouldn't help out and support them.   I feel you, teenage years are rough. I never came out to most of the people I knew in school, and didn't have much internet access either so I didn't really find out about other asexual people until I was already your ate. It sucks. Also, once again proof to all the nay-sayers about how "gay people have it worse because at least if your asexual none of the religious people are going to tell you you're going to hell." Yeah, right.  The good news is, pretty soon you'll be a legal adult and you can go away for college or find a job in another town and start over with your life away from all those assholes.   Whenever I first saw it this is basically what I thought. My interpretation was that she was genuinely startled by that guy and didn't really mean to kill him but considering she just found a pillow full of the hair from one of her father's victims it's totally understandable that she would freak out and kill someone who snuck up on her while she was horrified and hyperaware.  Although I interpreted what Hannibal said to her as "This looks really bad and people are going to assume you murdered him" more than "You just murdered him." Of course, it's been a while since I haven't rewatched since it aired. What Hannibal said actually made a lot of sense and he was probably right - a jury would have a hard time believing that Abigail didn't mean to kill him, especially considering her dad was a serial killer and the guy was harassing her and her friend earlier. However, he was also definitely using the situation to his advantage so that he could further manipulate and isolate Abigail.   I frequently buy ICEEs when going to a movie in the middle of winter. I have never once gotten sick. That's like saying you'll catch a cold if you go out while your hair is wet. Pretty sure there is no hazard since *you're in a warm building while drinking it.*   I can say that after playing like 20+ hours of Sherlock Holmes games these last few days that I definitely appreciate this.   I will admit that I often get confused by riddles. Lol   Honestly though I don't know why so many people assume that if you're bi/pan you must just be confused or still in the "questioning" phase. Sure, there are probably lots of people who are confused about their sexuality but there are more than two orientations .   I don't know how soon you plan on having the surgery, but if it won't be for a few months you should probably find a psychologist who is trained in  exposure therapy and have them help her out. It's a really effective treatment for things like phobias or OCD. It would probably help her freak out less because she can work her way up to it rather than going from totally fine to nightmare mode right away.   Yeah, that sounds about right.   Well I thought I made that clear in my initial comment, but I guess not. But essentially yes, he was being an ass about it. I tried to simplify the story for the sake of space but I suppose that was a bad move on my part. If it helps, he also tried to insinuate that my not liking his "joke" was because I was PMSing, so yeah I think it's safe to say he was in the wrong.   I legit asked my SO to buy me a ring like [this one](http://www.titanium-buzz.com/piston-wedding-ring.html?productid=piston-wedding-ring channelid=FROOG utm_source=CSEs utm_medium=GoogleShopping utm_campaign=TitaniumBuzzCSE). He wouldn't go for it.      My main expectation across the board is that my partner doesn't try to pressure me or guilt trip me into having sex. I'm asexual; not only do I have a complete lack of sex drive, but I also take quite a while to get comfortable enough with a person that I would be willing to have sex with them for their pleasure.  Other than that, I really prefer that the person is honest with me about STD risk, that we always use some form of protection, and that they are willing to communicate freely about what they want from the relationship as far as preferences or potentially other partners.   Sure, I wouldn't mind. It doesn't bother me at all. I know that a lot of women (from what they've told me) sometimes feel insecure dating bi guys because they don't just have to worry about women potentially "stealing their man," but they have to worry about him leaving her for a man as well.  Really though, I've never been a jealous person and it's never been an issue for me. Plus it would be rather hypocritical of me to forgo dating a bi man since I'm panromantic.    Also, speaking as someone who lives in the U.S. South, the term has a different meaning here ...  	106
 They fist bumped.    Homework always takes priority over Smash, that's the first thing I told him. :) I'll let him play for a while, and when I think it's time, that's when we'll get serious.    Indeed. We asked about just having 4 players vs. 4 CPUs, but she was instructed only to do normal Smash.   Luckily, there was still a lot of fun to be had with normal 4-player. Wii Fit Trainer dittos and the Gamer stage were highlights.    Lucky. We weren't allowed to use 8-Player Smash at ours.    We'll be playing SSB4 together mostly every day for at least 2 months, so we'll likely be practicing a lot. I told him there's math behind the game as well, so he can use that as an excuse if he wants to.    So, just some quick background here:  I'm by no means the best player. I've played with competitive level players, and I'm always coming out in 2nd or worse. So, it's no big surprise I wasn't doing well.   Then there's my brother, who's turning 10 a few days before SSB-Wii U drops. He's by all definitions a casual. He mostly spends time in Brawl spamming Toon Link's dair yelling "DUCKTALES!". So, he tagged along when I went to GameStop, hoping to try out the new game.   There was a group of people that were competitive-level players who were trashing everyone, including me. So, my little brother secretly asks to use my controller so he can play against these guys, and I agreed. They never bothered to look at who was playing.  The two guys both chose Pit, and my brother the Villager. There was a Diddy Kong somewhere, but he died pretty early. Items on, 3 stocks, Palutena's Temple.   Fast forward to near halfway through. Diddy's gone, and everyone has one stock. The Daybreak item begins to appear. One of the Pits manages to grab two, and the final piece spawns behind my brother. This is when I begin to watch him more carefully. He quickly plants a tree near the Daybreak, and one Pit doesn't see it. He rushes towards the piece, and then BAM. My brother finishes him off with a final blow using the tree.   My brother pockets the piece and runs. The final Pit, with the other two pieces, begins to rush towards him. What I saw my brother do, this filthy casual who likes to spam attacks and then Kirbycide 90% of the time, really made me proud of him.   He used Lloid Rocket to space himself decently from the player, and did nothing but constantly avoid the grasp of him by rocketing from one platform to the other, and sometimes using Balloon Fight. He planted trees to create walls in order to get some time. At one point, he landed on the bridge and destroyed it right as Pit landed on it using his Weed Pluck D-Tilt. He continually attacked using the slingshot, and managed to grab nearly every single  arrow this guy threw and shoot it right back. The guy was screaming "Get over here, stop running away! It's my Daybreak!" After managing to rack up enough damage, my brother stops on a platform. He doesn't plant anything, he doesn't do anything, he stands there with enough damage that a good aerial from Pit would kill him.   The Pit rushed towards him. The platform rose above the ground, and the guy cockily laughs as he jumps onto the platform and stands there. My brother begins to dance. Pit started up the Upperdash Arm, and just as the dance ended, my brother rolled for the first time in history, and then used the twirling stick U-Tilt to land a finishing blow on this guy.   The player looked at me, and stuck his hand out as a "good game" kind of thing. I told him it wasn't me playing, and my brother grinned ear to ear and started laughing.  This is the kind of stuff I really enjoy seeing. He's never been this excited about a match before, and suddenly he picks up on some techniques he's never used before, and uses them to win against two competitive players. I've started calling him Decky the Destroyer, and he's enjoying every moment of it.   I really do hope we can see this kind of stuff pop up in the future.    Isn't the screwdriver the same one Blendin takes in the Time Traveler's Pig? My only question is why that specific date was needed to take the screwdriver.    Well, my personal idea...  **King K. Rool**  N-Special: Bunderbuss. He pulls out his blunderbuss and fires a cannonball. Comparable to Bowser Junior's N-Special. A character can kick it in any direction assuming their move has enough knockback. He can charge this move, and if uncharged, the cannonball will drop right in front of him, and can be used as a Soccer Ball type item for K. Rool.   * N-Special 2: *Blunderbuss Gas*. K. Rool fires a burst of slow-moving poisonous gas instead of a cannonball. If an opponent gets trapped in it, it'll be a continuous attack that doesn't make opponents flinch, like Fox's laser or Palutena's Heavenly Light. Think the Ashley Assist Trophy in cloud form.   * N-Special 3: *Blunderbuss Dash*. Instead of firing a cannonball, the blast from the blunderbuss can be used to dash K. Rool forwards or backwards. Wonderful for moving across the stage.   S-Special: *Crown Toss*. K. Rool throws his crown as a boomerang attack. It acts a lot like you'd expect, except it's multi-hit and can trap opponents on the way back. He can still move around while it moving, and activate other moves, but once it touches K. Rool again, it will return to him, allowing for some insane mind games.   * S-Special 2: *Crown Shot* K. Rool can throw the crown faster and farther, but at the cost of charging it.   * S-Special 3: *Crown Volley*. A lot like the actual Boomerang item, K.   Rool can hit the B Button again to launch the crown back.   Up Special: *Helicopter Pack*. K. Rool pulls out his helicopter pack from DKC3 and uses it to fly upwards. The blades are a hitbox, but K. Rool is vulnerable everywhere else. Once the move is over, it'll disappear and he'll go into freefall.   * U-Special 2: *Electric Pack*. It has an electric effect and can damage opponents on the way up, but it has a shorter range.   *U-Special 3: *Explosive Pack*. It will explode with high knockback at the climax of the attack. K. Rool will take 5% damage if it happens, but he'll receive no knockback.   D-Special: *Kremling Krush*. A lot like Bowser Bomb, except it creates a rather large shockwave that traps opponents. References his DK64 fight.   * D-Special 2: Kremling Jump*. He'll jump upwards with great force and a gust effect, but the move can be cancelled into an aerial.    This is no different than the random appearance of platforms in Fountain of Dreams in Melee, or Yoshi's Island in Brawl. If it is indeed Final Destination-shaped, it should be legal. Assuming that the Dog's the only random platform and there are no actual hazards.    Duck Hunt: Some wild dog running in the wild, hunting, when he's ambushed by villains. Somebody saves him, and he's now following them around to help them.   Wii Fit Trainer: She's jogging and the road is blocked by some baddies. She whoops them and meets up with Wario, who's captured somebody. Being Wario, she wants to fix his problem, and assists whoever's chasing him.  Little Mac: Training with Doc and sees Donkey Kong. Challenges him. Helps him when they finish and someone wins.    I stick with the classic Blue Bomber, of course.   However, I also dabble with my Tux Dr. Mario.       All the references to the Sorcerer's Apprentice made me freak out, especially the broom and turning the apprentice into a mouse. As a huge fun of the Mickey shorts and films, this was amazing.   Henry as the new Sorcerer's Apprentice makes sense. He's the one that reunites all of these fairy tales, and will obviously be playing with some magic. He's our human Mickey, and I honestly couldn't be happier.    I'm male and I love this show. t's worth watching at least once.    Touche.   	15
 Well if they already like you right off the bat then that's all good, text away all you like. :) I can't speak for all girls, but I seldom ever like a guy right from the start to feel comfortable enough texting them at length before we've gone on a couple of dates and have gotten to know each other better.    Also, I find that certain nuances in speech get lost in text messages so if you don't know each other well enough yet, some of the stuff you're trying to say won't come across to her the way you meant it, and vice versa.  	1

Maybe I'm thinking about it wrong, or what not, anyways, sorry if my post didn't make any sense last night. That is my bad! :P   I hope! And awesome, that's good to know just in case! Thanks man!   Luckily you didn't get prescribed anything (I think), haha, but to me it shouldn't matter if I can take the meds after, cause one thing that makes me feel better is exercise and you have to stay fit to be a Marine so maybe I'll get a lot better if I get in. Thanks man.   I don't know, ever since I was in elementary school I thought that being in the armed services was the coolest thing ever. And there are times where I try and pick a different career path, but I just go back to thinking about being a Marine. I want to learn skills about how I should go about being a leader, and the bonds you make with the men next to you.    Yeah, I had no idea it was a big deal until he said that I can't join and that no one will take me for a year. I had to go online and read about it today, which was a surprise. I feel like I can ween off my mood stabilizers/anti-depressants, and I'm scheduling an appointment to see if I can. I was getting ready to hit the gym to so I can pass the physical tests too. Well, Now I have a year to get in better shape (not saying I'm in bad shape, I just don't think I can pass the test) Its one year, school gets out in 6 months, summer is 2 months, so really all I'm missing out on is 4 months. Sure I won't get to go with my friends, but I'll get to go someday.   Thank you for serving.  I will look at the videos you have provided. I have at least another year before they will take me, so maybe I'll think about it harder. People have told me to join as an officer and such.    So, I learned today by a recruiter that any branch of the armed service will not take you if you're on depression medication, and will only take you if you've been off for a year with doctors consent. So that put a little damper on my parade, I've wanted to join since I was little and I learn I cannot. Sorry, I just wanted to express and inform people who might want to join some day.  Darn, I was excited too..   Looks clean, nice fogged lights man!   I'd love a Metro key if you still have one, never played it but it looks really interesting.  Thanks man, your generosity amazes me.   Eh, personally don't like it.   Nothing. So I guess, calm. Then afterwards regret cause now I'm treated differently.   Couldn't see, not good at side angles. Haha, My apologies mate, thanks!   SVT Cobra, or Shelby? :o   I like the blackout. A lot.   I'm 17 and I want a Cobra.  Jesus, if this happened to me, I'd be so devastated.   Fuck. So I'm not alone.  Edit: Yeah I noticed I've gone down a bit and getting up isn't easy..   Exactly.   Its actually lighter than 2014. And It does look like it should be on a Taurus.   Kinda sad about the style. It just blends in with Fusions and Taurus's IMHO.   I'm smiling. Wow. Thats just the cutest thing. :D   whoa.   Still in love with your car.   I'm on mood stabilizers, so there is that option.   I'm glad you're at least feeling something different. :)   you really had to look through all of his comments.. wow.   wat   Yeah I'm now just any RDM = 1 hr, come back and do it again 1 day, then after that its perma. I don't have time for 14 yr old kids trying to be Seananners.   I used to be relax but more and more I'm becoming stricter. It's becoming a real pain with the RDM.   I.. What?   Feelin' good with the bit coins I see. Hopefully he uses them :D   wat   Yeah, for real, thats a sick addition to the car.   Its something you wouldn't ever expect to see, at least for me it is.   The blue trimmed wheels look nice.   Ahhhh jealous.   Awesome!!   I was being completely serious, thanks for the help!   But the question is, do condoms fuck anything up.   Believe me, I'm looking for power but sleek and sexiness, I might as well go for the Cobra unless I can find a reasonable Mach 1 with some extra HP from stock.   I'm very, very jealous. I'm torn between wanting a race/performance/torch/whatever-you-want-to-call-it red Cobra or Mach 1.  Love how clean your car looks. How much did you get it for/do you have any numbers?  *edit: word   Mach 1, but either is actually good.   I cringed.   Ouch, our feelings...   I was open to close friends, and then got sent away 3 times and now people think I'm just acting like it but not really depressed. Oh well.   Adorable :p   No.   I'm alliance, but I would never disrespect the horde, especially one who died.    Is that a mustang model car I see....    Some people these days... Jeez, I'm sorry you have to deal with people like that.   Yes, simply put.   Oh thanks so much :D Sorry if it was a problem!   Oh my god, if you're still up for it can you do me? If not, that's completely cool!   [This is me](https://scontent-b.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ash4/1375909_634419609936813_1235110306_n.jpg)   It was a sad day for us Huskies..      why put a cobra anything on something thats not a cobra..?   Shhhh, don't comment if you didn't read the article.   I don't like the front end, but to each their own.   Huh, Maybe I'll chose to get a Term instead of a Mach then.. Thanks mate!   Nice, out of all of them which do you enjoy driving more?   I'm so jealous. I might hate you, but love you. Sweet Mach and Term mate. How much was all that?   I love it.   What Oni said.   Unless you hate the color, do it.   If you can, that'd be awesome. :) Thanks!   Oh dude/dudet, that's so awesome! Thank you very much :D   If its not too late, can you draw me :)?  https://scontent-b.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-frc1/1176186_623513821027392_1260561400_n.jpg   such a smooth gif...   I liked my IOP (was for teens), but I wasn't in there long, so I too would like to hear what people have to say and their experiences.   Its 7pm, why would we be sleeping.   No I got what you were saying. Sorry if it came off rude.   I could easily get 100 on BF3, no problems, I understand its the first day, but its so jumpy.   Anyone else getting low jumpy FPS?  My rig is: i5 2500k @ 3.30 GHz 8GB Ram GTX 670 2gb  and I have the 331.40 Beta drivers installed.  I don't understand, I can't even run this on Low.   (Sorry if this doesn't belong here)    that was.. beautiful..   So clean, looks awesome!   Can't wait to see what she/he looks like when it's all cleaned up!   Ugh, Mach 1 3   That is amazing. Very jealous.   The noises I made watching this weren't human. Certainly WTF.   Well, R.I.P   Anytime!   Not every car has to be a "female" :P, good for you for being a nonconformist! He looks good. Congratulations! :D   It's okay, it's just a cupcake in your eye.   I just saw a dude fuck a baked chicken and cum into it.  Why does that even exist?   It has to be in my town, well then.   Ah that would explain it D:, hopefully one day you could give a few hundred more miles on it. It's a beauty!    Can someone explain why get a fast car but never drive it, not being rude, just curious why pay 60k for a car you never really drive. Thanks! (BTW, looks nice ;) )   PC. You?    Lucky, my family doesn't like to game with me.. :(   Awesome!   Lovely simple pony.   Beautiful.   Oh, so lucky. I wish I could find one around here for that. The only Mach 1 is a Zinc Yellow for 15k. Anyways, very cool car, wish I could have one.   How much was it?   I am completely jealous of your Mach 1, it looks beautiful.   Can I be a fairy too?   Ouch, my feelings.   Yeah bro, cause a 5.0 isn't much.      "Daddy loved you"  Chills and feels.  Glad you're alive, even if its just for now.  	109
 Exposure therapy.   Cheaper oil  Some places suck the oil out of the fill hole instead of draining it out of the drain hole of the pan.  Which means any metal shavings in the vehicle will either be left in the oil pan or pulled up through the motor and not drained.     You gasp, snort, snore, or whatever other noise once your airway becomes obstructed and you wake up enough to open it back up.  Deviated septum is going to give you less options on masks to treat your apnea, since most of the nose ones probably won't give you enough air passage to be comfortable.  Tonsils removed may make a difference, they have surgeries where they basically scar your throat to make it less likely to droop and obstruct your airway.  I dont know what the surgery is called off the top of my head.  So tonsil removal MIGHT have some aspect of that surgery included in it, you might even ask if they could do both.  Friend of mine had his tonsils out, it didn't do away with his apnea and need for the machine.  Another had his deviated septum fixed and it cured up a lot his allergy problems, but he didn't have apnea to begin with.    Apnea is typically an obstruction in your throat once you fall asleep your skin basically droops and forms like a little suction/vacuum there that your brain interprets as suffocating and wakes you up which causes the muscles and tissue to firm back up and you gasp/snore/clear your throat/whatever weird animal grunting noise you make.    Oh and all masks have "weaknesses" besides fit.  Some the cushions wear out super fast.  With the entire face mask, the headstraps lose their ability to hold on the "loop" side of the velcro and it's a mask you gotta put on kinda tight to make it flex to fit your face on some people.    I will say that from my support groups, most people dont tolerate nasal pillows beyond like a 12-15 pressure.  It's too much air being forced into your nose and nasal passages and really dries you out.  Very few people beyond a 15 can use them, very very very few.  Even the people who sell them dont suggest them at high pressures.    If you're at that high of pressure, I might even question some of the around the nose masks.  My brother has low pressure, but he uses what I'd call an entire face mask.  It basically covers from above your eyebrows down to just above your chin.  It allows your body heat to help keep the air warm due to all the surface area on your face and doesn't feel like you've got cold air behind forced up your nose...and helps with eye irritation since if it leaks you're not having it blow into your eyes like on nearly every other mask.  I can't recall the name of it right now, but I think respironics or resmed makes it.  It has the inlet tube on the side for central sleep apnea machines.  Im not sure if the bipap needs to use that tube or not.    I personally use around the nose masks....I've tried the entire face mask a few times, but could never get comfortable with it sleeping on my side.  If you're a back sleeper it should be pretty awesome.      I see now.  But since Im here and something else I remembered came up.  Having untreated sleep apnea can cause high blood pressure and over time can cause circulatory system issues.  You're basically suffocating, your brain responds by going into fight or flight and wakes up you, gives you little BP spikes all night and little spurts of adrenaline potentially.  So your veins eventually begin to harden prematurely because it's like you spend all your nights in near constant "fight or flight" and you're body is not meant for that.  That is how it was explained to me in a cpap support group.   That might be what your doctor is getting at, I'd just ask him to explain what's up.  Some of the CPAP clinics are not very good about supporting their patients, they just shove hardware in your hand and often times dont even teach you how to adjust it properly for good fit.    You're 37 now, tried it at 18.  So that's nearly 20 years.  The machines improve alot in just 5 years...so you probably had something more akin to a vacuum cleaner than a current day cpap back then.   That's how they made the first cpap machines, reversed vacuum cleaner motors.  Heated tube helps prevent rain out, where drops form in the mask and tube and then drip on your face or collect in the tube and gurgle causing pressure loss.  Or you can get tube wraps that help insulate it as a cheaper solution.  Dry mouth is opening mouth, or humidity.......I USUALLY set my humidity about 3 and do fine until it's freezing cold in the winter then I need to crank it up to 5 and then run out of water during the night.  So if you are running out of water the humidifier won't do a whole lot....if your tank is empty in the morning it could explain dry mouth and there isn't a lot you can do about it if you are filling your tank to the fill line.    I would have never guessed how to pronounce "Sloughing", saw it in books, etc..  But never registered the way it sounds when someone says it with the actual word for quite awhile.  Which it's pronounced something like "Sluffing".   And seeing on diet websites, the word "Satiety", I expect more letters for how it sounds or something.    Nope, I feel like nice clothes never fit me comfortably and I feel out of place wearing them.  But Im fat so......that's part of it.   I can relate, Im 36 years old.  Although I will add one big factor of it is feeling alone/lonely.  People really don't want to hear about your shit, or you perceive they don't want to hear about your shit.  If the off chance you do find someone to kind of unload on, and it feels better, they will start feeling the same way too and then either have to get away from you or end up like you.  Then you drop to an even lower level of "why the fuck bother"ness.  Told my parents about my feelings less than a handful of times and I could tell they didn't get it or thought even less of me for it.  So I don't do that anymore.  I really can't say that I believe my therapist understands that deep self loathing, apathy, and loneliness that comes along with everything else.    My best description of mine would be that the universe/fate/god/whatever will make anything I attempt to do fail or turn out worse for me.  As has historically been the case.  So why would I want to tempt that "force" and try to be "better" when I know Im just going to end up worse off.  I'm really tempted to put a "deadline" on my life, get fixed or get dead by age X.  I told myself for years and years I would die/kill myself by 35.  Here I am 36 and any little bit of happiness I have ends up leaving or being taken away.   The whole "behaviorism" aspect of psychology is ....... really the wrong way to approach people who have similar thinking to me.  Because I am an convinced that my behavior is in defense of my life being even worse and that's the only thing that can come of trying.  And behaviorism tries to teach you that your behavior is not working, so you should change type...basically.  It's just complete opposite IMO, you're basically trying to convince an atheist to become religious or vice versa with words.    Welp I'd be interested in talkin if ya want.   Yeah I used to read, but started doing more audiobooks since I find I can do some mundane tasks with the book going.  So I always wonder how you really review an audiobook to be useful for improvement....I can see a few parts.  - Same reader throughout a series, doesn't matter if they aren't the most popular.  Switching them up is just annoying unless you've found some kind of magical replacement that improves on everything and still keeps the pronunciations and things the same.  - Pronunciations, bugs me sometimes.  - A lot of characters with names that start with the same sounds.  Stephen, Stephanie...lots of S names and it starts to become really hard to track whose talking unless the guy reading does some killer voice work.  Can probably think of more, but just kind of giving some idea of there being aspects JUST for the audiobook and then things that make the story muddy that can be brought into the audiobook that the text might not give the reader....S names, weird pronunciations of what you THOUGHT it sounded like.  James Marsden on the Dresden Files audiobooks does some awesome work, I think he enhances the story so much more with how he does the reading.  Then one book they didnt use him and I couldn't listen to it, had to read it so I could at least try to hear his voices in my head while I read.  Im really not even sure how much power the author has over audiobook decisions in general.    And I must confess I am not familiar with your writing by just character names being mentioned.    Not disagreeing with you, but I think authors should strive to keep some consistency and it should be recognized as something they should be doing.  It kind of falls under "I writer's responsibility is to only release a book that they feel is worth a readers time and money."  bullet point but when it comes to series I expect them to have some consistency/continuity to them.   There's sort of an implied contract that a fantasy series is going to stay a fantasy series, and not become some weird erotica story based vaguely on your popular series to cash in or fill a quota your publisher set.  Eventually the word and practice will catch up to the author and make it hard to get people to buy their books, but if we're talking morality here, bait and switch/whatever is basically cheating you out of your money based on a good faith history.  Since if you could read the whole book and know what was in it, you wouldn't need to buy it.    If it becomes a "thing authors do in this industry", you are starting a spiral downward on whose to blame for why people need to wait to buy books like it is with video games now for many people.  Hopefully Im coming across here.  Kinda tired.    Im not advocating piracy or anything by saying this, but I think there should be a caveat or......like a third bullet point to cover the instances where authors writing a series go waaaay off the path in the story line.    Im not going to name anyone specific or a series because I dont want to start that argument, but there is one specific series I have in mind where the series became more about the main character having sex than it did about story.  And that was.....half a dozen or more books into the series.  Now that may be covered under bullet 2, but I think it needs to be pointed out.  That a series should still fit within some semblance of the previous books or it's a fairly big slap in the face to the reader IMO.    Delays and things potentially can't be helped, but I just can't forget that WTF moment in that series when I was trying to figure out what percentage of the book was sex scenes and how many pages that left of actual story.    And, I think the length drove off anyone who might even attempt to help.  Heh.  Well thanks whoever else upped it.    Your sister is awesome.   You are spectacular.  Glad you posted again just so I could see the history.......whew.   Kind of depends on the activity for me.  If it's something social, I spend a lot of time analyzing what people say and wondering if it's really as negative as it seemed or meant to be negative or.... or...  and what people think of me and if I should even be there because none of them really like me.   If it's like watching movie at a friends house, usually not to bad unless it's a particularly bad depression day for me...then I wonder if they are just being nice and really want me to leave.   But I haven't hung out with friends in ......a long time now.  A year or more, so I dont even know if they'd still be considered friends.    Pretty sure a plane is considered to be under the laws of the nation it leaves until it's touched down someplace else.  Something along those lines....  since they have to have something in place for transporting prisoners..air marshals etc.    Is the mask coming off, like not fitted well and slipping above your head?  Or are you waking up and taking it off and not remembering?  Like it's someplace unlikely to be if it had just slipped off.  I know that benadryl gives me anxious dreams and makes it hard to sleep.  You take a lot of allergy meds and they might have some affect similar to that of benadryl on me.   I found that with my mask, just clearing my nose with a neti pot or a nose spray or something will allow me to be fine with my allergies until morning due to the filtration and humidity.   It COULD simply just be that the mask you have isn't right for you.  Isn't big enough, too big, or just isn't comfortable enough.  There's a number of full face masks, and there's even one that looks like a fire fighter mask and goes above your eyes and around to just below your bottom teeth.  My brother uses one of the fire fighter masks just because he couldn't find a mask he liked that was smaller.   You have a nice body.  Im a tits guy myself, so, enjoying those.    Hotness.   I spend unhealthy amounts of time on here looking at girls......you have absolute nothing to be ashamed about.    	23
 I'm 21, and I've rather recently discovered that I have early onset arthritis in my right knee. So I definitely know your struggle. It's not easy. I usually just use either a compression brace, or a full on DonJoy knee brace, depending on the pain level. However, there are many days I can go without one. But on bad days, I can't really seem to cope with it. I get really irritable, and my closest friends and family can't really seem to be near me. The only one who has been able to stay by me is the wonderful woman I'm dating. She always seems to know what to say or do. My biggest recommendation is to find a good brace, and an even better support system. Because otherwise, at least in my opinion, the pain may just over take you.   Also, lots of ibuprofen. Always a big help when it comes to inflammation, or any sort of pain. Hope this helped you!! You are not alone!!    ......Can someone please tell me what video this is? I've actually never heard of it.....   That's not pathetic at all. It's never easy to lose someone you're close with, and when something like this happens, it's completely natural to want to make amends. Don't think that it's pathetic that you want to talk to your grandfather again, and tell him how you feel.   As far as the Miranda Rights being read is concerned, they only need to read them to you before booking you. So they have from the time they arrest you to the time they book you to read them to you. Otherwise, anything that you have said before that won't count against you.   After you've been read them, then the only thing you should say is "I want to speak to a lawyer."    First off, congratulations on being clean!! My father ended up kicking meth, so it's always amazing for me to hear of others that are also doing well!! I love hearing about how others can kick those kinds of habits to better themselves!!   Second, it sounds like your parents don't really deserve your time. (Now that is just my opinion, but I've also had to cut toxic people from my life, so I know the struggle.) It sucks to write/hear, but sometimes that's what's necessary to building a happy and healthy life.  I'm honestly curious, you said the help of NA, and I know that one. Who is the "Bill W" mentioned in this post?   This. This is the reason Ron would never join Voldy. He's way more afraid Mrs. Weasley than of the Dark Lord.    That makes total sense. Her character feels to forced. And (at least, this is how it feels to me) she is always going on about how she's a lesbian. It almost feels as though the writers just want people to know that, rather than focus on making her a hunter. That's just my two cents though.   I never really thought of Charlie in that sense. In fact, I never really think of any of the characters in that sense unless it's a situation like when Sam or Dean has a female guest over. Other than that, to me, they are all just people who hunt the things that go bump in the night. So I guess I'm saying that I personally have never had a problem with Charlie, however, I can definitely see where you would have a problem with her. And kudos to you for pointing this out :)   Everyone keeps saying Tony. For some reason, I just can't see it being him. I can, of course, see it being Fury. I, too, feel it needs to be him.    That's the best thing about this fandom. Everyone helps everyone else.   	10
       This happens to me at Target.    Literally   I am embarrassed at how many of these "facts" i am learning are false for the first time because of this thread.         	7
 What do you mean what about them?      I've heard caffeine helps. But I had the same question.  	3
 Helps a lot actually, especially with your username. Live long   Thanks for the reply! I started feeling like I do around 7 or 8 so I totally get you.    I had friends who had to ask me if it was ok to laugh when i told them. When all that's left is absurdity, enjoy it.   You're doctor is the only one who can tell you that. Just remember that there is no magic bullet with mental health. You're going to have good days and bad. Hopefully, by working through the process, the good will eventually outweigh the bad.    I really connected with that, a lot of similarities with me as well.    It helps a bit yes. I have lonliness and abandonment issues so talking to people helps.    Good on you fundamentally misunderstanding a disease    Nope, bipolar means you have up periods. I don't   This has brightened my day but no my very serious medical condition has not disappeared.    The brain is a crazy thing, so it is actually possible. Not saying it's gospel, some therapy isn't as good as others, you just gotta find what's right for you.    Ahh, gotcha. My bad.    A double horseshoe?   And to you. Remember, these are just my experiences, so don't necessarily self diagnose. If you think there's an issue that needs help, I strongly recommend seeing a counselor of some sort.    Same here, feel free to pm any time. Thanks!   Appreciate that, though being honest I didn't realize it, and when I did, I did do a Karma whore post.    Could very well be a major factor. I haven't ever eaten healthy, even when I dropped weight.    I can't diagnose you. If you think you might, see a professional for diagnosis/treatment. It's not anything to wait around on.    I have two hands.    It's what I've been used to for about 13 years now, don't know much else on the emotional spectrum.    If you ever feel like you might have any kind of mental disorder; constant sadness, extreme apathy, hearing voices, loss of time, seek a professional counselor for diagnosis.    Feel better now?   http://500motivators.com/plog-content/thumbs/motivate/me/large/44-oh-i-see-what-you-did-there.jpg   I have a friend who's done that and it seemed to help him. I need to research more but I'm not at all opposed.    I know, it's something I'm trying to do but it's damn hard at times.    It's not overly common and is an explanation as to why standard treatments weren't helping.    Some days are easier than others but when it comes down to it, I got out of bed today because of what might come tomorrow.    You are most welcome. Most of my collegiate career has been such bullshit I delight in making sure others arent going through the same.    Many thanks. Seem to be a stream of people who didn't like this post looking to kill it. But jokes on them, I made the front page, I can live without the karma.    I work the graveyard at a call center which is DEAD on weekends so it's been helping me stay awake actually, but I'm happy if it helped at all.    Considering I paid a whopping total of 16 dollars to my psychiatrist, probably not.    Much appreciated.   Medication can be a bitch and a half, kudos to you for stubborning your way past when it stopped being effective.   Relationships take a lot of time and patience, even more so when you have depression, but you'll get there.    Listen to Patton Oswalt and eat a tube of circus peanuts knowingly. I must prepare.    It will. It can always get better. God I hate saying something this cliche, but it always gets darkest before dawn, (I know, I hate me too) but the fact that you can see yourself happy is a good thing. If you can see it, it's possible. For a long time I couldn't even see myself happy.    Not exactly what it is, but this is a true statement.    Yeah, it's mostly about getting better for me. Honestly just the name made me laugh when I heard it and has been an interesting conversation piece, which is why I did this.    It seems to be fairly new from the other comments.    Sounds pretty similar, except I don't have the up days, I'm always on the lower side of things.    I'm trying to get into meditation, but my mind races a bit to fast and i havent figured out how to calm it just yet.   I've never taken any illegal substances, and that's all I will say about that.    Is that a Breaking Bad reference I'm not getting?   One of my close friends was diagnosed bi polar, so we have that connection that has really helped us both through some tough times.    No worries, at my worst I wouldn't wish what I was going through on anyone. Reddit actually helped me a lot in showing me that I'm not alone. If you ever need an ear, we're always around.    Very nice. I have to loose weight and exercise releases positive endorphins that can really help with depression so I'm trying to get into the habit, it's just breaking through the apathy. Thanks for the well wishes!   You as well. I find it kind of fascinating how little we really know about depression and the human brain, like which meds work with who and why.  	43
 I feel you - that was tough to get through...still think the ending makes all of that worth it though. And to be honest, I felt like Shun's suicide was sadder than Maria and Mamoru leaving...   I find this hard to accept - I've never failed a test in my life.   I had enough time to study on the train commute thank goodness! I'm probably the worst procrastinator I know. :/   I can't decide if this sounds like a good idea or a bad idea.   	4
 Im so excited for this! Placeholder!   Its actually a mix between two colors: Revlon colorstay matte balm in the colors Audacious and Showy. I put Audacious on over Showy to make a pinky-coral. And I got it dyed professionally the first time, but I used L'oreal Hi-Color Hilights in Red, which is the same color as the salon color, and I continue to use that on my roots. But when I touch up the middle and ends of my hair I use Beyond the Color Zone in Wild Red! Hope that helps!   Thank you!      Good, I'm glad I could be some help!    Thanks, I have been trying to figure out the best way to make the most of my lashes for years so I really appreciate that! :)   I kind of do a combination of both? Haha. If you're going to do the wiggle, do it right at the root of your lashes and then swipe the rest of the way up. I find that way works best for me. And if you want added length, what I do is close my eye and put some mascara just at the tips so it really builds at the ends instead of building thicker in the middle. Hope that helps!      Aw, thank you!   Haha, thanks, I appreciate that! I'm always worried about looking like I'm wearing too many colors.   Wow, this is absolutely gorgeous! I love that lip color on you. I would say that if you want your features to stand out more in pictures, you might wanna turn up the drama on your eyes so that your beautiful features don't get lost in the distance! Perhaps that's not the look you want to go for, but that's what I would recommend. :)   Thank you!

They urged me to do an Ariel inspired look, since my hair is bright red, and I've absolutely loved the movie since I was a child. I hope that everything goes okay at the hospital! Enjoy!  http://imgur.com/a/ccX3J#0  Edit: Totally sorry for the potato quality. I dont have a real camera lol.   Is your puppy a Yorkie-Poo? He looks exactly like my dog at my parents' house. I miss him so much now that I saw your dog.    Man, you really need to work on your tact and your people skills in general....   Wow, you remind me so much of Lorde.   Thanks so much! will definitely be getting this one after reading about it.            I just came here to say that you made a beautiful choice! The hair cut and color makes you look like a different person entirely. I love it! It's so cute!   Holy shit. I wouldn't even spend that much money on MYSELF.       I think your eyebrows are gorgeous. Your eyes and lip color are also very pretty, but I think that if youre going to have super sparkly bold eyes like that, you need to balance them out with a more nude lip color, and if youre going to go with the bold lip color, a more neutral eye look would do best. Right now the colors are kind of taking over your face rather than enhancing it. My rule is that I pick one thing about my face I want to show off that day and enhance it,    The fucking kitchen scissors. I dont even need them all that often but i see them every day UNTIL I need to use them.  	29
 Yes I do second-guess my depression a lot. It doesn't help that some people tell me that I'm not depressed, just lazy.    I'm not sure if it changes where you are from but as long as you have a medical note from your doctor and you have been experiencing problems with it then you should 'qualify'. They can't reject you because people need to realise this is a real condition and it has real affects to daily life. Whether you are in uni or have a job or both - depression can make it a lot harder to keep up and get by.   Because I feel like I might be milking it a bit and they might think that I'm just attention seeking or something. But I'll take what I can get   I secretly do so I'll wait til they bring it up and then start my guns.  	4

 Yay thanks :)  http://i.imgur.com/mUAvrAQ.jpg  I think they are cuties    http://www.ebay.com/itm/Funko-Pop-Disney-Frozen-ELSA-glitter-variant-vinyl-figure-82-/331450588507?pt=LH_DefaultDomain_0 hash=item4d2bfe9d5b  This guy has it at 600   I will feel bad for opening mine if so. O.O   :D Congratulations!   And great! I've had mine since it was ING.   Could be an unauthorized port or something completely ridiculous like a crappy game with a new sticker. *shrugs*   Many people also decorate their magic bands themselves. I plan on making a Frozen one! :D   *heavy breathing*   Your buddy is an alcoholic. The very best thing you can do for him is to get him the help he needs (which he probably won't want). Do it for his kid.   Wilhelm scream, anyone?   Rebels has enough in it for us "big" kids. Give it a shot.   I hear good things about Star Wars weekends at Disney.   https://www.etsy.com/listing/201508769/blaster-replica?ref=sr_gallery_22 ga_search_query=leia+blaster ga_search_type=all ga_view_type=gallery  Found a 3-D printed one on Etsy. Definitely unlicensed, but only 100.   I think it has more to do with certain State fans thinking their football program was better because it jumped to FBS after one season. We never played each other until 2014 and apparently that made us Eagles look like we were 'scared.'  This was then further exacerbated by clueless announcers calling Georgia Southern Georgia State on multiple occasions. [Friendly PSA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=putYM15zC0Y)   Disney has shown the Boba Fett portion of the Holiday Special at special character dining events at WDW. Stranger things have happened.   Sorry bud.   HAIL SOUTHERN   KICK TO WIN   Yeah, kickers are not usually sought after recruits with a tight scholarship budget. Fritz knew what we needed though.   I dont know if there will be a ramp-up to buying for Star Wars,' Iger said, with most merchandise tied to a film typically selling around its release.  LOL that's not how Star Wars works Bob. If you sell it, they will buy.   I'm excited. We have had a few seasons now where the kicking has not been stellar. I'm talking about regular missed PAT.   Hail Southern! We can kick football now! :D      Good to know, thanks.   I am going to try at Midnight EST, fwiw.   I already have an alarm set to remind me to try for lunch reservations for my trip. *fingers crossed*   The boat rides were my favorite part. Also the cute cute architecture! I also enjoyed how the bus stop was nice and shady. The Gurgling Suitcase bar was also very fun!   Adorable!   They look like tsum tsums! :D   Mine's 500, just like the student card I screwed everything up with. It's my second card ever, so that probably has something to do with it.   Capital One has some cards for rebuilding. My SO is helping me rebuild for the same reason. I got one (with a tiny limit) immediately approved from Capital One so now I can start on the right path. Good luck!  I also bank with Capital One 360, so this may have helped me out. YMMV   Well there goes that career plan, guess I'll just continue to focus on my PhD then. :o   I always thought it was Luke.  EU post movies Luke. Well, I guess we will see in VII :D   Oh I am so sad for you hun :(   Most good tea shops will have some form or another of a house brand Moroccan Mint.    So if FDOT needs to hire archaeologists to check the area before they begin the project I will work for on-site room and board and weekend park tickets hehe.   Do you think I am defending her or something? I am confused as to why you are taking this so personally.   Thank you for dramatically correcting my opinion of a person neither of us know anything significant about beyond OP's post. I really appreciate your guidance.   No, but that's where it began. She found out something she didn't like about her boyfriend and let it fester until she did something drastic instead of talking to him about it and letting him know how she felt and also trying to see his side of things. I agree that it is a selfish way to be.   Coming from a chick here- She's overreacting and does not know how to communicate about what bothers her on an adult level.  Sure it hurts you now and don't let anyone tell you it shouldn't because that's an important part of the healing process. But you will be much happier being with someone who respects you more than that.   Good advice. I definitely think the breakfast will be one of the highlights of our trip. Getting the TS Fastpass sounds like the safe option! Thank you!   I'm sorry to hear that! I think I have been convinced to get the TS FP!   Thank you! Y'all have convinced me!   I really appreciate your in-depth reply. I would be more upset missing TS than RnRC, not sure how my SO feels though. It sounds like I should stick with Toy Story! :) Thanks!   Hello friends. I am trying to determine if I am making a HUGE mistake. I think I have decided to risk NOT FP+ing Toy Story Midway Mania. I know, I know! Let me explain.  We have an 8:25 AM Galactic Dine In Star Wars Breakfast Reservation at the Sci Fi Dine In Restaurant for May 6. The park opens at 9. Since I can either FP+ Toy Story or the Rockin Roller Coaster, I think I am going to chance it and take the Roller Coaster since we are so close to Toy Story in the park. I don't want to rush through the breakfast either though so I guess my question is, how soon after 9 AM does the line become unbearable for Toy Story? I have done it before, and it was WONDERFUL and my SO has never done it (and I know he would love it).   What do you think? Thanks in advance and may the force be with you!   You can team up with a partner on Star Wars: The Old Republic. My boyfriend and I are paired up and playing through the Knight/Consular story lines together. It's awesome and you get two story lines at the same time. We also have a Bounty Hunter/Imperial Spy game going.   If your party likes movies/Star Wars/Pixar/Muppets then HS. Epcot for international flair! Shopping, food, and awesome fireworks.    Thanks!   Crossing my fingers for May...   Etsy is great too. I just got a set of Chewbacca ears there. Find a seller who makes ones you like, then ask if they will do a custom order.   The only special thing is that HS has tiers for their fast passes, so you can only make reservations for one A ride and 2 B rides.   Toy Story Mania and Rockin Roller Coaster are both A.    Sorry to hijack but do you know when Pirates will be down? Thanks. :(   That's pretty much how Teavana makes their money.    The first time I saw it it started just as we were getting to MK from Epcot after watching Illuminations and we saw part from the Monorail and that was awesome! We watched the rest from the plaza near the ticket center.   Or crepes...  	55
 I'm graduating and leaving town, or I'd say I'd go. Are you working or taking classes over the summer? If so, you could ask coworkers or classmates to go. Make a few new friends :)   Shaving legs in the sink is doable, just not ideal. I'll try switching the water tomorrow when I shave to see if that helps.   I have not used pre shave oil.    I'm not use to having to pull my skin so it is stretched, so I'm probably not doing it 100% the way it should be.  Update: using the lower faucet helped with the lather. Ended up knicking my underarm - trying to hold the razor, pull the skin, and shave with basically one hand is harder than anticipated.     None!?   Buy a tube or raft to go tubing down the river. Best free (aside from initial investment of tube and any alcohol you bring) thing to do on a hot summer day.   This isn't on campus, but it is a fun thing to do during the summer in Mt. Pleasant.    I just started using DE razor and I use it in the shower, takes a bit longer but I think that's just because I'm still learning.    With the lather I think I just used too much water. I shave in the shower and it was easy to dilute the soap too much.   Yes they were problem areas I had before. Issues with razor burn and irritation.   Oh and I attempted to shave my underarms and I'm having trouble getting as close of a shave there, legs are much easier.    My list of things to try is expanding quickly, but I'll definitely add that to my list :)    I picked up some of that soap and I noticed a huge difference. :)    I bought some new soap and it definitely made a difference. I don't quite have the lather down. There are a couple areas that I'm having trouble getting a close shave with though. I still haven't cut myself yet, but I'm terrified of the day I do.    Try looking on Amazon. Also they are better if you leave them out and they get a little stale.   Edit: After a quick search on my phone, it looks like peeps don't ship outside the US. Not sure on shipping regulations from the US to Australia, but you might be able to have someone personally ship you some.   I've lurked here awhile and did research on other threads and found Astra mentioned quite a bit my newcomers, so it seemed like the safe and logical choice to begin. Can I get Taylor of Old Bond Street cream in a store, or is it online only? Thank you! I stumbled across you guys a few months ago, and instantly became interested. I already can't wait for my leg hair to grow back so I can give it another go. :)   No worries, I'm posting in a man dominated subreddit. And this is the first time I've posted something and outted myself as female. So I would have assumed I was male as well.   Thanks for the thought out reply! I'm nervous to try feathers because I've heard they are good, but also easy to cut yourself with. So far I like Astras, but I'm excited to see what else is out there and what works best for me. :)    Thanks! I tried to pay as much attention to what I was doing and what did or didn't seem to work. I had noise to a minimal so I could listen to how it sounded as I shaved. If I get razor burn in an area, how should I treat it differently the next time?   Edit: I actually don't have any hair on my face. I used the razor to shave my legs last night and this morning I used it on my underarms.    Thank you! I am in the US, I'll be sure to stop by Walgreens and pick some up to try. :)    First shave was pretty successful! Didn't get quite as close of a shave as I was hoping for, but didn't cut myself either. I'm sure with practice I'll get better. :)    Do you have a favorite? I purchased the razor, blades, and brush one at a time as I had the money, but I was impatient and just bought the soap I could find at Walmart.    I hadn't used it before and didn't realize until after I tried lathering that it wouldn't work. :(       As someone who digs through applications and hires new employees, if I had to do this it would take up my entire day. I get so many applications where I work, I can't even look at every single one. If you care enough about getting the job, give the company a call to check on your application, but don't be a pest about it.    I love your tagging system. I always buy books faster than I can read them, and then some get lost in the shuffle until months later I realize I still haven't read them. I may have to steal this idea. :)    There are several women over at /r/wicked_edge that have found a better way to shave.    Thanks! I'll try those. :)    I apologize for the misunderstanding. :)    I've been wanting to pick up drinking scotch. Do you have any recommendations on where to start?   You have too much good beer in VT to not keep trying. Here's a pointer to enjoying beer, I've found that when I pour the beer into a mug, it tastes better than in the bottle. Pour the beer just right so you get a bit of a head on top. Also, there is a wide variety of beers. If you don't like the taste of an IPA, you may enjoy a Porter more. Where I'm from, there are some stores that sell create-your-own six packs. I recommend finding one of those, and purchasing six completely different styles of beer. Try each one (not all the same night) so that you can see which ones you prefer. Keep note of what you do or don't like, and then you can ask for beers with similar tastes.   I love me a good beer. I'm currently visiting VT and there are some really good local beers I've stumbled across, but I still love me a pint of PBR on occasion. Everyone likes to bash it, but I think it's a good beer in it's own way.    That is extremely helpful. Thank you!    What's the best way to clean it? I've read a lot of people do a vinegar and water mix, is that a 1:1 ratio? Do you have any recommendations for blades?   	28

 As a genuinely curious male who doesn't know: what are the struggles of females in the dating world?   Classic Schmosby   Only 9 hours? You didn't watch the extended edition. For shame.    While any situation like this can absolutely be regarded as rape, I would like to tentatively suggest that he may not have considered it a negative experience had she been very attractive.   I doubt it.    Every suggestion in this thread is absolutely valid, but I've always found the best cure is to find someone else to think about. Not necessarily go out with etc, though that's great for you if you're ready for it, but find someone else to occupy your mind, wish you were with , want to talk to and so on.    Go for it! :)   despite the fact that I usually dress very well  I'm going to be a little skeptical, because this can be subjective. Perhaps she meant dress a little more *convemtionally* well?   Tbh, the dating system is MUCH easier for women than for men.    I literally cannot ever scratch anything in my mother's presence, because it means I must be sick or having an allergic reaction to something somehow. Apparently people don't just get itchy sometimes.    I decided something had to be done when my self esteem was so low and I was so worried what everybody thought of me that I started having severe panic attacks in public.    I'd be happier for people to be here than to have no community at all.   Seven years? I find optimism helps.   Comments like this are what give this subreddit a reputation for being breakup trigger-happy.   Gorgeous! I know it's totally up to you and your goals, but based on how much your face has changed, I reckon you're fine where you are :)   I'm glad you're recovering - things *will* get better for you. PM me if you ever need to talk.    Mate, that's amazing progress! Congratulations, you should be really proud of yourself!  I'm doing ok. Starting losing some weight - only two kilos down, but that's not so bad, as I only want to lose about fifteen. I was actually feeling on the way up for the first time in years before I got diagnosed - like I'd started the medication before getting the illness.    Thanks, you too!   I'm glad you feel better, and I hope it stays that way! I know the parents are just worried, which is why I'm trying to put up with it as much as possible. It's just awkward because if there's any reason I'm like this in the first place, it's probably them.  With regards to therapy, I'm actually being taught medical hypnosis at the moment - which sounds whacked, but you do it to yourself, and it's basically a kind of meditation where you combat low self esteem by convincing yourself that you're actually worthwhile and things like that. So far it's working.    It will get better. Trust me. No matter what happens, you will get through these exams and shit and into a brighter place. PM me if you need to talk it out any more, any time. Really.   And I hadn't intended it to be, but I love that band and I love that song! Cheers brother!   It took me a while to realize they don't want help, they want the emotional support to enable them to help themselves.    Exactly right. Even though I'm relatively new here (been lurking for a bit), I think this subbreddit would benefit from a mentality of being a team where we can beat our problems together - *more* than just a place where we can talk it out (though that's great too).   I'm glad you're out of the relationship, and I'm glad you're washing the memories away with something tasty. Though whether you feel fine in the morning is yet to be seen :P  PM me if you ever need to talk.    Cheers! Good luck to you bud :)   It's weird how you take a kind of perverse pleasure in being depressed. It's one of the reasons I took so long to get diagnosed - you feel like its one of the few things you really enjoy.   But you'll get back on your feet, and enjoying things the conventional way. Feel free to PM me any time :)   I struggled for a long time with the possibility that I might just have a severe case of Whiny Little Bitch Disorder, so to know that I'm not just an attention whore is nice.   It also took a *long* time and the constant encouraging of some very helpful friends to get me to therapy at all. I just didn't want to take a step forward (though I didn't see it like that at the time). So I guess I have achieved something.    I'm glad you're making progress! The only way is up!  Ironically, I've been diagnosed at a point when I also actually feel on the uphill at last, as opposed to the usual low point when people finally see a doctor. It's quite weird, having almost received the medication a few months before the illness.    It's absolutely not your fault. At all.   What I'd meant was that I had unwittingly been an example of how men see an emotionally strong and confident male, and the benefit that such an attitude of emotional self-reliance brings them, and instantly try to emulate it - or believe that they are inferior for not being able to do so. It's a knee-jerk reaction to someone you perceive to be 'better' than you.    Bro, you're just at one those temporary low points that happen to everyone. The only way from here is up, and I'm sure you'll be right on top of it next week.    If he wants to fix things, it means he is concerned and he cares.    Actually, I would say shoulders first (if that) and waist a very close second. Compare the attractiveness of a man in a loose dress shirt and a slim fit dress shirt of the same size - equal shoulders, but one looks like a tent.    So basically, you want clothes that fit without actually changing what clothes you wear?  And it's male *fashion.* So it's going to be clothes that are fashionable. Like not tshirts.    How else is anyone supposed to address the gender as a whole?   On that note, should we expect... that non-man gender to not use the word 'male?'   And this is precisely where the social pressure comes from. It's not your fault, but as soon as I read your comment I criticized myself for not having the moral strength and conviction that you do, and decided I should try to be more like it in the future, before realising I was perpetuating the stereotype.    What girls say they want a man to do with his emotions and what they *actually* want are two very different things.   They want a man to open up about himself an expose his vulnerabilities. But they also want him to be a towering pillar of strength and self-confidence, because that's what's attractive. Lo and behold, when I try to express the fact that I'm actually not this ridiculously self-confident and completely emotionally self-reliant thing, they are gone in a flash.    Can you imagine it without the u and g?   Australian here: people who drive supercharged V8s like they own the place are generally shunned from society.    I was actually expecting 'listen when I'm upset and don't try to fix the problem'   everyone hates having me around them  As someone who used to think the same thing, I can assure you that they don't. I have atrocious self-esteem (it's getting better, and I'll tell you why), and frequently would go out with my friends and return home feeling like shit because of all the stupid things I've said or done. Focus in every tiny little thing that indicates that someone hated me, even though they'd been friends with me for years. I was utterly convinced that all these people despised me. This was because I deliberately sought out *excuses* to hate myself - evidence to support the warped view I had of myself. I would focus on every little thing I had done, and either blow it way out of proportion (like a joke that wasn't THAT funny, but could have been worse, becoming the most stupid fucking thing I've ever said) or come up with reasons why they actually hate me for it - which are completely unreasonable. I focused on every little bad thing I'd done and completely ignored everything good, or rationalised the good things to actually be a way to hate myself. So all I saw were bad things, all the time. You, I think, are doing the same. My friends, not being severely depressed, only saw the many good things - good jokes, kind gestures, insightful statements, general friend things - and none of the bad, because I hadn't actually done anything wrong. They thought I was cool. But I just couldn't see it, because I was so determined to prove them all wrong and took such pleasure in destroying myself.   In summary, I can assure you that people love to be around you. You either don't notice the signs or are deliberately telling yourself they're wrong. If they didn't like you, they'd tell you to fuck off to your face.    What are dad jeans?   I find that the fairly standard (as in not too experimental) outfits from /r/malefashionadvice go over well.    Apple in the mouth?   It is, because advise is a different word.    Do males who don't have a no-nonsense exterior still get points for being sensitive? I feel that I don't because I'm not all "manly man" and that being capable of communicating my emotions without being forced at gunpoint has made me unattractive.    Also centre.   Are you sure about colourise?   I don't even know what she was trying to imply. That you actually molested the babysitter?   I %100 agree with what you just said, but how is it relevant to women being encouraged to compare their bodies to media figures more than men?   Yes, but males are taught to compare their ACTIONS to role models - being manly, successful, and rich - whereas women focus on their bodies.   You rarely hear a woman say 'omg, I wish I had her personality.'   You're quite right. If you're attractive enough and you make an approach, a woman is very likely to succeed.   It seems to me that women have the dating world much easier than men.    Women are very, very strongly encouraged by media and society to compare themselves to supermodels. Not so much for men.    This comment makes me sad.    I think it is much easier for women to be attractive than men.    The twist: he's been married for 15 years   I'm a fucking whale.   (cries and reads weightless blogs)   You're not a cave man any more.    As much as I agree with you, please elaborate on why these things are incorrect. It is a thread for newbies, after all.    It's half advice and half bragging about how he's a "master seducer" with "over a hundred lays," "always hanging girls" etc etc. If there wasn't some fairly solid (if distastefully presented) advice in the post I'd suspect he was a fourteen year old virgin    Severely. I hate to say it, but to some people this community has picked up quite a bad reputation in other parts of reddit, and posts like this are what give it that reputation.    The extra room in the head creates more movement, friction with the glans, and thus pleasure.   Such as? We are in a thread for sharing for the unenlightened.   Also: magnum condoms are are wider, not longer. Most people do fit them, and they can increase pleasure quite a lot.  edit: to be precise, they are wider at the head.   Why shouldn't you do it with just anyone? It's not that special - as a matter of fact, it tends to suck for all parties involved - and is best gotten over with quickly so you can practice and actually make it enjoyable.   The pope agrees   dry humour  showers  I beg to differ.   Yeah, as great as this is for OP, it's much easier for him to move on because he knows his ex still cares about him.    Are the women you know anime schoolgirls?   But he was still PHYSICALLY attracted to you. He still would have banged you.   	67

 walk to remember    INMO I left the movie saying the effects were phenomenal. There is more to a movie then special effects. Gravity sweeped a lot of awards but I think also why 12 years a slave won because of the story itself.    Creative title    American Hustle an overhyped film that did not reach the expectations from all the buzz it was getting.   crazy stupid love   Salmon Fishing in the Yemen   I loved it. The music was also great as well.    Thank you. After hearing positive feedback yesterday, I told my parents after my dad told me that the chemo isn't working. It was not easy, but now I feel a lot better getting it off my chest.     Thank you, I needed this. I'm planning to tell my parents soon. Cross my fingers and hope it goes well.   This all means a lot, thank you   Thank you!   So ever since November, I have not been the same. My dad cancer has spread even more and it made me in a darker place that I thought I would never be in. I get up every morning with nothing to really look forward too. The only thing that gets me excited is movies and TV shows which is really sad but honestly the truth. I used to love Skiing and I just went for a few days, but its not the same as it used to be. I told my social worker what I have been feeling down and thinking suicidal thoughs which come and go away, but now she is scared for me. Which makes it worse. She wants me to go book an appt with the doctor and she wants me to tell my parents. My parents know nothing, they think I'm a happy go lucky girl who likes to make others laugh, but when I get home and go into my room its a whole other thing. A part of me just thinks its my head talking and I may not actually be depressed but i have no idea. I just don't want to be judged you know.    So again another friend took me go to see Endless Love. I saw the trailer and I didn't really want to see it as well it didn't do so well on Rotten Tomatoes. The only movie I really want to go see is Veronica Mars, but any how it is not a bad movie. Obviously, it is no where as good as the Notebook or Walk To Remember. It was a cute, romantic movie and the scene where the main female character gets in a car accident scared the living crap out of me. Has anyone seen the 1981 one with Brooke Shields?    Great show!    crossing my fingers!   Be careful because he may just want a friends with benefits thing.    It's nice to see that more people are starting to recognize Elizabeth Olsen.  If you like her, you should watch Liberal Arts and I saw the premiere of "In Secret'' at TIFF. She put on an impressive performance.    LOL yes   Of course, we all knew what was going to happen. But the movie could of been done better. It was so obvious what was going to happen in Titanic, but the movie was 100% times better than Pompeii.       Veronica Mars    So my friends made me see Pompeii in 3D. The film in my opinion was a huge miss and I will forget I even watched this movie because nothing stood out in the movie. It is so obvious what was going to happen. Kiefer Sutherland and Kit Harington star in this flop movie. The effects and the music were good, but the acting and the storyline was lacking. And I just realized that the poster for Pompeii that is on IMDb is actually from the last scene of the movie. So you don't even need to watch the movie you can just look at the poster and you know what will happen. Kiefer Sutherland accent was terrible and he should stick to what he knows which is playing Jack Bauer and shooting people with a gun. What did you think of the movie?   50/50   Agreed!   Ben Affleck/Jennifer Lopez for Gigi (KIDDING)   Okay, so I try to watch as many as I can because I find if I don't watch any at all the award shows are boring. Plus there are some really good movies out there. I have seen every movie that has won main awards and I have seen 80% of all best picture noms. So I look at the Golden Globes or Oscar nominee list and I just check off the ones I've seen. Blue Jasmine is a movie you do not want to miss.   Congrats!!! Being nominated for an Oscar is incredible    I always look at Rotten Tomatoes, because it shows combined with users and critics if the movie is good or not. It does affect the way you watch the film because if you go on a site that says the movie rating is low you will have low expectations of the movie and may not be motivated to watch it, but its the same with good ratings such as American Hustle. American Hustle got great ratings and I was so excited about it, but when I watched it I was bummed because I had such a high expectations of the film because of the cast, director and the great reviews. When I watched it, it did not reach up to its expectations. It's good to know if the movie is worth watching with the ratings, but don't take it too strongly all the time because sometimes a movie that is rotten is actually one of my favourite movies. So it all depends on the individual.    Kristen Bell in Frozen (don't judge), I had no idea that this girl got singing skills    I can see how he can be a villain, but also see as a hero. He is a hero in a way because he helps Iris out. But he is more of a villain, INMO. Yes he saves Foster's character, but I wouldn't call him a hero.    Channing Tatum- overrated, he's easy on the eyes, but other than that I think that's why he's only casted in movie roles. Miles Teller- underrated- Spectacular Now, and apparently his performance in Whiplash stands out as well.   Hard to have one, when there is so many. Bradley Cooper- Sliver Linings Playbook JGL- 50/50    I don't like Girls HBO show   So I just got into House of Lies. Honest truth, there is so much better TV material out there. This is not the best or the worst. It's the entertaining, it takes a while to get into the series. I would watch a few more to decide  if you want to continue on or not because it does get more interesting as eps goes on. Kristen Bell INMO kills it by far then the rest of the cast. There so many great lines in the show worth watching. I say give it one more try   Go house of lies    Brody from Homeland    Easy A, Pitch Perfect (saw four times in the movie theatre), 50/50, sliver linings playbook   This is a little different but Jessica Chastain went from a nobody to a somebody with the success of The Help, Zero Dark Thirty etc.   Robert Downey Jr.   Maybe Sandra Bullock     Did not like the Butler.  Sandra Bullock performance in the Blind Slide was alright, I did not think it was Oscar worthy. Emma Stone needs to stick to comedy   	39
 You made a commitment and you're honoring that commitment. There's nothing wrong with having loyalty but you need to be picky about who gets your loyalty.   I understand you wanting to give him the chance to work things out but it doesn't sound like he's in a place to do that right now.   You can't put forth all the effort. If your marriage is going to work you both have to work at it and it doesn't sound like he's willing to do that.   Ultimately you have to decide what's best for you but after how abusive he's been lately I wouldn't give him another chance. There is never and excuse for that.    Just let it go.   General advice: you need to let the other person know when you're leaving. Sneaking out without saying anything is not cool.   That being said, hook ups are not for everyone. You should sit down and think about how this made you feel and decide if it's something you would do again.   Personally I can't do hook ups, I need to be in a relationship to feel good about the sex. Everyone is different though and you need to decide for yourself.    I love it.  It's my favorite thing to do in bed.   My wife asked me once how I'm so good at it. Answer: Enthusiasm!  I'm going to echo what one commenter said though about one con. Sometimes you get squeezed when she's close to finishing and it's hard to move/breathe.   Of course, that's a little bit of a pro as well. :)   You told him beforehand there was going to be no helping (read, sexual activity) going on and then when he started anyway you told him no.   Yes, he raped you.   Just because it wasn't violent doesn't mean it wasn't rape.   This guy obviously has no respect for boundaries.   You need to stay away from him.  Also, please consider seeking some therapy for your experience.   I understand that feeling.   I would love to know what my STBX is thinking/feeling.   But when I can be honest with myself I realize it doesn't matter and knowing wouldn't make me feel better.   Look at the possibilities:  either she isn't upset by the end of our marriage which makes me feel like crap or she is upset and then I feel like a different kind of crap wondering why we're going through this at all.   The reality is that he probably is upset and does miss you but that doesn't make the reason for ending the marriage any less valid.  You guys have history and it's natural to miss that and be scared of what the future may bring.   But, you can make it.    I'm going to agree with everyone else and say you definitely need a lawyer.   Get in touch with the VA (since you're EOSing) and see what legal options they have available.   My local VA works with 2 different law groups that offer free counsel to veterans.   Additionally you need to start thinking about what you want after the divorce in terms of property and custody. Decide what things you want to keep and how much involvement you want with your kids.   Knowing what you want will make it harder for you to be talked into something you're ultimately uncomfortable with.    You don't mention what the fertility issue is (and you don't have to) but his feelings may stem from that.   He may be feeling like a failure and less of a man because he couldn't impregnate you. This could be causing some minor (or major) depression.   Additionally, even though you guys have decided to stop actively trying he may still be feeling pressure to make something happen.   He also could be feeling disappointed that there is no baby coming. I know it's the stereotype that men don't get excited about babies (or the prospect of babies) but that's not always the case. I'm speaking from personal experience here.   Whatever the problem is, your best course of action is to talk to him. If he won't go into detail on his own, ask him questions (you can start with the possibilities I've stated) and see where that gets you.   Above all, be supportive and don't make statements like 'you're a man, you're supposed to want it all the time'  Again, from personal experience, that helps nothing.    I am going through a divorce (yay, fun times) and while I don't think I'll be ready for another relationship for some time I do have some concerns about being back on the market.   I have been with my wife for 11 years. Before her I only had 3 sexual partners. One was a one night stand, one was just oral, and the other was not at all healthy. So, I've learned and experienced basically all of my sex with one person.   I am confident that I know what I'm doing with her. Our sex life is not the reason for the split.   I'm a little worried about how my skills will transfer though. I know everyone is different and I worry that I may be stuck in habits that won't work with another woman. How much importance do you place on a first time with a new partner?  If it's not amazing are you likely to decide to move on?  Also, I question how my comparative lack of experience will come across. Ladies, do you find it a turn off that a man has had few partners?   When my parents divorced (I was 26) my father stopped communicating with me and all my sisters.   I was (understandably, I think) hurt by this and I tried to repair the relationship years later but all the effort was on my part so that inevitably failed.   I realized, though, that the relationship I had previously with my father was always guided by my mother.  Given your close relationship with your father I wouldn't expect you to suffer the same but you should realize that your relationship will be different, with both of your parents.   Lean on your husband and sister for support and be there for your mom and dad as much as you can (without getting caught in the middle). As you've noticed, even with agreement, divorce is hard.   They're going to have a tough time with it and you and your sister are as well. But, if you can all be there for each other then you'll all come through it ok.    I know how you feel.   My wife (of 9 years) wants out and all I want is to be able to fix things and have my best friend and partner back.   What's helped me feel (a tiny bit) better is being able to reflect clearly on our past and realize that she's never really been the partner I wanted/needed.   I don't know if that's the case for you or not but I totally understand your feelings about wishing things could go back.    Thankfully I was able to realize that I was in a bad place and get help.   My sister has been awesome helping me through this.   I'm still working on forgiving myself for marrying someone who isn't nice.  I can mostly admit now that the way she treats me isn't healthy or acceptable and that it's not my fault.  Sometimes I can think that things will work out better for me after we're done. Sometimes, though, I get stuck thinking about what I could have done to fix things between us.   I can't help feeling like a failure.   It's ironic because neither of our respective parents are still married but I actually thought that we could make it.    I have been seeing a therapist which I think is helping a little.   Fact is, I  was feeling really depressed and wanting to kill myself. I spent basically all of Feb in the hospital trying to feel better.   And while I was there she called me once and never came to visit. I got to see my kids once because my sister was able to bring them to me.   My wife told me after I was admitted that she couldn't support me.   The fucked up part is that even after everything that's happened and how shitty she's treating me I still love her.   I miss her and want to talk to her and be able to touch her again.   And every time she texts me, even though I know it's just going to be something about bills or the kids' schedules, I get a little thrill. I'm still excited to hear from her even though she's stopped wearing her rings and she 'has no responsibility towards me as a wife anymore' (that's a direct quote).   This will be long, sorry in advance.   My wife told me shortly after the new year that she wanted a divorce. In her opinion we are too different to ever work out and she doesn't want to waste her time working on a relationship that's destined to fail.  At the same time (earlier that day even) I found a text conversation between her and a coworker that bordered on inappropriate and definitely made me feel uncomfortable and jealous.   About a week later after multiple conversations and arguments (and not a little bit of crying on my part) I found another conversation between them that was way more explicit and totally inappropriate. Basically they were talking about how they could wait to fuck when they had the chance.   She hasn't really given me any real reasons for wanting a divorce, just want seems like excuses: We're too different, we don't like the same things, she found herself attracted to this other guy.   Supposedly nothing physical happened between them.   I just feel like every 'reason' she's given me could be worked on between us (through therapy as well) but she has no interest.   I've been feeling really depressed about my whole life and trying to find ways past this.   I've finally accepted that's there's nothing I can say/do to change her mind.   We've been sleeping separately for a couple weeks now and I just feel so lonely.   Some details people will probably ask:  We have 2 kids; 5 and 8 We've been married 9 years (anniversary in Dec), together for 11 Nothing has been filed yet, I have retained a lawyer   For the Earth Arena coming up I have:  Zelnite x2 Dilma Ophelia  For my last spot, should I use Miku or Douglas?  I've heard Douglas is bad but he's 6* and she's only 5*   Yes  	15

 Any suggestions?     How old is everyone in this thread? You think now is bad? There was a time things were much much worse with our rail system... it's actually pretty good now in comparison.    Also I heard someone say once that the employees who are happiest are the ones who know they are learning skills and could get another job... and so they are less likely to leave their current job.    What did you do before and what do you do now? I have also been considering a career change.   They're making some interesting Big Macs.   My bus is always packed and it would be completely unreasonable to expect someone to get off at a particular door. You always go to the one that is closest.   There are no real rules on buses except I think most people try to be nice to each other. It's bad enough we have to cram into a tube with 50-70 other people. We are all probably not that happy about it.    Really the worst thing for me is when someone really stinks badly and there is nowhere else for me to move to. It's probably the only thing that will make me get off a bus and wait for the next one.    Yeah I've also noticed there are a lot of devs that have done a masters degree here and got a job after that.    Try applydirect.com.au too - I no longer apply to recruiters. For me it is a waste of time.    Our company is in a niche area and we hire heaps of people from overseas. Actually as an Australian I am in the minority here. If you're not in a niche then I agree it is probably difficult. A lot of people I know from the UK have already been employed by companies like pwc and then it was an internal transfer within their company to Australia.   One interview I went to the guy asked for my current pay and then said "oh, I thought it would be less than that" and I was on like $12 an hour.   Ah. Maybe my great aunt was just really weird then lol   If it helps, my mum's aunt was very traditional British and wanted my mum to return to England to marry her cousin. My great aunt didn't understand why that was wrong either. But at the end of the day my mum made her own decision (not incest obviously!).   It must be frustrating but I suppose the best you can do is talk to your parents and ask them not to stereotype and  guide your daughter to help her make her own mind up about what she likes or doesn't like.   Me and my sister played with mud and foil tins. No we weren't poor. We just liked it. :) I feel as though kids toys are overly complicated these days. Maybe it's good to have a mix.   I can understand why grandparents might do that though. They grew up in a very different world. Not saying they should just that they don't see how it's insane.   Mine were like that too. I had each side done while awake. The first side went very well. Second side I got dry socket. Has to be among the worst pain I have experienced in my life. I drugged myself up and tried to sleep through it for a few days.   Did they have to shoot it? Would it be possible to just cut its horns?   I loooove their cakes. My favourite is the blackforest cake. David Jones at Elizabeth St also has a really good one!    What is your favorite way to pay tax?   If you need to take something with you like lunch and it's stored in the fridge, put your keys on top of it and you won't forget to take it.    Set aside some time by yourself with nothing planned. You can just do whatever you feel like doing at the time and live life in the present. Making plans sometimes means doing stuff you don't feel like doing just because you planned it.    Stretch when you first wake up in the morning. I don't mean just wave your arms about and yawn, I mean really try to stretch all the major muscles. You will feel a lot better the rest of the day.   Before you leave work each day write a list of things you need to do the next day. This lets you leave work at work and stop wasting time when you get to work in the morning.   A beautiful scenic shot taken on one of my trips with my loved ones in it. The scenery because I would miss the vast open spaces and it would remind me of a trip that I enjoyed and give me hope for more. And loved ones because it would remind me I have people worth living for and it would remind me that I'm a person who other people care about.    I think our service is a bit shitty though generally unless it's a top class restaurant. Even then sometimes it's hit and miss. Although I prefer not having to pay tips I think having to earn it would mean service would be better.   You should have the nicest stuff first. It tastes even nicer when you're properly hungry.   Hehe I hadn't seen this. This was great. :)   My mum told me when I was younger flossing was bad for your gums and I believed her. I just had $4000 worth of dental work with another $6000 needed. Floss dammit!!   That is a stupid rule anyway. If I care about someone I will tell them things they might not find nice but need to hear. Timing is important. It's like someone got the timing wrong once, then this rule was made up.   It's great you two are motivating each other. My partner and I are doing the same... though we're not ready for obstacle courses yet. And you and your partner look great. The hard work has really paid off :)   I feel like this too. We really had the best of both worlds. I was always on the computer but when I wasn't I was out with friends or riding my bike or at the beach.   I used to like going to the library and using paper, pens and books. There was a study area when I went to uni in the early 2000s which just consisted of desks with space for your books. They replaced it and now there are just computers everywhere. I used to like that the library was a place to kind of focus without the distractions that you have on a computer or laptop.   Tell that to the humans.   I'll be honest, and I am ashamed of it now - I was initially not a fan of the cycling lanes in Sydney's CBD. When they were first being built people weren't using them and I felt they didn't really go anywhere. While some of that was true in construction, it was incredibly ignorant and short-sighted. There has been such a great acceptance and uptake of those bike lanes, I wonder how I could have ever had that opinion now.   I questioned why I felt this way and I decided to give cycling in the city a go (albeit on a weekend because I am scared of being run down by crazy cars). It was great. I don't enjoy riding on the roads but with the cycling lanes it feels a lot safer and I really could enjoy it a lot. I even started riding to work.   I think people don't like cyclists mostly because they haven't done it, and they are ignorant and selfish. I'll admit that is exactly what I was at the time, and it was wrong.   I have seen both bad cyclists and bad drivers, but I feel that the attitudes in Sydney at least towards the bike paths and cyclists are slowly changing. I think with more good bike paths that will help as more people start trying them out and taking it up.   There is one thing I still have a gripe with and that is those lay-down bikes with the little flag (I think they're called Recumbent Bikes). I saw a guy nearly get run over by a truck riding one of those down through the city centre on the non-bike lanes. They're impossible for cars to see, and he's almost asking for whatever fate happens to him.     Wash your feet in warm water. I always feel better all over if my feet feel nice and clean.   I saw this on the plane and there weren't any subtitles. :(   Relevant: http://mobile.firehouse.com/news/11381039/brooklyn-blazes-leaves-two-nypd-cops-critically-hurt   Where does milk come from?

There are ways to get cheaper tickets tho. You can get $10 Hoyts tickets through Optus. And I think Telstra does Greater Union tickets for about the same.    I was just there! Here's the same spot from my car: http://imgur.com/4aavn75  And at milsons pt side http://imgur.com/FFK8h6y   I left North Sydney at 5:30. Decided to park and have a break and pull over at 7:30. Still not home...  I picked a bad day to drive to work!   That makes sense but then I was thinking about 2 core processors or 6 core. They're not square either. I think you're onto something though. It could be about how common circuitry can be shared between cores.   I was thinking the base is square so the fan can sit on top neatly. And fans have to be round.   Could it be related to the temperature? It is one of the less obvious reasons for sleeping issues. [Source]( http://www.sleepfoundation.org/article/how-sleep-works/the-sleep-environment).   My guess is that it's the way information is stored and processed.   Binary encoding for data representation is made of bits. A bit is an on/off state which can be used to perform calculations. If you use a larger number of bits for example you can start representing numbers. For example 0101 in binary is 0x2^(3) + 1x2^(2) + 0x2^(1) + 1x2^(0) which gives you the number 5.   Most of the time processors are built for even number 8, 16, 32, 64 bit length calculations. I think this is because the length of a byte is 8. Why is it 8 bits? It was just what was popular at the time.  Source: [here]( http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte)  So my guess is that it grew from those origins and they stuck with the even number theme.   Two main reasons: 1. High Sugar  2. High Caffeine and/or Other Stimulants   When you eat sugar, your body tries to regulate itself. It does this by causing the pancreas (an organ in your body that makes digestive enzymes to break down your food) to produce a hormone called insulin which helps your body absorb the sugar and turn it into energy or else store it for later use. When you have a lot of sugar, the pancreas tries to produce more insulin to cope. But doing this often can damage the pancreas and over time it can no longer function properly and can't produce enough insulin. Poor insulin creation or absorbtion is a condition called diabetes. If left untreated, all this extra sugar floating around in your blood causes your blood vessels to harden and this can lead to a bunch of nasty conditions like kidney failure, heart attacks, blindness, nerve damage, etc.   Source: [here](http://www.webmd.com/diabetes/how-sugar-affects-diabetes?page=2) and for more information on the 2 types of diabetes see [here](http://www.nobelprize.org/educational/medicine/insulin/diabetes-insulin.html)   Sugar is also terrible for your teeth, and its presence causes the acidity in your mouth to increase as you break down the sugar. When the acidity level in your mouth increases, it eats away at the enamel of your teeth, causing tooth decay.   Source: [here](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/26/health/the-mouths-guard.html?_r=0)   Not to mention if you are having a lot of sugar all the time you are likely to be eating more than your daily required intake of Calories/kilojoules and become overweight, which can lead to a number of other health issues.    Caffeine can actually be good in small doses, as it stimulates your central nervous system and causes your heart rate to increase. It is also a diuretic (makes you need to go to the bathroom). A high heart rate can be useful when you need increased mental alertness but it can be bad if you are trying to sleep. It can also have other side effects such as headaches and vomiting if in really high doses. Large amounts of caffeine can also reduce calcium absorbtion and can increase your chance of developing osteoporosis (thin bones).   If caffeine is not present they use other stimulants like guarana to have the same effect.   Also when these stimulants are combined with alcohol they can mask how drunk you are, so you are likely to drink more than you might otherwise.   Source: [here](http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002445.htm)  and [here](http://brown.edu/Student_Services/Health_Services/Health_Education/alcohol,_tobacco,_ _other_drugs/energy_drinks.php)      Maybe it depends on what you're doing at those times. The hormone Melatonin is released at night causing you to feel sleepy, but it is affected by the amount of light. Maybe if you are in front of a light source, it is disrupting what you body expects to be its daily pattern or circadian rhythm.    Here is another one - I tried using lightroom also on the modified photo to add in some vignetting so the edges are darker: http://imgur.com/BdY29kZ   It's tough because there is so much noise in the photo I blurred it out a bit to make it less noticeable. I have tried sharpening it again but it just adds the graininess back in and it didn't look so great. See here: http://imgur.com/5c1dO9w  I just tried increasing the contrast - this might be a little bit better - it doesn't look as blurry: http://imgur.com/jrQ0XNQ  Maybe someone else on reddit can help?   How do you get rid of the bumps like that? I have a couple of photos of my own that I want to do that for.   How's this? http://imgur.com/9OMpZki   Are the grey clouds meant to be there or was there a spill on the photo?   I think that is the same here in Australia. I love Pepsi Max but I can't drink it because it makes me need to pee really badly. No other cola does that to me. I chose it at first because it was cheaper than Coke but now I'm onto caffeine free Pepsi Light.   Yeah it's probably a last resort option though.

Ours is a little higher but then our cost of living is pretty high too, especially in Sydney.  http://www.fairwork.gov.au/pay/national-minimum-wage/Pages/default.aspx   I'm not sure if it's directly related, but we often don't have the best service in Australia though. I read somewhere that it's due to changes in formal waitstaff training offerings, but having tips as an incentive must help too.   I wanted to save it. I mean that thing has got to be like 1000 years old. But when it started charging at us we had to put it down. :( I am sad but relieved at the same time.    Edit: I'm sorry for the nightmares! They're actually pretty cool spiders (they kill other pesky insects), and they aren't that poisonous but I just don't like them in my bedroom anymore.  Last time I had one almost as big as this in my bedroom I let him be for 3 days. He didn't move at all so I thought it was fine. But on day 4 I came in the door and he actually charged towards me. I don't think he wanted to be friends anymore...   He was sitting right above my bed - actually had to get up on the bed to get him. As soon as we went in the door with the container to trap him he reared up ready for attack. I thought he might run and hide behind the picture, but as we got closer he climbed up onto the tiger picture with both front legs up ready for a fight. By the way, for reference the picture is 32cm (12.5") wide. So he must have been about 8-10cm wide including legs. One of the biggest huntsman I've ever seen.       [This guy](http://g-ecx.images-amazon.com/images/G/01/askville/4725073_55886428_mywrite/2100734030047620693wapafafs.jpg)   I try not to worry about what everyone else is doing. As long as you are doing what you want to do, and if you want these other things, then as long as you are making an effort to go get them, then hopefully things will fall into place when the time is right for you.   I had a collie rough growing up and I swear he understood every word when I would talk to him about all my troubles. He would come right up and nudge me and I'd hug him, and I would never feel alone as long as he was there.    Cool. I found it in the SAS Survival Guide (little pocket book which is great to carry around): http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/295358.SAS_Survival_Guide   According to my survival book, you can obtain it from some plants such as the roots of hickory trees in North America or of the nipa palm in southeastern Asia. Boil the roots until all the water evaporates and black salt crystals are left.  If no direct salt sources are available then you can get it second hand through animal blood.   The Cronulla riots happened over 7 years ago now. I wish we could all move on from it.    How did you go with this? Is it still leaking?   It's bizarre isn't it? I know of plenty of organisations and people that still use faxes and it pretty much always surprises me.    We have had a lot of these in my mum's backyard lately. They have been feeding on caterpillars and getting really fat while breeding (I keep finding lots of egg sacs near the spiders I find). I kill them when I see them but they mostly just try to run and hide in crevices. I always feel bad killing spiders because they are sorting out much worse insects in my backyard like flies. Still, they make me feel uncomfortable.  I actually left a huntsman in my bedroom for a few days because I know they're pretty harmless but one day I walked into my room and it reared up and started running towards me. That was the end of our relationship.   I just use white vinegar and it works really well, it's cheap and safe for the environment. Also it doesn't scrape off any layers of paint that I am aware of.   TIL about lava soap. We have something similar - orange scrub: http://www.septone.com.au/detail.asp?item_cat= item_number=31 page_num=2  Smells like oranges too.   Well, the best water level is water. :) Gotta make sure those hedges are trimmed to perfection! When the water level goes down, it's the first thing people will notice.   Good thing they had their headlights on or they wouldn't have been able to see where they were going!!   Floodpants or a dinghy...   Someone needs to make a book of best-of reddit posts for deperate redditors for when there are internet outages. I'd do it but I'm busy reading reddit at the moment.    There's been more information on the Townsville Bulletin website and some updates are [here](http://www.townsvillebulletin.com.au/article/2013/01/28/374359_news.html). The emergency services numbers have been on ABC 24 all day, but without details of where/why etc.    I went to a restaurant (Mad Pizza yum) yesterday and we ordered wood fired pizzas and pasta. The air con in that place wasn't working too well. We sat in there wiping off our sweat with napkins. I kept looking in the kitchen. Really felt bad for that poor guy in there with the pizza oven. But the food was good :)   It was in the Shire not Western Sydney and it was a long time ago. Probably in the 90's. Maybe 20 years ago now.   There are really only two hot years I remember out of probably many - the one when my goldfish died, and the one when a whole lot of my neighbours lost their houses and were sitting in our street with their cars full of whatever they could grab as they had to abandon their homes.  Anyway - Sucks to be in Western Sydney right now!!    I was only a little kid and it was almost an extra room of the house with walls on 3 sides, and normally when it's not that hot the fish is fine... just not on that day. I realised about half way through the day and went to get him to bring him inside but it was too late :(    I wonder if jogging on a day like today would even begin to give you an idea of how hot a firefighter gets when they're fighting a bushfire.   I mean there are firefighters out there right now - so I suppose it must feel a thousand times hotter in their suits, with the heat from an actual fire on top of the heat that is hotter than the city. Not to mention more life threatening. They deserve a lot of respect.   * Edit - wanted to include a pic of firefighters fighting fires in Western Sydney (Penrith) today: http://images.smh.com.au/2013/01/18/3963493/DA-BDO-20130118160305578810-600x400.jpg (Source - SMH: "Rural Fire Service volunteers fight a grass fire on Andrews St, Penrith. Photo: Mick Tsikas")   No but it stopped! But soon there will be thunder and lightning and more rain... If you trust bom.   The hottest day I remember in Sydney before this was 44C. There might have been hotter days before or after that but I remember because it was the day I forgot about my goldfish outside on the patio and the water boiled. Rip fishy. :-(    I had so many people tell me that and now ten years on, I can tell you that at least for me high school was the worst years of my life and I am so damn grateful those years are over. If you're in highschool don't believe it. It might be true for some people, but it's not a blanket rule. My life is so much better now.      Thanks. I've done a little bit more. I don't know how much more time I would be willing to spend on it as there is a lot of work involved but perhaps someone else would like to give it a go. Here's the results of what I've done:  http://imgur.com/3N3m7 (cropped)  http://imgur.com/mUGlh,QqdfD#0 (without green discolouration)  http://imgur.com/mUGlh,QqdfD#1 (with green discolouration)  I can't really fix the boy's face as it would require redrawing it as there is so much missing, so I've left the tear over it. Maybe with another picture someone can help you out.  I'm also kind of new at this so I don't really know how to get rid of the green without losing too much photo quality. I did my best.  Good luck!   I did a bit of work on their faces but I need to go to sleep now: http://imgur.com/CIfkd I'll see what I can do tomorrow.  Btw, the boy second from the left is going to be a little bit difficult to reconstruct because of how much of his face is missing. Do you have any other photos of him?   Do you have a higher resolution scan? That would be really helpful. There is quite a lot of damage to the photo.   haha this one made me laugh. :)   No problem :) Glad I could help!    http://i.imgur.com/gSxGv.jpg - I think this came out pretty well.  For those who are doing something on it still, this was my first attempt: http://i.imgur.com/xkY9N.jpg I tried to reduce the white flare on the left a bit so the photo is more even.  Then it wasn't quite even on the right, so I've used j00jy's version and created a multiply layer to even out the flare on both sides and got the above.  By the way, I'm really sorry to hear about your cousin :(       Yeah I like the Australian Reptile Park better cause it's less crowded and some of the animals like kangaroos and emus roam freely, and they have nicer enclosures than both the zoo and the city one, but the downside is that it's also far if you're a tourist. I really like the Galapagos tortoise, the croc enclosure and the Tassie devils there. I guess koala park or featherdale could be another option, but not sure as I haven't been there since I was a little kid. Taronga zoo is ok for Australian animals too. The koala enclosure is good as you can walk up and view them from a high platform, and they have a few small crocs. I don't remember anything about being able to hold them though. Apparently [govt regulations don't allow it anymore](http://taronga.org.au/animalencounter) . They do have a walk around section now you mention it which was pretty good.     I agree with everything you said! My ring is not 3 months salary but is so amazing. He designed it and picked the stones himself at a family jeweller. To me it is perfect. I have the most beautiful engagement ring. I've since seen ones with bigger price tags and would never trade. You know what really makes it extra beautiful is not the ring itself but what it represents and more importantly who it comes with :) That's what I think of whenever I see it... not the price tag.    - Taronga Zoo - Sydney Harbour/The Rocks - You should probably go to at least one beach (Bondi is the most touristy, Manly is where all the expats live, Coogee is another city beach option). Manly has an arts   crafts market on Sunday (http://www.ourmanly.com.au/Travel/manly-markets.aspx). - Sydney is known for markets, depending on how much you like markets there are just so many... [This](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_markets_in_Sydney) is not a bad list but the best for tourists (near the city) are probably Paddy's Markets near Central Station, The Rocks market, Manly Arts   Crafts and Paddington Markets. Don't get all market-ed out though. They are not all places to get a bargain - some, like the Rocks and Paddington Markets can be expensive. - Harbour Bridge climb is an option (costs $$ but I hear it's good), or if you prefer you can just walk across it for free. - Visit some kind of national park and go walking - There are some good ones around the city, but if you want the real bush then you need to go to a bigger one and you need a car to get there - for example The Royal National Park or Ku-ring-gai Chase National Park. If you're really keen then you could also go to the Blue Mountains. There's some WW2 gunner stations at Mosman which are interesting to walk around, and have a great view. Again though, not easy to get to without a car. - Go to some sort of wildlife park - especially if you're not from Australia. One that is easy to get to is the Reptile Park in the city next to Sydney Aquarium. They have crocs and other Australian animals there. - While you're there you may as well go to the acquarium. It's not bad, they have penguins and stuff. - You could do a harbour lunch cruise - try get a deal (like on ouffer or something) and it should cost you about $50 for lunch on a cruise boat.   For gigs: http://www.bombshellzine.com/gigguide/gigs.htm http://www.yourgigs.com.au/sydney/?  There's probably more things I could suggest, but that's all I have off the top off my head right now.   I agree with the others about the salary being decent.  Off topic slightly, but related to income... Check out this page about LAFHA (Living Away From Home Allowance) - it could be useful: http://www.lafha.com.au/Employees.aspx  There's been some changes in this year's budget in relation to it, due to people abusing the system, but I think (depending on the sort of visa you get) you can still get it. I know most people at my company have LAFHA payments, as we have a lot of staff coming from overseas due to our skills shortage. Check out the bottom of that page for more details. There's probably some more stuff on expat forums as well you could search for.   My cat had pretty long fur and had really bad fleas once and was running around biting random objects and jumping around like she was on fire. I had to give her a bath to get rid of some fleas and then we put her on flea medicine after that. Probably should have done that in the first place.     Why does the girl look so disgusted at the kitten?  	95
 transtrenders can be of any kind, not specifically of non-binaries (nor that I'm saying nonbinaries are necessarily transtrenders)  there is no policing or invalidation if the case study is what it is   that was part/conclusion of the study. I'm not hiding facts here, she said that being a man while still a woman was hurting her.  and I'm sorry that happened to you. There's no such things as not being dysphoric enough. Just either you are or you are not.   are they women that are fine with being men and thus are defined as men?  because Norah still feels/felt like a woman while being disguised as a man. That's why it was hard for her.   okay fair enough, I do believe in androgynous and agender (although they do fit into the definition of binary) but all other non-binaries claim a 'third gender' which is what I was referring more to         you are just assuming homosexuality is moral, which is what this argument is trying to prove/disprove. you have circular reasoning.   regardless of my stance on homosexuality and I am not trying to prove/go against it, I just want to get rid of this fallacious argument.  what I mean is that people say homosexuality is found in many species, okay so what? on the other hand people go against nature to justify gender issues??  cannibalism or eating their young ones, rape, destroying another one's genitals, fight to death, leaving disabled ones to die out, and other behavior is found in other species, does that make it okay? (I know things like cannibalism is still practiced in certain cultures but the idea is we still view it as 'wrong')   sona can get too boring to play really fast (not to mention the multiple nerfs, like 30) for such a huge investment; not amount of fancy particles is going to make it more enjoyable (unless they just overhaul her kit I'm talking about in-game effects, for example remove cc with her heal and what not).  also, in my opinion: might as well not give the discount since the discount is fairly meaningless.  Ezreal doesn't get boring fast (although may the skin might since all skills are blue but w/e). and Udyr certainly has dynamics.  	9
