 As an American, for example, I always assumed Russia exactly like it is in Rocky 4. What're your perceptions?    You don't know what you're talking about. That much I can assure you.    lol okay man   I'm not bashing Wes Anderson, because for the most part I enjoy his work, but I really don't think he's the creative genius r/movies makes him out to be. Just an opinion.    You either completely misunderstood what OP posted, or you're a troll. Pick one.    The worst Frasier fan theory I have ever heard.   No, but I apparently am not the only one who was misled judging by comments and posts in this thread and sub.    I am so sorry to take up your valuable time on Reddit. But here are the facts of the situation. Bryan Cranston, hot off his Breaking Bad fame, get casted in a new blockbuster where he, and HE ALONE, dominated the trailer. You can defend as much as you want, but it doesn't change the fact it was marketed as though Cranston would be a bigger part of the movie. And why wouldn't they? People like me who have no interest in Godzilla, but have an interest in Break Bad's star would go see the movie. You have not made one concrete point to the contrary. I'm sorry you're annoyed, but your position is tough to defend when there are 30 different trailers you could pull up to prove my point.    Ah I didn't know HBO had a series. Was it live action or animated?   its a COSBY SWEATAH!!!!   WHAT.....FUCKING......IAN GUY?!   Casting a better Clown than Jon Leguizama-nagga-nagga-whatshisname would be difficult. He was so damn disgusting and amazing in that role.    So, you're saying they didn't use Cranston to sell the movie? That's your position?    False advertising. At least that's my complaint. If he wasn't such a huge part of the trailer, it wouldn't bug me in the slightest. But it was advertised like he was the star and it is very clear why they did that. For example, it didn't bug me in the slightest that Ben Affleck was killed off immediately in Smokin Aces. Everyone knew he was in it, but it wasn't marketed like he was the star. Huge difference.     I did, yes. I thought it was pretty good actually.    I don't recall seeing the preview. Can you elaborate?   Observe and Report was very similar. It looked so goofy and ended up being wayyyy weird and dark.    I have to disagree with you. It was obvious that Godzilla used Cranston to sell the movie in the trailer. Their marketing wasn't as strategic as your comment may suggest.    When Godzilla came out, Bryan Cranston dominated every TV spot. When we went and saw it, my friends and I were seriously upset when his character died 25 minutes into the movie.       Cliff!   Why do you say that? Not trying to be argumentative, but it seemed like a great board for AK. I'm newer, so I'd appreciate the insight.    Hahaha my bad, was writing on the go. But you get the gist.    Spot on. Spot. fucking. on.    They still make them, but no one sees them. I could still get down all day on 3 Ninjas :)   Not to mention, if the claim is true, he could be a very dangerous fugitive on the run.   I'm a little confused about something. When the local police are investigating Tom on his identity to see if there is any weight to the mob's claim that he is someone else, why are they simply just asking him? Couldn't they actually do some investigation (SSN, birth cert, etc...) to verify his identity? He's a pretty popular member of his community.    Oh I wasn't implying you were paranoid. It reads like cheating to me too.    To be fair, and I'm not suggesting you are doing this, there are A LOT of people who start claiming collusion in some of the sit n go tourneys when they start losing. In a particular hand (you'll have to forgive me as I don't recall specifics), I was dealt small pocket pair like 2s and raised from late position. Big blind called me and it was heads up. Flop was a bunch of faces and he and I checked it down. Turned out he had a smaller pocket pair. But another player,small stacked and not in the hand, started accusing he and I of colluding. I think it may be a way of some players acting out their tilt. In your case, it does sound different however.    I always get misty at that scene. Specifically when he starts crying. Tom Hanks is seriously solid for making people feel sad in that scene. I remember in theaters when Wilson first plops into the water while Hanks is sleeping, MANY murmured "oh no!" Incredible movie.    John Ritter. He was even the "model" father in North at the end of North's list of parents. He's perfect.    I like to have WSOP on while doing online tourneys are literally just heard Norman Chad say that moments before reading this haha your point has been made.   How to play a hand for example, or styles. What are the issues most commonly debated?   Idk why everyone just got downvoted. You literally answered my question....  	34
    What cat?  I didn't see a cat.  I also switched to pornhub within about 10 seconds   College is fun, but your real fun is after when you can afford and do a lot more.  Moral of the story, have fun but remember why you are there      No, read about it    That's aircraft is actually what prompted the question   Thank you        	9
 I recently moved to an older part of town that is being renovated, mostly by the hipster crowd. Since dropping out of college, my parents refused to pay my bills, so I was left with few options. This lead me to get a job at one of the the non-renovated buildings, a gas station that looks like it's been there since the 1970's.  You could say I was less than thrilled. My parents had money, and I never worked a day in my life. I was shocked that any place would hire me, but since the area was a hipster haven, not many people wanted to work at the gas station. Honestly, it's so slow. I don't know how it's still open. Because the volume of customers, I spend a lot of time on my phone or occasionally looking through the small offices area that is shared by all the workers. One day as I was looking, I came across a journal that was a little more than weird. Other than spelling, I changed punctuation to make it more readable.  "August 25, 1984  We finally got a gas stashun like the one the next town over, Owensville! Guess who got a job?! THat's right! I did! My pa is so proud that I'm a workin' man! I've started this journel to 'member my furst job!"  August 28, 1984  I started trainin' today! I don't think I'm goin' to like this job as much as I thoght. They asked mE to work nite shift since I dropped out of high scool." In a town like this, their's no one out at nite, so it luks like you'll be hereing from me a lot!"  "August 29, 1984  The person training me jus left. He said I should be ok for a bit because I need to be used to being aLone and having to solve problems without a manager since I'll be alone my whole 11pm-7am shift. I hope I can handle the store alone. My biggest fear is being robed thogh. I here that haPpens alot here in town. Since I live in the country, the worst thing that happens is a bit of cow tippin."  "August 30, 1984  Well, this is worse than I thoght! It's 2am, and I've only had 1 person, and I already finished my cleanin'. What aM suppost to do for the next 5 hours? What's worse is that my pa expects me to help plow the feilds tomorrow at 8:30am because I'm off tomarr nite. I wish I coud work day time time, but boss says I'm rite were he needs me. Maybe, I can save my monee and move to town like sum of my friends. Then, I coud sleep and do what ever I want. He can't make me work if I ain't there."  "September 3, 1984  Sorry it's ben so long. Pa found out 'bout my plan to move from the farm, and wouldn't let me go bak to work. He said my job is in the fEilds providing' for my famly. Boss called quite a few times the furst day I missed work. Pa didn't let me me anser, so that nite, I sneaked out and ran all the way to town. It took a while, but now I'm a free man. I'm stayin' with my friend, Jakob, until I save monee. I went to boss yesturday and explained why I hadn't been at work. He was mad, but said he needed me to bad to fir me. He said he would keep a eye on me thouh. I'm not too happy here, but it's my way out of the farm."  "September 4, 1984  Welp, it's dead agin. I might get used to this. It lets me think about my life. I might go take my GED, since I have all this time to learn. Pa made me quit scool to help him, but he woodn't even look at me when I seen him in town. That's ok thouh. My boss says I might have a future hear at the stashun if I don't screw up no more. Even though, I don't have monee yet, I've been lookin' for places. By the end of the month, I mite have my own place."  "September 29, 1984  Sorry, it's been so long. Like I told you last time, I went to get my GED. I failed the first time because I fell asleep after a long shift here. It's ok though because I sceduled a new one yesterday, since I was off last night, and I passed it! It was very exciting! Boss says with my GED, I might get his position one day. That would be nice. I'd get to be around people again. I moved out of Jacob's a few days ago, and I thought I would like living alone. Now, I realize how alone I am working night shift. The only people I talk to are the guy that I relieve and Boss who relieves me. I'm sure I'll get used to it or get the manager's job when he leaves."  "October 3rd, 1984  I got great news today! Boss said he's promoting me to assistant manager. He says I'll still be on night shift though. I don't know why night shift needs a manager when it's only me, but he gave me a raise. So I guess it's ok."  "October 30, 1984  The lights keep flickering, and it doesn't matter what I do. They keep flickering and making a slight click sound. Even though, I turned the lights off, there's still that horrible clicking. I don't know how I haven't heard it before."  "November 15, 1984  It's getting cold here, but I can't get the heater to work. The clicking is still happening, but no one else seems to hear the sound. Boss says it's all in my head from being lonely, but he gives me a funny smile when he says it."  "December 1, 1984  "I've come to like the clicking. It's almost a friend. I don't have friend anymore. There's too much to do here. How can I have friends when I need to take care of the station? Anytime I think of leaving to get another job, I hear the clicking getting louder and faster, as if begging me to stay."  "January 10, 1985  I wish I could say I'm sorry for not writing, but I'm not. This will be the last entry. Now that I have the clicking as company, I don't need to write anymore. I finally have friends and almost a family again. Thanks for the company during the lonely nights, but I'll never be alone again. *NEVER AGAIN*.  Goodbye,  Alexander Samuels"  Since I found this journal, I have started hearing a clicking, but I know it's all in my imagination because it started after I read the journal. I'll keep you posted  **Update**  After all the lonely nights, I decided to start a journal. I don't need dates because it's only to comfort me.  Entry 1  My friends don't want to Hang out with me anymore. They say that since I started working that I'm too tired to too busy to party with them. ThEy'll never know what it's like to have to work and pay your own bills. They won't be missed reaLly. I want peoPle like Me who know the lonely pain... I mEan the thrill of working night shift. I've still been hearing the clicking, but I guess it's because I keep thinking about that journal.  Entry 2  My old friends came by today and asked why I hadn't been talking to them. I was confused. They didn't want me around, but when I tried to show them the texts, they looked at me like I was crazy because they weren't there. I know they sent them. The must be trying to make fun of me. I don't need them anyway. I don't have time for them.  Entry 3  I talked to the boss today about the clicking. He got a strange smile and told me it would be okay. For the first time, I noticed his name was Alexander Samuels. That sounds so familiar, but I don't remember where from. It doesn't really matter though. I am happy with the easy chatter of the station. The boss also said I might have a future here, and he's been thinking about promoting me. That would be too exciting!  Entry 4  Working in a gas station in an almost abandoned town can have an effect on you. Especially when you always work graveyard alone.  I never realized the changes in myself from sitting in a small, dirty box for over 8 hours, 5 days a week.  It happens so slowly that you don't realize how fast your sanity can escape when you're isolated, working graveyard shift at an almost abandoned gas station.  I no longer want to leave my station. This is my family. My friends. My home.  You can be a part of our family too. Just come with me and join the night crew.      She hasn't come back, and I haven't heard a word from my manager. I'm assuming she didn't care enough to just call the next day. Either way, it wouldn't have affected me.   I always that it came from the crappy idea that customers are always right. They are not always right. Sometimes they are very, very wrong.   Yes! Sorry! Should have made it more clear!   When I told her between 10:30-11   If you've read my posts before, you know that I work for a decently large grocery store in the fuel center. First of the month is always the best time to be working (sarcasm). As most people know, this weekend is America's Independence Day, so that means they're even worse than normal.  A fine example of this is Screaming Creature (SC for short). I've already dealt with the people who still seem to fail to understand how a gas pump works or that I don't have a "fill up" button for your car, so my day was already going well.  I thought it couldn't get worse, until SC walks up to my window. The following conversation took place:  Me: May I help you?  SC: What time you close?  Me: We normally close between 10:30 and 11.  It depends if the people inside the store come out to give us a lunch. If they don't, we have to close 30 minutes early so we don't get over time.  SC: I don't care about that! I asked what time you close!  Me: 11.  SC: Well, I was here last night at 10:53, and you were closed! I rushed to get here, and you were closed!  Me: I'm sorry, Ma'am! I didn't get a lunch yesterday, so I had to close early. If I didn't, I would get written up!  SC: I told you I don't care about that! I rushed to get here, and you were closed! Let me talk to a manager!  Me: Ma'am, you have to go inside to talk to a manager. There's no one else in here.  SC: (staring incredulously) You're telling me you don't have a manager?!  Me: Not out here, Ma'am. We're a part of the bigger store, so they stay up there.  SC: Fine! I'm going there anyway! I'll just tell him about this, and he'll handle this.   I look around the parking lot and realize the manager has left for the day. I smile big and wish her a Happy 4th of July!   LoL! Wouldn't that make me accessory to a crime?   LoL! That is a good thing!   At least they were thorough about it! LoL!   LoL! That's what I was thinking! I had completely forgot about hitting it!   LoL! Cameras are everywhere, but yeah, as long as they haven't fixed it by now! Also, I can't do that its against the sub rules! LoL!   That is stupid! I'm glad we didn't have to be as strict about it. I told my manager, it got turned off (suspended?), and it was over   That would be a horrible coincidence!   That's very true!  At least I'm in a bullet proof case, with a cell phone and a land phone!   Sorry should have put S.O.L., so you'd know that it was acronym! At work and a little out of it!   That's what my manager said! I'm still not sure if they fixed it, or if we're just sol  	17
 I'm sorry to hear that. Please read A Prayer For Owen Meany.    What is yours  charger called?   r/ImAlmostHomeless.    Thank you. I remember a friend telling me that this book was the author's memoir, but I don't care for authors, just books.    I bought a kindle, I use I read about 3 books on it.    It's okay. What is important is to know what you are reading as opposed to how you are reading.    You came to the internet, to a community tethered by individuals with one comment interest: reading; and you come here to complain without some personal insight? No one cares if you read or not. I will forget about you in 5 seconds, and so will everyone else in a few hours. I like it when people don't read. It makes my life easier.    Not sure which laws apply to you, but from a US standpoint, minors cannot not legally sign contracts with organizations, you need a guardian to sign you.    I'm still confused about the ending. So the book proceed to tell a story of a protagonist and how her life went to shit. First she was on an internship then started dating some ashole in medical school, then she goes crazy and gets sent the asylum.But I'm not sure why Joan was there at the end, and how she killed herself. Ending is confusing, anyone wish to explain?   Don't do it. Unless you are going to marry her, and she has blown you at least 300 times.    You must out on so many books. Least you're not a fool anymore.    What a bohemian.   /r/minamilism would love this.   Never been to those states, but I live in CA, and in summer it's about 95-100 degrees most of the time. The difference is CA is just hot  where as Japan is humid. You feel sticky and that is what makes you feel the hottest. I've  never used an umbrella  for the sun, before either but there's a first for everything.    I'm in Shinjuku and it's humid. People are using umbrellas- including myself- during the day time. It's so hot. And sporadic rain sometimes too. Not stormy, just hot.    This is exactly why I travel. Life is just too demanding. But when I travel, I just take clothes, phone, money, passport and a book. I return ready to read for the next few months, until I need another vacation.   Haven't read that one yet, but I finished A Prayer For Owen Meany about 2 years ago, and I still cannot forget the ending.    A Prayer For Owen Meany, by John Irving.   That books felt like a movie being played in front of me, every descriptive scene felt like I in the room, viewing from a 1 way mirror.    I wonder if this book will be the book I fall into.     Every book I read, influences my life. Whether for the good or bad.    Unfortunately you lack discipline, unless you have a mental stigma. There is no teaching this, as you will have to endeavor this yourself. My best advice is to travel, every new country I visit, my lust grows for reading. You just have to find your beat and follow the rhythm.    I never have sense of pride when reading, it's nothing to be proud of. Only when one finished the book, one senses a myriad of conflicting emotions such as mourning or blissfulness; pride never crosses my mind when reading.    I exchanged it two weeks ago, and I fly back to the Americas tomorrow.    I started reading when I was 17, but gave it up at 19 when University and work started to take my time away from me, as the internet did as well, but you know what made me read again? Not having access to the internet. As banal as that advice sounds it works. I am 19 currently studying abroad in Japan, and I have no access to the internet most of the time, but I took a book with me even though I don't have the habit, I still enjoy reading - this contradicts itself, but I take a book with me, in a case where I do actually read it. However, I find myself constantly at a coffee shop or park bench reading. It's so amazing when you don't have the internet in your ear, or worrying about Facebook. You really need to travel to get the urge in you again, that's how I see it. Or just cancel your internet to rekindle the connection, otherwise you're just going to go on the internet instead of picking up a book.    **:)**   Disgusting.    I hate these about 2 days ago, my stomach starting hurting, never again.   Also don't eat your kids, play with them.    Do you have a pair of other shoes? Those shoes don't match with your glares.    Usually when a person is mean, it's due to "projection". When an individual projects a certain attitude leads to many possible solutions; in this case, I'm using the internet as a way to vent my loneliness. I figured it out, but there is little I can do without continuing the vicious cycle. "I'm sorry" is an ideal apology, but I will do it again tomorrow, so what's the point? I'm just so lonely, I fsdafds;jkl a.fs   I put down my anime posters last year. It's just a life transition. It's like having a picture of barney on your wall. You used to like it, but now you can't like it anymore. You must like something more age appropriate or else people will think you're weird if you're not in the crowd; but since you are asking how to blend in- you're not ready to be a Bohemian.   I never had this mindset. As I am always trying new things, I never run of things to say, "why am I doing this?" As opposed to, "She's so fucking hot" and I work my ass off and try to conquer her heart. I live my life for love. I sacrifice everything for it.    hoarding is a psychological disorder, minamilism is a way of life. To me, minalism  is an art form, soley to please me. Minalism  and poverty aren't associated though. In my life, I have expensive shit, but little of it. I don't get myself off the shit that is worthless to me.    Too much water.    It's best not to help people who don't need it. Just smile and wave, and laugh about it later.       New one is: riretashiro    I remember a time I used to be stupid. Gosh, I was suppressed I didn't kill myself; I can't imagine how depressed and lonely you are.    mac retina pro 2014   No one is reading that.    Note 4.    TESLA.    /r/im14andthisisdeep   I just delete people who play games.    I stopped buying brand paper, I like kraft paper with bindings. Unfortunately I wasn't  going to pay shipping for them so I flew to Japan I buy 5.    In Japan too?   damn-it.    Little to none. I go to school, go to work, and go home. I travel for fun.    don't send me money   This isn't r/videogames.   	50
       It's well worth reading Chris Evans' various biographies. I've just finished #2, which covers the period where he was married to her.  Honestly, how it comes over is two people that loved each other very much but came to understand that they should no longer be married to each other. They remained close friends and have both since found other partners. Not all divorces end unhappily and not everything is about money.   Sure, I'll bite:  * Red Bull - moaning about leaving all year. Can't see them here in  2 years without a major shakeup (e.g. Audi) * Lotus - financial problems for years now. Clearly in trouble. * Force India - ditto (but, to be fair, doing quite well this year.) * Torro Rosso - why would RB keep a B team if they stop racing? * Sauber - poor results, really poor management and are clearly chasing pennies. Surprised they are still here, TBH.  There, and I've not even started barrel scraping yet...   Agreed.  We could use some of the ones still in use too :)   Rubbish idea.  Make them mandatory :)   It's overrated.   Good luck! The first year is tough (and for me at least, not that rewarding) but every day now brings a wonderful new experience!  Spent yesterday with child #2 at Beavers camp having a whale of a time and spent today with the whole family visiting at stately home, walking in the parkland and enjoying watching my elder daughter trying to count all of the books in the library in her head (she did pretty well too :) )  Life is full of cool stuff and I enjoy every minute sharing them with my kids. I'm sure you will too :)   Gods, that's terrifying!   Any more beans, Mr Taggart?   Same here, with similar times. Took longer to sort the stupid ADB driver than to actually install :-/   Came here for this. Left not disappointed.   Anyone spot Peter Prodromou at 50s in?  Want to remain anonymous? Top tip: don't wear overalls with your name on the back :-)  Still, seemed to do pretty well against the might of Fred on a rampage!   It looks to my eyes like he might have been cornering a bit fast for the weight of his load...   Laughing hard here. Awesome!   "Hi, yes we'll be glad to help. I'll just put you through to someone who will sort your issue"  clunk rrrrring!  "You hung up on me!"  "Wow, that seems unlikely. Ok, I'll just put you on hold while I check to see if we have a problem with the phones"  clunk rrrrring!  "Stop fucking hanging up on me!"  "Wow, I have no idea how that could possibly have happened. Let me see if anyone is available now to talk to you"  clunk rrrrring!  "I'd like to speak to your supervisor!"  "Sure, I'll just put you through..."  "Nooo! Don't you fucking dar...."  clunk  (Repeat until your phone goes flat :-)    Did you check the ratio before refusing?   Always, always check the ratios....   How quaint!   Hello, computer...   In the UK? Not so sure about that....   I'd be interested to know how enforceable they are, actually. After all, if your contract says "You are not allowed to make sandwiches for a competitor for 2 years" but the only thing you know how to do is make sandwiches, then the contract is effectively denying you your livelihood. In the US, the contract would probably win, but in the UK, it would not.  I guess it would be argued that all three of them (but especially Clarkson) /have/ done non-automotive related shows before and they could make a living doing something else for a couple of years, but I'd very much doubt it. On the other hand, if it meant Clarkson was forced to spend two years making more war documentaries, then I'm all for it :)   You do know that Hammond was cast through auditions?   Perhaps not quite at the same profile as these ones (after all, TG had been canned a few years earlier) but it was still a really big thing for a relative unknown to land.   He was once (by his own admission too!) but he's settled into a likeable, charismatic presenter who still has a little of his old edge about him. Noone could replace Clarkson, but I'm happy to give Evans a good shot at goal.   I for one welcome what's happening!  We've gone from one Top Gear which, let's be honest, was getting a little stale and could have done with a bit of a kick (even the presenters admitted that they had "done" everything now) to two Top Gears both of which will get a really good opportunity to do new things with a blank sheet of paper.  Sounds pretty good, if you ask me :)   32 bit Vegas 11 working fine here on 10162 64 bit, Dell Latitude laptop.   Yup, same here: http://i.imgur.com/m9LExde.png    This remains true: https://youtu.be/hKWmFWRVLlU t=6m5s   UK person here, finding it hard to get my head around the processes here.  In the UK when you fire someone, it's both serious and requires due process. It certainly can't be done overnight (at least, not for someone who has worked there for a decent length of time). If you did kick someone out of the door without due process, you'd better know where your lawyer lives...  You can also lay staff off for other reasons, most typically due to downsizing. This again requires due process and can't happen overnight for normally employed people. In general, the larger the organisation and the more people they intend to lay off, the longer and more complicated the process is.  An employee "let go" as part of downsizing would never refer to themselves as "fired" which would be reserve for people who had done something bad. They would typically refer to themselves being "made redundant".  No idea how long this has been brewing of course, but I do cringe at the US corporate-centric "hire em, fire em" ethos. Bloody glad I'm on the right side of the pond when it comes to employment law!   Here you go. Looks like your guess was spot on: http://singletrackworld.com/2015/07/martyn-ashton-rides-again/   No cynical or funny comments from me. That video was, quite simply, the most uplifting thing I've watched for a long, long time. The smile on his face was so utterly genuine that you can't help grinning while watching it  Interesting to watch the "making of" companion video. That first push off the top really was their first go and they weren't at all sure how it would go. Check their expressions and their absolute joy when they realised that it would actually bloody work.  Exceptional and inspiring. Awesome!   Heh, sorry mate :-)   The Ridge? Nah, Skye.   I like Cars, personally and my kids /love/ Cars. In fact, if pushed, they'd probably rate it their favourite Pixar film. I've never understood why people (read:adults) look down on it so much. It's a clever concept, well executed with a good storyline. Which of us doesn't enjoy (at least in secret!) watching McQueen come to the realisation that Old Doc is actually the famous Hudson Hornet!?  That said, many animation studios would love to make a feature that is nearly as good as Pixar's worst. That's a track record they can be proud of!  Did Pixar make Planes? Now /that/ was bloody terrible :-/  	33
    First, what do you mean by power? And how can we compare the power of both?   I used the Toshiba CB2 FHD this past semester for my OOP Java and OOP C++ classes and it worked out ok for me. Eclipse was a bit laggy, but I usually found myself working in Sublime Text 3.  This summer I've been using it to program in Python (using IPython notebooks) and R (using RStudio) and it has been working well for me.  My main issue is the limited on board storage, even though I've got a 64GB sd which does help a bit, I would have loved to have had 32GB in onboard storage vs the 16GB .  Oh I'm running elementaryOS Luna (Ubuntu 12.04) via crouton.   You could also use [chrome magic actions](http://www.chromeactions.com/) and enable MP4/AVC.  That should get rid of the stutter, plus you get a bunch of other useful features.   [Here is the link to the study.](http://archpsyc.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=2319711)   It wasn't just the media.  Main push actually came from the players.  If the NBA didn't do anything there was a good chance the players would protest and not play.   Do you have any reading suggestions that do a good job blending theory and practice? I'm starting my summer break so I would love to do at least one summer project involving computer vision (and motion/speed tracking).    Everything works well if you have the right extensions set up.  I made a thread regarding fixing some of the stuttering for Youtube videos here: https://pay.reddit.com/r/chromeos/comments/34p7ru/fix_for_youtube_60fps_stuttering/  Check it out it you are interested.  I've been using since about the end of November and it has done everything I've needed it to do.  I installed a linux distro to use for my programming course this semester.  It's been fine running everything I need.  I've only had some lag issues with one of IDE's (Eclipse) I've used in class.  The main complaint I have is that the build quality is not good.  The two corner screws under the laptop, by the screen, are gone.  They would constantly become unscrewed. I lost the first two that came with the laptop and two others that I replaced them with.  So now I just don't even bother.    But that screen.  Can't find a laptop with a better screen at this price.  Just a heads there can be some color shifting when viewing it from certain angles, like from the top left or top right.  Looking at the screen directly from the left or right doesn't really cause any serious color shifting.   Should have been a tech and Bulls ball: http://www.nba.com/analysis/rules_12.html?nav=ArticleList   How about this: https://automatetheboringstuff.com/   FGM seems to be a problem in that part of the world.   Check out the data from unicef: http://data.unicef.org/child-protection/fgmc   Does anyone have data for other parts of the world?   The youtube stream also allowed for easy chromecast playback.   O'Reilly has put up [these](https://beta.oreilly.com/learning) interactive tutorials if anyone is interested.  They seem pretty interesting.   Silicon Valley      Not sure if this will help as it pertains to hiring scientists, but maybe you can get some ideas from it: http://treycausey.com/hiring_data_scientists.html   It may not be as speculative, but it is just as petty.  As much as we all love football, it's still an entertainment business.  Both TMZ and Schefter both report information regarding the entertainment world, it's just that TMZ reports on a wider variety of entertainment businesses while Schefter focuses on the NFL.   I was using Magic Actions to force flash player on youtube, that resolved most of the stuttering.  Thanks for the tip about turning MP4/AVC on, I'll check it out.   I don't have any issues with Netflix.  	19

That was real. However well thought out and logical policy changes are, when applied in such a sudden, sweeping and inconsiderate way it will make employees unhappy. If they're talented with sought out skills then they will leave for a place where they can happily pursue their career goals. People will call it selfish or entitled but to me that's life.   Eh. It's not so black and white. It's a good portrayal of chasm that sometimes exists between management and employees. The employees don't take the larger picture into account. The management just sees them as numbers and not actually people with thoughts and emotions.         I liked Harmony better than Genocidal Organ. It handled heavy exposition in a better and more palatable way. Harmony's MC was also more personable which made her easier to get attached to. Both novels are soul-crushers.            Watched Despicable Me 2 and The Book of Life.  Despicable Me 2 was adorable and funny. Steve Carell voice acting was on point. It also looked great for its relatively modest budget of $76 million.  The Book of Life didn't appeal to me. The marionettes art style didn't look good. The love triangle was very one-sided.

The anime is a major way for Bandai to market the game prior to release. It being delayed to the fall season will severely limit their marketing. ~~It also makes me wonder why Bandai didn't choose Sunrise to do God Eater since they own that studio. They probably thought Ufotable's style was a better fit but I bet some of them are thinking right now that they should've went with Sunrise.~~ Forgot that Ufotable worked on the God Eater games and a bunch of Bandai games and that's why they were hired.   Doubt it. Ufotable strikes me as a studio that would only take projects with a good budget to maintain their high standard of art and animation. They just don't seem to have much experience with juggling multiple series since they usually only make one per year. I'm guessing that inexperience with schedule constraints is what causing the production problems.      Digital Frontier is doing the CG. They did the CG for Resident Evil: Damnation. They also did the CG sections in Wolf Children including the [snow scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YGWzwpVBZSE)  Resident Evil: Damnation action scenes:  [Ada Wong VS Svetlana](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzPdR1bRtBw)  [Tyrant fight](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LH_JcpyoVho)  Those looked pretty good to me but then again anime series production compared to film production is a different story in terms of budget and time management. That difference being budget and time are more constrained in TV anime production.  To me the more interesting part of this announcement is Digital Frontier possibly doing more CG anime series production. A competition between them and Polygon is good for advancing the tech in CG anime.      I would totally watch a spin-off with Knuckle and his [percussion harem](http://i.imgur.com/wMn20CC.jpg).

Solid 2nd season but not as good as the first which had more tension and better sense of eminent danger. I also would have liked if we got information on the gaunas; their origin and why they're attacking humans. Some details on Ochiai's use of gauna biology to make his come back would've been nice too.  As for the finale, the continuation of the battle was a bit underwhelming compared to the last episode. Maybe the finale would have been better off as being purely a resolution episode. That would also mean condensing all the battle in the 11th episode, which I would not have liked.  The orbital bombardment sequence was absolutely badass and the sound design was glorious.  [Bombardment sequence](https://streamable.com/1c19)       Dunno. The disk sales per volume are down by 2,000 from the first season. If the producers don't want to do a third season maybe netflix will pick it up since they'll be launching in Japan soon and might want some new content for that audience.   Haha.

 Its a long story, but one youve never heard before. A story is about a place that dwells in the woods, on the mountain; a place where bad things happen. And you may think you know about the bad things, you may decide you have it all figured out but you dont. Because the truth is worse than monsters and men.  At first I was upset I was when I they told me we were moving to some little town out in the Ozarks. I remember staring at my dinner plate while I listened to my sister throw a temper tantrum unbefitting of a 14 year old honors student.  She cried, she pleaded, and then she cursed at my parents. She threw a bowl at my dad and told him it was all his fault. Mom told Whitney to calm down but she stormed off, slamming every door in the house on the way to her room.   I secretly blamed my dad as well. Id heard the whispers too, my dad had done something wrong, something bad and the sheriffs department had reassigned him to some little out of the way county to save face. My parents didnt want me to know that, but I did.   I was nine so it didnt take me too long to warm to the idea of a change; it was  like an adventure. New house! New school! New friends! Whitney, of course, felt the opposite. Moving to a new school at her age is hard, moving away from her new boyfriend, however, was even harder.  While the rest of us packed up our things and said our goodbyes, Whitney sulked and cried and threatened to run away from home. But a month later when we pulled up to our new house in Drisking, Missouri she was sitting right next me texting viciously on her phone.   Thankfully, we moved over the summer and I had months of free time to explore the town. When Dad started his new job at the sheriffs office, Mom drove us around the city commenting on this and that. The city was much, much smaller than St. Louis but also a lot nicer. There were no bad areas and the entire town looked like something youd see on a post card. Drisking was built in a mountain valley surrounded by healthy forest land with walking trails and crystal clear lakes. I was 9, it was summer and this was in heaven.   Wed only been living in Drisking a week or so when our next door neighbors came to introduce themselves: Mr. and Mrs. Landy and their 10 year old son Kyle. While our parents talked and drank mimosas, I watched the Landys lanky, red-headed son hung out in the doorway, shyly eyeing the PS3 in the living room.   Uh, do you play? I asked.  He shrugged. Not really.  Do you wanna? I just got Call of Duty 4.  Um Kyle glanced at his mom, who had just been handed her third mimosa.  Yeah. Sure.  And that afternoon, with the ease and simplicity of our age, Kyle and I became best friends. We spent the cool summer mornings outside exploring the Ozarks and the hot afternoons in my living room playing the PS3. He introduced me to the only other kid in the neighborhood our age: a skinny, quiet girl named Kimber Destaro.  She was shy but friendly and always up for anything. Kimber kept up with us so well that she quickly became the third wheel on our tricycle.   With my dad at work all the time, my mom consumed with her new friendships and my sister locked in her room all day, the summer was ours to take and take it we did. Kyle and Kimber showed me where all the best hiking trails were, which lakes were the best (and most accessible by bike), and where the best stores were in town. By the time the first day of school rolled around in September I knew I was home.  On the last Saturday before school started, Kyle and Kimber told me they were going to take me somewhere special, somewhere we hadnt been yet  the Triple Tree.   Whats a triple tree? I asked.  Its a totally awesome, totally huge treehouse out in the woods. Kyle said excitedly.  Pfft, whatever, Kyle. Come on, you guys, if there was a freakin treehouse you would have showed it to me already.  Na-uh, we wouldntve, Kyle shook his head. Theres a ceremony for first-timers and everything.  Kimber nodded eagerly in agreement, her dark orange curls bouncing off of her tiny shoulders. Yep, its true Sam. If you enter the treehouse without the proper ceremony youll disappear and then youll die.  My face fell. Now I knew they were making fun of me. Thats a lie! You guys are lying to me!   No were not! Kimber insisted.  Yeah, well show you! We just have to get a knife for the ceremony and well go.  What? Why do you need a knife? Is it a blood ceremony? I whispered.  No way! Kimber promised.  You just say some words and carve your name into the Triple Tree.  Yup, it takes like one minute. Kyle agreed.  And its a really cool treehouse? I asked.  Oh yeah. Kyle promised.  Okay, I guess Ill do it then.  Kyle insisted on using the same knife he used during his own ceremony but we paid a price to get it. Mrs. Landy just happened to be home with her youngest son Parker and despite Kyles many objections his mother insisted he take his six year old brother with him.  Mom, were going to the treehouse, its only for older kids. Parker cant go!  I dont care if youre going to see an Exorcist movie marathon, youre taking your brother with you. I need a break, Kyle, cant you understand that? And Im sure your friends wont mind. She flashed Kimber and me a challenging look. Right?  No, not at all, Kimber said and I nodded in agreement.  Kyle made a loud, dramatic sigh and called his brother. Parker, put your shoes on, were leaving now!  Id met the youngest Landy several times before and found that he was as unlike his older brother in looks as in disposition.  Where Kyle was a wild, excitable fireball with hair to match, I found Parker to be an anxious, fidgety boy with small  eyes and dark brown hair.   We got on our bikes and made our way to a lesser known hiking trail a few miles away. Id asked before where the trail led when wed ridden across it several weeks before and Kyle had given me the underwhelming answer of nowhere interesting.   We pulled up to trail head and leaned our bikes against the wooden sign post which read West Rim Prescott Ore Trail.   Why are so many trails around here named Prescott? I asked. Is this Prescott Mountain or something?  Kimber laughed. No, dummy, its because of *the* Prescotts. You know, the family that lives in the mansion up on Fairmont. Mr. Prescott and his son Jimmy own like half the businesses in town.  *More* than half, Kyle agreed.   Which ones? Does he own the Game Stop? The only store in Drisking I really cared about.  I dont know about that one, Kyle wound a lock around the 4 bikes and clicked the bar into place, then spun the numbers on the dial. But like the hardware store, the pharmacy, Glitons on 2nd and the newspaper.  Did they start this town? I asked.  Nah, mining started the town. I think they-  I want to go home. Parker had been so quiet Id completely forgotten he was there.   You cant go home, Kyle rolled his eyes. Mom said I had to bring you. Now come on, its only like a two mile walk.  I wanna take my bike. Parker answered.  Too bad, were going off trail.  I dont wanna go. Ill stay with the bikes.  Dont be such a wussy.  Im not!  Kyle, be nice! Kimber hissed. Hes only 5.  Im 6! Parker objected.  Im sorry, 6. Youre 6. Kimber smiled at him.  Alright fine, he can hold your hand if he wants. But hes coming. Kyle turned and started up the trail.   Parker face fell into an undignified frown but when the charming Kimber stuck her hand out and wiggled her fingers at him, he took it.   Kyle was right, it wasnt a long walk  only a half mile down the trail and then another half mile hike on a well tread path up the mountain. It was a steep climb though, and by the time we got to the treehouse, I was winded.  What do you think? Kyle asked, excitedly.  Its I studied the tree as I caught my breath. Its pretty awesome, I smiled.  And it was. They hadnt lied, the treehouse was the biggest Id ever seen. It had multiple rooms and there were actual curtains in the windows. A sign above the door said Ambercot Fort and a rope ladder hung below the threshold, missing several planks.   Im going up first! Yelled Parker, but Kimber caught his arm.   You have to do the ceremony first or youll disappear. She reminded him.  Thatd be fine with me, Kyle grumbled.   I was eager to get into the fort myself.  Give me the knife. I held out my hand. Kyle smiled and dug the switchblade out  of his pocket.   Theres some space in the back to carve your name.  I opened up the knife walked around the tree looking for an empty spot. They were so many names on the tree that I had to crunch down and look near the bottom since I couldnt reach any higher. I spotted both Kyle and Kimbers carvings on the tree and I finally found a spot I liked near the latter. I bit my tongue and carved *Sam W.* into a blank piece of bark underneath someone named Paul S. Parker  went next but had so much trouble with the knife that  Kyle had to do it for him.    Alright, lets go, I ran over to the rope ladder.  Wait! Kyle yelled. You have to say the words first.  Oh yeah. Okay what are they?  Kimber sang them out. Underneath the Triple Tree there is a man who waits for  me and should I go or should I stay my fates the same either way.  Thatscreepy. I said.  What does it mean?  Kimber shrugged. No one knows anymore, its just tradition.  Okay, can you say it one more time, slower?  Once Parker and I had recited the poem we were ready to go. I climbed the rope  ladder first and took stock of my new surroundings. The treehouse was more or less empty, just a dirty rug here and there and some trash: old soda cans, beer cans and fast food wrappers.   I went room to room  four in total  and found nothing of real interest until the last one. An old mattress lay in the corner and piles of musty, ripped clothing scattered the floor.  Did a hobo live here? I asked.   Nah, this room has been like this for as long as I can remember. Kyle said from  the doorway behind me.  It smells gross. I said.  Kimber walked up to the threshold but refused to go any further. Its not the  smell that freaks me out - its that. She pointed up to the ceiling and I raised my eyes to read what was written there.  **Road to the Gates of Hell**                                                                                                                                          **Mile Marker 1**  What does it mean? I asked.  Its just older kids being dicks, Kyle said. Come on, Ill show you the best part of the treehouse.  We walked back into the first room and Parker looked up at us and smiled, pointing down to what hed clumsily carved into the wooden floor.   Fart, Kyle read. Thats hilarious, Parker. He rolled his eyes but his little brother didnt pick up on the sarcasm and smiled proudly.  Kimber sat down on the floor next to Parker and I sat on his other side. Kyle took the knife from his brother and then walked across the room and wedged the blade between two planks of the wooded wall. He pushed and the board gave, opening up a small, secret compartment in the wall. Kyle took something out and pushed the plank back in until it was flush with the others.  Check it out. He turned around and proudly held up two cans of Miller Lite beer.  Whoa! I said.  Ewww, warm beer? Thats gross. How did you even know it was there? Kimber asked.  Phil Saunders told me.  Are we gonna drink it? I asked.  Hell yeah were gonna drink it!  Kyle came and sat down in our circle, popped open the first beer and offered it to Kimber. She eyed it like he was trying to hand her a dirty diaper.  Come on, Kimmy.  Dont call me that! She yelled at him and then reluctantly took the open beer. She smelled it and made a face, then pinched her nose and took a small swig. Kimber shuddered. That was even grosser than I imagined.  I dont want any! Ill tell mom! Parker said quickly as the beer passed in front of him to me.  Good, cause you aint getting any, Kyle promised. And you wont tell mom shit.  I put on my best poker face and took a long, deep swallow of the warm beer before I had the chance to smell it. It was a poor decision and when I wretched, the foul yellow liquid went all over my shirt.  Aww man, now Im gonna smell like beer.  We spent the next hour and a half drinking the two cans of Miller Lite and after awhile the taste grew more tolerable. I couldnt tell if I was becoming a man or actually getting drunk. I hoped it was the former. When the last drop of the last beer was consumed we spent 20 minutes trying to determine if we were drunk.  Kyle assured us that he was wasted while Kimber wasnt sure. I didnt think I was, but I failed all of our drunk tests.   Kimber was in the middle of reciting the alphabet backwards when a loud, metallic grinding suddenly pierced the calm mountain air like a gunshot. Kimber stopped talking and we spent a few minutes staring at each other, waiting for the noise to end. Parker curled into Kimber and put his hands over his ears. After what seemed like ten whole minutes the sound ended as suddenly as it had begun.   What *was* that? I asked and Parker mumbled something into Kimbers sweatshirt.   Do you guys know? I tried again.  Kimber stared at her feet as she crossed and uncrossed them.  Well?  Its nothing, Kyle answered finally. We hear it sometimes in town; its not a big deal. Its just louder up here.  But whats making that sound?  Borrasca. Kimber whispered without taking her eyes off her feet.  Whos that? I asked.  Not who, where. Kyle answered. Its a place.  Another town?  No, its just a place in the woods.  Oh.  Bad things happen there, Kimber said more to herself that me.  Like what?   Bad things. Kimber repeated.   Yeah, dont ever try to find it, dude. Kyle said behind me. Or bad things will happen to you, too.  But like, what bad things? I turned around. Kyle shrugged and Kimber stood up and walked over to the rope ladder.  Wed better go. I have to get home to my mom, she said.   We climbed down the ladder one by one and then started the walk back to the trail head in an unfamiliar silence. I was dying of curiosity about Borrasca but couldnt decide if and what to ask about it.   So, who lives there?  Where? Kyle asked.  Borrasca.  The Skinned Men, Parker answered.  Pfft, Kyle laughed. Only babies believe that.  Like men who are skinned? Like their skin is gone? I asked excitedly.  Yeah, thats what some kids say. Most of us stop believing in that, though, when we turn double digits. Kyle said.  I looked back at Kimber who was still nine like me but she was staring down the trail, ignoring us. That seemed to be the end of the conversation and by the time we reached our bikes the awkwardness was gone and we were giggling trying to decide if we were too drunk to bike home.  School started two days later and Id completely forgotten about Borrasca. When my dad pulled up to the curb to drop me off that morning he locked the doors before I could get out.   Not so fast, he laughed. As your father I get the privilege of giving you a hug and telling you to have a good first day of school.  But Dad, I gotta go meet Kyle by the flag before first bell!  And you will, but give me a hug first. In a few years youll be driving yourself to  school, let me be your dad while I still can.  Fine. I said, exacerbated, and leaned over to give my dad a quick hug.  Thank you. Now go meet your friend. Your mom will be waiting here to pick you up at 3:40.  I *know*, Dad. Why cant I take the bus like Whitney?  When youre 12, you can take the bus. He smiled and unlocked the doors. Until then, I get to drop you off in the mornings. If you think itd make you look cooler you can ride in the back seat behind the cage.  Dadjust dont. I threw open the door of his cruiser before he could say anything more and ran as he laughed behind me.  Kyle was already waiting for me at the flag pole and hed found Kimber, too.  Dude, you almost missed the bell! He yelled when he saw me.  I know, sorry.  Whose class are you in? Kimber asked. She was wearing a red sweater and leggings with frogs on them. Her curly orange hair was brushed into ringlets and her lips were pink and shiny. Shed never looked prettier and I was surprised to realize Id never really seen Kimber as a girl.   Ah, Mr. Diamonds.  Me too! She said cheerfully.  Lucky, Kyle scoffed. Im in Mrs. Tverdys. Only two 4th grade teachers and I get the crappy one.  Kimber grimaced. Yeah, my mom had her when she was a kid.   Whats wrong with her? What did she say?  Just that shes strict and gives out homework on the weekends.  On the *weekends*? Fuck!  Excuse me, Mr. Landy? I immediately recognized the tall man that had suddenly appeared behind the white-faced Kyle.  So-Sorry, sir. I meant dang.  Kimber giggled.  Im sure you did. He nodded.  Hi, Sheriff Clery. Even though Id only met him a few times I liked my dads boss and he liked me.  Well hello, Sammy, are you excited for your first day? Sheriff Clery crossed his arms in front of him and widened his stance imposingly, but gave me a wide smile.  Yes sir! I said. And then added lamely, What are you doing here?  Im giving a presentation to the 5th and 6th grades about safety when walking to and from school.  Yeah, he gives it every year. Kyle muttered.  Cool, I smiled.   Sheriff Clery nodded at me and then turned and walked away. I looked around, confused. Wheres Kimber?  She took off. She is annoyingly on time to everything. And as if to illustrate his point, the bell rang. We both ran up the stairs and inside.   I walked into class and saw that Kimber had saved me a spot next to her at the back. Mr. Diamond, a short, round man of 40 or so nodded at me when I came in.   Mr. Walker, I presume?  Um, yeah, thats me. I mumbled as I rushed past him to the desk next to Kimber.  Welcome to Drisking Elementary. And for the rest of you, welcome back. Go Grizzlies!  The class echoed a reluctant and subdued go grizzlies.   Kimber introduced me to other kids in the class throughout the morning. Most of them were nice, if sort of underwhelmed by me. They said their hellos and asked where I was from and the conversations usually ended with an unimpressed okay.  A group of girls who sat near the front, snuck looks at us all morning and snickered. I asked Kimber who they were and she just shrugged. During our second break they came up and talked to me.  Are you friends with Kimber Destaro? A tall, dark-haired girl asked me.  Yeah, I answered and looked over at Kimber. She was watching me with worried eyes.  Are you related to her?  No.  I didnt think so because you dont have orange hair. I didnt know what to say to that.  You dont have to be friends with her, you know, said the second girl with the oddly round face.   I wanna be friends with her.  A third girl behind the other two snorted. She had pretty auburn hair and a rude, upturned nose.  Well, if you do youre going to be in the ugly kid group, the first girl warned.  And once youre in that group you cant leave it ever.  Better than the bitch group. I said. Rude Nose and Round Face gasped but Dark Hair smiled.   Well see, she said and the three returned to their corner of the room. I sat back down next to Kimber feeling like a badass. It was the first time Id ever used a swear word in front of anybody other than Kyle.   What did they say to you? Kimber asked, nervously.  They said youre too pretty to be near them and that you make them look gross so we have to stay away from them.  Liar, Kimber answered, but I could tell she was smiling.  We met Kyle in the cafeteria at lunch and he had nothing but bad things to say about his morning. Mrs. Tverdy was old and mean and she made everyone come up and say something about themselves even though the class only had 14 kids and they all knew each other. When the bell rang for recess I went to throw my lunch away with Kyle and I bumped into a kid I hadnt seen before.  Hey, are you Sam Walker? The kid asked.  Yeah.  Oh. Your sister is dating my brother.  Oh man! Kyle laughed. Your sister is dating a Whitiger!  Shut up, Kyle. The kid grumbled.  Shes gonna be Whitney Whitiger!  As funny as it was I couldnt help but be a little surprised. Not that Id been paying attention but Id only seen Whitney out of her room once over the summer.   Um, where did she meet him? I asked the Whitiger kid.  I dunno. Probably at his job.  His job where?  He works at Drisking Water.  It didnt make any sense to me but I shrugged it off. I did remember my mom giving Whitney some menial tasks like getting the car washed and setting up some utilities to get her out of the house. Maybe she met him once and they started dating over text. Teenagers were weird.  The rest of the school week followed much like the first. We were well into the first month when I heard someone mention the Skinned Men again. We were out on the playground and Kyle and I were trying to start a fire with two large wood chips. Id just given myself a splinter when the distant sound of metal grinding on metal flooded over the playground, silencing every one of us.  Borrasca, I said in awe.  Yep, said Phil Saunders. The Skinned Men kill again.  Hey, Kyle said only babies believed in Skinned Men! I threw an accusatory look at Kyle.  They do! Phil is just stupid.  Am not! Ask Danielle, shes seem then. Phil scanned the playground and then yelled at a blonde girl talking to Rude Nose. Hey Danielle come here!  The blonde girl rolled her eyes but came skipping over anyway. What do you want? I told you Kayla doesnt like you, Phillip.  No, tell them about the Skinned Men. Phil gestured to the air around us which was filled with the metallic scraping coming down from the mountain.  *You* tell them.  No, you saw them so you tell them.  *I* didnt see them, Paige saw them.  Oh. Phil said and an uncomfortable silence descended.   You guys are weird, Danielle said before flipping her hair in our faces and  leaving.  Whos Paige? I asked when shed gone.  Her sister, Phil said.   Paige disappeared when we were like 5. Kyle said.  After she saw the Skinned Men, Phil added.  The sounds from the mountain abruptly ended and the subdued atmosphere of the playground disappeared with it. When the bell rang Kyle lined up in his class line and since Phil was in my class I made sure I was behind him. The teachers began to count us off.  Hey, what else do you know about Borrasca? I whispered to him.  My brother said thats where people go when they disappear. To Borrasca.  What happens to them there?  Bad things, he said, and then shushed me when I asked him what that meant.  The year dragged on and it wasnt until Christmas break that I heard the machine at Borrasca again. It was December and there was a thick blanket of snow on the ground which only served to amplify the noise from the mountain. I sat in my room listening to it for a few minutes trying to decide what was happening in the place that bad things happen. I saw my dads cruiser pull up out the window and went down stairs to greet him. As I passed my sisters door I heard her giggling in that annoying, teenage girl way and I cringed. I hoped Kimber never got like that.   Dad! I skidded on the landing just as he opened the door. My dad stomped the snow off his boots and threw open his arms.  Sammy! How many years has it been? He joked.  It was true I hadnt seen much of my dad lately since he was working so much.  Doing what, I didnt know since this was the quietest, lamest town ever. Mom thought the Sheriff was grooming dad for his job since Clery was so old and Dad never really agreed or disagreed with her. Hed only been at the department seven months, after all, and he doubted people in the county would vote for him.   Hey Dad, do you hear that? That like machine-sounding noise?  Yep! I hear it in town every now and then.  Do you know what it is?  I asked the Sheriff about it and he told me the noise comes from private property up in the Ozarks.  Is the property called Borrasca? I asked quickly.  I have no idea. Borrasca? Whered you hear that?  I shrugged. Kids at my school.  Well, its nothing to worry about, Sammy, probably just some logging equipment.  But is the place called Borrasca? Like have you heard that name before?  No, I have not heard that before. Dad pulled his boots off and shrugged off his coat, looking toward the kitchen. I could tell I was losing him.   Have you ever heard of the Skinned Men? I asked quickly.  *Skinned* Men? Good god, Sam. Is your sister telling you these stories?  No. But he wasnt listening to me anymore.  Whitney! He yelled up the stairs.  No, Dad, Whitney doesnt even talk to me. I repeated.  I heard a door creak open upstairs and Whitney peered over the railing, phone in  hand and an annoyed look on her face  Are you trying to scare your brother? Dad demanded.  Dad, no. I said again.  Whitney shot me a betrayed look. Ugh, seriously? As if Id waste my time.  You arent telling him stories about Skinned Men?  No, Dad, I told you I heard it at school, I said.  Whitney gestured to me as if to say see?  Alright, well you kids need to start getting along. Youre family for Christs sake. Whitney rolled her eyes and when Dad walked into the kitchen she stuck her tongue out at me.  Real mature, Whitney! I yelled up at her but she was already gone. Ill tell Dad about your boyfriend!  Christmas came and went with surprising smoothness at our house. Whitney and I got everything wed had on our lists, which was a first for us. The town may be smaller but Dads paychecks were clearly better.   I wore my new Rams parka on the first day back to school after Christmas break. Kyle fawned over it and Kimber showed off the blue pearl necklace her mom had gotten her for Christmas. Kyle and I feigned interest but did it poorly. Kimber knew, but just seemed happy we cared enough to fake it.   As we said goodbye to Kyle for the morning Kimber was suddenly slammed from the side. Kyle caught her before she fell and I spun around angrily to see Dark-Haired Girl  whose name Id learned was Phoebe Dranger  laughing and walking away from us with Round-Face girl.   Youre bad people who make poor life choices! Kyle yelled at them. When Im your boss someday Ill make you clean bathrooms!  Yeah, and if Kyles your boss, you *know* you messed up! I added. Kyle and I high-fived and turned to Kimber but she wasnt sharing in our victory  she was trying to hide the tears on her face.  Dont sweat those girls, Kimber, nobody likes them. People are just nice to them because theyre related to the Prescotts. Kyle tried to give her an awkward pat on the back but Kimber turned away from him and ran in the opposite direction.   I hate those girls. Like I really hate them. I said.  I know, theyre bitches. Kyle answered, mouthing the last word as he looked over his shoulder for any lurking adults.  Well, Id better get to class and make sure they dont try and talk to her again.  Theres an assembly this morning. No class until after lunch.  Seriously? Thats awesome! Do we have to sit by class?  Not usually but we better get there quick so we can get seats at the back. Kyle said as we started walking.  Whats the assembly for? I asked.  Its either D.A.R.E. or the History Society presentation.  Whats D.A.R.E.?  You know, D.A.R.E.? As in dont you dare do drugs or youre grounded until youre dead?  Oh. I hope its the history thing then.  We found Kimber already in the auditorium. She had collected herself and saved us both seats at the back of the room. She waved us over just as the puffy, stern Mrs. Tverdy walked onto the stage.  Hello 4th Grade students. This morning we have a special presentation for you from the Historic Preservation Society of Drisking. If you have questions during the course of the lecture, please raise your hand.  Like *thatll* happen, Kyle laughed.  Now, Id like to introduce to you Mr. Wyatt Dowding, Ms. Kathryn Scanlon and of course, Mr. James Prescott.  What! Jimmy Prescott and not his dad? Thats so weird! Kimber whispered.  Dude, Thomas Prescott has done this presentation every year for like 20 years, Kyle said. Its definitely weird.  Its not weird, whispered Mike Sutton from behind us. He leaned forward. Tom Prescott went crazy like a year ago. He didnt do the presentation last year when my sister was here either.  I dont like Jimmy Prescott, Kimber shook her head. He gives me the heeby-jeebies. His dad is so much nicer, hes like a grandpa.  The presentation was slow and boring. Mr. Dowding and Ms. Scanlon talked about the first settlers here: the Cherokee and the trail of tears. They talked about Alexander Driskings discovery of a motherlode of ore in the mountains and settling here with his family to mine and refine the iron.  Then James Prescott took the stage from there to tell the story of his familys early journey to the town and their role in the revitalization of Drisking itself in the late 50s.   The last part was the most interesting of it all and I found Jimmy Prescott to be infallibly charismatic and entertaining. I was so busy laughing at his jokes and hanging on his every word that by the end of his presentation I realized Id actually learned quite a bit. So much so that I was interested enough to ask a question, which Kyle warned was committing social suicide.  Mr. Prescott scanned the room and answered a few other questions before he finally got to me at the back.  Yes, you in the back.  Um, Mr. Prescott, why did the mines close? Like, what happened? I asked.  Very good question, young man. What did you say your name was?  AhSam. Walker.  Ah, I believe I met your father the other day at the Sheriffs office. Welcome to Drisking! As for your questions, most of the mines were closed in 1951 after a long period of unprofitability: the mountain had simply ran out of iron ore. The mills and refineries were abandoned and the town suffered for years. The miners and their families moved away, stores went out of business, schools closed and Drisking became a ghost town.  That would have been the end of it if it werent for stubborn families like mine who refused to leave. We refused to give up the town and after many, many years of hard work Drisking became the picturesque little haven in the Ozarks that it is today. I hope that answers your question.  I sat back down and Kyle shook his head at me. Bro  The assembly suffered through another fifteen minutes of awkward Q and A until Mrs. Tverdy finally cut us loose. We were released into the cafeteria to wait for the lunch lines to open. Kyle, Kimber and I sat in our usual corner.   That was soooo boring, Kyle whined. When are they going to figure out that *no one* cares about Driskings history? Seriously, I fell asleep like three times.  Kimber nudged me. Sam seemed to care, she teased.  I just wanted to know about the mines. Mines are creepy, thats all.  Yeah, but all our mines were blown up. You cant go in them anymore. Kyle said.  Blown up? I asked.  Kimber nodded. Some kids died after going into the mines so the city set off some controlled blasts to implode the caverns, at least thats what my mom said. They messed up, though, and I heard they blew up the water table or poisoned it or something.  What, how do you know that? Kyle asked.  Kimber shrugged. I heard my dad talking about it.  Did they use C4 or something?  I guess.  So like, we all drink the water so we all have C4 in our bodies and we could explode at any minute! Kyle said excitedly.  Do you think thats what happened to all the missing people? I asked him. Just sitting there one day and BOOM!   Yeah, dude, Kyle grabbed my shoulders. And thats where the Skinned Men come from.  I made the international symbol of mind blown and we laughed hysterically.  You guys are dumb, Kimber rolled her eyes but then she laughed when Kyle fell on the floor pretending he was exploding. I remember thinking in that moment that I was happy here in Drisking, Missouri with these two people. Happier than Id ever been anywhere else.   It was the last truly happy moment I ever had. Less than an hour later Mr. Diamonds phone rang and he exchanged a few quiet words with the person on the other end, his eyes flicking to and from my desk. It was hard to be surprised, then, when he hung up and asked me to come up to the front.  When I got there he told me my mom was waiting for me in the office and I was going home for the day. I traded a confused and worried look with Kimber and then packed up my backpack and went to the office. When I got there, my mom was crying.  We drove home in strained silence. I was too afraid to ask what was wrong. Mom parked the car a block from our house, which was blocked in by several police cars. When an explanation didnt come I broke the silence myself.  Is it dad? I asked quietly, holding back tears.  No, honey, Dad is fine, she whispered.  Then what happened?  Whitney never made it to school this morning, her voice broke over my sisters name.   Oh, no Mom, I think she ditched! I said quickly. I saw her leave this morning and it was really early, like 6, and she was with her friends. Um, Pete Witiger and that kid Taylor!  We know about all that, Sam. But they made it to school and Whitney wasnt with them. They said she wanted to stop by the Circle K near Drisking High so they left her there. And no one has seen her since.  Well My brain struggled to come up with an explanation. Maybe shes ditching.  No, honey. My mom put the car back in drive and drove up to our house, parking behind a police cruiser. The police, as well as your father, think that Whitney is with Jay.  But she has a new boyfriend here!"  We found all her books on the floor of her room this morning and half her clothes gone along with some cash of your dads.  But-  Right now we think that she hitched a ride to St. Louis and that shes with Jay. The Sheriffs office is trying to contact the boys parents now.  *Whitney?* *Run away?* Anyone who knew my sister knew she was prone to dramatics and empty threats. Plus, she was dating Chris Witigers older brother Pete. I was sure of it.  We walked up the steps and into a house filled with stale coffee and quiet murmurs. I tried to remember if Whitney herself had ever actually confirmed she was dating Pete but I drew a blank. When we walked into the kitchen, I saw my father sitting at the table, staring at phone records, head in hand. He looked up when I came into the room and gave me a weak smile.  Hey, buddy.  Dad, I have to tell you something.  I felt a heavy hand on my shoulder and turned to look up at a solemn Sheriff Clery.  Everything and anything you might know, son. No matter how trivial you think it is.  I nodded and sat down at the table with my dad as my mom handed the big man a cup of coffee.  Here you go, Sheriff, she said, weakly.  Please, Mrs. Walker, call me Killian.  My mother nodded and retreated back into a darkened corner to talk quietly with Sheriff Clerys wife, Grace.  What do you know, Sam? My dad asked as he rested his chin on his hands in a mock symbol of prayer, as though I may deliver him from his suffering.   Well, just, I heard Whitney had a boyfriend, that guy Pete Witiger that shes been hanging out with, and I saw them and Taylor Dranger leave this morning before me.  What time did they leave? Asked the Sheriff.  I dont knowlike before 6.  He nodded. That matches the statements of Taylor Dranger and the Witiger boy. My fathers head sunk lower into his hands and I knew Id let him down. But, I rushed, I dont think she went back to St. Louis because she was dating  Pete and I dont think she wanted to be with her boyfriend back home anymore.  I understand that, son, but a teenage girls mind is a complicated thing. My officers are trying to get ahold of the boyfriends family back in St. Louis. Clery nodded to my father. Now why dont you head up to your room and let us work, Samuel.  I looked up at him in surprise. What? No I wanna stay down here. I can help.  No, son, theres nothing more you can do here. Youve been a good brother, now let us handle this.  But I can help!  You already have.  Dad! I looked over at my dad with begging eyes.  Go to your room, Sam. He said quietly after a moment. I balked.  Dad  Now.  I was so angry I did the only thing that I could of to make my rage known - I stomped upstairs, slammed the door and then sat on my bed in disbelief. The tears came then and I laid there feeling helpless, worthless and scared for my sister.  I thought about all the places Whitney could be. Was she scared? Was she alone? Was shedead? When the sun began to set, I finally got out of bed and went to check my email. I was expecting lots of messages from Kimber and Kyle but there was only one.   *did she go to the treehouse?*  I sat staring at the computer screen for almost a minute, Kimbers words from last fall echoed in my brain.   *If you enter the treehouse without the proper ceremony youll disappear and then youll die.*  I didnt buy that Whitney had gone to Circle K that morning and I especially didnt believe that shed hitchhiked out of town. Nothing they were saying downstairs made any sense if you knew my sister  but maybe this did. Maybe she and her boyfriend went to the treehouse to make out or something and maybe hed left her there. Maybe shed gotten lost or maybe the Skinned Men had found her. That was the worst thought of all.   I didnt need to sneak out because the police were too busy with my parents to care about me anyway. I snuck my bike out of the garage and rode the three miles to the West Rim Prescott Ore Trail. When I got there I saw two bikes already locked to the signpost and my two best friends sitting in the snow next to them.  I knew youd come, Kyle said when I pulled my bike up and Kimber ran up to hug me.  Im so sorry, Sam.  There was really nothing for me to say and they didnt push. Kimber took my arm and we started up the trail. The silence between us was stretched, but comfortable. We trudged through the snow and all the while I searched for the telltale footprints of others but the snow was coming too fast. The hike up the mountain was harder and wetter than when wed come in the fall and when Ambercot Fort finally came into view over the ridge it was a welcome sight. The sun was getting low and we hadnt brought flashlights.   I fell as I ran up to the tree, calling my sisters name to the quiet wild. Kyle was right behind me and leapt impressively onto the rope ladder, climbing quickly up the planks. I kept calling Whitneys name, waiting for Kyle to yell that hed found her or that there was at least some sign of her.  And then I heard Kimber quietly say my name from where she stood at the Triple Tree. I ran over and tried to follow her eyes to confirm what I already knew was there. And then I found it, freshly carved near the top.   *Whitney* *W.*  My breath froze in my chest and my vision blurred with unwelcome tears. And as the sun took its last desperate breath before plunging into the deep of the horizon, a deafening metallic whirl sang out from the wilderness and spilled down the mountainside.     Phoenix Arizona checking in.    Im in complete agreement. I went to two of the Conan panels and they were by far my favorite things about those days. Although it was freakin hot in the theater.    Oh Disney, lighten up.    What is your favorite ride at a theme park?    So Ellen Pao was Severus Snape all along?    I screened The Visit at comic con last week (shyamalan/Blum collab). I enjoyed it. It was a simple narrative which facilitated its creepiness and the twist at the end paid off (and made sense).  It was sort of a horror/comedy and it really worked for the film.

I am female and I've probably written more from a woman's POV than a man's. Recently, though, I've been trying to write more men since it's a challenge for me.  I once wrote a story with a gender ambiguous Narrator. I thought it was kinda neat but people just ended up arguing about it in the comments!    This is very similar to my setup.    It was a nice mechanic to quiet the nonbelievers.    I agree here. I was readying the banners for OP until he called out a specific unnamed story as being "bad". That said, I agree with the argument that this sub would be a lot more fun if people weren't being graded on grammar and spelling. I still like to look at Nosleep as stories round the campfire.    Hey thanks man!    Ahhhh really? I was told that went away with the update. I'll have to try it. Thanks!    The problem is that some of us, myself especially, write stories that are too long to post in one thread. We don't really have a choice other than to split up the story.    What the hell is Charlie Charlie?   That's what I thought of too.   Ahhhhhh okay that makes sense.    I actually do wish we could up our word count! I always end having to trim down my posts.   Sent!   RemindMe! 2 days Donation for /r/millionairemakers   Paradise Valley School District is my suggestion.    Unfortunately not *the* professional.    Ehh, they handed that off to a professional.    Awww I'm trying to come around more, I miss you guys too.    So do I.   [Half-face picture ftw](http://i.imgur.com/x08FsjD.jpg)   "Life is short"   Life is literally the longest thing anyone ever does.    Someone posted the ending on goodreads.com and...yeah.    I came into the comments to make sure this is getting reported to someone but I can not click that link.    There was a hit and run on the I-10, the guy got off and from what I understand tried to take the u-turn on Dysart at the McDowell intersection but he was going too fast and rolled his car into Einstein's backyard. Driver was killed.    I agree that it's shady to hide the end of a Nosleep story behind a pay wall. Luckily, I have only seen it once.    I have priced this trip out before from Phoenix flying economy and yeah, I'd say $12k conservatively.    /r/pitchforkemporium   I'm intrigued.    Big Bang Theory. It's gotten so completely *boring*.    Michael Bay should only be directing people to their seats.    Once again, the conservative, sandwich-heavy portfolio pays off for the hungry investor.    Seconded.    I'm sad that you're leaving. I consider you one of the best writers on this board and I'll miss seeing your new stuff. All my best to you, Faust. Tempora mutantur, nos et mutamur in illis.   Female - I lean toward guilty.   Checking in - another girl who thinks Adnan is factually, if not legally, guilty.    Sent via PayPal!    It's the same here in Arizona.   	81

It's a pretty interesting AMA about starting your own chemistry startup.

One of the inhibitors I feel when thinking of starting a business of my own is my age (I'm 40), I feel like the ramp up of a business would take too long to pay off relative to my rather good paying job.  How long has it taken you to get your businesses self-sufficient?  (I believe they call this "crossing the valley of death.")

We should be able to respond to users without our usernames being visible.  We can send messages from the subreddit, but we can't respond to modmail this way. If you're explaining the official stance of the subreddit to a hostile user I don't see why your username is important. (The number of users who argue that the rules should not apply to them is too damn high!) It's just a way for users better target individual mods.    I agree, actually, the admins need to actually do something, most of the time there is just no response.  having a fully open mod log would allow bad actors to laser focus on the person who just enforced a rule.  This already happens way too much.  If you respond to a mod mail to explain why something was removed, even though you didn't do the removal, you can end up being comment stalked, and doxxed.   I think there is a disconnect because users don't see the incredibly hostile messages the mods of big subreddits constantly get.  We have constant reminders of how terrible people can be.

Trees are essentially ground water wicks that bring water to their leaves. Since water has a high affinity for cellulose, trees can grow quite tall!  But that's not your question.  If we are looking for an unwickable liquid, we would want high weight, and strong cohesive forces.  Off the top of my head, mercury fits this.  Mercury will spread out on certain metal surfaces, like aluminum, but it is actually dissolving the metal in the process, which would make for a poor wick!  It doesn't spread on normally found materials like wood, or plastic or glass.  Another possibility would be fluorocarbons, since they tend to repel both hydrophobic and hydrophilic surfaces.

How do you suggest dealing with the very real problem of mod stalking/death threats?    And when the admins are overwhelmed and they don't do, what happens then?  Because that will be the first couple of hours.  You can't rely on the admins for even the simplest of things history has shown, this is just a fact now.   I agree, and adding the line "in video games" would be unlikely to reduce the popularity of the post, while being more accurate and not misleading the reader about the scope of the study.

We have too many people removing things for that to be feasible, which is why we need the rules to be as specific as possible.   Would not be removed automatically because it isn't "invented by a"   Sorry, left out a word, that's what I get for typing on a phone while a 3 year old attacks me!   My subreddit is /r/science, we have a couple of custom bots in addition to automod, and our custom moderation set up.  We just have one of the most strictly moderated subreddit, in addition to one of the largest.   We can, and we'll watch things.    We're not completely clamping down on headlines, just taking a harder line on things.   We would like the traffic from our subreddit to encourage quality science journalism, not sensational headline engineering.   There are plenty of other words, we're just picking out one that has been abused in the past.  Right now it's just "invented by a"  that specific phrase.   of course.   It's an interesting idea, but it would be hard for users without a great deal of educational background to do.     Poor communication.  We ask the admins if this is a ban evader, because we can't tell, and then we don't get a response.   I changed the text to be [video]   Hi godsenfrik, your submission has been removed for the following reason(s)  It has a sensationalized, editorialized, or biased headline.    *If you feel this was done in error, or would like further clarification, please don't hesitate to [message the mods](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FScience message=My%20Post:%20https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/3cxkom/smoking_may_cause_schizophrenia_it_is_well_known/).*   In practice, this is not true.  Different mods remove different comments and ban different accounts. In a subreddit that makes little attempt to moderate comments it might be possible, but we had  close to 40,000 mod actions in the last month.   Peer-reviewed journal article appear in print and therefore don't have video associated with them, so the odds of missing something is low.   Mod of /r/science here, and actually, that was on our list of complaints.  We get a response from the admins maybe 1/5 messages.      How do we tell if they have evaded the ban or if they are just another shit head user?     That is how we use it, if it is just a little off, we tag, if it misrepresents, it's removed.     Report any comments that say that, and we'll remove them.  Our mod team is reasonably effective, it may be less common than you are recalling (confirmation bias and all that.)   We could set up "correlation" to trigger and auto-report to the mods.   We will try to do this, we don't tag things as misleading that often.   oh, we'll look at some examples and see, it might be on the blocks...   Sad to say, we don't get many computer science articles.     The flair would show 'Misleading, see comm...]  the character limit is annoying.    The issues of a default are well known, and /r/science is the oldest default.   Must be early on-set mental degeneration.  I'll probably be wearing adult diapers in six months.   Ugly work around, but welcome to the world of being a mod on reddit, where you don't get even simple tools.   I'm not concerned about karma personally, I have never sought it (as you can tell by my relatively low karma for a 7 yr old account.) If we had a mod abusing sticky comments for that purpose we would remove them as mods.   That would be fine, just don't call it out as a video in the title.   Pessimist!   We have been asking for the ability to make sticky comments for literally years, this is part of the blackout motivations.   In this case, yes.  Scientific publications don't say "invented by" so it's pretty easy to make that rule.   You didn't even try to read the post, did you?   We'd rather them reach the front page for the right reasons- meaningful research - rather than a sensationalized headline.   Videos are not allowed because of experience, while there might be some good ones, a vast majority are just fluff.  It was allowed for years, but it just became a problem.     I can't imagine a post with an equation in the title that isn't a bit off.   um...yeah. :-)   True, but "by a" might be too broad for an auto-remove.   Things are far from perfect, we are still trying to figure out a good way to address things, if you have ideas, please let us know!   We can't make flair a link, unfortunately, it's a limitation of reddit.  Good idea though!  We can try to make a post though, that should be doable, but the issue there is we have no way of making that post visible, it would likely be buried.   It's easy to accidentally say something that an expert in the field finds misleading.   We discussed it with user groups for a while, and now we're open to suggestions to improve our policies.    Maybe we should add "invented by a" to the removal phrases, I doubt I've ever seen that in a non-sensationalized title.   Sure, or just send an email to sciencereddit@gmail.com   Thanks, it's back out.   This is a on-going issue, a big part of the problem is people who aren't experts in an area would make misleading headlines and never know it.  Not an easy thing to police.   We'll make an exception, simple.  I doubt we'll have to make many of those.

In addition to the [existing rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/wiki/rules#wiki_submission_rules), we're adding these.  **Headlines may not:**    - **ask a question** (anything with a '?') Linked articles which have a question in the title should be re-written to describe the content of the paper in keeping with our existing rules against editorializing and sensationalizing.    - **make claims of resolving a long standing issue/cure/mystery.**    -  **use an exclamation point.**    - **makes general statements about large groups** (e.g. "men don't trust women", "Doctors hate him") The headline should indicate the group that the finding applies to.    - **have a list mentioned.** (e.g. top 10 things you must read)    - **makes reference to the thoughts or feelings of the reader.**  (e.g. "You'll never expect this")    - **contain the word "[Video]" or related terms** (since we don't allow videos, linking to a page that contains a video is not allowed.)   **All Submission must have flair assigned**  The mods have been assigning appropriate flair to unflaired submissions, but we are no longer going to do this.  Unflaired submissions will be removed.  There will be 5 minutes of time to flair a post, after which it will be subject to removal, with notification.  If you have additional thoughts on how to make more specific headline rules or add rules, we'd like to hear them.  We will be testing things out and we may make changes as needed.   Thanks!    	130
 It's pretty good. Maurice Leroux did a few other french short film scores throughout the 1950's and 1960's.    If you go to Barnes and Noble before the 27th of July you can pick it up on sale for 10 dollars and it comes with White Mane ( another great short film)   Ace in the Hole was a blind buy for me...loved it!

 It sounds like you should seek professional help. Also, you might want to break up with your boyfriend. You've been together since you were 15, so unless your intention is to stay together forever, get out now so that you can explore your inner self, your wants and your needs by yourself while you're still young.   But the Fantastic Mr. Fox says dogs like blueberries. Or is that only beagles?   I looked some more. Maybe this?   http://anybencher.com/bencher/siddurim/weekday-siddur-454   I have a tiny weekday one that I got from a bar mitzvah. I can't believe I can't find a picture of something like it online. It's about 4.5 x 3 x .25.        Lately I've been doing [this](http://yogaone.com/index.php) one that says it's Hatha, and [this](http://www.happyyoga.tv/) one that doesn't say.    They should be certified as yoga instructors. I don't know if they all are, though.   There may be more languages that are even more difficult than German, but that doesn't make German "fairly easy." I'd say French is "fairly easy." It may have a million tenses but it's all very straightforward. I don't get how you're supposed to understand a German sentence the first time around when the "nicht" is at the end. It's like, blah blah blah NOT! Ha, ha, tricked you!   Yoga isn't PE class. Plank is strenuous. I've recently been doing two different classes on video and even the hard one that had crow pose (I didn't even bother trying it) hasn't done plank yet.   Also what's your definition of ruin someone's life?  Being fired from your job, losing all your friend, family and partner, and being homeless. It doesn't sound like he had a job, it doesn't sound like he lost his partner, though yes, he was estranged from his family who he lived 2,000 miles away from in the first place. And it doesn't sound like he was ever homeless.   I've been doing yoga on and off for 15 years and things like plank and "hog tie" are not standard, and neither is a 75-minute class. The one difficult pose that I've found to be standard is down dog. Fifteen years and I still can't do it well.      A beginner should go to a beginner's class where they show you proper positioning and alternate versions if you aren't as flexible. OP should not have gone to this class.   Funny, but: How did he remember all these poses and how well he did them? Did he take notes? Also, sounds like he went to an intermediate or advanced class. Obviously not appropriate for someone who's never done yoga before. He didn't fuck up as much as his GF did by bringing him to this class since there's no such thing as fucking up in yoga. Yoga is non-competitive. You do the best you can and that's all that matters.   It's not without its flaws and you have to push past the first 85 pages to get to the meat of the story, but this seems like the kind of book many Redditors would like so I decided to recommend it. Larson's first book The Selected Works of T.S. Spivet was better.  Here's a positive review of the book: http://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/books/i-am-radar-by-reif-larsen/2015/04/09/77a75312-d6f5-11e4-ba28-f2a685dc7f89_story.html   Not really. The Wikipedia article is vague and in fact, seems like it might be purposefully evasive about the fact that he was already on disability.   OP's headline is just misleading all around. The media didn't out him, Harvey Milk did, and it's not clear that it ruined his life as much as exacerbated problems that he already had.   From the article you cited:  Sipple's relatives in Detroit said the publicity shattered the Vietnam veteran, who had a history of hypertension and heart problems that led to a medical discharge from the service. He lived on a disability pension.  Sounds to me like it exacerbated problems that he already had. But either way, what you say you learned is supposed to be in the source you cited. OP did not cite this article.   I see no evidence in this Wikipedia page of any direct connection between Sipple's decline and being outed. This doesn't remotely say that being outed ruined his life.  Sipple's mental and physical health sharply declined over the years. He drank heavily, gained weight to 300 lb (140 kg), was fitted with a pacemaker, and became paranoid and suicidal. The incident brought him so much attention that, later in life, while drinking, he would express regret towards grabbing Moore's gun. Sipple, who was wounded in the head in Vietnam, was also diagnosed paranoid schizophrenic according to the coroner's report.   This is what windshield screen covers are for.    Bought chocolate for my neighbor.  Not entirely sure this counts as a good deed, but at least it's something I did for somebody else. If you'd have asked this yesterday the answer would have been "nothing."   Maybe: La Marseillaise, Au clair de la lune, and Frere Jacques.   huge crowds of people on it constantly  I keep forgetting it's the summer. Maybe I'll tell them this isn't a good idea. Too crowded.    Some restaurants and touristy places are less accessible and might be narrow with tight corners.  That's what I was a little afraid of, considering that lots of these places are historic buildings, not exactly built to ADA standards. But I'm asking for my parents and if the attraction was relatively small they should be able to leave the scooters outside.    Are there any specific places you want to go so I can give you more useful answers?  I'm asking for my parents and they haven't looked into an itinerary yet. I thought they might like the Freedom Trail, but it's been a while since I was in Boston and I can't remember what else I saw there.    No, it was a recently published book.   No, it had an orange (or maybe red) cover with a few black and white stripes. The eye was a drawing, not a person's eye.   (I think.)   It was a self-published book only available on this guy's website, which is now defunct. And frankly, it sounds like a scam anyway, so you're not missing anything.   I think it was by a woman. It was not related to the Illuminati.  I found it: The Ghost Network by Catie Disabato.  http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22889883-the-ghost-network  I had it on hold at the library and they canceled my hold. Now I'm at the end of the list again. Idiots.       I lost out on two apartments to people offering cash. Both were over $500k.  My first guess was that it's criminals looking to launder money. My second guess was it's people looking for an investment and plan to rent out the apartment. Both of which suck. I cannot think of any possible scenario where the people don't suck.   Which is what?    Cotton, in particular, is absorbent, so it absorbs the sweat from your body, making you feel cooler. Polyester isn't absorbent so you stay bathed in your sweat, making you feel hotter.    First off, where you gain and lose fat from is genetic. Second, the weight tends to be gained or lost from large chunks of your body at a time. So some people will lose it first from the top, some from the middle, and some from the bottom. It's not possible to lose weight in one arm and not other.  It is possible to only work out one arm and not the other and then yes, one arm will be developed and muscular and the other won't be.   I don't see any reason why you can't call them. The organization may be Christian but anybody can volunteer for the hotline and they're not going to try to convert you.   Friday night I abandoned Selfish: Sixteen Writers on the Decision Not to Have Kids edited by Meghan Daum. I don't have kids, I don't want kids, but I found this book depressing.   Yesterday abandoned Rain on the Dead by Jack Higgins. I'm just so sick of his Sean Dillon books. They're too formulaic and shallow. Not reading Higgins ever again unless it's about something other than Dillon and friends.   I would go to Amazon or Goodreads and read them whatever description it has there.    It might be better if they hid them the way they hide unhelpful comments in responses to the reviews. But you can't remove them because that would also remove the star rating they gave and it's misleading if you removed a lot of the one and two star reviews just because the people couldn't come up with a cogent reason for disliking the book. They represent all the people that think like them. And believe me, if one person has a certain opinion, it's guaranteed that other people do too.   I'll pencil him in for around 4.     Saturday, September 12, 2015.  I thought Moshiach can't come on Shabbos?  But either way, that date works for me. I'll be ready and waiting.   On my reading stack for tonight:   - Selfish: Sixteen Writers on the Decision Not to Have Kids edited by Meghan Daum  - Burn by James Patterson and Michael Ledwidge   Sometimes a cigar is just a cigar. ;)  Happy 4th!   I'd rather not vilify the guy without more information. OP's post doesn't indicate that he does this with anything else but food.   I don't think he's being inconsiderate as much as he's being hungry. As long as he's not gaining weight, he can eat as much as he wants (within reason). And if there isn't enough food for two people it means they're not buying enough food to begin with. So like you said, buy more food.   My feeling is that it's a kind of hypercorrection. Like, teachers tell you not to say "me and him," but instead "he and I," so some people have a tendency to say "he and I" even when it's wrong.  In American English we tend to soften words with T's in them: butter become budder, metal becomes medal. So some people are hypercorrecting all T words to into D words even though that's not how Americans typically pronounce those words.  I've heard it in the New York metro area. I don't know if this is a country-wide thing.   Sometimes I like to call a puddle a "poodle."      I wasn't sure what you were getting at since I tend to doubt this is the case.    That would mean they know each other.     One is not allowed to undergo any intentionally sterilizing surgery or procedure, including SRS and hormone replacement.  Many trans people don't undergo surgery and hormones don't necessarily make you sterile. There was that transman that had a baby for pete's sake.   To me, if you're having a baby, you're not a man. You just can't have it both ways.   Goes all the way back to the ancient Romans.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orient   men kill for sex, while women kill for money  And where do angels of mercy fall into this scheme? Especially considering that they are of both genders.    I got it right because I assumed it was trying to trick me and therefore the simplest explanation couldn't possibly be the right one. I kept testing various possibilities to make sure I hadn't missed anything. I am the 9%!  Trying to bring this into politics and business seemed like a bit of a stretch, though.    The EPA regulates pesticide usage. Here's the law (PDF doc): http://www.epa.gov/opp00001/regulating/fifra.pdf   Israel annexed East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights only; the Golan Heights was never part of the partition plan, it was part of Syria. Israel offered to give it back in exchange for a peace agreement. The offer was rejected. Gaza and the West Bank were never annexed.   Source that misusing mothballs is a federal crime?  I see articles about it being a state violation for misuse of a pesticide. Pesticides are poison and can be harmful to humans and domestic or protected animals if misused.   The title is clickbait. Amazon wouldn't say how they arrived at the conclusion that the blog writer knows the author she's reviewing. It's highly unlikely that they won't let you review an author whose Twitter you follow.   Now, Amazon could very easily be mistaken, but considering the blog author won't name the book she wanted to review, it's a he-said/she-said situation because neither side can be verified by someone on the outside.   This is a picture of a shrimp farm: http://www.fishfarming.com/sites/default/files/Finca-Camaronera-de-C.I.-OCEANOS_panaraimio.jpg  The problem is that it's similar but not exactly the same and it's certainly not blue.   Maybe try /r/whatisthisthing.   Not that -- the lighting on the cat looks different than in the rest of the picture.   So I'm the only person that thinks this picture looks fake, then?   /r/writing  But, don't put the cart before the horse. If the book isn't written yet, getting a publisher should be the last thing on your mind.   I didn't say hers were fake, I said the way you get breasts like that is either by being lucky enough to have good genes or by buying them; wearing a bra or not doesn't make any difference unless the breasts are fairly small.   This is true, but only for small breasts.   Breasts like the white woman has are either genetic or fake, helped along by the fact that she's relatively young, and quite thin.   Edit: word   Fat suits are usually pretty offensive but the difference is that there isn't a long history of anti-fat entertainment and slavery of fat people.  As for CGI dwarves, I don't know what you're referring to.   It's both.    Considering the absence of other animal welfare laws in there  There are definitely other animal welfare laws. For example, animal cruelty is forbidden and you must feed your animal before you feed yourself.    Deuteronomy, for instance, says that animals with divided hoofs or that chew the cud can be eaten; but it also forbids camels from being eaten  Not or -- and. They have to chew their cud and have split hooves. This is why camels, pigs, hares and hyraxes are forbidden.    My friend told me my mom was cool because she used the word "ergo." So... my mom is special because she has a good vocabulary and she isn't afraid to use it.   There is no logic behind it. It's just a cultural fad. Here's a portrait of a man with long hair from the mid-17th century: http://www.gettyimages.com/detail/illustration/man-with-black-bows-by-sebastien-bourdon-oil-on-canvas-stock-graphic/149319874   Smile benevolently.    I accidentally left some of my groceries at my parents' house and now I have to buy more to replace them because we live too far away from each for me to just pop over and pick up my stuff. I'm so angry at myself right now.    Exercise doesn't have to be strenuous to make you feel good. I did a pretty mild yoga routine yesterday and I felt so good afterwards because I'm often tense and my muscles are tight, so relaxing and loosening them was great.   Where did you see this? It makes me think of algae/shrimp farms.   You're right that it amounted to an occupation, but when you use that word, people who don't understand the situation probably imagine it's like Red Dawn -- the commies marching in and taking over because, well, that's what commies do! Or even like the US using WMD as an excuse to march into Iraq and topple its dictator because oil, duh.   What was missing from moussa's posts is the context of what happened. Lebanon had been involved in a civil war for a while before Israel got involved, not to mention the fact that Syria also was occupying the country.   It was a very complicated situation and boiling it down to "it's all Israel's fault" is simply untrue and upvoting what he wrote is a demonstration of biased ignorance.   When you try to request a kit, it asks you to put in "date/time observed" and "description." What am I supposed to write? I haven't "observed" any lead, but maybe I suspect there is some in the pipes?   Huh. Thanks.    If by downtown you mean the Loop, neither of those restaurants are nearby and there are no Orthodox shuls there that have a Shabbos minyan. About a mile and a half north of the Loop is a Chabad house.   There's a Loop listing on godaven.com that's misleading. It sounds Orthodox but it's actually "Traditional."  But however it works out, enjoy. I liked Chicago a lot.   20,000 is not a universally recognized number and the people that were killed were not targeted by anybody, they were just unfortunately there; their deaths are attributable to all the forces that were fighting, not just Israel.  According to American military analyst Richard Gabriel, all factions in the conflicts agree that between 4,000 and 5,000 civilians died during the siege caused by military activity of all sides. He states that most of the observers that were present of the ground and other relevant sources in Lebanon agree that estimates of 8,000 - 10,000 are too high.[91]   And I'm sick of ignorant people who have no idea of what the true history of the area is, bringing Israel into an unrelated discussion about half-naked ladies protesting the extremists in their own religion. As someone else mentioned above, a Muslim group bombing marines barracks was what put Beirut on the map for most Americans as a dangerous place.   What you wrote completely misrepresented the situation. In the fight against the PLO, Israel pushed into Lebanon, laid siege to Beirut, held the area for less than a year and later held onto a small piece of land at the border between Israel and Lebanon in conjunction with the Lebanese militia group the South Lebanese Army. This is what Hezbollah was formed to fight: Israel and its Lebanese allies.    Israel never occupied Lebanon. It held a small bit of land at the border in conjunction with the South Lebanon Army as part of their fight against the PLO.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli%E2%80%93Lebanese_conflict   I'm not saying it's aliens.... but it's aliens.  But seriously, without a picture and location it's impossible to say for sure what it is you've seen.   It's not just music that grows on you, it's anything at all that you haven't experienced before. People tend to dislike new things but once they get used to them and they don't feel new anymore, they usually like them more. That's why, for example, they suggest you try a new food ten times before deciding you don't like it.   Also, dogs and cats are like perpetual babies -- you either have to walk them and pick up their poop or you have to clean out their litter box. Some people aren't interested in doing either of those things. Even a fish in a fancy tank doesn't entirely take care of itself.   So a pet is a responsibility that not everybody's interested in taking on.   To properly judge you need to have studied the art and history of fashion. That way you can tell if something is original or derivative; is it using color, shape, and fabric in a creative way; does it reflect the times we live in; etc. It's no different than being able to judge any other art form. Obviously if you know nothing about fashion you can look at it and say, "That looks ridiculous," but it's a worthless opinion.   Honestly, I believe it's a lack of having anything interesting to say about the human condition as well as a general lack of creativity. Sure the Beatles have a lot of songs about love, but they also have a song about a dude who aspires to write paperback books. A song about living in a yellow submarine. A song about a girl in the sky. A song about a street.  You can write a song about anything if you have something to say and an interesting way of saying it. Most writers don't so they fall back on an easy subject: love.   While societal pressure contributes to things like anorexia and bulimia, as someone said above, it's still a mental disorder. It's kind of like how society says that washing your hands is important, but a person with OCD who washes their hands 20 times in a row has a problem.    Most first world deaths are not caused by illnesses that your immune system plays any part in fighting. They are heart disease, stroke, and diabetes. You can have all of these problems and if you didn't go to the doctor you could very easily just fall down and die one day without ever having known you were sick.    Yes.    This is irrelevant except to point out that it's not mostly Vietnamese, at least not in NYC.   This is an interesting article which suggests that before the flood people really did live that long.  https://answersingenesis.org/bible-timeline/genealogy/did-adam-and-noah-really-live-over-900-years/  Edit: OP asked a question in terms of if you believe the Bible is true. Gets downvoted for providing that answer.    In case the question didn't make any sense: Why is it that a lot of apartments in my area have dishwashers but don't allow washing machines? Are they very different in terms of how much water and power they use or is it something else?    I'm not comparing them to myself, I'm comparing them to people who are attractive, say, young Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie. They were smoking hot.    I thought she was bad in that. And miscast too.    Not always. It's hard to find someone attractive if you can't remember what they look like because their face is so generic.   I do it to avoid stepping in the dog poop.   I've never liked Jennifer Lawrence. She can't act and isn't pretty. I'm not sure Chris Pratt can act either, but at least watching him is fun. I'm also undecided if he's actually good-looking or just attractive in a generic sort of way.   Please. I'm a comment karma courtesan.    Is he legit?  Very clearly not.   And it's in his FAQ too.  Is this a Jewish organization?  No it is not.  ETA: Here are two legit but very old websites about the Jewish community on Malta:  http://www.angelfire.com/al/AttardBezzinaLawrenc/ (Angelfire?!?!)  http://www.jewsofmalta.org/   It's a three-volume set. If it were a first edition, it looks like it would be worth upwards of $400, but considering it isn't, it's worth less or not much at all.  http://www.abebooks.com/servlet/SearchResults?an=sanders fe=on n=100121503 tn=Deutschen%20Sprache   Sure, but "contaminated" is a loaded word so I don't think it's a good one to use in this context.   I would think they are. Things that you "know" usually don't count for much in Judaism if they can't be materially proven.   The way that you prove that your family is Jewish is usually through marriage records so if they were able to have a Jewish wedding, I guess that's all that really matters. I'm not sure that it's about practicing as much as throwing your lot in with the Jewish people.  Edited: More accurate wording.   If a family practices Judaism for three (or four) generations they're considered Jewish and nothing before that matters.       His name is Easton and he won Best In Show in Springfield, Ohio, in March, 2012.  Source: http://home.comcast.net/~hopkinsj6/PIGS/Breeding.htm      What? Above you said Goebbels would sound like Gerbbels, not Gorbbels.   Goethe sounds like Gerta. I see no evidence that this pronunciation only came about during WWII.   I was answering your question about whether pork is considered contamination or not.   Considering people were talking about Goethe before Goebbels was even born, I'm going to have to assume that this is a joke answer.   Potatoes are not bad for you. They are rich in vitamins, minerals, and fiber and are not like eating bread.   First, nobody thinks of it as being "contamination." Second, even if they did, it would be of a spiritual sort, not a physical one.    Whoever told you this is very much mistaken.      In my opinion, an Orthodox education or an extremely rigorous Conservative one, assuming such a thing exists.    IIRC you do have to have some sort of intention. If you meant to eat non-kosher but accidentally ate kosher instead, that's still considered a sin.    Assuming you grew up without a Jewish education, you're considered a "tinok shenishba" and cannot be blamed for not believing, which means that most Jews you encounter will not care and the ones that do look down on you are the kind of people that look down on everyone, so it's not personal.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tinok_shenishba    Many women wear pants, don't cover their hair, and my sources tell me that apparently premarital sex is a thing  None of these things make a person Conservative (or Conservadox) in any way.    The fact is, this is no worse than the process most employers use now. It's been shown time and again that unstructured interviews do not result in the hiring of the best candidate.   These are so much better. Remember, they're just for babies and the purple one could be for a girl or a boy!  http://i.imgur.com/bEGsK3N.jpg   I don't understand the difference between "General perfectionists" and "Behavioral responders."  Also, there's a fifth type -- a child who refuses to eat as a means of defiance or control.     Can you actually name your son "Loser" in US?  Yes, you can, especially since it's a German last name and therefore  might be used as someone's first name, and is a Jewish nickname for the Biblical name Elazar.  https://www.houseofnames.com/loser-family-crest   It's an emotionally persuasive way of speaking because Christianity emphasizes faith in Jesus, as compared to the way that a rabbi might give a sermon in a straightforward tone, which is meant to be intellectually appealing, because Judaism emphasizes learning about the religion.  I don't know if they learn it in "preacher school" but certainly they learn it from listening to other preachers speak that way.    Not a novel, but Blood Pact and Other Stories by Mario Benedetti.  Kings of Infinite Space by James Hynes.     Charles Bukowski + cats. If Reddit would have a bible, it sounds like this would be in the running.  ETA: "Practical cats" is (as far as I can tell) a pointless reference to Old Possum's Book of Practical Cats by T. S. Eliot.       It's not about ignoring it, it's about facing the reality if a man is afraid of being raped, statistically he has a lot more to fear from another man than from a woman.  By highlighting woman on man rape you are perpetrating a myth, which hurts the majority of victims.  	126
 1.0 was considered a beta. It was pretty damn stable as far as random crashes go. But there was nothing horribly janky about the software. This was before the gamecube 3 frame delay was removed, before replays desynced, before lightpresses were put in, before individual input was a thing, before a lot of things. There were only 14 characters too. I believe Lucas, Sonic, Snake, and Falco were all in there, but I forget who else. It wasn't a very huge bunch, so it wasn't very popular for tournament play either.   This post has been removed because the linked compilation does not credit the viners who made the vines.   I would chalk it up to the NX being announced, not the Wii U's limitations. They probably just don't think the game will sell. Racer's are the easiest fucking thing and least limited thing to make when you think about how basic the programming must be and how the game doesn't even have to look that good since you're going by everything too fast to pay attention.   "Don't shoot until you see the whites of their eyes, or I'm telling mom!"   A lot of drama is added to the TV show's duels which creates turns that last 3-5 minutes especially when you consider each card effect is explained no matter how many times it's already been used. The writers are assuming there are going to be people who watch that episode as their first episode.  But our turns can actually go pretty quickly, and we deal up to a full 8k life points in a single turn. For us, it's desired. The TV show still lengthens duels by having damage be limited to about 200-1500 per turn most of the time. Not to mention, the TV show is very dramatized so those 3-5 minutes turns get stretched even further.   I got into it first.   I asked my mom to tell me a story from when I was young.   Son, when you were young. You'd be all over the place. I couldn't keep you from running up and down the stairs. You couldn't decide if you wanted to be up or down, I couldn't keep up with ya. And I didn't really want to try. Oh, and how hungry you were. You were always asking for little snacks before dinner time. Most of the time I'd feed you an apple. And you calmed down. Before you were 7 you kept saying Apples are your favorite food in the entire universe. Those were your words. "Apples are my favorite food in the entire universe." That was until you discovered mushroom pizza. You'd start looking for mushroom pizza every time we ordered it. Sometimes you would get so sad when you didn't see any. You had to settle for pepperoni or plain cheese.   But I digress. That's just when you were young and what you were like. One day, we went to an amusement park, and you kept trying to run ahead to play games and get on rides. I kept asking you to slow down, but you were so excited when you learned you could go on as many rides as you wanted for free. Didn't cost any money or tickets. So you wanted to ride on every roller coaster.   I loved that joy in you. How you were always happy to spend time with me.  I asked my dad to tell me a story from when I was young.   There isn't a lot of anything exciting to tell. You were pretty quit when you were with me. Your older siblings always asked for things from me and you just sort of asked for a slurpee or something every now and then. Even when I'd try to figure out thins about you like your favorite food or color. Wasn't until you were 8 I learned your favorite food was apples.   I never really saw you running. It seemed like you wanted to play with everyone around you but you got quit when I walked in. Like you were saying bad words and you had to stop talking in front of me. But you weren't saying anything bad. I know, I listened from around the corner. I had to ask questions to get you to talk to me. But, even when I asked what you want on your pizza you would just say nothing. Same with burgers. I'd get you a burger and you'd just want it plain.   I kept asking your mom how to get through to you. She kept saying to give you things to do. Don't let you be bored.  When I was four, I asked my mom about a purple spot on her face.   Ask your father.  I did ask my dad. I became ten dollars richer not to talk about it.  No wonder my parents are divorced.   Other racist republicans. That's who supports him.   "TIL girls don't have penises. they just have a hole called a vagina."   "Guys, we accepted Ant Man. At this point, I think we're too fucking dumb to reject a single idea."   I sense a very necessary lawsuit.   TL:DR  We don't know shit   "Him? He's a dummy."   It's about a few cards I really like. But one in particular is what I had in mind. Rekindling isn't it.    Though it needs a deck  Dedicated to its use  Limited to one   Who wants to guess how many years of effort it takes to unlock everything without paying for anything?'  "Unlock Ryu: Pay 525,600 SF Coins."  "To earn SF Coins, play the online and win games. You will get one coin for every win."   The title can be put into the picture or on the webpage with Imgur. I just hate it when the joke requires two pages.   I think the rule should be "Your image should be funny without having to read the text in you [fucking] title."  Bracketed words optional.  Seriously. I click on so many things that happen to be in /r/funny. And a lot of times I get some crap that doesn't make sense until I read or re-read the title. If it isn't funny without the title, don't post it.   SSing him from wherever late turn could basically act as a "fuck your defenses" in a competent Hero deck. Not to mention, constant searching from any of his summons where you don't shit on your opponent's defenses.   Did they actually expect anything special from an iPod touch?   These rules shouldn't get under anybody's skin. They are absolutely needed.   Use vine client if you must. I've never had vine clip anything from my vines.   That's better. I'll update your info right now.   I'd really like a feature like this as well. I've even googled for it, but I've found nothing.   I just got it all updated. In the future, if you need a flair update, just let the mods know along with a link to your feedback thread.   1. You don't have any historical feedback. Historical feedback is NOT feedback from previous threads. That should be labeled as Previous Thread.  2. That thread is archived. Leave a link when you make a new one.   I got you updated.   Please tell me this is all real. I love the melee aesthetics more than brawl's.  Edit: Yay. It's real. I'll be using this as a basis for my builds!!! but, I think the general consensus is that the toon link textures are a fucking tragedy.   I've woken up at 8 just to spend until 1 in the afternoon just dealing with mod mail. Just a few clicks, my ass.   Who gets rid of the shits that troll and ruin good discussion? Who gets rid of horrible duplicate threads and cuts down on clutter? Who moved trading and selling to other subreddits to give discussion a spotlight on the main sub? Thank your fucking mods.   "I'm racist. You should be too. Close the borders."   Throw him under a bridge! Woot woot. Based mods. Kappa.   A bit of drama? Let's watch boys and girls.  Caineghest is an awesome mod btw.   Sometimes I have to be a real dick to get a point across. I don't think I'll want to mod here until the rest of my mod places are good. I gracefully neglected ygofeedback for a while and now we're very behind on setting up threads and flairs.  The current mods are doing very well. Maybe I'll apply if they ever need more. But for now, I like having my hands ful with what I have. I love Yu-Gi-Oh! And modding around has been a result of getting back into the game.  Yu-Gi-Oh! Modding and Smash Bros are basically my hobbies now.   Your landlord doesn't do anything for you for free. He takes your money.  Apples to oranges.   The community was once tearing each other apart and posting the most random shit that still managed to get invited to the front. The mods put a lot of work not only in making this place look nice and organizing content with the side bar, they weeded shit out and got binders and trades their own subreddits so the constant complaining about this being "binder subreddit".  You're fucking welcome.   I imagine that the mods of /r/Yu-Gi-Oh! Work a lot harder than I do. I don't care so much about the thanks. I run the subs that I do because I love the game. I'm asking everyone to thank the main mods not me. If I didn't already look like an ass, here's a news flash. Go fuck yourself. I don't mod this sub, therefor I'm not asking for thank yous. I'm asking that everyone make sure /r/Yugioh has mods that don't go underappreciated.   "I'm Drewww  "He's drewwww  "He's Drewwww  "It's the Whose Line Making of... Behind the sceeeeenes"  *while scene is sung a baritone goes slow and sings* "The untold storyyyyyy"   To make it clear, I don't moderate this subreddit. But, I'm a mod on /r/ygobinder, /r/ygosales, /r/yugioh101, /r/ygofeedback, /r/customyugioh, /r/vine, /r/complainaboutanything and more. And on top of deciding what content to leave in and weed out, they deal with rude users, users being rude to other users, deciding on a subreddit's style, implenting features and organizing discussion, and continuously updating the sidebar to reflect any and all changes in its organization.  They do it for free. They don't put up a donation button, they don't have experience to put on their resume, they don't start a patreon to keep it going. They do it for free.  I want to thank all of the other mods of this subreddit and the other yugioh subreddits. I can imagine that moderating this sub has to be a lot of work compared to the sister subreddits that handle far fewer users. It's like a garden. It doesn't go on pause because you don't feel like tending to it for one day. If you leave it alone for a few days, weeds start piling up, plants start withering, and users often get away with harassing each other and starting many duplicate threads. Just today I saw 2-3 threads trying to be the first to start a banlist discussion.  If a moderator helps you with anything, send them a thanks. When users start bugging you or bad and unwanted content starts propping up, be glad the mods are there to help keep quality up. While I still object to a lot of design choices (I'm a designer, sue me), this site looks great, feels fun, and is very well organized. I find it absolutely amazing how much work they have put in.  Sorry, but I just couldn't wait until the weekend free talk to post this.   Current Feedback and Total feedback mean the same thing. Current feedback doesn't mean current thread.   You do not have any historical feedback. Please list your historical feedback as "previous thread."   It's great that you have 11 positive on the DN forum, but that cannot actually count toward your current feedback. Also, please format the link like this:  [+11 from DN](http://forum.duelingnetwork.com/index.php?/user/36855-the-vampire-prince/)  Do this by putting +11 from DN in brackets immediately followed by the link in parenthesis.  [text](link)  It's good reference, and if there's ever a match or dispute, it can help you in your favor.   Please put each category on a different line   Evidence suggests you've probably done something to gain illegitimate followers and are now self-promoting a rather bland and mediocre channel. While it isn't grounds for removal, we strongly suggest not promoting yourself through bragging about your numbers, just post your content here one vine at a time.   I'm going to try to get us caught up, but I need to know which people are serious about trading here. Please leave a link to your current feedback thread here if  * You're not on the traders list. * You don't have flair * Your flair is outdated * Your link on the traders list goes to an outdated or archived thread.  I'm taking personal responsibility for getting this subreddit up to date with all users' flair and for getting our trader's list up to date. I'm going to be taking care of some threads left in the mod mail, but there may be a lot that I miss. Please, if you're planning to use this subreddit, make sure your feedback thread is set up.  Previous sticky:  https://www.reddit.com/r/YGOFeedback/comments/20dtie/rules_and_regulations_v3_read_before_submitting/   What word did I misspell?   Again, I repeat that **I don't want Reddit enhancement suite**. I hate that software to death. The only feature I actually liked was being able to see how my text would look before I posted. I'm looking to see if there's an extension like that.   Alright... whose browser technology did they buy up and say "us only".  Sarcasm aside. These benchmarks don't mean shit in real world application.   Well, family oriented has never actually been inherently kid-focused. We just think it does because we're used to people appealing to the lowest common denominator. But ABC Family is a family oriented television station with almost all of its shows appealing to ages 10-50. Hell, I watched Smallville when I was barely into my teenage years. Same for Gilmore Girls and a lot of other ABC Family shows.    Even your girlfriend who secretly fantasizes about smashing your xbox with a hammer is probably cool with nintendo  Totally unrelated, but my girlfriend is actually a huge gamer. She introduced me to Left 4 Dead and the Jak and Daxter series among other things. I think the only long-running thing I got her into was Metroid. She and I both have a Wii U of our own and she occasionally plays Xbox for fun on CoD or Left 4 Dead or Minecraft or whatever. But... guess which one she plays most.   This just goes to show that anyone who loves games but doesn't have a Wii U simply doesn't know what he or she is missing.   Well, they see the OCG as a test of what's truly good against one another, so when they figure out what's good, they see us as huge fucking dollar signs with making all the good shit expensive and hard to find. Sure Konami, they expect us to believe that bullshit of wanting every card available to every player.   Yeah, people have posted about this 5,000 times, so I don't know why this guy still got a lot of fucking karma. JUST VOTE ON THE LINKS YOU FUCKING CLICK.   If there's a shared computer somewhere around, an iPad will be enough. He can transfer things to the computer if he needs printing, or hook up to blue-tooth printing. If he's going into senior year, I'd say hold off and give him a laptop for Christmas maybe because he'll need a computer for the world. But if he's just a freshmen, fuck no he doesn't need his own computer. Even if you do get him one for Christmas, he doesn't need a Pro. Especially if he's just feeling entitled or needy. A $500 refurbished one from 3rd party is fine. My girlfriend has that and she's going into college soon. It works great for what she needs.   "If I ask her to have sex with me right now, will she say yes?... How about if I ask her *now*?"   I'm not quite fond of the app store app disappearing on me.   In the future, please just leave negative feedback and/or report that person to the moderators. We take no pity on you since you did violate the $80 price cap. Anything exceeding that should take advantage of our ebay thread.   "Sir what are we gonna do with these security holes?"  "Just set them anywhere. We still need to hold a 10,000 men meeting on what our start menu is going to look like."   "I didn't know he was checking me for cheating the entire time just because I'm black."   "MOM, OH MY GOD. I told you before the sock means only if I invite you!"   I don't think I've ever met an apple user who uses it as a status symbol. I don't even think it qualifies anymore since you don't have to be rich to get one, and not all rich people use apple.   Probably because "market share" doesn't directly translate to install base. They're two different things.   6 figures x multiple politicians adds up to billions of dollars into buying politicians making much more than PewDiePie.      "Ok, google... how high am I?"   Here is a song I wrote to honor Mr. Iwata's passing and in loving memory of his career.  [Iwata Song Retro Version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WkUJLpO3Ns)   [Iwata Song Contemporary Version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTngaCkd4RA)   Your body goes through long cycles to wake up and go to sleep. If you're going back to sleep and have your alarm interrupt you while you're falling back asleep or barely asleep, it completely kills your body's mood.   Imagine bouncing on a trampoline. To get high, you need to start off low and let gravity work with you so you can put more force on the trampoline and the trampoline gives back the force you put into it. And you can't just stop, you slowly start bouncing lower. So imagine you just stopped bouncing but you figured out you have thirty more minutes left to bounce. But once you start trying to jump high, the trampoline just tenses up and doesn't give you back any force and almost feels like solid ground. But... you were expecting to go through the entire cycle of bouncing higher and higher and higher. You still want to bounce higher, but the trampoline's timer said FUCK YOU and basically killed your happiness. It took away what you were looking forward to.  Sleep is somewhat the same way. When you start to go to sleep, your body looks forward to a certain amount of sleep, and when it doesn't get it, it keeps trying to go to sleep while you keep trying to stay awake.   Not that we want to play it in HD, because without a super powerful computer and an emulator and an adapter, PM will not be HD for real. Some of us just want to be able to play PM on Wii U because Wii U has much less lag with most flat screen TVs and it would take away the need to have a Wii *and* Wii U set up in a lot of households.   "Okay Google, where's the nearest Apple store with iPhones in stock?"   Well, would an emulator be able to connect to a legit pokebank to transfer to a retail cart? I'm using Gen 5 for RNG, and I figured being able to get onto the GTS would allow me access to many more Pokemon.   I wouldn't know the first thing about dumping my game's ROM   I've done all this. I just cannot verify that the code is correct. But nobody else has offered a code for comparison. (Pokemon black english)   They figured if they can run Microsoft dry of money, it'd be easier to compete againsts Microsoft's already pretty bad OSs.   I never used them in my cyber dragon decks. They never needed them. They didn't stall, they tried their damn best to speed up which leads to more consistent OTKs.   Wow. So many suckish monsters like Zwei and Larva. I'd comment further, but I'n tired. Remind me to expand on this in the morning.   Gosh. Maybe because there are millions more 360s than XBox ones.   Thx!   The script is all fucked up. Many blank pages. Can we get it fixed?   I get errors 20100 often, but those in the chat at raizo are telling me the servers are up. I've set the DNS correctly and have set the DNS correctly so many times I've memorized it.  I also get 52000 a lot which isn't listed on that page. Kind of wish that troubleshooting page was easier to see. I never even knew there was one.   "Oh Anna, if only there was someone out there who loves you."   red-rare Royal Tribute. Sold it once. I got it back by trading a card my girlfriend sent me. She got it for me the first time too. She basically got it for me twice.   "[This thing is happening] because of [thing that happened at this tournament]."  "[Insert card] shouldn't be banned. [deck it goes in] Isn't even doing anything right now, they need that card." This mostly applies to Stratos. Ever stop to think that maybe that fucking deck isn't doing anything because that ban-worthy card finally got hit?  "That card is totally getting banned."  "[this card] is gonna be OP, but [this other card] still needs to come out to make [this other deck] viable."  "Fucking hate YCS. Nothing but [cheaters/meta]"  Yeah, Yu-Gi-Oh Players say a lot of stupid and down-right retarded shit.   I've read that page. There doesn't seem to be anything in the way of a tutorial. I've got it somewhat figured out on my own, but there's more shit with error codes and not connecting even though the connection test was successful.   I'll let you know if those are still available after some other negotiations.   I'vve been using AR DSi and a bypass https code. That's not the problem.   Are there any good beginning to end tutorials on connecting to an alternate server. This is a retail game and I'm using a DSi game. I've gotten error code 52000, so I entered custom IP stuff and then it gave me error code 52100. I'm really not sure what's going wrong.  As is, my router is a Netgear, but it's using WPA so I'm using my iPhone to tether my DS to the router. If I try to change the WPA protection to WEP, I know of at least 5 people who will be pissed that their devices won't be able to connect.   I'm strapped for cash, and I really shouldn't be spending money on cards at all. Should be playing online for free like a poor man.  Somebody please make an offer for it all.  http://imgur.com/a/ePOJs   "Look buddy, my job is to try to sell you another computer and make it feel like it's all your fault, when in reality, all computers are vulnerable to attacks and it could be as simple as a deleted preference file making things so wrong.

"For my public speaking final presentation..."      I think NX articles should be banned from /r/Nintendo. So far every NX article has been "Nintendo seems to want to do [this]" or "Nintendo won't do [this] with the NX" according to some guy who isn't actually part of the project and is just speculating based on whatever. And, of course, we get the "The NX will need [this] if it wants to succeed" which mostly talk about how it better be a 3rd party whore or a straight-forward console with nothing but an ordinary controller. I just want to get it straight that Nintendo has not actually said anything about it other than it's an existing project. It's a fucking project. It's not a console yet. Right now, it's just an idea. Nothing is confirmed about the NX, and these articles are posting about it as if they have the insider on a console that's only months away from being announced.  Big news flash to the NX hypers: The NX can be anywhere from 2 to 6 to maybe even 8 years away. Right now, it's just a concept for Nintendo. I don't even think we were meant to know about it yet. Someone just slipped up and said a little too much, and now everybody can't stop fucking speculating on what they want the NX to be.  Let's ban nx articles from /r/nintendo and shut the fuck up about it until some REAL information is passed around. Right now, Nintendo needs our attention on the Wii U and the games coming to it.      "You wouldn't believe how uneventful this last hour has been."   And for my next trick, I will need a young female from the audience and about 9 months.   Exactly. I wish everyone would shut up about it. Nintendo doesn't even look like they wanted anyone to know. Something just happened to slip out and suddenly everyone is trying to predict it's release. NX could be 2 years away, or it could be 6. Time will tell.   I really wish we could all stop worrying about the NX and just let Nintendo do their thing.   If we have to give up backwards compatibility to get a beast-of-a-system, I kind of wouldn't mind. If they have the Wii U true backwards compatibility for GameCube titles, all I would need is a Wii U and whatever the NX will be. Oh, and my New 3DS but that's a minor technicality.   It's finally feeling like they have a new one.   Wow. It's unlike Microsoft to admit that their solution or software sucks. It's also unlike them to adopt any kind of standard.   Can we please get people to stop posting this? I've seen this a dozen times. It's old news.   "I am not having sex with you to keep my job."   Yeah, not sure what to say there.   I like this part about Nintendo. It's another thing I see as a difference between themselves and other companies. GTA 5 could have been GTA 15 since [it's the 15th game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Theft_Auto_(series)). The opening to Super Metroid admits to being Metroid 3 and Metroid Fusion says it's Metroid 4.  Mario Kart 7 could have just been named Mario Kart 2 and treated the rest of the games post Super Mario Kart as just spinoffs. This would have made Mario Kart 8 a Mario Kart 3 instead. And this would have pissed me off.  Why does it piss me off? I don't know, when other companies give their games the subtitle-spin-off treatment, it gets fans begging for that "give us game X". Like Kingdom Hearts fans begging for KH 3 when they've technically gotten much more than 3 games.  Naming conventions have never been nice in games. It sucks when every new game in a series is begging for confirmation on being a sequel or a prequel. And I guess at least I appreciate Nintendo's honesty with how many of a game they've released. (Except for Mario Party World Tour being the tenth Mario Party, not Mario Part 10).  Yeah, this is confusing. Yeah, I'm probably downvoted and banned for life, but I really just wanted to share this with someone.   "HO HO HO... MEEEERRY CHRISTMAS."   Lol. That's not even enough for 360x240.   I'm going to make this as detailed as possibly can so nobody here is confused and nobody can accuse me of being an idiot. So, as a prerequisite,   * YES, I HAVE GOOGLED THIS. YES,  * I HAVE TRIED THE SEARCH BAR OVER TO THE RIGHT.  * YES, I HAVE TRIES TO CONTACT APPLE FOR HELP, BUT THEY ALWAYS MAKE ME CALL THEM AND I CANNOT TROUBLESHOOT WHILE ON THE PHONE. * I keep iTunes updated. * This happens whether or not my phone is jailbroken.  Okay, now that we got that out of the way, let me get into the details. To keep this simple, let's just say I have 10 albums each with 10 songs. Sometimes, when I re-sync my iTunes to my iPhone, I encounter errors on plenty of songs. Or just some songs. Or almost all songs.  Here is the error as simply as I can think to explain it. And it's in example form.  Album 1 Song 5 plays until about 25 seconds in. At that point, it skips to the next song. But, if I play that song and scrub to 26 seconds or later, the rest of the song plays as normal.  How do I know it's not just a random error with only my phone? I've had this happen on an iPhone 4, and 2 iPhone 5s models. My brother has also said that it has happened when he had a 5 and it happens now while he has a 6. That's 5 phones spanning 4 models, so I'm sure it's not just bad sections on my own phone causing the problem. Apps and documents seem to work perfectly without any errors that would be caused on bad parts of storage.  So I've troubleshooted that much. Now, I sync quite often since I get a lot of music, and I write songs and rearrange playlists that I want to update and sync to my phone. So, I try to delete that individual song and sync again to see if it will sync back on properly. ... the song doesn't sync back onto the phone unless I delete the entire album.  So, in the prior example, if I delete Album 1 Song 5 and re-sync, Album 1 Song 5 is still missing. But, if I had deleted all of Album 2 because they all had problems, Album 2 will be copied back onto my phone while Album 1 Song 5 is still missing.  I have reported this bug to Apple multiple times. Unfortunately, they've NEVER gotten back to me about the issue.  If anybody else is having this issue, I urge you to speak up. If there's a lot of people with this problem but no apparent fix for it, I'm planning to send this thread to Apple.   *crowd says:* "An African-American sherrif"  *Other guy:* "Why not? It worked in 'Blazin Saddles'."   "HEY, I LOVE YOU, GET THE FUCK OVER HERE."   Reddit. Nobody knows our slogan is "The front page of the Internet."   Same here. It makes it much easier. I still don't seem to be hitting any seeds correctly though, which sucks. I can't just get something I hatch/catch right away to match anything on the sheet.   I've never had to use l or r for keypresses. I know my buttons work though. They work in the other games I play. Thanks for the help.  I'll try to recalibrate and see if I can get results again.   I AM still trying to get used to Chatot pitches. I just read a guide about them, so I'm trying to get used to them. Now I have a chatter with a constant tone to help with it.   I'm using a 3DS, pokemon black, english version. Calibrated everything step by step according to multiple guides. But, what sucks is that even if I don't get that shiny I want, when I catch the pokemon and check it out, it doesn't seem to match anything on the spread, meaning I didn't even hit my goddamn seed.  I'm holding the keypressed it tells me to. I'm pressing A to launch the game 8 seconds prior to the seed time. And... strangely enough, in getting all of the parameters, the actual seconds seems to fluctuate between a 7 second difference and an 8 second difference. Everything from Vcount to timer0 to gxstat to vframe all stays the same. On BOTH machines that I've tested which is a standard 3DS and New 3DS XL. (Yes, I have different profiles for each one.)  I'm using *RNG Reporter 9.96.6 Alpha, XP compatible* and mostly following Titan's guide to 5th gen abuse for stationary pokemon. The kicker is I've twice gotten a shiny Cobolion with incredible stats. Got it twice actually, but the first time I couldn't catch it, so I did extra preparation and got it again.  Now I'm trying to do it for Terrakion. I'm using chatter the same way I always have. Push up and down between the two and count the chatters. (I only recorded on one, but that changed the chatter for both Chatots, so I'm not sure if both of them count to push the frame forward.)  I have literally thought of everything, but it doesn't even seem to be timer0 trolling because my timer0 for both machines is 123C and I've gotten that more than 10 times in a row with the same machine, so it's pretty stable in that regard.  Date and time are synced up to my computer's clock. since there's a small delay when you press "ok" to set the time, I account for that and normally get my clocks synced within a quarter second or less.  I actually only tried my girlfriend's 3DS because I thought it might be a problem with my New 3DS being a bit faster. But, I got a shiny legendary on the New 3DS. I seeded that and moved forward correctly twice with the New 3DS. But now, the game just seems to troll me. And... I've tried multiple seeds to get Terrakion to be shiny.  I honestly cannot figure out what's going wrong.  If anyone would like to help me, maybe talk over skype or something to help out, that would be nice.   Yeah, I knew *when* to press the calculate button, but *when* i was pressing it, I had no goddamn clue why.  So you're saying, if I get a seed with a target frame and it calculates a starting frame much higher than that, the seed simply won't work? Well, that's bull crap.   I've tried to get a seed to use to breed for a shiny. One thing I don't understand is what the hell all these guides mean by the pitch of the chatots' chatter. Another is when I press "calculate Initial PIDRNG Frame". What is this for, and why does it sometimes give me an initial frame much higher than the target frame? What does it even mean?  I really don't understand why I'm supposed to press that button. And I've actually not been successful in getting a hatched egg to match anything on the sheet.  I really need help in clarifying a lot of this.  In case it helps, here is some of my results from the parameter finder:        TID            163       SID            46347     Actual Seconds 7, 7, 7, 8       VCount         8C       Timer0         123C       GxStat         6       VFrame         8     Seeds          0B20A8E780F3313C                    4910FA973BDFCB57                    4EBBD421F656D009                    D7D2BEEE423A5FFB  Every attempt was made at the top of each minute. For example, 2:20:00 or 4:53:00.  ---  Note, I've gotten this to work now. It took a lot of trial and error. I had to learn to get around the qwirks of using a 3DS. Chatot pitch education really helped. I've left my info here for my own future reference.   "What should I bring to the Club of People Who Can't Stand And/or Are Allergic to Cats?"   Thanks.   Thanks.   SID I'm assuming is secret ID. How am I supposed to provide my shiny value with just those? Unless SID is also my shiny value (which no guide ever said).   "And our next U.S. president will be..."   If you're good, I'll be using your pack for sure. Please don't disappoint.

    We just started sleep training on baby number two. It only took the little rock star 2 days to get in the habit. Sleeping from 10pm - 6am now its incredible. So incredible.   I totally get what you're saying. I started waking up early to practice mindfulness for a bit which I immediately follow with my hardest task for the day. Those are usually the tasks that require weird fits of creativity, like naming things :)   I've had one client this year ask about drupal, zero ask about symfony, laravel, zend, or expression engine, and about 100 ask about wordpress.    Someone worked really hard to build this, and it's visually beautiful, but I really hate navigating this way through content. Scrolling is slow and choppy, content I want to read zooms past and I have to scroll down again and there is no way to quickly scan through the content. Overall this type of design was a poor choice for this content in terms of the experience.         Always paper first. So fast.   Main quests also give you skill points as rewards after major sections.    Join a few guilds and ask your guild mates. Random public guilds I've joined have great communities of others willing to give dupes of recipes out.      I help small business with content strategy. If you would like some help let me know and we can chat.   A smarter way to learn JavaScript on Amazon is the best teaching book I've ever read. The graphic design of the cover isn't the best, and I'm definitely one who judges books by their cover, but the material inside is fantastic. I wish there were books written that way for everything.    Whatever they did sure is making my computer run slow on that site.   Those are great points!  I use toggl for time tracking and trello for lists / project management.                   When the game launched it was pretty easy to find them. You just logged out in a bank and logged back in to reloot all the chests and desks. 15 minutes I had every motif.         Services like shopify and squarespace are inexpensive, professional and easy to use.    Articles on medium.com have that. It's a pretty great feature.   [Source](http://www.azsmartoffice.com/articles/2015/top-5-things-productive-people-do-each-day)  We all want to get more things done in less time. With all the distractions we have each day that is an increasingly more difficult aspect of our careers to work on. After having a couple kids and taking on more work than ever before, here are the top 5 things I do each day to ensure maximum productivity and minimum insanity.  ##1. Stick to a Sleep Schedule We all know that sleep is important, but if you don't believe me you can see what the [Mayo Clinic in Scottsdale](http://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/adult-health/in-depth/sleep/art-20048379) has to say about sleep. Make sure you are setting a sleep schedule and sticking to it to ensure you are getting the right amount. Go to bed and wake up at the same time every day. That means weekends and holidays too. Many experts agree that [consistency is important](http://www.inc.com/eric-v-holtzclaw/consistency-power-success-rules.html), so make sure you are being consistent with your sleep habits. Being consistent reinforces your body's sleep-wake cycle and helps promote better sleep at night.   ##2. Pay Attention to Your Diet You literally are what you eat. food is fuel, and the kinds of foods and drinks you consume determine the types of nutrients in your system and impact how well your mind and body are able to function. That sugar and caffeine filled can might give you a quick short boost of energy, but is 15 minutes all the time you need? Try drinking a large glass of water first and see if that helps you feel better and wake up. [A symptom of dehydration is tiredness](http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/dehydration/basics/symptoms/con-20030056).  ##3. Focus Your Mind Meditation is not a luxury like a reflexology foot massage. Its a way to disconnect from everyday stresses, if only for a few minutes a day. You deserve to feel good, to have the energy you want to enjoy life, to be healthy and happy. Start living the life you were meant to live. Learn to meditate.  Dr. Marcia Hootman  There are [many benefits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research_on_meditation) that come when you take the time to practice some sort of meditation, from increased focus to more happieness. It is understandable to be afraid of somethign you haven't tried before, especially something as personal as meditation. Being quiet and alone with yourself can be scary, it's one of the reasons why our society is so obsessed with technology, entertainment and distractions. We are afraid of our true selves. Once you are able to build up the will power to overcome that fear you will put yourself on a path to greater mental focus and productivity.  Reddit has many great resources like r/mindfulness and r/meditation if you want to learn more.  ##4. Set Goals  By [setting goals](http://www.codeofliving.com/articles/5-powerful-reasons-why-goal-setting-important) we give ourselves focus and a way to measure our progress during the day. Having daily goals is a great way to remain undistracted, help us overcome procrastination and motivate us to succeed.  Goals are what take us forward in life; they are the oxygen to our dreams. They are the first steps to every journey we take and are also our last. Its very important that you realize the significance and importance of goal-setting and apply this knowledge in your life."  ##5. Make Email More Productive Ever been overwhelmed by emails at work? Experts report billions of emails are sent every day and they're still increasing. With so many messages arriving throughout the day, email can easily become a continual interruption and distraction from getting real work accomplished. Try some useful tips like scheduling time for email and only working on them during that specified time, use the subject line only for quick messages, and replace large Word and PowerPoint file attachments with PDFs.  Our work and our lives are better when we are more productive, less stressed and able to use our time more effectively. By setting a consistent sleep schedule, maintaining a healthy diet, exploring meditation and your own mind, taking the time to set and track goals and finding better ways to manage your email you will be on a path to a more productive life. I'm not saying that these things won't take practice and some work on your part, but the reward is well worth the effort involved.         As long as you're willing to continue learning and put in real work and effort, anything is possible. Even doing your own SEO.  There are lots of fun things to learn to be good at SEO. Skills like research, strategizing, writing, reputation management, networking, web design and more. The sidebar of this subreddit has lots of great resources. Moz has a ton of great stuff on their blog as does searchengineland.   The benefits of hiring a professional are the same as with any job or task. If you hire someone who knows what they are doing, who will create a marketing strategy for you with a way to measure results and tweak your plan, you will hit the ground running and benefit from the professional's many years of experience and expertise.    As du5t said, UX is all of those things. I have an example I will put together in a behance project for you to see. It's one I did for fun that took a few weeks that goes through the entire process.   As for what you can do as a college student to help your career, this one is actually pretty simple. Design stuff. Lots of stuff. Stuff you don't get paid to do, stuff you think would be fun to work on.      What I mean by 'design an alternative to reddit' is that I would like to get an understanding of what members of the community find valuable and what they would improve upon and use that information to design a bunch of different ideas to test with some low-fi mockups and prototypes. Monetization is part of any business and will be a fun component to look at more in depth.       Thanks for the informative reply. I've fixed the problems and I'll remember them in the future :)   Reading slower and reading for enjoyment help me remember.            No thank you. I've been meaning to try out some Taylor Swift in my working music routine. I'll give her a try today.   Having experienced most of these things myself I have to say that this is a pretty spot on article.   The part that really got me was:  "When those days come, flex your freelance muscles and get away from the desk. Exercise. Be with people you care about. Play a video game."  You know when you're going to have a tough day, and remembering not to beat yourself up about it is so important. It's tough having a growth mindset all the time, thanks for the reminder :)      Good job keeping up with the practice!  	43

Unfortunately, Im at work and these official papers are all I have at the moment, but I thought Id write to you now, while Ive still got it in my head. My [memorys](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/3dnc2l/wellspring/) been kind of weird lately. Sometimes I have trouble recognizing my driveway. But Im not writing to bitch about my troubles. Not this time, anyway. I know you mentioned a piece of [evidence](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/3dr8qk/languish/) to a weird case going missing. We found something similar on our end. I dont think its the exact same as yours, but it seems similar and sort of follows the same pattern. I thought Id send it to you, just in case. It looks like most of the pages have been ripped out.  Its almost exciting. Nothing happens here. Im sure youll get a call from me before you receive this, so we can talk about our normal man shit, haha. Did I used to wear blue a lot? Whens dinner? Do you think we all go somewhere after we die? I dont think so. I think we just sink into the dark, deep ground, and sink and sink and sink and sink  Shit, you caught me babbling and my boss just got here. Ill hurry up and send this before he jumps down my throat. Also, for whatever reason, the first page of the book has Wasps nest written on it, but in a different handwriting than the rest. Im sure youll get a kick out of that.  Sincerely,   Adam  *****  *February 13th, 2013*  Im finally moved in! Addy seems to be a decent roommate so far. Shes pretty clean and gives me space when I need it. Cant say much more than that.  Its still taking a while to get used to. I miss the wide open fields. The smell of the desert on my hands. [Coyotes](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/3dwcp3/satiation/) in the night. Every star gleaming and glittering right in my backyard. The quiet, the peace, the solitude. Here, in this apartment, there is always noise. The washer and dryer might as well be stereos. Our neighbors run their own loud schedule, disregarding social etiquette. Sirens and horns and shouts are constant. It makes you appreciate those tiny moments - the white noise of the shower running, long car drives, cozy blankets. And I feel so silly for being bothered by living in the city because its still pretty far from what I imagine city life to be. For instance, I had to take a different route home because a cow got in the road and was blocking traffic.  Its still weird to call this place home. I think once I have my own space, itll feel more natural. Right now I share a bed with Addy because its better than the couch and she doesnt mind. Its the first time, outside of sleepovers, that Ive regularly shared a bed with someone. I dont necessarily mind it.   nbsp;  *March 3rd, 2013*  My life is just about as busy as I expected it to be. But there are a lot of things I didnt expect.  Sometimes I wake in the middle of the night and see Addy sleeping so close to me, her face pressed up close, her breathing steady. Shes certainly the least cynical person I know, but she must carry a certain burden during her waking hours, because I have never seen her face so relaxed and sweet.   Im learning to play the cello again. I feel like when I sit on my balcony, amidst all the noise, and begin to play, everything just sort of...turns off. I like that.  Weve been going hiking lately and always find cool little trinkets. I like to keep them on our windowsill.   nbsp;  *April 15th, 2013*  I wonder if I can officially call Addy my girlfriend yet. I dont think you can until the other person agrees to. It makes me wonder quite a bit what she considers us.   I would ask her, but the way Addy is, I feel like she would just tell me. I could feel us growing closer as the weeks passed, both physically and mentally. We started preferring each others company to our own friends. I was making good money but buying my own bed never crossed my mind. And one night, we just started kissing. We still do, occasionally.  I dont know why Im afraid to ask. I shouldnt be, right?   nbsp;  *April 26th, 2013*  We found something in the woods somewhere  Never mind. I cant write it out. Im too scared. We cant bring it home.   nbsp;  *May 23rd, 2013*  12:55 AM Saw it crawling from the shadow in the corner. Lots of teeth. Shaking. I think it said my name, but Ive never heard it spoken like that before.   12:58 AM. I dont remember writing that. I dont remember that event. Heading back to the bathroom.  1:02 AM I dont know where I am, I can feel tile but everything looks like my old home, and I cant get up but I hear my mom and dad and I see it crawling, going towards them, and then it sees me and smiles  1:05 AM. Felt nauseous after that last one. Still dont know what I was talking about but I get a headache every time I try to remember.  1:07 AM its behind me, it breathes downs my neck and I want to turn around but I feel like if I keep writing, I might make it out alive, I just have to pretend  1:45 AM. Addy said I was passed out. She said I wouldnt respond but my eyes were wide open and I looked so afraid. After she held me for a while I fell asleep. I just woke up a few minutes ago.   Its official, we cannot be alone for more than a few minutes. Well have to do a few more experiments to find the exact time. Addy wants me to stop, but I want to figure this out.   nbsp;  *June 5th, 2013*   We have to leave, I dont   nbsp;  *July 3rd, 2013*  We are on the run. I dont want to say where because I feel like it can still connect to us [somewhere](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/3e0tmg/inveigle/). Were trying to find out how this is happening. We want to know if it can be fixed.  Ive never seen Addy so serious. I feel like shes been through this before, but as usual, Im too afraid to ask.    nbsp;  *August 7th, 2013*  DONT LOOK AT ME PLEASE PLEASE JUST DONT PLEASE   nbsp;  *September 1st, 2013*  Im sorry, Addy.   If you somehow find my next journal, youll know where to find this. I hope it didnt burn too badly. I took out the more embarrassing, horrible entries a long time ago, but I realized afterwards there wasnt much left. Maybe youll find those, too. I havent decided if Ill destroy them yet.  You were everything to me. And maybe I was to you, but I dont care about that. I just want to make sure youll be okay, with or without me.  I have a distinct feeling that we wont make it out of this alive or in one piece. I know youve been trying to convince me to go back to the forest with you, but Ive been procrastinating because I want to make sure things are set.   Can you do something for me, please? Just for a moment? I want you to think of every good memory you have of me before you read on. I think itll be the last time you truly love me. Just trust me.  I wasnt totally honest with you when I said I wasnt a religious person. I think I always have been, until pretty recently. And I think that little thing that humans have, that thing youre always talking about that ties in with faith, is what got us here.  Theres more to that, and I might add more if I have time. I think youll wake from a nightmare any moment now. But know that when we leave, everything will have been set. Im going to try to make sure that one of us gets out of this alive, even if that isnt me. I made a pretty good bargain, and I think theyll be satisfied.   I just dont know what theyll do to you, but at least youll be alive, and if I know you well, I think youll regain your own independence eventually. By then, youll probably have found this. Youre smart like that.  I dont know much about them, but I know theyre better than whatever watches us in the dark. I know youll find a way out.  Please remember me through your amber glasses. I think I liked myself best when you loved me.   nbsp;  [THGILEHTEESLLIWUOY](https://www.reddit.com/user/test_subject1381)  	2
 Oh I have the annoying part down alright don't worry! I think I will grab an envelope and stamp tomorrow and do that, it sounds like a really nice idea, thank you so much!   Found some but most are around 40 an hour is there any better options you guys know?   Hi guys, so a couple months ago my girlfriend was diagnosed with depression and it's been really hard for her she moved away from her family to the uk to study and has not made any friends since september, she still does have alot of friends back home but she doesn't call them much.  Basically what i posted this for was how i can help her, i live about 3 hours away from her and i was staying with her since she was diagnosed but recently i've had to go back home for certain reasons and she's having a really tough time she's telling me she's so lonely, i call her but she's so quiet and won't talk, i miss her so much i feel terrible being away from her, i can't visit her due to money problems atm and i want to be able to support her and help her get through this while being away, i love her so much and i'm so lost i hate seeing her like this so what things can i do to help her through this tough time while i'm away i'll do anything to make her feel better.   So basically titan fall then?   This gives me hope for rangers pet AI in HoT   and Revenant.   Cripple isn't supposed to be fun!   Love the work but I don't really see any legs on this charr what happened there?   A lot of talk about sand has me thinking, they added silky sand to the PvP rewards, maybe we'll use silky sand to help rebuild lions arch??? Just an idea.   Ah thank you for the quick reply, so how much FPS should i expect to get myself 30ish?   I know exactly what the problem I have been the exact same way with my girlfriend and one point, the problem for me was just one day I started lasting less and less and it really damaged my confidence, I didn't really want to have sex as I know it would end in disappointment for her and I got no enjoyment out of cumming anymore as it just made me feel guilty, after that if my girlfriend started to tease me or try to kiss me with tongue I'd try to tone it down and make it less sexual as I was scared that it would lead to sex which would lead to disappointment again, I didn't want that feeling so I didn't want sex.  I don't have the answer to this problem but I don't think you should listen to the guys here saying "He's lost interest" that's exactly what my girlfriend thought about me, ASK HIM ABOUT IT! Only he can tell you for sure it helps to not make him feel pressured into having sex be patient and talk to him.  Feel free to send me a message if you wanna talk about anything.   I'm sure it's been talked about in the official forums and been commented on by one dev about making it aoe around the target, not sure tho i'll have a look for it!   What build are you using here i'd love to try it out in some pvp matches, flaming axe is the spice of life!  edit: nvm figured it out 6/2/0/2/4   Wyrms and Wyvern's are different kinds of dragons one's that the elder dragons are not styled upon, they are simply dragons, thus the "Dragonhunter"   Dragon Hunter probably.   I've played guardian since the start as my main and mostly PvP don't care about pve, and I for one am excited I don't understand your disappointment.   Personally I love the name but I don't think they will change the name because they may have already used the name in the dialog of the story if the braham picking up eir's longbow idea comes true, they would have to get the voice actors back in and change it and that cost money and time which I'm sure a net don't want to spare right now with working on the expansion.   I feel a good solution to this would to be to force New PvP players rank 1-3 perhaps to all play in the same games and not give them an option for hotjoin, unranked and ranked until reaching rank 3, maybe forcing them is a bit much and instead create a seperate queue for only ranks 1-3, this could give people some much needed practice against people who are also new to PvP and eliminates any higher ranked and skilled players from dominating and scaring away the new players.   Oh shit, here come the theorists, could be quite interesting    Make sure you load your emails from "All time" most of the time when i "lose" an old email it's because it's really old and my email is only set to sync emails from the past 3 months!    Almost indistinguishable; you know apart from the fact they have letters telling you which is which.   If you guys haven't noticed anyone who participated in the beta few weeks ago gets a heroic chest!   So does this mean guardian will be the specialization getting all the shouts!?  	23
   At first, I would like to say that this is a real story. I am now 17y old, and don't live in that house anymore.    I was that ''disturbed'' kind of kid, you know? Had many fears, and always had that feeling that at any time, when I close my eyes at night, the monster in my closet would come to get me. Plus, I lived my entire childhood, and part of my adolescence in my parents' house, a pretty big house I would say, located in the countryside of my state. That house was quite... disturbing. Lots of unused rooms, a big courtyard, almost like a forest, and at night, that place would adopt a profound and eerie silence. That house, in my child's mind, haunted me. I suffered a lot from nightmares, the majority of them involved the house itself. Something very deep inside that big old house tortured me psychologically, especially at night. For all those reasons, as a child, I would only sleep if I was completely under the covers. Some events happened in that house by the time I was living there, and this is what I will relate to you.    As a kid who loved to stay up late, skype with friends and this kind of shit, and then hear footsteps outside my door, and go and see what caused it, finding just an old quiet empty house, turned to be a customary event. The fist time something really eerie happened, I was having dinner with my family (dad, mom and older brother).     As usual, I was the first to finish the meal and did not hesitate to go to my room after it. On the way, when I was near a turn, that would lead me to my room, I felt an enormous fear possessing my body when I heard the unmistakable sound of footsteps coming from the room that I would end up entering. I turned pale as I ran out of action, there was no one in the house except my family who were still in the dining room behind me. I waited motionless, with a scream stuck in my throat, steps before the turn that would lead me to that room. I felt a breathe of cold air. The steps were getting closer to the turn. The light of this room I was about to enter was on and I could clearly see a shadow approaching, in short steps. Seeing that shadow, I could not take it anymore and ran to the kitchen, only to find my family with perplexed and confused looks. I sat in a chair, and could not speak; I remember my father asking me what had happened, but I was breathless. All I could say was that there is something in the house. My father and my brother rushed to see if they could find whatever that was, but they couldn't. ''You're imagining things.'' my father said to me, with a hard look. But I know what I saw; After that, I checked all the rooms in the house by myself, only to find nothing. This experience messed me up a bit, but what happened a few years later was what made me conclude that there is something in my parents house who do not want to be disturbed. ____________________________________________________________________________________________    Fast-forward three years. I was living in an universitary town of my state and not longer with my parents, which I visited on a weekly-based. At this time I had a musical group in my hometown, and whenever we could, on weekends I was there, we gathered in to make some noise and have fun. I was therefore going back to my parents' house after one of those meetings that went late into the night. I was not drunk or in any other state that would delegitimize this story. When entering the house (I had the key), it was nearly 3AM. Everyone was sleeping, and I know that because I always check if I woke up anyone when I come home after those late meetings. Tired, I put some pajamas and lay on the bed; But sleep would not come. Something was not right that particullarly quiet night. I browsed on reddit for at least 20 minutes, and when I was done doing that, I put off my cell phone and just tried to think about my life, patiently waiting for the sleep to come.     A brief explanation of how my parents' house is structured: there is a part of it where you can find the rooms for the children;  I sleep in one room, and my brother in another. Our rooms are very close, almost side by side. My parents have their own room, whis is quite far from ours, and the house continues with a lounge, and lots of other rooms, which I have already spoken that some are abandoned. The event that took place that morning haunts me to this day;    Lying in bed, still awake, I heard the TANGIBLE sound of something  running very fast, like the sound of feet hitting the ground, at a great speed. It came from the back of the house, towards me. It passed in front of my door, still running, entered my brother's room and got on his bed (remembering that I have found my brother in a deep sleep when I came to check if I woke him). What you feel at this time is difficult to explain. You enter a mixed state of panic and alert; The silence that ensued after that was absolute. At this time, any noise I hear I would shit myself. My mind was divided into entering the my brother's room and face whatever it was entered there, or lie motionless on my bed, pretending to be asleep. The longest 30 seconds of my life just passed, as I am motionless in my bed, trying to reason what the fuck has just done that. In my room, there is a mosquito net on the door, which is used to prevent mosquitoes to enter the room. It was balancing. Proving so that something ran in front of it. Fear had fully possessed my body, then something happened that broke the silence.   My brother started screaming. I'm not saying startled cries of surprise, but *panic screams*. Right now, confused in my thoughts, I jumped out of my bed and decided to enter his room and face whatever it is. The door was ajar. It was not that way. When I opened it, and take the first step inside his room, I felt something I can't explain. A very bad feeling, kind of a negative vibe was taken the room. It's hard to explain with words what I felt as I entered in there. My brother was lying all wrong in his bed, his legs crossed, head to the side. His two hands were near his mouth, fingers were moving up, flicking his lips in a continuous move. There was nothing else in the room. But that scene marked me forever. I was at least one minute standing there, trying to calm down of the situation that I had recently witnessed. Then, all of suddenly, my brother woke up. He looked at me with a puzzled look and asked what was going on. I said nothing, only that he should go back to sleep. And so he did. I was up til '6AM, so the sun would come and give me the least hope I was safe, and that it was over. I never told anyone about this.   Today I live in the capital of this state, nearly 600 km from my small hometown. I visit my parents almost once in two months. My brother also do not live there anymore and we see each other very rarely. I have a few other weird stories about that house that I can share up here, but the post is getting too long; hope you'd like. Sorry for the bad english, not my natural language!  Cheers, LS.     If that little dress is from a... idk, dead child, then it would explain why Molly had those ''childish actions'', like following the tractor and shit. Pretty creepy!      Just wanted to highlight the [shovel version] (https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=oeb5LdAyLC8)   I noticed this when I saw that this post: https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/3cucye/an_old_team_at_reddit/ was up to 20000 upvotes, and now it is with roughly 6000 thousand. Why this happen?   Doves!   That's right, the smaller one (:   Why the fuck my dad would stack these birds?! He found this scene in the wild, while he was photograhing other birds. The bigger one (male) is alive, and no one ever said this is an edited scene, it is natural.   They are the same species. The reason they look slightly different is that they are male and female.      Little background...  my dad is an ornithologist and photographer. Here's a sad picture he took of these two lovers.

 Makes me wonder what effect the freon   kerosene spill had on the ecosystem. I guess it was diluted to insignificance.      What does it feel like to be old? Which parts of the body ache, fail and change? How do you best take care of them to limit their deterioration?   Move to Australia. They come and eat bananas from our hands, lick cuddle and sleep. We throw them outside if they bark.   I gave up smell and fragrant foods like curries remained delicious. Wine tastes good but definitely lacks a component.   Marinate meat before you go.  If hiking eat the perishables (steak and eggs) early and long term hikers sharing your campsite on will hate you.  	6

No no, Jenny only did besos.   TBH, Ive lived under noisy neighbours and it does get your blood boiling also add the fact that this family is grieving I can somehow understand where she is coming from. The racist remarks of course make her lose all validity in her argument however she is from a different time, it's hard to change.

I was more interested in who did 911. Last I heard is was some band named Jet Fuel.   Fiestaaa!!   He's a shittier English version of Remi Gallard.   I did this once as well, got stuck in the save for most of the day.   What's worse is that the only reason this has come to light is because of the Andres Iniesta Instagram account thing that happened over the weekend.

But hey what do I know right? Im just a stranger on the internet with a different with an outside perspective at the comedy show you call health care.   Anyone can go to a hospital in Cuba and get treated for free, by better i mean better in a real world sense, not on spreadsheets and charts.    What the point if no one can afford it? The rest of the world really appreciates it though!    RemindMe! 2 days Donation for /r/millionairemakers WOHOOO!!   YOu guys really claim to have the best healthcare in the world? That's the most deluded statement I've heard in a while. Come to Europe and see how the real best healthcare in the world works. I never have to deal with the hospital in a financial sense. If I break, they fix me, job done. When do I pay? I've been paying my taxes since I turned 18, there's my contribution.    This shit really sounds crazy. How can a 1st world country have a health system that's so broken? Cuba has a better health system than America.   Guy Fawkes was killed. This is a new guy.

I think UK when I see sterling too. Same with dollars everyone thinks US but you also have Australia and Canada etc .Although they're technically different currencies as they have different value. Then again however you have the Scottish pound which is less than and English pound.     Money is weird concept.      I don't live in the UK I live in Gibraltar. Alcohol and Tobacco are really cheap here (surprisingly though there are very few alcoholics). On the other hand our food prices are pretty high when you compare our Morrisons to one in the UK.   Same here, the only thing I hate is that it's only every other COD game which has it.

Not only that. They were waiting for the cops to arrive to give the description of the bike that was stolen, he was probably confused as to why he was seeing the ends off two barrels. I know I would be, but then again I live in a place where cops don't carry guns and somehow still manage to do their job efficiently so what do I know.   Rubber bullets. They're obviously not mentally skilled enough to acknowledge a situation where lethal force is necessary so it should be removed all together.     Mucho thank you!   I had no idea things were this bad in America. wow.   I still can't say it.   I'm currently trying this, had a setback in a small festival this past weekend but not gonna let it deter me. There's another small outdoor festival this weekend so going to just forget this past weekend and hope for the best this coming one. It's tough but it's got to be done.   Where is season 2 being aired?? ITV aren't doing it anymore and it's driving me crazy trying to find it.   Maybe he was just trying to show how he can crash too?   In my country I pay around 20% Tax in my monthly income (single no kids). I can go to the hospital for anything with no problem and if they don't have the equipment required for a certain operation/test one of our neighbouring countries will put you in their hospital which the Government will pay for. It's a good life, can't complain.   Never thought of that. Will give that a go later. Thanks!      https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blpe_sGnnP4   This is why we can't have anything nice.   No no, didn't you know these are warehouse turtles? They look similar to forest turtles and are very identical in almost every way except that the warehouse turtle only live in Chinese Warehouses, silly western man.   TIL I have no original thoughts.   I'm white and don't even live in america yet this was childhood.   I don't mean make it only work via headset but when the headset is plugged in it could use the headset instead of it's internal mic to pick up voice commands. It would be a lot easier for the user to give the command and for the console to hear it. The camera in the kinect is still used of course to identify the person giving the commands.   It';s just a small thing that will make the experience a lot nicer. People wouldn't have to be shouting across their living room, instead they could speak into they're mic.    Edit: thanks for the downvotes guys. #progress.   So for people who use the Kinect, they know that when the TV is a bit too loud the Kinect cannot hear you, which is understandable.   My solution is simple and could be done with a software update. Allow Kinect to hear your commands via the headset.   I would make the Kinect user experience a lot more tolerable, as a lot of people enjoy blasting game volume to get immersed and not being able to use the Kinect properly when doing this can ruin a game if Kinect commands are allowed within the game.   It's a small thing I know but it's a small thing that will make the console feel a lot more responsive.   Uppity Bitch....I like.   Whoever topples it has to take care of it!   Sweeeet.

I see myself getting a PC quite soon tbh, see what all the hype is about!   For a long while now I've been wanting Xbox to make multi-screen a feature on it's console. [This latest image I've seen](https://i.imgur.com/HJ0QMju.jpg) makes me want it even more.   nbsp;  Now I'm not sure about the capabilities of Windows 10 on Xbox One but is this something that could be done? Or is it more on the hardware side of things? Maybe an official Xbox multi-screen HDMI splitter?   nbsp;  I'm just brainstorming ideas, but if anyone has any info on the matter it would be much appreciated.   nbsp;  Edit: Damn. Thanks for the info guys!   The Captain heard the protest     from this "pitiful pile of waste"   Line him up against that wall   And with his life, make haste.   nbsp;   ^^^^Too ^^^Dark?    Well that's just like your opinion I guess.   If his story is true (which tbh is believable compared to other stories on the internet) then he got screwed over by bad/ negligent customer service and Gamestop should correct that.   But then again, that's just like my opinion I guess.     OP is just looking for his Xboxone. Let him be I say and good luck!   It's not more than a random gust of strong wind at the beach. If you someone managed to get stabbed I think it was Darwin's doing.   Searched competitive larping. So disappointed.   Can't adjust the lighting though.   Kick him in the head.   The fish at the beginning is not the same one that gets eaten. Seems like a different place ll together.   [Relevant near the end](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08c0BXTVpfs)   That's why we ended up doing 2 player on each TV. On four players it would crash and an error code would appear (don't remember the message it gave but it was pretty random)and that's not what you want happening when you're trying to do the story.   This is the only reason I will be getting it. Zombies is the most fun couch co-op you can have!!   I believe this one will only be 2 player split screen though. Thankfully that's how my friends and I play. LAN party woohoo!!!   I was actually planning on getting a mini fridge for my room but I don't want to go back on my never pre-order rule. Decisions!   I thought the same at the beginning but the game play demos have got me curios. I'll wait a couple of weeks after release to see reviews etc and make an informed decision.   That's an awesome pic. Wish I had some friends that were into this type of thing. Luck cunt!   Well it's got one thing right in that PC Gamers are mostly alone. **BRING ON THE DOWNVOTES**   I'm not religious but I like this man. Finally some one who actually seems to be in touch with the real world instead of the make believe one we have created for ourselves.   Edit: Any reason why I've been downvoted fro saying I like him other than you guys being assholes?. Didn't think so.  	117

          The World /Shudders      Reduced interest rates will be more likely.   Here you go:  https://www.kildarestreet.com/debates/?id=2015-02-10a.416  Please donate to Kildare Street if you can, it's the only track record that we really have!   A lot of those costs are fictions from those who stand to benefit from them, the rest will be much more affordable soon.   Check the markets' response to Christine Lagarde's press conference tomorrow.   Affordability may look very different tomorrow morning, and the troika's conditions on Ireland will be the least of their worries.   Cheers for that, though it's a directive to improve:  conditional upon the ability of the member state to demonstrate that the non-charging for water services does not compromise the purposes and objectives of the Directive  Or to put it another way, we don't have to charge if we can fix it otherwise.  We're not **obliged** to impose charges, we're obliged to impose **changes**.  'Technically correct' it may be, but nevertheless we are still not obliged to charge for domestic water.  We are certainly not obliged to spend over ~1 billions in Euros putting in meters rather than repairs.   Yes we do, the exemption is straightforward.  You'll have my absolute sympathies for not trusting Irish Water when they, themselves, confirm this to be the case - but it's the case nonetheless.   Ah, the ISIF's contribution wouldn't count then?   Just before you do buy one:  http://bgr.com/2013/11/20/lg-smart-tv-spying/    Your OS will load after this brief ad.   Oh man, that's it!  Can someone re-colour her top to Umbridge-pink?   "They've changed something["](https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage v=z_KmNZNT5xw#t=15)   I reckon there's still a bit of nervousness about that.  There's a ruling due in [April](http://www.irishtimes.com/news/politics/what-is-the-eu-test-on-irish-water-about-1.2010287) and if Irish Water doesn't pass it - then all Irish Water's spending goes back on the government balance sheet.  This injection of investment might have a role there.   And heels   Aye, it will be Dob-Uisce.   That was very refreshing.   "Life is full of suffering" she says with a smile and something like a giggle.  What is wrong with her? Does she know nobody who has been in that situation?  Then conflating the situation of an unviable foetus with that of an adult who has a terminal illness.  Is 'terminal category collapse' a known psychological malady?  I hope she suffers when there's nobody around to give her a Seanad seat.  Not that she'll suffer train fares or anything.       Cash only, and bring-your-own-gimp ;)   Would you like that?   I don't think a refusal to listen to Enda has to fall into either category, or the many variations in-between.   Probably the "if" part   So are all school students either knacker-drinkers or swotty-squares to you?   Though we have an exemption from charging for domestic water under that directive:  http://www.water.ie/help-centre/questions-and-answers/does-ireland-have-an-exem/    And here's Alan Kelly in direct contradiction of that:  ["But constitutionally, I cant stand here and **vote** for something that I know to be unconstitutional. In fact, it would be against the constitution to do that.](http://www.broadsheet.ie/2015/02/11/gel-hath-no-fury/)  Looks like the crib sheets didn't go out in time.   This is bizarre, you've just made the same mistake again.  Can you provide me with your definition of 'political policing'?  So far you seem to think that it is impossible for a police force to be independent of politicians   their motives.   Great idea, and the drone could be controlled from the viewing platform at the top.  http://www.buildingsofireland.ie/niah/search.jsp?type=record county=ME regno=14401601  Then a quick spin over to the Round Tower in the town.  I wonder could the drone be piloted from the lower door of the Tower, then up inside and out at the top?      Your line of reasoning is based on a redefinition of what 'political policing' means.  Your redefinition isn't even close.  Our constitution separates the powers of politics and the powers of policing from each other.  http://www.supremecourt.ie/supremecourt/sclibrary3.nsf/pagecurrent/D5F78352A387D74480257315005A419E?opendocument l=en  Your attitude is much closer to 'Fuck Democracy' than the comment you're replying to. That comment is in actual support of Democracy.  Have you lost basic sense?    Super-soon   Knew a girl from Yorkshire and she thought the exact opposite.  And then there was 'vase'   Sweet jebus, I need to go to the shops now.   So if I don't download eOS   I don't contribute to them, I am not a 'cheater' and I'll still have money to donate to the core projects   code that eOS itself relies on.  Therefore, I better donate to all the others because if they were to go belly-up eOS wouldn't have a project to work on at all.  Hmmm, this decision is getting easier.     If only the violent thugs in my area got this treatment.  The only dawn raids the Garda do in my town is for breakfast rolls.   Between 2007 and 2013, 7 in every 10 specimens examined by the Bureau tested positive for drugs.  Does anyone know where I can get the data up to 2013?  I've found the data up to 2011: http://www.ucd.ie/t4cms/MBRS%20Roadside%20Drug%20Testing%20Report.pdf, but not further.  The detection rates of Cocaine coincides very well with the Celtic Tiger era and afterwards.     This lad is a clown.  I will selectively target his on-record statements as a demonstration of his clownhood, though there are many more and selectivity isn't really necessary:  ["People are very apprehensive after six years of hardship. They are tired of charges and **that mood is being exploited by the same people who gave you the anti-bin charges protests**, Rabbitte said. And **remember where the anti-bin charges protests led to   it led the privatisation of the bin services** and it led to people not being able to pay.](http://www.thejournal.ie/irish-water-pat-rabbitte-1754730-Oct2014/)  The privatisation of bin charges (this was in Dublin) were due to the use of a veto by the then chair of Dublin City Council.  That chair was held by [John Tierney](http://www.broadsheet.ie/2014/01/21/ever-bin-had/)  If the name rings a bell, it's because he is now of charge of Irish Water.  So according to Pat don't protest Irish Water because that might precipitate privatisation and the guy who did that to the bins is now in charge of Irish Water. Hardly the argument of someone who knows what he's talking about.     I guess there was an effort at creating a distinction rather than a new meaning, but I don't think our Department is doing a good job lately of administering justice.     Ok, just to dispel some of the "that's bullshit" ideas - hypnotism does actually work.  It cannot make you do things very outside your moral range, e.g. murder, though it can make you do things that you'd consider doing if you were drunk for instance.  It induces a very relaxed state of mind, if you refuse a suggestion then that relaxed state is broken and you're back to normal. Hence, people often follow the suggestions to keep the relaxed state. That's the ELI5 of it.  As to, 'should I partake in stage hypnosis' - no you shouldn't.  It's often very embarrassing after the fact, can cause major sleep pattern disturbance and is best left to people who are qualified in it and have a medical professional reputation to lose if they screw up.  There are many anecdotal and some serious investigations into bad outcomes days afterwards in otherwise healthy people.  As a technical definition, falling asleep can be considered self-hypnosis.  Don't let someone (unqualified) mess around with something essential to your brain's healthy routines.      It notes that Irelands reputation has been slipping with Transparency International **placing it at its lowest ever ranking** among the business community two years ago at 25th, behind Uruguay, Chile and the Bahamas.  If only this were surprising.  It makes 11 recommendations to the Government and has asked it to report in 18 months on the steps it has taken to implement the recommendations.  So a problem for the next government, and probably not a problem at all - as it won't be acted on.     True, does flow better.  Though I think Department sounds more like our lot.  Ministry implies some sort of over-arching concern or ideal that I'm not sure our Department has.     Ministry of Justice  Didn't know we had a ministry for that.   Shatter said most of the public agree constitutional change is needed in this regard, adding that he hopes Fine Gael will include a commitment to holding a referendum on the issue in its General Election Manifesto.  This is not the shit-stirring I was looking for.      Which is great, I hope I get one in Ireland when that happens.   That's a pity. I probably sound like a stuck record on this board, but I'm with Digiweb and have next to no problems with them. They're honest when support questions are out of their range too.  Probably time for ComReg, a new Router and / or internet-shaming.   I really want to try one of these, but having an 'appointment' window to do so seems either bull-headed or even a little suspicious.  Are they nervous of selling all their stock too quickly, running up a production line only to be left with unsold stock, being exposed as a sub-par device, or do people have to be 'current' enough to know how to get them   thus create some kind of artificial 'cachet' for them?  I reckon the way to sell these needs to be a bit more like an R-Pi or Odroid.  Sure they're kind of niche for a while then let them grow via their communities.  Not gate the opportunity to simply try them. I really want a genuine Linux phone to succeed - just let me buy one when I've the cash. Don't tell me when to have the cash ready.   They'll have bored each other to death before they roll up their sleeves.   Definitely get a new router by pestering UPC (better option) or buying one yourself and getting UPC to walk you through the settings.  Rebooting routers can be a slow-failure or even a hack. Plus they're not so expensive that UPC won't capitulate if you say you'll leave. Also, twitter   boards.ie for internet shaming if the above doesn't work.      Dil ireann does more harm to Irish people than anything else does.      They will, but if the alternative is a repeat of the last 5 years - it mightn't look any worse. Who knows, a cheap Drachma would be a huge boost to tourism.  Plus they'll get to control their own currency which everyone else in the eurozone won't get - they'll get the fallout minus a say in currency.   I reckon they'll eventually be forced to accept a deal, otherwise Greece will say they have to leave the Euro due to German intransigence.  If that then becomes Spain, Portugal   Italy leaving the Euro, Germany will be accused of scoring a major own goal. Especially if it looks like they dragged their heels to appease political sentiment at home.      That's cool, I'm gonna wait till all the people with poor impulse control beta-test it first though.   iCrash  /sent via iMaps   What the hell has Meath done wrong?      MotionPie, there is almost no other better choice:  https://github.com/ccrisan/motionPie/wiki/Screenshots     Yeah, QTEs are never going to be my definition of finesse.   What happened to the 2nd last encounter being the hardest, the last a little easier to let the player end with finesse?   Yeah. If he was proselytizing regularly I'd have no time for him or his music, but I'm not going to fault him for an aspect of parents' choices.  He did tell us that "the information is ravenous. The ticker tape feeds the mind".  I can't help feeling that he knew more about living under a surveillance microscope than we did when that album was released, and he'd given us plenty of warning. Not that we really listened.   "I'd like two half-price Garda, and one Marijuana please"   In fairness to Beck, he was born into it.  Tom Cruise, well, he has no excuse.   I reckon saving citizens from unnecessary anguish and pain doesn't need a mandate. I hope so anyway.      http://www.vipleague.me/rugby/281503/1/italy-vs-ireland-live-stream-online.html    I think it's 12.   They're great.  They have me glued to the screen.   I'll look only at candidates that are not FF, FG   L.  I'll see what they're like closer to the time, as well as keep an eye out for the chancers running as 'Independent FF, FG or L' - that one really winds me up.  Which reminds me, I'm going to see if I can get people interested in banning those stupid posters from the town at the weekend. I think it should be one board in the town and one poster per candidate on that. It's 2015, they can use the web and / or canvassing.     Good for them.  I don't think that was the case during this debate though:  ["The report stage began at 11.50am on 10 July, and was adjourned at 5am the following morning. At about 2.40am, as deputies were awaiting a division, Tom Barry pulled ine Collins, a fellow Fine Gael TD for Cork East, onto his lap."](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protection_of_Life_During_Pregnancy_Act_2013#D.C3.A1il_stages).  So either the vast majority of the drinks that night were ordered between 5am   5.30am, or those 331 drinks were spread through the Dil's working hours.  I've little to no time for people who drink on the job.   You don't think they waited till the debate was over before they started drinking do you?         Great idea!  The 'Lapgate' [tally](http://www.irishexaminer.com/ireland/lapgate-fails-to-call-time-on-dail-bar-drinks-254568.html):  The Members Bar can stay open for up to an hour after the Dil has finished its proceedings, and on the night of Lapgate **served until 5.30am** as the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Bill was discussed and voted upon by TDs.  Takings in the Members Bar  exclusively reserved for TDs and senators  for that all night session amounted to 1,440.80.  Till receipts showed that 331 alcoholic drinks were downed by Oireachtas members during the session.  These included 105 pints of lager at a cost of 493.50, 74 pints of Guinness, totalling 318.20, 22 pints of Smithwicks costing 94.60, and 31 quarter bottles of wine amounting to 170.50.  Thirsty TDs and senators also knocked-back 31 bottles of beer at a cost of 145.70, and forked out 118.90 for 29 glasses of gin and vodka, and 85 for 17 brandies.  The adjacent Visitors Bar, where TDs and senators often entertain guests, and other Oireachtas staff and accredited media drink, also had a roaring trade that night, taking in 3,572.     The Catholic Church has plenty of money. If they didn't you'd think that over the last 13 years they would have asked the Vatican for a loan. It's not remotely broke. The Vatican Bank had ["a net profit of 87 million in 2012"](http://www.theexpgroup.com/blog/success-blog/vatican-bank-publishes-first-set-accounts/) on assets of 5 billions.  I think they're just running out of road, the part-true / part stalling-tactic of claiming complicated ownership structures has bit them on the ass. Now they'll have to sell more of what they can sell and they'll still be short.  Anyway, the church is extremely fortunate to have been giving such an easy time of it. It's not like they deserve it.      Yeap, and LG Smart TVs have already been caught doing it:  http://bgr.com/2013/11/20/lg-smart-tv-spying/       Sometimes I wish the parliamentary whip was an actual whip.   And before this they blamed 'complicated legal ownership structures', it's been 13 years since they were told they had to contribute.  They should have started selling back in 2002 when they were told to and then they wouldn't have this problem. They even got a deal reducing the amount the total amount they had to pay.  It's time to put a definitive deadline on repayment.   "I would wish the pharmaceutical company would be more reasonable dealing with such a small group of people"  He talks like he's in some Jeeves   Wooster show and I imagine he thinks that will impress people. He just sounds aloof and clueless.  As for the 'if MM gives me the number' - is that petty Dil point scoring over very real life-threatening diseases?  Imagine what the people with this illness must think hearing his tortured excuses. Amazing the amount of things this government has the money for with rushed or no debate, but saving Irish citizens' lives gets this heartless, drawn-out waffle.  It's time Marie-Antoinette of Mayo called a general election.       Imagine if he wins!? Would it then be ok for Government Ministers to talk about people's private lives or Garda interactions on TV any time they want?  I can't believe he's dragging this out. He must feel the risk to his reputation is worth the chance of the appeal failing.  Then there's the commission of inquiry ...    Article 12 of the European Convention on Human Rights   states:  Men and women of marriageable age have the right to marry and to found a family, according to the national laws governing the exercise of this right.  That is not an attempt to define Marriage. It is stating the right of Men   Women to marry.  Nowhere does it state a limitation on what gay marriage can be, should be or is.  All you've done here is state that the ECHR has nothing to say about gay marriage.  Please remember nuance while you are advocating a two-tier citizenship for Irish citizens in Ireland based on sexuality.    The Wolfson DAC clicks onto the Pi, no soldering required, then I put [Rune Audio](http://www.runeaudio.com/) on it.  From there it can be controlled via any browser, or ssh in.  I've put it in an old stereo cabinet so it's all hidden away, and the sound is beautiful.   The irony of Ghostery finding **20 trackers** on that article ...   They are fantastic though.  I've the Wolfson DAC and the improvement in sound is astonishing.  Crystal clear sound for ~80 isn't bad. I wouldn't be without it now.    So what are you proposing?   Well, we don't have to wonder. We can just look at the UK which has a few decades of privatisation, and let that guide us:  ["The universal experience of water privatisation in the UK was a sharp increase in the cost of water. On average, prices rose by over 50% in the first 4 years. The first 9 years produced an increase of 46% in real terms, adjusted for inflation. The details are shown in the table below."](http://www.psiru.org/reports/uk-water-privatisation-%E2%80%93-briefing)  Plenty of data   review on that site, worth a look.  The TL;DR is that privatisation has not improved efficiency, has not brought prices down (the reverse happened) and that infrastructure improvements never materialised or were quite delayed and of poor quality.   Nah, but I'm guessing if there's anything that will prompt one - it will be about this stuff: Callinan's resignation, Garda et al.  Though IW will certainly be in the running.   I use an Odroid U3 as a desktop and it's great! Works for days   days, isn't crazy slow or super fast. More than capable as a desktop replacement. I've been using one for ~6 months. I use another as XBMC + TV Computer.  The C1, on the other hand, I can't imagine is quite the same. It's considered ~30% less powerful. I haven't got one yet though, so I can't tell you for sure.  Though for casual surfing (no flash video) and simple office tasks I'd say it would be very good value, just not super fast.   Using an eMMC rather than an SD card is essential for good speeds on either.  This would bump the price up a bit, ~30 for an 8gb eMMC.  I'd place the C1 as a good way to turn a 'dumb' TV into a Smart TV, but not for everyday office use. The U3 is fantastic as both, I can tell you that from experience.   Edit: Oh well, you can scrap the below. The video eventually started stuttering and was agony after I skipped forward 30 seconds.  ~~Oddly enough, I tried this about 20 minutes ago.  A 10-bit video on a regular Pi B with this OpenElec build and it played!  There were block artifacts at the beginning but after about 5 seconds they stabilised.  I'm still surprised, and I'll probably watch the whole thing tonight, saves me a commandline snafu with ffmpeg.~~      They have to read something while they're sitting in the station ;)   Enda Kenny has denied that his Fine Gael colleague had any role in shutting down a Dil debate on alleged Garda malpractice last week  This reminds me of the McNulty appointment fiasco, where 'nothing untoward' happened - only to be followed a week or so later with 'the appointment fell below our usual standards' and 'unnamed FG officials' causing the problems.  Whatever about Shatter's involvement, I wonder if Enda is on record denying that **he** had any role in shutting down the debate?  edit:  The letters are [here (pdf)](http://www.merrionstreet.ie/en/ImageLibrary/20150103OHigginsInquiryDocuments.pdf), and the journal has a summary [here](http://www.thejournal.ie/enda-kenny-alan-shatter-letters-1918378-Feb2015/)  There's plenty to read, though during a quick look I saw this from an Alan Shatter letter pg 25 of 33 - "it is my view that the rule of law and the constitutional principle of the separation of powers should be upheld and respected".  I still think that via Brian Purcell either Alan Shatter or Enda (perhaps both) got Callinan to resign. We should ask all involved.         I find the tone of some [Garda Review Magazine Covers](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/BjsnlCsIQAEUyz9.jpg) unacceptable.   I feel both can happen at the same time.  /onelittlefavouruniverse   In fairness to my pal, she was correct.  The exchange is one of the earliest ones enabled, the lines clearly running across the road to the exchange and were dug up enough times too. It's Eircom's responsibility to ensure the d2ds know the locale.  On a personal level, I'm with Digiweb and my neighbour's with Eircom. The only difference in our lines is where they split at the two houses. I get my fibre upgrade in 6 days all done, and no drops. My neighbour waits 6 weeks, and it takes 3 months to get a stable connection.  I reckon Eircom's problems are fairly ingrained at this stage. Though in fairness, I think they're also in a bad position - responsible for almost the entire infrastructure and trying to be a regular telecom company at the same time, with plenty of ethos / staff left over from its public utility days.   Cheers for that, I was guessing Dil privilege was one thing the government did not want to see used during the debates.  So I can see the CC's point with privilege, though I would have loved to see such a debate, and what the opposition came out with.   Might have been staggered crops.   I think it's a fair point from Padraig that 'sub judice' is typically for juries and high court judges are expected to know how to avoid such a bias.   I don't have one, so I wouldn't have a clue sorry.   It is shocking really, for such an agriculturally accomplished nation, we should be ashamed at the quality sometimes.      A friend of mine was told, by a door-to-door Eircom fella, they couldn't get reliable Broadband as the exchange was too far away.  The exchange is the big building right across the road (~20m at most).  He was given an earful for that mistake.   didnt handle it well  :);):)   Maybe it's because I'm not signed-in, when I click events it's all the previous ones.  Anyway, I know when   where for tomorrow!   Unbankable 5   The facebook page is fairly out of date      There's a big thread about game emulation with the Odroid [here](http://forum.odroid.com/viewtopic.php?f=11 t=2684 sid=8d49f9d35f95aa682984545afea372fe start=450). I love my odroids, I've only played a few emulated games - I'd no problems though. They're quite fast compared to the Pi.   'The lady protests too much'   Yeah. I think it's a de-privacy plague.  I've had no luck convincing people to use one browser for Facebook only, and another for everything else.   Aye, I'm more worried about the digital bread-crumbs people are unknowingly leaving around from even a 5 minute surf on the web. If I can get my f   f doing something about that, then I'll move them onto more robust protections for their devices overall.  Though I'll end up automating most of that, if previous experience is anything to go by. Not that I blame people, if a car mechanic starts explaining the intricacies of engine repair my eyes start to glaze over after a few minutes. So I reckon most people feel that way about computer security   privacy.  	121

 This is exactly it. Thank you, from every creepy part of my being.    This came out BEFORE Warehouse 13. It was a website that people could submit content to. The format was that you were reading files on a secret asylum for dangerous supernatural objects and/or creatures. Each story was given a case number and some of them were terrifying. I seem to remember one of them was about a man sized doll like thing that always stood in the corner, but if the lights went off, or someone stopped watching the camera feed, it would move to a new location. (Pretty sure this is Pre-Weeping Angels) Any ideas? I've looked and looked and haven't come back across it. Thanks in advance for any help.   As much as I want to agree, we fired him and Cincinnati gave him a place to land. Instead, we should be proud that the Ohio NFL is completely in honor of Paul Brown. Cincinnati is the only team in the AFCN that I have respect for, and the way they treated Paul Brown is the main reason.   Yup      Never had an issue with a 20 dollar knock off from AliExpress. Never bought a piece of official NFL gear that wasn't junk.   Brandon Weedon.    Good looking out! Thanks   I don't think I'm going to be able to make it. I live in Index, WA. It will be years before this happens again, and it rose out of my price range between last time I looked and now. Thanks anyway, y'all.    Thank you very much, sir.   Hey, folks! Curious as to what sections a Browns fan would be looking to buy his tickets in? Which sections line the visiting side of the field? Thanks in advance!   Everything I hear is that they hate us, and when they meet us they take the time to ask us why America is so fucked up. But many people online that I have met from overseas have been very nice.    Seems legit!   What do you think the payoff will be like when we actually do win a ring?    "As if we need any more reasons for the [REAL God](http://orig00.deviantart.net/9bdf/f/2007/284/6/6/quetzalcoatl_by_genzoman.jpg) to hate this team"   It's like cutting down the Nazi forest. It stands as a reminder on how NOT to act. They are dooming us to repeat or mistakes   Go Flashes. Except James Harrison.    Probably as proud a moment for Haden as being drafted. He is a shoe whore of the highest caliber. Congrats, Joe!   If there is one thing a Browns fan is going to win at, it's corn hole   If they were ugly, Haden wouldn't have the #1 jersey. It'd be all: "I love Haden, but I wouldn't wear that jersey"   [Nobody is as happy as Brian on the right, there](http://imgur.com/kyf8iuY)   Yeah. These have no red on the throat, or green anywhere though. Orange head, white neck band, orange body, white tail band.   Heron. Debate ended.

If you don't mind me asking: What happened with the missing equipment? Also, thanks for letting us know you went on this trip!    Yeah.    Wait until the membership drive.       I had a friend who was signing some paperwork with a lawyer. The lawyer was dressed casual and felt the need to explain:  **Lawyer: I'm sorry about the jeans and tshirt. I'm on my way to a U2 concert as soon as we are done.**  Without missing a beat my friend responded:  **My Friend: Does that mean you are 'Pro Bono?'**  *Mic Drop*   That's oddly accurate. Good call.   Totally a gift from the grandparents in Kent. Has been in their closet for 20 years, I would imagine. You should scoop that other jacket, though!   It started originally in fiction as the symbol that the High Priestesses led by Vivian, The Lady of the Lake, wore in The Mists of Avalon. It has become, through pop culture, a symbol of women who are leaders within Wicca. It shows a person who is empowered. Not everyone uses it, but it was a powerful day when the women in our group decided to get their tattoos. Since getting hers, my woman is now the leader of the largest Wiccan church in the world: The Aquarian Tabernacle Church.   It is. It's religious.    Dear you, yes she does.       We call that "Nope". Don't smoke the Nope. You have vaped all the good you're going to get. It's a trick. Like chewing devils grass on the hard pan  I say thankee-sai.    I am mother fucking Steven Universe. I am doing great. All I wanna be, is a guy who gets to see a giant woman.   Now, /u/timteblows316, try to remain calm.   Lol!   godamnit.....   Still friends 18 years later. Shit...18 years is a long as time.   Holy water chugging contest.   What version of the devil? Are we talking handsome fallen angel, or cloven hoofed and horned demon?   I was 14. My date and I were lying on the bed, feet to head, and talking. My back was to her and she was facing my backside. My butt was directly in line with her face, and I farted. I farted loud and long. I then buried my head into my pillow and offered to take her home. She laughed and I knew then that she was one of the coolest people I knew. Still can't believe I did it.      It's true. My church runs an international online ministry and school. But if you are looking to elevate to High Priest/ess, you have to find a teacher willing to train you, and you have to get your elevations in person. Thank you /u/wolfnotaku, for the connection!   Well, I was just told people seem to really like slowpoke tail . lol    Lawn Darts    Beat me to it. Must all be in the reflexes.

In our house Jesus Christ turned to Jeebus Chrysler  turned to Cheesy Linguini turned into Jesus Luigi.

Learned this from an Irish friend. I have had it semi confirmed by another friend who is English but has lived in Ireland for twenty years,  that it is a real Irish cryptid. I can't find any info on it online or in books,  though.   Damn...I thought y'all were gonna to, in addition to complaining, take some action to make things better.  Just grabbing the low hanging fruit without attempting to make a difference?  Well that's at least comfortably normal. At least #WeBarkTogether    *There will only be 19 people who will even get this, but the Tower compels me.*  "But time was funny now, and the Cleveland Browns new coach was as trig as someone dancing the commala at charyou.

Skeptics may disagree, but 4 out of 5 dentists know the truth.   Cactaur a hater   I follow all the current roster that has social media, that I can. Shiz is usually dope, yo. #SpencerFuckingLanning   I just want the people on my team to have some social media sense. They need it to be a good example for the man literally rehabilitating off of social media. I'm not all in on Johnny, my history will show me as a Hoyer fan, but I understand addiction, and social media is part of his addiction. I DO want him to succeed. This kind of stuff hinders that, imo.   Additionally, I would be willing to bet that if West, Crow, and Duke are in a three way tie, it will come down to personal conduct, and this kind of stuff shows a person as not being mature. Will that impact the front offices opinion on him? *Shrug* I just hope for a good, powerful, responsible, team. **We Bark Together**     Give a joker a selfie stick, they immediately start flicking off the camera.       Only one I saw missing was Phil 'The Other Toe' Dawson.   Georgia    You're welcome, and thank you for your insight!    No hunters here.    Shannahan doesn't love you. You are a stepping stone to him. The next step in  the fulfillment of his own designs. As soon as he sees a higher step, he'll take it and f @$ you over for being in the vacinity when he does. Because he'll throw your whole organization under the bus to make himself not look bad, and justified for not having the honor to stand by his contract. Though you'll most likely decide he was better off the team than on. Just the same as every other team he has been on.   Yes. It is a green, plastic, mailbox from a demolished house that was salvaged to replace our aging, wooden, one. And that is also a convex mirror worn we ooden rsys that come off of it.

She used to get really freaked out as a puppy,  but grew out of it.    There is no water to be reflecting.    Thank you, Professor.   Quetzalcoatl? I think he is more into soccer.   Sorry to be kinda agro in my other post. I'm not trying to be like that. We had no one else here. No kids, everyone would be at least 5'7".   The top part of each arm has tattoos, yes.   [Here is a picture from the 2 evenings after the initial photo when I was trying for a comparison](http://imgur.com/e1qyUHf) Also, the last part of your post rationalizing away everything with possible scenarios is...I don't even know what... The most made up part of this whole account is the stuff you threw in there. I told you no one was home except for me, my wife with long red hair, a tattooed man and his long haired, heavy set wife. We live in the middle of the country. We don't even have sidewalks. No kids were home. Also, the dog rolling in the yard wouldn't allow anyone to just randomly be there.   The only women who were here have long red and brown hair. Though none of them were on the porch. Everyone but me and the dog were on the other side of the house.   Opinion noted. Thank you.   Yes.   [How is this?](http://imgur.com/Fd5e1EE)   I didn't post it to explain it. I posted it to share. I also am not the belief police. I don't mind if you don't believe in ghosts. I'm sharing to add content to the community. He has no back, no lower body, and the way his arm would be up by his ear is unnatural. I thought it could stand the community going over it, not me trying to explain it's validity. I only know what I know.    A little background. We just returned home to our house in GA. It is also a small local church with a small congregation that has been meeting there while we have been gone. It has always been haunted. You can just feel it, hear it, doors won't open, lights will go funny, etc. We have been gone, and the people watching it had vacated and it was in a level of disrepair that had me really unhappy. Two people from the folks from the church were there. A tall skinny man and his wife, who is very heavy set with long hair.  I took this establishing shot because my wife and I were considering selling it. I then thought I had caught a weird energy ribbon  on the porch. I freaked out because I thought it was an apparition. Then I realized it looked just like the man who was over, and I decided to prank  my wife and show her the "ghost" I found in this picture. She freaked out just like I did. I then told her it was just our friend and she laughed and commented that it looked so creepy we should a how it to the guy himself and tell him it was a ghost, only to reveal it is actually himself. It would be hilarious! So we did it. Only he sobered us up in return. This was actually looking in the same 2 hours, mind you. He said: "My hat's red, man. And that arm of mine is covered in tattoos" He pointed to his Nascar hat (the hat in the picture looks brown), and pulled his sleeve up to reveal a wizard tattoo. Then my wife notices the second figure crouched down in front of the lowest red circle on the wall, seeming to be sitting. But there is nothing but a shelf there, and then we noticed where the man pointing toward the door is standing was nothing but building supplies and junk.   So, there it is. I don't know, but I know those weren't people that were here. My wife says that they look like Kenny Paradise (the tall skinny guy) and Doc Thompson (the sitting guy that looks like he is wearing glasses and blue scrubs) they both used to live here, and she says she has met them both before they died.   [Here we go. This album shows a series of closeups](http://imgur.com/a/OQbYk)      I bought this off a Jain (follower of Jainism) who explained to me that the color comes from the idols in India where they smear a paste of tumeric and the red color that they use to make the dot on their third eye, which makes this color. Awesome picture, btw!   And as Ganesh is the Remover of Obstacles, our run game is about to be off the chain. (Dawg Pun)      Yeah, I would have a show like Oprah.  I would be the host of, everyday Christmas Give Dusty a wish list.  I'd probably pull an Angelina and Brad Pitt.  And adopt a bunch of babies that ain't never had shit.   Give away a few Mercedes like, "Here, lady, have this".  And last but not least grant somebody their last wish.  It's been a couple months since I've single so.  You can call me Travie Claus, minus the "Ho Ho".   Get it, I'd probably visit where Katrina hit.  And damn sure do a lot more than FEMA did.  Yeah, can't forget about me, stupid.  Everywhere I go I'mma have my own theme music.   I'll be playing basketball with the President Dunking on his delegates.  Then I'll compliment him on his political etiquette.  Toss a couple milli in the air just for the heck of it.  But keep the fives, twenties, tens and bens completely separate.  And yeah I'll be in a whole new tax bracket We in recession but let me take a crack at it.  I'll probably take whatever is left and just split it up.  So everybody that I love can have a couple bucks.  And not a single tummy around me would know what hungry was.  Eating good, sleeping soundly.  I know we all have a similar dream.  Go in your pocket pull out your wallet and put it in the air and sing.      "The only coach in the NFL not connected to Paul Brown is Chip Kelly"  The funny thing about that in my opinion, is no coach reminds me of Paul Brown, with his ability to create new ways to play the game while skirting the rules, like Chip Kelly did with the remote controlled car during mini camp. Brown would have pulled that same card if they had portable video and remote controlled cars in 1950.   When anyone says "that is something I do do" I always say "You said 'do do'." I also giggle when someone says "duty."  I am 32.   I really like this subreddit.   It's close,  but the one I saw was so very red. Not spotted at all, and the yellow was not dirty or muted. It Was VIBRANT. I can only defer to the people I asked, and if you think it's a Summer Tanager, and they DO look very similar, I am going to assume I just saw the most vibrant avatar of the Summer Tanager in existence and be proud! Thanks, all!   It was about the size of a cardinal, but it had no crest. The pictures that have been suggested are not what I saw, but thank you for the interest. I have been busy and am just getting back. The top half of it was cardinal red. Like it was the neck of a [Makers Mark]( http://img3.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20111216193258/whiskey/images/a/a1/Makersmark.jpg) whiskey bottle. Then the lower half of it was yellow to orange, or orange to yello, but the difference between the red and the rest of the body was dramatic.   I was driving down to the boat launch, and near the bend in the road, this bird was standing in middle of the street. It had no black on its body. If a Phoenix was actually a canary, then this little candle flame of a bird was a Phoenix. It was so neat and as an avid bird watcher, I screamed when I saw it, because I had never seen anything like it. I couldn't get my phone out before it flew away. I have been on WhatABird and all over Google and I can't find it. Any ideas?        The Usual Suspects   Every day it's the same thing: Lotioning and Oiling and Oiling and Lotioning.

My grandparents are friends with the former equipment manager of the Browns when I was a baby. He moved when the team moved, and I think he is still with the Stealers. (I wrote that correctly) But I was decked out in merchandise from the employees catalog as a baby. I was an Orioles fan as a child because I was so used to the color orange (Ripkin helped)     That's a powerful story. Thank you.   Was there ever a time that you thought you could leave the Browns behind, and follow a new team? Was there ever an "Historic low point" that you went through as a Browns Fan?   Well, little person, we didn't just print money. The government taxed the American People for that money.    I m holding out for a #5 jersey   Is that shit legal?!   It's a QB situation.  He wont start getting quality receivers until he has a quality QB. You don't trick out a Chevette with pipes and rims.

 you can comment/vote on pictures, that's all.   haha      Byblos is not bad.   it's not worth your time.                           I wouldn't. As you settle more cities, the cost of techs go up, so I'd rather attack Iroquois and take their cities.         United   Here is something you can entertain yourself with.  http://thearima.com/questions/who-is-the-best-current-soccer-player-messi-or-ronaldo   Not sure why teams are getting new logos and the new ones look worse than the old ones.      definitely looks like a watermelon to me   Never seen my club live.  I must not be the only one.   Yeah, it looks stacked, but you know, we play a lot of games during the year, and I'd say you want at least 8 midfielders (2 people per position) for subs   injuries, so it's not that many.   Some trophies are worth more than others, and League Cup, that's really half of a trophy imo (league champion = 1 trophy, continental = 2 trophies).   Vidal is leaving to Bayern right (or at least that what others have been saying), so really there aren't that many midfielder on the team.   I think this is a really good offer, tbh. Their valuation is at 4MM, which means they've probably raised a seed round of ~1MM (my guess), and they are willing to offer 100k + bonus. This is a really good sign.  Equity wise, I think 1.7% for the 10th hire is also very very decent.   Vidal didn't play his best season, IMO, and I wonder if this is because of some personal reasons or he is starting to decline. He is 28 already so I guess 40M (or slightly more) wouldn't be too bad, although I definitely want him to stay.   If that's true, then basically that means we can exchange Vidal for Draxler and Sandro.   If Vidal is leaving, Bayern will pay at least 40M right? So basically we get Sandro + 20M for Vidal.   Khedira will get a spot, I don't think he needs to find for one.  It's going to be Pogba, Khedira, Marchisio and (if Vidal leaves) Sandro (if he comes) or Pereyra.    I have unlimited data so I am good :)   Hi Professor,  Do you think getting an academic job is harder and harder nowadays?   I know quite a few adults who don't know how to ride the bike and they are completely okay with their lives.   Looks like a list of current managers only. I'd argue Ferguson, Lippi (among others) should be high on that list.   yeah, since the beginning of this year, she's been saying rate hikes, and its still not happening.            Hope he plays a good season this year, he is a really good player.      Charrrr!   All 4th year stats courses will recognize ECO375 as an alternative for STA302, but Econ will not recognize 302, so you should take ECO375 if you want to take 4th year courses from both departments.   Frankly speaking, you can skip any of the two classes.  APM466 - Luis Seco's tests follow his notes online, while his lectures are basically like blah blah blah, so you certainly can skip one hour. He usually starts like around 9:20 anyway.  STA457 - I believe Keith is teaching this year. He has really good notes, so if you have a friend taking notes for you, then you are good to go.   I think having a PhD student writing a letter for you is okay. Technically, when they are hired to teach, they are considered sessional lecturers, so they should be comparable to most lecturers in some sense. Most likely, the schools you are applying to will not know names of lecturers anyway, so it doesn't really matter.    My guess would be somewhere between 3.5-3.7 would be a reasonable GPA. If you have 3.7+ with good marks in your core math/econ/stats courses, then you should be in good shape.   But one could argue one on a shitter team is likely to do well, e.g. Giovinco.   It's hard to compare players of different age groups. E.g. Buffon vs. Courtois vs Neuer, how do you compare these people for one position when there is like 10 years between each of them?   He played 52 games for Argentina, so basically he should be comparable to other Argentine players with similar national team caps.   Yeah, I would not use a club sub unless it's a question that really targets only fans from that club. Otherwise a lot of questions on /r/soccer basically should go to some club sub.   I added it in.   Anyone prefer human like me?                  Hope he lives up to the standard of Pirlo.   What is your definition for lesser known?                  Yeah, that was not my question. My question is (I guess I didn't say it clearly) is how does he compare to an average MLS player (e.g. not a DP). Is he substantially better, or just better by a bit?   pyro is not bad, agree that he is a cool guy.   Anyone like Medic here?      Does anyone know who good Giovinco is compared to other MLS players?   This may look fancy, but is not practical play really. So, I won't know if that's "great" and should be tried by other keepers.                  Very useful!   I know del Piero will return eventually, but is that gunna happen this season?  	76

 I finished reading Matterhorn last week. I tried to start Dune yesterday which I had been meaning to read for a long time, I had to put it down though. It's almost like I'm feeling too emotionally connected to Matterhorn to the point that I'm still dreaming about it, that I can't immerse myself in a different story yet. Has anyone ever experienced something like this? What book did it for you?   I used to pretend a little dude was running across the trees/houses/hills outside my car window when I was riding passenger   I think I was maybe 3 at the time. I remember my babysitter giving me a bath before jumping out of the tub, running down the hall to my parents' room, and pooping on the floor. Then laughing a lot.  Not sure if this actually happened...   thanks for the info!      that's awesome, I'm glad I could help. I only posted this with the hope I could help at least one other person. Keep it up!   best of luck, I hope it helps you as much as it helped me!   hmmm, I can't think of any exercise in particular that would bother me. As I said before, I lift 3x a week (MWF) and run between 3-5 miles 3x a week on the other days.  Make sure to hydrate when you exercise, especially as the weather gets warmer.  Wish I had more insight into your specific problem   environment and community are along the lines of where I'm trying to take this, thanks  	9
 I just watched an expert on C-Span who wrote a book on The Bill of Rights.  She went back to the discussions at the time and said it was ALL about well-regulated militias and not at all about personal rights.  The militias were run by states and were designed to keep the states free of the potential tyrannical control of a central government.  http://www.c-span.org/person/?carolberkin      Grand Canyon, Zion National Park, Meteor Crater, AZ http://meteorcrater.com/, Hoover Dam, Vegas, Herst Castle, Carmel.    Don't vote for Trump.   I was there. She was great as usual.   No, but I had a friend who was asked to drive while the cab driver was making out with her friend.  They were going to a restaurant in the Bay Area and were afraid they could nor get a cab back, so invited the driver to dine with them.  He hit it off with her friend and was asked to drive while they got in the back of the cab. If you knew my friend, you would be laughing on the floor to hear the story.

I just love that this is the party that says that want to reduce the deficit.  They never do; they just have different priorities.

This sounds like today's twisted arguments over Obama.                How many of those 16 million vote?  It didn't help in the last election.   It is easier to quit than you think.

I use this link frequently when there is discussions on over-population.  http://www.upworthy.com/a-smartypants-scientist-makes-an-easy-analogy-about-our-planet-and-now-im-scared   Or Plato for that matter.   I wish that Occupy would have been more like the Tea Party in that the Tea Party turned out the vote.  We would be in a different place today had Occupy been more political.   Facebook has a site Las Vegas, the Good ol' Days, where tons of pictures are posted.  The folks there are a little older than I am though (and I am not young!)    Las Vegas, NV, not CA.  In any case, it was more like the movie American Graffiti growing up there.      Home Depot has spray cans which make it fairly easy. Color can be a problem as whites don't always match.   I remember when Nevada voted in a bond issue for prisons and against one for schools. Now those prisons are closed and we have no choice on schools. We need them.   How did social security numbers even get in the emails?  I wouldn't put mine on a email.  I feel like I am missing something also.   But that's what they would like!   I was thinking we all live in our individual bubbles, and it really is difficult to change people's minds (although it can  happen).   I picked up a hitchhiker one night decades ago.  He had a big paper bag.  When I let him off, he reached in the bag and gave me a baggie of weed.   I took a continuing ed class a few years ago on retiring out of the country.  It's a little hazy, but I think the teacher said you can buy medical insurance cheaply in Mexico, but not after age 80.  Then they will not sell any insurance to you.   How did he win the last election?  Was it just low turnout?   Wow. I want to visit.      It think it is crazy to put conspiracy theories all in one group.  Some events are results of conspiracies, some not.     I think about this often.  I have thought of the groups as tribes, and if there is a connection to heritage and where we came from.  You find diffrent views within families however, so I'm not sure how it would hold up.    Democrat or Republican?  I think there is room at the local level, or more opportunities if you want to travel.  I would make myself known at offices of elected officials and the party you are associated with.  You could get hired as a representative or hear about a 501(C)(4) position associated with policy.  Find a new candidate, do some fundraising to pay for your salary, get your candidate elected, then start your own consulting firm.  You could start out as a political writer like Jon Ralston.  You can get government jobs.  If you are a Democrat, check out Organized Karma.   If it doesn't look like there is potential in the long-term, go to law school.  I had a poli sci degree and worked mostly in nonprofits, but there were other options had I pursued them.   I wasn't able to pull up the article, but I can say I would like to live on a luxury cruise ship for a few years.   In the past, employment was used to distribute wealth.   I think we need to view a new way to distribute wealth.   Check this out if you really want to be convinced: http://www.upworthy.com/a-smartypants-scientist-makes-an-easy-analogy-about-our-planet-and-now-im-scared      Republicans will treat ANY Democratic president as radical, too liberal, etc.  In many regards, Clinton was one of them - a southern white male, but you would have thought at the time that he was the devil.   Not a small luxury, but I'd take that round-the-world cruise for a year.   If you don't mind staying in customer service, try c3connect.com.  Also, if you don't mind paperwork, the welfare office has been hiring like crazy since Obamacare.  nv.gov - family services specialist 1.   It's a tough job, but stable and full time.   I agree.  It scares me.   Republicans now control 30 states.  They can change the rules in these states how delegates are allocated: http://thinkprogress.org/justice/2014/11/18/3593173/what-you-need-to-know-about-the-gops-newest-plan-to-rig-the-2016-presidential-election/ Remember, these guys stop at nothing and have deep pockets.   Am I the only one who thinks about overpopulation?            Congratulations!    It was slow and easy-going.  We entered the fast-lane starting the 70's.   Roger Springs is cool.  Just don't drink the water! http://hotspringsoak.com/rogers-hot-springs.html   What I want to see is a statute of Obama with his birth certificate in his hand and a big grin on his face.  Maybe giving the bird to the right wing  might be cool too.      I wish we could start a reddit coop and buy/install our own at a reduced rate.   No clue, huh?   I'm a liberal and I agree.  I'm not sure what we can do differently and I think about it often.  You don't want the unintended consequenses.   Also, the military was totally socialist.  Now it's probably half and half.  We have a lot of private contractors involved with the military.   I worked as a job counselor for 8 summers for a federally-subsidized Summer Youth Program where about 1,000 kids worked for nonprofits, schools, etc. for 8 weeks during the summer.  Some even worked as firefighters.  This program operated for years and Congress kept reducing it to almost nothing,  It gave young people the opportunity to see how the working world works, and many of those kids went on to become successful, productive citizens.  I think it was worth it.  They also had a short-term program for adults - and when the economy was down, more money was allocated.  You may not like it, but it keeps people in the job market, the money gets spent in the community and we all do better.  I hate this trajectory we are on.  All the money now goes to the rich in terms of tax cuts.  And contrary to what many believe, they are not necessarily the job-creators.  We subsidize the rich with their low-paying salaries through tax benefits, and in making up the difference in low-wages with welfare, food stamps and medical.   Keep saying that while all the tax breaks go to billionaires, and you end up working for peanuts.  We are all going to be poor at the hands of Republicans.  They don't support whites - they support billionaires!   Thank you for stating this.      Amazing how that is probably NG's most famous cover.   They wear me out watching them.  They have deep enough pockets.   It wouldn't be that high if businesses and lawmakers  hadn't work to bring down wages.   I don't know, but loosening regulations usually results in ripoffs.   Nursing school might be cheaper here.  You can become a nurse in 18 months at NV State College if you have the prereqs.  You can always take the skills back to Washington.  Cost of living is cheaper here also.  I would love to have my grandparents house on Queen Anne Hill overlooking Elliot Bay.  It was sold for $10,000 after they died, and would sell for $1.5 million today.            They will try to impeach him instead.   He was the minority leader before he was majority leader.  He was very skilled and will do it again.  He does support support black and hispanics that have solid membership in the party-but not 94%.  I don't know where you got that number.     Silver does it to my skin.            I think that is a great idea.   I learned this lesson when I was young.  We had a march in our town supporting welfare clients who had been cut off the rolls.  An anti-welfare group was started.  I ran in to the leader of the anti-welfare group at our legal aid office.  He had had a heart attack, his wife left him, he lost his house and was looking for free legal help.  It comes around.      The Republican Party is 90% white.  We should be calling it the White Person's Party.  Romney's vote was 96% white.   I post these numbers all the time on reddit because I was so shocked when I initially read them.  Young people are only less republican because they they are a more diverse group.  Young whites still voted for Romney.     But do you want to impose your values on everyone else?  I'm a progressive and I support your rights to have your values.  But don't impose them on me.   This woman seems crazy.  I just don't get it.   Are you kidding?  What war did he get us in to?  What economy did he crash?   Very cool.   They don't see it that way however.   That is what question 3 is all about.  I believe the tax is a percent OVER 1 million income, so if you made 1,000.001, you would be taxed 20 cents.  I don't think that is so bad.   Hotels have lobbyists which come out of the woodwork the minute a lottery is suggested.    I voted yes on all three.  The legislature is unable to pass a tax to help schools.  They had time through many sessions to come up with other options.  When they don't do anything,  we have to wait another two years until they meet again.  In the meantime, nothing is done.  We have to do what they are incapable of doing.   25% of the children in the schools live in poverty.  I do not have children, but believe that all children need a good education.  Teachers also have a great investment in their education and need to be paid a decent wage also.  I believe they cannot recruit enough teachers because the starting salary is so low.  This is crazy.  Mining has not been taxed since the State created its constitution. They had lobbyists even then and wrote it into the state constitution that they be exempt from taxes.  They have had their free ride and now need to contribute to the state's wellbeing also.    I voted for the Court of Appeals, but do not have a passion for the issue.  I just can imagine that the other courts are backed up too.    They have been great with my personal banking also.   A photo area where friends can get their photos taken.

I've always had the suspicion that this was the case.   The numbers are all over the board.   It's a more beautiful city than I thought it would be.  I went to a convention there earlier in the year.  The house are cute and the neighborhoods look better than mine if you don't mind seeing a few burned houses in every neighborhood.      Pretty much sums it up.   Good luck.  I live in the area and will keep my eyes open.  Do check at the pound.  (By the way, I was ticketed last week by Animal Control for letting my dog out in front of my house.  She never goes more than 1 house away, but someone complained. I guess she would lick them to death.)   I saw you!  Good luck too!   I'm older than anyone here.  I would move in a heartbeat if I didn't have a husband who doesn't want to leave my zipcode.       I remember when abortions were illegal everywhere.  If you could afford it, you could fly to Mexico for a legal abortion (or elsewhere).  If you couldn't, you opted for a local illegal one.  I knew women in both categories.  I knew a young woman who was blind-folded in a hotel room.  Another ended up in the hospital for a DNC.  One died.   Guys (and some females) like to view themselves as "tough".  It's absurd really.   I'm sorry to hear this.     I read his books in the 70's and I hear Hillary did her master's thesis on him (he was from Chicago and she was also from Illinois).  He was a successsful union organizer and his the threat of his tactics were enough to win issues.  His tactics were fun for members to participate in by members.  Example:  The mayor of Chicago loved the opera.  He threatened to have a picnic serving beans to union members and providing them free tickets to attend the opera.  Never had to pull off the picnic; the threat was enough to win his way.   This guy is crazy.  He was all over Clinton and his poor staff who couldn't afford the legal challenges and stress.   I was anxious to see how he would be under GW Bush.  Hardly heard a word.  Now he is apoletic about Obama.   Pioche is kind of fun.  Also a little lake there is you like fishing.  They have community fairs several times a year, and people come from all over to attend.      The supremes gave GW Bush the presidency.     You can ignore reality if you want.   I see volunteers hired all the time also.   I'd prefer to beat them however.     	144
 I know it wasn't a good adaptation of the book, but the movie itself  I thought was good. Like what was so bad about it?   I was actually so sad. Not because of him but because of his mother.

LOL try to find Amy Schumer's skit from her show. It's from season 3, and the episode is titled after the sketch I think it's called something like 'Sorry'.

 I have removed this post because while this is a lovely post, it doesn't quite fit with the theme of Thalassophobia.    And we're working hard to try and squash the reposts that don't meet the three month criteria. Each submission is now being reviewed by a mod and while it might take a bit of time, we do check every post to see if it is a repost. However, there are some that we miss. If you find a repost, please report it to us. It will add weight to our final decision.   I agree completely and that's what we're going for. I feel that the subtle outline of something seen from the corner of your eye adds so much to a photo of the ocean. And even some animals in general, but this sub is quickly becoming /r/sharkweek and /r/seacreatures. We're hoping to find a happy medium between the two.      I agree. For critters there is always /r deepseacreatures and /r/TheDepthsBelow.   Hello everyone! Recently we've seen an influx of animals being posted to /r/thalassophobia that aren't really thalassophobia inducing. Starting Monday, 27 July 2015, we will begin a week-long trial of removing most animal posts. We understand that some sea creatures are central to some people's thalassophobia and those that fit into that grouping will be allowed. However, photos and videos of just sea creatures with no explanation for the fear it can induce will be removed. During our trial run, all posts will be reviewed with more scrutiny. As usual, please note the rules in the sidebar with regards to reposts. If you're looking to see when the last time a picture was posted, I would recommend using [KarmaDecay](https://www.karmadecay.com) and even just reddit's simple search function can help. If you find something violating the rules please use the report button and let us know. We do review each report and take appropriate actions.  Thank you.  Edit: We now have a button in the sidebar to view posts that have been deemed Exemplary   While this is nice, I've removed it as it doesn't fit into the category of thalassophobia.   Hi there.

 And how's Louisiana's economy doing after all that giveaway? Still next to last?      This guy only saved himself and his family. Other Chinook pilots overloaded their helicopters with refugees, then went back again and again. One friend who was helping unload helicopters during the operation said that one pilot came with in with just his motorcycle in the helicopter. Everybody on the deck was pissed because he didn't help bring anybody else in.   If the intent was to scare people from joining the military then why did he go to the reserve center? It's not clear to me that that was the intent. Maybe he just chose the targets because it was low security, like a burglar who chooses targets that don't have security systems. Furthermore, he didn't target recruits, all of the casualties are current members. In Iraq, the terrorist intimidation against voters targeted the voters themselves. ISIS targets specific groups like police and military officers, among others, but all who fit a particular political agenda.   Those are elements of terrorism but not the only ones.  From Merriam-Webster (emphasis mine)  Full Definition of TERRORISM:  the *systematic* use of terror especially as a means of coercion  Or better yet, the Oxford English Dictionary:  a. gen. The unofficial or unauthorized use of violence and intimidation in the pursuit of political aims; (originally) such practices used by a government or ruling group (freq. through paramilitary or informal armed groups) in order to maintain its control over a population; (now usually) such practices used by a clandestine or expatriate organization as a means of furthering its aims.  b. In extended or weakened use: the instilling of fear or terror; intimidation, coercion, bullying.  Obviously, instilling fear or terror is broad; any shooting does that. I don't see that the motive was to intimidate, coerce or bully. It was an angry, unstable man.   That's a better way of stating the question that I was posing:  It comes down to intent. If the shooter was trying to intimidate or coerce, he didn't do a very good job. And he left nothing declaring political ideology or goals the way Roof's manifesto did.  I see this is a single angry, crazy guy who wanted to leave this Earth and take a few people with him. The reason for choosing his target may be political but it's not terrorism.   I listened to the Diane Rheem show today and one person said "Obviously, it's terrorism." No, not obvious to me. Not all politically motivated attacks are terrorism. Who is he trying to scare? The U.S. Marine Corps? If he wanted terrorism, there are much higher profile targets that would yield far better returns:  Boston bombing, DC snipers are just two examples.   Add projections if you have that data available.   It's pretty easy to rationalize legally. A hospital doesn't just send people down to Costco once a week to pick up supplies. They are all delivered by distributors. They also have a lot of fixed costs:  Insurance, HVAC, janitors, infrastructure, waste disposal, etc. Many of those businesses that cater to hospitals also tend to carry higher-than-normal fixed costs such as insurance that are passed on up the chain. It all adds up.  But more to your point:  Hospitals make money. Some of them make a lot of money, even the ones that are supposed to be "non-profit."      Schools rely on test scores because nobody has come up with a better way that isn't overly fraught with arbitrary and contentious judgment.   That's a really long name. Kind of hard to remember too, and doesn't fit on a menu board too well.   In case pay-walled:  **The Mythical Connection Between Immigrants and Crime**  *Newcomers to the U.S. are less likely than the native population to commit violent crimes or be incarcerated.*  By JASON L. RILEY July 14, 2015 7:33 p.m. ET  Is the conversation that Republicans want to have about immigration any more serious than the one Democrats want to have about race?  The Republican presidential field sports no shortage of individuals capable of speaking intelligently about Americas broken immigration system. Sens. Marco Rubio and Lindsey Graham have drafted legislation on the issue. Jeb Bush co-wrote an entire book on the subject. And Rick Perry ran a border state with the nations second-largest immigrant population for 14 years. So why is Donald Trump, whose comments about immigrants and crime are as ugly as they are uninformed, doing all the talking?  The candidates who expect to outlast Mr. Trump in the primaries are no doubt eyeing his supporters. But Republicans would do better to focus on swing voters, whom they might lose if Mr. Trumps position on immigration is perceived as the GOPs. Mr. Trump is bringing heat to a debate that needs more light, and other candidates have an opportunity to provide it.  They might start by pointing out that numerous studies going back more than a century have shown that immigrantsregardless of nationality or legal statusare less likely than the native population to commit violent crimes or to be incarcerated. A new report from the Immigration Policy Center notes that while the illegal immigrant population in the U.S. more than tripled between 1990 and 2013 to more than 11.2 million, FBI data indicate that the violent crime rate declined 48%which included falling rates of aggravated assault, robbery, rape, and murder. Likewise, the property crime rate fell 41%, including declining rates of motor vehicle theft, larceny/robbery, and burglary.  A separate IPC paper from 2007 explains that this is not a function of well-behaved high-skilled immigrants from India and China offsetting misdeeds of Latin American newcomers. The data show that for every ethnic group without exception, incarceration rates among young men are lowest for immigrants, according to the report. This holds true especially for the Mexicans, Salvadorans, and Guatemalans who make up the bulk of the undocumented population.  It also holds true in states with large populations of illegal residents. A 2008 report by the Public Policy Institute of California found that immigrants are underrepresented in the prison system. The incarceration rate for foreign-born adults is 297 per 100,000 in the population, compared [with] 813 per 100,000 for U.S.-born adults, the study concludes. The foreign-born, who make up roughly 35% of Californias adult population, constitute 17% of the state prison population.  High-profile incidents, like the recent arrest of a Mexican national in the horrific shooting death of a young woman in San Francisco, can give the impression that immigrants are more likely to commit violent crimes. But the alleged killer is no more representative of Mexican immigrants than Dylann Roof is representative of white people.  Every immigrant here illegally has already broken a law, though that doesnt mean they are predisposed to crime. In a 2005 paper, the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago reported that more recently arrived immigrants are even less crime-prone than their predecessors. In 1980 the incarceration rate of foreign nationals was about one percentage point below natives. A decade later that had fallen to a little more than a percentage point, and by 2000 it was almost three percentage points lower.  Mr. Trump wants to have an unserious debate about immigration, one that involves scaring voters and scapegoating newcomers for crime problems that are mostly homegrown. The liberal press corps will continue indulging him because hes entertaining, and they know his bluster helps Hillary Clinton. But it behooves other Republicans to raise the level of discourse. After six years of President Obama fluctuating between doing nothing on immigration and issuing legally suspect executive actions that are still tied up in the courts, voters will want to know where the GOP candidates stand.  How do you balance border security and labor-market demand? Should relatives of people already here continue to be given an immigration preference? Is it time to move toward a skills-based immigration system similar to Canadas? How should the federal government treat border states and cities that bear the upfront costs of illegal entries? Is walling off the southern border feasible? Would it make the U.S. safer? And what should be done about the estimated 12 million undocumented people already living here?  Votersincluding the more than 40% of swing Hispanic voters that George W. Bush won in 2004will be paying attention not only to what the candidates say about border issues but also how they say it. Tone matters, and Mr. Trump sounds like someone eager to spurn voters that the Republicans likely need next year. Most people agree that illegal immigration ought to be reduced. The question is not whether its a problem but how to solve it. Its time for some adults in the GOP presidential race to weigh in.  *Mr. Riley, a Manhattan Institute senior fellow and Journal contributor, is the author of Please Stop Helping Us: How Liberals Make It Harder for Blacks to Succeed (Encounter Books, 2014).*      If it tastes good, eat it. If it don't, try something else. To each their own.   I bet he has a badge and everything.   Then what do you call a hard shell?   A restaurant where I live melts cheese on their tortillas first on the grill before throwing the meat on. They do this on the flat top, then they plate it. I think it's an improvement over traditional mexican tacos, which are already good.   You don't know the story and neither do I. But having been in business for over 30 years, I can say that you don't just fire somebody because you want to make a change. You fire somebody because you want to make a change and *they don't want to.*   That's one of the big issues. Even if Tsipras can get reforms passed, there is no trust that he will keep them in place. I do not see a good ending with his coalition in power.   Thanks for reposting. I forget that about WSJ.   You Canadians just have it too easy. Still, can you imagine trying to back into a 45 degree parking spot? My first question is WHY?      The letter-writer conveniently forgot to mention that it's 45 degree parking.   This is not parallel parking. It's 45 degree parking, which is all over downtown Portsmouth.   When you go up against irrational people, it doesn't matter if you arm yourself with science and logic; the irrational always win. If you say "the sky is blue" and they say "no, it's not," you might as well stop. You are not going to win.  The vast majority of policy makers are irrational and scientifically illiterate. Stop now. You are not going to win.   Personally, I've given up trying. We are past the point of no return anyways. Hope you enjoyed life at the top.   I've stopped wearing watches except when going to functions. That said, my Patek Phillipe that I purchased twenty years ago when I got a "real paycheck" hasn't lost a dime of value. I'm not sure that the Apple Watch--even the gold one--will be able to say that.   TL,DW   My hair stylist is Russian. She's a MILF and she is hot. I mean insanely fucking hot. She is devoted to her man, who is Ukranian (she's from Moscow). Sure, it's a hair salon so she's dressed to kill, of course, but she has shown me her vacation photos on her phone and she always, always looks un-fucking-believably-amazing for her man--nails, hair, makeup, heels, the works. On fucking vacation. The women walking around in baggy shorts and tank tops? They're American. They can do that because too many men have low blue pill standards.   Open wheel racing is just terrifying.   I thought it was a 12-sided 2-dimensional shape (what others have pointed out is actually a dodecagon). So I thought I was correct and found I was wrong.   When she was 4 I had to type the search term for them and read the answers to them but my goal was to help her learn how to learn. I started with shapes, animals, simple objects (house, tree, flower, etc). I would find a drawing they could copy with crayon and paper. The "clipart" option of Google image search was perfect for this. And it was fun for me and especially my wife.   Hey thanks. I printed one and I'll try to make a save.   Update: Do you know how hard it is to cut one of those things out?   Ah, I understand. Spheres will have voids between them and a dodecahedron doesn't. Thanks for the explanation.   Not knowing anything about this, why is it harder to use a sphere?   I play a game with my six year old where I give her a topic to research on Google and she writes a basic report or draws it, depending on the subject. We were driving somewhere yesterday and talking about shapes, the difference between a pyramid and a cone, trapezoids, rhombus, pentagons, octagons. She knows all of those, no problem. So I try to make it harder and the only thing I can think of is a dodecahedron.  "Do you know what a dodecahedron is?" I asked her.  "No. What's a dodeca... wait what did you say?" she replied. "Do-dec-a-he-dron." I repeated this a few times until she got it. "When we get home I would like you to draw it for me."   We get home, I give her my iPad, write the word down on a piece of paper for her to type into Google, and go into my office to do some work. She gets out her crayons and paper. About 10 minutes later I hear her crying. I walk into her room, there's a couple of crumpled pieces of paper on the floor and she's bawling. "IT'S THE HARDEST THING I'VE EVER DRAWN!!!!"  I thought it was a simple two-dimensional shape, like an octagon with more sides. I look on the iPad screen and see a twelve-sided, THREE DIMENSIONAL object. Aw fuck, I'm an idiot.  TL;DR: Tried to make my six year old draw a dodecahedron. Didn't know it was three dimensional. Made my kid cry and feel like a loser. Now both of us feel like losers.         The Presidential election is for the state delegates to the Electoral College. It's a state-run election, as are all elections involving at-large voters.   I find it amazing that 25% of Americans don't believe that humans and dinosaurs walked the Earth together.   It was tongue in cheek, glad you understood that!   The feeling of cool or cold can be created with simple thermodynamic principles:  Wet your skin with a spray bottle or towel and use a fan to increase evaporation. The evaporating water will draw heat from your skin.   Sometimes understanding takes even longer.   To observe that there is wealth disparity does not mean that it elicits feelings of envy or resentment. It appears that you can't accept that there are people who are very happy with their life as it is, who are perfectly content with simple comforts in a modest home and the ability to care for their family, who don't feel any urge to accumulate numbers in a bank account, square footage, or numbers of homes. I truly feel sorry for you and your seeming entrapment. I hope you find peace in your life one day.   I don't have any pitchforks, not at the ready or otherwise. It was an example of wealth disparity, the ability to purchase fair market value for a top-1% home and throw away the home. I find it interesting that you seem to think my post carried any animosity. It says a lot about your psyche. Why do you think I feel any jealousy? Are you projecting?   Sometimes the originals fade pretty badly due to bad thermal paper. Maybe a particular place won't accept it but it's worth a shot and it's better than not having a receipt at all.      I also find that when I do this I am a lot less likely to have a pre-bedtime snack.   I've done that when I've been lazy and I miss about 1/4 of the time. Plus I'd want to be more precise if I'm hanging something like a 70" TV or grandma's Renoir mounted in a 18th century gold leaf frame.   OK, no more party balloons for my kid.   What's the current best guess on when we run out of exploitable helium reserves?   I have an IT business. Let's say I offer new clients 3 months of free IT but I ask my technicians to work for nothing during that time. Kind of the same?   Percentage-wise, how much of the loss of helium is attributable to  human activity?   I only brought up an example of wealth disparity. You should seek those answers and solutions from others who are way smarter than me. Even Milton Friedman acknowledged the dangers of income disparity and he discussed possible solutions in his book *Capitalism and Freedom*.   Nope, not envious at all. I consider myself fortunate. I have a successful small business that yields a comfortable upper middle class lifestyle, a fantastic wife and kid and that I can afford to send to a great private school. I'm probably around the top 5% of annual income. But I think about income disparity because my company does a lot of business with the one-percenters, people who collect multi-million dollar homes.   It's a remark about income disparity, which is one of the topics of the article above. Construction workers, electricians, plumbers get thrown a few bones but macro economic studies have shown that middle class wages are stagnant even though productivity has increased. The beneficiaries have been those at the top.      Here's an example of what Sanders is talking about:  I'm an IT consultant and I was talking to a client yesterday. She and her family are wealthy, top 1% certainly, and are building a new home in a gated golf community nearby but it's not complete yet. They recently sold their existing home so had to move into a rental. It sold for $2.5 Million. It was a nice home on a nice sized wooded lot but nothing too out of the ordinary for the community (this is a VERY wealthy community).  I found out yesterday that the new owners completely razed the 3-level 10,000 square foot home and the adjacent four car garage with guest house above. They plan to build something new.  The buyers essentially paid $2.5 Million for a lot.   It wasn't the act of racism that got everybody talking, it was the Mass murder by gun. Did you somehow miss that?   Like the President remarked, it happens more in America than anywhere else so yes, I think there's room for improvement.    Everybody needs to watch [this video](https://youtu.be/IzjdQlw9N3U). Just watch it. (SFW)   Murica   You may know this only if you've had training to obtain a permit. Many states (such as Texas) now want to dispense with the training and permit requirement altogether and give everyone an automatic right to carry a concealed weapon with absolutely no requirement to be trained on its use and the responsibilities that come with carrying.   I'll just be clever, heheheeohshit   I'm a former AMA and AHRMA road racer. I learned the hard way in road racing that anger has no place in motorcycling or else you're going to be in for a short ride and a long day.   You missed the point. It doesn't matter what the initial act was. Two angry people. One on a motorcycle, one in a car. Neither backs down. Both escalate. WHO WILL LOSE? The answer is in the article.  Me:  I'm a rider. I have 2 Ducatis and 2 Nortons. Former AMA and AHRMA road racer. I learned the hard way in road racing that you have no business being angry on a motorcycle or else you're in for a short ride. All motorcyclists have had shitty things happen but you have to be defensive on the road. There is a comment from a fellow rider (it's the top one at the time I'm writing this response) that really sums it up well:  Be happy you're OK.   If you're angry, don't kick somebody's car because they might use that as a weapon and kill you, especially if you're on a motorcycle. Stupid navy assdick.   Crosswind landings are pretty normal. I'm a pilot and it's a normal part of training. Large commercial transports have a lot of momentum. Your job is to make the aircraft makes a straight approach even if your heading is skewed by the crosswind. Then at the last moment you use rudder and aileron to straighten out. You see in the video the pilot applying rudder. Flare and make sure the mains touch first and the aircraft's momentum will help ensure that you straighten out when both mains touch down. It may not feel great to the passengers but it's not really that dangerous.  I once flew (as a passenger) into Taipei while a major tropical storm was bearing down, with a quartering crosswind. Very turbulent but the landing was fine.         So what's her club? Name it without looking it up. Didn't think you could.   No kidding. Why would you expect him to know? Pretty damned arrogant of her. Who is she? What is her club?   Really? TIL....      CO*_2_* in the 500-1000 ppm range. Good luck.  Edit: Corrected ppb - ppm    most sites that use it have that bootstrap feeling to it  OP didn't give enough details to judge but depending on the content, it may or may not be what OP is going for. Conformity can be good in many cases (B2B sites, for example). It's definitely not in others (creative professionals or cutting-edge consumer products, for example).   Startup founder and tech recruiter here. There are two sides to this. A degree from a prestigious engineering program doesn't necessarily mean you know your shit any more than a HS grad but it does signal to a recruiter that you know how to work your ass off. You could get lucky with a HS grad and get one who knows their shit *and* works their ass off. You just have to dig deep into their background, maybe put them on a longer probationary period, etc.   There was a study recently that indicated Asians are basically penalized ~~150~~ 50 points on their SATs. I'll see if I can dig it up....  Edit: Corrected thanks to the link provided by @handydandydoo.   I've stayed at the Munich Novotel. Great place.         More conservative and louder. Throw in pundit media driven echo chambers and it just goes exponential.   Bush went to war even after weapons inspectors found absolutely nothing in 2003. Here's an article:  *"The weapons inspection teams in Iraq have visited breweries and former nuclear plants, and raided missile factories and pharmaceutical production lines. They have examined former weapons factories and interviewed scientists and university technicians. As of yesterday they had checked 230 sites in all. If one is to believe the few inspectors who have been prepared to be interviewed anonymously, they have found absolutely nothing.*  *Nuclear weapons sites that the British and the Americans claimed as late as last September had been reactivated have been revealed as rusting, disabled shambles. It may be that Iraq has squirrelled away its most portable weapons and components. But as one inspector complained to the LA Times last week, they had found 'zilch'.*  *He is not alone in his assessment. Another inspector in Baghdad complained to Newsday : 'If our goal is to catch them with their pants down, we are definitely losing. We haven't found an iota of concealed material yet.'*  [UN Inspectors Fear Bush Will Ignore Them](https://www.globalpolicy.org/component/content/article/168-general/37568.html), Global Policy Forum, January 5, 2003  (The Iraq invasion was launched on March 19, 2003.)   The best way to show compassion to war vets is to create more of them?   The industry term is *supply chain* and yes, China is where the supply chain is at so it makes a lot of sense for companies to do final assembly in China as well. A few companies have tinkered with doing final assembly in the U.S. for political reasons but it's very challenging to do so. If you make a engineering or design change, China can move that change into production in a week or less. If assembly is in the U.S. your parts have to ship overseas and may sit in customs for a while. It can take a month or more. In China if you get a bad batch of a certain part you can often have another source supply it almost immediately. In the U.S., again it has to get shipped across the ocean.  If you want to rebuild manufacturing in America you have to rebuild it from the very lowest parts--the raw plastic pellets, the nuts and bolts. I don't see that happening unless the Republican party agrees to higher tariffs.   This is no different than walking through The Venetian Casino.   If you were a Marine from anywhere else but Texas you'd know better than to allude to being insubordinate.   Oh, like cable.  	89

       I understood that user has to agree for every future microsoft ideas how to rule his or her computer to provide max profits for microsoft   My favorite VR headset is castAR - fianali coming to masses on early 2016 - look on kickstarter: https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/technicalillusions/castar-the-most-versatile-ar-and-vr-system      http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanpsy/article/PIIS2215-0366%2815%2900152-2/fulltext      I just  did mini tut form lifehacker  http://lifehacker.com/disable-ads-on-youtube-by-enabling-a-youtube-experiment-1171802208 but still I got 5s ad on the beginning each video. I used to have AdBolck but from the moment google started paying ransom to app owner worked much worst. Now new version of firefox filtering quite a lot of this stuff.   I hope I wrote clearly my point - however: English isn't my first language. If is something unclear, misspelled or grammar mistakes - let me know, I will edit this post. Thx a lot.  Couple  weeks ago google made announcement in media that youtube got almost any profits. Next day I noticed that on each youtube video instead of usual links to Adwords on bottom of video or clip with option out after 5s, it starts with 5s video clip.  After couple weeks almost each video started with 20s without option to leave ad. Yesterday I noticed most videos starts with 30s ad clip. Is google testing users patience? I wonder if this is usual treatment or just "personalized search results" made for my user profile.        That's my favorite stuff I waiting for.                                 And this is very , very bad move of Microsoft.

 Sorry about my ignorance but it is not as common as yugioh's show    It has an anime series, while Magic doesn't.   It is more common among my community than Magic.  Also, I rather not play so many card games, since I need to make room for other type of activites.    because it included many amendments. Of course, Congress does this a lot to many bills.   http://www.politico.com/story/2015/07/what-do-highways-have-to-do-with-planned-parenthood-and-obamacare-120440.html   Keep in mind, they pretty much only passed a short-term solution, so it is not tech FAILED.      Subsidized is another form of protectionism, right? Instead of taxing inhibiting trade, you just give money to businesses to cover costs.   I am in the same position lol   Run galaxy cyclone    Academica is coming after you and turn into cards!    No field barrier?   Igknights maybe because they will be the new hot deck after Clash of Rebellions is released.   Trade deficits take away from GDP because of exports - imports in the GDP equation. Are you suggesting that Greece should also maintain a trade deficit while in their budget ands fiscal deficits? Germany after ww1 had to run trade surpluses to repay its debts to foreign countries.   Republicans and conservatives used to be pro tariffs to protect U.S. manufacturing. Democrats used to be the anti tariff to export farm goods.   Economics is not a proven science. There are many schools of thought and they debate like politicians.   Microeconomics =/= Macroeconomics.   Economic Theory sometimes doesn't predict human behavior because we are not rational. = Behavioral Economics.   Of course... Trade Deficits don't matter, right? We should continue to run trade deficits by not doing anything to reduce imports and increase exports. Most of our free-trade agreements have increased our trade deficits with other countries. Will TPP reduce this deficit? How can TPP be the most progressive trade bill according to Obama, yet conservative enough for Republicans? Supposedly, all the rules and standards will be enforceable, so companies don't outsource as often and countries with those outsourced jobs have to improve conditions. If everything is level again, where is the "comparative advantage"?   any thoughts on the budget?         haha It has. Those pesky government public sector unions are the problem for the commuter rail lol      Yang Zing rise in power :)      you do realize that it is early in the race right?   Hillary Clinton should be concerned about Chafee because if her voters split between him and Clinton, then Sanders might be the top candidate.    Lincoln is a good replacement for Hillary's spectrum of voters, who don't want to support her, but indirectly helps Sanders to rise in the polls because the moderate wing is split.   Jim Webb is for those truely Conservative Democrats, which cmon... is like a nearly extinct species in the Democratic Party. DINOs! LOL  Sanders just needs to worry about O'Malley splitting his votes or hope Chafee vs Clinton gets intense for him to continue to rise.   They will probably delay the ban list until September and say that we had to follow OCG rules. lol   This was July 2nd 2ND! @ND @#132. We need a more recent update on the ban list.       Not a good response from a person who works for Konami. At least Konami as a company can try to make an article or an actual update on the ban list?    Wait until clash or rebellions because the upcoming maybe ban list might hit the current meta decks so previous sets might not be worth a lot unless you want those archetypes for cheap.    Ethan Finlay got subbed big time   Because Democrats are crowded in urban areas which is easy to pack. However in my blue state, we have a democratic supermajority yet the districts seem fairly sectioned off by region, but each region has a small major city, so it kind of keeps the democratic majority.   Independent Greeks, who are a populist right wing party in coalition, might not agree with this deal because they are euro skeptic. They might have supported the coalition to hope that it fails so that they might leave the euro.   if you looked closely at the no vote, many of them wanted to reject the past deal, but wanted to stay within the European Union.       Good for European Producers, who want cheaper costs in other countries.    Wouldn't Greece benefit from leaving the Euro and switching to a new currency? Now, Greece is able to control its monetary policy and well look attractable for outsourcers from other countries because their currency would be very weak, if they keep political stability. Also, Russia/BRICs could lend some help because Russia wants a good place to export goods and Greece has a trade deficit problem.   Yep. :\   Transferred out gio and then he scores a hat trick :/   True but there is no benefit since both players are on 0 points.    Just an interesting statistic that I would like to point out.    Peay gets 3 points, but low in piority. Villafina doesn't start, but my highest piority is Woodberry with 0 points. LOL  Maybe a rule change where if your bench player gets 0 points and one of your starting players doesn't start, then it will not sub in the 0 point player, but rather the highest scoring player next in piority.    New England United because we unite all of New England.   Nevermind, Liverpool Owners hate Manchester United   Well. They think it is practical, after all, most Americans rely on cars and airports, but the problem is that there is congestion in urban highways during rush hour and congestion in the air terminals. Also, you can only build so many lanes and runways before you don't have room.    It requires zoning rules to favor new development. Houston would need to have a more density oriented economy, after they build the subways for the subways to work and the economy to function.    After you build the subways, build high density apartments to increase supply of houses to combat high housing prices. :)   Progressive Conservatism?  Compassionate Conservatism?  Centre-Right?  Right-Wing Socialists?  Moderate Conservatives?  Liberal Conservatives?    If you could wait a month in advance, then Synchron Extreme structure deck might gain some traction in the meta. We don't know the ban list either, so we don't know what archetypes will get hit or gain power.    No. They are treated as monster cards, since they become spells when placed in their zones, but more specifically they are just pendulum cards.       They dislike rail because they would rather have us build more highways and airports.   We need a candidate for president, who will put forth a plan to build highspeedrail across the USA.   Goldwater basically said that extremism is good for liberty and moderation is no virtue.   If the sounders have so many seats available, then I am pretty sure that most of the demand has been satisfied for soccer at any price. Also, the sounders have been in this league for a while, so any potential casual fans have been reached.   You would think that there would a huge demand for young workers, since people retire so earlier but youth unemployment rate is also high.   Even if Lampard doesn't start, Villa could get Lampard's service in the future. So it is expected that villa will do well in he future, if Lampard does well.   Aliens   Ouch to all the players who transferred him in lol   Kick the can down the road again :|      Republicans are only supporting Sanders because he is more liberal than Clinton.    Them effect veiled gets limited in this ban list or the next lol   Anime nostalgia, locals marketing by konami, support for older archetypes, the old viewers of the duel monsters are older with more disposable income, etc    Crew concedes a lot of goals, so... :)         Dimensions know other methods, but it is less common.    Yugo gets jealous at Yuya. - basically     I feel as though Yugo's response would be anger at Yuya for getting an advantage as "King" of the synchro dimension, even though he isn't from there. lol   The head of security wants Yugo jealous of Yuya, so there would be a battle between Synchros and Standard. Then, Fusion invades while this happens.   The positioning of the cards on the card zones. Where you place the card actually matters!   The tariff issue is one area, where you can show the change in the dominant faction of each party throughout our history. I said Democrats tend to be for tariffs because a small faction wants it, but the majority doesn't really, but support other protectionist methods.    Republicans used to be pro-tariffs to promote domestic US Manufacturing. Democrats were against tariffs, so they could export farm goods.  Now...  Republicans are against tariffs because it is bad for businesses in a global market place. Democrats tend to be for tariffs to promote US manufacturing.    The best candidate will be neither Clinton nor Sanders. Sanders might be too liberal for the general election. Republicans have already launched attack ads on Clinton, even though she isn't the actual official nominee.   The "rising living standards" as a result of NAFTA was supposed to reduce illegal immigration from Mexico too ;)   Also, don't forget to include the costs of repairing and reinvesting in one industry towns and regions of urban decay like Detroit, Buffalo, Gary, Baltimore, Camden, etc , who are affected by outsourcing.    If trade is a two way street, where are the big chinese businesses on American Soil?    Countries are inherently protectionist because they will always want...  "we want our country to be the best!"   "we want to defend our country from foreign influences like culture, immigration, etc"  "we want some of our goods made here!"  etc    Also, Americans are more willing to outsource their industries to other states than to other countries because it is "American". Even then, states still campaign on a protectionist agenda during election times.   Like "Support this industry because we want to keep _fill in state_ jobs in this state!"    I love my representative and my senators but I hate yours.   You do realize that both regions share the same currency. Trade in the global scale tends to be determined through the global currency exchange market where the markets determine what currency is worth more or less than the other.    Which state?   No. Midterm elections are based on states. The last midterm elections was focused mostly on rural states. Democrats lost their chances with North Carolina, Georgia, and Colorado. (maybe LA and Iowa?) Those should have gone Democrat, if they campaigned well enough in the major cities. Cities tend to vote Democratic. Even then, those states are "purple" on the national level.    Nope. The House is gerrymandered from the 2010 elections. Democrats need to make sure that they don't lose the 2020 elections to reform the districts. History says the two major parties don't win more than 3 elections in a row usually.    We don't have a multiparty system, so it is based on some states. Also states tend to vote in the same way as they do in general elections.   Red States = Vote Red for Senators Blue States = Vote Blue for Senators  The majority knows that they will have them for 6 years.    Voters are shifting to the "unaffiliated" or Independent group.    If you really think Raigeki and HFP should be in the same format, i don't know what to say lol   Heavy Storm will come first because HFD is too op.    Gerrad will be high priced since Keane and Zardes will likely score goals from his passes   Super Vehicroid Stealth Union    July 4th since people usually think Baseball = America    I rather have seasonal games for those "holiday" games. I think Labor Day makes the most sense because it does take a team of players to score goals.    Labor Day? It will be a good holiday just to focus on all things soccer. July 4th already has competition with baseball. MLS will celebrate it as usual. Also, the holiday is during the fall, which coincides with fall sports season for many communities, schools, institutions, etc.    I think slowly transitioning is better to allow adjustments.    Ethan Finlay   It is interesting how when gas prices are too low, Oil companies say that they must close down some production because prices are too low and they can't gain profit as much.    Reducing the gas tax will not increase more driver traveling on gallons of gas on the road    Testing diff formation against a team that isn't doing too well ish?   What happened to the sane Rockefeller, Liberal, Progressive Republicans?   Easy way to defund highways. REPEAL THE FEDERAL GAS TAX, so the Highway Trust Fund has no revenues from the gas tax, so now you need to find an alternative revenue plan.  ^  Terrible Idea. Just saying. We should increase the federal gas tax by 5 to 10 cents.    Clinton only needs to worry about the moderates dividing up her primary votes. (Webb, Chafee, and maybe Biden). She also needs more progressives in the race to divide up the progressive vote from Sanders. The best outcome for Democrats is to find a candidate neither Clinton nor Sanders, so Republicans need to think of a new strategy in the general election, but not too leftwing for Republicans to play "moderate". Of course, Clinton is still a viable candidate. Don't get me wrong.    Dang it! I transferred him out for villafina    They are running attack ads on Clinton now so they will do damage on her in the general. In the general, Republicans will do the socialist fear-mongering on Sanders.    Haha. Don't believe them. Republicans want Bernie Sanders to be he nominee just like how Democrats want Ted Cruz or Donald Trump to be the nominee.   Weakness - too many resources wasted on just some synchros. And can't respond to many opponent's spell/trap/walls. Needs more consistency for it to be OP.    I wonder if there is a card which does this...... - Neither Player can Normal Summon Monsters.    Chainable to the 3 MSTs that people main to combat floodgates.    Maybe. if you could transfer out Toia for somebody else,  i think it will be pretty solid.    You could wait until the ban list is released, if you are taking a gamble on whether prices will continue to drop. Prices tend to drop over summer and pick back up again in the fall because people want to get rid of decks after national/regional events are over.   The question is do you need value it more in July/August or you can wait until the fall for Satellarknights.    Buy the Box because Secerts of Eternity Sets haven't been selling as much as other sets in stores. It takes time for the market to correct itself, when they realize that Infernoids from the set are good in yugioh. In my locals recently, I overheard management saying that secerts of eternity still has so many packs left that the yugioh community hasn't gotten rid of.    I am not sure, if you can tell, who actually needs it the most economically, since anybody can respond saying that they need it and write up life experiences. Either way, it is your call on the pick. haha  I could talk my about my interest for it and write an essay long reasons of why I would deserve it for reasons a,b,c,d, etc. But I want to say that I am a normal yugioh player. I do have cards, of course who wouldn't with all those commons/rares/and the occasional super from the packs. I have a roid deck from when I was younger, cyber, and batteryman deck, so it is not really "meta" per say nor beginner "starter" deck. This is my first 6 ish months of attending locals and I would say that it is a great way to meet new people, have a good time, trade with others, and duel others for enjoyment. It is a great experience, since I couldn't really play casually yugioh with old long time friends, who got away from yugioh with their own niche/interests, etc.  Anyways, you are a great person, who is willing to help other members of the yugioh community. Thanks for your support! (Flattering the person lol)      High-Density doesn't really occur until you have the population density and budget to maintain it. Business Growth will reach max demand when you have over 100k people with a good mayor rating with many services and high traffic congestion. The biggest problem is high commute time and lack of jobs when you are in high density mode. It becomes a problem because people abandon your city and causes a recession. Your industrial areas need to be in manufacturing + hightech mode as well.   I know this is out of the blue, but I think Boston should try to annex Brookline, Cambridge, and Somerville to make a semi circle.   summon in faceup defense lol   Toons    I have a feeling that Konami might make an extra extra deck, where you can play this type of card at any point in the duel, once per a turn.  	116
    Dimmwit.[sic] They are called Hyenas  But he had a bunch of unabashedly racist comments in other subs so I dished out a little mod abuse.  Edit: was pure troll, actually   No. No it is not.    What, no xpost to /r/sloths?   You're slippin' Gboob!   Really? You don't think vaccine deniers should be dismissed? Flat earthers should be given just as much credence as rounders? Phrenologists and psychologists put on equal footing?   Scientific debates don't care about your feelings and if you're offended. It cares about evidence. And those who refuse to examine it, and deny the reality of scientific evidence are in denial. Coddling them just devalues the meaning of "skepticism."    Banned for being a racist idiot who doesn't realize what sub he's in.    And?   Had they happened in a warmer world, they would have been even worse. The point is that climate change amplifies the impacts, and without it Sandy wouldn't have been as damaging.   It's pretty simple logic. Just because something happened naturally in the past doesn't mean man can't influence how it happens in the present.   There were forest fires before humans existed. Does that mean humans can't start forest fires?    not enough to cause serious problems  citation needed.  If I turn the temperature of my freezer up .55 degrees is my ice cream going to melt?  And if you turn it up .55F again tomorrow? And the next day? And then turn it up .65F the day after? And then .75f?   Because this warming hasn't ended. And with the CO2 we've already released, won't end for thousands of years.     BTW: [Found the paper](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2011JD016187/full) showing this is a false assertion, and [another debunking of this stupid meme](http://www.factcheck.org/2015/02/nothing-false-about-temperature-data/).    Maybe it's because the only ones you're aware of are the ones the deniers crow about. Because in reality the adjustments go both ways.   Paper showing that: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2011JD016187/full  Layman debunking of the adjustment conspiracy theory: http://www.factcheck.org/2015/02/nothing-false-about-temperature-data/    Yes!   http://www.rtcc.org/2015/07/21/wind-company-raises-300m-in-first-chinese-green-bond/  http://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/2015/07/17/pioneer-wind-farm-breaks-water-off-rhode-island-coast/30299301/  http://www.businessgreen.com/bg/news/2418471/offshore-wind-on-track-to-become-cheaper-than-gas-power-within-five-years-says-report  And those are just from things I submitted today...   We're edging closer and closer to that 2C guardrail.    Well there is ice on the poles, so technically yes we're in an ice age.   But the natural warming that would be taking us out of it takes hundreds of thousands of years to acheive the temperature changes we're experiencing in just decades. So no, it's not natural.    Uh, yeah, if you're going to accuse NOAA, NASA, et al of being so bad at science that their corrections to the record are actually not correct at all, nothing I can say will change your mind.   The fact is in the past things were measured differently (i.e. using buckets scooped from boats vs engine intake suction, or the biggest difference was when in the day measurements were taken. Morning and afternoon temperatures are pretty different, after all, and correcting for that takes no small amount of time or effort.)   Updating and correcting for those errors is an ongoing process. Science is iterative, not conclusive, after all.    For one thing, rising sea levels set the stage for a more damaging storm surge, as Hurricane Sandy broke records with a 13.2-foot (4 meters) storm surge in New York City's Battery Park, said Pennsylvania State University climatologist Michael Mann.  "At least 1 foot of those 13.2 feet was arguably due to sea-level rise," he said. That's because sea levels are 1 foot (30 centimeters) higher than they were a century ago, he continued.   More: http://www.livescience.com/24566-hurricane-sandy-climate-change.html   Probably much too small scale, though that trash island is huge...   [No, no it's not.](http://i.imgur.com/Zip5bLN.png)    ...They do it to be as accurate as possible.   And if you stop being accurate for fear of upsetting deniers, you've failed at science for a particularly poor reason.   The thing about deniers is nothing real scientists do will have any effect on their beliefs. That's why they're called deniers. They've concocted this whole conspiracy theory about how scientists are all evil marxists out to destroy the economy, and anything scientists do is evidence of that sinister plot.    See: Superstorm Sandy   I didn't say anyone was, just that it's a denier talking point.   And I use the term because they're different from actual skeptics, [who have made an explicit ask that we stop conflating the two groups](http://www.csicop.org/news/show/deniers_are_not_skeptics).    Yeah, there was a study at somepoint that looked at the full record and found just as many downward as upward adjustments, debunking that particular denier talking point. I can't find it now, but here's the next best thing, a researcher who looked into the adjustments (with some Koch funding) and found them to be legit. Even more, without the adjustments, the record would show even MORE warming than with the corrections! http://www.carbonbrief.org/blog/2015/04/prof-richard-muller-not-adjusting-global-temperature-records-would-be-poor-science/  Edit: [Found the paper](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2011JD016187/full), and [another debunking of this stupid meme](http://www.factcheck.org/2015/02/nothing-false-about-temperature-data/).

No risk, no reward!    doodle  What an understatement!    Well it's got 50 upvotes in 2 hours, so I think it's probably a fine title.    Maybe try actually reading the piece? The second 2/3rds of the story don't even mention climate change.   And sorry, but acknowledging the science on climate change isn't a political agenda.          The published title and a subtitle from the first line of the article...   How science is handled by politicians isn't relevant to (everything)science?   And how does it have an agenda? It's just asking experts whether and what kind of science questions should be part of the presidential campaign.   I'm at a loss as to what your problem with this is.                                        Adorable. Looks like an 80's sitcom granny.   See /r/shittyanimalfacts for further verification.    One of my favorite pics, for sure. Glad the title works with it!   The US is one of (and a leader of) the Arctic Nations involved. Figured since the US was involved it was US politics.

Just so long as freaking Mickey Mouse doesn't get it I guess I'll be happy enough.    My bad, I saw the link to the journal and thought it was to the study, not just the issue. Thanks!    Got to hand it to them, it's a clever plan. Say the government's ineffective, then sabotage it at every turn to ensure it's ineffective.    No, it simply said that the EPA should've considered costs when it was determining *whether or not* to regulate mercury emissions from power plants, as opposed to considering costs when it determined *how strictly* to regulate mercury emissions.    Don't tell Common Core that, because they used climate change as a basis for science from elementary through high school curriculum.   But I'm sure you know better than actual teachers.                            http://www.thelancet.com/journals/langlo/article/PIIS2214-109X%2815%2900093-5/fulltext                                 Scrooge McDuck style gold coin pool? I'm jelly!    lol, if they're worried about me wasting my time they'd probably get rid of the dart board first.    I'm confused as to why you think comments determine activity for subs beyond /r/askreddit and other specifically-discussion-based subs.   9/10 of all posts get zero comments. That was my point when I directed you to /all/new. Most posts die in the new queue, it's a fact of reddit, and part of the upvote-merit system. Judging subs by that is simply ignorant of how reddit works.   And the nerve you hit is the one concerning false claims with absolutely zero evidence.    I have reddit open while I work, and the moderator toolbox notifies me of comments instantly. Doesn't take much time or effort to respond when I'm not in a meeting or crunching on something.   (And as someone who grew up doing schoolwork while chatting on AIM, I'm used to switching between fun talk and serious work.)    Comments are an inherently weak metric for activity, because as this demonstrates, a massive number of comments could be generated by just two users (or one talking to themself) and would give the impression of a large amount of activity when in fact there's not. See /r/counting for a prime example of comments not meaning anything substantial.   Subreddit growth would probably be the best measurement, since that only includes new, active users (whereas subscribers includes some number of now-inactive subscribers).   So compare: http://redditmetrics.com/r/climateskeptics  to http://redditmetrics.com/r/climate   Or don't, and stop with the baseless claim that subreddits you don't like are dead. Just because you don't understand and refuse to acknowledge how reddit works doesn't mean you're right to declare subs dead.      So a subreddit with one post that, over the course of a month, has gotten 4 comments is more active than a subreddit with 100 posts with only an average of 2 comments apiece?   Yep, sure sounds like an accurate metric to me. Totally not one you've just made up on the spot to make yourself feel better. Totally.    Why are you limiting it to subs that discuss climate? And then why aren't you including /r/everythingscience and /r/oceans and /r/collapse and /r/green and /r/ecology?   Oh right, because you've chosen based on subs you frequent. Which is totally arbitrary and in no way a scientific approach.   But please, explain how subreddits with more users, more growth, more submissions and more upvotes than this one are dead...   You have been banned from /r/shittyanimalfacts.   Reason for ban: Disparaging the Slowbear.  Length of ban: Forever.   (not really)   Sadly, you probably *can* learn more here than on those cable "science" channels...   ...the biggest cherry pick you can think of is using literally ALL of the data?   Just let that sink in for a second. You just said that using the MOST comprehensive dataset is cherry picking. And using an arbitrarily defined subset is not cherry picked.   That's some straight up jiggery-pockery applesauce bro.    lol, silly me thinking to look at all the data and not cherrypicking things to suit the narrative.    [Subreddits where I have over 1k karma](http://i.imgur.com/1WmU6Gy.png)   https://www.reddit.com/r/all/new  Lemme know what % of those submissions get attention.    Haha yeah, I read the stories in the morning as I'm eating breakfast and taking the train into work, and then spend the 30 seconds it takes submitting the most relevant/important/interesting ones to reddit. Really not a time-intensive process and in return I get to see what smart or funny people have to say about the content.    Hahahaha, no, just go through the subreddit and write them down!   And be sure to post pictures when you go to the zoo!!    And? Most submissions across reddit don't get much attention, it's inherent to the front-page-browsing structure. But I don't see how you can think a sub is dead when it has lengthy discussions on a regular basis.    Lol I'm salaried and reddit's got nothing to do with it.       Well I guess it would if I had some kind of cool pay-per-karma reward structure.   But I don't, so no, just means fewer orangereds.       How do you figure either of those subs are dead? You have to go back all of a day to find [a substantial discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/climate/comments/3d75ko/how_do_you_deal_with_it/) in /r/climate, and [140+ comments in one thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/environment/comments/3d9dj4/startups_have_figured_out_how_to_remove_carbon/) in /r/environment. Hardly "dead"...      Um, maybe try reading the story and following the link [to the peer reviewed study](http://www.nature.com/ncomms/2015/150714/ncomms8537/full/ncomms8537.html) it's reporting on.    No conspiracy theories necessary. Just that others are regularly beating me to the punch in submitting stories, and in /r/science they only allow one submission per study.   For example, looking now and there's [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/3dda40/new_research_says_human_impact_on_the_oceans_is/) story, [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/3dd5hv/climate_change_is_increasing_stress_on_oceans/) one, and [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/3dd5ne/the_wildfire_season_globally_has_lengthened_by/) one today, so it's just that other folks are submitting things before I get a chance to.                                    That was more for everyone else than you, sorry!   (That or I was being super pedantic.)    Came here to say this.   It's my most upvoted comment, ever. For good reason.   Also, just for the record, when I made the comment it was italicized like a book title, not quoted like something someone said...                              http://www.sciencemag.org/content/349/6244/aaa4019     	148
    Special tip that I didn't include in this: I did find out from someone that FYI was not a part of my hiring process that the reason I got an interview was largely due to my selection of "open availability" that I marked on my online app. It wasn't true necessarily (I was in school). It's how I got the interview email so quickly I think.   Do you guys have any suggestions for where else I could post this, writing or reading wise? Already got it in r/Disneyland. Thank you so much!   Thanks for reading!  From another thread:  I turned in this thesis for my creative writing degree in May. More of a Capstone. I had to submit 80 pages of my best work that I'd created during my time at Chapman, which could include new work. This was orignally like 4,000 words of scatterbrain thoughts about working at Disneyland which I ended up inflating to a full-on submission. Didn't have to present it, but the committee read it and sent it back to me with some awesome feedback.   I always feel the same way regardless of the story.   Thanks for those great compliments.

I lived real close to Disneyland while I was in school. My buddy had quit at the same time as me and we were both interested in doing a show. This is right when the show only had like 10 or less episodes. We reached out a couple times, but never got a solid call back. Oh well!   Hi, yes I have. He didn't want me. I think he's missing out. Haven't listened since he didn't hit me back (3 years now?)   Parents just don't understand.   Maybe with that attitude.    That's so awesome.   Thank you all so much for the feedback! Part two is written (as stated, it's my thesis so I'm just translating it into episodes). I'll reply to all your comments with the link so you don't miss it!   -Happy skip   Put contact info in your bio (your email, and email that you create, don't matter it's up to you). I bet you'll be approached to sell that, especially if you make it easy with the contact info.

The boy needs treatment is actually a boy, young like 10 years old. Thank you for your response!   This is really, close, but my grandma says it's not the movie. I added more details in my description. Thanks so much for helping!   This is a movie I saw with my grandma about 2009-2010 I think, give or take a year or two past. We would really like the information of the doctor in the movie.   The mother of the boy wrote to the doctor because someone told her his job is to look for cures for illnesses without one. He replied "if you're willing to move here to Oregon with your son, we will try to find a cure."   He was successful in finding a cure, and at the end it shows the name and address of the doctor in Portland OR.

I never write for SEO. To begin, start getting to know the social medias better. Explore the different features and pay attention to what kinds of things show up in your feed (type of post, from who, when). Then read up on social media talk from social media marketing blogs. Then (fast forward) start by looking for jobs in "content creation" or "content writing".   I do. I write mainly comedic narratives, but also accrued a sizeable following on social media on Twitter and FB. I get paid kind of often for stories in a handful of publications.  However, I don't make any considerable amount of my income from the kinds of writing I enjoy most (including the stuff included above). Instead, I get paid as a writer for companies to do their social media.  It's more than that, because I also consult on soc media marketing strategy and lead campaigns for these companies. But I began as a writer, and any one of you can do it too. It's fulfilling to an extent because it pays me well and lets me write creatively. It flexes my muscles in writing engaging content and in different voices.  I began in college, and could do it because I already had a knack of writing on social media. Majored in creative writing and minored in public relations/advertising, so when I decided to find a job I just put what I could do with social media on my resume.

 I watched Clueless for the first time last week and found it very enjoyable.   It was released during a period of time when Disney wasn't making critically or commercially successful animated movies. Plus competition from Pixar, which had released Toy Story 2 a year before The Emperor's New Groove.   Jamesmobile!      The entire movie still amazes me to this day.   The visual effects were pretty good too.   The image is not from the trailer. Here's the source: http://www.stitchkingdom.com/disney-watch-pixars-the-good-dinosaur-full-length-trailer-hd-hires-75618/   Critically or commercially?   Source: http://nerdist.com/exclusive-shaun-the-sheep-movie-channels-daniel-craigs-james-bond-in-spectre-spoof-poster/      Thanks. It makes sense now.   It seemed like the worst part to me (because I didn't understand the joke).   I haven't. Link me.   Did anybody understand Liam Neeson's cameo? It wasn't funny and made no sense.   No. It is not being shown in cinemas here.   This looks magnificent...http://i.imgur.com/AUiIaRi.jpg   I hope so. I like him as an actor. He seems to be unlucky with most of the movies he picks.   I saw Ant-Man last weekend. Need a new movie for this weekend.   Still not sure whether I should see it this weekend.   Ryan Reynolds hasn't starred in a successful movie in a long time. I hope that changes with this one.   More character posters and a new trailer this week!   Sean Connery passed on many iconic roles: Dumbledore, John Hammond, Gandalf...   I used to often read them too. So now I'm looking forward to the movie.   Have you seen the movie?   Isn't he playing a good guy (R. L. Stine) in the movie?   Time to celebrate and re-watch my favorite sci-fi trilogy.   Very good choice. I hope he accepts the role.   I'm hoping they release the first trailer with 'Southpaw' this week.   I'm sure according to Hollywood accounting no movie has ever gone into profit, but are there any other well-known examples such as this one?      The official link: https://www.yahoo.com/movies/watch-chris-evanss-directorial-debut-in-before-124584943317.html   Don't forget about all the money Disney/Marvel made by selling toys and other movie-related stuff, selling rights to air the movie on TV, blu-ray/dvd revenue, product placement and partnership with other brands.      Source: http://www.comingsoon.net/movies/news/462717-vacation-photos-a-look-at-the-griswolds-trip#/slide/1      I see. In this case your statement was correct.   Marvel released many tv spots, featurettes and clips online. Not to mention a couple of trailers.   Doubling the budget means the costs have been recouped. For profits, a movie needs to make more than just double.   Guardians of the Galaxy (Aug. 1) had to compete with Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (Aug. 8): both targeting the same audience. In the end, both performed well though.      First trailers tend to be more popular than the following trailers, particularly if the first trailer was a full-length one. We've alreay seen a BvS trailer. The Suicide Squad trailer is the first one.   That was a very nice surprise ruined, but there is a lot more Falcon in the movie than I had expected.   There was no need to actively seek them. They're all on YouTube on a single channel. In fact I shared a lot of them in this subreddit.   http://i.imgur.com/xfKYdFx.gifv   3 years because Warcraft was at SDCC 2013, 2014 and 2015 and each time they showed some footage.   Yes, but they didn't release it online.   I know, but they could have released at least a short teaser by now. It doesn't have to be long. A 1-minute teaser trailer would have made me and many other happy. But all I can watch at the moment is the leaked footage, which doesn't look very promising btw. Although I'm sure the full thing in HD will look much better.   I meant releasing something online, for the fans that didn't or weren't able to attend Comic-Con.   The Warcraft movie has been present at SDCC 3 years in a row. Shouldn't they have released something official (footage) by now!?   Typical representative of the 'general audience'. It is mostly the fans who complain about too much footage, as they're the ones following the movie closely.   I know. I can only blame myself. I'm seeing the movie tomorrow. Then I'll know for sure whether I should have watched all those videos or not.   I suggest watching the 2 trailers one after the other. Then you'll see the difference. I only noticed it after watching both trailers several times.   A lot of the tv spots have appeared online. That's how I watched them all. Hard to resist.   The shot is not new; it is extended here.   http://i.imgur.com/ANBg6xn.gif   Did you watch all of them? I watched every single tv spot and all the other footage Marvel released. Some even multiple times. I hope this doesn't ruin the movie watching experience for me.   Avengers: Age of Ultron, for example, had 48 tv spots.   I just realized that I could have been watching BvS in a cinema right now.   At least there's one second of new footage.   I fully agree with you. This version feels too rushed and not as epic as the SDCC cut.  I don't think the Suicide Squad will get such a version. It was never meant to debut online, nor will it be shown in cinemas.

Posters, trailers and movie images are posted here all the time. If I hadn't posted what I posted, someone else would have done so.   Just following the rules: "Official movie posters are allowed.

 I used to always be one to check a movies rotten tomatoes score, or my favorite critic's reviews before seeing a film, but I've found that when doing so, It can alter my expectations for a film before seeing it. So now I stay away, but I have seen films that I normally wouldn't have watched if not for the positive reception they received. So, what are your views on this subject?    Just buy them Magic Mike XXL   Solid choice, defiantly either that or The Revenant   Just buy them Inside Out   what you don't want to watch 19+ hours of Minion fun?   If so which movie would you choose?   fuck you   One thing about this list is movies like The Revenant and Hateful 8 won't be getting a wide release til January   True, but you still want him because he's a great actor   Man, she can still deep throat a hotdog   Would love for Russell to hit the game winner, then watch the announcer eat crow.   I'm a fan of "DONT LET YOUR DREAMS BE DREAMS" myself   Fair enough    Could be about anything from Comic Con really, for me, Henry Cavill doesn't feel enough like Superman for me right now, maybe because I thought Man of Steel was just okay, but I wish he had a stronger presence I guess, anyone agree?   Whiplash, almost every scene has me on the edge of my seat will each viewing.   Yeah, it felt a litttttttle generic, idk what it is, just something needs to stand out, although I actually think the Joker looks good, IMO I think he'll be the best part and everything else won't be as good   The Social Network   I think my only problem with the trailer is that Superman didn't talk once (unless he did as Clark Kent in the one scene with Fishburne). After Man of Steel, Superman doesn't feel like that strong of a character, hopefully he can redeem himself in this movie but it may be hard due to all the new characters.   He's in MyPlayer mode on 2k   That's true    That's also true!   Is it just me or is his son a bad actor, maybe I just don't like him.   From the 1 billion dollars he was given in the end   Nope, guy here, true avoiding the face of the guy is a preferred, but if he turns up, I don't want to be looking at a crossover of Mickey Rourke and Sloth from Goonies   Who jerks off to porn with ugly guys, even if your a dude, have some standards   Ehhh, there was a lot of talk about an RG3 comeback while so many people were talking about the Cowboys defense being awful   Congrats on the future first round exit, don't worry your team is far superior to mine at the moment and has actually landed free agents, but still, fuck you and congrats   What if god was one of us?      To be fair, Clarkson spent all year with Nick and he seems fine   Yeah reading this again I have no idea wtf I was thinking..... ehhh fuck it In Mitch We Trust   BUT WE HAVE KOBE AND CLARKSON! Guess who hasn't been winning with that backcourt (I know Kobe's been injured), Kobe's got limited time left in the league, and who better to mentor our new young guard. Hopefully we pickup a free agent big to provide a decent season, plus Okafor is basically Brook Lopez without the jumpshot range, good but won't take you to the next level, In Mitch We Trust.   i have no idea   Now that we have Russell how would you feel about that?   Does this mean Free agent big man signing incoming?!?!?!  	35
 Its ok. I was there and we went through it together.    god damit.    Somewhere out there is a props guy that could help us answer this question... Maybe he uses reddit. That would be amazing.   maybe they just forgot the corner piece? I don't think they would put all that work into something thats on screen for a few seconds when they can just find it at the old props warehouse.    maybe the props department were just re-using old stuff.   I admire your shamelessness. Keep it up.      This is what they're saying...   Him: Its big  Her: HOW BIG?   Him: 10 and a half   Good, good. Hows Franky fat face? Oh that franky, always grabbing dudes balls. ahh good times.   Ron? Is that you? I thought you were in jail.   I just upvoted fucking casual.    We exist in a small corner of reddit known as /r/nofx . Decided to mossy on over to jokes to post this one. Nice to meet you.   I tried to see if I could recognize any buildings but had no luck so they must have filmed that scene in Pennsylania as well.   I'm also from Waterville. When I first saw that sign I was excited too. Glad im not the only one haha      I pride myself in thinking I know it all when it comes to NOFX and then you show me they have a beer. Had no idea. Thanks for sharing this!    Stick control comes with practice. But I used to put some headphones on and play with my favorite songs for hours. I liked to practice with jam bands like Phish cause they change tempo and rhythm and its a lot more fun than just pop songs that's just one beat for the whole song.   This is a big one. Usually very true.   Thank fuck its outside your window. I would set my house on fire if it was inside.   thanks for the heads up! Ill check em out.

Deff shitty ecr material though.    Honest question. What would be wrong with using this? My friend bought some of this and I added some to a 50/50 pg,vg juice and I didn't notice anything out of the ordinary.   That would look sick as tits, black and white or not. What color is your Sigelei? If its black, black and white is the way to go. But color would look cool to. If you do this I would love to see it!   Yea that's much more satisfying.    Thank you kind sir.   I think I've seen that one. Nice man!   what concert?   Found the sticker at a record store and cut it myself and it worked out great. I think it was meant for a bumper sticker so its also a high quality sticker.   Thanks man! I thought it improved its looks considerably.          same thing was said about gay marriage. Could happen.   yea that's a good idea. I think schools should at least teach both equally.

I have size 14 shoes. How many times do I step? is that 14 inches?!? WHAT DO I DO!? FUCK!   Well, Americans aren't really cool with change. People would flip out if our system was changed to metric.   yep.      I'm surprised it still works, I've played the shit out of it. Only NOFX vinyl I have though.    Nice dude!

They prey on the old and retarded I guess. Good job telling them to fuck a goat. love it.   we all know hes lookin. unless its his mom in that case your right.   Dont look, dont look, dont look... fuck.   I came here to point this out as well. Lets just hope its his moms instructor.   score. Reddit thinks I did good.   IT LOOKS LIKE A NIPPLE!! Did I do good?  	53
       Because you are making it all about money. Its not about money. Imagine if spacex and tesla started today instead. How far back everything would have been pushed. How much technology that came out of those companies so far that we would still be half a decade away from. Sure it would be easier to start those companies now but that hardly makes it a mistake what he did. He is pushing technology further than he could have sitting on paypal. And just because he lost out on a couple billion doesnt make it wrong. Its not idolizing to say that space was his passion and that he could have retired 10 years ago because thats the truth. If it was just about money he really could have retired a long time ago.            But they are dexiding on punitive damages this week or next. And that is dependent on your assets.   Its not just time, its also about paying less. And overall its just a big "fuck you" to rick ross.    He declared bankruptcy because he is getting sued over that sextape he leaked.  He has to pay less if he doesnt have any money on paper. He still has a couple stacks of millions laying around.    Humans are used to seeing in the visible wavelengths but some animals can see further out wavelengths and some cameras can see even more wavelengths. A wavelength is just a measure of how quickly the light is oscillating. Have you ever seen the purple glow of a remote control on your phone camera? That is because remote controls use infrared light. It oscillates too quickly for humans to see but a camera can pick it up. Well, turns out that all minerals oscillate and release some light at different frequencies. We cant see them in the visible spectrum, but they are visible in infrared. A huge camera that is made specifically to pick up infrared light can look at an asteroid that looks almost black in the visible spectrum and  it will see a glowing colorful ball.   Scientists on earth can then look and say, "hey remember a couple years ago when bob looked at platinum here on earth under this camera? It gave off the same light,  so im pretty sure that asteroid has to have some platinum on it."  Thats if you cant get to the asteroids. Sometimes scientists send satellites to the asteroid and those have more sophisticated equipment that gets closer. One thing they have is a xray or gamma ray spectrometer.  This is like when you break your bone and doctors can xray you to look "through" your skin. Except its doing with a whole planet.   Another thing that can be done is throw signals at the asteroids,  like radar, and see what bounces back. You know those super cool spy planes that absorb radar to hide? Well, minerals try to do the same thing but arent all that good at it. They leave a distinct signature and we can compare that to the analysis of minerals on earth. This method is newer though.

Op made it backwards   The internet is like roads in your neighborhood. Each website is a house. Anyone can go to any house and knock on the door and ask for some info. But then people learned that they could make a robot that could walk very quickly down the roads and knock on many doors to get info. Places like google can use their robot to find a lot of links and give you info about them when you search.   But some people dont like robots, so they post a file called robots.txt on the front of their door. Whenever a robot visits a house, he should first read this posting. It is a set of rules that tells the robots how to behave if they enter, and it can even ask them not to enter at all.   Now, this doesnt force the robots to listen because that would be difficult to impliment. But most well known robots will listen because if not, they can get a lot of negative attention. Kinda like laws. By writting a law and passing it, you arent forcing humans to abide, you are merely stating what is and is not allowed and penalties can come later of the rules are broken.   If yelp didnt want the google robot to visit their site, knock on their door, stalk their children, etc, all yelp has to do is put up a sign that says "google robot, you are dissallowed here."   At the top right you have an option to view sidebar. If you include any wiki links in the sidebar it will open them in the built in browser.    So does RiF   Also, when an account is shadowbanned their old posts are sent to the spam queue on subs. A mod can re approve all their old content.   I like this option. But then what standards do they choose for redacting and how do you made mods conform to those set of rules?   What's to stop a mod from using that one option always? If they want to censor sonething they can just say its personal info and it will be cleared.    Yes   He provides a shit ton of OC. Get off the circlejerk.

I can't stand having people try to "Teach me" how to whistle and then complain that it's "really simple"  That really captures the sentiment I feel and probably the one of those that downvoted you. Thank you for trying to help, but I still don't really get it and maybe I will after some more practice, but today wasn't the day either.    I get a small whistle out but it sounds retarded. Like, I kinda see how that would work its just that playing with the different positions doesnt give me anything better.    Yea not to jump on a engineering circlejerk, but I did EE and im interning this summer for 28 an hour.

If you double the amount of mirrors you double the reflective space you have and double the material required.   The sphere is a neat idea and the model is a great proof of concept, but theres a reason that it was implemented with mirrors on a large scale first and not with sphere's.    Drunk   Mom   Mom   Yea, I only have like three serious alts. The rest are just for lurking and stuff. Reddit doesnt control me   Just all the edgy or weird things I tried to do. I misunderstood a lot but would still try to have conversations with people about my limited understanding and adults always thought I was an idiot.   Like my sister told me that beer was urine bottled up and men drank it. So I believed her, because why would siblings lie? So one day at a park or something I asked a complete stranger why he was drinking urine and tried to have a conversation with him about how gross that was. He shooed me away and looked at me like an idiot, of course.   Or one day at a store I went up to a random dude and said in the loudest most obnoxious 10 year old voice "what is up doooog" cuz thats cool right? But I didnt say "sup dawg" like the cool kids at school, I said " what **is** up" and then said a long, drawn out, obnoxious "dooooog." My mom said sorry to that old man, sighed, and dragged me away.   Or the time I said, hey I am a strong independent child and can put my own seatbelt on. So I unhooked my seatbelt, got out the car and decided that I would get in on my own and put my own seatbelt on. But my mom didnt know I was outside of the car until she hear my screams from under it as she started pulling off. And then some CPS person talked to us and asked if I was being abused and I probably almost got taken away.   Or what about the time my uncle was getting married in Honduras so we all flew over and I was staying with some relatives. My mom got up early to go decorate the church. But I wanted to go with her so later that morning I got up and decided to walk about 2 hours through some of the worst part of town to get to the church but of course I got lost cuz I was fucking 8 years old. My cousin found me and drove me to the church and gave me a talk about the gangs and crime and how they kidnap kids that wander alone through bad parts of town.   I was a dumb kid.

It feels like 10 years ago everyone had to go and if you didnt you were a loser. Now it feels like, as more people realize it is no longer easy to support yourself with a part time job and go to school, it is become more okay to work for a couple years after highschool or do something else instead of immediately going to college.    Hey bby   What the fuck did you just fucking say about Reddit, you little bitch? Ill have you know I graduated top of my class in the Karma Whores academy, and Ive been involved in numerous secret raids on SRS, and I have over 300 confirmed golds. I am trained in League of Legends  and Im the top upvoter in the entire /r/funny forces. You are nothing to me but just another target. I will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this sub, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of spies across the 4chans and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your profile. Youre fucking banned, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred subreddits, and thats just with my main account. Not only am I extensively trained in vote manipulation, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the /r/conspiracy arsenal and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the internet, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little clever comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldnt, you didnt, and now youre paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it. Youre fucking dead, kiddo.   Unidan said it before getting banned.    Yea I remember seeing it on 4chan too and just skipping over it. The next day I saw the /r/4chan post and the links to all the news articles and it blew my mind. I remember him talking about how the kid would find her soon and thinking how fucked up that kid must be.    No, it actually gets more and more impractical as you get larger.     Doxep is people too   But no one gave cake away to him. Or me :(      Well, I guess you have a point.    If you compare the best from today to the best from a couple decades ago, today people are smarter, wittier, healthier. Like I said before, the issue is that everyone compares our average joe to the best that they remember from back in the day.   We get the benefit that history filtered out the good ones and thats all we see.   Take a current example, the new queue vs the front page. The front page has already been filtered for you, so if you passively enjoy reddit by chilling on the front page your perception of the quality is slightly higher. When I started going to the new queue and voting and interacting with recent posts, I realized 99% of what gets submitted is shit.  When you look back in history and "remember" the witty guys, what you actually are remembering is their hot page. And im not saying they werent smart, they had plenty of intelligent people, but our perception is still skewed against our current time. We are stuck in the new queue of today and when a song comes out or we see a new comedian try, we see all the failures with the additional occasional gem, and that skews our perception.    The reasonable solution   Nice   No, it has to be the gay thing   But, plz   Stop with the nostalgia bullshit. People are probably more clever nowadays. You just only remember the handful of smart, witty, clever people from 30 years ago but get bombarded with imbeciles on facebook daily.    Only if they are black. (Also sarcasm)   There's no reason to ever treat ANY ~~customer~~ one poorly because of how they look.     Enhance!!   Put your pitchforks down and enjoy the damn picture.

  Yes, some episodes in the novel read like science fiction and the title seems a sly allusion to the H G Well's classic.   Your reference to Disney's cultural free-riding suggests to me that the most profitable resources to plunder are the works and lives of others. Antarctica would be a new frontier, as are the moon and stars, but capitalism thrived by assimilating the worth and exploiting the weakness of pre-existing populations and cultures. For centuries, it has tapped the labor of people held in Malthusian traps. The trans-Atlantic slave trade and the Opium Wars -- now that is disruption. What would the patents to maize, potatoes and tobacco be worth to Monsanto? As we race to the bottom of a depleted well, I imagine there is still a lot to 'go-and-get'.      You are correct about its layers of meaning, and the details you provided show you read it with a keener critical eye than mine.     Have not read Fight Club, only saw the movie version. Do not understand the connection.   In E. O. Wilson's most recent book, The Meaning of Human Existence, he asserts that intelligent ET's should exist, certainly within 100 light years, but such complex biological entities are too fragile for sustained existence in space  -- as are we. He also suggests we, and other such beings, might reject the trans-biological adaption that is necessary to for such exploration -- Trans-humanism is human extinction. Only robotic technology can every leave its planetary home.  I do not understand why we would not discover the prior electro-magnetic (or other) signature of an galactic civilization well ahead of its advancing wave front. Surely, that signature would have arrived at least centuries ago. Perhaps, someone can provide a simplified and explanatory reference. Also, this VX Junkies reddit is a parody, right? For an aged, aged man, it is become difficult to distinguish parody from reality.   Thank you. I will place this book on my reading list.  The mass of any society might prefer stasis, if it were comfortable enough. Those of conservative temperament, in the cultural sense, should be its natural advocate -- their 'good old days' would be more permanent. Likewise, this would tend to perpetuate existing, hereditary elites. That is the downside. In contrast, Capitalism has always been to the disproportionate benefit of a would-be elite, one that is always willing to sell-out tradition and their fellows for advancement. These go-getting 'disruptors' view themselves as agents of 'progress', in multifarious forms, but ultimately, they can only accelerate an increase in global entropy.   Thank you. I was not confident in my source.   I was tempted to refute your assertion about the sustainability of Japanese society prior to American intervention, by which I assume you mean Admiral Perry and his Black Ships, in 1853. However, I first consulted this Wikipedia article: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographic_history_of_Japan_before_Meiji_Restoration#Total_population_2 and found that Japan had undergone a long period of population stasis. This is an interesting topic for discussion, especially with current Japanese demographic trends. Could you, or others, offer sources for further inquiry?   My vote for the heaviest McCarthy quote comes from the mouth of his classic sociopath, Anton Chigurh: "If the rule you followed brought you to this, of what use was the rule?" That may be inexact, as I have no copy before me, but it is a grim formula that can be applied to too many of life's outcomes.  	10
 I definitely feel like this book is marmite, people either love it or despise it :/   So I saw this book recommended on Reddit countless times and decided to read it. I'm 124 pages in and I have to say I'm not really enjoying it. I feel like the main character is really self absorbed and annoying and I find that I don't actually like him.   The problem is, I've only really started properly reading recently and I have terrible OCD with finishing books. I'd feel dirty if I was to put it down without finishing it, especially considering it gets such high praise. Maybe I just need to be more open minded about it? But then  again what's the point of reading if your not gonna enjoy the book. Does anyone know if this book picks up or gets better or should I just move on?  Thanks! :)   I suffer from terrible health anxiety also so I can relate. It's extremely tough being optimistic with obsessive negative thoughts related to hypochondria but I guess thats the challenge ahead of you. You will be fine though. In an anxiety book I read, the author stated that the two classic characteristics of an anxious person is that they expect the worse and they under-estimate their coping abilities. You will be fine regardless of the outcome, trust in your ability to deal with shit. Anticipation is the worst thing.    https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/3cw8g6/i_am_a_hypochondriac_who_has_recently_found_out/ Read that thread   Also, I once read a quote that I really wish I could find now that went like "how empowering it is for your deepest fear to become a reality, only to discover you are still okay" As a fellow hypochondriac, I really hope the best for you but always remember, even if it does happen, who cares. It won't define you, it's better not to worry and then get something than to worry your entire life over what ifs. When I was worrying about mine, I almost didn't care if the diagnosis was that I had cancer because I was so sick of worrying and being in the weird limbo stage. :)   Dude. I've had big lymph nodes in my neck for over 3 years. I'm also a hypochondriac and I'm pretty sure they originated in me constantly fiddling and worrying about it. I got scans and everything and it was nothing. You have no idea how powerful the mind is. Especially when you are a hypochondriac. Every time I worry about a disease I will look up the symptoms and then proceed to get every single one. And I'm not even kidding. I've had every symptom of every serious disease. My neck is riddled with lumps, I've had them all scanned and I'm fine. I appreciate the sentiment of your post and i think you are right, but I absolutely would not give up and assume you have cancer because you still probably don't if what happened to me is anything to go by.    Yeah I think he's part of a party who were following the boy and his dad throughout the book.    Make her lucky to know you   Think for yourself dawg!    Didn't the guy who shot at them with a bow and arrow take a flare to the face? Yeah I like that quote too.    The actual copy doesn't have quotation marks either. It's something I had to get used to and sometimes I found I got the characters speaking mixed up. If you can get passed that I recommend giving it another shot!   I can imagine. I'm young myself so I guess there's a whole new dimension to the book once you have kids. My only regret whilst reading it was that I didn't do it like you did and read it in much fewer sittings to get the full brunt of the bleakness in one go.    Thanks for the suggestion! I mean to. In most threads related to The Road I see people recommend Blood Meridian and No Country for Old Men so I want to read both of them. Although I might have a break and read something happy before delving into Blood Meridian.    Spoilers below.  So I just finished Cormac McCarthy's "The Road" and overall I'd have to say that I really enjoyed the book. I'd already seen the film which I absolutely loved but I don't think that took much if anything away from the book and I love both formats of the story.   Some of my favorite quotes:   "Go to sleep. I wish I was with my mom. He didn't answer. He sat beside the small figure wrapped in the quilts and blankets. After a while he said: You mean you wish that you were dead. Yes."  "We used to talk about death, she said. We don't anymore, why is that? I don't know.  It's because it's here. There's nothing left to talk about. I wouldn't leave you. I don't care, it's meaningless. You can think of me as a faithless slut if you like. I've taken a new lover. He can give me what you cannot.  Death is not a lover. Oh yes he is."  "Rich dreams now which he was loathe to wake from. Things no longer known in the world. The cold drove him forth to mend the fire. Memory of her crossing the lawn toward the house in the early morning in a thin rose gown that clung to her breasts. He thought each memory recalled must do some violence to its origins. As in a party game. Say the word and pass it on. So be sparing. What you alter in the remembering has yet a reality, known or not."  "In the yard was an old iron harrow propped up on piers of stacked brick and someone had wedged between the rails of it a forty gallon cast-iron cauldron of the kind used for rendering hogs. Underneath were the ashes of a fire and blackened billets of wood. Off to one side a small wagon with rubber tires. All these things he saw and did not see."  There are loads of more bits I love but I don't want to write all of them out :)  So I know some people complain about McCarthy's writing style and at the beginning of the book I felt inclined to agree. I found that the pacing and short paragraphs made it really hard to actually gain some momentum to read. So it took me a few days to get into it as I was only reading ten or so pages at a time at the beginning. But once I got more hooked into the characters and imagery it became a lot easier and I ended up really appreciating the short snippet paragraphs that the book is written in. I feel like it suits the style of the book. These characters are lost and confused living in a chaotic world therefore the writing style is similar, each paragraph isolated and separated from the rest with little continuity. I don't know if all of McCarthy's books are written this way but I felt for this book it really worked.    I loved the way in which dialogue was written. The short phrases and sentences between the boy and the man. Although they are not actually saying a lot. It feels that each segment of dialogue is brimming with meaning. I also found the dialogue quite refreshing because I'm quite bad at understanding or painting an image when reading descriptions which there is a lot of in this book.   I liked how short the book was. It felt concise and not needlessly long. Having just read the uncut version of "The Stand" it was nice reading a book that was way shorter but still as good none the less. Makes me realize that length isn't everything in books.   Lastly, I loved the dark themes of the book. McCarthy doesn't really hold back on anything. He's a master at making you feel utter despair and hopelessness with the suicides, cannibalism and general shenanigans going on in post apocalyptic america.   Anyways, I'd love to discuss more so if anyone has any opinions about what I've said or what they felt after reading the book please comment :)      Are you exercising? Because Exercise regulates adrenaline and helps keep it consistently lower. If you find time in the day, go for a run or do anything for 20 mins. Then afterwards have a cold shower. Guarantee you'll feel better afterwards.    I'm sorry to hear that :( Must suck when you don't like a doctor or you get nervous around them.    That's actually a good idea. I feel like I can't just say everything as soon as they ask. Would need a few days to actually think and remember how I've felt and make a list so I don't miss anything out. I want the diagnosis to be as close as possible. Thanks for the advice :)  	17
          This is breathtaking. I cant look away @.@   So I opened up the album of pictures without looking at what subreddit its on. I thought it was just another post on rateme. My point is, you are super cute. Passing? Absolutely.            A series I really dug, that's different than Cosmos, but in the same genre of science docu-series is "Brave New World with Stephen Hawking." However, by far "The Universe" is one of my favorites.   Omg you're adorable. Definitely the office cutie  And Happy Birthday!   You have an adorable smile   "Oh. Madison... You're... I thought you were... Um..."   Looks are just one layer of time character. The crunchy candy shell covering the decadent chocolate underneath. What's going to make or break the character for us, is Leto's performance. Of which I have more than enough confidence he can pull off.   I actually really liked season 9. It wasn't the same show, but it had a lot of potential. It should have been its own spinoff, as opposed to being tacked on to the end of the original show. The first time I re-watched the whole series, I was left wanting to see more of those characters. Season 9 may not have been as good as the first 8 seasons, but it could have been. Hell, it's way better than what they tried to do with the interns in season 8. Denise was the only salvageable part of that mess.   Since the season finale, I started rewatching Scrubs, and when it got to Toms first episode, as soon as I saw him I was like "he's not who he says he is!"   Haha, I thought so. However, your eyes are mesmerizing, and your smile is adorable. Whatever you're doing, keep it up. Also, coming from a former fellow emo-kid, even as you grow up, people of all kinds, tend to use that to generalize you. Don't be afraid to keep them on their toes. Let them make that assumption, but throw them a curveball every once in awhile. Leaves them thinking "wow, there's much more to this girl than 'hot emo chick'"   While teaching her how to talk to boys. Will he be able to contain his feelings?   but she didn't see this coming  	18

    If I recognize it correctly; this is off of Glacier Point - past one of the guard rails.   Dude...

Catholicism and its adjectival form Catholic are used as broad terms for describing specific traditions in the Christian churches in theology, doctrine, liturgy, ethics, and spirituality.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholicism  The major difference about Catholics from other Christians (disclaimer: I am a baptised Catholic, but not a trained or practicing one), is that they believe the Pope (you the one, ~~Dr. EverythingBeAllright~~ the guy with the tall hat ^^^^^St ^^^^^Peter ^^^^^was ^^^^^a ^^^^^rabbit that lives in the Vatican) speaks the word of God (or something similar), and therefore holds sway over the Catholic Church and its believers world-wide.  The reason people freaked out a bit about JFK being a Catholic, is that they thought that would mean that Rome could secretly control or otherwise influence JFK if he was elected.  A somewhat realistic fear based on hi~~s~~story].   Because there is more than one type/side of Christianity.      N-N-N-Nineteen   For me, its a problem with certain foods.

As an IT guy and wire-runner in another life, I always recommend to go through a place and check all the telco outlets.  Open them, and clean them.  Yep, clean the contacts.

I much prefer to give people the benefit of the doubt, but your comments are ridiculous.  Please take this to heart when you have conversations in public.   RemindMe! in 3 years   Its not just you.  They linked to the wrong size image.   I didn't say you comment wasn't in historical context.  I said you don't know what the fuck you are talking about.  My guess is that you are a teenager from New Zealand, and you need to grow up.  Either way, you need to grow up.  When you do, please come back and revisit this conversation in a polite and contributing manner.  I'd love to have a rational discussion with you.  Until then, kindly *fuck off*.   This.  I have discovered so many good songs/artists because of these unique Pandora features.   Slacker at one point took my preference, and I paid for it as well (even bought a hat to help support them), but they destroyed themselves imho, and I went back to Pandora.   This site gives you a decent baseline config, but is by no means a calibration - and likely has you turn off a lot of the advanced features of your TV that control picture clarity.   I'm replying based off of your fragmented storyline.  If I have misconstrued something, its because I started at the beginning of your story - not at the end.  Im not trolling.  I'm reading.  I have quoted your statements multiple times, and you did not specifically refute any of the quotes - so I continued with the assumption that there was nothing to correct.  Regardless of any of that, you still stole the phone if you did not get permission from either the giving or receiving party.  You took it opportunistically - i.e.,  you stole it.   I'd love to see you present your side of this argument to /r/logic.   We are talking historic context, and what bad can come of it.  You have absolutely no fucking idea what you are talking about.  Go lodge your complaint to /r/Im14andthisisWTF.   Try a close-match x6500 series monitor.   And here we go:  back to the classic defense of the sub, the hippie/communist defense.  Theft is theft, regardless of your socioeconomic agenda.    I don't work for the company that this phone was supposed to go to.  You work for the company that was handling what you stole from.  The final destination company has nothing to do with it.   Nothing empirical.  Only concerns regarding family ties and/or loyalties to the emperor.  AFAIK from what I learned at Manzanar, there were no discovered cases of Japanese-American disloyalty of any of the people interned or otherwise having served in the US armed forces during that time.  The problem is always with "concern" though, and the fear mongering that goes with it.  This was also on the heels of a lot of *"they took our jobs"* backlashing against Japanese immigrants.    If I may add a point, not doing well at something is not a sufficient reason to be racist.  Particularly not a reason to round up an entire race of people, force them to lose all of their possessions (only allowed to take a suitcase), take them out to the middle of nowhere (hundreds of miles from where they lived) and make them build their own "housing", keep them within a fortified encampment with guard towers, force them to sign documents with unclear ambiguous statements, ...   you know what - I'm just gonna stop here.  Manzanar was disturbingly close to a Nazi concentration camp.  I realize that a nazi comparison is strong, but in terms of US history, its true.  Hindsight always shows you at your worst, but its not an excuse for a "but" statement.  What we did was wrong.  There are not "but"s to excuse this.  http://www.nps.gov/manz/learn/historyculture/japanese-americans-at-manzanar.htm  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manzanar   If you find theft ethical, you have a moral compass that requires adjusting.  That is my constructed distinction.   You are obviously not Italian.  I would love to see my Sicilian grandmothers reaction if you said this to her.   Cool.  I'm confident you are all kidding yourselves, and are engaging in theft - not dumpster diving.   Exactly.  You are being selective about what you consider ethical.  So, whatever.  You want to do what you want, and take a blind eye to what you do not.  Which, coincidentally, is also unethical.    TIL why I call slow drivers fucking retards.    The U.S. Government was extremely concerned about this, and is an underlying reason for the internment camps themselves - never mind the related regiments.   Source: I have been to the Manzanar internment camp historic site and museum.   If you ever wants be truly disgusted with racism and your own government...  Make the trip and visit this site.  There are so many powerful stories you have never heard about.   Edit: fixing fucking autocorrects on mobile...   The [big crunch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Crunch).  i.e. no matter what we try to do, we are all fucked in the end.   My definition of ethics comes from the actual definition of ethics.  You however, are choosing to ignore to apply said definition because of a situation that you do not agree with.  You continue to turn this discussion into something it is not.   Oh, you got permission to take it then?  Because:   So, the deal is, I work at a facility with 50-200 people in it. We have these battery / old phone recycle boxes. Someone put their iPhone 5c in it. I took it home and charged it and it was already wiped of data. I rewiped it and am now using it.   If they don't bring in the torch while riding this, I will be sorely disappointed!   OMG, is this the little girl from Dune?    Mdchen  Isnt it closer to "maiden"?  Which could have several implications to meaning.   1. **OP stole from his employer**. Talk your way out of that ethically.  I fucking dare you to. 2. **OP intercepted property that was exchanged in a business transaction**.  The original owner made a choice of what to do with their property, and who to give it to.  It wasn't discarded as "trash".  It was recycled for a fee and with an intent.  You dont get free dibs on items that are still going through a business cycle.  OP is interfering with the recycling process for personal gain, instead of letting the related businesses thrive from the business.  This isnt dumpster diving.  This is stealing.   holy shit.  thank you for the update!   You are justifying based on your own selfish desires. You are avoiding the violation of two ethical situations posed by OP.   The question is of ethics. Turn it into something else if you want, but it doesn't answer OPs question fairly.    I wouldn't steal from the company I work for.    The CalFire rep said it wasn't affecting their efforts.  I couldn't really speak to any other possible details.  I realize some outlets are reporting it as a problem, but I havent seen anything from CalFire directly that confirms - only what the rep said yesterday that denies that they suspended any activity.   Interesting.  FWIW the ABC7 interview with CalFire was while the DC-3 was dropping retardant.  They specifically asked about the drone problem report, and the rep said it wasn't effecting their efforts.  \*shrug\*  edit: after watching that report you linked, I am not taking away the same conclusion that you are - that they are saying otherwise.  KLTA is sensationalizing the bit, and nothing directly from CalFire is saying that their efforts were actually interrupted.   Cal fire was interviewed yesterday afternoon about this by abc7, and said that they did not halt any aircraft assisting the cajon pass fire.   Although typically standard procedure to do so - they did not in this situation.    I thought it was that they never swear.    No they didnt.  I live in LA, and watched the entire event live.  ABC7 interviewed a CalFire rep about this (the drone), and the rep said that they did not ground any aircraft - although it is typically procedure to.  In this situation, they did not ground or otherwise prevent and helicopters or other aircraft into the airspace to assist in putting out the fire.  I'm not saying its not a serious issue, etc, etc.  But its untrue that any aircraft were grounded or deterred because of the Cajon Pass fire on Friday afternoon.   It's not a quote. Just a good allusion.    You are imposing your own sense of justice upon someone else - against their knowledge and/or wishes.   That is unethical.   There are ways you could accomplish your desires ethically, but OP is choosing not to do so. Instead OP is performing a selfish act out of moral righteousness.   I've been dumpster diving for 25 years.    I'm sure he feels tip-top, Tommy.   According to an interview on ABC7 with a fire dept rep, nothing was grounded in this instance.  no planes or helicopters were deterred in this particular situation - although it typically is policy to do so.   What you have done is unethical.  1. The previous owner left it with a specific company for a specific intent.  You are violating the wishes of that person. 1. You stole from the company your work for.  edit: ...apparently there are people that dont understand what *ethical* actually means.   Best of luck, everyone!    It is not the man who has too little, but the man who craves more, that is poor.  Seneca   Debauchery, uh...  finds a way!   Its not a matter of radar, as we arent talking military drones - we are talking about little RC quad-copter type drones.

I'm not sure if any ovens go up to 700, that was just a hypothetical :p      "Reeeeeeeeee"   Just communism doing what it does best. Ignoring people' opinions and enforcing idiotic rules and censorship.   Glorioush    You can just feel her desperately trying to lie to herself about what her dad thinks about her sexuality.   I think that one thing about CK2+ is that genetic traits are more likely to be passed on, so it probably has something to do with that.   I have heard black people called oreos by other black people though. Apparently it means someone who's black but acts white.   I love this sub.   Could another nation have explored it all and  the shared discorvery thing just kicked in?   It seems as though whenever there is a monotheistic religion introduced to an area it seems to dominate. We saw this in various places, such as Christianity supplanting Hellenic, Germanic, Celtic, and Slavic beliefs. We saw Islam supplanting Zoroastrian and African pagan beliefs, and we saw Judaism supplanting polytheistic beliefs in Judea. Why does this trend seem to also carry though history? As whenever Europeans colonized a new area of the world the natives seemed to usually convert very quickly. Is there a reason Monotheistic beliefs have so much more power over people?   It seems like most English words that have the plural that ends with IES has a singular that ends with Y, why is this different with movies but seems to be the case with most other English words?   Huh. Imgur seems to have gone ahead and removed those *"horrible fake racist facts"*   doot doot   You're thinking that Republicans would make anything much better.   Just because there were a lot of them doesn't mean they weren't centralized. When I say centralized I simply mean that the way the governments of those nations worked was by having a series of small scale administrators running the nation and paying nearly all of their collected taxes, men etc forward to the Emperor. Contrast that with CK2 Mechanics in which there are relatively few larger lords who take cuts of everything from taxes to levies. The closest analogue China would really have with CK2 mechanics would be having the Emperor control all of China in his demense, but due to the nature of CK2 that just wouldn't work.   And keep in mind, it's a religious text.   Honestly the Feudal aspect is why I don't think it would work. At the time of CK2 China was operating under a centralized Empire rather than a Feudal society. The reason I don't think China would work is because they didn't even have Feudalism (at least not in the sense of Europe and the middle east)   You'd think such a smart person could think of a better way to put it.      Yes. I can finally raise my armies of polar bears and send them to conquer all of Europa!   North Korea mode and/or just won a great holy war for a kingdom like Germany.   'Tis 'Shopped.   I was just stating how I assumed /u/iwilllurkreddit pronounced it without any 't' sound. Of course I don't pronounce it that way nor was I saying that is how it's pronounced.   Nah - Zee? (without any stop between the two sounds)   It's a neat game, but there are way too many bugs and not much content. I'll be sure to check back in a few months and see how it's doing though as it does have a good concept.   Must've, weird. I can't access it either so \\__()_/   That'd be awesome if they did. I'll go and research this a bit. It'd be awesome if I could convert my games considering at this point I play HIP almost exclusively.   HIP is a mod, I don't think the converter is supposed to support it (unless that's a feature advertised for the mod which IDK)   But why is it a 2048 clone?   Exactly   Democracy at its worse.   Alpha as fuck.   I'd be uncomfortable sitting next to this guy at a mcdonalds.   I'm frankly more confused than anything else.   That's what guys who like that sort of stuff tend to look like...   Plot twist: It's a friendly dolphin helping the dog return to shore.   They both do, but HIP only adds more provinces, not any new areas (There's no Persia or India either) whereas Lux Invicta expands the map to include a lot more of Africa/Asia. What I thought you were asking was where the even comes from, which is the VIET events thing (I forget the full name) which is a part of both modpacks. If you're wondering what mod OP is using in the picture, it's Lux Invicta.  	42
 Trout out of the lineup, day-to-day with heel soreness. Get rested Mike!   Never saw that one; added to the reading list. Thanks for sharing!   It does not assume all of his actions are those of a patriarchal racist; it *argues* that his actions are those of a patriarchal racist. That's an important difference, and it's not at all a claim made without evidence.   It does factor in Atticus's gender and skin color; it certainly doesn't reduce him to it. I think race just might've played an important role in TKAMB, don't you? Doesn't that make it worth talking about?  In what way is this begging the question? It makes a statement and provides a good amount of textual analysis to support that conclusion. That's not begging the question at all.  You're not wrong for reading it that way. I find this reading more compelling. I'd love to discuss it with you and everyone else, but it doesn't seem like you're interested in that conversation. The whole point of posting this is to have that conversation, not to downvote it into oblivion because it proposes a theory we don't like hearing.  In what way is him wanting to keep Scout in permanent childhood baseless? It's certainly not explicitly stated, but it's not at all baseless. And how is that the reviewer being bigoted?  I really don't think you've thought this through as much as you say you have.     Explain to me how the article is bigoted, not seeing that. It's certainly not on the apotheosis-of-Atticus side of the fence, but that hardly makes it bigoted.  The two books are separate; that's how they've been published. It's not being advertised as a first draft of TKAMB. If anything, it's being advertised as a sequel. Moreover, you can read it as a first draft of TKAMB or as a sequel or as a separate entity without being wrong. Books admit multiple readings.  EDIT: look, I don't agree with everything the article argues, but that doesn't mean it's not worth discussing. It's a really interesting viewpoint at the bare minimum, not without merit. But I'm getting a strong fuck-that-noise vibe from the downvoting, which doesn't seem to be the way to go about dealing with things you disagree with.   I hope those downvoting at least read it. There's nothing in here that seems worthy of downvotes, but maybe I'm biased.      I love Torii to death but why on earth would we do something like that   I only want someone who's going to be useful going forward, or at least has that kind of upside. The only names that have intrigued me are Jay Bruce and Carlos Gonzalez, but it all depends on the ask. I'm totally content going forward with what we have.   He's been hitting way better past couple months. Depending what the ask was, this could be awesome IMO.   Got a chance to see him play earlier this year, his approach looked really good at the plate. I'm stoked for him!   So I left my desk to poop, and when I came back it was 7-0. What just happened.   I like the change regarding being able to move the best 2 seed out of the best 1 seed's region, even if it's their natural geographic regional. Wisconsin not getting a 1 last year and getting bumped to Kentucky's region would've been a travesty.   That was also a really good Louisiana Tech team, so it's not like you lost to someone bad.   That sucks.   Jerry signed Blanton because Arte made him sign Hamilton and he had no money left over for pitching, which is what he wanted to spend on in the first place.   Link?   Would that be neat though? That sounds awful for that guy.   God the team's reactions in that clip make me so happy.   He crushes low pitches. More than anything else, that's what makes him so good. He feasts where most batters struggle.  You can see Hanigan set up even further away on that one, and when it came back to the plate Trout didn't miss.   I really want to see some extended angles from it too. Watching the replay, looked like there were some quality reactions. Hanigan, Trout, Uehara, and whoever Trout turned around to look at in the Boston dugout...I want all of those haha.   He destroyed that pitch too, thing was gone off the bat. Second hit of the night for the team.   Revere is a terrible leadoff hitter. No OBP skills at all.   Walker's throw to the plate is bad too, but notable mostly because Trout dodges it while sliding on his back. First time I saw the play I thought it hit him in the head, or at least upper body   "Like many fly fishermen in western Montana where the summer days are almost Arctic in length, I often do not start fishing until the cool of the evening. Then in the Arctic half-light of the canyon, all existence fades to a being with my soul and memories and the sounds of the Big Blackfoot River and a four-count rhythm and the hope that a fish will rise. Eventually, all things merge into one, and a river runs through it. The river was cut by the worlds great flood and runs over rocks from the basement of time. On some of those rocks are timeless raindrops. Under the rocks are the words, and some of the words are theirs. I am haunted by waters." -A River Runs Through It   Also, favourite   I do not want this, not one bit   Twins   I think it's more that he's been talked up as such, rather than actually been one. He's a good player for sure, and I love watching him play, but I do have the distinct feeling that he's been around a long time haha. From afar, it does seem like I've been hearing his name a lot for a long time. Probably just relative to other guys.   I feel like he's always either jazzed up or depressed. Maybe I'm just remembering like one time where he got excited and it's dominating my mental image of him.  Also that Twitter account is gold haha   Yeah Dakari is awful. There's a reason he's 7 feet tall and barely got drafted.   Fair enough, I just interpreted it as attempting to say more than it did haha. Interesting observation for sure, might say something about the myth of needing an ace to go deep in the playoffs.   The A's have been insanely unlucky this year. They have a positive run differential, and really have played quite a bit better since their catastrophic first month. But, when you dip to 20 games below .500, you aren't coming back from that.   these angles are right angles, homie: we pointing STRAIGHT UP   As everyone seems to be saying, depends on asking price. If he comes at a good price, pull the trigger.  Personally, I'd rather us get Jay Bruce from the Reds, but he'd obviously take a bit more doing.   Did you analyze how far the teams that didn't win got in the playoffs vs. how far they were expected to go? Is your sample size big enough to be statistically valid? I find it incredibly hard to believe that getting better pitchers does not make your team better.  Whether or not it's worth it depends entirely on who you acquire, how long they're under contract, how much that contract is worth, and who you give up to get them, among other things. Certainly a debate worth having. But getting better players seems like a pretty black-and-white plus.   IT IS WRITTEN   What about getting a great pitcher hurts your chances at winning the World Series?   After this weekend. Then, I'll allow it   1. EDIT: I'll buy it, he's just normally more excited. (thought he was out of the game at that point, he was not, I'm a derp)  2. Never knew Home Run Tracker was a thing; thanks for passing it along! Completely unsurprised that was the second fastest homer this year, thing straight jumped   Your request has been noted and forwarded to the proper Trouthorities.   They just got there too haha.   Does this chart count Hamilton towards our numbers? Cuz other than that, we've really been fortunate with injuries thus far.    Pirates   CHOO CHOO   Thank you for responding reasonably to that. A lot of KU people get angry when us non-KU fans feel like Perry has been around forever. It's absolutely this, he's just been talked about all 4 years as a key piece.   3rd best, behind the Astros and the Royals. But still!   Two things:  1. Why does Shoe look so sad in that?  2. I really want to see Statcast for Mike's homers these past two games. The Tuesday homer's exit velocity had to be way up there.   We snapped our absurd streak of RISP impotence and all the sudden it's raining runs.   The Angels have won 9 of their past 10 and 5 straight. The bats have finally clicked into place and this team can't keep track of how many they've scored. All year lineup depth has been killing us, but the bottom half guys (Aybar, Freese, Iannetta, Joyce even) have started to hit like they're capable of, and all the sudden we've taken flight. The pitching has been excellent. The Astros are cooling off, and we're only 1.5 back.   It's really nice to start playing like we're capable of.   They're cooling down now, within a game and a half of first!   Hopefully he thinks it's tonight 8)   Keep the ball down Shoe, just keep it down   Me too man, me too.      The statistics do not show that. It's a myth.   Wholeheartedly agree with this sentiment. Am mostly just commenting in the hopes that MLB sees this on here and adjusts accordingly. Cmon MLB!   His stroke was so smooth and clean. Doubles all day for GA   Once again, you're not wrong. And once again, if you think MLB is doing anything that will invalidate billions of dollars in TV contracts, you're also wrong.  It's the right way for them to move going forward. But there is so much money to be made now that they won't do it until they have to, until there is no viable alternative left. Channels and cable companies both view sports as one of the few DVR-proof offerings they have, so they're willing to pay a premium on it, and they'll probably continue to do so for a few years because they have their heads in the sand regarding the shift to Internet content.  You're absolutely correct in identifying the trend. Where I think you're mistaken is in both how long cable companies are going to be willing to throw huge dollar amounts at sports (IMO, a few years left yet), and in how willing MLB is to move on from these contracts while they're still being offered (answer: they won't.)    The Jim Valvano/NC State 30 for 30 is called "Survive and Advance", not "Survive and Dance", just so you know. It's a great one though.   Angels   I see what you're saying, and ultimately you're correct, it's the way things are moving in the long-term. But if you take away MLB.tv blackouts, you will see these billion dollar contracts for teams shrivel to pennies on the dollar, because they will not be nearly as valuable when available legally online, and for a price that's impossible to compete with. They are not going to kill the golden goose until they have to.   He's been quoted recently more or less as a maybe. But Pujols doing it will be a pull for him. Would love to see it.   Number of comments in the thread is 1 larger than the number displayed.   Seriously. I'm still giddy when I think that we got Santiago and Skaggs for him.   Yeah, I agree. The player vote took Fielder, which is totally justifiable. But A-Rod is having a great season so far.   I'll let you in on a secret: that first half is the only time Trumbo was good. Other than that he was slightly above average every once in awhile, all the way down to atrocious.   Aybar getting a vote! .550 average, 1.495 OPS in the past week. A huge reason our offense has clicked into place all the sudden, Hopefully dropping him back to 5th in the batting order is what he needed. He just seems to feel more comfortable there.  Also, he hit his first-ever homer to CF against the Yankees last week, and it was the winning run. Right after Albert tied the game two pitches before too, back-to-back :)  http://m.mlb.com/video/?content_id=214840083 game_pk=414814   I for one, am stoked.   Lol, all that means is that Ned Yost didn't choose him and the fans didn't vote him in. That's far from "most players and coaches" dude.    as /u/jigokusabre said, baseball is a local product. Teams negotiate their own local TV deals, and in that they are able to sell exclusive regional broadcast rights. This nets them quite a bit of money, as I'm sure you know.  If you were to take away the blackout rules, now those regional broadcast rights aren't exclusive. The value of non-exclusive rights plummets, because there are quite a few people who subscribe to cable/satellite TV packages in large part because they want access to their team's games. Many of those people would become cord-cutters, or at least feel a strong pull to do so, if they could just pay $100 to MLB.tv and get all their team's games.   It should be A-Rod, but it will likely be Prince.   Source? I've not seen anything near a consensus on that. I think most players and coaches don't want to touch that one.   Knew this was happening once he got selected. Would love for him to get Trout to do it now too, because their bromance needs more national attention.   He went with his player, almost every All-Star manager does it. Personally, I would rather have seen Hector than Huston. He's having a hell of a season.   Only time I've ever been to Chicago was the last weekend of June a couple summers back, for a paintball tournament. Holy hell the humidity.   But you guys have a really cool city!   Boxberger wasn't a brutal selection, but I didn't love it. Herrera straight up shouldn't be in the game. Too many other deserving candidates.   Last time I felt this way about an Angels player it was Mark Trumbo. Haven't felt that way since he got dealt   Oh. Oh my. I'm so sorry.   Player Ballot, not fan vote.   Well, you guys did manage to snap Sale's 10+ K streak of starts.   Reds   Indians   Well I'm glad you've gotten an opportunity to see it from the other side haha. Now if only we can all take these lessons and think about them the next time it happens to our team, then we'll be getting somewhere.   That strips contracts of their social and cultural contexts. That's why contracts were invented, and obviously there are still times today when we need them to enforce previous agreements, but many contracts nowadays are signed because it's the de facto way to consummate an agreement.   He's drawn my eye with that stat line out of the gate. Love it!   Soooooo....is Pedro even saying anything here?   Nats   I'm a little more willing to wait. He's super freaking young.   Well assuming the player who has a markedly better career line than Harper but doesn't hit well in the postseason exists (I'm not sure that person does, Harper is a stud), I guarantee the data will show that that player's career line is a better predictive major than his postseason line.  I understand the point you're making, I just don't see anything in the track record that supports it, at least on the level you're claiming.   Honestly, I think that works against your point. Yunel Escobar is 8 for 19 in the postseason in his career. That's a small sample size, but also excellent performance. Why do you not want him up there? He's hit over twice as well as Harper in the postseason by batting average. Is he not clutch until he proves that he isn't? Why?   Personally I agree. I absolutely want Harper up there, even though his career playoff numbers aren't as good as Yunel's. But you're wrong in saying you can't quantify that info. I absolutely can. By career slash line, Harper is a much, much, much, much better hitter than Escobar. And that's why I want him up instead of him, despite the fact that he has a career postseason batting average of less than half of Escobar's. Because I believe that career slash line is a much better indicator of his ability to perform in that spot. In short, because I don't believe in the predictive ability of the clutch hits that Yunel has gotten.   I'm not saying you can't classify the hits as clutch, I'm saying you can't infer that based on having gotten hits in those situations in the past, you will get them in the future. (Ishikawa I think btw).   The reason you need sample size on these things is because that's how you determine whether or not such a phenomenon is actually occuring. The smaller the sample size, the less confident you can be that what you are seeing is the result of anything other than random chance. It's like the old flipping a coin thing. If I only flip a coin ten times, there's a very good chance I will end up with a ratio that isn't 5 heads and 5 tails, or even 6:4/4:6. But if I flip a coin 1000 times, there's a very very very small chance that I end up with something that is proportionally far away from a 1:1 ratio between heads and tails. Just because there are relatively few high-leverage/clutch opportunities compared to other types of statistics, does not mean we get to throw out the rules of statistical significance.   I'm jelly. He's only been to California once since I've been a fan, and I saw him. Really hoping he tours again soon.   Trust me, I've played sports haha. The answer to that is sample size. 5 games is not nearly enough to determine that a dude is clutch. As soon as there's legitimate, statistically valid evidence for clutchness, all aboard! But not til then.  Haha, these are still anecdotal examples. If you look at the data, you won't find evidence for it. Also, Sandoval is playing terrible right now. So is he just only good in clutch situations? Seems like he should step it up every day. And Kershaw doesn't turn into a bum; Kershaw gets left in the game too long because the Dodgers bullpen is so bad. He throws too many pitches, the opposing hitters see his stuff too many times, get settled in, and boom he gets roasted late.   This stuff slices the other way too. If Harper's so clutch, how come he's a career .200 hitter in the playoffs? Why does he only get on base at a .268 clip in the playoffs? Either he put his clutch socks on to hit those homers and mysteriously forgot to wear them in 2012, or those events aren't explained by his clutch quotient.  	93
    Of course it affected the local peasant, your crops were gone, your village sacked and your wife possibly raped if you were found outside of the walls. But it was not a outright death sentence like a longstanding war. If your village was close to the local castle you were screwed for a time, but the peasants still managed to live own, i'm not saying they did not suffer any adverse affects but the total destruction of a person's lifestyle was not so complete they could not recover plus peasants were frequently "conscripted" which also if they won the battle was a good way to acquire some nice arms and armor to sell if need be to rebuild.       Mercs in actuality. Most medieval armies especially during the 16th century onward or any century past the crusades of the 12th century were mostly made up of foreign mercs    True. local pillaging of villages and stealing of crops or torching them was also a huge issue, but you're forgetting one thing, that's only local which would be the villages in a radius at best of maybe 20 or so miles, the besieging army would of course send out foraging parties but only effected the local area. While some sieges could take months or even years, most did not last that long, a besieging army has one major issue, it cannot decamp, it cannot move and it is stuck until the castle is taken and  the countryside for the most part was left intact. You're overestimating the damage of a besieging army on the local landscape, the worst part of any war is not the battles, sieges or skirmishes across the country side, the worse part of any invasion or long standing war is the presence of marching armies. Now a marching army might not sound so destructive but consider this, you have lets say 7,000 men, hungry, some drunk, some pissed off others missing their families and home, the food is crap in you're constantly on the move. What are idle soldiers want to do? busy themselves with pillaging, that's why the hundred years war was so destructive, not because of the constant warfare but because it created lawlessness, chaos and their was always the old score to be settled, without oversight you had lords sacking their own kingdoms towns with no recourse from proper authorities.   very few armies had the advantage of the enemy kingdom/nation not having a army that could launch a offensive, most were under a set time span to take the castle, leave a garrison to hold the castle and fall back to their own lands. Winter sieges would be horrid for any army, there are plenty of famous instances of armies mutinying after extremely horrid sieges especially if they were not being paid due to lack of logistics with a strong supply line.   If a siege took longer then a few months, by that point yes your life as a farmer was screwed, because the war would continue for years onward but most sieges did not last longer then a winter campaign.    Those are wars not sackings or long campaigns, a sacking in this sense would be the equivalent to a king taking a castle but not marching further for an outright conquest, most medieval wars were sieges not open field battles which would cause more damage to the country side.   Either-way it all comes down to how long the war was.       This needs to be in not the onion.       Stalin purged the Bolsheviks(including his right hand man who was a jew) the majority of whom were jewish, yes stalin was a paranoid idiot who was always fearful of allowing others to gain power but he also had a deep seated hatred of the jewish people, most Russians did and do, they have always been scapegoats, just look up the pogroms the soviets conducted against regular non Bolshevik Jewish communities. Sorry i'm trying to finish a paper but I will source the link where it is mentioned this stopped his forward mobility in the party rank's, btw the quote in question was pre-Stalin era, this is in reference during Lenin's rule.    Yeah after the golden age during the civil rights movement with the continued economic and political upward mobility of American Jews we kind of had a bad break up. It's bullshit though, of all the minorities in this country blacks should be the least anti-Semitic jews went through a lot of the same crap we went through from discrimination(the only difference is Jews took it as an opportunity, when they were denied jobs and entire professions they headed west in helped found Hollywood) racism/ethnic discrimination and slavery(regardless of how you feel about biblical claims their have been 2 well known verifiable instances of Jewry being enslaved once with the Assyrians and the romans) yet we allow stupid conspiracy theorist, in idiots who claim to be afrocentrist yet when you ask them about the kingdoms in western Africa our direct ancestral homeland they pop a "what's that" fuck those guys in the idiot protesters who have Ferguson/Palestine bullshit comparisons.       Obviously you have never been Ridiculously wealthy, upper middle working class are poor compared to ludicrously  wealthy rich people like george lucas in the kind of people who get pissed off at george lucas.   Source? damn it i'm a propagandist not a historian jim!  Oh wait actually i'm both.   More about the largely vacant desolate land of Israel "Palestine" in the 1800s - massive Arab immigration following Jews' return = the true origin of the (today's) so called "Palestinians"  How odd that such last names as al-Masri (the Egyptian,), al-Djazair (the Algerian), el-Mughrabi (the Moroccan), al-Yamani (the Yemenite) and even al-Afghani are so common among those claiming to be "Palestinians."  Today's Palestinians are immigrants from many nations: "Balkans, Greeks, Syrians, Latins, Egyptians, Turks, Armenians, Italians, Persians, Kurds, Germans, Afghans, Circassians, Bosnians, Sudaneese, Samaritans, Algerians, Motawila, Tartars, Hungarians, Scots, Navarese, Bretons, English, Franks, Ruthenians, Bohemians, Bulgarians, Georgians, Syrians, Persian Nestorians, Indians, Copts, Maronites, and many others." (DeHass, History, p. 258. John of Wurzburg list from Reinhold Rohricht edition, pp. 41, 69).  There are villages populated wholly by settlers from other portions of the Turkish Empire in the 19th century. There are villages of Bosnians, Circassians, and Egyptians. -Parkes, James William, History of the Peoples of Palestine, Hammondsworth, Great Britain, 1970, p. 212.  There are very large contingents from the Mediterranean countries, especially Armenia, Greece, and Italy, Turkomen settlers, a fairly large Afghan colony, Motawila, immigrants from Persia, tribes of Kurds, a Bosnian colony, Circassian settlements, a large Algerian element, Sudanese -Encyclopedia Brittanica, 1911 ed.

Surprise tel aviv came from this swamp land thanks to the tireless effort of zionist, now the arabs want to "reclaim the land" they sold at b.s prices because it's nice and all built up.     Yeah crap, feel retarded right right now, trying to finish up this music history class and debate Jewish topics is annoying.    OP it's my bday, screw that complete set crap, lets get wasted reddit style.    lolz i know just wanted to fuck with your statement. But yeah their is a generation notion of how people see jews, common traits, nose, fro/curly hair, their is definately some features common to jews but that does not always denote anything look at scarlet johannson a regular blond bomb shell yet she is a jap(jewish american princess, even supports israel and advertises for soda stream)   Not really. The concept of a Palestinian is recent, the majority arrived from jordan,egypt and Syria respectively. Their not that diverse and they came in the 1800's. You can look at the majority of their last names in it shows their origins. Stop trying to state they date back 2,000 years that's a lie used by arafat a egyptian from cairo with a syrian uncle who was a nazi.    God enough of the arguing. Being a jew was settled in ww2, it's an ethno-religious group, if you dislike this idea of it being an ethnic background as well  as a religion go take it up with the concentration guards. I'm sure isis,hitler and the various other antisemitic movements give a crap if you identify as an ordinary white person they would have still killed you just like the rabbi or the owner of the kosher butcher shop.    Yes. That's how the han chinese can tell one of their own from a Uighur and vice versa yet if i go to china my first thought will be all of them look alike no offense to the china men:)    Arab refers to speakers of arabic, most of the middle-east is arab and that does not denote ethnic origin 90% of Libya is actually Berber according to genetic studies yet they're denoted as Arabs due to the 6th century arabic conquest. It's more then just a different religion the majority of Palestinian arabs follow Sunni Islam, they do not all come from the same place, they arrived from around the Levant from jordan,egypt,syria and lebanon they also interestingly have a number of eastern Europeans mixed in.   Also, a new study concluded that the Druze harbor a remarkable diversity of mitochondrial DNA lineages that appear to have separated from each other thousands of years ago. But instead of dispersing throughout the world after their separation, the full range of lineages can still be found within the Druze population.  The researchers noted that the Druze villages contained a striking range of high frequency and high diversity of the X haplogroup, suggesting that this population provides a glimpse into the past genetic landscape of the Near East at a time when the X haplogroup was more prevalent.  These findings are consistent with the Druze oral tradition, that claims that the adherents of the faith came from diverse ancestral lineages stretching back tens of thousands of years.       You would name call me for a cordial post? not really. Catholicism proselytize and so does Hinduism, they want converts and more people to embrace their religion. Listen i'm not stating all jews agree, i've seen and been involved passively in many arguments over how jewish is defined, it's fine if you disagree i'm not trying to put you in a box i'm just going by how i've seen it and how my jewish friends explain it to me which is this:  Jewish is the ethnicity/culture you can be born into and are still apart of even if you leave Judaism the religion. Theirs a notable difference.  Like i said if you don't see yourself as Jewish, that's perfectly fine, your not the first of your ilk to define yourself apart from the religion and culture and you want be the last. Rachel dolezal decided to stop being white, i can stop being black_ racist. lol except if you're a muslim then you could be killed for it but i digress. Either-way not saying people can choose new ethnic backgrounds, what i'm stating is for the majority even if you choose to no longer follow Judaism under jewish law you're still considered jewish.  Karl marx converted to Christianity from Judaism he was still considered Jewish, Trotsky refused to consider himself a jew even to the detriment of jewish people, when a rabbi pleaded for his assistance he refused stating in communism their is no religion. Yet he never attained any higher status in the party because stalin refused to allow a jew into a higher position despite the fact he did not self identify or even recognize himself as a jew or having anything to do with being jewish.  Like i said before you can refuse, you can assimilate, you can be that white dude from Philadelphia but theirs always going to be somebody who will state you're still a jew. That's why it's an ethnic background, i can't stop being black, i can refuse to acknowledge my black identity, cultural identity and stereotypical norms associated with being black in america but guess what i'm still black.  I can understand hating the idea of something forced upon you but theirs certain things we cannot change, you're not a jew according to you, that's great but i don't think that gives you a right to declare it's not a ethnic identity because you don't want to relate to it.      We're all genetically related. But no i did not forgot to mention this, because it makes little to no sense, a german jewish or polish family is not related to a polish or german family, jews collectively rarely strayed from their own during centuries in europe, if they did they were ostracized by European communities.   I have no idea how they're related closely to kurds but druze make sense because their homeland is the golan and lebanon, both close to Israel proper so their ancestors probably go back to the hebrews or Phoenicians which were cousins to the Hebrews.    Actually he kind of reinforces the ethnic argument even more and how Judaism is more then just a religion, you can stop going to synagogue but you're still a jew, in no it's not because hitler would of thrown you into the oven regardless if you got rid of your kippah it's because being Jewish is your culture, it's your heritage, your background. You can stop with the dreidel on Hanukkah but you know you want some matzah ball soup, if not then you're a lost cause already.    Jews don't refuse, allot of american jews actually have begun marrying outside of their own ethnic group, which has gotten the orthodox in a pissy move and have for decades going back to the early 1900's, which is what pissed off the germans, the germans became fearful the jews were trying to assimilate after claiming for centuries they hated them because they always refused to assimilate anyway this is in part what led to the holocaust.  When jews become apart of the larger culture theirs always a fear among jews that they will lose their respective heritage, religion etc that's why it's sometimes frowned upon by certain jewish communities but never outright hostility, most jews just prefer to marry other jews, i'm black, my mom prefers i would marry a black woman, my sister is now dating a white guy and she's cool with that too now, same concept really some people just like the idea of being able to relate to their childrens future spouse, having their grand children raised in the same culture/religion etc in i have no issue with that as long as you're cool with them coming back one day with someone completely different from your background and still loving them equally.   In jews don't care to spread judiasm, in actuallity i believe donald trumps daughter not sure got married a year back and married a jew, she converted(ivana trump?) she talked about how hard the conversion process is and that's for a reason, it's not because jews dislike converts they just want them to convert for the right reason and not because they married a jew, i'm not familiar with the entire process so any jew's on here or converts please chime in but i believe that the rabbi refuses them 7 times or something like that during the conversion process to see if they're committed to it.   Note: previous comment deleted so piggybacking unto yours buddy   Race is a social construct, we're humans, in you're lucky in south africa you almost would of been considered "colored" by their standards of the time. In brazil black people would be considered mix due to our white slave ancestors who impregnated slaves, light skinned black people would be considered mulatto's in parts of the Caribbean etc. Ethnic designation is not the best method but it's better then the concept of raced base on physical attributes which can be seen across the globe in various ethnic groups, take for instance Caucasian features found in Ethiopia, whites say obviously we put our genes into them but the reality is the other way around and they came Africa like most of the world population.   Actually according to genetic studies most ashkenazim(jews who reside in europe are all 5th cousins or something like that) and mizrahim/sephardim(middleeastern/north african-spanish jews) are closely related genetically with Jews to the point their is no genetic difference, sharing close genetic traits to kurds/druze more so then their arabic cousins. Jews are a ethno-religious group but american/European Jews also frequently see themselves as "white" instead of Semitic, Israeli Jews depending on their ancestry the majority are mizrahim/Sephardi so they would see themselves as more semitic/middle-eastern before white though technically Semitic people are Caucasian either-way the three major groups of jews are all Semitic people descended collectively from the tribes of Israel in genetic testing has shown this repeatedly.  Ethiopian Jews better known as beta Israelite are Jewish by conversion most likely but in Judaism a Jew is a Jew regardless, the moment a mother converts and her children are born they're as Jewish as any other Jewish child born to a family spanning centuries. Same for new converts, the closest to any type of discrimination i have seen from jews against other jews would be during the early years of israel when the mizrahim/sephardim first began to show up after being ethnically cleansed from arab state's, but due to the intermingling/marriages and the mizrahim quickly outnumbering Ashkenazim due to mass immigration, along with Israel having a draft so all Jews end up meeting other jews of different ancestry, theirs not any social or ethnic barrier. I believe the current estimate is in 10 years or so all of israel's jewish population will be collectively mixed to a point where the idea of ashkenazim/sephardi/mizrahim will be meaningless since the new generation will have grand parents from poland, morocco, france, germany,iraq,persia, turkey, egypt, Syria etc it's actually a beautiful thing.   Context. Stating the Jew implies something different then saying jews, jewish or we're jews. But it's all about how you collectively phrase it.    This is actually not that uncommon, looking back at history, the NAACP was founded by a number of Jews and kept going by Jewish donation's, the freedom riders who were lynched during the civil rights era were Jewish, Jews also fought in the anti-apartheid movement. It's one of the reasons why i support them as a black man, that plus i'm kind of a atheist agnostic in i surprisingly find allot of common traits and interest with Jewish people despite their religious culture/history, the only people i know who don't seem to have this collective hive mind mentality that i see is unfortunately common even among my own people(by hive mind i mean collective reasoning, cultural bias, outrage at certain things etc without taking time in trying to critically evaluate it individually instead basing their opinions on what the majority is stating or doing). Jews on the other-hand are something else:  Theirs a saying that goes, if there are two Jews in a room they have 3 different opinion's. Lolz    Funnily enough, Samuel L Jackson was not acting with this role, he actually used to be a crackhead. He once stated the reason why he stopped smoking crack was because he enjoyed acting more then drugs.  http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/3641237/From-crack-addict-to-the-biggest-box-office-star-in-the-world.html   [Spoiler alert](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfQJp8RgzHY)    My dick.   To elaborate why have all examples of Marxism and it's spin offs failed to achieve any of the long term goals expressed by Karl marx, why are the only successful examples of socialism found in capitalistic countries?   lmao i'm 21. If i get married this early shoot me, like ha fuck that. SOME PEOPLE BEING THE OPERATIVE STATEMENT! so lets stop insinuating this 1960's pre second wave feminist bullshit about a stay at home wife who has been a loyal virtuous saint who raised the children while emotionally supporting her bread winner husband mythology.   It's becoming less based on facts, in with the rise of third wave feminism demonizing the stay at home wife role, we should really begin moving away from the idea of alimony when most families are two income households. I can't put financial protections in place in states where they disregard prenups like california, which is utterly bollocks.   Exactly i never disagreed with the fact she decided to not be a scumbag, but i think people who feel they're entitled to half of my accumulated networth can get bent, nothing wrong with that. I was not referring to her idiot, i was actually giving examples, you assumed instead of reading. In that's the problem when anyone can be awarded half your wealth on such a archaic bullshit notion of marriage in these modern times, the woman who gets screwed over by the dead beat ex husband should be just as pissed as the husband screwed over by the wife, this is not about women it's actually about unequal enforcement of the law based on gender which all people especially feminist should be fighting against.   Heather mills was a two faced bitch who took advantage of a broken hearted man for her own personal whims, the fact she's even still showing her face without being ashamed is an utter fallacy. Gold digging and bums are a sad state of any society, fuck them man or female, now stop being a sexist pig.    Also to address your stupidity. You have zero idea of how their relationship worked or what role she had in his career, wealth and success. Maybe she did nothing and contributed to his stress, which directly led to him eventually divorcing her.. you don't know. So how about you stfu and acknowledge that she did something you morally might disagree with instead of just trying to put her down.   What we do know however is she married after the fact of his success, he was rich before, in he is more popular in the uk then she was end of story. Those are the only relevant facts. Eitherway i was not attacking her i was attacking people who assume the divorced wife/husband who wants alimony automatically should get it.      Until you have control of the private industry, then you come for our garden gnomes    He means he's going to fuck your couch and then take it, damn commies.    Radical left like radical right is wrong, you're radicalizing abstract construct, theoretical solutions and other ideas that when implemented in reality never work out. That's why they're theoretical, in theory socialism, marxism ok honestly just marxism socialism is crap, is awesome but in reality it has never once been implemented correctly, we're inherently fallable.      Lolz that's equality. Men feel pissed off when the opposite happens, it's bullshit eitherway but if we're going to keep up the myth of the 1960's era where women stayed at home in raised the little ones then both sides will suffer. Eitherway i'm cool with both.   Exactly that time was the 1960's now all women know how to do Is twerk it seems. Lets change the laws stop the bullshit, if you're a bum then that's your own fault.    No on reddit everyone can't seem to fathom maybe people are referring to the non stay at home, non committed spouse who did nothing either emotionally, physically or financially and actively was a detriment to the marriage. Jesus the sad thing is you support women who do this then bitch about equality while using the 1960's b.s view of a woman who contributes to the household by cooking and cleaning/raising kids when most of you can't make a pack of ramen lmao  Lets be honest here most relationships are far from a idealistic scenario, if a woman contributed to the marriage in some tangible way pay her but the notion she can get paid just for marrying a guy is bullshit. It's the exact same thing as kevin federline, most guys will call him a bum, however according to these comments most women would support him if he was a woman and that's unbelievable.   Once again the majority of women who marry successful men are usually successful themselves, they're not stay at home wives/mothers they have nannies, the women who help or contribute to a successful marriage financially deserve the money, especially if they were their for 30 years but a woman who did nothing or a man who did nothing but spend the wealth is a leach. Lets stop acting like this is the 6th century where women are in the house barefoot raising, oh no wait even then they had maids to raise the children.   lmao yeah because heather mills was a cooking, house keeping wife to paul fucking McCartney. Are people this delusional most rich lay about wives/husbands are welfare recipients relying on their rich spouse who contribute nothing but a siphoning of their material wealth.  	43
 This will kill me y u do dis      Ouch. When he starts smiling after the loss   hmmmmmm... yep im dead   Louis Ck if he never became successful   Is this one of those japanese game shows?   He looks sad since the demotion   I better sit down dude  You're sitting down  ok   It has been an eternity and i long for the feeling of affection, to care about my meaningless things, be loved or touched by someone but i can't get out. I really start to freak out wondering if i have broken my brain, gone too far. Would my sober life now consist of me being stuck in an asylum. I am now a nutcase and this weird feeling of everything is driving me crazy but there is no escape. I soon come to grips that i am powerless to change these facts, so i might as well make the best of it. Fuck it, this feeling is good and i am good. It is what it is, everything that was and everything that ever will be. I started to feel a nice sense of comfort with this realisation, all my trip buddies are feeling the goodness and are good. I think to myself this is why i like them so much, slowly everything starts to calm down as i begin to pick the pieces up of my sober life. I realise that i am going out later, that it is a saturday; tomorrow will be sunday and so on. time finally exists and I am free to do whatever i want.  I can relate to this so much   I sometimes get so busy and stressed that I spend even an hour just sitting down and thinking in a circular pointless way trying to remember what should be done as if I am always forgetting something. I feel stuck all the time so I resort to just focusing on one thing for example studying for a statistics exam. Eventually I get into a thought loop where my mind wanders and then I forget about something important and I just feel frustrated. This has been happening for 3 years and I have been failing college as well I don't know if this is related. I feel like I have a disorder or somekind but would like some input.  -Sincerely hopelessly confused person   (   )   What is good to sign up for in Australia? I dont have enough to pay to ESEA is out of the options.   I would swim through piranha infested waters with 45 pound dumbbells tied to my scrotum using Rosie O'Donnell's queef as my only air supply just to shake the hands of the janitor who works for a man who sniffed the chair you farted on three years ago  i would drag my penis(foreskin pulled back) through 10 kilometers of broken glass mixed with cat feces just so i could smell the open anal cavity of the janitor who 10 years ago washed the dirty clothes of some random homeless person that one time walked past that beautiful woman at the local cockfighting ring where they slightly made eye contact with each other.       dog got stabbed   he is ok      twat      So he's edging?   Option A: Take a break and process the experience  Option B: 50mg of DMT!   Sound distortion sounds like 5meodipt, what kind of DMT was this? was it from a trusted source?   You da real MVP   did that still doesnt work :(   Yes :/   Should I buy changa or DMT crystals which one is overall bang for your buck and simpler? I have a light bulb vape for vaping the DMT. Is the dosage confusing for changa? Apparently blue lotus is infused with it and it is only 50% so it is really confusing me      belize  http://i.imgur.com/1N4gUah.jpg   Dwight material right there   "I absorb the world as I see it"   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLT5_2AV664         or are they a temporary solution, how does this work?   What about if team A bets skins to say a total of $1 and team B bets skins to a total of $1 and if your team wins you split up the winnings by 5 so 40 cents worth of skins each. It would motivate me to play competitive more since I am actually winning something rather than just trying to rank up. Also people will play to win rather than play for points/kills. This idea can also get interesting when bigger bets come into play say $300 knives.         *Ireland Now*   "This ought to impress them; for once I get some attention my big break :'D"   Im 120lbs and I heard that low doses of DMT seem to almost always induce a bad experience and that trippers should go for a breakthrough dose such as 30mg-40mg and that it isn't scary once you are in the experience. I am aware that it is one of the most potent substances and my only experience is with acid and shrooms. I want to test the waters since I don't know what my reaction to DMT will be like.  What is your suggested dosage? to those who are experienced with dmt   What about if team A bets skins to say a total of $1 and team B bets skins to a total of $1 and if your team wins you split up the winnings by 5 so 40 cents worth of skins each.

Shrooms is the best anti-depressant in my experience.    Tripping all the time in an effort to stave off feeling the symptoms of depression would be as counterproductive as any mindless drug habit   It seems to me to be a treatment rather than an addiction since the positive effects lasts for weeks after taking the psilocybin.   http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/30/opinion/sunday/can-mushrooms-treat-depression.html  It's more of a relief from depression than a numbing escape from it.   why?   I've noticed that doses of 1-2 grams of shrooms really does wonders for my depression.   I started to think; why don't people just do shrooms all the time?   I know that tolerance won't really allow it of course; so what about once a week?    Easier to dose accurately.  idk about that i have a scale that goes to the 0.01 and i still cant get an accurate dose   yeah to be honest mushrooms were the same as 4-aco in my experience. 4 aco was a bit less mindfuck and confusion. The come up was quick so it makes you less nervous much like how throwing you into cold water is easier than anticipating the cold water beforehand.   in fact i think psilocybin converts to psilocin anyway?   since i have depression and have tried both and am not sure which one would be more effective at long term treatment   Can that mean that you are not getting the full experience of mushrooms? since not all receptor site affinities are being activated  since i have depression and have tried both and am not sure which one would be more effective at long term treatment  in fact i think psilocybin converts to psilocin anyway?         "Damn what the fuck"  "Ok how long into the trip am I?"  "The trip lasts about 12 hours"  "One two, three, four wait what comes after 4 what does 4 look like? Wait what?"  *looks at the clock*  *clock doesnt make sense*  "Oh for fucks sake I'll lie down"  "What if I am an old man in a wheelchair when this trip ends?"   its like an electrode that can release pleasure chemicals   Yeah I mean those studies where they can keep on releasing dopamine every time the mouse presses the button so he gets pleasure out of it without having to take a drug.   http://www.reactiongifs.us/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/homer_cereal_fail.gif      I see, and this gammagoblin is on blackbank?    Im rather inclined to think that the stoned ape theory also applied to him as his brain took on both healthy but maybe also unhealthy mutations.  how so?         I was laughing the whole time, i think i am getting immune to cringe  this is the office material right there   Apparently for fumerate its 30mg but i heard that fumerate is 3x more potent so does that make the dose for freebase 90mg?  Also how can you tell if you have fumerate or freebase? I have black sticky waxy stuff with a vinegar smell and a bitter taste.      user temptotosssoon  posted this               On mushrooms that is, I tried many different doses and every trip is just psychedelic confusion in a sort of dream state i've tried 1 gram, 3 grams, 6 grams, 14, grams  Has anyone tried shrooms here and have you ever had an alternate dimension alien intelligent being machine elf type experience?   I wonder how much dopamine is raised by 1 hit of LSD since the dosage weight is so small (1mg is enough to make 15 people trip)   I wonder how much dopamine is raised by 1 hit of LSD since the dosage weight is so small (1mg is enough to make 15 people trip)   Jesus?

"Keep on maintaining confidence in everything you do"   "Come on Brad its always good to make friends"   i dont know why I am getting downvoted just because my opinion defers from the norm   I'm not saying it doesnt work for everyone of course everyone is different but after going on 90 day streaks multiple times and experimenting I find that nofap and noporn have no effect on my life whatsoever.   If anything; it has a negative effect overall in that I am unable to sleep due to high libido as well as being unable to focus on work or college. My usual routine is pmo once or twice a day but I will keep it at once a day and I will try to cut out porn if I can.  Women are still attracted to me whether I have fapped all day or am on a long nofap streak. I perform the same at college as well. I guess this is good bye to nofap but I will return every now and then to check out how people are doing.   Good bye :)   what market?   he da real mvp edit: literally   sounds like something gareth keenan would say   Do you know if it is pure?  Do you know if it is acid or could it be a research chemical   As an experienced tripper; my advice would be to listen to music and let your imagination take over.   Ok I might be in denial. I feel better now compared to when I posted this. I guess the next best step is to buy a bong and never use a light bulb again.   After a lont time I started to learn a couple of truths about life. Ive been thinking a lot and some important thoughts have been crossing my mind..  Anybody else think that "happiness" is overrated? We have a climate problem + we have overpopulation with 7 billion monkeys on the planet. 80% of these 7 billion live in poverty and misery on less than $10 a day. 20% who live out of poverty are overly consumeristic and unhappy.   I think old ideas of "happiness" dont apply. I think a revolution is going to come soon in the form of either war or natural disaster and it will be about survival more than the petty "american dream".  I think studying 5 years of your life for a degree and then throwing your resume into a pool of other resumes only to find out that either the job sucks or that you can't find a job because of unemployment is a path that too many people are taking.  The last topic I would like to discuss is love. You may find that special someone and spend the best years of your life with them and you will be happy or you may find that your partner is only there to take advantage of you and ruin your life in terms of divorce and child support.   I dont know why I am rambling. I could be completely wrong. But I just wanted to discuss these topics.      I vaporised some weed in a lightbulb (I had cleaned the inside so there is no toxic coatings etc). I kept on heating it up with a candle just to make sure that all the thc will get out even though it already looked used up. Some black smoke started coming out with a really bad smell and as I inhaled I felt sick and dizzy and even now (1 week later) I feel like an idiot as if this caused me some brain damage. I feel sick like I could pass out at any moment and I have been like this for 1 week now. That black smoke looked really toxic as if I was breathing in a car exhaust pipe. Is all damage caused by smoke healed and reversed over time? I feel like I was heating up and smoking ash and burned sugars :/. All of this just to make sure that I dont waste thc :(     	91
             It looks like a healthy beluga to me.  They're known for being very fat (which helps with the cold) but also very flexible (which I'm sure is helpful when you have to navigate through sea ice), which gives them a smushy appearance.  Something may have happened to it that may have caused a scar to form there (certainly isn't a fresh injury), but my guess is that that's just the way this beluga's fat rolls meet when it moves its head like that.  Definitely one of the most interesting cetacean species :)                  [Link to the paper mentioned in the article.](http://jeb.biologists.org/content/218/13/2030)            [Link to paper mentioned in the article.](http://jeb.biologists.org/content/218/13/2030)     	16

 i don't know if it was intentional, but i loved the way the word 'shots' seemed to be repeated a lot towards the end.  it was like a secret build-up to the actual revelation that they were actually shooting people.  also, the tone was kind of funny, in a good way.   Who said you could die? Not me. No, you don't have permission to die yet."  My boss was a real asshole.  You kids today, you all think the world owes you a living.  Well let me tell you something, when I was your age I didnt mouth off at work and complain to everyone about how many stab wounds I had or where my insulin was.  No, I took it like a man.  You can die on you own time, but this is work and you come here to work.  Now get out there and takes those orders  Welcome to nnn Burger World.  Can I take your uuunnn order?  I kept cringing over the pain in my stomach from a lunch that had probably been tainted.  My boss, see, he fed us all the recently expired burgers and special sauce for our lunch breaks.  And only half price! hed say.     this is one of the best stupid things i've ever read.     Hey said some guy Id never met before as I was walking alone through a foggy alley filled with needle drug users and ominous men wearing trench coats who kept handing me brochures about how wonderful South Korea is and how nobody ever gets trafficked there.  I could tell this guy was creepy right off, probably because of the nametag on his shirt that said hello, my name is: creepy.  Is your cell phone charged? he asked.  Well, it has like five minutes on it still.  You know, just enough time to make brief contact with someone in case I was in trouble, but no so long I could explain specifically what was happening or where I was.  Would you like to come back to my house, no questions asked without letting anyone know where you are?  Sure! I said.  Next thing you know, I was blindfolded in the back of a car.  This is just like a surprise party! I said.  The blindfold only came off when I was in creepys apartment.  The walls were plastered with pictures of butts.  Looking more closely, I was horrified.  Hey!  What are all these pictures of my butt doing on your wall!  Well, creepy replied, its better than looking at your face.  Listen, are we going to do this or not?  He was brandishing a butchers knife now.  I do believe a thirty second head start is customary.  Fine, but I get first stab. Agreed.  AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHH!!! I screamed.     oh my god i love this.   maybe they do need me... i never thought of that.   agreed, but i'd say a dog is more for personality.  when i retire, i plan to pick one up from the SPCA just to keep me active.  support your local shelter!   Just what my daughter said!   i'm guessing the creep who lived in my attic and i had the same bus route.   i've got a cockatiel now.  they don't really talk, they just whistle.  he's a pretty good alarm.   it's happened to a few people around the world, so i think it's a pretty universal fear!  	11
 I created a fake account for shits and giggles.  I basically made myself into a  hideously undateable, underemployed, heavy smoker with addiction issues.  I wanted to see if I got unsolicited replies from hot women.  Yes, yes I did.  The site is a fucking joke.   Hm, probably have man hands on that keyboard.   I think your handsome in a 'professor' looking kind of way.  I like the beard, goes good with your shaved head and the glasses are nice.  Maybe consider making an appointment with your family doctor and telling him how you feel?   I've read what you had to say, re watched the video and you're right, he did point to the side walk area.  I stand corrected.  I don't know if he was necessarily deliberately getting her out of the view of the camera or if he simply wanted to deal with her off the roadway.  Either way, you're correct, he told her to go over there.     You look good.  The little hair you kept on your chin, it suited you.      By her own admission on a video she posted five months before, she said she suffers from depression and PTSD.  I can't pretend to know what's going through her mind, but those two illnesses can drastically change ones mindset.  I'm not saying her arrest was lawful, just raising the possibility that she may have still been ill.   It's pretty clear to me she chose to walk in the direction she was walking and wasn't even looking at the cop when she walked off camera.  Watch it again.  She's literally walking off camera by her own volition and isn't looking at the cop.    ...and he'll have to convince a judge / jury of that.   They did follow through with the charges.  She plead guilty.  That's the definition of following through.   The legislation is clear when it becomes illegal and the courts have made multiple rulings further clarifying it.     Police shoot every single person with a knife, unless they're a chick?  You sure about that?   I'm an ex smoker.  Smoking is fucking filthy.   Nicotine gum, snus or even better, quit.  CTC does not owe smokers a smoke break.  I'm not allowed to leave ( and re-enter) for a benign reason, neither can smokers.  Smoking isn't an emergency.   Yes, I understand.  How is a smoker being denied a right to smoke?  Smokers are fortunate CTC even allows smoking on their property.   I've a 2400 sq/ft home natural gas furnace and finished basement with a 5th bedroom.  Two Tennant's in my basement, I'm single and 3 kids 50% of the time.  March $150  April $130  May $126  June $118  I am on gas equal billing, so I pay $87 every month.     	17
    Humor? You think the continued fight against Hitler is **Funny**? Intended for **Japery?**   Seems like a Dick to me.   Nah, that team built the sturdiest and most consistent bot in almost any robot fighting tournament, Behemoth, but they had to scrounge something together in 10 weeks because robot wars owns the license to that bot (it was used in toys/action figures in Britain) Radioactive is stupid, but that doesn't make them idiots.   Not to mention the fact Icewave lacked the ability to do anything when flipped over. People give warhead shit, but it lasted the full 3:00 against two bots that would have take Icewave out in the first 20 seconds.   it will be satisfying seeing them lose next week  That's what everyone has said every week...   It seems like most of the teams could have benefited form watching season 3 , considering that was the season everyone began to counter flippers with self righting mechanisms.   Why would you want to take the chips *out* of the salty greasy paper wrapping?   It kind of is for batman, as well as new readers who started with the New 52 and weren't reading incorporated.    You're always pretty justifies in shooting the *Literal* god of Evil.   Eh, it doesn't take away much from Snyders story though. The whole point is that Batman doesn't know that the joker knows, so when he finds out it's kind of a big deal.   You forgot to mention the blair witch project.   Y'know how after the fight the guy says "Well that was fun" in a really twee way? Well, If you're versed in british passive aggression like me you'll know that that remark is basically telling they're leader that he was right that it was a stupid idea to go against tombstone with that bot.   I think Gareth Evans realized he'd essentially just remade [This scene]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2tLKjeOstg) from spaced    Nope. There are some really good batman comics set in the day, for example, Batman:Zero Year is set entirely on bright summer days.   Try the 'RSS radio' app, it has almost every podcast on there.      It goes deeper than that. It's implied Gwyndolin is actually the puppet of an even *Shadowier* puppeteer who doesn't even appear in the game, Velka, whose essentially playing both sides the whole time.   Yeah, It's an argument that doesn't really apply to voice acting, where  it's extremely unlikely the person doing the voice is a representation of the character, I mean, Tara Strong is partly known for voicing ten year old boys.   Eh, the fact is, It ended with Superman incapacitated and Batman still walking around. As far as I'm aware, that's pretty much the only time batman has been able to do that.   It comes down to a number of different reasons, appealing to audiences, creating characters the execs want, that the creator thinks are interesting ect. You'll have to look at individual games for explanations as to why.   I kind of have a feeling part of the reason Snyder wrote Endgame was so that there was a batman vs superman fight where Superman definitively lost.   Darren Aronofsky and Christopher Nolan will take ideas from that series for years to come...   Is Wonder Womans outfit that absurd? All iterations are pretty toned down from a traditional depiction of Amazons, it doesn't reveal a huge amount of skin, and isn't really impractical. It's quite Conservative considering WW was created by a BDSM loving, Lie detector inventing,polygamist   Do you have the moderator powers to make this happen? I might try and hold you to this in a few months [This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9kVh5U1dPc) doesn't seem impossible to replicate.  Ground zeroes also isn't just one mission. It's eight, it takes about 6-8 hours to play through them all.   And Bloodborne can be beaten in 36 minutes without glitches.   Bloodborne can be beaten in 36 minutes.   Huh, I thought the missing link was the best part of Human revolution.   They let people fund the Justice League, which is way more powerful. Basically, in a world with Thousands of Godlike beings, it's not a big issue if one guy funds 50 Batman esque peak human vigilantes all around the world.   There's quite a bit of *Implied* gay couples in Fire emblem games, so for example Kjelle and Severa get a lot of fanservice sexual tension, but they couldn't have an S support or anything, although if I remember correctly there were also a few ending that had characters become 'true' companions *wink wink* etc.   We do know the rules actually, they're easy to find online.   "Gee, this soccer game is so boring, why doesn't anyone just do the strategical thing and carry the ball over the goal line?"      To be fair, the same team made Razor, which was [unspeakably badass](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZIVhUA-te8) presumably, they just used the old robot they had for the US series from way back in its original incarnation.   Hey, It's my stomping ground! The site comments generally go a bit downhill during E3, a lot of people who don't regularly visit go on the site to whine about how positively star wars battlefront is being received and the like.   SO you haven't played peace walker then? Because the Ai in this is way smarter than that game.   I can't believe this is below 'some presenter were awkward once'. This is the cream of the crop of bad.   That wasn't at E3 though, that was a few months before.   Holy shit, the voice in the trailer is [ZEEEEERRRRRRROOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!](/spoiler)   MONOOOOOORRRRRRAAAAAAAAAIIIIIIIILLLLLLLL!!!!!!!!!!   That's actually just Reggies' regular summer vacation though.   I'll drink to that.   I'm not saying that he's Batman, I'm just saying that he's an extremely similar character in appearance and setup.   But none of the technicalities you listed stophim from being like batman. He still had a sidekick, is still a detective, (literally the first issue of his new series is about detective work) still uses gadgets, still uses batarangs, still had a batmobile and batcopter, still fights crime in a costume that looks like batmans, still glides around like batman, (and one of the most iconic elements of batmans character is that he glides around) has an insignia costume etc. The stuff about Khonshu is debatable, too, as it's constantly questioned whether Khonshu exists. For a reader that hasn't heard of him, the closest approximation to Moon Knight that they'll have heard of is undoubtedly Batman. Same goes for a lot of other peak humans in the Marvel universe, Like Daredevil and Black Panther, even though they have far fewer similarities to batman than Moon Knight.   Fights crime at night, are detectives, have a selection of gadgets, including a car and a plane, took sidekicks at one point, glide on cape, have costumes that resemble the objects/creatures in their name, are unpowered heroes in a world full of powered heroes, use boomerang style throwing weapons, have the insignia of the things in their name on their fronts, are both rich, both had a metaphorical 'death' and 'rebirth' etc. They're extremely similar characters, it's just Moon Knight is less competent and more scrappy, which is a good thing.   Taskmaster talks a big talk, but he's a C-tier villain and he knows it. Part of the fun in his appearances is that you genuinely root for the guy not to get his ass kicked, particularly in Civil War when he accidentally shot Mr fantastic.    Moon Knight is basically like crap batman, but in a good way. He's a millionaire rather than billionaire, a good, but not great, fighter, and a pretty good detective. None of the avengers know or care who he is, he's going crazy, he may be possessed by a medium tier God, but damnit if he won't stand up for what's right!   Battlebots seems to be way lower budget in general than robot wars, so don't expect anything too fancy.   Because that wouldn't have gotten the attention, wouldn't have been upvoted, and then another thread called exactly the same thing as this one would have been voted up. To be fair, I didn't put that Platinum games is expected to be working on it in the title, either.      Isn't the hat just a regular church hunter hat?   I'm probably gonna give it a watch someday, as it sound like the writing sounds pretty top notch, and the animation is likely fantastic. What will make it a priority on my Watchlist is whether it follows through on the whole Yuri thing, as a follow through would make it pretty unique in my eyes.   Man, I don't even watch this show and *I'm* getting caught up in the drama. It'll be real heart in mouth stuff.   Pfft, giving Lewis and Sjin best action shot? Did the judges not see that sweet hairdo in Sips' shot?   Platinum boy strikes again.   Maybe he's only read one comic?   Reynolds!Deadpool isn't part of the Marvel 'multiverse' because he's owned by Fox.   Yep, you pretty much got it.   What Baffles me is that people think *comic books* won't maintain the Status Quo. Like the people who seriously thought the **permanently** killed Peter Parker. It just seems bizarre to me.   Nope, literally every multiverse version of deadpool is dead. He didn't get a good track record in Elseworld stuff before, and then one deadpool went around killing all the other deadpools.   I do think it's just a way to make a fan theory connecting souls and Bloodborne together. You can make a much better case for a 'Joint universe' in Bloodborne than you could in the other souls games.   This. People don't seem to understand that funding arts and culture that tens of millions of people enjoy without any input from marketers and executives might possibly be a **good** thing.   The obvious one is that the background to the Hunters Dream is full of Arch trees, Yarnham is extremely similar to how 'carim' is characterized in the souls series, and the fluted armor can be seen in deep chalice dungeons.   [I'm a big fan of IAMTHEKIDYOUKNOWWHATIMEAN's track from Hotline Miami, Run](https://iamthekidyouknowwhatimean.bandcamp.com/)   Glad to see more people are being turned onto this show after Kung Fury and the like. I'm surprised it doesn't have more of a cult following, really.   Tis' from the guide.   Hey guys... I know this may be controversial and stuff, but I didn't like the dark knight rises... CRUCIFY ME!!!!   Ah, forgot about Micolash. Sorry about that. Did you know some people say Kosm, rather than Kos?   Aw, if it's set in Carim it screws up my headcanon that Yarnham is Carim, or at least related to Carim, hence Marvelous Chester.   You only HAD to fight six bosses in Bloodborne, too   Yeah, Batman comics got Kind of Boring after all the Gotham superheroes eradicated all crime forever, due to there being so many of them.   It's almost like they have to make Hyperbolic statements to sell their magazine! Why can't it have "Xbox, and Playstations, biggest stealth game, comparative to other stealth game of the time!" on the cover?   Considering the Preview was done using the PS4 build, and they both come from future press,  I doubt it'll be too different.   Has any MGS game ever used the best box art? I think Konami worries that a handdrawn box art will alienate the bro audience.   Ladies and Gentlemen... prepare yourselves.... for the Magnificent SHOOOOOOOOOOOOJJJJJJIIII TABBBBUUUUUUUUUUCHIIIIIII!!   Nah. I wish it was though.   I'm Looking forward to a new avengers team made up of Moon Knight, Taskmaster, Deadpool, Spidey and Wolverine then ;)   Batman and the Joker obviously aren't dead, though. I suppose the better statement to say is that Harvey Dent will never defeat Two-Face, he'll never be able to stave off the madness for long enough.   Nobody in the marvel universe will ever care about moon knight, the Joker will never kill batman, batman will never kill the Joker, Two Face will never reform, squirrel girl will never be beaten, Thanos will never actually go on a date with death. There are some, you just have to think outside the box!   Batman in general is probably the superhero with the highest proportion of good stuff. Since Tim Burtons batman, he's always been genre defining SOMETHING, Film, comics, games, animation, masses and masses of quality content.   Couple of hours at the most. I'm kind of staggered. There's already another comment on the video from a different guy, too.      PRAISE EBERON! HERO OF THE TWENTY FIRST AGE!   Ubisoft doesn't want to do a Asian assassins creed because they think ninjas are overplayed. (and that a japan AC would make a lot of money on a rainy day)    Basically every Pixar film is essentially the product of months of meddling from the Pixar 'Brain trust' of producers and directors, who make suggestions that completely change the nature of the movie.   You don't like Mr caffeine? What a poop on your toothpaste thing to say.   well, uk ninja warrior doesn't have reality show bits so eh......   Just weigh the negatives up against the positives, and your personal sentiment towards the film. You don't need to have a 'list' to go through, as it's not like you're gonna crack some mathematical formula that makes everyone agree with you. The reason a five star system is used a lot is because it's deliberately vague, and means that the majority of the time you don't have to judge one movie you really liked as objectively better than another movie you really liked.   My advice is to read a lot of criticism to see how they do it. Look at den of geek, or Roger Ebert.com or Total Film, or listen to Mark Kermode and see how they appraise things.   Animation is usually conceptualized at the storyboard stage, which is where the majority of the camera movements will be visualized for the artists to work on. The director an cinematographer should be on hand at every stage of animation (3D animations in particular goes through 4-5 different 'builds' of the film) to make sure this vision gets translated to the final product. Interestingly, Mad max: Fury road was also essentially made from a 'script' of 2700 storyboards. Claymation will either us a mix of these techniques or be shot traditionally, just on a smaller scale   I'd love to see sips give bloodborne a shot.   The new secret six book essentially has catman as the main character.   Aim to keep as little distance as possible between your finger and the button between each tap, rather than simply trying to brute force your way through using regular taps like in the rest of the game.   I don't buy it. That trait is already possessed by a number of supervillians and heroes in the DC universe. If the Joker was one of them, it would be brought up in one of the events that features metafictional themes.   Wait, when has this been brought up? Isn't hypersanity a trait possessed only by psycho pirate and animal man? Isn't hypersanity extremely valuable for building reality warper machines in the DC universe?    Well established *in what?*   Chris Kamara's relentless enthusiasm sure is infectious.   It's kind of satisfying seeing more people given the opportunity to fail though. Seeing 250 people get whittled down to 0 over 8 hours is pretty exhilarating.    Perhaps his role will be expanded upon in DLC? or perhaps he'll be a character similar to the asylum crow in Darksouls: and entity whose intentions never become entirely clear.   Yeah, that **WAS** an odd episode of psycho pass.   So in the final of UK ninja warrior it essentially turned into an exact replica of the Japanese show and it's pretty glorious, with the 2nd round remaining unbeaten by a single second. The sheer arsehurt on twitter could power a thousand suns.   Yeah, whilst I accept the idea of the two works taking elements from each other, I can't deny I get a little annoyed when people proclaim Kung Fury the best thing ever despite the fact Danger 5 has *three hours* of this material and is nowhere near as popular.   It's surreal humor that isn't particularly '80's' too. It's not like there was a popular show in the 80's that had someone be shot through a telephone and had animals represented by humans with animal heads.   Each to their own. I think Danger 5, to me, has considerably more likable characters and more grounded action. But that's just me.   Danger 5 manages to cope with it pretty well. It's basically this premise made into six half hour episodes (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYXHzOqnMpk)   Have to say, having just watched Danger 5 season 2, the similarities are really distracting, right down to shooting people through a telephone, dinosaur headed men in a police station, going back in time to kill Hitler... [For context this is danger 5](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYXHzOqnMpk)   To be fair [McIntosh's criticism wasn't exactly endearing to other critics, either] ( https://twitter.com/tonyszhou/status/601144102755835904)   Why are GG guys so annoyed with a Tory Government that is all about protecting the rights of the rich anyway? Because of all the spying/surveillance/stripping of civil rights?   Yeah, but Batman has always looked like an irresponsible lunatic (fights crime with children/teens) when you put that much thought into him, and it's not like that's gonna particularly affect his standing with the Justice League or anything.     	109
 Almost unrecognizable.   Once (2007)   You've probably heard of Inception You might have heard of Super 8 You probably haven't heard of The war game You've never heard of The Face of Another   Really great post. Thanks for the explanation man.   This is probably going to be the best movie of the year.   Amazing.   Heaven knows what he is gonna do..    Hell yeah!!      It will surely gross more than 1 billion dollars.  	10
  How will things will go on as they always have, if he is unbeholden to anyone?

Like this one too, but it gives me a chuckle when I hear it in my 21 year old Buick, that was built 13 years after this song came out.    Obviously it time to eliminate freedom of the press if it's going to get in the way of electing the most popular candidate.     I doubt Hitler could have been a comedian, he really seem to lack a sense of humour.      Compared to this summer in Alabama it looks like Heaven.    Seems Irish too me.         Jade Helm 16?   You have to have a left handed awl to do that.   Actually the prospective Groom believes that's why it was denied. He thinks the Judge thought that he and both Brides would all be marriage to each other.        And the people my family owned? should I reach out my hand to the hand of people that I might still own to this day if not for Sherman?   At some point you'd think they'd realize that whether they like it or not, the South isn't going to rise again and start living for today.      I am a white southerner and I still don't understand it. I also don't run around waving a Celtic Flag at Italians because the Roman Empire invaded the British Isles 2,000 years ago either.         Hillary Clinton is a Corvair?   Without comparison, all Presidents are shitty aren't they?   More popular than Pao?   Wasn't Trump in a Frat House paddling pledges when that happened?   In a letter to the Saxon Chancellor Gregor Brck, Martin Luther stated that he could not "forbid a person to marry several wives, for it does not contradict Scripture."   Yes. give the keys to your house to someone who is sure that they will not be taken up to heaven.   How has Nancy Grace not made the connection?!    I expected Brazzers.   Like the Japanese in California in the Forties?    She Jewish and doesn't want you to think he did this because he's Muslim?    Having citizenship make you a slave?   Common, as in you a common sumbitch!    So it's more important to comb over details and propaganda from something that's over and done with than something that's is or isn't happening now?    So, who won the last Goldman Sachs Primary? Was it Romney? how about the one before that?      So, the most pro business POTUS ever?   So Trump gets to wear a Trump logo?   Put some mustard on 'em.

What an amazing coincidences, on the same day that Hillary Clinton proposes tax breaks for corporate profit-sharing, you suggest Reddit give users a share in profits.      This wasn't random.   So does The LA Times not consider itself to be part of the National media?        Were they simply celebrating there heritage as a part of the Confederacy? in spite of never having been in the Confederacy?    Tomorrow on Limbaugh:  "Why do I have to pay for deadbeats in the projects to be able to watch Pornhub in Hid-Def?"     Really? Because from what I'm hearing on reddit, she so worried about Sanders that she doesn't think she'll even be running against Jeb.   The problem with that line of thinking is that not all fringe/3rd parties are the same and one could still be the greater of three evils.   So did mine, until she took that online quiz that told her she actually was a closer match with Sanders.      Yes I would. I haven't voted for anyone for President that I passionately supported in my life, It has always been the lesser of two evils.                         Bobby "The Brain" Heenan came back as a dog.    it isn't the comments. If you were Pepsi or Sears, would you want your banner ad to show up in r/coontown?      Is it 2am already?   What? No John Boy!  Whatever, I was watching Flip Wilson anyway.      Hispanics are a huge demographic, doesn't seem to concern trump?         Is this how we're monetizing Reddit?    I think I met this guy once, he was standing in front of a statue of Talos in Whiterun.   Yes it has Jim, which is why you won't be nominated.   A bar is a Public place and you can be arrested for being drunk in any public place.   Dell Publishing has been around since 1921 and has nothing whatsoever to do with the computing company founded in 1984.    Highlander, there should have been only one.   So in your opinion Reagan was pro-labor?    I find hard to imagine Hillary being concerned about her lack of appeal to a group that has mostly voted republican since 1968 and was never going to support her in first place.        Are you suggesting that all sixty year olds should always and forever be judged by the political views that they held while in college?    And is then killed by another citizen.   More like "I'll build a Wall between Texas and Mexico and I'll make Mexico pay for it and make them tell me thank you for making us do it."   I Honestly haven't decided, I have just recently decided to support my Mayor in his bid for reelection and still don't know who I will vote for in the city council race.

Wouldn't be able to point to the 'Pao is a CUNT' posts, if there hadn't been any, no one can be made to look like an ass without cooperation.    160 million regular users  so how many signatures did that petition have? like a quarter million?    At this point it's probably because their well has run dry and has nothing to do with taxes or economic opportunities.     You the real MVP.

Domestic wars are worse.                     I once had a guy I worked with who told me that every morning would open his Bible to a random page and read a random passage and that this would allow God to speak to him.               Ho-yo-ho!   Ever hear of veal? not all cattle are raised.   But her parents have a traditional marriage with one man and one woman, thank god!   And this stopped them from reporting what?   Budget cuts or tax increases now would help avert that scary scenario  Why not both?   That's one helluva random start.      Where and when did I make an accusation of racism? Considering that both Lewinsky and Bundy as well as Clinton and Paul are white, I fail to see how any of this could be misconstrued to be about race?    The Greek bailout referendum   But who would benefit most from Reddit collapsing? Who most fears Reddit?      Watched it, still didn't see any proof that anyone one there was pregant or had cancer.    Trump is just mad that this guy is no longer available to make his suits that he was selling at Macy's anymore.    and of course you have video of that happening and proof that the daughter was pregnant and proof that the mother had cancer, right?      Did Monica Lewinsky pull her guns on Federal agents?       The actor playing "Clint" would go on to play a major role in a much more famous OTR program in the 50's and then a supporting role in an iconic 1960's T.V. sitcom.      You don't have to say there Jim, just go home and take Bieber with you.   Has anybody actually called the time and temperature since 1986?      Article I, Section 8, Clause 1 of the United States Constitution, grants the federal government of the United States its power of taxation. While authorizing Congress to levy taxes, this clause permits the levying of taxes for two purposes only: to pay the debts of the United States, and to provide for the common defense and general welfare of the United States.   The only way a tax could be illegal would be if it was levied for some purpose other than to pay the debts of the U.S., or to provide for the common defense and general welfare of the U.S.               The stakes are too high and the issue too important to simply cede the will of the people to five unaccountable justices. - Rick Santorum   You sound like Archie Bunker.   51% of Americans believe storms affect cloud computing.

Not only aren't you in jail, you are still in the country and talking to the national media. God Bless America!   We can't be opposed to his policies without being called racist?    Man, you sure know a lot about black folks don'tcha? You must spend a lot of time reading about them, thinking about them?    But not all Democrats are Sanders supporters yet.      And then it pointed at a Unicorn and then the Empire's new clothes.      How can a corporation make money, if it's customer base has been culled by a civil war? How would a plantation owner make money by tricking half their slaves into killing the other half?   The photograph displayed is not of a former CIA agent named "Normand Hodges," but rather a picture swiped from a 2014 article published by the Guardian about the practice of chaining gravely ill prisoners in the hospital.

Wow, not even remotely the article headline. Also adding the word gun for no apparent reason.      Meh, got toilet paper.       There's nothing in these video that indicates what this man's occupation is.         The only thing that it has accomplished so far is getting the Confederate Flag removed from the SC Capital.   You working on the assumption that 100% of Blacks are registered to vote and do?   Have any proof that any of them every vote for anyone? Or does this just feel truthy to you?  	202
 For context we are both in our mid-twenties. I am coming to you guys for insight in depression in relationships, where /r/relationships would just tell me to leave her and move on.  So the skinny is I met this girl 5 months ago and we instantly hit it off. Same interests, same intelligence, same humor, same sex drive, we could talk at length about anything. She told me from the beginning I met her in a dark place due to life events and a break up that really hurt her a month before I met her. She has a family history of depression (sister, mom) but has never herself been diagnosed. In the last month she has acted really distant, making snide comments, not responding to my messages, and being overall cold which is not her style. Her affect was flat, she was sleeping 10-11 hours a day and was crying quite a bit. I tried to support her through this all.  Last week she told me the relationship was stressing her out and she needed time to process things from when before we met. She said she has never had a guy like me, and really hates to lose me. She said at some point she may be able to make something work but I shouldn't count on it. I want to be there and support her through this and still be her friend. I want that because I want to keep the hopes alive of having something in the future, and because she wants me to be her friend. What do you guys think about all of this?  Tl;DR - lady friend with possible depression ended things to deal with emotions. I still want to support her and be around her with the hopes of dating in the future. What should I do?   As someone who has never seen the show, I'm trying to find the humor in slapping a child and threatening his family. If someone can explain context I would be grateful.   Well, I guess it is time. Hello gray friend!   Thank you very much for your input. I am just beginning my project so I am just trying to collect some raw data at this point. Later on down the road would you and some of your classmates be willing to fill out a questionnaire at some point? It probably wouldn't be for awhile.  I think the key for both fields to work together is to find common ground and to learn more about the other field. I think too often naturopaths are labeled as not using evidence and allopaths are labeled as pill pushers too busy for their patients. Common ground is easy, we both want what is best for patients. As for the later, what is a good resource for learning about evidence of naturopathy? I have read a little bit on UpToDate and we did have a lecture about natural remedies in my pharmacology class.     *Edit*: Do you know of other good forums/resources where I could talk with other naturopaths and patients?   Thank you for your input!  *Edit*: Do you know of other good forums/resources where I could talk with other naturopaths and patients?   Basically I see this movement as a symptom of problems in the allopathic system (too much drug emphasis? Not enough time spent with patients?).  I am looking to talk to providers and patients a like. If any of you have opinions or connections I would love to hear them.   Melee lags when played in an HD TV. Hopefully you still have a cathode laying around still.   More than likely not. There would be a lot more blood because the explosion would have to go through a lot of body parts and vessels which all would have been pushed into the air. Plus there is a lot of connective tissue around the intestines so they would look clumpier.   Source: have dissected people   /r/oddlysatisfying  	9

 Benghazi is like a religion to some people.  I mean ... is it all they have to keep them going?   They might like it even more in /r/scifi, because this feels like something out of one of those old DAW yellow-spined novels from the '70s.  Which were awesome.   I feel pleased to have at least a few books published in the 1880s   1890s,* and a whole lot more from the next few decades, but I'm interested in how common it is to have *really* old books.   *"Ganot's Physics," 1886, and "Aspects of the Earth," 1889, both of which have wonderful illustrations.   The color range feels like exactly the reverse of what it should be.   Her comment about Ambrose beating his whores, when explaining her motivation for helping Kvothe steal back Denna's ring.  It was obviously based on personal experience.  That, and other subtle clues that she very frequently entertained males guests of, shall we say, brief acquaintance.  She also offers to sleep with Kvothe in exchange for getting into the archive, like it was a usual business tactic of hers.  EDIT: And there seems to be a bit of downvote brigading going on, for no reason.  Anyone else notice this?   In case it wasn't obvious, she also makes money as an escort/prostitute.  That may be how she set herself up so fast.    Does anybody know another source for that than this book,  William Manchester mentions it in *The Arms of Krupp*.    You've become everything you ever hated.  You either die a fabled Chinese warrior-woman disguised as a man, or live long enough to become a buttered popcorn jellybean.   Right, no answer.    even when the damage is as plain as noses on faces  If it's so plain, why don't you say what it is, instead of repeating Teabagger whargarrble.    If I could babysit kids for 8 hours every day, have summers off, and make as much money as someone who studied 8 torturous years in college  ... you wouldn't be a public school teacher, because that doesn't describe their life *at all*.    are teachers saying they'd teach better if they were paid more?  No, but a higher quality of teacher could be brought into the field to start with if they could actually make a living that way.  A lot of well-qualified people stay away from public school teaching due to low pay.    Why can't it be SHARED? Why do the people who have been there since the Bronze age (Jews) have to leave?  The Palestinians are the ones currently being kicked out of their homes.  No amount of literally ancient history can justify that.    If Iran gets a nuclear bomb, it will balance out the power between Israel and Iran right now.  Not particularly.  Even when Israel faced an existential threat in '67 and '73, they didn't use nukes.  They didn't use them against Iraq in the '80s.  Why expect a nation like Iran to behave any less rationally?  They don't have any use for nuclear weapons beyond pure deterrence, same as Israel, India, and Pakistan.    The deal won't work and Iran will continue to develop nuclear weapons.  Do you also have tonight's lottery numbers?   Jews have been in the West Bank since before the 4th Century BC.  So have a lot of other people, who went on to continue living there until before the Balfour Agreement.   But they shouldn't even be there right? Wipe them out. Destroy all traces.   Hey look, it's that thing I didn't say.  So weird that 2000 years of history is dismissed  Yes, it is weird that you're ignoring almost 2000 years of the Palestine region having a very small, non-sovereign Jewish population, while being heavily inhabited by Arabs, some of whom still live there and would like to keep the land they're currently living on.   Israel only acquired physical authority over the West Bank in 1967.  And ... did you just say that the West Bank belongs to the PLO because King Hussein gave it to them?  That's sort of an admission of Palestinian ownership.   "Very, very distant ancestors of ours lived here 1900 years ago" isn't a real strong claim to land.  As recently as 1905, Jews made up less than 5% of the population of what was then called Palestine (and has been called Palestine since Roman times).    The Stimulus was supposed to create tons of jobs  It did.    ... in order to defend themselves from the results of our presidents actions/inactions.  The result of those actions being ... Iran not building a nuclear bomb.  But I guess Israel needs to defend themselves from ... that?   Same here.   Thank God no other major global religions have institutionalized problems with child sex abuse.    Why do we invite these people in?  We're on pretty good terms with Kuwait.  Why must be punish ourselves like this?  Like what?  The last mass shooting was a racist white redneck from the heart of Real America.   And that's probably the primary reason he didn't get a deserved Medal of Honor.    This deal reminds me of Neville Chamberlain coming back from Munich   I'm sure it only does so because you're ignorant of what happened in either Munich or the current deal with Iran.     and /r/mealprepsunday  This is the sub I've been looking for without knowing I was looking for it.  Thank you.   I bet they didn't.   It was done, yes,   Complete retard in two posts.    I bet they didn't.  Except for the part where, you know, they admitted to having done so.  Which you would know if you'd read the fucking article.    okay an explanation, it's like if pokemon could digivolve. So Charizard gets a battle only transformation to a stronger form  None of that made any sense to me.    I was a teenager when you were born. Feel better?  I was a teenager when you were a teenager when /u/lurknomoretoday was born.  I don't feel better.   All I can think is that if my parents had caught me doing any of that stuff, they'd have cracked open a beer and egged me on.    for what it's worth he's won more playoff games than Andy Dalton.  That's actually not worth very much.    We have cut down on the partying a long time ago.  Well, yeah, the school year's been over for like a month now.    NFC west doesn't have any RBs with QB like qualities  I was going to ask about Michael Robinson, but checked and saw that he retired.    Never seen snow in my life.  ... that's just really strange to me.    QBs throwing 100 mph etc...  Now if only Kaepernick *wasn't* able to do that - and apparently nothing else, it might actually be an improvement.    Homie don't play that.  And then you'll have to explain where "homie don't play that" came from, who Fire Marshall Bill was, and what a Fly Girl is.   Water - not even once.    A drone is the size of a bird, are you telling me a bird could down a helicopter?  Yes, actually one could.  Birds are also a flight hazard to helos and larger aircraft.  And drones are made of metal and plastic, which are more of a threat to cause potentially fatal damage.   I'm looking to do a badhistory write up of parts of "A People's History of the United States," and I don't even know where to begin.   Are you saying it's not true that several countries with extremely strict gun laws don't not lead the world in homicides, but in fact just the opposite?    If the murders just switched to knifes  If, if, if.  Hey, let's look at what *what is actually the case.*     And if my aunt had balls she'd be my uncle.  But hey, let's talk about what's *actually true*.    America has a much higher population,  That's not how rates work.    There is no gun problem.  Then, clearly, no one needs to own one.   Do you know how statistics work?    Also we should be looking at homicide rates, not gun homicide rates  Yeah, because that makes sense, when talking about gun laws.  Hey, let's talk about other, non-related stuff!  because the point of gun laws is to reduce the overall homicide rate, not just a particular type of homicide.  That's the opposite of reality.  That's like saying seat-belt laws are intended to reduce the overall mortality rate, rather than the car-crash fatality rate.  Because that's pretty fucking stupid.    If I were to deny the existence of any country, it might be Liberia, just based on pure, unadulturated unusualness.  I'm still kind of suspicious about Moldova, myself.    Also, why is Liberia in quotes. Do they not acknowledge its existance,   Reddit has actual, non-trolling Flat Earthers.  Are you surprised at the possibility of Liberia-Truthers?  Because like denying Finland exists, I wouldn't be surprised that it's a thing.     Mexico is "gun free"  No ... no, it isn't.     The cited gun homicide rate is per 100,000 people.  Per capita renders raw population numbers irrelevant.    U.S. also has a higher population then Australia almost 400 million compared to almost 30  Completely irrelevant when talking about per capita rates.  Australia is also an island with next to zero illegal immigration and non pores border.  That's hilarious.  You are aware that illegal immigration is a pretty big issue in Australia?   And what does illegal immigration have to do with gun crime?   Key line:  The  US now has a gun homicide rate 370 times that of Australia's,  Mr Chapman writes.  I'd love to hear the NRA explain how this is *bad*.   I'd be more inclined to give some of you people rides if you used the shower that's, like, thirty feet behind you.   Chester, in front of the laundromat.  I was doing some laundry while he was out there.   That's not very fun.   And yet the biggest tits still belong to the dudes.  I mean, I'm not saying that's sad, but ... that's pretty sad.       Worls War 2 was only 30 some years before the 70s   ... yep, the math checks out.    I have 13 dollars in my bank account, but you don't hear me bragging about it.  No, that's more of a humble-brag, Mr. I-Can-Afford-Real-Soup-Instead-of-Top-Ramen-Or-Maruchan.  Way to drop those digits just oh-so casually.    Mushy and pretty flavorless.  I've heard testicles described this way before, usually by ex-girfriends.   No, he's just an attention-seeking douche.   I guessed New Mexico.  Only off by 10,000 miles, but that's better than usual for me.   That's definitely in "report to the police" territory, right there.  Call up the Sheriff's Dept.   Shots retired.   Ahh, beforeitsnews.com  For people who don't trust the sell-out, mainstream corporatism of zerohedge.com.   There's plenty of speculation.    Why the fuck don't they reverse the trades?  Because it was a stupid part of the plot as a result of the writers thinking they were far more clever than they really are.   You mean Seahawks legend Warren Moon?   True discipline is only reading each leaf of the Far Side calender on its given day.   This doesn't explain the modern-day Kote/Kvothe, that Bast, Chronicler, and everyone everywhere knows about, and is still alive.   We also don't have 20,000 miles of arctic coastline including a few major ports, so ... we don't need to be.   As soon as we can expect you to make an intelligent post.    By freeing slaves, Lincoln recognized it as sovereign.  That is completely and utterly wrong.  The Emancipation Proclamation specifically was based on the understanding that he had the power to free the slaves in rebelling territories, in his role as Commander-In-Chief.    AND BREAKFAST.  AND LUNCH.  AND SNACKS.    HOLY SHIT 78%   Only one other person on the list just barely cracks 70%. That, and the 13.3% TD percentage - 11 out of 83 passes were TDs.     Yeah it does - it tastes like sugar.   That somewhere is reddit.   They could point out certain specific astronomical or geological events in advance.  Earthquakes, hurricanes, specific cloud-patterns on the gas planets, etc.   There are still plenty of great opportunities for when someone asks you if they could buy a Vowell.     Bananas and lemons.    Cut away view shows the inside of the ship.  ... which is exactly what this image does.  What exactly do you think is going on?  You realize you can't actually see the aircraft below deck from the sides, right?  Or see them with their wings folded lined up in rows in the hangar?    placing unrealistic sanctions on Japan  The sanctions were a direct response to a war of aggression being waged by Japan.  They were not an attempt to cause a war, they were a response to a war *already being fought*.   That's not a cutaway.  ...   Instead of downvoting me for being correct,  You are incorrect.  It *is* a cutaway.   So ... you'd like to go back to some imaginary time?  Well, have fun with that.  Dropping some acid might help.    Obama says the border is secure!  Don't you wish we could go back to the good old days, before Obama was President and there were no illegal immigrants? You know, that time that *never fucking existed*.     Plant it.  I did that a month ago, and it's growing fine.   Just dump a bunch of them into some vodka and wait a few days.   Way ahead of you on that.   And?  You say that like it's a problem.    To be fair, ice cream with salt or pepper would be equally as shitty.  I, uh, don't think you understand how ice cream is traditionally made.      unless Kaepernick manages 400 yards rushing   Well, I mean ... it's not impossible.    How come there is never any official response via Reddit admins/staff during huge events like this?  Because there's never been any consequences for ignoring us.   And here I thought Big Ben was such a nice guy.   "Anyone not wearing 2,000,000 sunblock is about about to have a really bad day."     /r/pics just went down. It's the biggest sub on the site.  Between that and /r/AskReddit, reddit just shot itself in the foot big-time, revenue wise.  Never mind the pure bad PR.    You will survive a day or two without Reddit.  You can't prove that.   I'm kind of shocked that someone as classy as /u/Up-The-Butt_Jesus is an /r/watchpeopledie subscriber.    The capitalist system we live in necessitates such actions.  OK, now I just wonder if /r/Communism is going private, as a way of protesting by depriving reddit of a small amount of ad-based revenue.    I'll have to like....go outside or some shit  Why would you do that?  /r/outside isn't even a very active sub.    It shows that AskReddit alone has paid for over 30 years of server time. This is not an error.  Oh, there's an error all right.  And this chart sums up what it is.   I really kind of wonder just how important gilding in major subs is, financially.  Ad revenue is probably a lot higher, even on an individual client basis.  Of course, that's gonna get fucked, too.   Sleat semi-confirms the Ambrose connection; and the Horse and Four was confirmed by Anker.  Also, he was *definitely* committing malfeasance against Kvothe, and Devi didn't sound like she was making up the "he beats his whores" line.   It's like they don't understand America.   Chester here, 98.  Which isn't right man, it's just not right.   Anton Antonov-Ovseyenko, then.   It's because the people that vote for him typically have the IQ of an unplugged refrigerator.     It's almost feels like Texas has a different "Southern" identity than "Southern" people living in MS, AL, GA, etc.   I think it's also because only a few minor campaigns were fought on Texan soil - the state was cut off pretty early by the Union securing the Mississippi.  So there's no "battlefield memorial every time you turn around" feel.   Instructions unclear, now captain of a starship.   Feel free to send me your copy.   They would be drunk and snorting coke off a hooker's ass, most likely.   I thought Crowe worked out all right as Jack.  But I also spent the whole movie thinking that the actor playing Stephen was Jude Law, so I might not be the best judge of such things.     A hat was nearly as mandatory as pants or a skirt.  Since when are pants mandatory?   It's a lot easier just to ask which non-slave-owning states were a part of the Confederacy, and which slave-owning states were part of the Union.  It's not a coincidence that the answer to both is "none."   Hey, tone down the language a bit.  No need to be so insulting.   They also had him for some reason destroying a door.  Sounds familiar.  www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhroluJ2IPE  	116
 Flask with Hibiki 12 y.o.      Mad Men. The last episode was so lame.     Me: Hi there. How can I hel-  Him: Stop talking! I love your hair!  Me: Ok you just insulted me on four levels. Take a seat so I can take you through each of them, in depth, while I make your cocktail.    Hahaha I live in Brisbane.    Pronounce the T in 'often'.    Dad?   Do you want sweet, sour, bitter, fruity, savory? Do you have a preference on base spirit?   If nothing comes from that then classic daiquiri or southside.     Heh bar comp parties are loose as hell and one of the reasons I do this competitively. I just submitted my drink for diagio aus round two. I'm just surprised that most of what I see on this sub tends to be beginners or a little pub/speed bar focused, not that much emphasis on cocktails. Am I on the wrong sub?   I haven't seen much on /r/bartenders about the competitive cocktail world. So just putting it out there. I'll post my drinks if you want and we can chat. I'd be interested to hear how these competitions work in other countries.   One of my best girlfriends at a party. We were gonna smoke some bongs so the host stands up and says "I'll go get the coffee grinder." And this girls looks up and says "Oh are we going to have, like, weed and espresso?".    Out Cold   Condom/tampon pack.     Im 24, female, Brisbane Aus. Just finished a 10 hour bartending shift (we got fisted, its saturday night here). Im sipping a stone and wood lager knock off. We're going out because its my coworkers last night and tomorrow I'm going to a birthday party. Im looking forward to havong a shot of rum when we get to the next bar.    Hey, watch this!   Also Holgate Mellenium Falcon   Holgate Temptress Chocolate Porter. Aussie beer.    If you like Mumford and Sons I reccomend Frightened Rabbit      We've already fuckin got one, mate.    This is hypnotic and really soothes the OCD.   How did you know that was me?  	22
 So in the store you will notice TV's playing stupid commercials about products they carry. These have been around for awhile, but recently they installed newer monitors that have what appear to be webcams at the top of the screen. I'm assuming they're for facial recognition software, but I just though I'd let you all become aware of this latest installation.    Took 3.5 years to buy a decent camera   My last girlfriend said she got gifted multiple games on Steam from random guys she's never met. I really don't see the point as the guy   I'd say the best advice is to look at the pre-reqs you need on your own and make your own schedule. That way you can just show it to your advisor and they can change it as needed   Right? I love the book The Outsiders and they're smoking at the age of 9. Let's bring those cigarettes back   Almost forgot which subreddit I was in for a second   But he spent millions on it and he has computer coders living in it in pimped out Airstreams. Not you know, white trash   West Coaster here, was very confused by the logo. Still confused by the different names   I've never seen a cat jump like that, then it gets flung back like a ragdoll     When and why did they stop making things awesome looking?   Robin wouldn't have gotten so jealous, Ted probably would have obsessively gone after Robin, Ted and Robin probably  would not have gotten together   NPR is the one page on FB that I actually enjoy in my newsfeed   Myspace was fun because nobodies parents were on it   I remember last time this gif was posted I think to /funny. Everyone was up in arms about how badly the dude got hurt, I never realized redditors were that anti-prank. The dude didn't need to chase after him at all   That first one is pretty funny. Just last night I was watching one of the first ones where Ted and Robin are dating and she calls him Teddy bear even though she hates nicknames   Assuming their eyes work similar to humans that's an incredibly accurate shot considering the effects of the water   And I think it's the 2nd episode ever when he says he was hooking up with a girl in his back seat   There's other cans that say "wingman"   Yeah, just don't make fun of people for things that are out of their control   That final goodbye...   This is why we need a redditor to point out another redditor's username   Where do I sign up for these?   A few more bounces and he'll be getting 1 ups   I had Mario Party calluses on my thumbs   They also make fantastic salsa   I know this was supposed to be epic or whatever, but I was just confused. The Boyz 2 men part at the end was so out of left field and random I couldn't appreciate it at all. It really just made no sense, along with the rest of the episode   Soo like how ELI5 is actually supposed to be?   At least you can only vote once unless... well you know      I'm still friends and roommates from the people on my floor there. I had a blast there, it's kinda loud but you can work around it. Just keep your door open and you will meet tons of people. Also it's close to the science buildings, don't know if that helps you or not   That will be a difficult schedule since you will be spending a lot of time in anatomy open lab. If it's only in the fall though and you need it, then you got it   Bosco   I hate the Robin/Loretta plot. Them being mean to each other a day before the wedding is honestly not fun to watch at all   She's hot but Marshal could easily get any girl he wanted   Well she was hardly honest with Marshal about the whole SF thing before she left for it, she never mentioned it to him   They can't see me if I can't see them   This was a good start to the season. Of course, well, nevermind..   And then someone replies with the obligatory other girl subreddit with the super long acronym name   he's saying independently he is going to date who he wants to, but if she doesn't like his friends then that is a problem to him   This episode was 11/10. So perfect. I didn't like a lot of the episodes from this season so when this one happened I watched over and over. It's definitely different from the normal settup but it just shows how deep the show can get. Just Ted alone with his thoughts and I think we've all been there, and the speech of course. One of the best out of the whole series   There's also a time when in like the 2nd episode Barney says he hooked up with a girl in his car even though he doesn't own a car nor can he drive      Or we just make short acceptable to wear as a society? I don't see what's wrong with just khaki shorts that aren't cargo short or anything like that   If you had just deleted everything after the comma it would've been good   I'm not saying it tastes bad but when you have commercials on TV I think you're no longer a craft beer   This was really just a strange episode. I like the Robin Sparkles videos but to have a whole fake documentary on a character was kindof pushing it big time. It's awesome they got all those cameos but it also felt like a bit of a waste of their talent to say one line. Just more weird attributes to Robin's character  Also why would they ruin the whole Marshal Lily story like that? For the sole reason of justifying what Ted is doing by being a stalker? Had they seriously ran out of that many ideas at that point? Seemed totally unnecessary to make Ted feel better   Had to look it up and learned he's 31 years old. Did not expect that   I don't know boxing but I keep hearing Manny is past his prime, but Floyd is older than him. So what makes one more out of their prime than the other?   If these are clean is there an NSFW version?   *raises spork*   Definitely scales especially with bass guitar. Learn scales, then chords, and chord progressions.   And do practice consistently but don't burn yourself out on it, just be patient   Ha the comments "this is turning into Digg" and "this is looking more like metafilter"  Complaining about Reddit's downfall was there from the start   Definitely grades. And Finals schedule   A game of world domination played by two guys who can barely control their own lives   This has been brought up recently on here but seriously why did Barney propose on Ted's big architecture night? Yes he wants Ted's blessing but it didn't need to happen then. Plus Marshal and Lily barely showed up. I think that really piled on for Ted, the fact that his friend's got engaged and no one even showed up for him. Poor chap   He just said studying in the tub. The other 85 minutes are spent soaking   You've been on a roll the last couple days, glad to see you active on here   Pretty sure that guy was joking. At least I hope he was   We should get an AMA from one of the players at this game   I have no doubts there are more men than women on online dating, although there are a lot of women. But comparing it to the real world is fairly similar, there's almost always more guys than girls at every party/bar you go to.  Just gotta do what you can   This episode was actually pretty funny with all their different stories in Barney's apartment. I love at the end when Patrice asks what Lily and Ted are doing there and Barney says he doesn't know his friends are just intrusive lol. The ending made me want to vomit though   It was also one of the first. There was WoW but Runescape was free. The other popular game at the time was Neopets, and I guess club penguins if you were into that   If UW is so damn great then they can apply and go to Seattle. If being in their hometown is their priority then they shouldn't be going to Med school   Also the guy that makes one word follow up posts for tons of karma?    My roommate does this, I have to leave the room everytime he eats anything   They're real, and they're spectacular    Really quite heart-warming. They're mutual teamwork almost makes up for the whole target chinese and arab markets thing   Seriously why is dogfish head so much more expensive? My local bar will have all pints $2 except theirs   How else will the most people get the most karma?   Look up the standup slide distance record. People slide on their knees like 50 feet because they're going so fast   I mean he was actually successful until he decided to just cut into the guy   How do they not clean up anything before they leave? The spilled food stuff everywhere is really gross   Just like anything it just takes some "practice" and getting used to.  Next time you're out try talking to a stranger about anything, ask them how their day is going. People are surprisingly nice. Or make it easier on yourself and go to the bar, order a beer and talk to the person next to you. Then work your way up from there, and don't be afraid to speak your mind   Those blood oranges. If you ever have the opportunity to try Elysian superfuzz beer it is quite good   Will Arnett is the perfect "business man" looking man   Qdoba now has free guac and sour cream. $1.25 is just ridiculous for some guacomole when I can buy a whole one for 60 cents   It says Delta Tau Delta on one of the doors   http://imgur.com/2byW1Vc  Don't know where I got this but I've had it forever   Correct me if I'm wrong but those aren't the voice actors, it says they are the inspirations for the character's looks?   My ex loved dirty talk, and I was terrible at it. And she would want me to talk dirty as I was doing stuff to her so I guess like narrating what I was doing at the time? To me it was just weird I guess   Where did he even keep that when he wasn't using it? Do people actually carry these all over?   Pretty douche move by Brad, which is too bad because I always thought he was funny throughout the show even though we don't see much of him.   There must be like, 5 episodes where we see that Ted is apparently the only reason Marshal and Lily are together. And everytime it's used as some justifiable thing for something he does wrong, like with the birthday picture plot earlier in the show with Lily   So why are turtles riding alligators exactly?   I'd say twitter and gplus are fb's nemeses    Dat ass. She's got a shelf on her back                   (               .) )              `(,' (,              ). (, ('             ( ) ; ' )             ')_,_)_(`              [_____]               \_ _/                |_|_           __.-'(__ )            '-. \___ )             _.\_)__ )            _   (__ )        jgs  `'-\_/'   I love the dinosaur utopia that's between the layers   Back when it was just simple and easy looking. Had the categories and way easier to find everything, especially random stuff   What doesn't make sense is when Barney calls out to the taxi cab driver that his gf is a stripper. He is yelling at stairs.   That is some impressive paw strenth   I am also 22. Does that mean I get to date her?   Would that even be illegal? Tons of bars and restaurants have the same name throughout different cities   Welcome to Sports Center   For instance the wheel, calculus, logic, etc.      Everyone in here debating rotational forces and I'm too stupid to realize the picture is sideways   A wise choice my friend   Why would they not make Ted the godfather instantly? Lily and Marshal would never ever choose Barney to be a godfather, seriously. And then of course they all 3 are at the end, just like they were co-best men.  I know it's just a show but when it's this completely unrealistic with the gameshow and cheesy music it just makes it kinda cringeworthy   My shins were covered, and now they're not!   Ahh. Carry on then. I like your beaches by the way   And Washington is right up there in vegetable and fruit production, so why take resources from us?   Not even a verified email. Now that is self control   His brakes must not be working properly   I slept with the groom   [Fire!](http://33.media.tumblr.com/d396ead3cbd949800c7da543a57c8586/tumblr_mk30uzYly21s99m4bo1_500.gif)   That's faster than I run a 5k in..      What about the beard guy at the bottom left??   I took an uber on NYE in Seattle. Took like 20 minutes total to get to Capital Hill and cost like $10 if that, and the driver was awesome. Great service   What a terrible episode. Everyone is just a douchebag for no reason. And why on earth would Klaus be living with Ted, why would any of them want that? And Lily and Marshal just get written out because baby   So it's like the lottery whether I'll die or not   I gave my cat a bath today. From the sounds he was makin you'd think I was throwing him down a slide too   Seriously was that real like what the fuck?! I can't stop laughing though   For that price I'd never leave the room I'd just watch fish all day  	114
 At first I took offense for your comment, but in reality I shouldn't. You are absolutely correct that it is my fault for not taking the time to learn to read a book right. Upon further research, it isn't just me. The screw tape letters is just a hard book to comprehend, and that is the case with a lot of college freshman (based on amazon book reviews). I'm not trying to stray off from the fact that you are correct about my laziness, but upon further inspection of your profile comments, you are just a redditor that takes satisfaction in humiliating others. Every other comment on your profile is mean and negative.    Edit: Also, I made it pretty clear that it was a bad decision of mine to do what I did. I didn't ask for you to reiterate it. I asked if there were discussion groups for particular books where people like me can ask questions.   So, r/books, I am going to be 100% honest. I have never read a book in middle school or high school. I used spark notes for all of my quizzes and tests. This is now coming back to haunt me, but for the most part I am understanding The Golden String ( an autobiography). However, The screw tape letters is the most confusing thing I have ever tried to comprehend in my life. I know it is a pretty popular book, but for the life of me I have to study each and every sentence. What should I do? Are there any discussion groups that are linked to a book you are reading?   Oh my god, that is amazing.   It would be a lot more than a $2,000 payday, you are thinking of the on contract price of a phone ($99-199). A new iPhone 6/6 plus sells for ~ 500-700 dollars on eBay.   I am against a lot of the things in the show, but Transparent on amazon prime had an amazing pilot that had me hooked. Also, the youtube series called "theater class" is another one (a bit old) that had me hooked.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG5hUMSMD90 list=PL2410F0D08842A3E7   The lens on that camera (digisuper 95 by canon) costs roughly ~$140,000.   Please come to charlotte.   HERE IN MY GARAGE, MY NEW LAMBORGHINI. Damn, I'm tired of that advertisement.   post here if it gets sold, i am interested.   i.reddit.com is great for older devices too, especially an iPhone 4 running iOS 7.   What the fuck, somebody got that for $110k? That is an amazing looking house for that price point.   For some reason, this is the first comment on reddit that I have laughed at in a long time. Just imagining that shit flying off in the distance without your control makes me giggle.      Never^To^be^seen^again   I actually didn't know you could do that.

 I was very lonely when this all started. The more time goes by, I learn to appreciate being alone because it means I'm safe from harm. It seems like the website is being modeled after things I say. Must be why it links to my first post as well.   If you were stuck in a place like this for days on end with nothing to do, wouldn't you take the time to express yourself clearly? I do tend toward the side of verbosity in general though. Also, thank you! You're too kind.   Not only have I wondered if all of you aren't real, but also that only some of you aren't. Some of you may be trying to lead me astray. I hate that I can't trust all of you outright. I'm so alone and I need something to believe in.   I never did but a friend described it to me late one evening over a bottle of wine. A black and white film full of blood. Black blood...I can understand the usage on many accounts. God has definitely left this place behind.   That's puzzled me the most. Aside from the room in that diner, I haven't seen a single body anywhere.   darkRa1n provides a good summary down below. Thanks for the advice and you're absolutely right. I've got to stay strong.   No dice. All downloads say they won't be ready for 99 days. Strange because I can access sites nearly instantly. It feels almost like I'm just browsing a database of information.   Your name is an unpleasant reminder for me. Great detective work though. I'm not sure what all of this means but it gives me a lot to think about...things I wish I didn't have to think about.    nbsp;  I don't know if any of you can see it yet, but I keep seeing more and more things on the site every time I go back. I worry that this isn't the final version of screamlouder.   I've thought of that as well. I've thought of giving my IP to someone, I've looked high and low for a cellphone so maybe I could tether the connection and learn something that way (to no avail, I couldn't find a single one), I've tried to do many things but this computer is different, it's wrong. Everything I enter into the command line has weird results, and Netscape navigator on a computer running Windows 95 shouldn't be able to see anything on screamlouder. When you see compatibility for Chrome, Firefox, Internet Explorer, Safari, Opera...you don't see Netscape.   I'm hoping this works. God damnit, I'm fucking praying this works. It hasn't the last hundred times but maybe this will be the one that gets a response. I don't know how many more places I can post this. I feel like theres nowhere left to shout my message.  According to this computer, nobody has responded on any other site I visit, not just to me but to anything. Nothing ever gets updated, I don't see new statuses on Facebook, and I'm starting to wonder if this computer is even connected to anything at all.   If this does work, here's the first thing I need anyone who sees this to read: FIND ME. Please.   I cant really help you with this because there's nobody around to tell me where I am, but please try anyway. I haven't seen anyone since I got here and I haven't found any other ways to make contact. The phones are broken, the radios are weird...I happened upon this computer a few days ago and it seems like my only chance of getting out of this place.  Sadly I can't give you so much as a hint as to the name of this place, I haven't found any signs that say anything about a location. I'd tell you my name if that could help but first I need a response. I need to make sure I can trust whoever's on the other end, I hope you can understand.  Maybe a backstory is enough for now? I'll start with the last thing I remember before waking up here: I was excitedly preparing for a month long vacation from work to a pretty nice resort spot in Jamaica. I had a bunch of unused PTO, I was knee deep in code at work and I figured I needed a break. Hell, my coworkers were begging me to take time off. Apparently I looked exceptionally tired. As a web developer working for at least 30 different clients from a particularly small web firm, Id have to agree with them. The work was indeed exhausting. There's nothing too interesting about all this, but it's what led to the following events so I'm not sparing any details. I can't afford to, ya know?  I had just finished packing my car, my neighbors were ready to start collecting my mail, and I was about to head to the airport for my much needed R R when I remembered I wanted to take a decongestant so my ears wouldn't pop on the plane. I headed to the tidy kitchen in my lonely little house in the suburbs. Everything was spotless and as it should be which gave me comfort knowing it would be this way on my return. It was nice knowing I could just leave everything behind for awhile without worry. I needed a change of pace.   At least thats how I felt back then.   I grabbed a pill from my medicine cabinet. As a frequent allergy sufferer, I'd done this hundreds of times before so I wasn't paying attention as I popped the pill and chased it with a glass of water....god, why wasn't I paying attention?  I looked in the pill bottle as I was closing it and noticed the pills were the wrong color. What? They were supposed to be pink but these ones were white. They had never been white. Someone had been in my house and switched the pills...  Panic came over me instantly, I knew I had to act fast but I was stuck in that moment where you don't know what comes first. My heart was racing as I made up my mind. After a few moments of jumbled thought, I finally ran to the sink to make myself throw up.   but then my heart stopped racing. Then the panic went away.   I couldn't even reach up to my mouth to stick a finger down my throat. I closed my eyes and my face began to feel like cotton. My knees buckled and I collapsed. Moments before I blacked out entirely I could feel something grabbing my legs and pulling me across the floor.  I awoke with a pounding in my head and the kind of dry throat where swallowing seemed to make it worse. The fear returned as if I had just been in my kitchen minutes ago, but the change in my surroundings told me it must have been much longer. I was in a broken spring bed with quilted blankets. There were dusty knick knacks and old furniture scattered about the bedroom and the walls were made of unfinished wood. It all reminded me of my grandparents cabin in the forest back home.  I creaked my aching bones out of the bed that was holding me. It felt like I hadn't moved in days. I made my way to the bedroom door, hoping to find a sink somewhere in this old place. I was so thirsty.  Upon exiting, I had to catch myself by grabbing hold of the doorframe. This was the second floor of a cabin that had been torn in half. The staircase and walls in front of me were completely gone, leaving a giant opening to the world outside. Everything else was in shambles. It looked like a tornado must have hit here.  I gazed out at the horizon. I was at the top of a small hill, surrounded by thick forest. There were tall mountains on all sides of this tiny valley, trapping the forest like a prison cell. At the bottom of the hill, following a clean paved road was a town. Early on, I was reassured by the sight of civilization.  I jumped down from the crumbling hallway onto a couch covered in cabin debris. The small bit of good news I found here was a sink at the back of the kitchen directly behind the couch, now completely exposed by the lack of separating walls.  The rusty faucet knob creaked as I turned it. I expected crisp, cool mountain water but instead a thick black sludge came oozing out. useless.  Instead of wasting my strength here, it was time I headed to the town below in search of water and hopefully an idea of where I was. After escaping the wreckage, it was nice to find solid footing even if it was unfamiliar ground. The walk down the road was almost pleasant, if not a little eery. It was quiet. Absurdly quiet. The leaves didn't rustle, there wasnt an animal in sight to make chirps or squeaks. The clouds were dark and heavy, but there was no rain, no wind. There was no change, everything seemed stagnant.  There was a gas station at the top edge of town along my descent. A sign across the entrance said shop quickly which puzzled me, but I was far more distracted by what I realized next. There was nobody filling up the cars parked by the fuel stations. There was nobody inside buying sodas or cigarettes. I walked up to the window of the station and there wasnt even anyone manning the register.  The door was unlocked. Hellllooooo?! I shouted as I grabbed some snacks and drinks from the shelves. I was met with no response, so I left some money on the counter and made a swift exit. Oh right, I used money from my wallet. This lead me to realize my captor had left me with my wallet, id, credit cards, and everything else I had on my person. What was going on here? What did they want from me?  The bottled water was stale but it felt good on my throat. I kept walking into town as I munched on some nearly expired potato chips. The buildings around me were old and poorly kept, full of broken windows and dented street signs. Street lamps had toppled over and cars were crashed into each other everywhere. Perhaps it was from the storm that destroyed that cabin on the hill. Maybe it was something else. I wouldnt know until I found someone with answers.  Yet there was no one to find! Everywhere I looked was empty. I thought I saw a shadow of someone in a window once but when I looked back they were gone. Later I thought I saw someone again but it was just a mannequin in a shop display. Its head was missing and in its place was that same black sludge from the faucet earlier, dripping slowly down its neck.  The more I looked, the more I noticed this sludge on random things across town. It was wiped on signs and billboards, fire hydrants, counter tops and registers in shops, and an old phone box on a street corner. A phone box? That meant a payphone! Here was a chance to finally call someone! I wish I had remembered to put my cell phone in my pocket before the kidnapping but I was too panicked to remember. This was just as good though, or at least I thought at the time. I put a coin in the slot and waited for a tone.  Now remember how I said the phones were broken? Well broken isnt exactly the word. Something much stranger was happening. Its one of several reasons I want to leave this place immediately. There was a dial tone after the coin had fallen into place but I hadnt pressed any of the numbers. There was a sound of connecting to the other line and everything after that I could hardly explain, but Ill try.  I was only listening with one ear but the sound was somehow binaural. It was all around me like surround sound, but the quality was still that of an old payphone which was a new and chilling sensation. I heard loud wind and thunder, windows crashing and muffled screaming as people ran by. I instinctively darted around trying to avoid the sounds like they were real. I was afraid something was going to break through the glass box I was in. There was the sound of a car running into the broken streetlamp in front of me and I heard the metal bending as if it was falling over for the first time.  Suddenly, just as it had started, everything stopped and I was left with the buzzing sound of silence. The air around me felt electrified and hot. After a moment of reprieve, I heard the thing behind me.   That moaning.   Ill never forget the sound. I could almost feel its vibrations on the back of my neck.   I slammed the receiver down and closed the payphone door behind me. I wasnt going to use another phone in this town as long as I was trapped here. I hurried down the street in front of me. then I passed down another. and another.   and another.   It was all the same! There was nothing! There was no one! All the exits from the town lead into dense forest followed by mountains that I couldnt possibly climb without gear. I was trapped here with nobody around to help me. I broke down and cried pathetically and without restraint. Why was this happening to me?! What had I done to deserve this? If they didnt want my money, what did they want from me?!  Then I heard it. Through my sobs was a voice talking in one of the buildings. FINALLY! Someone to talk to. There was someone here that could help me! I dashed inside the building where the sound was coming from. It looked to be an old radio station. There were big bold letters spelling out RMR behind the secretarys desk. The front door was removed from its hinges and missing, along with all the other doors inside.  I could hear a man speaking casually to someone on one of the floors upstairs, I was so relieved. I ran up the stairs like a child on Christmas morning, careful to avoid the chunks of concrete that had fallen from the ceiling. It was once I reached the sixth floor that I knew I was close to the source. I walked past the open rooms until I saw where the sound was coming from.  In the third room on the left from the stairs was the station control room. There was an old record spinning on a vintage record player next to a dusty microphone above all the station controls. The record was making that snapping, crinkling sound that old records do. The man speaking on the record must have been a disc jockey from an old 50s radio show. I had caught him in the middle of a news bulletin as I walked into the room. Heres the word from the bird, looks like a storm tonight, and its gonna be a doozy. To all you paper shakers and big daddys playing back seat bingo out at the passion pit, dont be a wet rag and get yourselves home. Heres a little something to help you lay a patch. Play that number, Suzy!  Just as he finished his sentence the record cut out to the most shrill high pitched sound Id ever heard. It was so loud it sounded like it was coming from inside my head. Then it switched over to radio static mixed with a gurgling sound like someone was shouting underwater. The sound hurt me to my core, I could feel it inside me, invading my brain. I grabbed the record player and threw it against the wall and watched it smash into dozens of pieces. What the fuck was happening here?! I felt like I was losing my mind! I flipped the radio controls hoping to reach someone.  Is anyone there? Can you read me? Hello hello! I must have flipped every switch in there but it was no use. There was no response. Nothing. Then there was a knock. It came from out in the hall. After the phone and the radio I became suspicious of pursuing any more sounds, but what choice did I have? If I waited here in this town long enough I would die. The food would expire, I would run out of clean water, and that would be it. I didnt have the luxury of just hiding away and I certainly wouldnt make it in the forest. I wish Id paid more attention in Boy Scouts.  Another knock. I was terrified, but I slowly inched my way out into the hall. I went past three more open rooms and found the source. this was the only room in the whole building that had a door. Next to it was a small desk with a drawer. The knocking continued.  is anyone there? There was another knock. Hold on, Im going to open the door. I jiggled the handle. No good, it was locked. I shifted to the table and opened the drawer. As I expected there was a key. Actually there were six keys. I wondered what the other five were for. I grabbed the first and slid the key into place. There was a click and the door unlocked.   Okay, Im coming in. I said with a shaky voice. I opened the door and there was another knock.   In front of me was another door.   Now I understood what the other keys were for. Whatever was behind here needed to be kept hidden. It needed to be kept restrained. So much so that one door wouldnt be enough. I was trembling as I reached for another key. I knew it was stupid but I didnt know what else to do. Whatever brought me to this town couldnt be behind this door. You cant lock it from the inside. That means its still out here so Im in just as much danger. I unlocked another door.   Another knock.   The knocks were getting louder, whatever it was seemed to be growing impatient. I reached for another key and unlocked another door. Please, stop knocking. Im going to open the doors okay? Im coming in. but it continued. I unlocked another door and the knocking stopped. Now it was slamming itself into the door with full force. Boom! I could almost hear the door cracking on the other side. I didnt know if I should continue at this point because the thing inside was getting aggressive. then again, maybe they needed help just like me. Maybe if we could work together we might be able to get out of here. I caved and let myself unlock another door. BANG! It slammed again. Then there was just one key. One more door. The booming was so rapid and the door looked as if it was breathing each time the thing rammed into it. I was so scared but I wasnt going to give up. BOOM! Another crash into the door. Curiosity was taking over me and I had to know what was waiting on the other side. BANG! Another slam against the wood. I grabbed the key from the drawer and slowly clicked it into place.  The banging stopped. The knocking stopped. It was silent. I slowly turned the metal handle, with no idea what might be on the other side. Whatever it was, it needed six doors just to be contained. There isnt a thing alive that needs that much restraint. My brain was screaming at me to turn around and leave but Id already committed. I was about to see what was inside.   I swung the door open.   The room inside was caked in dust. there was black and white checkered tile flooring and no windows to be seen. Above were fluorescent lights that flickered, struggling to stay lit. It looked like nobody had stepped foot in here for years. I was tense and proceeded cautiously. There was nobody inside. There was nothing here. No tables or chairs, completely empty. I started to sigh in relief when I heard something. It was the whir of a computer turning on. In the center of this otherwise empty room was an old beige computer. It booted up with the classic windows 95 sound, although very offkey, like the internal sound card was broken far beyond repair.  I was still pretty terrified, but at least now I had a computer. Albeit an old one. I saw an internet cable running out of the back, the monitor was functional, things were looking up a little.  I sat down in front of it. I really wish there had been a desk but it was just sitting alone in the middle of this dusty floor. That might explain why the sound was off and the colors were wonky. The dust had probably been getting into all the circuits over the years, I was lucky it even booted up at all.  It loaded the windows 95 user interface with only one icon on the desktop. No My Computer, no recycle bin. Just Netscape Navigator directly in the center of the screen. I double clicked it. The dial up window appeared, but instead of boxes for my information or a place to put in the ip address, etc. it had a single button that said connect?  It was weird that the button had a question mark. It was almost like it was asking me a question instead of giving me an option. I clicked it and waited. Suddenly the old dial up tone started but it sounded completely wrong. Later I managed to search youtube from this computer so I could provide you with an example of what it sounded like because if you hear it youll understand why this doesnt just seem like a broken sound card. Youll know why Im so afraid and why I want to be found.   Trust me though, what youre about to hear isnt nearly as terrifying as what I heard, its just the closest I could find:   [Dial Up sound](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF2v32xCD0Y)   Its been a few days now since finding the computer. Nothing too strange has really happened since then. I keep finding more black sludge around town as Ive been exploring peoples homes for food and water. The sludge seems to appear most commonly on the front doors of homes, but also on many of the beds where I assume people slept. I moved a mattress that didnt have any sludge into this computer room so I could be nearby in case I get any replies. Im still not sure if Im connected but I seem to have access to everything on the internet so well wait and see.  So if anyone is out there and youre able to read this, please let me know. Im screaming across the web for help because Im very scared and very lonely! The clouds outside are getting darker every day and I still dont know where the person who took me here is, or what was knocking on those doors. If anything new happens or if I come across anything on this computer, Ill be sure to post an update. Bye for now  UPDATE:  What you're about to see (if you can even see it) might not make much sense. I found something on this computer yesterday that shook me to my core.   Please tell me if you can go to:   www.screamlouder.info   I dont know if anyone can, and I dont know if anyone should. I didnt even know people could see my first post until recently.   The link was just sitting there in a .txt file, tucked away in My Documents with a single line reading To help you scream at night. I didnt need to click on it. I shouldnt have. but what would you do, being trapped in a place like this? I said I wanted answers and I got them. I honestly cant tell if this is just a joke, or a pet project from someone at the radio station. Someone with time on their hands and a sickness, remedied only by their own grand delusions.  but I guess Ive recently developed some pretty awful delusions as well. Its been two weeks now, and aside from the stuff I mentioned in my first post, there hadnt been much activity until yesterday. I dont know if its the paranoia setting in after finding screamlouder.info, but Im seeing things now. Hearing things. Moving shadows in the abandoned remnants of homes, the sound of wind where I cant feel a single hair move above my head... And all your comments, Ill read them but sometimes they dont look right. Sometimes they sound wrong in my head. They scare me. Then I look again, and I understand that Ive received nothing but kind words and different methods to get out of here.  That reminds me, I tried to leave. It was 2 days ago. I thought there might be a path through the mountains somewhere. I packed a backpack full of food and supplies and made my way through the forest. After a mile or so, I came to a river. Completely black. The sludge blocked my way.  I followed it all the way around town and back behind the cabin on the hill. Ive been on an island this whole time! I found a road leading to a bridge west of the radio station, but it had collapsed into the sludge below. I threw a log into the stuff at one point to see if I could swim through and it sank like itd fallen in tar. I imagined myself in place of the log, slowly sinking, deeper and deeper until the black ooze filled my lungs. I wept.   Im losing hope by the minute you guys, and I dont know how much more I can take. Worse than everything though, was last nights incident   It was maybe 11 or 12 oclock at night and I couldnt sleep. Too many questions were buzzing in my head. I decided to go for a walk to clear my mind and get some air. Typically a fools choice this late at night, but strangely the electricity still works here and the street lights were lit up on all the poles that hadnt fallen. It provided me with sight and a sense of security. With or without light though, If it meant getting away from that computer room for awhile, Id take my chances.  Id just passed the street where I laid out some parking cones reminding me to stay away from that awful payphone, when I noticed a building that I must have seen a dozen times but never really bothered to look at. Through the windows I could see chrome rimmed tables and chairs, booth seating stretching from one end to the other, and framed pictures of places around town I could already identify (Im becoming too familiar with this place, god I want to leave). The sign above the building was brightly lit with some of the letters burnt out. Au_ie _ays Diner This must have been the diner from that website. I hated the thought of exploring unfamiliar territory after dark but I needed to make a connection, find some semblance of understanding in this place before I could sleep again. If this yokal restaurant had real answers waiting for me inside, nothing could keep me out.  The front door swung open effortlessly. Looks like the locking mechanism had been torn off in the storm. To my right in this darkened room was a lightswitch that, after several flicks from my hand, proved itself unusable.   click   The flashlight I took from my stash of emergency gear shot a stream of light at the kitchen behind the front counter. Hundreds of empty pie tins were stacked from floor to ceiling, covering every square inch of the room. Award winning pies was an understatement for this level of disarray.  Stumbling over broken plates and stray tins, I wandered into the hallway behind the counter in search of a circuit breaker. I kept my eyes forward and alert while I brushed my hand against the wall, hoping to catch the change from wallpaper to metal. Near the end of my path, I felt a wet spot. Shivers went down my spine as I shined the light on my fingers.   Black.   Hoping it wasnt what I thought it was, I brought my fingers to my nose and sniffed.   It smelled like berries and corn syrup. Thank god, just pie filling.   I shined my light over to the spot on the wall Id just touched, and noticed a crease in the wallpaper. I followed it up the wall and then over and down again. It was in the shape of a door. Someone had sealed a room off from the rest of the diner.  Hundreds of pie tins crashed as I shuffled my way into the kitchen. I needed a knife to cut through the paper. I spotted one on the stove that was covered in pie filling. It seemed like thats all theyve been serving for a long time now.  I returned to the door, put down my flashlight, and dug the serving knife into the wall where the creases lay. As I dug, I noticed a flow of air from the room. It carried with it a sickly sweet smell. The scent of a secret decayed by neglect.  After I sliced through the perimeter, I felt for the spot where a knob should have been. Instead there was a hanging ring handle inlaid into the wood of the door. After cutting a hole, I grabbed the handle and pulled. The inside was dark. I heard a drawn out gloop and squelch as something from the ceiling fell to the floor. I picked up my flashlight and peered inside. The walls and ceiling were coated inches thick in blackberry filling. It looked like week old coagulated blood, and it didnt smell much better. I held my shirt above my nose to keep from inhaling too much of it. I quickly shined my flashlight around the room and there in the back corner was a blob of flesh. Man or woman I wasnt certain but they must have been five or six hundred pounds if not more. They sat there completely naked and lathered in pie filling, motionless against the wall. They must have added to the stench weeks or even months ago. It was a renaissance painting of the path to hell via gluttony.   I stumbled backwards with dry, night-terror screams. I couldnt handle this, none of it made sense, and I needed to leave! NOW! but I couldnt feel my legs! I just stood there motionless in the dark, completely escaped from my body, repeating in my head what the fuck is happening?!  Then I caught my breath, eyes returned to focus, and I booked it without looking back. I screamed through the empty town, with no response but my own echoes off the nearby rubble. I ran up the stairs of the radio station, tripping over myself on the way. I hid in my bed for the rest of the night, eyes wide open peering through my sheets. unblinking.  That brings us to now. I knew this, more than ever, was when I needed to call for help again. I see your comments, I know youre out there...I just wish I knew you were real and not just in my head. I cant believe any of this! How does a place like this exist and more importantly, who or what killed the person in that hidden room? I know I said I was lonely before, but now I pray more than anything that Im alone.   I'm not ready to give up on leaving this place quite yet. I'll keep you all posted if anything else happens.   I think that more than anything is what scares me. Nobody else has used this computer. I don't know how they found out about my post and I don't know how they updated the site so quickly. Maybe when I've gone out scavenging for food and supplies they've come into this room and done things. Or perhaps there's another computer still working somewhere else in town. I'm not certain how alone I am anymore.   It seems like everything here is encouraging me to scream. Louder and louder. Something wants me to be heard...something wants you to hear me.   What scares me the most is how much I really don't know yet. All of what you say could be true or none of it could be true. All of you could be true, and yet....no. It doesn't matter what's true. What matters is that I get out of this place and never come back. I'm so tired of this awful town.  	13

Can someone keep an active tally of how many times our new glorious leader dances around the issues?   **SORRY CITIZEN, YOU'RE ASKING TOO MANY POIGNANT QUESTIONS.  BANNED!**   Listen, pal, the CEO is here to dance around hard questions and get popular approval for his upcoming banhammer by shrouding himself in the cloak of anti harassment.     This was not the best fighter award.  This was the best female athlete award.  And this gif is stupid and pointless.   Jesus Christ, this shit again?   I don't understand either.  The whole premise of that show is that Bones, the fucking title character, is a skeptic of anything supernatural, and goes out of her way to disprove stupidity her entire career.   seriously.  I've never even contemplated a 6 team league.  Anything below 12 seems boring and too shallow.   even in dynasty?   WRONG Shitlord!  Slaves aren't entitled to shit!   This is the kind of post that should be in /r/bestof.  Not the same old trite bullshit that's been filling the sub recently  *"this was the top comment of a post that was on the front page with 5000 upvotes"*    You sound like those republicans who started bashing Obama as soon as he was president from day 1.  "Oh he shook the marine's hand!  Terrible presidential protocol!" "Oh my god, he fucking BOWED to a jap and respected their culture!!  How unamerican!!"  Before he even started actually doing the stuff they were truly angry about, like talking about torture, Gitmo, gay rights, DADT, and healthcare.  And now you're angry at everyone for not jumping on your bandwagon.  We hated the last CEO towards the end of her tenure after she did a bunch of stupid shit.  This guy hasn't even done anything yet.  Nothing.  Oh wait, he talked about doing something.  Totally the same thing, my bad.   shhhh   Yeah, I trotted him out there for a while, but his inability to fill up the QS category hurts too much.   Man, Oswaldo Arcia is frustrating.  Holding on to him in a dynasty league, since there's not much else out there besides Melky.   Oh.  Good thing you refuted my claim with actual arguments.   So something that's literally been on the front page via 4 different subs is somehow bestof?   Dude   Thanks Dana.  I didn't realize that companies want to sponsor fighters when they aren't visibly supporting their brand.   not with all those jews around   **DO YOU UNDERSTAND THE WORDS COMING OUT OF MY MOUTH?!?!?**   I don't get the comparison.  Kevin is black and looks kind of like him, and has a similar high pitched shouting voice.  His jokes are nothing like Tucker's.  His on stage demeanor (not voice) is nothing like Tucker's.  His acting skills or lack there of are nothing like Tucker's.  This just seems to be some retarded joke that just won't die.   damn.  myth busted quickly on that one   God Damn.  I would have thought this would come as common sense to fellow ex-muslims who face similar struggles.   So, basically whoever predicted that Ellen Pao was a scapegoat for unpopular whitewashing of Reddit was right?   He can channing all over my tatum any day.

You work at Love Field Airport or something?   Not if you live in the UK.   Yeah, but the new layout sucks donkey balls   Yeah, the money looks funny to us Americans.  I was in Toronto on a business trip, and my boss wanted some coffee for a couple of us.  I asked him for some cash, cause all I had was US currency.  He just looks at a stack of Canadian money with a perplexed look, and randomly pulls two bill out and gives them to me, and asks "Is this enough?"  He gave me two hundred dollar bills.   Can someone fill me in on this?  I don't know if it's a big enough issue to post to /r/OutOfTheLoop    Also, Africa is a country, and Pakistan is the middle east.   did someone take away your gold?  I don't see it   Yishan looks more childish and petty the more he participates in reddit.   Yup.  Sister moved from DC to Chicago, and said that it was a shit show, and said she preferred DC.  Fucking DC!   Seriously, I don't get why anyone is complaining.  The children got across safely, didn't they?   It's not just the short term success that people in Dallas are excited about with Stephen Jones.  It's the idea that Jerry isn't drafting players anymore, fucking up the franchise's chances for more long term success.

Thus, the success   please send help   What are your opinions on Oreck brand vaccums. They are bagged units, so would they be serviceable over a Dyson? Especially if Kirby or miele are out of the budget.   YES!!!   What'd he say?   No search and sort funtionality, no more user reviews, no more separate page for each tv or movie title.

Yup, this thread will probably get deleted for not abiding by the new era hugbox rules.   Snake oil is for chumps.  Rhino horn powder is where the real medicine is at.   It's like when a black guy comes into a porno where the white dude was all excited and ready to fuck the girl.   Houston's zoning laws, or lack thereof, are such a clusterfuck, that we had a full day's lesson on them in one of my law school classes.  Can't seem to remember which one, though.  Maybe Contracts.   Yeah, Colin Cowherd is being a real punk bitch defending him this morning.  I hate how he just ends arguments with "so?"  "So what if he didn't call Cuban back?"  He thinks this somehow makes his weak argument morally superior somehow, and ends the conversation.   Is there any more of this type of uncensored reality TV nudity somewhere?  Asking for a friend.   Damn, these black and white photos had me fooled.   Can the Mavs use him?   have you seen the East?   That's literally the exact opposite of having huge balls.   The owner's daughter is hot.   For real.  No one is beating those two teams.  Spurs might just sleep through the first half and then go full Popovich on everyone's ass all the way to the finals.   Isn't it official Reddit policy for the CEO to trash fired employees, anyway?  So why not talk shit   Johnson is not available in Yahoo yet   What kinda football stuffs?   Stars lending their jet.  This is a Metroplex effort.   close enough   Yeah, I went back into yesterday's thread and read up on it.  Thanks   What am I missing here?  Off reddit for two days and I miss some shit   Admins can sticky their responses to remain visible despite downvotes.    I want them to make buddy cop movies when they're done with basketball.  But different movies, not a series.  Like, they play the exact same stereotype characters in each movie, and the story is practically identical, but it's just a different movie.      Fuck Olly   Serious question, why is this guy being downvoted?  Is it because he's pimping out his product?   without the pasties, please   I'm quite happy with out injury prone guard and one trick pony acquisitions, thank you.   This isn't funny as much as it is hot.   I guess this is a problem in bigger cities.  I've never seen this out in the suburbs.  Hell, is Torrance a suburb?   Why wouldn't you believe?

Dana's always been a piece of shit who would rather risk his fighters' safety for views   Seriously, did Victoria piss off Pao or something?   So, Susac's value still holds, right?   I have him in dynasty, just riding that bench.  When I look up his stats in the minors, he seems to be struggling hard.  Minnesota people, what's the word?  Is he gonna get a second chance, or are they moving on?   Yeah, 2006 finals comes to mind.   Link his blog, bro   Thanks, Dr. Nick   No more Tom Cruise jokes?   But Roddy Bobouis turned into a perennial allstar, right?   I think that the 2011 Championship covered up a lot of weaknesses in this organization and allowed people to keep jobs they shouldn't have.  Donnie as a talent evaluator is just abysmal.   Also, Hope allegedly threatened them   Wasn't he defending his own mother when Hope was attacking her?   Noobish question.  How do I keep track of units?  I generally bet flat percentages of my bankroll, so that number changes all the time.  So, if I have a $100 bankroll, I bet a flat 10% on my bets.  But that doesn't mean that my unit is $10, right?  Cause that 10% will cause the bet amount to change daily.     You started with 500 and went up to 22000?  How big were the bets you were placing?  Were you betting flat percentages?   almost too easy.  UFC is so eager to put a fucking belt on Connor's nuts, they've shielded him from wrestlers all this time.

 Nofap won't magically make you into a better (wo)man. You won't magically start to see girls queue up around you. Your muscles won't magically grow but nofap does give you the drive to make these things happen. It takes time and persistence but in the end you will be more confident (and clear headed) but only if you force yourself into certain situations.  You won't get a girl by sitting on reddit all day. Just go out into the world and meet people (I know, I know easier said than done but it's possible). And I know  it sounds cheesy but just be yourself. Girls must be sick to death of sex obsessed men who just want to get into their pants. Talk to them like you would anyone else and you might find that you really like her. Don't get down if you get rejected a few times.  You won't find going to the gym any easier (if you're new there) and it won't make lifting any lighter but it might give you an extra drive (and a way to get all of your energy out without fapping) and it will make you feel better afterwards.   So go outside (even if it's just for a walk, make yourself walk for one or two hours everyday) and you might be all the better for it. Learn to cook there are quite literally millions of videos on youtube! Start drawing, if all you can do is stick figures, who cares keep going (every master was once a begginer). Learn a language, play and instrument, volunteer! There's so much ***you*** could be doing right now, so go and start.   Nofap is about persistence and patience and hard work and it won't pay off unless you make it.   I'm not 100% sure why it happens but many people report getting deeper voices around the 30 day mark. Don't quote me on it but I think it's to do with the increase in testosterone.   Yeah, as far as "superpowers" go it's just a word to say mkre confident, happier etc (I'm sure  you know that but I can see how it can be taken the wrong way). It won't take down the porn industry but I guess some people believe it will.   Shit aye!    Ha, ha awesome.   Ha, ha I know the feeling. Why is it that whenever you read something scary at 2am you have to pee?   Woohoo! Glasgow man myself, what about you?   Scotland :)   Good luck man! :D   I stopped shaving down there when I started nofap, cause I often found I would get a boner and relapse when shaving.   Don't reset but don't do it again. You're teasing yourself. I suggest you just move it to the side when you shave/trim down there.   Definitely get you thinking.   Ha, ha woohoo!   It might be the norm but that doesn't make it right! Look at what the people here on nofap have went through. Slavery was once the norm, so was burning women at the stake for witchcraft, did that make any of that right?   Awesome and kudos, the subs has grown a lot in just one day. Hopefully the viewings go well.   I guess all of her dreams were clouds in the coffee?   Why not make a conoetition out of it? :)   I can name more, there are many in Eastern Asia and throughout Africa. Porn isn't eeded to masturbate. I could link you to more who don't "fuck each others brains out every night"   Certain african tribes, like the ones in this [article](http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2012/12/where-masturbation-and-homosexuality-do-not-exist/265849/) find it to be an alien concept.   Yeah, no. Point and case, nofap.   Ha, ha thanks. By the way you have a real talent. I especially like [this](https://www.facebook.com/JCMRArt/photos/pb.1594122477512638.-2207520000.1437505358./1622249118033307/?type=3 theater) one, the profile picture and [this](https://www.facebook.com/JCMRArt/photos/pb.1594122477512638.-2207520000.1437505345./1622380971353455/?type=3 theater) one. Seriously, I'm impressed!!   Ha, ha I'm Devlin. I'll go check out your art :)   Yeah, that got me too.      Awesome, I'll gi and have a look. I like big hiro 6, it was a pretty fun movie. Now I want to see you play that triangle :) (can you send me a link  o your art?)   Ha, ha triangle is awesome!! (I think?). I love toy story but finding nemo and the incredibles are my favourites, I also like brave but their new mivie inside out is pretty good. Guitar, no not really. I considered learning it and i might in the future but for now no. How long have you been into art?   At the beggining. Hi, I suggest you install a porn blocker and maybe find a new hobby (exercise, reading, music?) Then make yourself do the things you want to do, force yourself if you have to.   Hey, 16 [M]. I like music (I play the piano and keyboard). I could talk my life away when it comes to history and I have a soft spot for pixar movies. I love lewrning about other cultures (from Scotland) so I'd like to talk to some people here and help along with nofap.   I'm not going to write a review of any kind, I'm just going to talk a bit about this book.  I'm really into history, I've read and studied for hours on end about all sorts of things. I spent a long time studying the time periods between 1850-present (although I love ancient history and, well any history really). I heard for years that I should read: "All Quiet on the Western Front" but I always put it off because I was reading sonething else. I finally got round to it.   When people talk sbout Germany the topic always seem to turn to Hitler and often people are severely under-educated on the subject matter. I really feel sympathetic for the German people of today. They don't feel pride for their country because of what happened.     Anyway, the book focuses on a group of German soldiers during the first world war and it really captures the essence of innocence lost. Even though the book is a work of fiction it tugs at the hearts strings because to many people went through these situations. It shows that the German troops were just as annoyed about the war as the allied countries.   It also captures the feeling of camaraderie that was the high point of life in the trenches, like I said this is not a review but I do feel like anyone interested  in war, history or simply looking for their next read should pick up this book.     Don't get me wrong we're close and we share a lot of stuff. I'll talk to him later. (Tonight)   Try going to the sidebar and find where it says:  "Show my flair on this subreddit it looks like:"  And make sure there is a tick in the box. If it doesn't work message a moderator.   We're twins so it'd be pretty awkward talk...   I woukd consider them to be, yes.   Sorry about that but don't let it define you. Just go out and be confident and friendly and I kno it sounds cheesy but be yourself. Don't just think about sex and you might meet a nice girl, that first kiss might not be far away.   Ha, ha.   Hopefully nofap will fix that, stay strong.   Ha, ha sounds stupid but it does work. But be careful, it can make it look like you had an "accident".   So I walked in on my brother, let's say, jerkin the gerkin'. I immeadiately closed the door but he was obviously embarassed which reminded me one (of the many reasons) that I'm abstaining from fapping.   The embarassment on his face showed me how shamed he was. People talk about it like it's normal and healthy and that "everyone does it" but if these were true then why do people get so embarassed when the subject matter comes up?     I know I never.   I agree. In many cultures no one masturbates and no one cares, it's not essential.   Wow. That's weird, I practice lucid dreaming and I hear a lot of people get sleep paralysis (like you said evil figures and feeling an evil presence). I'm fortunate that I haven't went through it... yet but if I do I hope I don't shit myself (kiding... kinda). I only practice dream induced lucid dreaming so the risk is low.   I agree.   Hw, ha sorry about that.   "What is the story behind your username?"  It's posted so often.   Masturbating and porn have become the social norm and anyone who decides not to partake in such activities are often thought of as taboo or weird. So if you google is masturbating healthy or is porn normal/good it will come up with millions of people saying how healthy and natural it is. That is why this sub gets little attention. A lot of people also think it's weird and "culty".   Camping eh? To begin with hide it by pointing it upwards towards your belly button. Here is an [article](http://m.wikihow.com/Get-Rid-of-an-Unwanted-Erection) that might help you.   Don't get me wrong I want to have sex, I do. But it will happen when it happens and with someone I care about. To be honest most people our age are virgins, some might lie but most are. I think nofap has helped a bit but I never really talk about it. Don't be scared, so you haven't had sex, it's no big deal.   It leads to relapse no matter who is doing it.   Awesome, enjoy your hike.   Good idea!   That took balls. Good job man.   What other trails have you complete and how much, on average does it cost per trip?   Yeah nothing more came of it. I don't know if that's why we moved, I was pretty young, but I think it was one if the reasons. I don't know if the dream meant anything or if that guy was actually real or not but he was creepy as fuck!    16 here, I don't care about it. I'll lose it when I have a girl I care about not just some girl to have it done with.    When you struggle don't convince yourself that edging is ok. Just do something, anything, to get your mind off of it. Edging *will* lead to a relapse and if it doesn't it will likely lead to blue balls. If any of you have ever had this the pain is excruciating!   I'm writing this cause I've seen a ton of posts recently about people who are edging. So if you consider it try and get it off of your mind and if you start think about the pain you'll feel if you continue.      Yeah, I agree.   Oops typo.   'How you holding up?' Asked my mum as we arrived home from my best friends funeral, she died in a car crash just over a week ago  I look at her and she can tell I'm hurting:  'I'm, ok. I'm just gonna go up to bed'.  She leaves me as I retreat to my place of solace. I lie in bed and think about all the stuff we did together, we were friends practically since birth. Her name was Liara and she was only sixteen!   I fall asleep and dream about my recently deceased pal.  Bleep.  I hear the familiar sound alerting me that I've just recieved a text message. I take my phone and stare in horror, the screen reads:  "1 unread message from Liara"  A million and one thoughts rush through my mind and I finally decide to open it, it simply reads:  'Hey'  I immediately respond:  'Who is this?'  Bleep  'It's me, Liara, wanna do something later'  I reply straight away  'I don't know who's doing this but it's not funny, have some god damn respect for the dead' send.  A tear fills my eye.  Bleep.  'What do you mean respect for the dead? Are you feeling ok?'  The text message makes me want to punch something, someone is using my best friend, my dead best friend's phone to taunt me!  'I don't care who you are, just stop. It's not funny!'  The phone rings after I send the last text. Caller ID says it's liara. I answer it and practically scream the words:  'Fucking stoo it, Liara was buried less than two hours ago, don't you have any fucking respect!!'  'What are you talking about, I'm right here' replies the person on the end of the phone... Liara.  'Wh-what?! How. We, we burie-' I reply in shock  'I don't know why you're acting so weird, I'm fine, it must've been a nightmare'  I convince myself she's right but I'm still shaking from the shock. Then she says something, something Liara would never say...        I would continue but I have to go, nice writing prompt though.   I agree. I hate the word "hater" as well. People are allowed to have negative view points and the second they express them they are labelled as a "hater". I don't particularly like pewdiepie (I find him annoying) but his fanbase are the worst! If anybody says anything that isn't:  "I love you pewds you're so funny!!! :D :D D"  Then they get attacked by strangers on the internet (point and case: this tifu).   Ha, ha!!   _  ~  -    Yeah there's like eight. They always conplain about how school is useless and what not, most of them leave in fourth year (High school, it's when they're 16).   I agree with the junk food point, I've eaten considerably less than before. Also the sleeping. I've had much better sleeps.    I obviously don't know you guys but if, like you say, you haven't changed then it might be jealousy. If girls prefer you they might feel threatened. I might be wrong though so take it with a pinch of salt.   No man (I don't see a counter anyway) it wasn't intentional and you immediately turned it off, well done.   I don't know how you've changed, if your more confident now and better to be around it could be a simple jealousy complex?   Not to be mean but man up. If you can't go one week without touching your dick then maybe you shouldn't be here. We all know it's hard (no pun intended) but you should do it, not for your girlfriend, but for yourself!   I have an average body but it seems to me that all of those body builder type people are vanity obsessed jackasses. I wouldn't become one but, meh. I'm going to start the gym in august when school goes back then jog home rather than take the bus.   I'll die before I see your evil scheme come to throughistion. You won't touch dogs or hoomans!!   We here at dogfort signifigantly outnumber you feline fanatics and could break you like a twig.   Thanks, I wonder why  mines last so long compared to everyone else?    In the US, this war is worldwide!!   Cat dominance?! Even the hoomans are on our side!   Liar! The hoomans are on our side!!   Done.      As a catholic I pray but not for help with nofap (I ask God to help keep me going but that's all) I do meditate though which is very useful.   I suggest that you stick with nofap, no maturbating or porn. Have sex with your gf whenever you want/can but don't masturbate. It should take between 60 and 120 days (likely 90) before you recover from PIED.   I'm going to cancel my xbox live membership when school goes back (sinve I started nofap I've found it boring and I've got a lot more done). I'll substitute it for a gym membership and focus on cardio and lifting.    I walk for two hours every day so I'm in decent shape and I eat pretty healthy and drink plenty of water (around 1.5l a day).   I don't go to the gym or anything yet but I'm weary because when people get good looking bodies (mines is ok, I'm a good weight and all) they change and become obsessed with vanity. Did you guys?   Don't mention it :)   Aww!!   Don't do it, it sounds stupid but it could lead to a relapse.   I'm the exact same!! Day 11 here, videogames have been a huge part of my life for years but the past 4 days they've been boring, in that time I've learned a few new recipes (I normally never cook), read more, went outside more and spent more time with my family! I feel great!!    Don't reset, you were unconscious so it wasn't a decision you made.    Fish... with whipped cream.   Ha, ha good luck.   Awesome! Good for you, I hooe you meet a bunch of great people and continur on nofap!!    God, I'm sorry. I suggest you stick with nofap and I don't mean to sound to forward, but maybe also see a therapist? Just to help you through. Of course it your choice, good luck on your journey. I can't just say this but try and trust people, I don't kniw how you feel but try, you might just meet someone you like. Good luck.   Let's nit, I hate heat!   If I go outside at that time I'd probably freeze :D   Ha, ha I'm sure it could.  **Edit** I just noticed I started every sentence with ha, ha.   Sure, I love writing.   Ha, ha Scotland is hardly exotic, if anything it's the opposite. It always rains here and it's cold 99% of the time.   [Sia: Fire meet Gasoline](https://m.youtube.com/?#/watch?v=fNdeLSKSZ1M)   Ha, ha it's 9.20am here. (Scotland)   That's too bad. Hopefully you can help her get through it.          Oh my god! You're right!   Ha, ha advantage!?   Good luck with it, I hate eye pain.   I've been meaning to learn for a long time so I finally did it and they were surprisingly good.   Aaaaw ouch. Heal soon OP   Well America and Russia are constantly arguing over who is hotter, North Korea is a weird goth who just wants to be on her own but is constantly making idle threats for attention. Japan is kinda cute, she's creative. France has an "amazing accent" all of the girls LOVE him! Scotland is ginger, but pretty awesome. Norway is cool they are pretty unique. I think china is a bit of a bully but a lot of people like her.   England is a snooty bitch. Ireland is awesome, she believes in a lot of oretty cool things. Wales has a funny sense of humour. Spain and italy are absolutely beautiful! Greece is a history nerd but he's very cultured. Mexico gets bullied a bit by America but it's not so bad and he's pretty badass. Canda is cold but beautiful. She's distant but when you get to kniw her she's pretty great. Australia can cook! But his parents always give him into trouble for swearing and violence.     Finally learned how to cook pancakes.   So here is what I wrote in the original post  - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -   When I was a kid my family and I moved to the countryside. For the first four years we lived in a small town which was fine but we eventually moved, quite litterally to the middle of nowhere. It was this one street town with like 4 houses. It was ok because I spent most of my time indoors anyway (I've always been indoors-ey). The house we were living in was big, much bigger than anything I had ever stayed in before (before we moved to the countryside we lived in a suburban area of a city with a pretty big home, then a small town, then the middle of nowhere). Most of the bedrooms were upstairs but there was one down stairs. Everytime you went in it it was cold, when I say cold I mean it felt like ice, you could always see your breath. So, as a rule, I stayed out of there. The rest of the house was awesome and my brothers and sisters and I had a pretty cool time living there but I started getting horrible feelings whenever I went near the cold room: My eyes would water like I was going to cry, I would get a sore chest. I always tried to keep myself calm by explaining to myself that it was just me, I got a sore chest because of my asthma, I had watery eyes because of some other reason I'm sure I found less than convincing. The part that gets creepy was when our kitchen was being remodeled. Because of the layout of the kitchen we had to move the fridge into the cold bedroom untill the remodelling was finished. I couldn't stand going in there and eventually I straight out refused. You see I spend a lot of time with my two dogs (who were younger at the time) since I'm almost always inside and whenever they went near that room they would show their teeth and raise their hackles, which they virtually never do. One night I fell asleep and had this nightmare. In it I went into the room to get something as fast as I possibly could but then the door slammed shut and I couldn't open it for the life of me. On the other side my brother was trying to force it open. Then this man appeared he was clothed in a huge black cloak and started mumbling words I couldn't make out before he started choking me. I woke up coughing like mad and had, what I call, a "mini" asthma attack. I told my mum the next morning and she starred as if looking through me not at me. Then she said: 'XboxG4mer I had the exact same dream' She never wanted to freak me out so straight away she comforted me by telling me it was just a dream. I kept having the same nightmare and I never asked her but I think my mum did too because after a couple of months we moved away. The man in the dream was old but looked wholly evil. I don't know what happened in that house but there was something about that room. Nothing could warm it and the eery sensations I got when near it were stronger than any I've ever felt.  - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -   UPDATE:    So I spoke with my mum about the house. She said she felt the same (she has gone through quite a lot as far as paranormal sightings go) by that I mean she has seen her fair shair of... whatever you want to call them. She said in her dream it was her being choked and she woke up in a state of sleep paralysis. When she managed to get back to sleep she had the dream again but this time I was in the room and she was trying to get in.   The house was built around one hundred years ago. The village used to be pretty popular, it had a mining tunnel, a school, a bar, train station and more but when we lived there it was dead.  I should also mention that it was pretty foggy in my mums mind. When I brought it up she remembered it but it was lime she hadn't thought about it in a long time.   I intend too   I'm not ready, I don't have anyone I care enough about and I'm still too young in my opinion.   I have it on in the background, I like St Andrews, I live around an hour from there (I have family there) so it's kinda cool to see it on tv. As far as the game goes I don't mind who wins I just like the way they're playing (I'm not  biggest golf fan).   Ha, ha I normally hate cat videos but I liked this very much.   You're right, they don't deserve mercy!!   I used to do it all the time as a child and a few months ago I tried for a couple of weeks but eventually gave up. Yesterday I said I want to LD so I started doing reality checks throughout the day (yesterday) (I remembered all of the research I had done previously) and vola! Last night I had an LD!!   Awesome, good that you're starting this. Sorry about all of the crap you've went through in the last year. Nofap is a nice thing because it helps motivate but make sure to take initiative and make things happen for yourself. As far as hair loss goes I can't really help I fortunately have long hair but I've read that it helps a lot of people. Good luck!!   I was surprised myself that it lasted so long, I hear they tend to be really short. I wonder why it lasted so long? I'll try that during my next LD. Thank you.   No, it has to have impact.   Nofap is what you need, if you know you have these issues then 90 days should be your goal, then 120, then stopping all together (don't fap at 90 then 120, just set goals, daily goals. Like I won't fap today, one day at a time).   Jesus Christ I hope this isn't a real thing.     	121
       Drake had a song at the ESPYs - Side Pieces for girls like her               Heres another one:    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy4ei1y5Fzk   at 2:10   Thats even worse.   disrespect isn't trivial    Yuuuuuuup.    Maybe Bronson should learn to watch what he says.       What AB did was immature, lame, and unnecessary.   See how that works?   She's talented. But unstable, i'll concede.    If you seriously think GFK would have killed him, rap music isn't for you.      Why would he respond any other way than to just say sorry and get on living his awesome life? Why would he further antagonize an old ass dude who is clearly a hothead and is/was involved in very real crimes and likely murders?  GFK called him to clear up the situation, and AB posted some half-assed tweets ...then deleted them.  That was the last straw for GFK.   AB brought it on himself. Many years ago, even saying what AB said would get hands laid on you. Not saying I disagree, but this is VERY serious. This is how GFK eats. GFK basically made it possible for people to even listen to AB's music.   AB should have known he was playing with fire and he chose to pretend like he could boss up in front of the cameras and it didnt work.   If AB was really about that life, he wouldn't have apologized.    I really want to call you an out of touch white boy who wouldn't last a day in the real jungle, but I won't do that so i'll get back to studying for my boards and making more than you and 99% of the nation's population.  But hey, whatever you need to remind yourself that you think you're "above petty rap beef" when in reality, you're a sheltered clown with no sense of cultural perspective or appreciation instead of trying to gain some sense of masculinity from a genre of music you innately have no connection to. You're a vulture and I can tell you're struggling to come up with a riposte.   You wouldn't tell me to "go die" in my face, so get real.    I call it cultural tourism. They enjoy hardcore music but can't imagine the source of some of the pain and anger that produces these songs they can merely induldge in recreationally.   GFK and the rest of the Wu are some of the most certified guys in the history of musical entertainment...we're talking FBI files and all of that.   And for AB to even think the SLIGHTEST degree of disrespect would go un-noticed lets us know that we've gotten to a point where people think they can disrespect LEGENDS in the game   Because its the old way? No.  Its merely the RIGHT way. I don't care if rappers get along. I enjoy it...but don't pretend like everything is supposed to slide off your back and go unchecked. Some things you say has consequences and you need to be prepared to deal with it.   But if you want to call it a "little jab" then you must understand how disrespectfully it will be received.   Its telling that you don't think AB should have kept his mouth shut anyways. But no, its GFKs fault for putting AB in his place.   He did an album with Adrian Younge too. Two of them. Both have been well received.  Again, you don't know anything about the culture, or rap music in general.     I have a masters degree and about to start school for a professional degree.  This is reddit...not my work office.  So yea, i'll talk to you anyway I please while you type away in your freshman dorm.  This culture is bigger than what some disrespectful out of touch home-body has to think  Go bump that Iggy and share it with Fantano    GFK treated AB like the child he was.  GFK is very sensitive to these things and AB should have accepted thats how things were gonna be since he wants to be a rapper.  Dudes were coming at Shyne and Gorilla Black for saying that they were biters. If you're going to come in the game sounding like someone else, you've got to understand how the dynamics are going to work against you      Respect the legends.  Go do the knowledge or fall back.  We don't respect your kind in this culture.    AB is so in the right...that he apologized profusely and begged forgiveness.   LMAO.  Only on reddit.    you're on HHH but don't understand the importance of respect in the culture.  Go home w...boy.     if you really thought GFK would kill AB you're an idiot.    Whats funny is how AB never gets criticized for even opening his mouth. The fact he apologized so profusely shows how right GFK was   Bronson is 31. He hasn't learned to shut his mouth?     It wasn't until The Eminem Show came out that i really grew to love hip hop.  On reddit, i'm not surprised.    The fact you made this theory shows you don't get it.  Bronson violated and apologized. Reneged. Got called out. then RE-apologized.  He KNOWS he was in the wrong    Ghost face released 2 critically acclaimed albums this year.  Go crawl back into your cul-de-sac  AB shouldn't have opened his mouth talking slick. Now he's crying about it on twitter. Suck it up. Be a man and stand behind your words.  The fact AB apologized ruins ANYTHING you're saying.    He responded in the same vein AB did.  I have no problem with what Ghostface said. He even CALLED the man and AB didn't back down.  AB shouldn't have opened his mouth. Where do you live in which there are no consequences?     AB was acting like a bitch when he decided to throw shots at the man that allows him to feed his children   You're on /r/outoftheloop...you sure you want to be here?   The entire WU has FBI files on the entire group's members.  You children really think its sweet out here on the street   Too bad.  AB's behavior after that also predicated this in deleting the apology he posted up   Your theory is ass.  GFK ain't messing with AB and to think this could be publicity shows you don't understand how respect works.    You're on /r/hiphopheads and really don't understand the subtlety of language now?   Really?  Is that the game we're playing?    Oh ok.   Just remember that people who really live that life won't tolerate some culture tourist "making jokes"   Too bad.      AB wasn't telling jokes. He was coming at the entire livelihood of another man who is single-handedly responsible for your career.  if AB didn't sound like GFK's legendary career AB would be flipping burgers   And lets be frank, the culture gap too  A lot of these kids really don't understand RESPECT   Funny how AB doesn't get the same criticism for talking crazy about the one man who made you famous   It was not. It was totally said in a disrespectful and dismissive way.   They love the cultural tourism of rap music but can't stomach the complications of accepting how REAL some of it is   no, just sheltered white kids  they love the tourism of violent music but can't embody the risks associated with it   GFK is in no way obligated to accept it   AB is on twitter legit crying right now too.   "they sent death threats...no!"     So why can't AB grow up?  Ya'll are too used to talking crazy and dodging consequences.   This new generation needed to be reminded how respect works   You shouldn't use some of those words. You're clearly not even black.   ...which is all GFK was trying to do   Reddit?   LETS GOOOOOOO!!!   Yeah..."certain" posters online keep reminding you how "out of touch" they are with this "element"   Reddit kinda has this subtle way of reminding you how white and out of touch they are.    Seems like you live in a world in which disrespect is tolerated.    Good.   you nerds online really keep thinking rap is some violent business.    GFK gave AB MANY...MANY chances   I'm ABSOLUTELY supporting what GFK is doing.  You can't keep letting disrespect slide. Before you know it, history is getting rewritten      This is hard      ...if he even knows any   I guess you prefer the Death Metal at the masquerade?    Because no one invests in heavy rail   How brave. Does that sarcasm serve you well in real life? Where people usually ignore you?   You can only push back on poor communities for so long...they can't go to the outskirts any more      He has 18 months. Chill out   what happens when you mess up?   its really not that complicated.  She's not going to start ramping things up until things get more serious.  Is a year and a half to go   only 2 days smh         I thought BMW was a pretty well engineered brand..   theres a few links in the article    **GERONIMO! KIA!**   I thought McCain snitched on his fellow soldiers      The Saudis are trying to save face now...            The truest vein of that Dungeon Family connection   Many charts are now incorporating plays and spins a la spotify etc.    its a 2 minute video...               WOW. Just. WOW   This album is INCREDIBLE.  He exceeded any expectation I had                        Eh...kinda it did.  Cuba being so close to the US has been hindered immensely. Its harder to work on the other side of the earth   The funny thing is that when Israel bombed Syria's nuclear facility, Syria apparently just took a few years off then tried to start up again allegedly  http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/evidence-points-to-syria-still-working-on-a-nuclear-weapon-a-1012209.html   I'm loving it.      Dont forget Iran and Azerbaijan  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam_in_Azerbaijan     confirmation helps   This is why Iran can't get a nuke...   A Q Khan should be sentenced to death   This is incredible. I just watched the Black Ops episode on this whole affair and it looks that Syria in the midst of everything is STILL building a nuke    Great. Now the Saudis want  a nuke      Nah, reddit says its not a race issue         Germany 20 years ago was a vassal state of communist racists.  Try again   they're building and importing bomb parts    REALPOLITIK    ALSO, its funny that when Assad found out that Suleiman had stolen like $80m, he got pissed and tried to found out how he got that corrupt   The Dubai assassination needs to be made into a movie      Sounds like you don't know anything about what Future is trying to do.  The streets will eat this up   wait what?         Streets are definitely empty in the summer   The only reason people live here   Time to invest in terrorism stocks!         One line? In the whole verse?  Thats essentially a fail.    I'm guessing you really don't get it, huh?  Its about that innate swagger and a sense of self respect and honor in the black community.  Its about being a classic, refined, reformed, eloquent gentleman.      ...that would mean he's not versatile...   he doesn't.  Its still too wordy.  he doesn't play with it as much as he should.   Look at Jay Z features for example...compared to...Nas.       Who do you think created those single family homes and high unemployment?  Red-lining and Jim Crowe was happening when your parents were kids. That doesn't just disappear.   Native Americans got reparations...guess who didn't.    As a black redditor I sometimes just give up and log off...I can't correct every 16 year old on the internet.    The white supremacists woke up I see   completely disagree      He's over-rapping. Every verse is the same stylistically...and frankly its fatiguing.    ...its really not this serious   ...its really not this serious         Crimea is nice all year round         its almost the type of argument a theist would make   I guess you also forgot where he DID try to do that initially. and still advocates for it now.   You white, breh?    the original was better. Kendrick doesn't know how to finesse features. Its really annoying.    Kendrick is terrible at doing features.       I want to remind people that party affiliation DOES matter.  No republican president would have ever done this   Obama with Senioritis really is the GOAT   Stuff seems to be burning: https://twitter.com/Breaking911/status/621389094011146240   Funded by BP   WOW   you can't just post a number a cut it    Oh, I forgot. Obama never even attempts to "fix" BIG issues like income inequality, he pecks at the edges because doing something bold just isn't on his agenda of "change".  you're just babbling, huh?                  fascinating.          we really had no choice.   Everyone has tried to sabotage every iranian nuclear plant using the most advanced computer viruses ever and kill as many scientists working on the plan as possible...AND used some of the most stringent economic sanctions to any planet ever.   And they've kept going            He's right. Its the best we could do.   Iran will probably have a nuke, but we have to try because theres no other option but war.       Fascism applies to internal politics.  And furthermore, I really don't care what you're trying to convince me of.  I support things that the US benefits from. We aren't helped with an arms race in the middle east      Its not facist and you can't keep using a word you clearly are misunderstood on what it means      Its not racism to hold your own nation's values over anyone else.                         I don't respect what any other nation thinks they want to do if it violates what we want them to do   Its how hegemony works.   You call it selfish, I call it maintaining power.    He can't do anything about it. Its either make a "deal" or kill millions of Iranians.    Iran is going to be the next Pakistan         sniffer?        	195

 Hey there readers!  I just read a great book and would love to email the author some questions. Even if its ignored... Is this possible?  I would want to contact Ron Chernow, author of Titan.  Thank you in advance, I appreciate all the answers :)   Wish I had a business. Otherwise I would. Good luck :)   Wow that's a very interesting business model you've got there!   LOL a good friend of mine is the daughter of the founder :p   What is the best alternative then? (If no coder friends or acquaintances are available).   I may be wrong. Unlike water,  bandwidth has a very large and beneficial use to society, a merit good with a large positive externality - unlike water (I am aware we need water to survive). The benefits vary from providing education, training,  entertainment, political accountability (at least in democratic nations), healthcare, increases long-run aggregate supply, allows for more perfect knowledge etc. Examples abound. Therefore, bandwidth, internet and similar other goods and services (such as Wikipedia), ought to be provided for free as their benefits far outweigh the costs.   Sorry I meant, others had so much hate on you. Very interesting article too. So what would you suggest retail investors do?   I feel like your having so much hate for no reason. What would one, in your opinion, do then? Should this prevent one from investing in Google? Are there other companies you could name that you feel have similar issues?   All the money raised by start-ups / number of people in country. A proxy to see how easy it is to gain capital (and thus how easy to succeed) in a given European country.   It is very expensive, your right. But I really do not understand why the perif is such a large chasm. Living in Paris it just seems like a large road. I woudknt understand how the prices of real estate in one side could be markedly higher than on the other.   I'm Parisian too and didn't know that. I thought it was a clear east v west divide   Permanently keep the Olympics would have numerous benefits to all parties currently involved in the negotiations. But what would it provide to the IOC? I fear that dictators are more lucrative.   Map of real estate prices in Paris. Source: http://www.plandeparis.info/immobilier/carte-prix-immobilier-paris.html      Thought you could    How would you re-negotiate?      I may be ignorant/wrong but I believe in my humble opinion that finance/accounting/bookkeeping is the only real tangible thing one can learn to prepare for business - everything else being learnt through experience. I also believe it is the bedrock of all other departments (marketing, hr, production) and that by learning it first it would help in the long run (not that I didn't learn about marketing either).   Hey! I am a pre-university (IB) student 17 years old) living in Paris. I would want to apply to UCL, LSE and/or Oxford and I would want to have some work experience. I already am doing a 3 week internship this summer, as well as read up on a lot of material. Just as John D. Rockefeller began almost two hundred years ago, finance and numbers is something that I appreciate and having some bookkeeper experience is something I will value greatly. I understand that I would only be of limited use, but I would love it if you could give me a chance.  Here are reasons why I may interest any of you:  I do not require any pay at all  I have free time  I consider myself very knowledgeable (albeit inexperienced) for my age*  I have a good grasp on Microsoft Excel, Access and other software  I have satisfactory grades:  near perfect IGCSEs (including ICT HL, Business HL and maths HL) 40 in IB (according to latest report) (including Math SL and Economics HL)  I am willing and able to provide more information as well as evidence that I actually can/did these things.  I would want to participate in accounting, finance, etc. for any of your firms. PM me for further details if you wish so. I hope I am not sounding too pretentious or arrogant, I am just excited at the prospect of working with entrepreneurs, craving to be one one day.   PS. I will only work for an actual start-up and/or SME. It will have to be online as I am not able to move away from Paris.  *I have already began investing in the stock market after reading both the II and SA, as well as 'Titan: Rockefeller' and many other books; I have pursued small entrepreneurial ventures and have already worked in a couple of events organising several things. However, I overall lack the experience that you may require of me, and I am willing to compensate by working hard and learning fast, without pay.      Hey r/entrepreneur!

Here are reasons why I may interest any of you:  I do not require any pay at all  I have free time  I consider myself very knowledgeable (albeit inexperienced) for my age*  I have a good grasp on Microsoft Excel, Access and other software  I have satisfactory grades:  near perfect IGCSEs (including ICT HL, Business HL and maths HL) 40 in IB (according to latest report) (including Math SL and Economics HL)  I am willing and able to provide more information as well as evidence that I actually can/did these things.  I would want to participate in accounting, finance, etc. for any of your firms. PM me for further details if you wish so. I hope I am not sounding too pretentious or arrogant, I am just excited at the prospect of working with entrepreneurs, craving to be one one day.   *I have already began investing in the stock market after reading both the II and SA, as well as 'Titan: Rockefeller' and many other books; I have pursued small entrepreneurial ventures and have already worked in a couple of events organising several things. However, I overall lack the experience that you may require of me, and I am willing to compensate by working hard and learning fast, without pay.   And they are running out of time   A very utopian and unrealistic idea, but what about: a nation where a majority of people are shareholders of companies that use robots. Incomes of most people would derive from capital gains and dividends, whilst a minority gain their income from managerial roles (CEOs, politicians, non-profits, military, etc). I've thought about it, but being 17, I would love to have this idea challenged.   Will soon be 29 states :p   I just hope European companies actually try to increase efficiency instead of relying too much on subsidies. I would want to see European spacex's instead of ariane's.   Thanks for the response :D Why do you think fiscal policy would not work/be effective?         Hey r/economy! My first post.  You all probably know a lot about this topic, so lets discuss! Mini-essays, links or discussions would be much more interesting than simple responses - but I wish this thread interests everyone.  Discuss!   Strange :D   Lad :D  How did he do?   Thank you for the answer :) is there anything I should tell them specifically? Its a tiny snack sandwhich shop, so I doubt they got annual reports :D   Thanks for the answer :) Any tips or advice on how to frame the question? I guess I would want help in the details.  	33

Works great when grooming the fur balls.               It happened in 1990. Procedures for such injuries, especially for kids, was not yet practiced; at least not in the US.            I was hit by a car when I was three-and-a-half and dragged 20-ft down a dirt road.   Students I taught this past school year were born in 2000.   9 years ago I was a freshman in college.   Damn I feel old.      http://www.cddo.cwood.org/resources/pages/autism.htm               His wife, not daughter.  Maybe they'll start selling some of the food at the Hookah House.                     Most episodes take place in California, but why is this? I understand that the studio is located in San Francisco, but why not expand out and record episodes elsewhere? There are a wide-range of myths scattered about the U.S. in relation to a specific area and it would make the story that much more interesting if the myth could be proven or debunked in the exact location where it was said to have taken place.   edit: typo         The State of Texas is the new Germany in regards to the denial of history.   I see it more as everyone else fit in with the Amish. That is, before they stayed back in time and everyone else moved forward.   Pros: knowing that you're changing to something that works.  Cons: complete utter hell. I spent a few weeks gradually weaning off of Cymbalta, even though my doctor was against it. I wanted to change medications and it was my only option. I experienced horrible mood swings, I would want to scream and throw things (I had a tendency of doing this before taking antidepressants), my body felt numb, I couldn't eat, all I wanted to do was sleep, and is something I hope I never have to go through again.   This may not be the same thing experienced by other people, but weaning of an antidepressant such as Cymbalta has it's downsides. BUT it is definitely worth it if you are changing to something that works.  I am currently on a medication that works and doesn't interfere with my anxiety meds.   I hate people who constantly refer to themselves in the third person.    Someone needs to tie her up, put her in a box, tape it shut, and leave it at the side of the road.      Everyone outside of the US is a commy pussy?          Step #1. Work hard and get accepted into Stanford with an acceptance rate of 5.1%.  Step #2. Free education      Thanks!      How much time should I allow? I have class at 8am.         Should I buy a K10 Connector permit or ride the bus anyway?  I have a morning and afternoon class scheduled on Monday and Wednesday and am trying to decide if riding a bus for over an hour is really worth it.

I would just like to put it out there that they know we expect an attack on the 4th..meaning that they'll want to hit us off-guard and NOT attack on the 4th. Especially if they know we are prepared.  Also, enough with the scare tactics. People are paranoid as is, try not to make it worse. Best thing to do would be to not publicize what the FBI plans to do and just do it.

One of my students thought it was a cool idea and decided to do the same thing. I mentioned that it was in support of the LGBT community and she immediately removed it.    I'd rather know. It took me a few years while in college to realize that most of my 'friends' didn't like me and chose to be my friend out of sympathy. By that time I didn't really care anymore. Today I have two real friends and that's all I need.             During Skepticon in Springfield, MO a few years back, attendees were banned from eating at a few local restaurants due to their beliefs, or lack there of.  Luckily it didn't last long. Pictures were everywhere online once signs were put up in the windows.   Donation people!!!!! I always donate my books to the public library. Last year I ended up with a near $200 tax write-off.   Of dick. Under his desk.  :-O ----===8   Wichita?  I came off as a racist and homophobic person until I moved away to college. It was how I was raised and I didn't know any better. Once I got out of that fucking place and entered the real world, I came to the realization of just how close minded everyone was.            Too bad he doesn't have grass to lay on.....            There is when you're hiding the smell of weed.  I worked at a high school and you knew who had been smoking during school. The hallways reeked of cologne after lunch.   Starting next school year, the school will be allowed to randomly drug test students. That ought to be fun, except for the students I knew who used drugs (EDBD students). They already have it bad in life.          First name - WKRP in Cincinnati  Middle name - in honor of my half-sister who died from cancer a few years before I was born  Last name - the father figure who adopted us because our biological father wouldn't allow us to legally have his ~~name~~ surname.

Lawrence.com               The class was at a high school level.         /r/oddlysatisfying   I would steer clear. You are forced to pay a lot of money. If you have beliefs that do not match those of others in the house, then expect one hell of a good time. Also, you pay for fake friends.  If you are joining a sorority, they CHOOSE YOU, you do not choose them. So even if you want to be KD, ADPi, DG, etc. it really isn't up to you.                  I have lived in two of the counties and they are both on KS.      I have a lot I need to do today but I don't want to ruin this moment by waking him up.       In case there is a pay wall,  The Senate joined the House by approving a session-ending bill Friday making adjustments to legislation imposing a state tax increase of $432 million next year that constitutes the largest in Kansas history.  Public begging and private bullying that defined the session's votes on tax policy prompted adoption by the bare minimum -- 21 votes in the Senate, 63 in the House -- of legislation  endorsed by Gov. Sam Brownback and designed to respond to a projected $400 million deficit in the fiscal year starting July 1.  The House came up with a slightly different mix of tax additions than was passed Sunday by the Senate, which required the upper chamber to vote on a bill matching the House action. That bill was in peril on Friday afternoon until Sen. Rob Olson, R-Olathe, changed his vote to "yes" and provided the ending margin.  In recent days, heavy political muscle was applied to GOP lawmakers to vote for a tax increase or face a primary election opponent in August 2016.  The Brownback administration also triggered a public backlash by declaring failure to raise taxes could result in sweeping budget reductions in Kansas higher education.  The battle to frame the tax increase in a politically palatable way erupted on the Senate and House floors.  "I view this as tax reform, not a tax hike," said Sen. Julia Lynn, an Olathe Republican who voted for the measure.  Sen. Jeff Longbine, R-Emporia, said the tax package was deficient in many ways but voted for the legislation because it might not improve if the session was prolonged. He denounced tactics used to persuade legislators to vote for revenue enhancements.  "We've had blackmail from the executive branch to the legislative branch," he said. "We've had blackmail within this body."  Brownback, in a meeting Thursday with Republicans in the House and Senate, said he was desperate to make a deal.  "I'm pleading with you, really," he said.  That GOP gathering helped inspire passage by the House of a two bills revising tax law, but likely requiring Brownback to take a knife to state spending in the next fiscal year. The chamber slipped over the hurdle around 4 a.m. Friday after hard-core conservatives who had stiff-armed leadership and the governor for weeks folded.  "Colleagues, weve had a long session, but our diligence has paid off and were making an additional $50 million in cuts to the budget," said Rep. Steve Brunk, R-Wichita. "Our goal is to enact a long-term stable and predictable revenue source to provide necessary services while protecting taxpayers pocketbooks. This bill accomplishes that.  Though dozens of Republicans ended up voting to raises taxes -- some in violation of anti-tax pledges -- some couldn't hide their displeasure.  Rep. John Whitmer, a Wichita Republican, spoke through tears as he explained his "yes" vote.  "I voted for something I am not proud of," Whitmer said, "but I feel it's what the folks need."  The legislation retained a business tax exemption Brownback delivered to 330,000 businesses in 2012, but raised the statewide sales tax to 6.5 percent from 6.15 percent on all purchases. A provision dropping the sales tax on food to 5.95  percent was withdrawn by Republicans who want to consider that adjustment in advance of the 2016 elections for House and Senate.  "It gives us the highest sales tax rate on food in the nation. Low-income people will be paying the highest rate in the nation," said Senate Minority Leader Anthony Hensley, D-Topeka. "Brownback's tax policy is Robin Hood in reverse. He steals from the poor to benefit the rich."  House Minority Leader Tom Burroughs, D-Kansas City, said Republicans were dedicated to adding $164 million to the sales tax, wiping out $97 million in itemized deductions and boosting the cigarette tax by $40 million.  "We are literally increasing the cost of living in Kansas on those who can afford it least," Burroughs said.  The plan would freeze state income tax rates at 2.7 percent and 4.6 percent through 2017, which saves the state $26  million. The deal also dropped language requiring all Kansas sales tax exemptions to expire in four years.  The session has consumed 113 days -- longest in state history and well beyond the standard 90-day session.  The break in House gridlock followed warnings by the Brownback administration that savage cuts would be made in the state university system and the state's bond ratings would collapse absent a compromise about Republicans.  Brownback and the GOP-controlled House and Senate struggled to respond to a budget deficit that trailed approval of the elimination of state income tax on limited liability companies and other businesses as well as the reduction of individual income tax rates. The bill contains a $24 million hit on these business entities, but the presumption is savvy accountants could help most owners avoid the hit.  The higher sales tax would be implemented July 1, but businesses wouldn't be obligated to assess that rate for 30 days. That could clip the state for one month of the projected revenue increase from the sales tax by $13 million.  The legislation also depends on the Kansas Department of Revenue pulling in $30 million this fall with a tax amnesty program for people who have dodge taxes.  The two bills now in play with the House and Senate would raise $384.6 million annually for the state, but a separate piece of legislation sent to Brownback would deliver $47.8 million from a new tax on managed care organizations in Kansas.

I know Petminders offers pet sitting, but I would rather not have someone I do not know in my home during that time.       From personal experience, even if it is a person, they're likely not to stop.     	115
 Night Film by Marissa Pessl is a must read. Well, specifically if you are also a fan of cinema.    Yes, I knew 48 hours before pir   For some reason scenes from "The Painter" by Peter Heller always come to my mind. I'll be driving or something and I'll just think back on this book. I've read dozens of books after it, most were more memorable, yet I still think back on it. It's a good book, don't get me wrong but it shouldn't have stuck with me.    How bout yall?      I feel that it will be an extremely lose adaption. Especially if they're going for a trilogy.   2040 looks right too me   I really wanted to be a Loadmaster :(    Nice link. Sister just started a PR internship, shed read this.   If you're in it for a high salary, military ain't the right place. Look at officers salaries, they aren't that competitive to real world STEM jobs. Plus, dont you basically need a STEM degree to get commissioned?   Doesn't look even close to worth it.   I think its an editing joke   Doesn't even matter. The more people that watch Chappelles stand up, the better the world will be    Nice post yo.   Its a horror film   Its about Sofia Vergara and Reese Witherspoon competing to see who could be the most annoying.   Winter Soldier is better, in my opinion at least. GotG had a really really shitty villain. Sure, the buildup was great, but the point of there union was shitty. Who was even the villain? I dont remember.   I cant decide between them two   I own this and I love it   Season 2 needs to happen already   It is too weird. I dont see it connecting with most people.    Thanks everyone, just gonna study at the hotel and airplane ride.   Im going in E3 so yea, ill just learn the orders.   How about ranks? Is it really necessary to memorize those before going in? I think I know the sailor creed already, DEP meeting singing put it in my mind.   Haven't opened my START book because I would rather just learn all of it at Great Lakes. Am I right in thinking that I can go unprepared and still succeed? I mean, I'll study on the plane I guess. Just don't want to spend my last days as a civilian studying.   My prediction: opening dom $35 million   final $105 million  international i have no idea   Sounds like she has mental problems. Hopefully she gets help   Yea I was really really wrong   You might as well mention it. I luckily had a doctor perform a pulmonary function test on me a couple years ago that I passed perfectly, so I just had to bring that proof in, but I'm all good.   This is some saiyan shit. Come to the brink of death, survive, find yourself more powerful than ever before.   The movie cant be seen live, but the fight is better if watched live. makes sense that many took a gamble on it.   I loved it.    I cant decide between Sirens of Titan and Cats Cradle   There were also a lot of college graduations going on. This was an eventful weekend. I missed the fight and the clippers game just to watch Avengers. My priorities are different lol   I say you're correct. $135 mill opening with only 30% drop   That guy must be so happy he supported his wife's hobby    Why don't you just ask daddy to buy you some money?   Anectodal evidence of course, but I left my theater today at around 12:30 am and streets were empty. I hung out at my friends house for a bit and on the way home there was a lot more cars, around 2 am, so a lot of people were watching this fight. Movie was awesome btw. The reviews made me lower my expectations, and I wasn't blown away, but it was a great 2.5 hours. Better than furious 7   So should movies just have blank spaces in spots where brands would normally appear? Honestly how is complaining about product placement still a thing. I hold a Nokia phone in my hand and Scott toilet paper behind me. If I was in a film these would be visibly present, yet not integral to the storyline. They're just there. Dont worry about it.   OP listen to this.   Also OP, do you qualify for a Top Secret clearance?   My predicitons are pretty close to yours. Good analysis.  Only three I would change, Minions, Ted and Inside Out. I think you overestimate Minions and Inside Out. Ted 2 I can see hitting $200.   And yea, Mad Max is gonna crawl to $100 slower than Edge of Tomorrow.     I regret not going immediately after high school.  Questions: Can you afford college?  Do you care if you arent an officer?  How bad do you want to leave your current hometown?  What job would you like in the military?  What degree would you persue in college?  Do you know about the GI Bill?   America post cynicism    That novel is literary vacation.   The Stand by Stephen King is similar in that it deals with multiple parts of an apocalypse.   So about the same as the first one. Yall that were saying $300 mil were fucking crazy   Yea ill ask there thank you. I usually frequent those subreddits anyways.   If its good: Yay!   If its bad: I dont care!   Book will always be the same. A great short thrill to read    Honestly feel like cancelling on my friend :/ we were gonna watch Avengers 2 sat before the fight. Now I have a game 7 to watch   what to ddooooo   I'd settle for just being a billionaire honestly   That  southern lovin   I wish I was him.   Watch WrestleMania. It was great   Going to Navy bootcamp in May, and I want Bernie as my future president. Last election I wasnt much involved but I feel like it will be necessary this time. I will most likely not be stationed in my home state of Florida, so I will be a mail in. Do primaries allow mail in? Am I even allowed to participate in a campaign while on active duty?   Thank you   Ive read three from King, got a couple of his i still want to read. Adding it   Whats there to catch up on? The good guys are good and the bad guys are bad.   theres a new star wars?!!?!?   I was soooo wrong on this one. It looked like a bomb to me. Second trailers did help a lot.   My advice, talk to a recruiter as soon as possible. I signed my contract seven months ago and I still have a couple weeks left to ship. Its a process.   I've had that on my list for a while   That sounds interesting, title?   La Sombra del Viento has me in mid 20 century Spain.  Blood Meridian has me in mid 19th century Tex/Mex.  I would much rather be in Spain though.  So, where do your books have you? Space? A labyrinth?  Why's no one posting titles?    I say $210 million. Those presales are surprising me.  	62

 This summer I was given a summer reading list for my 9th grade Honors English class.I looked through the list and picked out Uncle Toms cabin.I've started reading it but haven't been able to get into the book.I don't know if its just what happens with most books where the begining starts out slow or is it just the time of when I am reading it and the reason why I am reading it ? Has anyone else experienced this ? Thanks   US women's team vs China's Womens team    If anyone has beard of the game Club Penguin you may also agree how funny this could be.

 But they're absolutely necessary. Death is permanent so it's damn important that we get it right.    I thought that it was confirmed that Otis Toole killed him  The official conclusion is that Toole killed him.   Plus Dahmer made a full confession, why else would he admit to the 1978 murder of Steven Hicks when he could have gotten away with, why admit that but leave Adam Walsh out?   Also, Dahmer was obsessed with heads and skulls, discarding the head is not like him. Neither is preying on children. I've read about this theory more than a dozen times. I don't think it's likely.      What's wrong about it? It's tissue that would otherwise be destroyed. There's no rational argument for not using it for the advancement of scientific medical knowledge and the good of mankind.   You don't speak for everyone.    Hence the quotation marks.    That's what I was thinking. What's the difference between this and brass knuckles? The summary in the link described it as "nonlethal".    Nah. This kind of stuff can happen almost anywhere. I wouldn't be surprised to have read that this happened in Missouri, Arkansas, Illinois, Mississippi, Florida, Virginia, California, Utah, or any other state really.    Yeah, I tried again. Still got a paywall.   Edit: It's also worth noting that this article is more than two years old.    I wonder what kind of resolution the device offers.    This is horrible manners in Japan too.    Any idea about the legal status of such devices?    I don't care about reposts* so much, but it's obnoxious when people repost and try to make up some crummy story to claim ownership.    So she's incompetent because you disagree with her?    Paywall    Thanks for clarifying. Have a nice life.    I was in the Navy so I'm well acquainted with that testing. Though I wouldn't suggest risking it, I'm not convinced that they test for [Psilocin unless it's indicated.] (https://www.erowid.org/plants/mushrooms/mushrooms_testing.shtml)   There are plenty of employment positions where drug testing is non-negotiable. The supervisor may not have a say at all. But I seriously doubt that they're actively testing for Psilocybin or any of its metabolites.    I don't know. It's unfortunate that the parents have had to suffer through all of this. But that photo presents a solid warning about the consequences of reckless driving.    You called me an "avowed, violent homophobe". I'm none of these things, and certainly not "avowed"   You were arguing that people of color are more likely to commit crimes because of their race.   I didn't say you were a nazi. I said that you would support interning and deporting foreigners, and would most likely borrow a page from Hitler's book. I'm not wrong. You obviously believe that Africans are inferior human beings. One only has to flip through your comment history to see that. If you don't like being associated with hateful organizations, stop spreading hateful rhetoric and ideas.    Overly dramatic? Maybe. Incompetent? On what basis do you claim that she's incompetent?    Too bad this is a repost.    That picture is terrible and the text is unreadable.    Boone's Farm is not wine.    No, their job does not test for mushrooms.    I'll take her over either of those two Republicans.    [This is the image in question. (NSFW)] (http://imgur.com/7kV4hmd)   [Here is a picture of her. ] (http://imgur.com/Ih3Ji1o)    Apparently you didn't read my comment. She was already a senator. She was the incumbent. She beat both Talent and Akin fair and square.    Doesn't look like it's any bigger than a mosquito to me.    Of course drinking and driving is wrong and there should be penalties for breaking this law. But most of the country is either rural or suburban. There's no question that people all over the place are either pushing the legal boundaries or breaking the law because it's either terribly inconvenient or even impossible for them to go out without driving themselves. I'm not defending their actions. I'm merely explaining the problem. Until we acknowledge that there is a problem, we cannot address it, let alone solve it.   If we as a nation committed to building mass transportation infrastructure, we could solve this problem and many more.    Are you calling me a homophobe?   You're calling me a "violent homophobe"? Are you for real?    When employees don't earn enough from their labor to break even that is a form of slavery.    I don't disagree. But here we are in a thread discussing raising the minimum wage til our heads fall off while getting nowhere year after year. I'm completely for a basic income, but we can't even convince people that workers have a right to not live in poverty. How the hell do you expect to convince the same people that no one deserves to live in poverty, ever?    That doesn't make any sense.    What? Blagojevich isn't running for anything. He's in prison and completely unelectable.    The US is not an empire. It's a country. There's no reason to compare it with any of the empires that you listed. It's not like the US is an occupying force controlling multiple individual populations like those places.    That's not necessarily true. Obviously the powers of the executive are checked and balanced by the powers of the judicial and legislative branches, but that doesn't mean that a president cannot facilitate change or resist change.    Meanwhile, a third of the food that's produced in the US is thrown away or destroyed. There's absolutely no reason why anyone should go hungry in this country, especially not children.             Like I said, you're a terrible person.    He was threatened with a 40 year sentence for $40 worth of cannabis. How does that not constitute coercion under severe distress?    Fucking monsters. We need to get more on this story.    Goddamn, you're a terrible person.       You're being downvoted for being wrong. Did you even read the article that you linked?    That's ridiculous. Yeah there were atrocities committed against the Native Americans, but otherwise there's no comparison.       Jesus, really? You just called me lazy for providing your sources for you?   I was just joshing ya. You can tell that my comment was meant to be a joke (and not a personal attack) from the lack of profanity and personal insults. I was joking. No harm, no foul?    Make an amazingly relevant point and don't provide a source.... What's wrong with you? Did you not have five minutes to spend with Google?   Well here it goes:  From last year: [According to a CBS News investigation, at least 12 of the top leaders of ISIS served time at Camp Bucca, including the man who would become the group's leader, Abu Bakr al Baghdadi.] (http://www.cbsnews.com/news/the-origins-of-isis-finding-the-birthplace-of-jihad/)   [Camp Bucca.] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camp_Bucca)   Shame on you. Some people are dying for the opportunity to Google stuff.    Aww, did this repost huwt yorw feewings?    Is he a genius? Is that the word? Really? I mean seriously? Genius?    Exactly. Star Wars is a great analog for the current US economy. "Of course it didn't make you any profit, that money is mine.".   What's your point? And you didn't answer: which of those labels are you for not even offering anyone anything for their labor? Other employers might not be making them offers that you like, but you're not offering them anything at all. Should you really be on your high horse?  I don't assume to have the right to steal other people's time and labor, two things that have a definite value and cannot be replaced.    What are the basic necessities of life, and why do they cost 150 times what they did 200 years ago?  Basic food, shelter, communication, and transportation. Why the fuck would we be assessing our current cost of living based upon standards that are two hundred years old?   By what metric? Obviously not by what it takes to survive.  Survival? Can a family survive without working in this country? Please include sources and/or examples.   I doubt that's a choice many would make. There are far better alternatives, even to people who are vastly poorer than the poorest people in our society.  Again your argument is "it could be worse. You could have been born 5,000 years ago." That makes no sense at all. It's now that I refer you to the history of the US from the late 19th century up until the end of WWII. Please explain to me why workers aren't entitled to a reasonable share of the fruits of their labor.   Anyone who advocates a minimum wage.  Banning people from working or prohibiting employers from exploiting people? See, I believe that there is at least a baseline value to human time and effort. You feel that human beings are worthless and should be exploited at every opportunity.   I said nothing of the sort. If you want to help them avoid living in squalor, help them become productive enough that they can convince an employer to pay them enough that they can afford better.   This is a good point. We should all have the right to convince employers that our time and effort is* worth more. I prefer the collective approach of negotiating. That's how employers negotiate wages; collectively. They collude with their competition and set wages at a baseline. What's wrong with employees doing the same thing? Why shouldn't there be a baseline to the value of human time and effort? What price do you put on your time with your children? What would you do to spend more time with them?   Which?  You'd have to be blind to have missed it. It's the edit at the bottom of the comment.      Assuming you're not an employer, which of those are you for not even offering them *anything* in compensation for their labor?  Every company I've worked for have been wage thieves. I've worked for people who have bounced my paychecks. Now years later they still have not faced the consequences of their actions. If I bounce one check I will either pay for it or I'll go to jail. In many cases I'll go to jail whether I pay it or not.    You can miss the point if you'd like, but it's quite obvious I'm not suggesting that. I'm asking why a 'living wage' has gone up 150 times. I can certainly understand it costs more money to live the sort of lifestyle people are accustomed to today.  A person earning minimum wage cannot afford the basic necessities of life in today's society.   So you're willing to admit that a 'living wage' is no such thing?  Fuck no! I feel that $15 is just about right with an increase to $17 by 2020.   Maybe we should let the poor decide what type of roof they'd like to have over their heads, rather than forcing them to pay for the same quality of roof as rich people like to pay for. Or if you think they deserve better, help them pay for it. Don't ban them from working because they can't convince an employer to pay them enough to buy such a roof.  And by letting poor people decide, you mean "allow them to choose to live outdoors". Who's talking about banning anyone from working?   There are plenty of people who survive, by choice, without electricity. Their interaction with the rest of society is limited, but they do fine. If you'd like to help people participate more thoroughly with society, or feel it's their right to do so, then help them to gain the skills they need to convince an employer to pay them enough to participate effectively in society. How does banning them from working help with that? Either way, you're no longer talking about a 'living wage'.  And there you have it. You think that people should be living in squalor and should only be able to cover their life expenses if they meet your arbitrary criteria. Again, who said anything about banning them from working?   Why didn't you answer my questions at the end of my comment?      OP decided for their own reasons to delete their comment but allowed me to quote them:  You got it.   Abortion was and still is the primary issue the religious right used to take over the Republican Party, using lies and deceit. The issue has always been other people's morality, and control.   I'll delete this shortly, TMI, but there is a young woman who exists today from an unwanted and unplanned pregnancy, whom I love very much. Her parents made what IMO was the right decision. Difficult, but manageable. The extended family had the resources to make it work.   Others don't. Poor women die from coat hanger or chemical abortions. Or they continue the cycle of poverty. No help for them from the religious right.      Nope, there's never any actual concern. This is about personal judgement. Thanks for sharing. I'd prefer that every child conceived had the opportunity to be born into a loving and welcoming environment. In "my perfect world", no one would ever get pregnant unless they wanted to or were at least ready to handle being a parent. Every child would be born into a loving home, and not one child would go without a single basic necessity. But we all know that's not the current situation. Rather than continuing on this hateful course, we should try working together to actually address these problems. These problems are solvable, no matter what the far-right has to say.    If no one will offer you a job that pays for food and shelter, what you need is charity or lower prices, not to be banned from working by a minimum wage law.   Working people do not need charity. They need compensation. This is simple. Those who do, need not ask for help. They earn their keep. It's not their fault that the bosses are lazy, greedy, and treacherous.    [It has been estimated that throughout prehistory, the world average GDP per capita was about $158 per annum (adjusted to 2013 dollars), and did not rise much until the Industrial Revolution.[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_history_of_the_world) That makes a 'living wage' today roughly 150 *times* the 'living wage' of 99% of all humans that have ever lived. Why the increase?   "You're absolutely correct. Americans should be living the lifestyle of the 19th century. The bosses shouldn't have to share the fruits of their workers' labor. Thats crazy talk. We should all live in huts, eat beans and rice for every meal, and be thankful for the opportunity. After all, we can't all be born into wealth. Just do what the master says, children."    What about the federal minimum wage in 5000 BC, or 1900 AD? People were still living then, last I checked.  Bwahaha! You're right. We should all be living in mud huts. Because fuck people, amirite?   If it costs 150 times more just to live, I would guess that expenses have increased.  Right, only the wealthiest people should have a solid roof over their heads. Who cares if it's impossible to function in today's society without electricity? Who cares if 90% of job opportunities are only available online. The internet should only be available to the most privileged. Who cares if a person needs to have clean cloths to remain employed? Laundry machines are a privilege for the wealthy.   What about the wealthy? What are the historical numbers on them? What are the historical numbers on wealth distribution?  How does it smell with your nose wedged so far up there?   Edit: Let me ask you something. What determines the cost of coal? Is it what the market will bear? Or is it the cost of extracting, handling, and shipping coal and then maintaining all of that overhead?      Thank you for your simple honesty. Seriously. I myself could never go through with an abortion unless my wife's life was in danger. I'm a father and I could never live with myself. But, I don't pretend to have the right to tell others what they can and cannot do with their own bodies. That attitude is just wrong.   But you're absolutely correct. Banning abortion doesn't stop abortion. It just drives it into back alleys and into the hands of criminals.   But the "prolife" people were never concerned with reducing abortions. Their goal is control over the personal choices of others. It's an obvious fact fhat the best way to reduce the number of abortions performed is to reduce the rate of unwanted pregnancy. The most effective method of doing that is through sex education and easy access to contraception, which those that you mentioned oppose. This was never about abortion. This "issue"  has always been about controlling the behavior and choices of women.    Nope. I think they were just pilots and aircrew. If we had continued our ground campaign against the Japanese the death toll would have been in the millions.   Now, don't get me wrong. I'm not entirely convinced that the bombings or their strategic placement were entirely necessary. Though I do understand the rationale behind forcing a full surrender that included the emperor stepping down and declaring himself a mortal man. You have to remember the numbers of people who were murdered by the Japanese military **by hand**. If any one of the axis members had acquired atomic weapons technology before  the US, they would have used it without a shred of discretion.    Or...  This is the thing... you'll love it...   Walmart knows that people are desperate and will work for anything they can get. They use government programs to offset their labor costs. They don't give a flying fuck about their employees, and when technologies become available for them to automate **every aspect** of their business they will.   Obama tried that and was blocked but if I were an illegal I would not have gone for his plan either. It is a very big humanitarian issue.    So simple food, shelter, transportation, and communication are too much to ask for when you work for a living? Why are expenses so much higher? What are you talking about? You understand that the federal minimum wage is well below what it was in the 1960's right? Did expenses increase or did wages stagnate and even decrease for most folks?    A Chicago investigator who determined that several civilian shootings by police officers were unjustified was fired after resisting orders to reverse those findings...   See, this is the problem. A real investigator does not receive or heed orders from the subject of his investigation. This is doubly true for an "independent investigator".   Daviss termination came less than two weeks after top IPRA officials, evaluating Daviss job performance, accused him of a clear bias against the police and called him the only supervisor at IPRA who resists making requested changes as directed by management in order to reflect the correct finding with respect to OIS, as officer-involved shootings are known in the agency.  IPRA? That's the **Independent** Police Review Authority. That's right, supervising investigator Lorenzo Davis, 65, a former Chicago police commander who served the CPD for twenty-three years was terminated because he refused to change his report so that it would be in agreement with the findings of his superiors.   The performance evaluation covered 19 months and concluded that Davis displays a complete lack of objectivity combined with a clear bias against the police in spite of his own lengthy police career.  "How dare he question the actions of the police? And him a former officer himself, no less. Well I never!" w  Apparently city management isn't even willing to listen to objective criticisms of its police departments even when it's coming from a former officer.   If there are a few bad police officers who have committed some shootings that are unnecessary or bad then it erodes the publics confidence in all the other police officers out there, Davis said.  Can you believe this guy? Who does he think he is attacking the police like that, an official supervising investigator charged with investigating police misconduct? How can the police do their jobs in such a hostile environment?     Jesus, that's disgusting. Thanks for the link.    Women, who are very rarely actual combatants have historically been the primary victims in war. It's not that difficult to understand. Men with guns invade your country, target you and your family members, rape and kill you and your loved ones. Or, your husband and reasonably mature sons are being sent away to die leaving you to fend for your family alone.    Yep. But I think this asshole would like to create a new one on American soil.    Slave level wages is an oxymoron.    Is it? If a person works forty hours a week and their wages don't even cover their living expenses, what do you call that? When workers have to go into debt in order to keep working, what do you call that?   The cost of living isn't tied to the minimum wage. It's likely that raising the minimum wage may cause a slight increase in inflation, but not enough to prohibit the move. Right now the economy that you're talking about is propped up by government programs and taxpayers' funds. A business that can't operate while treating it's employees with simple human dignity and adequately compensating them for their time in a way that is sustainable doesn't need to exist. This isn't the 19th century.     Both Mcdonald's and Walmart instruct their employees about what government assistance programs are available to them. This is pretty much common knowledge amongst those that are interested in politics.    Exactly. It's a studious Republican governor that orders the ban of something that's never once happened and is already very illegal.             I don't disagree with any of what you just said. But don't hate on the president for trying. The legislature sure as hell isn't going to do a damn thing.    Supported or did business with? Whether you see the distinction is irrelevant. Yes those companies all did business with the third reich. It's laughable that you don't realize that this is common knowledge to those with any understanding of history. It still doesn't excuse your shitty attitude toward those who have served and fought in the military.   Obviously it's a huge problem that corporations and states exploit any workers. But, why shit on any of them? You're no better than they. Your politics are almost admirable, but your attitude toward your fellow man is shit.   Edit: Added a question mark.    The majority have not been Mexican for awhile now. I never said the law was unjust. What's unjust is this attitude that nothing can be done to accommodate those that are already here. Why should people in Detroit flee to Canada? They're already in a relatively stable developed country. The most wealthy in the world in fact.    I asked for mudslinging, not quiet dismissal.    And who was that?   Edit: Because I think you're a bit confused. Claire McCaskill became a US senator when she defeated Republican incumbent Jim Talent in 2006. The person you're talking about, Todd Akin was the unsuccessful Republican challenger of 2012. She won the Senate seat and retained it because she was the better candidate on both instances.    I guess you think that all of the undocumented immigrants coming to the US are Mexican. And tell me what would you do if you found your family in that situation? Would you wait around for your sons to be recruited by gangs and your daughters turned out on the streets? Can you blame anyone for trying to escape that fate?    I don't disagree.    Yeah, that's a bullshit flag, and the mods won't respond to defend or even explain it.    I'm pointing out the blatant fact that War is not something to admire. And that those who lost their lives are not heroes. They are victims of state propaganda. Just like you and every other muppet who blindly buys the bollocks you're espousing.     Try telling that to the people of Europe and Asia after WWII. Explain to them why it was a mistake for the allies to confront the Nazis, Japanese and other axis members because doing so would just be statism. I guess to you it woukd have been preferable to die or be enslaved rather than fight. Makes total sense from where you're sitting right now doesn't it? Here you are enjoying the stability and peace that was hard won by your predecessors. Of course it's very easy for you to denounce them and their sacrifices. This is the definition of self entitlement. You aren't faced with such a decision so of course it's easy for you to shit on those who were.   What do the Iraq or Afghanistan war have to do with anything I've said other than the fact that it's a shitty attitude one must possess in order to crap on those who serve. I don't agree with either of those conflicts, but I'm sure as shit not going to blame the soldiers, airmen, sailors, or Marines that are fighting them. They don't get to choose what wars their countries engage in. You're like that guy who went to Chick-Fil-A and yelled at the cashier about the corporation's donations to anti-LGBT organizations.   Edit:  I'm not mocking anyone you obedient donkey.  Right.   Any veteran who preaches that "woo-hah" bollocks needs to be ridiculed for the idiot they are.   What was that again?        I'm glad you picked up on the condescension, because I was doing it as loud as I could.   There were only three images from the Iraq war out of twenty-four. This sub isn't for mocking and making light of the dead. Whether or not you agree with a country's policies, it's undeniable that nations need militaries in order to defend themselves. There's no reason to shit on those men and women who are drafted or volunteer to serve and sacrifice for their countries. If you want to talk about politics go to /r/politics or any other sub where that is the topic of conversation and they tolerate disrespecting the dead. You're clearly violating the rules of this sub by ridiculing the suffering of others.    Look son, I've read through your comment history enough* to know that I don't necessarily disagree with your politics. But there's no reason to be disrespectful to those who've come and died before you.   I'm not happy about anyone dying. I just don't think it's necessary to be disrespectful to the people who've sacrificed against their will. It's tasteless and valueless vitriol.    Maybe for Republicans.   Edit: Can one of you that downvoted me please provide an example of a Democratic candidate slinging mud at his or her opponent during this election cycle?    She's not wrong.    How admirable of you that you are able to observe all of the people in these photos of those who fought and those who died, and find the strength within to insult each and every one of them, their comrades, and their service to their countries and the world. It takes a special kind of person to make such elaborate and ridiculous work of converting O2 to CO2.   There is no conscription in the U.S.      And even if you're from a country that does have a national service requirement (like Finland or Israel) then you can still passively resist.   You really should do have a basic knowledge of the topic you're discussing or at least do a little research before you begin bloviating about a topic. American troops were drafted to fight in war until after the Vietnam War. Most of the soldiers who fought in WWII were draftees. Passive resistance resulted in serious prison time.     Too bad it's so american centered again..as if german,russian, japanese, british,candian,australian sodiers were not humans and didn't had their own share of misery and brutality  I seriously doubt that has anything to do with this particular album.   Edit: This is the PM response I received from /u/arenothome:  cool story nerd     You're thinking of "adolescence". Childhood is pretty much a universally accepted concept and has almost* always been so.    Until they find themselves faced with an unwanted pregnancy.    I don't know. I'm going to ask the mods.   Edit: I've sent them two messages and received no response. It doesn't mqke sense to me as this movement is obviously right-wing and obviously politically motivated. It seems pretty relevant to politics to me.   Response: what a conspiracy theorist writes on his facebook is not politics. Unless I was missing something he isn't a political figure.   Counter: He's the leader of a political movement. He's mobilized more than a hundred like minded conspiracy theorists in an effort to shadow our armed forces during a routine military exercise. The people of texas and right-wingers across the country are taking him very seriously. If you're going to disregard him, then you should also disregard posts about Donald Trump, Rand Paul, and Scott Walker.        Took you four days to come up with that response? You should be ashamed.   You should also be ashamed for demonizing people and children who are escaping poverty and abuse in countries that are in complete chaos as a result of backward, shortsighted US foreign policies. Have you no decency?                There's an [update] (http://www.lamag.com/tag/crimeinla/page/2/) in their crime section.    No one is disputing those facts. This is what I was talking about:  On the witness stand,Jean-Marc Connerotte(fr), the original judge of the case, broke down in tears when he described "the bullet-proof vehicles and armed guards needed to protect him against the shadowy figures determined to stop the full truth coming out.Never before in Belgium has an investigating judge at the service of the king been subjected to such pressure. We were told by police that [murder] contracts had been taken out against the magistrates." Connerotte testified that the investigation was seriously hampered by protection of suspects by people in the government. "Rarely has so much energy been spent opposing an inquiry," he said. He believed that theMafiahad taken control of the case.  Edit: grammar.    Well, if they would have followed Trump's lead and not served at all they wouldn't be having these problems. /s While Senator McCain was serving in the Navy and rotting in a POW camp, Donald Trump was enjoying four education deferments and one medical deferment.  Those deferments afforded this spineless turd the opportunity to insult the Senator's military service on a national political platform. If Trump had been shipped to Vietnam he most likely would have been fragged by friendly fire.    Read the wiki that was posted in this thread.    Oh I see. That means the comment was removed. They probably don't want people linking to personal Facebook profiles because that constitutes doxxing.    Some people just want to watch the world burn.    Okay, but is it a picture of wildcats that have been painted?    Did you forget about the midterm elections?   Also more voters turning up at the polls usually doesn't go well for the GOP. This is why they're so eager to implement policies that suppress voters.    This is a good way to inform would be thieves that you have an expensive gaming system and probably a nice TV in your apartment or house.    What is this?    I can't even begin to wrap my head around what's in this picture. So what the hell is their argument anyway?   Did you know that many US cities once had a basic trolley system? My town of 40,000 had one.    Nope. His profile just loaded up fije for me.    Sweden also has multiple mass transit options.    Where's the link op?    Those comments violate rule 2. Report them and let the mods sort them out.    Ahh, I see. Thanks.    It is 321 feet (98m, about 32 stories) tall and has base sides of 591ft; it is by some measures the tenth tallestpyramidin the world behind theRyugyong Hotel(1087ft),The Shard(998ft),Al Faisaliyah Center(876ft),The Transamerica Pyramid(853ft),Great Pyramid of Giza(456ft),Khafre's Pyramid(448ft),Luxor Hotel(348ft), theRed Pyramid(341ft), and theBent Pyramid(332ft)[7]. It is also slightly (about 16 feet) taller than theStatue of Liberty.  Where did you get the "sixth largest pyramid in the world", OP?    Different article from a different source. Not a repost.   You should read through the rules of [reddiquette.] (http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette)    The post that you linked to: http://www.clickondetroit.com/news/police-investigating-a-man-robbed-and-woman-sexually-assaulted/34214006  My post: http://detroit.cbslocal.com/2015/07/17/report-couple-ambushed-by-6-men-while-walking-down-detroit-street-stripped-of-clothes-and-sexually-assaulted/  Different articles from different sources. How is this a repost? Why is it worth bitching about?    So, why don't you go back there and stay?    *Absurd   Repost? Got a link?    50% pay nothing and that's no enough for you. The end. until next year when I see that again I've paid hundreds of thousands of dollars in taxes and your people pay zero and call us theives.   What does this even mean? None of it makes any sense.     James Boyd, Freddie Gray, and Walter Scott.    You're a trip man. I hope you can keep a better train of thought when you're driving.    That's a lot easier to do when you have at least one reliable form of public transportation. The US has none, and doesn't look like it will ever* adopt mass transportation.    So? People who have their licenses revoked are often able to drive on a waiver. This gives them permission to drive to work, grocery shopping, and official stuff like court appearances.    That would only make sense in areas with reliable public transportation which excludes the vast majority of the country.    That dog like all vicious police dogs should be be put down. It should be illegal to train animals to attack people just like it's illegal to train fighting dogs.    Perhaps you failed to notice the requirement that an officer must have Reasonable Articulable Suspicion in order to request that a citizen identify themselves. And that's only in states that have stop and identify laws. As far as I know, New Jersey does not. So what would be the legal grounds for asking for identification then?    This isn't about me. This about the workers of America. My income level is irrelevant to this discussion. I have provided a source on the 50% that don't pay taxes. You read it. There's no point in having a discussion with someone who is incapable of comprehending new information.    I don't disagree at all. But as long as we expect people to cover their own living expenses we should foster an environment in which that is possible. Raising the minimum wage has a direct effect on the spending power of worker's wages.    You seriously think that 50% of us would go under if we didn't get constant support from the government.   Yes. 25% are disabled and retired. The other quarter aren't making enough to survive. The ruling class or your "job creators" don't give a flying fuck about the retired and disabled and they'd pay the working poor even less than they do now if they were given the opportunity. You may remember the period in American history when the ruling class of the South paid their workers nothing.   How messed up is that assumption? Fully half of our country is dependent on the other half to make sure their fridge works...  I'd argue that everyone is dependent on others for survival in some way. No one produces everything they consume from day to day and no one is capable of it. The people in the top 5% of wealth and income are much more parasitic than the retired and poor. They don't work in any traditional sense. They're kids don't have to work. They live off the fruits of other's labor. They use their money and power to buy politicians and influence our political system. They've even got people like you to defend them while they do all of this.   That's not even close to being true and it's nowhere near the ideals that put this country in the leadership position it has now. If half the citizenry is taking rather than producing then in 20 years how many producers will there be? You have bought into this false idea that you need the government to succeed.   Either you have a very selective memory or you're very ignorant about US history. The economic "leadship position" we've enjoyed in the last 70 years or so is the result of being the only super power that wasn't ravished by war after WWII and the fact that our leaders enacted quite a bit of policy that supported and protected the workers of this country. Because of voters like you the workers in this country have lost the support and stability they enjoyed for some forty odd years after the war. Now you've been convinced that this is the result of lazy people rather than a ruling capital class that has only one objective which is to invest as little as possible, pay no taxes, and keep all of the profits from fruits of our labor. Man, they saw you coming from miles and miles away.      Bwahaha! Good one.    Yeah, this. Never call the police for help. They're not going to help you. They're going to make your problems worse and they may kill you or your loved ones.    Why, because you said so?    Oh, I think we all know damn well where these brigades originate.    While flying too low and colliding with powerlines is some serious dipshitery, none of that is evidence of him being treated differently because of his high ranking family. As far as his youthful behavior, you might be surprised about the culture of young service members and especially pilots. The flying too low thing is more common than you'd want to know too.   Source: Navy veteran who worked on F/A-18s and was attached to an airwing.    I don't disagree. I hope they find these assholes soon. I don't want to read about this happening to anyone else.    Yeah, that's not a source. That's just a paywall. And the title "Make* Believe Maverick" sounds more like an article attacking his political career, which I'm completely okay with.             Maybe a business that cannot afford to pay its employees a sustainable wage doesn't deserve to exist? As long as people have to pay for food, shelter, medicine, and transportation, we have an obligation to afford them the opportunity to cover these costs. Allowing wages to remain below the level of basic sustenance is criminal.    And then?     illegal brown people  Seriously?     Nope. He was a rich education and medical deferment case.    I never understood why religious people are opposed to abortion. The bible includes a detailed explanation of how to properly conduct a holy abortion. It right there in the book of Numbers, chapter 5. It's gods word so it can't be wrong, right?    Link?    Donald Trump is a pompous blowhard. He lacks even the most basic military experience. He has no clue what problems our veterans are faced with. His corporate executive experience includes bankrupting [four companies] (http://thelawdictionary.org/article/how-is-donald-trump-able-to-file-for-bankruptcy-so-many-times/), and most recently alienating his most powerful corporate partners. He's a business hack with no experience in politics and he wants to be the most powerful elected official in our country?             What's up OP? Where's the link?

 LOL, most American Muslims aren't even gun owners.          Narrations place her as old as 16, an din any case, it was no different than what was going on in other places in the world at the time. Then again, I'm wondering why we're jdpudging Muslims of today based on a one narration out of a possible many that took place 1400+ years ago. According to the bible, Noah repopulated the earth by having relations with his daughters. So we can we call Jews and Christians the followers of an incestuous prophet?    Oh, so you're an active member of the Church of England? Because that is the state religion.    I said actions, not party affiliation.   Fat chance, have you seen today's news?    Good for you. As a Muslim, I couldn't care less. Just respect our freedom in the same way you want us to respect yours.    Who made you the arbiter of patriotic loyalty in GB?    That's not the hashtag, but nice projecting there buddy.    Hey now, there's legitimate grievances there, and you can't look at this group and automatically label everyone that way. That's stereotyping.    Generally, I look at the actions of politicians to judge them, yes.    No, I'm pretty sure Sunni Islam believes the Mahdi will defeat him. They don't recognize the 12th Imam, but they do believe he is a descendant of the Prophet Muhammad. [Numerous Sunnis have claimed the title throughout history.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahdi)   Muslims believe that the Mahdi, a different person and a descendant of Muhammad, will defeat the Antichrist. Jesus will return though too and will recognize the Mahdi and follow him. The Mahdi is basically the Messiah in Islam.    Yeah, that's not true. There's an entire chapter in the Quran devoted to his mother, who is considered one of the holiest women in Islam, and there are several verses describing his birth, his life, the fact that he isn't the son of God (according to Islam), what he taught, etc.   Despite the source? Did you notice that the writer was Leander Schaerlaeckens? I know it was Yahoo!, but you have to look at the byline.   He was participating in the Civil Rights Movement back when Hillary was supporting Goldwater. That's not a joke.       The Miami Fusion and Tampa Bay Mutiny say hello.    Ask Jurgen.    Dude, he has a hamstring injury.    Jermaine Jones mistakenly spelled it that way in the weeks leading up to his transfer to New England, and we've spelled it that way ever since.    This was a nice article on Bill Hamid a few years ago dealing with the same thing: http://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/dc-uniteds-bill-hamid-finds-balance-between-body-and-spirit-during-ramadan/2012/07/31/gJQAWjUmNX_story.html   Never mind that there is already one power in the Middle East who already has nuclear weapons and refuses to sign any treaties.    No, it's a Zack Ryder - X-Pac tag team.       This article refutes everything that AIPAC says about Iran's nuclear program. I don't know what you're getting at.

That's every content provider on the internet, genius.    It's probably because he recommended Pao, and then saw her subsequently get crucified.    Because it could have backfired. Ellen Pao wants to protect hateful subreddits? The spin on that would be that she's no feminist at all, she's a hypocrite. Which probably speeds up her dismissal, but for different reasons.    We did it Reddit!   Synergy!      Username.    Fabinho might not be that good, but he doesn't count as a real LB?    And what happens when Brek is healthy again? Do they both play or does Ashe go right back to the bench?       Jozy is currently playing on a strained hamstring.    I enjoyed the DB DD with the BTs.    In this case, it's neither false, frivolous, nor potentially damaging (it's Reddit, for pete's sake), but nice try.    Olivia Wilde sort of looks like Lena Headley.    Thanks, but I doubt it will change a thing. I and others have called him out before.    Sematrix posts decent articles, but is a raging anti-Semite himself. Don't mistake his posts for legitimate criticism of Zionism, or of advocacy for the Palestinians. He represents neither.    I wonder if football fans will complain about penalty box and touchline lines on the field during NFL games.          One half of The Hart Dynasty, Tyson's old tag team.

The royal family pretty much do whatever they want, and only the ordinary citizens are subject to the laws.    Maybe in some European places, but most of the time I've heard he's not a part of any team organization until he is signed to a professional contract.   No, this isn't part of any rules. The same thing could happen in Europe if a team doesn't sign an Academy player to a pro contract.    Romenesko, Columbia Journalism Review, Reliable Sources on CNN, The Listening Post on Al Jazeera   Gaza's airport has been unused for quite a while now.    But was not signed to a professional contract, and under no ownership.             Am I the only one who thinks that the NASL should focus on markets without any MLS presence?    Probably not, unless he was signed to the team as a professional.    ...what?             Things get lost in translation. A new translation can be a new interpretation.       Barring women from going to school, for example. Nothing in Islam says that women can't be educated. Even in other countries with codes based on Islamic law, say Iran and Saudi Arabia, girls do attend school and university.       Uhh, what?

Great Sports Illustrated piece on Mudiay to people who don't know his story: http://www.si.com/nba/2015/06/24/emmanuel-mudiay-nba-draft-congo-china-texas-smu-larry-brown         There's stories like that narrated by other characters on the show too. Look up "history of Westeros" and "Histories and Lore" on YouTube.   From your [Wikipedia link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gordie_Howe_International_Bridge#Opposition), evidently the freaking Koch Brothers are involved too.    In early June 2011, the conservative group Americans for Prosperity posted bogus eviction notices on homes in Detroits Delray district. With the words "Eviction Notice" in large type, the notices told homeowners their properties could be taken by the Michigan Department of Transportation to make way for the proposed new bridge. The groups state director said the fake notices were intended to get residents to contact state lawmakers, to ask them to vote against the bridge project.[38]     Eh, I wouldn't be too sure. Can you think of anyone who would be willing to buy a book written by her? She's hated by people of most races and most political persuasions.    That's why people use terms like Latino or Latina and Chicano in addition to Hispanic, and why on most forms, Latino is not identified as a race, but as an ethnicity - you'll see a notation that says something like "Latinos may one or more races."   Where did you get your journalism degree from?    Try clicking the news section on Buzzfeed. There's no clickbait in there.    We don't know if he's the heir. Tyrion says that Trystane is the youngest son in season 2.    That looks like a display set up by Pringles Corporate, though.    Most communities who do that won't do that indoors, though.

That cloth is actually stained with rosewater, and that kind of decoration is only up in Muharram, when the tragedy of Karbala is being commemorated.    Brings my fast?   To combat sectarianism like this, go to Iftar this Ramadan to a mosque of which you are not the majority denominations and post pictures on social media with the hashtag. #IStandWithMyShiaCommunity, or #IStandWithMySunniCommunity and tag your friends.

I don't see how either of those has anything to do with freedom of religion.       I can't believe that guy is married to Avril Lavigne.    What is ends meat? Does it taste good?    It's the world's most popular name. Which Mohammed are you referring to? Mohammed Ali, the Moroccan king, my friend from the mosque, Egyptian national football team member Mohammed Salah...   "Only." And that's not really true, restaurants are ordered to stay open.     I think you mean "bear arms," and I fail to see how owning a gun has anything to do with the freedom of religion.       How diverse is the Nordecke? Not trying to start anything, genuinely curious.          You'd think there would be a couple from when Jay DeMerit played there.       It is known.

I can't remember where I read it, but "if anyone has an excuse to develop a spare tire around their waist, it's an over-the-hill luchador."   If you call split almost overwhelmingly against. ISIS's main opponents are also part of the Muslim faction.    I thought the Marines hadn't taken on the ISIS guild directly yet, instead backing the Iraqi and Kurdish guilds.    This is patently false. If you try a mosque forum, odds are you will be reported to higher level points before ever joining. The ISIS guild started from people who began on the fringes outside of the mosque forums. Many of the guild's recent members are people who checked out of the mosque forums because they didn't find any adversarial, vengeance seeking quests.    Yeah, I'm not following that fringe BS website, nor your completely reprehensible views.    In fact, I would rather let the Israelis kill every single last Palestinian man, woman, and child because at the end of the day, better them than us.     You're projecting your thoughts into my head. My ideal solution is one single state where Jews, Christians and Muslims are living wherever they want and worshipping freely. If you call the death of a Jewish-only state as genocide, then you are deluded.   The terrorists, the ISIS types, the ones who actually wish a military destruction of Israel would fight against "pro-Palestinians" if Israel is out of the way. They give Israel's military a justification, and most of us don't like that. It's why we have our own organizations and don't work with them.   I want what happened to South Africa to happen to Israel. Last I heard, when the apartheid there ended, there wasn't some genocide of white South Africans. Now, prejudices there still remain, but people there aren't subject to discrimination and massive human rights violations.    You're putting stereotypes into my comment when there is nothing there. You might be right about sematrix, but you might be surprised how many people support the Palestinian cause because they are against the injustices committed against them, not because of some reprehensible prejudice against Jews. I'm no supporter of people like sematrix, as you'll see elsewhere in this thread.   Groups like the Neuteri Karta, blogs like Mondoweiss (run by Jewish bloggers), individuals like Anna Baltzer and Max Blumenthal, and organizations like B'Tselem and Jewish Voice for Peace make it abundantly clear that the problem is not with Judaism nor the Jewish people.   I think people are downvoting you because of your reprehensible views, not because your statement is true. McCarthyist tactics are nothing to be proud of.    Sematrix, if you were just against Zionism and not Judaism or the Jewish people and weren't linking to a subreddit known as Gentiles United, I'd actually support you.    He's right. It's called canarymission dot com. Here's the [Forward](http://forward.com/news/308902/shadowy-web-site-creates-black-list-of-pro-palestinian-activists/) article on it.    What's the point of Tyrstane now? He's just going to get executed upon arrival in King's Landing despite having nothing to do with Myrcella's death. Or, even sooner if Jamie gets irrational and executes him on the boat.    What's to stop Jamie from turning the boat around and heading back to Dorne?    Does anyone have the video of him presenting the NXT Championship?    CLEGANE BOWL CONFIRMED   Your flairsake is still alive, at least we think.    Hey, we know who he is! He pays the iron price.

From Netanyahu's point of view, I mean. He's saying that the Palestinians will not know justice and freedom as long as Israel exists. I'm talking about Netanyahu saying it, not anyone else.    With or without context there is no way to justify that quote.                You Targaryens are a contentious lot.    A lot of scholars say that covering the neck is part of hijab.                I would add that the caste system has to figure into it. "The help" is probably not far off.          This is what I would say to those who argue that there no miracles today because religion does not exist. No, it's that they would still refuse to believe even if a miracle occurred in front of their very eyes.    Hodor.    Ser Loras would be happy.    Misplaced javelins can't melt steel plot.

A mistrust of Melissandre's methods.  Which is why the second season started with him burning a ton of people, and pledging loyalty to Melisandre.    The first guy who tries that is the first one killed.   	208
 "This research hasn't given humanity a cure to any diseases or made any claims of human life extension but it is an important first step in more fully understanding the lifecycle and function of cells."   I wonder whether the effects of menopause/hormone loss in older women contributes to this at all?   I agree with the points others have made here; in addition, even the idea of "dominant" and "recessive," although still taught in most intro biology classes, does not reflect how most genes work at all.  Genes tell cells how to make proteins.  Genes that code for proteins that are skin pigments, or a protein that helps signal to the cell to create more or less of a skin pigment, or a protein that helps transport or degrade skin pigment, will all have some impact on what the resulting skin color is.  Differences in the DNA sequence of any of these genes will make that particular protein work a bit differently, and how the body will be affected by having two somewhat different versions of that protein around (being heterozygous for that gene) will depend on what the protein usually does, how the sequence differences affects the protein's function, and how much that protein is being used by the body at a given time.  What all this means is: there is no one gene that makes skin black or white.  This should be apparent anyhow.  There are almost infinite different shades of skin in the world, not just two; and even a single individual will have a different skin color depending on their age, their exposure to sun, and other factors.  Even if you focus on a single gene that influences skin color, there aren't just two possible alleles, with one producing a dominant trait and one producing a recessive trait. How an allele affects a trait is kind of like how putting either white sugar, brown sugar, maple syrup, honey, molasses, or another sweetener into a cookie would affect the taste.  How that one thing interacts chemically with everything else in the cookie will determine what the effect is, and how noticeable it is in comparison with other ingredients.  If you'd like to read a cool pop science book on evolution in general (not at all related to skin color  . . . ) I recommend *The Beak of the Finch:* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Beak_of_the_Finch.   Another really interesting comparison discussed in the article is between individual ants and individual neurons in the brain.  The way that information spreads through a large ant (or bee) colony can actually be used to better model or understand how information spreads through the brain, and the way colony collectively solves problems can be similar to the way a network of neurons solves problems.  Hive minds are real!   This is a really speculative headline, not supported by the actual research findings; it also covers two primary research articles that have both already been posted, not a new research finding.  The research is incredible and their future plans include use of the "brain net" for therapy, but there's no current evidence of a therapeutic application.   *Lancet* article is here: http://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099%2815%2900153-X/abstract      All the comments here already are awesome.  I just wanted to add that at least for me, it isn't just about getting motivated/making myself get out there to run in order for running to alleviate anxiety and depression.  Although I'm sure the endorphins etc. help, it's also the feeling of accomplishment and sense of discipline that comes from having made myself do a tough run, or a run on a day when I felt tired and discouraged, that makes me feel more positive about myself.  On days when I feel useless and like nothing I'm working on is ever going to be successful, going for a run (even a short and slow one) can be something that I got to put a check mark next to and feel good about.  Find a time of day and a training plan that really work with your other habits and your schedule, so you have as few practical barriers as possible.  If you work starting at 5 PM (wow, 12 hour night shift sounds brutal) maybe run in the early afternoon, like a pre-breakfast run for other people? You could probably start by just running on your days off, and adding this in on an occasional workday as running gets easier.  Reward yourself with a playlist or an audiobook that you only get to listen to while you run, or something fun you only get to do on days when you worked out.  I think anyone who has run (maybe any adult who exists, actually) has been heckled at some point, although certainly some demographic groups have the misfortune to be a more frequent target.  If you do encounter that, just try to tell yourself inside your head (or maybe out loud, as long as it's not a physically threatening situation) that you feel sorry for them.  How pathetic that they can't find a better way to interact with the world around them.   Warning, anecdote follows!  I live where there is literally only one hill in town (and it's man-made!) and run races in other parts of the state that actually have substantial hills.  In my personal experience, there is no perfect experience for running hills, but a combination of speed work, parking garage ramps, and stairs (on different days, obviously) does help a lot.  Doing a longer run and some rounds of stairs in the middle or at the end seems a little closer to a run with real hills in it, than a workout that's mostly just stairs repeats.  I don't really know a good exchange rate; I just try to compare effort, not time or distance.   If I'm understanding the research correctly at all, it's not inherent to the bacteria alone.  It happened when the researchers added feedback from the robot to the bacteria into their theoretical model.  When the robot starts to get close to a food source, it sends a chemical signal to the bacteria that boosts all the signals they are producing. I'm guessing this first drowns out the original food signal a bit, then enhances it if it's a true signal, making the robot "rush" forward.  So although they haven't tested this in a real experiment, they predict from their model that this is a natural property that unexpectedly emerged from the two-way chemical communication between the machine and the bacteria.      No problem!  I should have also said, good luck with everything :-)   The original paper is here: http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nature14622.html         The researchers did not do anything to examine learning in this study.  They examined the impact of their transcranial stimulation protocol on EEG activity, and examined adverse side effects.  They suggest that this method of stimulation could someday be used in a therapeutic capacity, but have not tested this yet.  http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0131779#sec001   Really exciting work and a great direction of innovation for the future of the environment.  However: not made "entirely of wood." Made with "minimum use of expensive, environmentally toxic semiconductor materials," cellulose derived from wood, and epoxy coating to protect the cellulose from moisture.   I wish people wouldn't repost.  https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/3d9hi4/humans_have_more_primitive_hands_than_chimpanzees/?ref=search_posts  https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/3dagap/human_hand_more_primitive_than_chimps_study_says/?ref=search_posts  https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/3ddf0i/human_hands_may_be_more_primitive_than_chimps/?ref=search_posts   It seems like you'll just have to wait for further communication to know anything for sure, so don't take anything below too seriously, but:  1. It's possible they've waited because there's a potential funding source that makes it possible for an advisor/the department to accept you (or that covers another student, freeing up departmental funding for you; or another student who declines at the last minute.)  2. I've never heard of a rejection letter being approved by a dean, but my knowledge of administrative workings across the country isn't that great.  3. It's much less usual to be accepted without an interview, but it does happen.  Usually it's because of some mitigating circumstance (the applicant lives outside the country, or has unsurmountable time conflicts, for example.)  So maybe this means some sort of acceptance offer is on the way to you.  However, it does seem like you're missing some key information about what's going on, and if you're accepted, it will be under strange/confusing circumstances, and with limited options.  If you're very passionate about graduate school, it might be worth considering pursuing something related for a year (finding a job in a related field, taking some additional classes if that option is open to you, etc.) and then have another try at the GRE and the application process again in the next year or two, with more experience and maybe some better scores.  That could result in you being much more secure and confident entering the next stage of your education.  Graduate school is hard enough on self-image and emotional health already; going into it feeling shaky about your own confidence level, or the confidence of others in you, would be a rough position to start from.   I wonder what non-audible cues babbler birds use, if any, to help clarify their meaning in a social context :-)   Because sounds, visible markings, gestures, and a few other things can all be used to achieve symbolic communication, and in this case, a written symbol stands for a sound (which both birds and humans use.)  There are interesting analogies between many seemingly unrelated areas, including between animal communication and DNA, as the original commenter alludes to.   You said you had "simply no idea" what they meant by their second comment.  I just thought that could be misconstrued as a bit combative, so I was suggesting where miscommunication might be happening. This is a cool topic, so might as well keep the tone friendly, even if there are different ideas or levels of knowledge!  	22
 Its no secret that big cities have pigeon problems. Toronto was no exception. Like rats in the middle ages, the disease-carrying vermin spent the past decade running amok and increasing their numbers. It was my job to try and keep Torontos ever-growing pigeon population in check. Thankfully, I came across an article about a pilot project where researchers replaced pigeon eggs with wooden substitutes. The birds, too stupid to know the difference, spent months caring for the fake eggs instead of producing more. The project was a huge success, and the pigeon population decreased significantly in a short amount of time. It sounded like the perfect plan, so I implemented the solution in my city. What I didnt count on was for those fake eggs to hatch, and for the abominations inside to be released into the world.  ***  Clint, my partner, came in one morning carrying a large wooden crate with straw poking out of every crevice.  Looks like Christmas came early this year, he said, What is this stuff?  I walked over excitedly, helping him set the box down on a workbench, This, I said, prying it open to reveal its contents, is the solution to our pigeon problem.  Reaching inside, I took one of the eggs. I was a little disappointed to see that they werent wooden, as promised. Instead, they were thin, light, and hollow like those cheap plastic Easter eggs. It wasnt close to what I was expecting. *Oh well, thats what you get for ordering off of Ebay*, I thought.  Clint took a handful, *These* are the replicas you ordered? They dont feel remotely the same as the real deal.  We were well aware of what the eggs felt like. Up until then, the only way to decrease the pigeon population was to sneak into their nests and steal the eggs. It was a futile, temporary solution, because the birds would just lay new eggs once they realized theirs were gone. Thats what made the idea of using substitutes so damn good.  Its fine, Clint. They dont have to fool *us*, they just have to fool the pigeons. Thisll work, trust me, I answered.  I was right: the pigeons fell for it, hook, line, and sinker.  ***  A few months passed, and we started seeing a decline in the amount of younger birds in the area. I cant tell you how proud I was of what Id done. Id found a safe, environmentally friendly way of dealing with the flying rats, at the cheap cost of a few hundred dollars and an elevator trip to pigeon nesting grounds atop high-rise rooftops around the city.  The problems started about three months in. Clint and I were inspecting nests on opposite sides of the city. I was halfway up the building when Clint called me.  Yo, I said as I brought the phone to my ear.  The sound of wind could be heard in the background. Evidently, Clint had reached his destination, Hey. Some of our eggs broke, he announced.  The elevator came to a stop, doors swinging open to let me off. I stepped out and made my way to a small staircase leading to the rooftop.  Well just have to replace them. No big deal, I answered nonchalantly.  There had been a few violent storms since our last inspection, and I figured the eggs must have fallen from the nests and shattered on impact. *See, this is why wood would have been better*, I grumbled to myself, as I exited onto the rooftop for my inspection.  Well, fuck, I said.  What? answered Clint.  Most of my eggs were broken, too. The strange thing was that they were still tucked in the nests, right were wed left them. Had the pigeons figured out our ploy and attacked the replicas? Were the fake eggs too frail to survive our harsh Canadian weather?  I groaned, Its the same here. Were going to have to start over, I told him, defeated.  Clint laughed, Its all good, we can *hatch* a new plan.  I paused for a moment, Did you just- I began, but he interrupted.  Just look on the *sunny side up* of things, yeah?  Puns. At a time like this. Puns.  Dont yolk with me, I replied, with a sigh.  ***  We couldn't leave the nests unattended for too long, otherwise all our progress would go down the drain. I sent Clint to replace the broken eggs with what was left from our original order. In the meantime, I searched online for anyone selling wooden eggs. Unfortunately, the cheapest -and fastest shipper- was the person we'd ordered from the first time around. We needed these eggs quickly, and our budget was pretty tight. I figured I'd order the subpar eggs one more time. If they lasted long enough for city officials to see the plan was working nicely, then I was sure I could convince them to increase our budget so we could order better supplies next fiscal year.  Just to be sure the pigeons werent attacking our fake eggs, I also set up a security camera on one of the rooftops. I needed to know if theyd gotten wise to our ruse, though I highly doubted they had the mental capacity to do so. Still, the project would prove fruitless if the birds werent fooled by our cheap imitations, so it was best to keep an eye out.  ***  Over the course of the following weeks, I started getting strange reports about small animals behaving weirdly. Frankly, I didnt pay much attention to them, at first. They sounded a little insane, to tell the truth. One woman claimed shed seen a pigeon *climb* a tree. She said he crawled up the bark like a squirrel. Another report stated that a chipmunk had been seen attacking and killing a neighborhood dog. Another witness called in about an injured cat, but when he investigated, all he found was a pelt.  By the time I read the fifth report, I was starting to get a little worried. What was even more troubling to me was that these reports were coming from all over the city. If it had been confined to a single neighborhood, I would have suspected an outbreak of rabies, or a new disease of some sort. But the reports were coming in from all around Toronto *and* its suburbs, which span an extremely large area. How could anything spread so quickly? It had to be something else.  I was just about to do a bit of research on the subject when Clint came in, wearing a scowl.  Broke. Shitty fucking eggs broke again, he grumbled, throwing himself on his chair.  I forced a grin, *Crack* a smile, would ya?  He tossed his worksheet on the table, That was an egg-cellent pun, he replied, releasing a single chuckle.  You remember to bring the footage? I asked him.  He unzipped his coat and reached into his pocket for an SD card, Gotcha covered. Movie time! he chirped.  We uploaded the footage and took a look.  ***  Pigeons.  Pigeons sitting on their nests.  Pigeons preening.  Pigeons flapping their wings at one another.  A squirrel.  A squirrel getting chased away by birds.  More pigeons.  It must have been the dullest security tape in the world. The kind of footage that even David Attenboroughs lovely voice wouldnt be able to save. We fast-forwarded through days of pigeons doing pigeon-y things. Never once did they show any violence towards our replica eggs.  Clint had dozed off by the time something finally happened on-screen. The only reason I was still conscious was due to the copious amount of coffee Id ingested that morning.  It was dead of night. In the video, at least. One of the birds flew off its egg and perched itself on the nest, peering inside. *This is it*, I thought, leaning closer to the screen. I figured hed attack the egg, but I was wrong.  I watched as the video soundlessly continued, and something cracked open the egg --- from the *inside*. My jaw gaped open. This wasnt possible: the eggs were plastic shells. The only explanation was that wed missed one *real* egg somewhere in the bunch. Yeah, that had to be it. I was witnessing the birth of a baby pigeon, nothing weird.  Except baby pigeons dont look like smoke.  A puff of dark air came out of the egg. The pigeon, head inches from it, inhaled the gassy substance. It reared back and stood completely still for about a minute, before falling over. I watched as it started thrashing violently, like it was having a seizure. Then, from its beak spewed some kind of chunky liquid that evaporated as soon as it hit the air. The pigeons body seemed to deflate like a balloon, as though the creature was being hollowed out. I was left staring incredulously at the flat, immobile husk of what had once been a pigeon.  Suddenly, the pigeons chest bulged out and the animal regained its form. At least, sort of. Its proportions were all wrong: its wings were bloated and angled oddly, most of its girth was in its neck rather than stomach, and its midsection had stretched out unnaturally. It was like looking at an animal pelt draped over the wrong mound. Like a lunatic taxidermists cruel experiment. The abomination of nature jerked its head towards the ledge. It twisted onto his back, legs contorting and dislocating in such a way as to be able to reach the ground. From its throat, I could see stump-like arms stretching out, clawing at the cement rooftop. In quick and jagged movements, the creature skittered over the edge, and disappeared from view.  I was shocked, unable to believe what I had seen. I had to watch and re-watch the video several times, before it occurred to me to wake Clint up. He grumbled unhappily, rubbed his tired eyes, and looked at me.  You wont believe this, I uttered.  I rewound the footage and pressed play. His eyes widened with the same disgusted disbelief as mine. Even on my fifth viewing, I couldnt wrap my head around it.  This is bad, he said.   I know, I answered.  ***  After watching the video a few more times, we went home. I think we both hoped a good nights sleep would help clear our minds. Maybe, upon reviewing the tape, wed realize we were mistaken. Maybe it was a trick of the light? Unlikely, but we could only hope.  Clint was already at work when I came in. His eyes were glued to the screen.  Watching it again? I asked.  Not exactly, he replied,  I  kept going.  I approached the desk and peered at the monitor, Kept going? I questioned.  His face was pale and his eyes weighed down by large bags. How long had he been here? Had he come in extra-early?  There was two days left of footage on the card, he explained.  And you went through it?  Yeah   Did you see  more of those things?  Clint pressed his lips together, Yeah  and  some of them came back, he explained.  I raised my eyebrows, looking closer at the screen. I noticed something odd about one of the nests. There were multiple eggs resting in the sunlight. They were neither genuine pigeon eggs, nor replicas. They were too big for that.  Clint pointed to the batch, his hand trembling, *It* laid them, he murmured.  I felt a flush of nervous energy climb up my spine like an elevator, and then turned to the reports Id been reading the day before. Were the eggs at the center of it all?  We need to call the authorities, I uttered shakily.  We ARE the authorities, he replied, his voice sounding frantic.  I paced around the room. Back and forth, back and forth, like a pendulum.  The phone rang, interrupting my anxious march. It was another report of odd animal behavior. This time, the culprit was a deer. In a spooked and almost disgusted tone of voice, the woman on the line explained that she'd seen a deer slithering along the river. She said its body was sideways, but its head was upright. *Oh god*, I thought. What ever those things were, they could affect larger animals. While I tried to comfort the worried caller, I heard something from Clint's workstation.   **Crack**  I turned around, only to see a puff of smoke rising towards my coworker. Near his keyboard was a cracked shell, just like the ones on the rooftop. Without a word, Clint bolted to the bathroom, holding a hand over his mouth as though about to puke. I dropped the phone and ran over to the door. It was locked.  "Clint ... are you okay?"  Silence.  Silence.  Silence.  All of a sudden, I heard him heaving violently. A sound of moist gurgling and boiling water erupted from the bathroom. Terrified of what would happen if Clint got out, I pushed the heavy workbench in front of the door. I stood in terrified silence as the noise came to a stop. Was Clint now lying as flat as a pancake against the porcelain throne? Would it turn into some sort of bastardization of a human body, like what happened to the pigeon?  Silence.  Silence.  Silence.  **BANG**  Clint threw himself against the door violently. Just one blow nearly threw the thing off its hinges. Again and again, he slammed himself against the surface, causing the workbench Id placed in front of it to slowly inch away. All I could do was push myself against it to try and keep the door closed. My only thoughts were to keep him from escaping, for my own safety. I knew hed attack me if I let him out. I just knew it.  The sound came to an unexpected halt, allowing me to breathe a sign of relief. Maybe he'd expired. Maybe that *thing* needed fresh air to survive. Whatever the reason, I thought I was safe.  But then, I heard a crash. The window. I'd forgotten all about the bathroom window.  He's out there now. Him, and those other mutated atrocities. I don't know what they are or what they want. All I know is that they're roaming the city right now, doing god knows what. Most of them probably look like pigeons, but they can be anyone or anything. I just hope someone figures out how to stop them because, at last count, there were over 700 of those cursed eggs planted around Toronto. Now that I know these things can reproduce, god knows how many more eggs might be out there.  ***  [x](https://twitter.com/test_subject2689)   Go ahead and post this to /r/nosleepfinder . Someone is bound to recognize the story over there. Good luck!   It's all about scope. If the town is in the middle of nowhere, then maybe it can be wiped out without anyone noticing.   I think you should just change the names and locations. It'll make your story easier to follow than if you exclude names altogether.   You'd think people would be more responsible for their own needs, right?  It's especially puzzling since they can easily filter out things with trigger warnings to start with.   I see the trigger warning just fine.   A lot of people do it without asking for permission, but I have been approached a few times, too. It's not uncommon for their account histories to be empty: often times, they make an account because it's the fastest/easiest way to contact the writer.   If I'm not mistaken, I believe the limit is 40 000 characters (not *words*), but the textbox accepts more characters on-edit, so you can potentially increase the length after posting.  If you split the story up into series, make sure every part has a beginning, middle, and end and can sort of stand alone.  In my personal experience, I've found that stories around 1 700 - 2 000 words do better. Nice little bite-sized stories.   It's okay, you were part of a super-secret elite club!

Theoretically, you can't prove or disprove that supernatural entities exist. Therefore, it is *possible* for them to exist, so long as what they do doesn't affect a ridiculously large portion of the population, where one could easily disprove what happened. I.e. "A gang of vampires rode into NYC and drank everyone's blood" vs. "I saw a vampire in my basement."   I have below-average social skills and I'm not what anyone would describe as handsome.  That can't be right, Mr. Blank Lyset. I happen to know for a fact that people by the name of "Lyset" are handsome sons of guns.   There's a bit of "real life" in most of my stories, whether it be a description of a place I've been to, an object I saw that inspired the story, or an event that I twisted into something supernatural.  I did see a *lot* of weird stuff when I was in high school and have never written about it, mainly because there's no clear resolution. Sure, I could make up a whole backstory and ending to it, but it feels weird to me to embellish something that *actually* happened. If I'm going to embellish something, I rather take an event that had nothing supernatural to it, and supernaturalize it.

When I first saw her chained in that musky place, I was too drunk to figure it out. If only I had paid attention, I might have been able to save her.  ***  Judging by the dozens of missed call on my dying phone that afternoon, high school officials had informed my mom that I had skipped again. My friends and I had something more important to do than calculus: getting shit-faced drunk in the woods behind the school. Before we knew it, it got dark, and the group disbanded.  In my drunken haze, I must have taken a wrong turn, because I wound up deeper in the forest, where I came across a lone shed. As far as I could see, it didn't belong to any home or cottage. It was just there, in the middle of nowhere. *A hunters hut?* I wondered, *No. What the fuck would they be hunting here  groundhogs?*  Stumbling forward, I began hearing sobs escaping through the cracks of the old wooden structure. They were definitely the cries of a human girl. My head spun in a pleasant buzz, turning a simple walk into an awkward zig-zaggy trek. As I reached the shed, my foot sunk in a particularly deep patch of snow, causing me to lunge forward. My hand rose towards one of the walls for support. It went right through the wood, the plank disintegrating into soft mush, like a soggy piece of bread. *Gross.* After steadying myself and wiping my hand on my pants, I peered into the hut through the hole Id just inadvertently created.  It was blurry inside, though that was probably due to the alcohol in my system. I squinted to try and make out shapes through the darkness, but it was almost impossible to see. If I hadn't heard another whimper, I might have missed her entirely. There was a girl, maybe 5 years old, curled up in the corner. Her arms and legs were bound in thick iron chains, which rattled as she desperately pawed at a stuffed bear just out of reach. She looked up and, for a brief moment, our eyes met. I could feel her fear and sorrow, chipping away at my heart. Through her messy, curly black locks of hair, her lips stretched into a shy smile. She was covered in filth, but seemed otherwise healthy. *What kind of sick monster can do this to a kid?* I wondered.  H-hey, I called out.  Still wearing a solemn smile, she stretched an arm towards me, but the chains held it back. She didn't speak, but her hopeless eyes told me all I needed to know.  Ill get you out of there, I promised.  I staggered to the door, reaching for the handle. I pushed and pulled, but the damn thing wouldn't open. The simple latch might have been too much in my drunken state.  Returning to the window, I waved to get her attention, I'm going to go for help, I said, through slurred speech, I promise, Ill get you out of there.  ***  I ran straight for the nearest squad car as soon as I returned to civilization. My first mistake was banging the passenger window frantically to get the attention of the cops inside. My second mistake was screaming profanities at the cops as they tackled me to the ground and cuffed me. Why couldn't I have calmly gone up to them and explained the situation in a rational manner? I could have feigned sobriety. It obviously would have worked out better. Instead, I acted like a weird drunken teenager, cussing up a storm and making insane claims that Id come across a psychopaths murder hut.  I was arrested for drunken and disorderly conduct.  ***  Well, fuck, I murmured, as my jail cell locked shut.  Sober up, kid. Well call your mom to pick you up in the morning, said the officer.  *Fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck*, I thought, irritated. Id gone from trying to free an imprisoned child, to winding up just as locked-up as she was. Eventually, I dozed off on an uncomfortable metal bench in the back of the cell.  ***  In the morning, I was awoken by the sound of jangling keys. The prison guard unlocked my cell and led me to the main desk. I looked around for my mom, but she was nowhere to be seen.  So  I just get to go home now? I asked.  Yeah, he answered, barely paying attention to me.  And my mom ?  She bailed you out last night. She said, and I quote: Let that ungrateful prick sleep it off. He can walk home in the morning. Its called tough love, kid, he replied.  I furrowed my brows.  Yup, that sounded like mom all right. Probably trying to teach me a lesson, like that time she made me watch a *Scared Straight* marathon after I was caught shoplifting.  Did anyone check out that shed? The one I kept screaming about last night? I asked.  The officer laughed, patting me on the back, Yeah, we sent a few officers to scope the area. Theres no cabin, kid. Take my advice and lay off the drugs, he told me, using a condescending tone that reminded me of my father.  *Prick.*  I needed to go back, if only to prove what I saw was real. Mom was probably going to get a call from school again, but I didn't care. At least I was skipping for a *good* cause this time.  ***  There it was, behind a row of snowy maple trees. The small shed where I'd seen the girl. A new wooden plank concealed the hole I had made, suggesting someone had been by since my visit the night before. The door proved much less of a challenge in the light of day and without chemicals swimming in my blood. I was amused by my own inability to complete such a simple task while under the influence. The door scraped along the snow-covered forest floor as I pulled it open. Sure enough, there she was. The girl Id seen. Somehow, despite her awful situation, she was fast asleep under a thick blanket. She looked so peaceful that I decided not to wake her.  The door to the claustrophobically small shed closed behind me with a *click*. It was warmer than expected inside the cracked structure. Roughly the size of four office cubicles, the shed was full of oddities, such as an army of broken garden gnomes, bags of seashells, and old store signs, as well as normal shed stuff, like wheelbarrows, shovels, a car tarp, toolboxes full of rusted equipment, and a lawnmower. The weirdest thing of all was the net stapled to the ceiling. It wasnt a cheap little bug net, either. It was the kind you see on fishing boats: a big, thick net capable of holding thousands of unruly sea creatures. As far as I could tell, it served no purpose, other than to freak me out.  The girl stirred, her soft brown eyes opening. She immediately reached for her teddy bear, but it was still too far away. She pulled on hers chains, to no avail. There was little to no slack, especially on the ones around her ankles. I picked the teddy bear up, and handed it to her. An overwhelmingly happy smile was given to me as a reward. How could she be so upbeat, after the horrors she'd endured?   "I'm going to get you out of here," I said.   Kneeling down in front of her, I fiddled with the cuffs on her wrists. Unfortunately, lock picking was a skill I'd only learned in videogames. Try as I might, I couldn't get them undone. *Okay, no problem,* I thought. Maybe the chains were attached to the mushy, rotten, decomposing walls. Surely, I'd be able to break the wood to free her. I pulled off her blanket to reveal a concrete slab from which the chains emerged. It looked as though theyd been molded right into the block. I needed to use a different strategy.  "What's your name?" I asked, as I examined each link for signs of weakness.  She didn't answer. Instead, she just smiled and hugged her bear.  Well, my names Adrian, I told her.  I was really counting on finding rusted links that I could break off, but had no such luck. Unlike the other objects in the shed, the chains were in pristine condition. If I wanted to break them, I was going to have to use some tools. I rummaged through the toolboxes for anything that might do the trick. I hammered, I sawed, I reserve-wrenched, but it was all in vain. All I had to show for a mornings worth of work were a few scratches on a single link. The chains were simply too strong.  The girl silently watched me work. Every now and again, I asked her questions. Her favorite color, tv show, superhero. She only ever smiled to acknowledge my question, but kept her lips sealed shut.  ***  An animalesque whine escaped her lips while I was in the middle of sawing the chain for the fifth time. Half its teeth had broken off in the process, but I had stubbornly continued my work. I stopped for a moment and listened, only to hear footsteps approaching. She pointed to one of the corners of the shed, as though to telling me to hide. Like a cockroach, I scurried into the darkness, hiding behind the garden gnomes. One of them glared at me with his beady little eyes. *The fuck you looking at?* I thought.  A pair of feet came into view. I was half-expecting him to look like a flesh-eating lunatic of some sort, but what I saw was a middle-aged man dressed quite plainly. He shook snow off his salt-and-pepper hair, and closed the door behind him. There was a picnic basket nestled under his arm, which he set down next to the girl.  Lunchtime, Emma, he announced, his voice strangely mournful.  He pet the childs head and, to my surprise, she didn't recoil in terror. *Stockholm syndrome?* I theorized. The man began to pull out a variety of lovingly-prepared food items. Heart-shaped sandwiches, a bowl of warm soup, colorful fruit-kabobs, and even a cupcake for dessert. He took great care in hand-feeding her the meal hed made. As I lay there, watching the scene unfold, he gave me the impression more of a loving father than that of a murderous child-abductor. My stomach gurgled hungrily at the feast, but I tried to will it to stop, for fear that itd give me away. I couldnt help Emma if I got caught and chained up next to her.  Once she finished the meal, he put everything back in the picnic basket, and gave her a toy truck, "I'll be back in time for supper, honey. Be good," he murmured, kissing her forehead.  My face twisted at the sight. How could someone be so delusional? I stayed hidden long after he left the shed, just in case hed come back. Eventually, I crawled out, my stiff neck crackling with relief. Emma was playing with her new toy, a happy smile on her face.  My afternoon was spent much like the morning, hacking away at the chains, to no avail. As supper drew near, I became increasingly nervous. I knew her father would return soon, and I needed to get home. I had to make a tough call.   "I'll be back tomorrow, okay?"  She smiled and nodded.  I hated the thought of her spending the night alone, but I had to go. There was no other choice.  ***  I had only one mission when I got to school the next day: break into the janitors closet where he kept the lock cutter. I knew he had one, since the school had performed a random drug search on my unit the month before.  I followed Mr. Bentley as he roamed about, picking up litter in the hallway. Every time he looked my way, Id act like I was checking my phone. I'm not sure if he bought it, but my shifty behavior certainly didn't keep him from eventually unlocking the maintenance closet. I kept my distance, and waited for him to exit. Once he did, I subtly slid my foot between the door and its frame to keep it from closing. I slipped inside, heart racing, and searched for the lock cutter.  There would be trouble if I was caught, and I couldn't afford the delay. Emma needed me, and there was no way I was sitting in the principals office all day over something as stupid as borrowing school property. I had to be quick. Pushing through a pile of useless junk, I found what I came for: the cutters.  ***  It was snowing that afternoon as I travelled back into the forest. *Free the girl, bring her to the cops, be a hero*, I repeated to myself. They had no choice but to believe me if I brought her in. I clutched the metallic jaws close to my chest, my moist mittens sticking to its cold surface. Emma, as always, welcomed me with a big bright smile.  "This time, were getting you out," I told her confidently.  I prayed my plan would work, as I slid the lock cutter's jaws between her skin and the shackle around it. The cuff was tight and there was barely enough room for it to fit, but I managed to wiggle it in any ways. Emma looked terrified. Maybe she feared the device was going to cut her hand off?  "Don't worry, this won't hurt," I reassured, "On the count of three, okay? Deep breath ... one ... two ... three!"  I brought my arms down with all my might.   **SNAP**  She yelped as the cuff cracked open like an egg, freeing her right hand. It immediately reached for my arm, holding it tightly. I repeated the process until Id freed every limb. Then, I took her into my arms and ran towards the door, leaving the lock cutter behind. She was light. Lighter than I thought possible. Holding her was like lifting someone in a pool. Sure, she was small, but how could anyone be that light? She clung to me like a baby koala to its mother, her teddy bear squished between our chests.  ***  I ran through the woods, snow crunching under my feet. Once wed gotten far enough from the shed, I set the girl down. As I did so, her little hand grabbed mine in a vice-like grip. I forced a reassuring smile. I'd done a good deed. Now, I just needed to get her to the authorities. Child protection services ... the cops ... anywhere that could keep her father away. And I would have. I would have gone straight to help, if I hadn't felt the light tug, like that of a helium balloon, as we passed a park. She led me to the swing set, releasing my hand only once the other had grabbed hold of the chain. It was a dumbed-down version of what had been keeping her captive less than an hour before. An odd choice.  I pushed her for a bit, but as the sun began to set, I grew wary. Her father had surely returned to the shed by now and had realized shed escaped. Hed be looking for her, and I was sure the park would be the first place hed check. I stepped away, and motioned for her to follow. Instead, she clung to the swing set, her body trembling. A single hand outstretched towards me hesitantly.   "I've got to get you someplace warm, okay? C'mon. We can't play anymore," I answered.   She shook her hand, insisting I take it.  "Fine," I grumbled.  I took her hand half-heartedly, but the strength with which she held it made me realize she felt safe with me. I smiled and squeezed her tiny, delicate fingers. We took off towards the police station. Never once did she let go of my hand.  Then, it all fell apart. All because of me. Because of a stupid sneeze. I let go for just a moment. A split second, so I could cover my mouth. In the moment it took for my eyes to close and the air to torpedo out of my nose, the girl disappeared. I looked around me frantically. How could she have run away so quickly? I should have noticed it sooner, but when I did, it was too late. I looked at the snow to try and track her, but only *my* footsteps were present in the snow. There were two thin lines next to me, as though only the tips of her feet had touched the surface the whole time.  Something fell on my head. Something soft and squishy. Her teddy bear bounced off my forehead and landed at my feet. *No fucking way.*  I looked up.  She was floating, her body drawn towards the sky. Already, she was out of reach, yet her hand still extended down towards me, as though begging me to take it, to save her. Even as I jumped to try and bridge the distance, I failed to come close. It was like watching someone fall into a chasm in slow-motion. She started sobbing, tears falling like raindrops between the snowflakes. Her hand wiggled desperately, but she was already higher than the trees. There was nothing I could do. I wanted to save her. To go after her somehow, but I was chained down. Gravity was chaining me down to earth, like she should have been. I could only watch as she cried and floated up into the sky, helplessly begging for my help, until she disappeared behind the clouds.  ***  Even to this day, on quiet nights, I can still hear her wailing cries echoing above. Somehow, shes still out there, cursing me for breaking her chains. *** [x](https://www.facebook.com/lyset.manen)   Funny you should bring up Enigma of Amigara Fault, my sister showed it to me several years ago, and I was thinking about it this week and found the scans. o_o Coincidence? DUN DUN DUUUN.  It is such a freaky story.   That was captivating.   That's precisely what I'm trying to figure out, through careful observation.   It just so happens that I want to write a story about the eating habits of AMCs in their natural habitats. Time to get some binoculars. See you outside in the bushes, bud! :)   Truer words have rarely been spoken.   Maybe she bit her nails raw, and now she has to wait to grow them again. Hopefully she'll be back soon!   Yup! I don't dare ask about Rod, though. Counting myself lucky that they agreed to unshadowban Manen.   Thank you, Papa Fargold. :)   I am the ghost of Christmas past, come to tell you to be nice, lest your stockings be full of coals.   o_0 Eh? How on earth?   FUN FOR THE WHOLE FAMILY ESPECIALLY FOOS LIKE ME WHO GREW UP WATCHING THE TV SHOW. :D   YES I AM EXCITED.   About a month ago, I broke one of the hinges off the cupboard above my computer at work. Since then, the door wont shut all the way. I called maintenance to fix it, but they warned me they had a massive backlog of calls and wouldn't be able to get to me any time soon. Sure, seeing the door perpetually ajar was annoying, but I thought it best to leave the work to the professionals. The last thing I wanted was another citation from the workers union for overstepping my bounds. Last time I had the nerve to fix a loose screw on my chair, they lost their shit. As long as it didn't threaten to fall on my head, I figured there wasn't any harm in waiting. It wasn't until my colleague went on vacation last week that I realized I was wrong. There was something in my cupboard that only came out when I was alone.  Having an office to oneself is probably every cubicle farmers dream. Privacy, space, and silence are things most people covet at work. Not me, though. In spite of being very high on the introvert scale, I have a need to be around people. I dont want to talk to or interact with them, mind you, but I find comfort in knowing others are around me. I also find it easier to concentrate when I *have* to make an effort to zone people out. Otherwise, I get distracted by ambient noise. Id only been alone in my office for a day, and already, I was feeling lonely. It wasn't just that the person sharing an office with me was gone, it was that almost everyone was away on vacation. I couldn't even hear people chatting about their weekend in the hallway, like they normally did. All I could hear was the clock ticking slower than on a Friday afternoon in high school, the sound of traffic outside the window, and tapping above my head.  Tap tap    Tap tap    Tap tap   The tapping sound wasn't normal.  My eyes darted towards the cupboard in a hurry, fearing the door was about to fall on me. Thankfully, it was as still as a vegan pondering the moral implications of everything on lunch menu  when they *didn't* have someone there to complain to.  Upon tilting my head, I noticed something inside the cupboard. Through the dark crevice, I saw two brown eyes starring right at me. I nearly had a heart attack as I rolled away from my desk in a frenzy. A flurry of possible explanations flooded my mind: it was a prank, a plush toy, a photo, a trick of the light. As I contemplated the many possibilities, I saw the eyes blink, and then retract into the darkness with a scurrying sound. I tried to still my frantic heart by taking a few long breaths, but it was as successful as using a single pouch of sand to stop a flood.  I was terrified. If it had been a prank and Id been filmed, my reaction video would have gone viral. Here I was, an adult, freaking out over nothing.  Horses still galloping in my chest, I reached for the first solid object at my disposal: a large photo frame hanging on the wall. I'm not sure how useful it would have been as a shield *or* as a weapon, but holding the 11x17 wooden frame made me feel just a *bit* safer. Slowly and cautiously, I reached a trembling hand to the cupboard door. Swallowing saliva as thick as rubber cement, I pulled it open, readying myself for what might be inside.  The cupboard was empty.  Well, not completely empty. My gym bag, emergency clothes, and work-related books were all in their respective places, but that was it. No creepy teddy bear, no scary photo, and, more importantly, no monster. I let out a sigh of relief, and laughed at myself for getting so scared. *Youre just imagining things*, I thought. Yeah, imagining a pair of eyes in the cupboard. Why not? I closed the door as far as it would go, and went back to work. For the rest of the afternoon, I jumped at every snap of the building settling and every gust of air from the A/C unit. My eyes continuously checked the crack above my head while my body tensed to the point of making my neck stiff. I felt like a child afraid of an unclosed closet door at night. I was beyond happy when it was finally time to go home.  By the next morning, Id convinced myself that I was being silly. There was nothing in the cupboard. Heck, there wasn't even room for something to hide there anyway. It was business as usual for most of the morning, though as the day wore on, the feeling of loneliness came back. Even when he was around, it wasn't as though my office mate was chatty: we barely exchanged more than a casual hello and goodbye, but his absence still weighed heavily on me. I needed his presence, if just to hear his chair squeaking or his exasperated sighs whenever the boss emailed us. It was just so quiet without him there.  Tap tap    Tap tap    Tap tap   I heard the light tapping sound above me. The hairs on the back of my neck turned to porcupine quills.  Tap tap  tap tap    Tap tap  tap tap    I looked up.  Tap tap  tap tap  tap tap    Tap tap  tap tap  tap tap    A hand. A shrivelled, rust-colored hand fingered out of the cupboard through the open crack. Its black, broken fingernails tapped against the polished surface in a rhythm that seemed to mimic my heartbeat. They moved faster as I pulled away and screamed a gut-wrenching scream.  TAP-TAP! TAP-TAP! TAP-TAP!  My heart pounded against my chest with the force of a crash test car smashing into a brick wall. To hell with logic, I reacted with pure instinct, leaping off of my chair so I could swing it towards the cupboard door. The hand retracted as I hit the surface, and pushed the door shut in one quick motion. The entire cupboard and its supporting structure shook wildly for a few moments, but then it stopped. I kept my chair over the door for as long as I could, until my arms tired, and I had to set it down. The broken door creaked open, but nothing came out.  I dont know whether it was bravery or stupidity, but I opened the cupboard to try and see who was inside. Once again, I found it empty, but for my belongings. I took everything out, and then checked every nook and cranny for an explanation. Whoever or whatever was messing with me had to have a point of entry. Maybe it was some homeless person living in the walls? I dont know. Id read stranger things. Try as I might, I couldn't find an opening. Everything was bolted in tight, not a loose panel in sight. *Fuck this*, I thought, gathering my things. I wasn't spending another minute in that office.  Come morning, I knew I had to go back to work. The boss would notice my absence. Still, I took precautions: I brought my tools to work. Union citation be damned, I was taking apart that cabinet. It took all morning, but I finally managed to dismantle the cupboard and its supporting structure, leaving only a bright white wall in its place. I piled the disassembled pieces on my colleagues side of the room, and went back to work.  Id love to say that thats how my ordeal ended, but it wasn't. You see, this morning, I came in to work again. At first, everything was perfectly normal. By noon, I was feeling lonely, but then, I heard something coming from my co-workers workstation. I wheeled myself over and saw that the cabinet pieces were missing. *The janitor probably threw them away*, I hoped.  As I turned back towards my desk, I noticed my recycling bin was shaking lightly. Had I accidentally hit it?  Tap tap   Tap-tap  Tap-tap  Tap-tap   The familiar, heartbeat-like sound filled my ears as I approached the bin, increasing along with my own beat. I began to quiver as I looked into the inside. Beneath unorganized stacks of discarded papers, I could see two brown eyes staring back at me.  I ran away, without even locking the door behind him.  Now I'm home, where its safe, quiet and alone. Where all I can hear is the TV in the background, and the tapping from the kitchen.  Tap tap   Tap tap   Tap tap          *yes*      ...   Ouija boards. Dead authors. Yes/No questions.  Let's make it happen.   Because I don't have a teddy bear to hug.   Dibs on the cheerleader's missing leg.   Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? NO.   There's a legend that says that, if you eat a forbidden fruit, you'll be devoured from the inside-out by the creature who made it.   I'm game.   I just might have to make her my wife!   EFF YEAH!!!!!!!   I think you might be turning into Quezacotl...   Stories about parasitic lice infesting green apples that, once eaten, turn the eater into Quezacotl.   This sounds awesome. I'm more into *listening* to the stories than *reading* them, so it's definitely not the job for me.  That said, if you ever want to hire someone to sit in the corner of your studio and hum non-stop for 12 hours a day, I'm your guy. I accept home-made rice crispies bars as payment.   Oh, you!  Nope, still very much ONTARIAN.   I can only answer this question as a handsome, well-mannered moose-riding Mountie Canadian.  The 4th of July is the day 'Murica had a huge tea party in Boston right after Christopher Columbus docked, bringing nice blankets for all the aboriginal people. His boat accidentally hit something, sending oil barrels ablaze, which is how they invented fireworks. Then, a bunch of dudes in red coats came in with spiky guns to try and help clean up the mess, but were attacked by bald eagles, led by Abraham Lincoln and John Handcock. Eventually, they wrote a few story ideas on a napkin, but Handcock sneezed in it, so they glued on a few extra napkin amendments to fix the paragraphs that got smudged by his nose-sludge. And THAT, my friend, is 'MURICA DAY.   I put the 'Man' in 'Manen'. ;D   Happy birthday, my 'murican buddies.   That's *one* way to teach your kid not to bite people.   In the depths of the Black Forest, creatures unknown to man lurk out of sight. Chances are, youll never see the monstrous lifeforms that haunt the labyrinth of ancient tree roots. That is, unless youre foolish enough to visit the forest on a cold winter night.  You see, there is *one* being in particular that has been spotted at the edge of the forest. They call it Mr. Tickler. Dont let its name lull you into a false sense of security: theres nothing innocent or whimsical about him. It is unknown exactly how many have fallen prey to him. People go missing in the woods all the time, whos to say Mr. Tickler isnt to blame for all those disappearances?  Few have encountered the creature, but those who have all describe the same thing: a tall man, an elongated and hooked snout, large insect-like eyes, bony arms, and fingers so long they drag on the forest floor. If youre not careful if youre too busy looking at its hideous face you wont notice those fingers stretching towards you, slithering over the grass like an army of snakes.  I saw him once, and I will never forget it.  Agatha was two years my junior, but she was the more adventurous of my siblings. On a quiet, moonless night, she had me follow her to the edge of the Black Forest. The forest floor was coated in half an inch of snow and a thin layer of fog hovered over the damp, leaf-covered soil. In the distance, I could hear something walking.  We should go back, I urged.  She laughed and tip-toed past the first line of trees, No way, scardy-pants! she replied.  Thats when I saw him. In the mist stood the horrendous creature my parents had warned me about. Its face was like a medieval plague doctors mask, it wore tattered robes made of tree bark, and its hooved feet dug into the ground with each step it took. I wanted to run to my sister, but my body wouldnt move.  Agatha, run! I shouted in panic.  She froze when she saw him, as though in a trance. I watched as its boneless fingers slowly approached. They ensnared her slowly, as though Mr. Tickler knew we wouldnt fight back. They began to wiggle, causing her to burst into a fit of laugher. Her head tilted back, tears streaming from her eyes as intense chuckles escaped her lips. Slowly, he began to drag her into the forest.  I remember the sound of her frantic, uncontrolled laugher echoing farther and farther away, until I heard an ear-piercing crunch. Then, nothing. Just wind in the trees.  If you find yourself near the Black Forest on a cold December night and hear laugher in the distance, then youll know Mr. Tickler has captured its next meal. If all is quiet, then you should run, otherwise he might come for you.   I get to go home?! With pleasure! :D I'll tell my boss that Tim Young told me I had to leave early.  He'll then look up and ask, "But  who is Tim Young?"   Don't you mean when the Dolphin is a**fin**?   The weirdest thing is that fact that they **can** show their support, regardless of whether or not NoSleep goes dark. NoSleep gives you the option of protesting if you want to, and not protesting if you don't.  Those who want to protest have a lot of options open to them: not generating content, sending a reasonably-worded email to the Reddit admins, failing to provide traffic to the website, etc. Reddit runs on user-generated content. If a million users stand up and say "NO!", it'll have a big impact.   Thanks for the warning, glorious steed.   I wonder if the tree's roots extend towards hell in a prayer the same way its branches extent towards the heavens.   Well, that's certainly one way to break the ice with a lady.   Cool! :O   [I found a tooth on a white sand beach](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/3art1n/i_found_a_tooth_on_a_white_sand_beach/)   They definitely didn't go about it the right way. That's not how you build a good reputation. Quite the contrary.   I got the same message this morning and responded by telling them they should ask permission before posting stuff, though I'm unsure whether or not they'll heed that advice.   It was spelled with just one 's', which doesn't really surprise me. I've seen "Nite Clubs", "Breathe Rite Strips", and other such barbarisms in store/brand names. These guys -if they're real- used the correct spelling of the expression "Just deserts".   Happy Canada Day to my fellow Canadians! :D Go Canada, Go Canada. It's your birthday, it's your birthday!   Cake. Who would have thought you could be afraid of something as sweet and innocent as cake? I didn't think it possible, until I broke up with my boyfriend last month. Id endured months of emotional and psychological abuse before I finally mustered up the courage to leave him. In the weeks following our break-up, I started receiving threatening cakes, each with a message more disturbing than the next. Now, I'm sitting in a hospital bed, terrified of what the latest cake had to say.  Looking back, I'm not sure what I saw in Brad. At a bar, I overheard him ranting about the women hed slept with. He acted crudely, catcalling the waitresses and starring at the butt of any lady who dared walk in his line of vision. Judging purely by the pick-up lines he used and what little conversation I could hear, it was clear that he was no stranger to using foul language to speak to and about women. I know what it sounds like; you probably think I was a nave young woman who thought I could fix the proverbial bad boy. My attraction to him  if you can call it that  had nothing to do with such a childish thing. No, I wanted to beat him. I wanted to be the one that got away. The woman he thought he could woo, but who wouldn't give it to him no matter how much he begged. I wanted to take a stand on behalf of all the women hed wronged, and show him how much backbone the fairer sex really had. He was my opponent.  A simple wink and a wave was all it took to get his attention. He sent a drink my way, quietly approached, placed a hand on my shoulder, and leaned in to whisper a pick-up line so lewd and disrespectful, I dare not repeat it. I forced a giggle and playfully nudged him. My trap was set. The problem is, I was the one who ended up ensnared. It turned out that, after you got past the absolutely disgusting first layer of his personality, he was rather charming. One thing led to another, and we started dating. Before I even knew what had happened, we had moved in together. Thats when the abuse started. It was little things, at first. Accusing me of looking at other men, checking my text messages, telling me my clothes were too slutty, etc. There were so many signs I should have seen, but hindsight is 20/20. It wasn't as though it happened overnight. Brad progressively chipped away at my ego until I felt like a failure as a woman. I was afraid of living without him. He had me convinced that no man would ever want someone like me. Every time we fought, hed reel me back in with a grand gesture of some sort, and promises he never intended to keep.  Then, one day, we got into a huge argument over one of my co-workers. As usual, he called me every name in the book: slut, whore, skank  nothing was off-limits. Dishes were broken, holes were punched in the wall, and things were thrown. The situation took a drastic turn for the worst when Brad lifted his arm and backhanded me hard across the face. I fearfully retaliated by biting him, and ran out the door while he shrieked in pain. The first time he hit me was going to be the last.  I stayed at my mothers house for a few days while I tried to get my head back on straight. Id left everything behind: my money, ID, clothes, and even my phone. Fearing Brads wrath, I steered clear of our shared apartment until I was certain he was at work. Even then, I asked for a police escort in case he showed up. Judging by the fact that he hadn't thrown away my belongings, I deduced that he thought I was cooling off and would come crawling back to him any day now. He was dead wrong. While the officers waited patiently at the door, I took the essentials, leaving my furniture, decorations, and cookware behind. I wanted a fresh start, even if it meant having to re-purchase household staples.  Before long, I was moving into a fabulous new apartment across town. Rent was fair, the neighbors weren't snoopy, it was closer to my workplace, and, best of all, there were no memories of my ex. None of his toenail clippings, body spray, or stupid NFL memorabilia. I felt fortunate in my misfortune: starting over wasn't easy, but it was exactly what I needed.  ***  Id just gotten settled for the evening, when the doorbell rang. The hallway was empty, but there was something waiting for me on the doormat: a plain white box without any identifying features, tied with a curled pink ribbon. I picked it up and brought it to the kitchen, examining it closely. Using a knife, I cut off the ribbons and opened the box. Inside was a vanilla cake with lavender-colored buttercream icing. Square in the middle of it was something written in dark purple script:  Welcome Karen!!!  For a split second, I thought it might have been from a neighbor. No, that couldn't be it. I hadn't had the chance to introduce myself yet. Besides, if the idea was to welcome me to the neighborhood, then surely they would have waited for me to answer the door so we could chat. Had my mom sent it? It wasn't really her style, so I called her, and she denied having knowledge of it. Perplexed, I searched the box for any clue, and found a business card for *Just Deserts Bakery*. On it was a ten-digit code, an address, and a phone number. I felt a pang of worry in my chest. What if Brad had sent the cake? Id been careful not to share my new address with anyone, but what if hed been following me? Anxiety began to bubble inside like the magma in a slumbering volcano. Nervously, I dialed the number listed on the business card to get some answers.  Once the call connected, a playful jingle tickled my ears. It was followed by what sounded like a grown woman talking in an obnoxious baby voice. You know, like on those kiddie shows where the host talks to kids?  Welcome to Just Deserts Bakery! We hope you enjoy your Just Deserts!  The tagline made me cringe.  Were sorry, but our store is closed right now. If you want to check the status of your order, type the 10-digit order number followed by the pound key, she continued, her voice still as annoyingly energetic.  I typed the order number on my card, heart racing. *Please not Brad, please not Brad, please not Brad*, I repeated in my head.  There was a slight pause on the line, and then the voice spoke again, Looks like you received our Super-Duper Vanilla Surprise, courtesy of- it began, but the sing-song tone was replaced by an ear-piercing robotic voice, anonymous.  *Well, that doesn't help me*, I thought, biting my fingernails as I nervously paced back and forth. I hated to let good food go to waste, but I was smart enough not to eat something that, as far as I knew, could have been laced with rat poison. If the sender eventually revealed himself as someone other than Brad, then I would lie through my teeth and tell them I loved the cake. If it was from Brad, then I was definitely not eating it, whether or not it hed sabotaged it. For my own peace of mind, I tossed the cake in the garbage bin, and went to bed.  I woke up the next morning feeling rejuvenated. As I walked through the kitchen, I could smell the sweet scent of cake rising from my garbage can, reminding me of my woes. *Brad knows where I live*, I worried. I went about my day, trying not to think about him. It was *my* life and *I* was in control. I didn't want to be a slave to his abuse any more, yet it was hard to stop hearing his disapproving words whispered in the back of my mind. *Youre not good enough. Youre a bitch. Button your top, you whore.* I closed my eyes, took a deep breath, and tried to keep my head held high.  Another package was waiting for me when I got home. Same white box, same pink ribbon.  Enjoy your Just Deserts! it read, same as the bakerys motto.  The cake was different this time. Chocolate with cherry icing, or so the *Just Deserts Bakery* hotline claimed, when I called to check the order. I was surprised that they were still closed, but not shocked to find out that the order was sent anonymously. Chocolate was my favorite, so throwing *that* cake out was more painful than the first. Still, my safety was far more important.  The following day, another cake found its way onto my welcome mat. I didn't even have time to debate whether or not I should throw it out, because when I opened it, the message inside frightened me so much that the box slipped through my fingers, and the cake splattered onto the floor.  I'm going to slice you up like a birthday cake.  It was Brad. It *had* to be Brad. He was fucking with me, like the scumbag that he was. I called the bakery, but still couldn't get through to a human being.  Like clockwork, another package showed up on my doorstep the following day. This time, it contained four cupcakes, each with a different letter written in bold.  S-L-U-T  Lovely.  The next day at work, I called the bakery. I figured they closed early, and that Id be able to catch them during normal business hours. I had a hunch theyd refuse to reveal the name of the sender not that it wasnt blatantly obvious but I would made damn sure theyd ban my address from future deliveries. Hopefully, Brad would get the message and move on.  Welcome to Just Deserts Bakery! We hope you enjoy your Just Deserts! Were sorry, but our store is closed right-  Fuck! I shouted, tossing the phone aside.  That night, I had a date with an old friend from college. We had a pretty great time, and I ended up staying over at his place. When I tried to sneak out the next morning, I nearly tripped over a box on his front steps. *No way*, I thought. My hands shakily pulled the ribbons loose, and I peered inside.  Twinkle twinkle little whore, shut your legs, theyre not a door.  I recoiled in terror. Brad was *stalking* me. I knew it.  The abuse didn't let up. Every day, Id get home and another cake was waiting for me. Every damn day. Why? If he knew where I lived and if he was following me around, why hadn't he shown his face yet? Was he trying to torture me? Slowly drive me insane? He must have spent a fortune buying all those cakes, and for what? To scare me? If that was his intention, then it was working splendidly. I was terrified, looking over my shoulder and through my blinds every few minutes. Scared of every shadow I saw and every headlight in the window. It was only a matter of time before he made his move. Every day, Id get another horrible message. Fuck you, bitch, Good riddance, and my personal favorite, This is poisoned. *Subtle, Brad. Real Subtle*, I thought. I tried calling *Just Deserts Bakery* at various times of day, but no one ever answered.  Why did I even bother opening the boxes? I knew there was nothing good inside, just more abuse. More *Brad*. The scent of sugar infiltrated every corner of my apartment. I was sick of the odor. It was on and around me at all times. Even at work, I swear I could smell it.  ***  Out of the blue one day, I got home and my welcome mat was empty. Relieved, I headed inside and relaxed for the first time in weeks. Maybe Brad had found a new plaything. I felt bad for whoever had to deal with him, but glad that he wasn't my problem anymore. I slept like a baby that night. That is, until a familiar scent woke me up in the early hours of the night.  My alarm clock read 3:57 a.m., its dim red light illuminating something large sitting on my bedside table. I squinted, my blurry eyes making out the outline of a white box. *Oh god, no*, I thought. I jolted to my feet, and turned on the lamp. Hed been inside my home. The message on the cake wasn't as rude as the others, yet it was somehow more unsettling than the profanity Id grown accustom to.  Youre beautiful when you sleep.  It was time to take matters into my own hands. I had the bakerys address, so I decided to head there right away. After all, bakeries were supposed to open early, right? Someone was bound to be at the store. I would explain my situation and, if they refused to cooperate, would threaten to involve police. Surely, they could get a warrant to figure out who was sending the cakes. I could have Brad arrested for harassment. I felt elated at the thought of finally being free. The law was on my side, after all.  It must have been around 5:00 a.m. when I pulled into the empty strip mall outside of town. My face twisted as I noticed the condition the building was in. It was in complete disrepair: walls had crumbled, the foundation was cracked, windows were broken, and store signs had faded away. *Just Deserts Bakery*, if it had *ever* been in the strip mall, was long gone. I couldn't even find a semblance of their logo on any of the store-fronts. When I got out of my car to peer into the broken building, all I could see were remnants of clothing stores and a bowling alley. There was nothing even remotely resembling a bakery.  Defeated, I headed back to my car. My heart sank as I opened the door. The sweet scent of cake came pouring out of the vehicle, emanating from a cake on the passengers seat.  Die, bitch.  My eyes scanned the area quickly, but I couldn't see Brad. Was he hiding in the back seat? I hadn't heard footsteps, but I wasn't really paying attention before. For a moment, I thought about hiding in the abandoned mall, but what if Brad was waiting inside to jump me? I was stuck between a rock and a hard place. I backed away from my car, whimpering like a child, and called the cops. I waited for ten whole minutes in the exposed lot, halfway between my vehicle and the building. If he was in the strip mall, then I would have time to flee to my car. If he was in my car, then I would have a head start when running away.  By the time the police arrived, I was feeling really light-headed. I think I was tiptoeing on the verge of a full-blown panic attack. The officers let me sit in their squad car while they checked every nook and cranny of my automobile. I watched nervously, expecting Brad to jump out at them with a knife. Thankfully, the car was empty. Once theyd deemed the area secure, one of the officers took me aside while the other contacted the station to put an APB out on Brad. I was relieved to see them take the death threat so seriously. The officer listened as I told him about the break-up, the harassing cakes Id been receiving since, and the break-in that morning. He retrieved the bakerys business card from the cake, which, by that point, was melting on the hood of my car. He gave the number a call.  Says it isn't valid, he told me.  Thats not possible, I replied.  I tried calling *Just Deserts Bakery* using my own phone. By then, I had their number on speed dial, since I called them more often than I called my mom. Sure enough, an operator told me the number was no longer in service. I became even more agitated. Brad had gone through an obscene amount of trouble to mess with me, it seemed.  After about ten minutes, the second officer interrupted, Mam, he said, tilting his head.  Still shaking, I nodded, Y-yes? I asked.  You say youre being stalked by Brad Clarkson, right? he asked.  I nodded again, Yeah  He frowned, We have a report that he committed suicide, mam.  Blood drained from my face. Had he run off into traffic after putting the cake in my car? The hairs on the back of my neck rose like soldiers at attention. As disturbing as the revelation was, at least it meant I was safe now. I wouldn't have to endure his harassment anymore. It was a bittersweet feeling, but I didn't want to celebrate too much. The last thing I needed was to arouse suspicion. If anyone had motive to murder Brad and make it look like suicide, it was me.  O-oh. Okay, I answered, H-how?  He turned around, exchanging a few words with the station, Gas from the oven. Its just like going to sleep, he answered.  I raised a brow. Something wasn't adding up. Brad lived an hour away from the strip mall. How could he have dropped the cake off, driven home, killed himself, been found dead, AND had a report filed about it?  There has to be a mistake. He was here an hour ago, I protested.  The mans lips wrinkled into an awkward frown, I'm sorry mam, but hes been dead for a month, he said.  *Thats impossible*, I thought, turning to the cake. My head was spinning. If it wasn't Brad who had been sending me these cakes, then who was it? I felt my breathing accelerate beyond control as a burning sensation ran down my spine.  Listen, mam, well get an undercover cop in your area, all right? suggested one of the officers, Well catch whoevers doing this.  I nodded nervously.  ***  I felt more comfortable knowing someone was outside watching out for me, but my relief was short lived. The cakes stopped showing up at my home, but that didn't mean they wouldn't find their way to me one way or another.  During lunch one day, I heard my co-workers laughing wildly.  Whats so funny? I asked.  One of them pointed to a birthday cake on the lunchroom table.  Go ahead, eat some, fatass, it read.  I spotted the *Just Deserts Bakery* business card from a mile away, and quickly swatted a spoon out of a co-workers hand before he could take a bite. My colleagues looked at me as though I was losing my mind, but I didn't want any harm to come to them. I gathered the pieces of cake that had already been served, tossing them furiously in the trash bin, before doing the same with the cake. When I tried to explain myself, my co-workers refused to listen to me. One of them implied that I was being moody because of my cycle.  Sobbing, I drove home in a car that stunk of sugar. The scent made me nauseous. I could practically taste it now. If I wasn't already crying, the smell alone would have made my eyes water. I rolled down the windows, but it barely made a difference. By the time I got home, I had convinced myself to take the bus for a few days, just so I could get away from the stench.  ***  Rain. I remember waking up to rain. My nostrils were pleased with the odor of wet pavement and squashed worms. I waited in the bus shelter, my legs swinging back and forth as I inhaled the natural aroma of soggy grass. My eyes closed for just a moment. A fleeting second, but as soon as they did, the humid air took on a completely different smell. It was like getting smothered by a box of cupcakes. My head slowly turned to the seat on my right. There it was. A cake.  Get well soon, Karen.  I whined and jumped to my feet, backing away from the dessert that was haunting me. In a frenzy, I failed to notice when my heel caught a crack in the sidewalk. I felt my body falling and heard the screech of tires. The world went black.  This morning, I woke up in a hospital room, surrounded by balloons and an array of beautiful flowers. I couldn't smell them over the stench of sugar that permeated my nostrils. There was a white box with pink curly ribbons waiting for me on the bedside table. Scrawled on the lavender-colored cake, in familiar dark purple script, were the words:  Enjoy your last meal.   nbsp;  [x](https://twitter.com/test_subject2689)   Oh no! Not a telephone!   Summer had always been my favorite season because the warm weather meant I could stop going to the sweaty gym at work in favor of the great outdoors. There was nothing I enjoyed more than cycling on the bike path along the river. Being the creature of habit that I was, I never strayed from the northbound trail. Yesterday, however, I was feeling adventurous, and went south instead. It was a mistake that I will never repeat.  It was a tremendously hot day, the kind where opening the front door felt like putting ones head in the oven. The moment I stepped outside, a wave of scorching humid air assaulted me, forcing me to reconsider my workout schedule. Wiping sweat from my brow, I retreated back into the safety of my air-conditioned home, and decided to wait until evening before heading out.  By 8:00 p.m., the sun's influence was weakening, and the temperature had become slightly more manageable. It was always cooler by the river anyway, so I figured Id be comfortable once I got there and had wind blowing on me. I took to my bike and rode to the municipal park where, as anticipated, the weather was a bit more agreeable.    As I arrived at the junction between the northbound and southbound trails, I spontaneously decided to head left, into uncharted territory. The southbound path was surprisingly pleasant, bringing me nearly to the edge of the water. To my left was a dense forest, whose trees shielded me from the remaining rays of sunlight. Unlike my usual route, this one followed an even mix of flat terrain and hills, providing me with a more balanced workout.  The best part was that, whether due to the weather or the time of day, I was the only person there that evening. It was wonderful: I could go at my own pace without being passed by weirdly competitive riders or having to dodge annoying rollerbladers who never stayed within their lines.  I had just reached the bottom of a hill when the atmosphere suddenly became dense and heavy, like I'd ridden into a tub of jello. At first, I thought I had hit a pocket of humidity, until I noticed the visual distortions. Everything began to warp, as though my contact lenses had been replaced with funhouse mirrors. In my peripheral vision, shadows were twisting and contorting, making them seem alive. A thick fog rolled in from the forest, engulfing everything around me and snuffing out the horizon. If not for an eerie twilight glow emanating from the river, I would have been left in total darkness.  "Don't stop! No matter what, don't stop or you'll die!" a woman shouted in the distance.  Was she talking to me? Who else could she have been speaking to? Id been riding for over an hour and hadnt seen a soul. Im not sure what crept me out more: the warning, the intense pressure, or the unusual optical illusions. Regardless, I wanted to turn back. I gripped my handlebars firmly and attempted to perform a U-turn on the narrow path. However, an unseen force kept my wheels fixed in one direction. Have you ever been in the saucer-shaped ride at the carnival? You lay, untied, to a vertical plank. The saucer starts to spin, pinning you against the plank for the duration of the ride. Thats what it felt like. Try as I might, I could not get my bike to budge because something was pushing my bike to the ground.   I hit the brakes softly, hoping to disembark and turn myself around manually. As soon as I slowed, a sense of dread pierced my heart like an arrow made of ice. The blurry shadows I'd been seeing at the edge of the forest suddenly made a beeline towards me. Their shapes became clearer as they approached. Hundreds of black, clawed fingertips skittered over the grass like giant spiders, leaving the turf yellow and brittle in their wake. The hands seemed both solid and liquid at the same time, as though they could change states on a whim. When they advanced, they did so with the fluidity of corn syrup, yet they still managed to dig themselves into the dirt as easily as a shovel. The hands were attached to narrow arms that extended from the forest like stretched-out bubble gum.  Horrified, I started pedaling, trying to put as much distance between the wretched creatures and myself. It was difficult: it felt like I was carrying three times my body weight in the thick air. It was like pedaling with the resistance maxed out, but without the rewarding boost. No matter how much effort I put in, I advanced mere meters in the effort required to cover a mile.  A low growl bellowed from the forest. Between the greenery, I could see something massive slithering along, following me. The appendages that chased me were all emerging from the single life form hiding behind the tree line. Sweat poured out of me as I desperately tried to pedal farther from its grasp, but exhaustion was quickly winning out over adrenaline. Each time I tried to slow my pace so I could catch my breath, the sickly dark hands threatened to reach me. I kept my eyes on the road ahead, hoping that, if I could just reach the end of the bike path, I would be safe. Unfortunately, it was like chasing a rainbow. Every meter forward pushed the horizon farther away.  It was only when my muscles started to cramp hard and my lungs became enflamed, that I finally gave up trying to run. I had given it all my might, pedaling for an eternity, to no avail. There was no fight left in me. The clawed fingertips came at me like vultures on fallen prey. Fingers shot up and clutched a handful of spokes on my back wheel. They instantly rusted and broke off. I knew I was going to suffer a similar fate. Aching with pain, I hopelessly closed my eyes and braced myself for my demise.  "Now! Run!" said the voice from before.  As though by magic, the overwhelming weight bearing down on me lifted. Gravity had returned to normal. The morsel of hope was enough to give me the strength to jump off my bike just in time to see it consumed by the hands. In seconds, it crumbled into a heap of scrap metal.  "Quick, into the water!" she urged.  I turned to the river, darted towards it, and plunged into the cool liquid while the arms gave chase. The hands stopped at the water's edge, skittering side to side hesitantly. Finally, they snapped back into the forest like elastic bands. I heard the creature scream an ear-piercing howl. The noise was so loud that it caused the water to ripple. I watched in shock as the monsters outline faded in the distance.  I turned to thank my savior, but what I saw made my stomach drop. She wasn't a person, that much I knew. Her head was minuscule and wrinkled, like a barbaric shrunken tribal head. Instead of hair, an uneven mass of kelp hung from her scalp, dangling in front of her pure white eyes. A thin, skin-like film sealed her mouth shut, but the jagged teeth it restrained could easily bite through the semi-opaque layer of flesh in a single chomp. Her half-submerged body was covered in moss, surely hiding horrors beneath. Her webbed hands clutched my shoulders, yanking me into deeper waters.  Screaming for bloody murder, I twisted and thrashed, trying to break free of her grasp, but I was already too weak to change my fate. My screams turned into gurgles as she pulled me underwater. I'd been so stupid to trust her: I was just a French fry shed wanted to steal from the other creatures plate.  It was only a matter of time before I drowned. You hear people talk about seeing their lives flash before their eyes in these kinds of situations. Not me. No, my thoughts drifted to very weird places. Mainly, I worried about how disgusting my cats litterbox was going to get in my absence, wondering how long it would take people to notice I was missing. A day? A week? A month? My house was going to be a mess. Had I vacuumed? Would people remember me as a slob?  Just as I was about to pass the threshold of unconsciousness, I remembered the pocket knife I carried in case of emergency. My numb fingertips caught hold of it, and quickly flicked the corkscrew out. With the very last of my strength, I jabbed the weapon into her hand.  "HYAAARRRGHH!" she screamed, pulling her arms back to nurse her wounds.  My mouth burst open and I inhaled, water pouring into my lungs. Everything went dark.  When I came to, I was on the shore miles away from my city. I'm not entirely sure how I made it back to the surface: whether I was helped, or just surprisingly more buoyant than I thought. I didn't question it, though. I was just happy to be alive, albeit in poor condition. You know that feeling you get when you go to the gym for the first time in years because you made a New Years resolution? That sore feeling in muscles you didn't know existed? I felt that, but ALL over. By the end of it, even my toe muscles were hurting.  I eventually got home, vowing never to take the southbound path again. Though, honestly, I think Ill stick to the gym from now on.   I feel like maybe *just maybe* letting a Coyote eat your spirit animal (and your heart) wasn't *exactly* the best idea...   That's a neat idea. You should try your hand at writing it.   I RPed on AIM when my preferred place was having server issues and/or when someone was having trouble logging in. Ah, those were the days.   I've never actually seen that phrase in a story, but if I ever did, I would definitely click out of it. o_0   Thank you so much! :)   They INSULTED you? Holy cow.  I would highly recommend recording your calls moving forward. I use [ACR](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nll.acr hl=en), a free call recorder.  Anything a representative of Bell tells you by phone is **legally-binding**, even if another agent says otherwise. It'll be a **lot** easier to get your point across if you have a recording of your exchanges.  For instance: John Mc.Johnville tells you you're going to get reimbursed. After two months, you realize Bell still hasn't refunded you. You call them, and Mr. Paul Managerman tells you John wasn't authorized to make such a promise and they can't fulfill it. Well, too bad Paul. John, a representative of your company said it, and you are legally-bound to abide by it.  I bring this up because I had some pretty serious issues with Sears last year and was forced to record my calls to protect myself and force them to respect their agreement. It took 9 months and an email to all the CEOs and chairs of Sears, but eventually, I got my money back.  **Important note**  For legal purposes, if you record calls, you must:  1. Inform the person they are being recorded.  2. Tell the person *why* they are being recorded.  3. Offer a non-phone alternative, IF they refuse to be recorded.  Basically, once they pick up the phone, just say: "Hi, please note that this call is being recorded for documentation purposes."  That's all. If they refuse, offer to communicate by email. The important thing is to have a paper/audio trail.   OK, this isn't one of MY photos, but whiskey tango foxtrot is going on [here](http://img.xooimage.com/files87/4/a/e/crinof-36e59a0.jpg)?! It's a piece of art I came across today called "The Bachelor's Dream".  WHAT'S WITH THOSE DOLLS?! THOSE CREEPY DOLLS. WHAT THE HELL?   Sounds like *you're* the Quebecor here.  As for me, I'm not a big fan of fries, and I don't like cheese. The combination of them is certainly not going to appeal to me.   ;____; I DON'T EVEN LIKE POUTINE!  I'm an Ontarian! My  uh  heart is shaped like Trillium?  	82

    I find the Little Prince a very cutthroat game sometimes!      Obligatory **Castles of Burgundy** and **Trajan** since you like Feldian games.  You can try out **Tzolkin** on boardgamearena before making a decision.  **Panamax** doesn't work well with 2.   I don't think an outsider could do anything much about a sore loser really, except maybe play low conflict or co-operative games.   Maybe keep reminding them, one way or another, that game groups only exist when everyone is having fun.    Fields of Arle actually gives a very different feel from Agricola. If you enjoy the resource management, progression in technologies and personal farm with a relatively low stress level, then Fields of Arle would be a good game for you - there's basically no food pressure. If you enjoy the high stress level, competing for action spaces, and synergising with cards, then Agricola is still the better option.   Decent week for me:  **The Voyages of Marco Polo** x 2 - You know a game is good when you still look forward to the next play after losing badly.  **La Granja** - Interesting mix of mechanics and almost abstract farming.   **Arboretum** - The cards look nice and rules are simple. A decent filler for me.  **Kraftwagen** - Quick playing action selection game that is surprisingly cutthroat. However, the research cards somehow is a bit too random.  **Nations** - My second play. I'm usually a fan of resource management games but  I don't really enjoy this one. For its length, it is too punishing for someone who lags behind, random cards in the new age makes it more tactical/take-that than strategic, and the feeling of progress across ages is just incremental as you are constantly tearing down old buildings. Not sure I would want to replay again.  **Evolution** - Pretty neat idea and simple to play.   **Pandemic: Contagion** - Mediocre light cube pushing game. I don't feel like I'm making meaningful choices in the game.   Have you tried **Quartermaster General**? It's a fast playing 3 vs 3 WWII game that plays under an hour. Easy to pick up, varying player powers for the 6 countries, and surprisingly each game plays out quite differently.   Yes. I was in the exact same position as you last year. I live in the UK and ordered from amazon.de. Just print the rules from bgg.   you spend more time thinking about board games than actually playing them.   Nice collection! We share a lot of similar taste in games. If you are looking for any new games, I'd recommend **Roll for the Galaxy**, **Elysium**, **La Granja** and  **Voyages of Marco Polo**.   I'm a cult of the "new", not in the sense of games that have just released, but in relations to learning new games. I like learning mechanics that are new to me, appreciating clever subtle designs, and discovering  strategies. When playing "old" games with standard strategies, I sometimes find myself on auto-pilot mode. Perhaps I belong in a subset of Cult of the New called **Cult of Discovery**.   Probably good enough for a collection oriented towards low conflict family games. Great for introducing someone to modern board games (see **Catan**, **Ticket to Ride**, **Hanabi**, **Carcassonne**, **Dominion**). However, there will be many types of games the collection will never reach: games with high conflict, games with high stress level and strategy, and games with deceit.   Have you tried **Game of thrones the board game** or **Kemet**? Each player is dealt a hand of cards with different values/attributes, symmetric in Kemet and asymmetric in GoT. The twist is that the cards you use are temporarily discarded and only come back to your hand until you have spent your last (or penultimate, can't remember) card. Therefore, you have to pick your battles.   I taught Marco Polo to about 10 different players. I love how each time I hear how their initial reaction being "this is super powerful, how is this not broken" then after playing switches to "this is actually quite difficult to use".   A fruitful week!  **Voyages of Marco Polo** x 4. Tried out another 4 of the characters, making each game feeling very different. And most importantly, every single player that I have taught the game to enjoyed it too.  **La Granja** x 2. A Feldian farming game! Love the multi-use cards and range of flexibility that this creates. Excited to try out more strategies from the different helpers.  **Roll for the Galaxy** - I love games with low down time so I'm certain this will remain one of my favourite short games.  **Pictomania** - Great fun, especially when players think of abstract and creative ways to draw! Loved the table talk too.  **Dungeon Petz** - a great example of a thematic Euro. Rewards careful planning and risk management. The bidding bit was probably my least favourite part, but it was always fun to make up back stories to the pets you have, which appeals to a group of players who usually couldn't care less about theme.    I would say it's quite realistic. I've played a fair bit (30+ games), and in 4p games usually at least 1 player manages to form a 3rd town. Obviously not as likely in 5p games. Examples of my own:  [Dwarves](http://terra.snellman.net/game/emanova3)  [Mermaids + Darklings](http://terra.snellman.net/game/4pLeague_S6_D7L25_G3)  [Mermaids + Nomads](http://terra.snellman.net/game/4pLeague_S7_D6L24_G7)  [Nomads + Witches](http://terra.snellman.net/game/4pLeague_S7_D6L24_G5)  [Swarmlings](http://terra.snellman.net/game/4pLeague_S6_D7L25_G7)  [Halflings](http://terra.snellman.net/faction/4pLeague_S6_D7L25_G4/halflings/)  [Witches](http://terra.snellman.net/game/4pLeague_S7_D6L24_G2)          Tips:  * It's easier for certain races (Nomads, Witches, Mermaids, Riverwalkers, Yetis) * Be prepared to lose a fair amount of points (10) throughout the game for power leeches. * 3 towns =/= win, as you can see from my examples. * Try to avoid spending 3 workers to dig as much as possible. * Sometimes you have to pass early to secure the bridge next turn.   Ranked by my preference:  **The Voyages of Marco Polo** - Best Euro of 2015 to date. I give credit to the designer's bold choice of radically different player powers. This will be in the top 100 on BGG very shortly.  **Clash of Cultures** - Rock solid tech tree in a civ game. I can see multiple viable strategies. Too bad I always suck at military and defending.  **Kraftwagen** - Neat action selection mechanism in a light Euro setting. I was initially worried about the imbalance of the research cards, but it didn't turn out to be that bad - some suggest a variant of revealing 3 cards instead of 2.  **Goa** - Very interesting bidding system and tech tree. The luck element was slightly annoying in an otherwise fine Euro.  **Patchistory** - Another civ game with a nice patching minigame. The auction mechanism is interesting but it dragged out the game as the bidding process could be quite slow.  **A fake artist goes to New York** - Awesome party game for the end of the night. Probably the best 2,000 yen I spent.   ---Dividing line between good and mediocre games---  **Nations the Dice Game** - Scratches the itch for a 45 minutes light dice driven drafting game. Nothing innovative here so it is not as replayable as **Roll for the Galaxy**.  **Criminal Dance** - a silly party game for non-gamers. Probably more fun with family and children.  **Temporum** - Not particularly interesting card game. Usually there's only one logical choice on your turn.   That's an interesting mix - I have to say it's rare to see players enjoying both Terra Mystica and Elder Sign.  As for Mage Knight, I'd recommend playing it solo at least twice before teaching other players. You will still inevitably get some rules wrong, so even then I recommend playing the co-op version as the first multiplayer game. Oh but it will be a very satisfying and rewarding experience at the end.   If your group has a website (e.g. meetup), it's useful and efficient for players to just prearrange a game.   **The Voyages of Marco Polo** - definitely the highlight of the week. At first there seems to be nothing revolutionary about the game: resource management, worker (dice) placement, route building with secret objectives etc. However, the radically different player powers changes the game entirely. Plus bonus points for variable setup! I can see myself playing 10+ games of this by the end of the year. Instant favourite of 2015.  **Fields of Arle** - Solid resource management game for 2. However, it doesn't feel too competitive, as even in the rulebook it says that this is a "development game". Too much of a sandbox for me. Still prefer Agricola.  **Clash of Cultures** - Awesome civ game. I do love the tech tree, but same as every other Civ game, I lose because I was too trusting to my opponents.  **Glen More** - A light Euro that plays within an hour. Probably best with 3 or 4 as you can plan ahead a bit. Too chaotic with 5.  **Agricola** - A 2p teaching game. Ended up with 53-40 with the help of Woodcutter, Market Woman and Stone Tongs.  **Temporum** - A mediocre card game where players try to be in the right place at the right time....and drawing the right cards.   Wow! Really looking forward to this. Stronghold games has become my favourite publisher. Lots of solid euros: **Kanban**, **Panamax**, **La Granja**, then **504**.   	22

 Haha!   Hahah I'm going to be looking over my shoulder a little bit tomorrow.   How come? I'd love to hear your thoughts.   Haha I agree. It definitely seemed liked it was set in the past.   I would definitely agree with you on that. I also wasn't ever horrified watching the movie. Like I said, I thought the movie created a sense of dread in me while I watched. The score was very original and added to the creepiness of the entire movie experience.   I just saw this movie today and I can't shake the feeling of dread I got from it. The concept of the movie was very original and I thought the movie, for the most part, was well made. Most scary movies these days rely on the jump scares or go overboard with the gore, however It Follows relies on something different. The thought of someone or something continuously walking towards you with the gravest of intentions was certainly unnerving. Has anyone else gotten the chance to see it? What did you all think?

 Or at least the best pickled herring you can get in Indiana.         I make curried butternut squash risotto. Fusion is awesome. I'd try, too.   Bake like crazy.  You can also freeze some, but it doesn't last forever that way. I made the mistake of eating some that had been in the freezer for ~15 months and got food poisoning. Jsyk.   A serving is only one breadstick? How? Why? Life is unfair.   I've found it's also cheaper to buy blocks and shred as needed. Plus you get a mini work out every time you need cheese (which is all the time).   Glad it came through!   Hopefully sent (Dominos gift card).   We have them here in Indiana, too. Probably my favorite chip flavor ever,   My orange boy is named Bill, after the Weasley, obviously. Looks like they both have a lot of paw to grow into.   Indiana. And apparently our laws aren't even close to the worst in the country.   Where do you live that you can stay out that late? All bars here close at 3, cuz you can't buy any alcohol between 3 and 7am.   You're the only person outside my family I've ever seen to call this dish a one-eyed Egyptian. Therefore, you are now officially a member of my family. Congrats, OP! Most of us are functional in our alcoholism!   Thanks!   Thank you!   Basic recipe:  Slice an eggplant into ~1/2 inch rounds.   Lay the rounds on a couple layers of paper towels, liberally salt both sides, cover with a couple more layers of paper towels, and let sit for at least an hour.  After some liquid is drained off, rinse the rounds.  Dip the rounds in beaten egg and then a combination of corn meal, shredded parmesan, garlic powder, and pepper.  Place rounds in greased pans, then into a 350 F oven for ~10 minutes, flipping once, so they get crispy.  In (ideally) a 13x9 baking pan, layer tomato sauce, eggplant, parm, and slices of mozzarella until you've used all your supplies.  Bake in 350 F oven for 25-35 minutes, until eggplant is cooked through and cheese is melty and browned.  Notes:  I used corn meal because my partner in crime has Celiac, so we try to be gluten free.  I used my Dutch oven because I don't have a 13x9 pan, but it was still wonderful.  Making your own tomato sauce would make this even better, but funds and time meant we had to use store bought. Garlic and herb would be great, but we used 4 cheese.  Next time I'd add some herbs, but it slipped my mind.  Edit: I never measure, but about half a block of each type of cheese was used, and we only used one big eggplant. It put 3 of us into food comas.      Panini press because I'm lazy.      I used to do that all the time, too. But then I cut 14" off.   I live in an apartment building. I have been in the same apartment for almost 2 years, and will be staying for a third year.  He moved in last August. He's in the complex across the alley from me. We've been flirting for a year. He's living there again next year.  I've left notes on his door and we've hung out a few times. He knocked on my door yesterday after I left a note and then was too scared to face him for a week. I'm freaking out because he actually wants to get drinks on Saturday, but I'm broke. And I think I'm in love with him. And I have no idea what to do.   Making that hair would be so fun.   Hope you don't like sausage.   It looks like you're increasing too fast. You can't add too many increases in each round. Sadly, I think you will have to frog, but not too far.  Best way to make a flat circle (at least that I've found) is to decrease the number of increases per round by 1, if that makes sense. Like, first round, increase in each stitch, then every other, then every third, etc etc.   Mmmm, pickled herring is the best.   I think that was because of the tapioca flour. They were perfectly cooked, just a little light.   Chips were just thick cut and baked with salt and pepper.  Fish was fairly cheap tilapia coated in tapioca flour, salt, and pepper, then deep fried.  Tapioca flour works really well for fried things. We used it because my partner in crime has Celiac. We just had lemon juice and ketchup with it, because I don't like tartar sauce and she isn't a fan of malt vinegar. Next time we will definitely be trying mushy peas to be traditional, this time one of the people for whom we cooked is a pea hating heathen (but I love her).      Was it alive? If not, it can't hold a candle to gagh.   Okay, I was confused there for a bit. Phew, I haven't been pronouncing it wrong.   Wait, does Heinz rhyme with beans across the pond? Or here? Have I pronounced it wrong my whole life?   Recieved   Recieved!  My fridge died over a week ago, and it finally got replaced yesterday. I'm totally broke because I've had to buy every meal, and even my ramen got thrown out. I'm in Bloomington, Indiana, and some Papa John's would really help me out.   Will? Or just someone with the same porch who also just had a birthday?   http://www.favecrafts.com/Crochet-Afghans/Crochet-Corner-to-Corner-Throw-Pattern-from-Red-Heart-Yarn   Crazy easy and fast!      Reminds me of my [big Mr. Bill](http://www.imgur.com/N3EjiuY.jpeg) .  I went to the shelter with the intent to adopt, and he climbed right into my lap.   Second row from the bottom, third square from left: how did you do that? Did you work two strands at once, alternating which one you used for each cluster? I've never seen a granny square like that.   This style is amazing! And perfect, I think, but I'm not OP.   I'm from the Midwest. Last time I tried them, though, it was in CA. Still icky.   I hate avocados. In every dish.   I'm the opposite, I don't think I'll ever do amigurumi. I made one years and years ago because I got extra credit for it, but it's just not my thing. But, I love making blankets and clothes. Maybe, if I found the perfect pattern, I'd make an amigurumi, but I doubt it.   I use Tupperware or my backpack. No shame.   Not OP, but I've been working on the giraffe by the same person. Each motif takes probably 30 minutes max (I can do 2 for each episode of Star Trek on Netflix). I still have to finish all the motifs, but I'll bet that joining is the hardest part, especially because I'll have to sew a lining for mine.   Rally's. The bacon road house with fries on the sandwich and strawberry Fanta.   Hyperbole is his favorite thing in the whole world ever.   I do, too. Which is why my babies are named Kate and Bill.   Beautiful! I'm happy to see that I'm not the only person who uses Bobby pins as stitch markers, too.   Omg, New favorite sub!   I'm sure you know the basics (wrap yarn around your fingers or a book so many times, slip off, tie round the Middle, cut). How did you mess yours up?  If they weren't round enough, you can trim each strand to work. If they fell apart, get a friend to help make sure the knot is tight enough, and triple knot at least. If they look like a bunch of strands tied together instead of a pompom, wrap the yarn around a few more times.   Ravelry will be your best friend. As for color changes in the same row, look up tapestry crochet.  Once you know how to work two strands at once, graph paper will help you draft your own patterns. Each square is a stitch and each row is, well, a row.   All the pentagons are done, half the hexagons are, then a few more shapes. I'd be done by now if I hadn't run out of the magenta, and weren't broke.   Actually a teacher.      Do you have a pattern? My mom would go crazy for this!   That's why I have some favorites for background noise. All Star Trek, The West Wing, Bomb Girls.  Edit: or you could follow my strategy: learn every language. All of them. Japanese for anime; Arabic for the Qur'an; French for great movies; Russian for Tolstoy....  But I may just be a crazy person, since I'm sad that I'm only almost tri-lingual at 22......   ..... Why Stalin?   More pictures.  http://www.imgur.com/eGkjCeO.jpeg http://www.imgur.com/ijvYVSQ.jpeg  Pattern:  http://alittleloopybutimhooked.blogspot.com/2012/03/spider-web-slouchy-hat.html?m=1  I stopped after the round that starts with a ch11, then took one ch out of each decrease round. I then made the brim with 2 rounds of fpdc/bpdc.      Maybe our laws are less crazy because we have to deal with the fact that we live in fucking Indiana.   The liquor stores here in Btown aren't open past 11pm, but the Kroger can still sell until 3am, since it's 24 hour.   I usually go on Saturdays, I just thought what I had left would tide me over.   But I don't need another reason to move to the Great White North, except for the fact that I hate snow.   Idk if liquor stores have to be state run here, but you can't buy any,even at bars, between 3 and 7 am.  You don't happen to be from Pennsylvania, do you? That seems to be one of the few places with even crazier laws than Indiana.   That's (I think) also true in CA, where my sister lives.   IN also has the strange law that no grocery store can sell cold beer. They're hard core enough that they take sixers into the back of the store to warm up in January, so they won't still be cold from the trucks that delivered them.   You can't buy alcohol between 3 and 7am, and none on Sunday after 3an Saturday night. None till 7am on Monday ,   Nearest one is a mile away. I don't have a car, and they're already closed. #alcoholicproblems   I just want to get a six pack, but Jesus apparently says that I can't. I could find someone to drive 20 minutes to a winery to get a couple bottles, but a) I'm budgeting for 2 handles this week and food, b) the winery is already closed, and c) everyone I know who has a car is also already too drunk to drive.  Jesus made wine out of water. Why does this bass-ackward state have to have these fucked up laws?  Edit: I guess I'm lucky. I thought IN had fucked up laws,   I get motion sick on a plane or in a car, even if I have blinds up. My sister has it worse, as she gets it without trying to focus on a fixed object, like a book. It sucks, but so it goes.   She actually was looking at her favorite toy, which was also in my lap. She was only upset because I wouldn't play fetch with her, because she's a very strange cat.         Absolutely gorgeous, and congrats!  I'm with /u/munchytea I don't even own a working sewing machine anymore, but I'd kill for that dress form.   So jealous of people who can crochet while in a car or on a plane. I get so sick. Yet I'm fine doing it on a boat.   Breakfast food always makes sense.   Basic recipe. I know it isn't at all traditional, but I'm a poor college kid.  Ingredients:  Pork loin  Dry rub (we used salt, pepper, cayenne, garlic powder, and onion powder)  1 bottle hard cider (we used Harpoon, but anything that is a bit sweet will work)  BBQ sauce  Instructions:  Rub your meat down with your rub, let sit for at least 30 minutes.  Pre heat oven to ~190F.  Put meat in a Dutch oven. Pour cider all over and around meat.  Cook, partially covered, until the internal temp is around 150. This took us around 6 hours.  About 2.5-3 hours in, start basting the meat with the cider that's in the pan every 30 minutes.  About 90 minutes before the meat is done, take the cover off and start basting with BBQ sauce every 15-20 minutes.  Take meat out of Dutch oven, let rest for at least 30 minutes. Then, shred with two forks.  Since we used a loin, we had to simmer the shredded meat and extra fat in about half of the braising liquid and some more sauce for 45 minutes to make it moist.  Serve on buns with whatever sides you want. We had mac and cheese and corn on the cob.      It could also be a weather alert.      I'm gonna have to show this to my friend. I just taught her some basics, and this is her favorite color combo (and mine, too).   Moogly is my favorite!   I'm honestly not sure if I can trust someone who thinks jumping out of a plane is a good idea. But I'm debilitatingly afraid of heights.   Mine just climbs on my back and knocks over my water.   Ma'am, good sir. Thank you.   Obligatory inside pics, no flash and flash. Was a tiny bit over done, but amazing, considering two of them was less than $8.  http://www.imgur.com/ThETbDw.jpeg http://www.imgur.com/XJPw4vZ.jpeg  Ninja edit: paired with plain old criminis in butter and a cheap cabernet sauvignon.   Good luck! Thanks, it was just criminis, butter, garlic powder, salt, and a little water to deglaze.   I love that, plus Italian Seasoning, on an everything bagel. Bagel of Doom.      It was toast with laughing cow garlic and herb cheese, pepper, and red pepper flakes. Literally the only food I have besides rice and ice cream. My body could only handle so much.      Congrats, man! I've still got one more year!   Made with water, not milk. Really, I just wanted oatmeal but can't afford it till Friday.   Obligatory first gold post. Thanks, bruh!   Nope, IU.   We had Kroghetto, but now it's Krogentrified.   Yup, Btown representing, only old people call it Krogers.   Southern Indiana here, I've only ever heard old people call it Krogers.      If peanut butter syrup were a thing, that would be the best thing in the world. #Yesistartedputtingpbonoreosafterisawtheparentrap   I also thought about the fact that dried herbs tend to be more potent than fresh ones, but I may be completely wrong.      I brewed random herbs into tea all growing up, since my mom is an avid gardener.  Monarda didyma, with the beautiful deep red flowers was a favorite of mine. It really worked with lavender, too. Lemongrass also makes a great infusion. Straight lavender or chamomile are also good, and exploring all the different varieties of mint is a great starting point (chocolate mint and peppermint are my favorites).  Edit: these all grow very well in Southern Indiana. I always just plucked Monarda flowers and boiled them in water for a few minutes, although I'm sure drying them would make the flavor more intense.   I learned to love spinach because its was "green food," so I could pretend to be one of the dinosaurs from Land Before Time.  Weird kids make the best adults.   Thanks! I'm waiting until the end of the semester to hunt for good loose teas in my town, but I'll keep this in mind.   I'm just getting into tea. I got my first stove top kettle yesterday, and will be getting an infuser soon.  How important is water temperature? And how can you tell that your water is the right temperature (I can only tell "cold," "almost boiling," and "boiling")?   Right now I only have a couple black teas (Earl Grey and a ginger peach flavor) and a couple herbal "teas" (chamomile and peppermint), all in bags.    He never called it a Philly Cheesesteak. Just a steak sandwich.   Plain, old, cheap chamomile with lunch, the last of my really really shitty Lipton style black tea bags later, cuz I've got a late night engagement that I need to stay up for.  Also, hi all! Brand new here, I'll be asking a lot of questions soon, once I finally get a kettle, infuser, and more than one mug.   I'm also new here, but I'd say ask. My favorite tea to ice is Bigelow Constant Comment, which is black tea with orange and cloves and other spices. It's the only tea I prefer with sugar, and it makes the best sweet iced tea.  https://www.bigelowtea.com/Shop-Teas/By-Type/Black/Constant-Comment#.VTTWoMrD_qA   Ooh, I like that idea! Thanks!   Thanks!  Edit: my friend cut it last night when we were both wasted. Almost 14 inches got cut.   Background: I got about a foot cut off last night. I'm growing out the bangs I've religiously trimmed every 2 weeks for 3 years.   I've been dying my hair with henna for just shy of 8 years, but am looking for a color change. I know that red suits me, even though my natural color is the definition of mousy brown. I haven't ever bleached my hair, and have only dyed it unnatural colors twice (all purple about 11 years ago, navy blue tips about a year after), but wanna go crazy, since I'm graduating college next May.  I'm sorry if this isn't the best picture, but I only have my phone.      http://www.tablespoon.com/~/media/Images/Articles/rup/2011/11/2011-11-19-RUP-pecan-pie-ramekins-bowls2-500w.jpg  Little bowls with straight sides.

They do make lab supplies (glass)   Things are so get now.    That thing freaks me out.    Shareholders.    Right? Huge med bills on top off tax penalties for not having insurance.    Digg was right all along then?    Was it cheaper than paying out FDIC?   Pretty sure charter does this.    Quick question, should the argument about minimum wage increase be shifted toward employers giving more hours to employees, rather than a wage increase?   *(Geography is important?)*   But I wanna see Babylon, I wanna see the places my history books spoke of, in person like they did.

This gif got cut off way too early.    50 cent back in the day.    I hit my highest karma on rising.    My school used synthesized Rh, serum, and blood ordered from a lab.    I want him to stop x-posting in smaller subs too. Furthermore, he is to stop x-posting content from smaller subs to bigger ones.

I have no idea man but it doesn't hurt contacting IB.    Get the admins to contact your coordinator. Explain to them what the issue is. They'll have her cell # or something. You have to explain your situation to them.    Talk to the school admins? Maybe she's on vacation?    Do you know if we will be able to view this info on the results webpage?

The curriculum changed so I recommend asking teachers familiar with the new curriculum.    Open your books up, see what you find.    Try Firefox. Cause we used Firefox to upload stuff to ibo   Definitely, you might change your mind about your degree or another reason.    I recommend education, not like a full on degree programs but like a vocational skill. Check out your community college wrists if you are in the US, Europe: no idea. But there's courses that last 6 months or so and you can make above minimum wage like double. Costs for such classes are usually $1000usd.

 Only played two (extremely laggy) games with him, but my initial impression is that he's a total fucking monster. His W is hard to land (might have just been the lag) and maintain, but it deals and heals massive damage, and his Q really wrecks. The E is a decent, though not amazing, escape and chasing tool.  As great as his Q and W are, it's Entomb that's his best ability. It probably needs to be on a smaller cooldown, because it's insanely good. The other Ult is kind of awkward, though it seems okay (especially with the level 20 buff), but it can't touch Entomb.  It's also fantastic never being truly dead. I normally hate death traits (I main Tyrael), but I have to credit the designers for this one. It's awesome not only having something to do while being dead, but also having no travel time once you're back up.  Leoric is super fun, a total powerhouse, and I really like him.                     What? How is what she's wearing asking to be graped?   /r/gogopgo   /r/gogopgo                  Yeah. At that point, "add water" is about your only recourse.         You may be right, but I think he's got real support, and thus a real chance.  We'll see.               She's got a 25 year head start on him. He's put a big dent in that lead in the 2 months that he's been running, which is especially impressive given his resource advantage, and, as you say, [the media is pretty much blacklisting him](https://np.reddit.com/r/SandersForPresident/comments/3dxvft/cnn_made_my_jaw_drop_this_morning/).   By closing the loopholes that allow corporations to make billions in profit without paying any taxes on it. That's a big part of his platform.   That seems to be true, though the fact that he's hugely destroying every other presidential candidate (including Hillary) in rally turnout and individual donation has me wondering why.   How are your private police, fire, military, and roads working out for you? What are the premiums like?   That was hilarious.   He's kind of a big deal.    That's what they all say ;)   Data isn't free. He's simply choosing to conserve his resources in this area. it certainly doesn't mean he's not trying to win.          Many women opt for sports bras for that reason.      It might be a stargate. What if it's a stargate!?   To be honest I'm not sure. I've never ran naked before.   Most nude running events are actually clothing optional, and many women opt for sports bras (and most everyone opts for shoes).                                                         I agree. Gerrymandering and The Electoral College have to go.                                 Note this is not a hasher-affiliated event (to my knowledge). Just sharing it here because it seems to align well the hasher philosophy. Also, I believe some hasher groups take trips to Sunshower together.      Are you maybe thinking of Donald Trump? He paid people $50 a piece to attend his announcement speech.  Bernie doesn't have any significant personal wealth, he's running a very lean campaign, and he refuses to use a SuperPAC. He is definitely not buying crowds. In fact, his platform is centered around stopping people from buying elections.  Check out this interview, if you still think it's possible that he'd pay for crowd attendance:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpgJYNaIeqo                                             I wonder if we could get one of the networks to do a story about this.  Even NPR is largely ignoring him. He gets an off-handed comment every now and then, usually prompted by a caller's question *about* him, but that's about it, and they usually change the topic very quickly.                           Where did you hear that, and how on earth could Sanders afford to buy 10,000 people per event?      /r/gogopgo               I think they announce them a few weeks in advance. Not sure why.  Ohio is a hugely important election state, so he will certainly come here eventually.                                 I do agree that that was kind of silly. The rest of the article is pretty good, though.   Not that late, either, though. I think it's less than 7 weeks after the Iowa primary.   Looks like March 22nd:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_presidential_primaries,_2016  It says "caucus", not sure if that's the same thing. Might want to find a second source to back this up.                                                   /r/gogopgo                        That's Bernie.   Personally, I think he'd dominate in the general. With as many republicans as I see on a daily basis crossing over the isle, and with the way that he's energizing the left (who don't always show up at the polls), I think he'd be pretty unbeatable.  Conversely, I think Hillary is pretty divisive. People either love her or hate her. That said, I think if Bernie can't beat her, nobody can.  So really, I think this election is really all about the democratic primary. In my opinion, whichever one of these two wins the nomination will win The White House.   Thank you for sharing it in the first place :)      Because it's a poll about two progressive candidates. This is /r/progressive.  I'll ask for a third time: how am I, at all, skewing the results for Sanders?                     You're already thinking about his second term. I like that optimism! ;)   I know they're already starting to run into quantum tunneling issues at 10nm. Will the 10nm processors the final generation of processors as we know them, meaning what follows will have to be something new? Or will hardware manufacturers push for even smaller processor components?      /r/gogopgo            It wasn't when I posted it, but now I can't get to it either. Sorry :(.                                                                You are brigading votes for Sanders so that the results so favor him.  Again, how am I "brigading votes for Sanders?" How does asking the question "Would you vote for Clinton or Sanders" in any way favor Sanders?             Then you can use the success in the poll to claim Sanders has actual support  How does this poll favor Sanders?  Furthermore, how can you imply Sanders doesn't have support?                     And that's from Fox. Imagine what the real number is!               It's going to be super fun! I'm really pumped, and a surprising number of my friends agree and are coming with me.   Not sure, to be honest. I'm sure many of the women will opt for sports bras.         Will do.   I, and at least one of my friends, will be walking the 5k, if that helps. Most of the day after will just be relaxing at the resort, too, though there will be swimming and other activities (frisbee, volleyball maybe) as well. These things are typically pretty fun, but there's also a lot of laying around and relaxing, too.  No pressure, though. If you can make it great. If not they might do another next year.     	200

          It's all good.   I figured with his partial nudity, the NSFW tag was a safe bet.      If you'd like to check the website http://www.dominos.com I'm sure you'll find my spelling to be accurate.     Domino's doesn't have an "e" in it.   Looks like a steak and a side of mashed potatoes.      Amen dude. I couldn't have said it better.   I clean the ovens every other Sunday at closing. Last time, I came in and there was a well proofed pan about to be thrown out. (We throw out unused pan pizzas at close of day). I grabbed the pan and poured a little bit of butter, cinnamon, and powdered sugar all over it. Put it in the oven 1.5 times. Poured sweet icing all over it after I cut it. Let it cool. Became the physical incarnation of diabetes.   I remember when me and my sister were young, we used to jump from one bed to another but we'd be either jumping in slow motion or "floated" across. My sister remembers it too. It's so strange. It felt so real.   That's the same guy on the gas pumps here in Mississippi.   I'd throw a party. No one would show up as usual.   "Our Purge" Ted kills retired Bob Kelso. Carla kills "young Carla". J.D. violently tortures and kills the janitor. Turk and Cox compete on who can carry more bodies to the morgue. The Todd kills all the women (except for young Carla).   I have that kind of thing happen way too often. I didn't know it had a name. I've never had any luck on Google. Thanks for the link.   I'm stuck with a bunch of twenty something's (people my age) that frequent central perk and drink coffee all day. While I wonder where they get the money to afford to sit around all day since I rarely see them at work.   A tier one MTG deck(mainly because I don't feel like building another one), a bottle of The Glenlivet 21 year old archive and a pound of weed butter.   Really late but I believe in this instance we should get to see the date that Dr Cox and Carla went in that is mentioned in "My Quarantine". Asking with other little things that were "remembered" by the senior staff.   My little brother used to play in blender boxes   Same here. I don't get it.   When Jesse is walking up to his newly purchased house and his dad tries to stop him and Jesse reveals the keys. Epic!   Stay at the Tower on earth. Hang out in the hangar with Dead Orbit.   Fuck Walmart too   I don't do that but my phone didn't come with headphones. LG G3 BTW.   http://imgur.com/jthenyr   If there's ever a movie or TV series about Gustavo Fring, some of this should be the trailer. Not all of it. Just some parts.   The store near me has cart returns but the people hired to get the carts are responsible for stray ones throughout the lot. It varies from store to store. Not saying it's right to leave them about.    Lol. Love the reference.   Do you also offer a chocolate covered pretzel?   I do this anytime I have to get up before noon.   I had that problem and now I use flushable wipes.   Awesome. I love that song   Like in the Merle Haggard tune?   Yeah thanks   Cool   Thanks   Late as hell but I truly hated him when he fucked things up with Gus. That was a great opportunity for everyone involved. Why fuck it up?   Nothing. I'm the supplier of the $100,000,000,000   For some reason, I knew that. Like, in the back of my head.   I discovered this song on my classic country station on Pandora. I can't figure out why, but I really enjoy this song. I only have one question (I'm not a trucker and don't know any so I don't understand the lingo) what's he mean by "bear"? Is he talking about actual bears or is this code for something?   No. But thanks anyway.   Thanks so much! I appreciate it. I'll try it after work   Here's your pizza. I hope you tip.   I recently bought the LG G3 and the default texting app doesn't appear to let me set individual notification sounds for each contact.  I did some research and found Textra. I like Textra but when I tried to send or receive a picture message (MMS), the app is telling me it can't detect MMS settings. I'm guessing it means APN info.  I did further research and tried a few APN URLs with no luck. It's stuck, not failing or succeeding.  Does anyone here know the APN for the MMS  protocol?   I used to play this one. It was super fun   I completely forgot about those games.   Dude. That game. That sound track. The memories.   It's a tie. Zelda a link to the past and super Mario All Stars (yes, all four).      In two words "twenty fourteen".   Not gonna work... Refer to the image.   Lol  	54
 He's waiting for NOVAA   The following is a transcription of an audio tape found in an abandoned prison, around a dozen bodies.  ---  March 2nd, 1965. 5:00 pm. My senior year of High School.   Getting plenty of sleep, I presume? he asked me. The cool spring air drifted in from the window, diminishing the intense heat that plagued the office. Sweat dripped off of the doctors long nose as his mouth fidgeted, appearing to chew on something that wasnt there. His eyes flew from his paper, to me, to Anna, and back to the paper. His irises were dark enough that you couldnt tell for the life of you where the pupil ended and where the mock color began.  Yeah, plenty I responded. Anna made eye contact with me, as she knew that was a lie. By that point in my life, sleep wasnt high on my list of priorities. I worked the night shift to collect enough money to get by, and my ability to stay alert during those hours was fueled purely by caffeine and horror stories. I wished that I could get more, but if I still wanted to be able to go to college next year, rest wasnt an option.  Are you two, uh, sexually active in any way? Dr. Lanius questioned, glancing down at his clipboard, then quickly at Anna, then back at me.  No, not yet, I replied. Anna and I had only known each other since Sophomore year, and right from the start I would have given my life to protect her. I asked her out a month after we met, and wed been dating since.  Ah, I, uh, why dont you tell me a little, uh, more about your relationship? His breathy voice was getting on my nerves. My parents urged me to come to the doctors office at least every six months, something that I was ordinarily fine with. However, the latest addition to the roster of physicians, Dr. Lanius, had begun to irritate me.  I dont think thats anything you need to know, I said sternly, standing up and reaching for my jacket. Every visit Id had with him, Lanius had proceeded to ask more and more personal questions, and by now, I was fed up.  Ah, yes, yes, yes, youre probably right, you can go now he muttered after staring at me. Turning his gaze to Anna, he said See you both back soon.  As I walked out of the room with Anna, I looked back to see Lanius staring at us, his fingers tapping madly against the clipboard. I yanked the door shut behind us, stampeding my way out of the office.  Would you like to schedule a later appointment? called the receptionist as I sped past.  No, thank you, I replied, pushing my way past the doors and into the open. The snow around us was just beginning to melt away, giving the air a cool and crisp smell. The trees had yet to grow their leaves, but the grass was already green and blooming with life. In a couple more months, summer would be upon us. I felt Anna pulling at my hand, and turned to look at her. She had long blonde hair and green eyes, and a smile that could have stopped a missile if she had wanted, or stopped the stars if she was willing.  William, he was just asking what he needed to ask, she pleaded with me.  Yeah, I know, I replied, but it just seems like he wants to know so much about us. After a while I stop being comfortable with that.  Im sure itll be fine, Anna grinned, Now, you promised me wed go to see The Sound of Music today. Unable to resist her smile, I led her to my car.  ---   June 2nd, 1965. 4:00 pm.   The sun pounded down on us as we walked away from school. There was only about a week left until school got out, and just two days until the Friday Dance. Cars out of the parking lot of the school behind us, blasting tunes from the Beach Boys. Anna would sing along for the word or two she remembered before returning to discussing her plans for Friday. All I could think about, however, was the hours I would be awake for tonight.  My blue eyes had dark bags under them from the lack of sleep, and my dirty blond hair was getting greasy. It wasnt an attractive look, but in a few months, I would be at college and it would all be better. At least, I hoped it would. I was running low on horror stories, and Im fairly certain that I was addicted to caffeine.  The sweltering heat surrounded us as we turned the corner, walking past a black van as Anna went on about the dress she was going to wear and I wished I were in bed. There were only four blocks of identical suburban houses left before we got to my house, but I would always walk Anna four more to her house, to make sure she would get home safely.  I looked around, taking in our surroundings. The trees stood still due to the lack of a breeze, and the sky emanated life, without a cloud in it. A red Buick whizzed down the street, and a black van took its time behind us. At least if I had to toil through the nights, I could live for the days.  Hey, said Anna, Lets play I Spy, okay? You go first.  Alright, I laughed, I spy with my little eye a tall, green object.  A tree, she giggled, cmon, thats not even hard. Let me show you how its done. I spy with my little eye something square.  I stopped and looked around for a square object, my eyes passing over a black van that was slowing down next to us. I glanced over at the nearest house before my eyes snapped back to the van. Grabbing Annas hand, I slowly started walking down the street. The van sped up behind us. I started walking faster, scanning for a road we could take that wouldnt let the van through. Unable to find any means of escape, I started running, pulling Anna behind me. Suddenly, she dropped to the ground, pulling me down with her. I attempted to sit up, but found myself unable to. My eyes closed, and fell asleep. I was equal parts terrified and relieved that I was getting some rest.  --- June 2nd, 1965. 6:00pm.   I rolled over, refusing to get up. The alarm hadnt gone off yet, meaning I at least had a few minutes more to rest. I didnt want to open my eyes and break the spell. Suddenly, I heard Annas voice.  William, William, please, get up, she whispered, I dont know where we are but your Doctor is here andIthinkyouwererightabouthimohWilliam. She spoke so quickly that her words blended together. I sat up quickly, almost immediately awake. We were in a dark and cold room, with almost no moisture in the air at all. I was laying in a bare-bones prisoners cot, and Anna was pressed against me, terrified. We both wore nothing but blue patients outfits. Across the room, Dr. Lanius sat with his legs spread apart and his hands on his knees. He was wearing a set of green scrubs, and his mouth and nose were hidden behind a surgeons mask.  Old sawbones has a few tricks up up his sleeve, it appears, he muttered, in a voice just loud enough for it to echo around the room and into the hallway, Now, do follow me. Or you could stay here and wait the Nurse to prep you, but that might be a long wait.  He giggled to himself, amused, and then stood up slowly, and started walking down the hallway. He stopped, looking back at us, and motioned for us to come along. We both sat as still as statues for a moment, and then I got off of the cot, and took Annas hand. We followed Laniuss slow saunter down seemingly endless twists and turns before arriving at a metal balcony overlooking a room full of what appeared to be corpses. Anna put a hand to her mouth as we walked in, and I squeezed her hand. I would get her out of this.  You see, Ive been conducting these experiments on the effects of sensory deprivation on the mind, said Lanius, facing the bodies, but unfortunately, adults arent very good at conveying their emotions. After many attempts to make them say what they felt, I realised they were no good. So, Ive turned to what I believe to be the perfect solution. Why not use angsty teenagers? Theyre all about emotions, arent they?  As he said the last phrase, he turned to the two of us, looking as if he expected a response. When he didnt get one, he turned back to the dead, and was about to begin speaking when one of the dead interrupted him:  HELP! cried the man, completely motionless, except for his mouth, I - I CAN SEE HER, I CAN SEE HER, AND SHE WANTS TO CATCH ME, HELP!  Anna cried out and turned to run, but Lanius held out his hand and stopped her. I held her close to me, and when I did, I could feel myself trembling.  Hes not dead, began Dr. Lanius again, hes merely experiencing extreme sensory deprivation. I tried placing them in sensory deprivation tanks, but that didnt produce the data I needed. So, I went to the extreme. First, I gathered some volunteers who were willing to help, and then I performed the surgery.  The basis of the surgery is the severing of nerves. I leave the needed nerves untouched, such as the ones that keep the heart beating or the lungs breathing. But the nerves that allow people to move, or feel, or see, or smell, or hear, or any of that - those are gone. They cant feel or see anything from outside. They are quite literally trapped inside their minds.  At this point a woman interrupted him, weeping, and asking for someone to kill her. Dr. Lanius remained silent, and another man stated how he didnt know if he was alive or dead, and several more proclaimed that something was chasing them, or that they could see loved ones.  Ive left it so they can still speak. They dont have any haptic feedback from it, though. They can talk, but they wont feel themselves talking nor hear themselves. Ive got them all set up with Tape Recorders, so I can listen to what they say, Lanius elaborated, I tell them going in that I want to hear about what they feel, but every one of them quickly descends into asking for death or saying theyre seeing someone. I feed them, clean them, keep them free of waste, all so one of them can tell me how they feel. But I never get it, do I?  Dr. Laniuss entire demeanor had changed from when I would go to the doctors office. He was cold and calculated, and didnt stutter or second-guess a word he said. But one thing remained the same - he kept stealing glances at me and Anna.  Lanius proceeded to spend the next several hours informing us of the procedure, as we sat mortified, unable to speak a word. He went on and on about how he severed the nerves and how he kept the people he operated on alive afterwards. It was several hours later when he glanced at his watch and told us that it was time for rest. He led us back to the place where we woke up, and closed the door behind him without locking it.  Hes killing them, I said to no one in particular.  Hes doing worse than killing them, said Anna in a hushed voice, hes torturing them for the rest of their lives.  We both sat in silence for what seemed like hours. Eventually, Anna laid down on the cot, but I knew she wouldnt be asleep for a while. I felt like we both knew what was going to happen to us, but I had the solace that at least we would be doing it together.  I then started to think about the people. The tortured people, kept in that room, kept in their heads for what could be a certifiable eternity. Unable to move or feel for the rest of their lives, unable to know if anything is real or not. Being buried alive seemed like nothing compared to what awaited us.  I guess I knew, in that moment, that no matter what was going to happen, I was going to end up laying there on that table, as still as the grave, talking maybe to no one, maybe to everyone. If I was going to spend the rest of my life that way, I was going to spend the time I had left saving people from that fate.  Quietly, I got up and moved towards the door. I gently pushed it open, and cringed as it creaked open, its metal hinges grinding on more metal. I followed the twists and turns of what must have been a prison, with our room being a cell, and the room of the barely alive dead being a mess hall. As I arrived there, I crept down the metal staircase and towards the bodies.   Amidst their shouts and whispers wishing for death, I found the woman who was crying earlier, asking us to kill her. I pulled the tube out of her mouth, and watched as she slowly choked on a lack of air, unable to feel herself doing it, trying to ask me to kill her the whole time. Her sightless eyes open and closed as she retched, attempting to say kill me, incapable of knowing I was doing just that. After a moment, her shaking stopped, and she was gone, freed from her torture.  I moved on to the next body, yanking the tube of air out of his mouth. I didnt wait for him to pass before moving on to the next, going on a spree of euthanasia to free the undead from their torture. I pulled the plug on the last one, and turned to see the clock on the wall strike twelve. Standing underneath it was Dr. Lanius, watching me destroy his work.  ---  June 3rd, 1965. 12:03am.   You son of a bitch! yelled Lanius as he tossed me into a cell, opposite of the one where I could see Anna, sitting up from the cot and staring at the scene.  That was my lifes work! We could have, as the human race, have achieved immortality! The ability to truly be free! I just had to know what to do to the bodies to make the people happy! And you ruined it!  Dr. Lanius pulled out a keychain, and proceeded to almost lock the cell door before reconsidering. He grabbed Anna by the arm and me by the scruff of the neck, and dragged us with him. His strength surprised me for the squirrelly old man he had always seemed to be.  He pulled us into a room that was devoid of anything but a skylight, through which moonlight radiated in. Stars filled the night sky, and I attempted to take a snapshot of that sight, in case I was unable to ever see again. Lanius saw me staring and grabbed my head, now forcing me to look out of the window.  Do you think anyone out there is coming to save you? he hissed, Do you think anyone out there even cares about you? No, theyre too preoccupied with their brand new Vietnam war and their race against the Soviets to control the sky! Youre worthless, and you worthlessly destroyed years of work and research, and made it all worthless, you worthless son of a bitch!  You destroyed their lives, I responded, trying to stay calm, They didnt want to live out the rest of their days like that.  Oooh, you want volunteers, do you? Lanius asked. He grabbed Anna and threw her on the floor. How about this. Lets make a deal. Either she gets to go free, or you get to go free. How about that, huh? You volunteer as my new test subject, or you volunteer her as my new test subject! How about that, huh?  Anna looked absolutely terrified, just about as terrified as I felt. Lanius had gone completely crazy, and was yelling, when before all he would do was talk just loud enough for you to hear.  Soooo, Mr. Worthless. Who is it going to be?  I looked up at the stars, and then back down at Anna. I thought of the moon, and then of her smile. The smile that could stop a missile. The smile that could stop the stars.  Take me, I said.  ---  Date Unknown.   You ever wonder if the hero of a story questions whether the decisions he made were the right ones? I do. I cant tell whats real anymore, and whats my imagination. This could have happened in hours, or in days.  I dont know anything, really. All I know is I need to talk, and hope my story is heard.  I dont know if he actually let Anna go.  I dont know if it was worth giving my life for hers.  I dont know anything. Im just lost in my mind.  ---   Date Unknown   I sometimes wonder how long it will be before I forget things. I cant hold on to every memory forever. But I feel I have to. Im trapped in a prison of memories, far worse than that cold cell. Once I lose my memories, what do you think I will be?  I sometimes wonder if theres someone here. If I was rescued, and if Im in a hospital right now, about to be cured.  I sometimes wonder if I was rescued and there is no cure.  I sometimes wonder if I will ever be rescued.   Happy Cake Day, and yes, support has ended for it. I'm thinking at this point I might as well go and update it, because of that very reason.   Yeah      Oops, my bad. Failed to scroll down that far on the side xD   \o/      You tried Refined Relocation?   Nope, we've done all we can. It's on Pahimar's side. All of our issues have been on the github for a while, just waiting on him.   Nickel and Platinum do not spawn. I know there's a recipe that needs platinum with OpenModularTurrets (oversight on my part), but is there anything that you actually need it for?   Swamp Thing is the first PBN song   The transition music between Haywyre and Porter was Halsey - Ghost (Lost Kings Remix)   Vanilla+ is designed for scenarios like this   Probably not. There's not anything stopping you from adding it yourself, though. Just keep in mind that we probably won't support issues you have unless you can reproduce it w/o added mods.  (also you may want to delete the ae2 config file if you do add it)   I sort of rewrote the pack halfway through. Original modlist:  http://i.imgur.com/Yry0BZP.png  It was more based around Thermal Expansion and AE2 - but considering most of the complaints from the original Horizons involved having those two mods, I decided to re-do it to involve Mekanism and etc. The goal was to avoid any gameplay mods in Infinity, unless they had a sufficient number of addons. AE came close to making it back in, but it's been in almost every FTB pack since it was released.   If it doesn't get added to Infinity, I'm going to add it to Horizons.   Which version are you running?  Also, it's probably related to this issue: http://forum.feed-the-beast.com/threads/1-0-0-galacticraft-oil-acting-like-items-we-can-pick-up.95531/   Mekanism, Engineer's Toolbox, Aura Cascade, and EssentialCraft III all have Ore Doubling mechanisms.   Not to mention adding a variety of RFTools, such as a [block protector](https://github.com/McJty/RFTools/wiki/RFTools-Block-Protector), [a crafter](https://github.com/McJty/RFTools/wiki/RFTools-Crafter), [screens](https://github.com/McJty/RFTools/wiki/RFTools-Screen), [a spawner](https://github.com/McJty/RFTools/wiki/RFTools-Spawner), [a power relay](https://github.com/McJty/RFTools/wiki/RFTools-Power-Relay), [modular storage](https://github.com/McJty/RFTools/wiki/RFTools-Modular-Storage), and so much more. Direwolf actually has spotlights on all the things from the mod, and I recommend watching them. It's so much more than just the dimension builder.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMmto9lZi5I  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TRWl7PC8uDE  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcBGqATJulY   What is the average airspeed velocity of an unladen swallow?   Extra Utilities and Mekanism both offer methods of RF transport, along with a somewhat complicated way using Aura Cascade.   You can actually charge stuff straight from the Mekanism Energy Cubes   Clockwork Phase probably has the best early game tools, and as for the most complex tech trees, you'd probably go for Mekanism. Aura Cascade and EssentialCraft III are both really in-depth magic mods that you should also definitely check out if you've got the time.  As for automated mining, you've got Mekanism, Extra Utilities, Essentialcraft III, and even Blood Magic to help you out there :)   Yup. It'll take a while though, due to some backend stuff. Not much we can do to speed it up.   Generally the goal was to not have any mods that were in Infinity in this pack. Obvious exceptions being things like NEI or Chisel. Blood Magic made it in purely on account of it's addons.   They obviously loved my beautiful un-customized Twitter background.   Oops! Well, it certainly is new to FTB, to say the least.      \_()_/   What is the average airspeed velocity of an unladen swallow?   Oh my goodness, I would love to get my hands on a mod that does this. Obviously not for legitimate use, but I love the style it gives the cities.  	32
 droid all the way.  I own both.. prefer droid.    idk, its kinda handy knowin where hurricanes are and where they are heading.. and that gps thing is so niffy they put it in everyones pockets.   LMAO dude.    I'm low on grain, made too many mines, not enough farms... i got wood though, but then again you knew this.  ;)   The key, of course, is to never accidentally an entire pot.   If you want to enter but are struggling for something to say, just share what juice you are currently vaping  homemade is the best way. Though i do have way way way too many flavor bottles. and most the labels are worn off.  still i like to be able to make low nic for day time, and high nic at night.. and have some super high for more stressful times. making it at home makes this easy, otherwise i would have to buy 3 to keep up wiht my styles.         That doesnt make sense for the paragraph.  Are the people with other jobs not volunteering as well?  or is it just sex workeers    So why pay for hetero sex when you can get the homo kind for free? is that the ticket?.... but but if homo sex is legal, wont there be homo sex workers?  They really arent competing in the same market.. besides for the fence sitters. I mean if the homosexual prostitutes had a 50% off sale... i would still pay ~~ore~~ more for the hetero, cause that's what i am into... now if the homo sex was 75% off then... hmmm maybe.    most have some sort of marking.. bumps are better for sure.. but in the next couple years, it wont mattr, due to reversable usbs coming out    But that doesnt mean it cant be fixed. They are driven to this by the nature of things.      They and others were pushed into it. For a couple reasons.  Annoying ads.  click bait.   A stripper once told me, being respectful is all and go, but sometimes you got to swallow your pride to put food on the table.(she was talking about how she hates stripping)  ok annoying ads helped kill wire, cause so many wire users are now on ad block. No I am not saying wired had these ads.. the net did. But the point is the wire earns less money per visitor than it could had the net not had annoying ass ads driving people to adblock or ublock as people prefer today. I really wish the 'free market' would do something about the annoying ads cause they are effecting all sites, including reddit. aka dont do business with companies that use them or ad companies that make them.  Your trying to survive, you aint making shit cause of ad block.. and then you see this other site getting hits after hits with its stupid stories "can having a dog keep you from getting cancer?"... "there are 12 things in your home that could be killing you right now, click here to find out" and its all on 14 pages of click throughs...and you find this site with its trash stories is raking in the money and while you spend money trying to get good stories...arent... so you turn to click bait.   really and I know a lot wont like this, but since the free market isnt bothering to fix a problem that effects everyone, then maybe some ads need to be regulated. I dont like this idea at all either. It would be a tough law.. and most likely our congress would rather block adblock than the problem. But if every single site had static ads.. that dont make noise.. i wouldnt use ublock. And the wired of the world could make maximum potential per visitor      Correct me if i am wrong, but it sounds a bit different when you say chronically alternating light cycles, versus poor sleep.  I also have heard that certain spectrums can effect our serotonin/melatonin cycle, so this test makes me wonder if a it might be the lights and not the lack of full sleep. And wonder if changing spectrums for people who have to have weird hours could help.      Nope.  Guy split from the klan, made his own klan called the rocky mountain knights. The rockey mountain knights are the ones that opened up. John Abar also didnt found the KKK, he founded the rmk.  [That article was just crap reporting](http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2014/11/03/inclusive-kkk-montana-chapter/18406129/)   and [the "real" klan..got mad. ](http://www.haaretz.com/news/world/1.626315)    gooooood luck with that.. how long has it been going on? nearly 2000 years now.. most of their persecution history is about as real as the war on christmas.    This community is horrid to ask a question or post anything in. (unless it is an complain about  perk lowering payments post)   My theory is age range for the sub, that this sub skews younger than most reddit and that includes some of the sillier subreddits.  edi: point proven.. thanks. Yall really do make this subreddit unhelpful and hard for people to ever approach. Downvote away, yall are still childish assholes that make this subreddit suck for most people.     Its a bit overly snarky and douchy.(and dont get me wrong, anti vaxxors are dangerously stupid, and harm more than their own) I mean if you want to win people over...It reads like a bunch of reddit comments jammed together.  it also burns some strawmen and lumps various groups together. Not all anti vaxxers are into alternative medicine.   Not all anti vaxxers think 'mom is right', some think that one stupid doctor with his one retracted study was right.  the article also pretends anti vaxxers are all liberal, and while there are some noted ones, [its actually more a conservative thing.](http://www.publicpolicypolling.com/pdf/2011/PPP_Release_National_ConspiracyTheories_040213.pdf) which 22% of conservatives and 12% of liberals.. the point isnt politics, but if your writting this for some goal in mind either to educate the skeptic or make fun of the anti vaxxer, well you got to get this right.   3 is comfirmation bias.. which infects a fuck ton of people.. even einstein.   I'm not going to go through this all. I agree anti vaxxers suck but this article wasnt that much better.    thats trashist   The scariest part was when he got up... ["just one look, i dare you"](http://i.imgur.com/WL2LdMe.jpg)   "we are a christian nation.....now lets put a bunch of graven images of people on our bills"  er..   there are strifes between the people but yeah. Jewish people are respected on the quran and israel already has had sunni allies from egypt and jordan. They also have been increasingly allied with the sunni world since 2009. SA supported israel in their attacks on Hamas.   so.. its not as cut and dry as you might think.  the middle east is also only a small part of the islamic world. The majority of asian muslims are sunni's and they have no problem with israel.    i dont disagree but why was this replied to me?   one of these days we might prove some of the crazier shit you hear from some advocates. (I was in NORML, sorry but there are some that go a bit overboard on unproven claims...well some formerly unproven)    I do think its both the pnacrs and the pro settlement people who are the most against the deal.  lets pretend, in happy BS land, that all the middle east went peaceful.. and they all heaped praise on israel...think israel would start to support removing any settlements? Honestly support a completely peaceful and disarmed palestinian state? no they wouldnt. you dont build permenant structures on land you might give back.    Here they are [gandy dancing a rail road.. at lake murray SC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TzSSzLGl8M feature=youtu.be t=41)  notice how little they move that thing.. think about the miles and miles, they had to do.   The best is to design the place where people only feel comfortable at a slower speed. Though that can piss people off quite a bit.  still there is tangential evidence that while changing speed signs have no effect, they do when they dont end in 0 or 5 as people actually notice them.    We do need to call these people out and make fun of them. its ridiculous. And not just this idiot, same with the people who think the minion dollars are telling them to fuck off.. which they REALLY SHOULD.  no seriously this is 2015, not 1812. We know how this works, and went through this shit in the 60s. The human mind is pattern orientated. Thats why we see smillie faces in the clouds and hearts on pluto. Its also why people heard satanic messages when you played records backwards...  its also very internal, i bet none of you saw 666 until you read it and then looked at the feet. It just wasnt in your mind, like it was in this lady's and now thats probably all you can see.  like the minions. i couldnt tell what they were saying until someone told me what they were saying and then thats all i could hear.  did they make the minions tell me to fuck off? NOPE, same with this cake, costco isnt playing a joke, or hiding satanic messages.  Its our minds trying to make patterns out of chaos.  Someone should tell this woman that she is a human being and then send her on her way. Perhaps though, we shouldnt tell her that the 666 is coming directly from her mind and not from the cake.  (but seriously, we shouldnt make these news stories that sounds like a he said/she said and either could be correct.. no we need to make fun of them and point out that science says people do this and they are just hearing/seeing things.. it wasnt real in the 60s and it isnt real in 2015)   I was thinking of [getting this one for the car 15000mah](http://www.newfrog.com/p/15000mah-multi-function-car-jump-starter-mobile-power-bank-charger-95322.html?utm_source=BBS utm_medium=reddit utm_campaign=products) but i worry a bit, as All the similar ones are twice as much. (the youtubes show the same style, working well to jump cars)     fair enough but his question was seeking answers for his own setup.  being literal is fine but he was seeking help and not necessarily taking a survey. But hey, maybe he has a spreadsheet with your name in column A and "takes spare batteries" in column B.  :P  Instead of giving him what he asked, I gave him what he needed.      That might be too cool. Have to teach our kids not to disarm themselves for cool prosthetics.  and to change the tone, I do wonder how it will change, this kids life. Old style prosthetics could be off putting for children, where these would invite children to talk to him.    Not a scientist but I'll make an educated guess.  its based on the probabilities on how often pluto should get hit, versus the lack of impact craters.  I forget how old they said, 200k years i think, so in 200k years there should have been at least 1 impact site(even likely more but at least 1) and since you see none, it has to be less than that old.    Not sure why people saying carry more batts, since you got the xpro.. that would be a second mod.  You can get a [portable power charger](http://www.amazon.com/AmazonBasics-Portable-Power-Bank-000/dp/B00LRK8JDC).. there are some that can jump your car as well.

If you repost, include if you are on wifi and if you can download firefox with internet explorer    wait!?!?!  men have nipples? why?!?    nope.. he was correct. He has the right to sue.. and if he loses, he will pay court costs. You just disagree with the unsaid meaning behind his comment, which is totally different.  I'm also not as sure as you that he will win. We do it all the time. And as of today the 18th, AFTER the kkk rally, we still havent had a judge issue an injunction.      not without limits.. PLAIN AND SIMPLE.. even SC has limits.  The question is whether the law that forbids cities from enacting laws in conflict with the state, can do so for temporary and emergency reasons. I dont think he will win.  The state cant tell me how much i can sell a gallon of water for. if someone wants to buy it for $200.. so be it.. but if we get hit by a hurricane, suddenly the state can. The law gives leeway during emergencies and one could argue the upcoming protest was an emergency situation.  I dont have a dog in this race but, I'm definitely not going to be absolutely sure how this will be ruled. WE have a fuck ton of limits to guns even in SC.     they arent really passing an ordinance but an emergency temporary measure.. I'm not so sure he will win. It would be different if it was permanent. There is a lot of leeway when its an emergency and temporary measure.   one of the safest places on the planet to live.....  and american supermax prison. Everyones monitored. Movement highly controlled. Mail is read. You wont get robbed or stabbed in a supermax. And its the scummiest, most dangerous neighbors you can have.(yeah I am sure someone can find an incident at a super max, but for the most part, we have closed all the holes that you see in normal prisons and they are the safest place to live.. especially considering the danger of your neighbors)  But i dont want to live in a supermax. Almost no one does.  So just saying "you will be less safe..without.." is meaningless, without the other half "you will give up..." (privacy, freedom, w/e)  If you want super safe, lock everyone in individual steal bubbles, ship food in through a tube...no one wants that.. so blow it your your ass about "thousands of lives"  (and shhhhh this is the big BS key about all this.... notice when gobberments get hacked, what do they do next?

WOW.)   Nexen is apologizing for a pipeline break that leaked five million litres of bitumen  this is bitumen.. it makes oil look like dish soap. This is what they wanted to send through keystone. Its nearly impossible to clean up.  it used to be called garbage crude back before we sucked up all the sweet stuff. It really is horrible stuff.  the pipelines are more likely to break because the bitumen has to be heated to high temps just so it can flow.      apparently he forgot to tell himself.  Amazing all these "not a scientist but global warming isnt true" folks, get so bent out of shape and yell "your not a scientist" to people who also arent scientist but say global warming IS true.  Mind you these are some of his comments  .Some of the hysteric and extreme claims about global warming are also a symptom of pagan emptiness, of Western fear when confronted by the immense and basically uncontrollable forces of nature. Belief in a benign God who is master of the universe has a steadying psychological effect, although it is no guarantee of Utopia, no guarantee that the continuing climate and geographic changes will be benign. In the past pagans sacrificed animals and even humans in vain attempts to placate capricious and cruel gods. Today they demand a reduction in carbon dioxide emissions.  ok AGW is a pagan thing.... but he says the church needs to be separate from the science and let  the science do its thing.. but he claims it is a religion thing. How can the pope NOT comment, when this cardinal says its all pagans?  and he also said.  Radical environmentalists are more than up to the task of moralising their own agenda and imposing it on people through fear. They don't need church leaders to help them with this, although it is a very effective way of further muting Christian witness. Church leaders in particular should be allergic to nonsense..... I am certainly sceptical about extravagant claims of impending man-made climatic catastrophes. Uncertainties on climate change abound ... my task as a Christian leader is to engage with reality, to contribute to debate on important issues, to open people's minds, and to point out when the emperor is wearing few or no clothes.  hes a church leader... saying AGW is bullshit but demanding other church leaders, not get involved and def never say AGW is real. how does that even work either?  This cardinal is so stereotypically right wing, its almost racist. ;) (yeah the right isnt a race) but its akin to right winger christians in america wanting all these exception laws, whose heads would explode if muslims wanted the same.  This right winger wants to let the church deny AGW, but gets pissed off when the pope supports it?  and how the fuck can he publicly challege the pope as a catholic? this is another difference with progressives. A lot of progressives didnt like the last pope. But they didnt come out and do this crap.         I have never seen a church, besides scientology, that charges a fee in the US. maybe I am wrong.. been to baptist, catholic, episcopal and presbyterian.. now they do more than encourage tithing, but have never seen one with a fee.    i'm guessing...perhaps..he is speaking of some of the more ornate and touristy churches. [some of these places](https://www.google.com/search?q=famous+churches+germany es_sm=122 source=lnms tbm=isch sa=X ved=0CAcQ_AUoAWoVChMIhJPD7NDlxgIVw9SACh34RAJv biw=1280 bih=637) might be visited by non-catholics. Though i still fail to see the need for government in this case. The church can collect tithe from its members and charge a fee for tourists.    my geek club plays for upkeep of its place.  the geeks who use the club donate or pay a dues.  CRAZY I KNOW.. no gobberment needed and it works just fine. And when it doesnt, its because there is no need for your club cause no one is coming.   last, I know its kinda fucked up, but HAVE YOU SEEN CHURCHES? They have a tendency to be the most ornate and expensive buildings in town.. here in the US.. and they dont seem to require a tax collector to make that so. You can read this entire paragraph as saying .. THEY DONT NEED IT.. THEY ARE RICH AS FUCK.    nice explanation but that was part of the sarcasm of this post.  see the right got the point along ago. Dont yall remember the stories of all the muslims refusing to do their jobs in the run up to full islamophobia?  There was the cabbies in new york who wouldnt drive drunks and single women and blind people with a dog?  the right were all over "OMG IF YOUR STUPID RELIGION SAYS YOU CANT DO A JOB.. THEN GET A DIFFERENT JOB"  and i agreed.   there were more.. the fake story about the bus driver pulling over to pray, making all his passengers wait for a bus with a non muslim driver to drive them the rest of the way. It wasnt true but the right got it then.. same thing "if he cant do his job.."  and suddenly now it is christians, they are woefully ignorant and illogical again.  And we will kill this, its just too easy to do. its a last gasp of desperation to keep their bigotry.  But its already happening, mainly by satanist.. i'm guessing muslims dont want to cause a ruckus but it would help if they did with respect to these laws.  its really time we kill christian exceptionalism. I dont mind what you believe. Really dont give a fuck. As long as you dont affect me. What I do mind is the exceptions we give to the christian nuts. Mainly abortion. 'no tax dollars can be spent on this one single solitary legal thing'.. because it would offend the religious. They need that exception carved out in all laws. They attacked the breast cancer charity for giving to planned parenthood despite every dime is used for breast cancer screenings and materials. But ABORTION.  my tax dollars sure as fuck cna be used for torture, spying on everything i do, and blowing up people half a world a way, who didnt do shit to me but now dont like me very much anymore... I cant get an exception no matter HOW strongly i feel about it. I could have fainting attacks over it all. Doesnt matter. no exceptions for me...  and why just abortion? why dont they demand not a single penny of their tax dollars be used to pay someone to work on sunday? hmmmm     lol me too.

You are going to use every screw. You arent going to pick and choose, or your kids wont have shit to swing on. But I believe in the swing set, so i follow every word of the instructions.  no i contend that not only is religion complete bullshit, but that a lot  of them actually know this deep in their hearts.

Anyways, to change the mood, you do know Jeb made a law, similar to this story, where if a woman wanted to put her child up for adoption, and didnt know the father, she had to take out an ad like this. Which may sound good to some, but the point of the law was to shame single mothers. Jeb said their wasnt enough shame for them.     you can do anything as long as people comply and dont complain.  you actually have to defend your own rights.   Just like a cop can ask to search your car... its up to you to say no. He doesnt have the right to search, or he wouldnt ask. or like my beach guard comment, in this thread. People actually listen to him.. ignorantly and turn around and avoid 'their beach', there is NO LAW, preventing the beach guard from lying. Its actually up to the people to know that they have a right to access the beach despite this asshole is paid to tell them they dont.    its that way in the states as well.. though some people like to pretend it isnt true. grew up in a resort and certain beeches they will have a beach guard come tell you, its a private resort.. and you can just ignore him because while you cant leave the beach onto the private resort the beach itself isnt part of it. A lot of the rich, there,  get super annoyed when they realize the beach outside their homes isnt private.    and doesnt some of that soil just look damp.. like if you stuck your toes in it...   its always raises all the way into the ground.  but yeah, the comcast ceo is actually one of the top 5 overpaid ceos  and [yeah he made 32 million last year, 31 the year before and 29 the year before](http://www.thewrap.com/comcasts-brian-roberts-salary-31-4-million-nbcuniversals-stephen-burke-31-1-million-2013/)   though it should be noted that while the cable tv side is in decline, the net side is exploding and highly profitable.. insanely profitable.. unconsciously profitable.    and they are mostly staying alive on ignorance and sports.

THAT MEANS.. less property tax increases. OMG.  why did i direct at republicans? every state that legalized or medicalized, did so by progressives who were fighting republicans, the entire way.. small gov republicans tend to be big gov republicans when it comes to marijuana. Republicans are trying to force DC to under the voters wishes, by fucking with their budget. It is a republican group that is setting up rico lawsuits against marijuana companies and the businesses that do business with them in colorado and it is republicans in neighboring states suing colorado to try to force the fed to undo their laws. Yeah sure republicans passed a law saying the feds cant attack states that go medical.. ... that expires when Obama leaves office, despite Obama wasnt attacking states that did medical. Its horseshit     Pro-tip.. run the PC a bit strenuously(not that strenuously, just warm it up).  Run prime95 Get that CPU warm..   It will make the cooler sooooooooooooo much easier to remove.  When absolutely cold, the paste can actually be quite sticky. I have seen people rip out the entire cpu stuck to the cooler. So heat it up a little before trying to remove.    I figure its one of those scientifically designed games, designed around human psychology. The click and wait make you feel scheduled to play. they all tend to have the same BS. Clicks that can be reclicked in minutes , ones in a couple hours, and one in several hours. Some factory that can spit out cheap quick items, or spend all night making the good ones. The short ones when you playing and getting all your shit down, the medium for when at work, so you can check up at lunch hour and the long for when you sleep.  I've gotten sucked in before but its interesting to watch it happen to others.. we just have such a desire for efficiency. And after you 'learn' the game, you get locked into your routines, all your clicks are mostly the same each session. and yet they can feed an addiction. and a lot of these games are down to a science on how to play the weak for money.   that is ... if you trust the robot driver, who gave you that data.    i mean basically its the google car saying 'this is what happened'  ;P  Yeah i know.    the infamous wink wink nudge nudge exception. In SC for a while we had the video poker and you were actually not supposed to give people "winnings".. but you could give them refunds, so you asked them how much they put in.. and thats all you could legally give them.  Of course you took their word for it. They didnt like this wink wink and banned the machines completely.  and in my childhood home town, there was an infamous wink wink nudge nudge exception. We had blue laws which meant you couldnt buy shit on sunday.. literally.. manure couldnt be bought, only necessities(it was fucked some foods ok some not. yogurt ok but icecream not). But our town was a tourist beach town, and it annoyed the tourists they couldnt get towels and buckets for the kids on sundays. So we got a new law saying tourist items were ok on sunday. The next day the sticker sales went through the roof. By affixing a sticker with the town name to any item, it suddenly became a tourist item. So you could suddenly buy shit on sunday, as long as it had the sticker. And that wink wink nudge nudge destroyed our blue laws.  and last in my town, when they approved alcohol on sundays but only for restaurants, every single bar in town had some kind of food you could buy. One just had peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, which was enough to qualify for a sunday license. The wink wink nudge nudge is a powerful tool.    yeah you used to be able to get a commemorative bottle for the price of a tour.  and they still have bars and people still bring alcohol, the bars sell mixers and your not allowed to bring your own mixer. So cokes are banned, but liquor is fine. its all odd.   yeah its a dry county.. its kinda odd, as the distillery is  the biggest businesses there   Interesting case. Brings up a lot of mixed feelings and hypotheticals.  What if a baby is on the tracks, and you see a slowish train coming.. have all the time in the world to move the baby 3 feet out of the trains way.. but choose to film instead. A lot of people would want to charge him with something. It would be hard for him to use the 'reporter' defence.  same baby a few days later falls in an alligator pit, and no way to get to him easily or safely and he films.. its a bit more complicated now.  so should we have samaritan laws? and how should they be written? well should they cover doing all that safely and humanly possible?       You can choose not to give your data to private companies.  you do know what subreddit you are in?  Thats actually quite fucking hard these days. If you can actually manage to protect your own data and only give the info you want to people like google and MS and the government who buys it from them.... then you will be protected from the NSA as well  sorry you have a naive view about the privacy problem. Businesses can find out who your neighbors were 20 years ago.. tell me right now, what you signed or agreed to, for them to have that info? You dont even know what info of yours is on the private market and yet you sit here and claim you have a choice. Thats laughable man.  how many cam girls do you think know they are auto recorded by bots for the private market to resell their data? Yeha they should ASSUME someone is doing that right? But THEY HAVE NO FUCKING CHOICE dude. Its CAM and be recorded and resold.. or dont fucking cam.  The private market is just as sly. you dont always have a choice on your data.  Yeah she is in public this is a public example very easy for people to understand, it gets more convoluted.   tell me right now.. no google  which phone company can i use that wont sell to the government?  which grocery stores wont sell my data to the government?  what search engines?  which cookie trackers are ok? you know sites dont tell you.. you have to look.  sorry it takes two to tango and you dont always have a clear choice.. i bet you cant tell me the cookies you collected today and what sites they were from and how that data is being used.. without being a techie. yeha i can get all kinds of cookie blockers and i can encrypt my phone calls. but its not like there are choices.     so you are saying that we all know every bit of data the private market collects on us? and how they use databases to build profiles?  I'm not sure I agree.  and once again, the biggest customer of that private market data is the government. it takes two to tango.     we as in "the west".  Yes you didnt do it, i didnt do it.. but the WEST DID.. and if you live in one of those nations, its perfectly acceptable to say 'we' because well.. the east didnt do this. The west did.  Sorry if the term 'we' doesnt have to be limited to your family, your neighborhood, your town, your state, your country, or your hemisphere. I could have been more concise that I meant the west, but if you are part of the west,  its acceptable to say "WE"   just like you can say "they" when talking about the middle east.. unless you are in the middle east.. and then it goes back to a 'we'   'they' in the middle east, were arbitrarily fucked with, by 'we' the west, the people 'they' in the middle east keep attacking, all because 'they' in the middle east, sit on a fuck ton of oil.   my spelling can be off but the use of we is totally legit here.    the west, mainly england, israel and america.  but it was basically just western capitalist interests.  Its just a general term, like how people treat the middle east as one cohesive unit.. or asia as another.    well one day.. just not in 15 years. it wont even be noticeable. WE might get 3 years of no monthly record highs.. thats about it.  The maunder min occurred at the same time as an ice age, which started long before the sun went quiet and ended long after the sun went active again. Sunspots do have an effect on the enviroment but not that great. The little ice age was caused by more than a lack of sunspots, which is proven since the ice age started before the sun spots went away.. and didnt even really get worse when the min happened.  but the deniers have been going off on that for years despite the debunking.. much like they do with the hockey stick, despite it has been verified dozens of times by totally independent science groups, using totally different proxy data and often totally different proxies. When multiple independent groups, using different methods and different data all coming to the same conclusions, thats what we call a well supported fact.   YOU DID READ THE ARTICLE RIGHT? where the scientists said the papers totally lied about her report?    dishonest deniers, combined with a media that loves sensationalism.  the deniers started the ball rolling, the rest of the media jumped on it because it was some juicy denial.  and yeah there was probably some legitimate illiteracy since i read at least one article where they called the maunder minimum an ice age   lying? her report said nothing about ice age.. the conservative media went spewing lies about how she said an ice age was coming in 15 years and it spread all over.  are you just being obtuse? thats what this article is about.  it wasnt that this is OTHER scientists disputing what another said. THIS IS THE AUTHOR OF THE REPORT.. saying the media lied.  Its yelling the theatre isnt on fire when it is. Not sure what point you dont grasp about that fact.       [hilary closer to friends age](http://cdn28.us3.fansshare.com/photograph/hillaryclinton/hillary-rodham-clinton-bill-clinton-zoom-young-hillary-and-bill-clinton-350707849.jpg)  a [bit further back](http://a.abcnews.com/images/Politics/pol_bill_hillary_wedding_tl_150407_1_4x3_992.jpg)  i think they might not have inhaled right before that one.  :P    california is going to be an lesson to all of us about what the US faces as the coming reality of having to ration things like resources, like water.  Lake mead could be dried up by 2021, not only leaving california and Las vegas fucked for water, but also fucked for power.  People like Tom Selleck will start to see real jail time and not just weak fines for stealing the water that belongs to everyone.    no  yeah doesnt work this time      and the conservative media wont get in any trouble over this. it  was all an accident.. once again.   well its a bit more complicated than to call that "Saddam's aggression".  First kuwait was loosely part of iraq during teh ottoman empire, when we overthrew the ottomans, we went around drawing country borders and cut kuwait from iraq. We did this to better protect british interests from a strong iraq in the persian gulf.  Iraq has always felt kuwait was stolen from them. Kuwait and iraq got into economic conflict. And saddam accused them of slant drilling for oil into the iraqi territory.  saddam actually approached the US rep, and ASKED.. what would our response be to him invading kuwait. And our rep said it was an arab matter..(as in the people not the country), suggesting we wouldnt do anything. And so he invaded.  [gulf war wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_War)  [April Glaspie wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/April_Glaspie)  our rep  and dont forget saddam felt like he was our ally. We had just helped his country in the iran/iraq war(while secretly helping the iranians) and even changed the law so we could sell him the precursors to chemical weapons he used against the iranians.. the left overs of which we later recovered in the second gulf war rotting in the desert.   so its a bit more complex than to say "saddams aggression"  we built the middle east bed, out of the ashes of the ottomans.. its not the best way to make countries.    maybe it is march 14th, in 2005 and he does have a dentist appointment, just for some reason all of us woke up today thinking it is dec 9th, 2018.   and a huge difference, those same poor whites, are arrested less than poor blacks for the same crimes.  those same poor whites when arrested, get convicted less for the same crime.  those same poor whites get lower sentences than blacks for the same crime.  those same poor whites get 200% more call backs for the exact same resume as poor blacks. exact same resume.  those same poor whites are less likely to get shot by the cops when they run.  but what ever you do.. dont look at societal influence on the stat.  because the bigots only want you to look at one single solitary difference between the groups.. the one thing that cant be changed.. race.. and ignore all the other differences that could actually influence the stat.. like poverty you mentioned, but there is MORE.. a poor white person is treated different by society than a poor black person. its a fact. And that has influence on the stats.  we arent that different there are less differences between a black dude and a white dude than two chocolate labs with different mothers. There is no special predisposition for violence or anything else in race.. race is mostly just a societal concept. you cant draw lines and say this is black and this isnt, in science.. race just doesnt really exist.     op is a racist  black on black crime isnt any worse than white on white. You tend to do crimes against people near you.. it happens we are still well segregated.  but yeah the point is to put the stat out there, show one 'difference', in this case color.. the point is to mislead and to suggest, blacks due to being black are murderous. And then they go from 'til" to propaganda. You cant do science that way. Its like showing how most herion addicts drank milk before ever becoming addicted to heroin, therefore milk must be a gateway drug. yeah some people who drink milk dont end up on heroin, but nearly all heroin users drank milk at one time in theri lives. Its the same with this horseshit. 'sure some black people never commit a single crime, but since most convicted for crimes are black therefore being black caused it"      everyone knows why this shit is being constantly posted all over reddit.  we get it black people murder more whites than white people murder blacks.. but that info out of context doesnt tell you shit. The problem is when these armchair ~~bigots~~..er scientists try to interpret the data.  and why is it always black versus white? same data show men do most the murdering.. maybe we should all hate on men.. maybe men are predispositioned to murder.. so anti man hate isnt sexist.. its supported by the data.  but you dont see this shit posted constantly.. because anti man hate isnt their goal, so they cherry pick race.   and if you dont get context.. blacks have less opportunity than whites, blacks get arrested more than whites for the same crime, leaving them less opportunities for jobs and blacks are treated as criminals even when not for most of their lives.. you can see in experimentation where even black children think being black makes them bad and evil, you get taught this all your life.. that your damned no matter what you do.. that might effect the murder rate.  also its been reposted to hell on til    you mean the cyber war? yeah its been going on for decades.  its similar to economic wars and spying for our corps.. these wars dont get fought in the open.  and china been doing this for decades.. they used to just drop infected USB sticks in our government parking lots. Whats a rank and file employee going to do with a found usb stick? yep.. plug it in and see whats on it.  anyways, we in the US get to hear about it when its everyone else. You dont get to hear about us doing the same things over there. A little now and then with snowden and the virus we helped attack the iranians with.. but mostly you dont hear it. Well we are the worlds biggest spies. Then its china and then israel.  the biggest problem with this, is the info they got...this was a nuke going off. They got some juicy bits. of course we wont hear about it, if the NSA got the same info on chinese politicians.     no so sure about that 0.. the NSA not just collecting data on US.     There are actually some way better answers but this one works on the "the gov is your bestest friend" crowd.  and same could be said about the private market which also had some spectacular data breaches that often they lie about for a long time before finally admitting it.  There are better answers of course but this one works on the 'private market is perfect and your bestest friend ever crowd and is totally different than the government'  sorry dude, had to.  the government isnt the only people we have to protect our privacy from. Matter of fact the biggest customer of the private markets selling of our data.. is the GOBBERMENT.  so lets just agree it takes two to tango, and their is shit on both side of the private market, public market fence.    they make small ac units that attach to the fan intact.  People who spent 2k for an invisible tent arent going to be hot.    click the picts.  in pict 2, you can better see the floor which looks rather solid.. it looks like fold up slabs of pvc.  you can also see the tube that you use to blow it up.. you keep the fan on, constantly to keep it blown up and air coming in.     first pict is an ocean.. and yeah they arent a fan of salt water or wind. The rest of the picts aren't at an ocean.   estonia wifi'd pretty much the entire country.. over a decade ago.  GO USA.. GO USA... catch up to the likes of estonia.. now google where the fuck that country is, cause I know you dont know.   its a former soviet state..(think on that a bit).. yeah its tiny and all that.. but it rose from the fall of the soviet union, which we bleed to death with the cold war.. and it didnt have the benefits of moscow..but they wifi'd their entire country. (PS people still buy net)      She will be happy to know we are only doing this to protect the children... /s   dont have chickens.. love this sub, would like chickens, dnt like eggs much but would like chickens anyways.... i know a ton of you hug and kiss chickens.. and i'm fairly sure most of you dont get sick, though, I figured i'd share the science findings.         and in contrast.. i have seen dogs react to time very well. my friends dog gets excited when his kids are about to return home from school. long before he could possibly hear the bus. And ex girls dog, used to know walky times a bit well as she was a bit regular. Yeah you could say he had biology pressing on his bones.. but if she was distracted at the 'time' he would show up with his leash. now it might not be based on 'time' but other clues.. 'when i hear this tv show, it means kids almost home, and they give me treats'. but i have seen clockwork pets.   and as for "gone for an hour versus 10".. maybe they know the time, but are still just as excited to see you... an hours a long time when you cant play on the net.   at an estimated 2.4 trillion when all is said and done, it is a little more than 4 times the entire budget of nasa since its inception. The moon landings, hubble and fix, the space stations(there was skylab), the mars probes and rovers, the lost craft and space shuttles, this trip to pluto, all of it.   i tried, but [screwed up along the way](http://i.imgur.com/8eCxmsw.gifv)   its also hard to say what is a religious war.. did the muslims hit the towers due to religion or the bases? was the iraq war a religious war? our president got war reports covered in biblical imagery and south evangelicals saying god choose bush to start the end times in the middle east.. and many of the enemy called it a war against islam. History wont call it a religious war. There was a coalition of causes and agendas, but its hard to deny that religion played a part in the war on both sides   it flows up, which is why some of the best stimulus is food stamps and UE.  And your pay is actually just a cut, that you get from the total value of your man labor hours, that the owners a lot you for providing the means of production. You flip burgers for $5 an hr, hes selling your hours for more to the public or he is going out of business. $5 an hour is your cut from your production, due to him owning the franchise. So the higher ups already get a cut of peoples earnings, thats one  of the ways to get rich, is have others earn it for you.  and of course the lower you go down, the more of that paycheck that gets spent and the bottom brackets spend more than 100% as they need food stamps. That money flows up, because the biggest chunk goes to the owner of the mcdonalds, while only a small portion goes to the burger flipper, and yes, the owner of the franchise, pays up, to the mcdonalds corp which extracts some value from his earnings and so on.  money flows up, thats kinda the point to capitalism(without progressive taxes and/or  basic income)... thats why its all in a pile at the top.. and kinda missing at the bottom. It disappears at the bottom and reappears at the top.   It is English.  There is no is in [Minnesota nice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_nice). It is a type of nice.     the intelligent enough to be really dangerous. The really good conspiracy theorists, have some brains, just not a lot of sense. And you mix in a shit load of truth, with the nutty stuff, makes it easier to go down.  you dont just come out and say the UN is a space cult, no you talk about the estrogen levels in our water(true), the new concerns to protect our kids in sports(true) and the everyone is a winner generation(a little true).. and then tie all that into making our kids gay, and there is enough shit you can look up, thats "oh shit he was right about the estrogen"...  that space shit might be true .. Idk not a good conspiracy theorist .. but you put enough true stuff for people to look up, suddenly the wacky stuff seems more real.  and not all his conspiracies were that wacky sounding. so, yeah its kinda easy to see that. Thats what makes them the most dangerous. the good ones arent the crazy lady screaming about rainbows in her fountain.   he is entertaining i will give him that.   odds can be odd at times.   non intuitive. I remember the 'smartest woman in the world" got a lot  of attacks when she correctly gave the odds to the [monty hall problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Hall_problem). Many a learned face had egg on them that day.   Yeha love the non intuitive maths and sciences, it messes with the brain. But be careful with verbiage.  Your dehydrating by more than 1%.. there is a reason why the wiki said dehydrating until it was 98% water. your dehydrating the water down by 50%.. thats the key to the riddle, the way its worded.   and here is another .. that used to bug me.. its a physics one.  you got a plane with perfect mathematical wheels on a runway, thats also a treadmill. The treadmill is hooked up to detectors so it will go in the reverse direction of the plane at the same speed as the plane... will the plane take off.    Still, its a good TIL, so i upvote even with the small caveat on the title.       its dangerous to dismiss this as just pandering. and most likely it will cost taxpayers a lot of money.  ok you make a law saying 'clergy cant be forced to participate.. in a gay wedding'  when they are already protected from marrying gays.... but they arent from 'participation' depending on job or service. I hear ya.. his job is priest.. no it isnt, thats his title... it doesnt have to be his job. And anyone can become one. You could be a baker... or the justice of the peace, or a judge....  See no one can tell a church, that they have to host a gay marrage or that any priest has to marry gay people.... however, once those same people enter the public market place, WE CAN order them to not discriminate. they dont have to put a message on the cake, but if they sell cakes to the public, they got to sell you a cake. Though not sure if you want a cake made by someone that hates you.  this Bill would appear to say, if you sell cakes and send $5 off to get  ordained with the universal life church as a priest and suddenly you can be a bigot in the public market place. And say 'the act of selling a cake is participation'  you got to watch it.. sometimes things that seem like useless pandering can actually have real meaning behind them. thats not to say it would stand up in court, but this asshole isnt going to be the one paying the court bills.   It was insane, the telegraph was the first i believe to go all ice age.. that was expected. The rest of the media running with the clickbait wasnt. you'd think the people who saw the telegraph article might have read it and saw all the conjecture came from the reporter and not the scientist.  and what gets me is the media have swallowed this BS pill put out by the deniers that there was a global little ice age and it was 100% caused by the lack of sun spots, despite starting years before the sun went quiet. and ended years before the sun went active again.   and for some reason missed north america.. but what ever.  They sit there and scream that all the correlations in the climate record, all the proxy records are all bullshit..but a single solitary event in history correlating to a single solitary event in the sun, all of which MEASURED WITH PROXY DATA.. there was no direct measurement back then and fuck.. measuring sun spots.. in the 1600s. and this shit is the word of god, and all because of sunspots?  You really cant prove anything with an event of 1.   i bet you dude proud of his downvotes thinks the little ice age is the word of god and caused by sun spots.. wont be able to tell you a single scientist involved that even coined the term maunder minimum but he sure as shit will tell you it in fact caused the little ice age.   it was more than a media failing.. you have a known liar lying about a subject they always lie about, making radical claims about that subject that sounds like the exact opposite of what everyone else is claiming..... well you might want to take a second look.   i'd take a second look at shit dailykos claims about republicans.. i demand a source. because despite being left myself i know the publication is biased and i want the truth. Well you should second guess every word about climate change from the telegraph, because they are going to lie every time.     sigh.. this horse shit again.  one you can prove agw yourself with some dry ice you cna get at any supermarket and two tupperwares and two thermometers.  Climate change versus global warming. Both were used with equal frequency until the early 2000s when suddenly climate change was used about 3/4s of the time.. what had happened?  LUNTZ.. [Frank Luntz and his global warming memo](http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2003/mar/04/usnews.climatechange)  it was LUNTZ(R) and his focus groups who decided out of the two terms. AGW versus  Climate change, that climate change was less scary sounding.  you know the same assholes who like to call torture, 'enhanced interrogation' and the enemy was 'illegal combatants' so we didnt have to follow the law.  It was your denialists who choose to make climate change the perfered term.  and over night all republicans obeyed, they dropped the term global warming from their lexicon  and thats why climate change won out over AGW... despite in papers its still about 50/50   The phrase "global warming" should be abandoned in favour of "climate change", Mr Luntz says, and the party should describe its policies as "conservationist" instead of "environmentalist", because "most people" think environmentalists are "extremists" who indulge in "some pretty bizarre behaviour... that turns off many voters".   I wear my negative comment karma like a badge of honor in this land of disinformation and shilling for the establishment that Reddit has become. I fight for truth and look only for real karma.  its just a crown to idiocy. Its a shame you cant see that. There is nothing wrong with being ignorant, but there is something wrong with holding onto that ignorance with a death grip in the face of facts.      political loaded garbage. Yeah we want to figure shit out, it lowers health care cost. We also spent a ton on why black people get high blood pressure than whites. This is loaded garbage. same study showed non gay men are fatter than gay men. Why wasnt this titled based on that part or at least showed the difference? gay women tend to have higher obesity rates while hetero men do... but this is titled just looking at the woman part and ignoring it studied both heteros and gay people.. they are trying to find the obesity connections. its because this is political horseshit.  hint if it is dailykos, or freebeacon, it belongs in /r/politics not the news.   E^2= (mc^2)^2 + (pc)^2  is the more complete equation, that p after the plus is momentum.  when mass is zero e=pc  when momentum is zero  e=mc^2   I have a problem with the title, and yeah know it isnt OP. you can argue they are stupid, that their complaints arent based in science and you can even argue that no-gmo food makers support this and that it will hurt GMO food makers bottom line, but i still dont think you can call it an anti-gmo labeling law. then you start to get into politics over reporting. Its a disclosure law. right or wrong doesnt matter.. we can have a regulation that every thing made by a dude named fred be labeled as such. it probably offers as much meaning as GMO labeling from a science standpoint. but you cant call it an anti fred law.   now i think the anti-gmo people are like anti vaxxers but i do like information. Not a big fan of labeling stupid shit like gmo, but i think people should be able to find out 100% of the information about their food, who harvests it, how it gets to them, how its grown, what countries, gmo, or not, kosher or not. tap water or real mountain springs. People should be allowed to refuse to buy shit for completely nonsensical reasons.(which to me kosher is a bit...) and there really isnt much cost involved in having that info on a website versus labels.    i smell lawsuit.   [far too much](https://youtu.be/G3gNos3CX8Q?t=67)    yeah amazon over hyped a bit.. but everyone ran with it.  Anyone remember black friday or black monday from last year?  Both were HUGE disappointments.   [black friday has been getting worse for years](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-12-01/u-s-index-futures-decline-as-oil-falls-china-pmi-misses)  one of the problems is technology, the point of the deals was to get you in the store. Well people hate the busy shopping experience and they can double check sales and items on their phone.. the value of getting people into your store went down and so did the sales.  cybermonday was a bit more fucked from the start.. there is even less value to getting people into your stores.. online. you cant hope they buy the ridiculously overpriced batteries while they are there when they can just type in another address and get them where they are on sale.(they are going to have to change to min orders.. sale price valid with $45 worth of purchase and such)  why did anyone expect this off season sale to be different? yeha amazon said "bigger than black friday" and they can go suck a bag of dicks, but why listen to them? the  car lot down the road is always having the most amazing sale of the century.  this really was about as good as i expected. I didnt expect amazing sales. There isnt a lot of value in them anymore, especially for us virtual shoppers. And as such, the sales are going to be weak.    what about that thing that almost looks like a fault line cutting through the mountains. I figure not a fault but it seems to continue for a long while and really resembles ones on earth   mailmen, some of the most loved government employees.    he was so right about iraq as well.  and its all horseshit, we get to watch everything.  no one says this is a free reign to fund terrorism or anything else.  nothing in this says we cant attack them later for doing such things.   anyways hes proven himself to be a bigot warmonger and his own mossad disagrees with him on the deal. They dont think its the best, but they damn well think its better than doing nothing but continuing sanctions.    South Carolina - Set by municipality (ranges from 12am to 2am)  Not true.. ranges 12am til ....  I tended a bar that didnt even open until midnight.. we sometimes closed after noon.  most bars in town here are open until things slow down, i stumbled out of many into the daylight..except saturdays, when things tend to close at 2am across the board.  the rest of the week.. they stay open til when ever.. it was actually a culture shock going to other states and seeing their bars close so early when night life here and start rather late.    everyone has theri ways,..for me it is too much sugar in the mouth.. works ever time and instantly.  the sipping water never has. quite sure my method doesnt work for everyone either, though i think they are doing it wrong :P    and what happens when you cant tell the cgi from the real thing...   and people in the US need to check local state laws.. cause that shit is banned in many states here.   its one reason they got so freaky with porn   the educated world levels out and even declines some, africa has a lot of growth in her. And the [place is a lot bigger than it looks via maps.](http://kai.sub.blue/images/true_size_of_africa_v3-da3dd38e.jpg)  but yeah look at the [map, they having lots of babies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_sovereign_states_and_dependent_territories_by_fertility_rate)   and an [excellent ted on population growth and poverty and how things are better and worse than you think](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FACK2knC08E)     well that doesnt make sense.  1. if places for worship are for god alone, then why do people go there? do they want the mosque empty? maybe they are saying 'for worship only.. no bingo".. that might piss off some christians.  2. why would christians get more mad at the billboard than they do already at the other abrahamic sect? allah is just arabic for the word god.. its not even a name like yahweh, its literally the word god.  And its the god of abraham, so the billboard says "places of worship are for the god of abraham alone"(which by the way, is the same god as the christians, they all believe in the adam and eve crap)     I would pull harder if told i was alone and blindfolded, i wouldnt want to be pulled on my face.   prolly should have posted this to /r/freebies   not to undercut his business but as they say behind the barn.... if you can get the milk for free.. /r/redditgetsdrawn    i got confused and downvoted all my upvotes and upvoted all my downs. I feel like a different person.   now here is one for /r/legaladvice if someone eventually gets attacked by that shark, can they sue these people?  just a thought.. not a suggestion.    Sometimes i feel like an alien on my own planet, watching a society so culturally different, that the human mind doesn't even have the capacity to ever understand it.  "you are sending a camera 4 billion miles away to take a picture of a rock/icecube and some of you still think magnets are magic?"  People seem to think science missed a lot of low hanging fruit.  yeah a lot of herbal medicines do work and when they do, we find out why and make it potent as fuck and turn it into a pill.  and how the fuck are homeopaths in business, as a customer, get a fucking jug of distilled water, pour half your bs in a jar, fill the rest with distilled, give to a friend, now both you got twice as much and twice as strong BS for free. You can do that shit for life. its stupidity beyond comprehension.  *breathe cow, breathe...*   yall are ranked the worst of all. Well D.C. actually but yall are the worst state.  with 1/5 of your bridges scary as fuck.. and over 1/3 of your roads barely count as roads. lol, sorry but glad i dont drive there.   [source](http://www.businessinsider.com/worst-state-road-systems-2010-7)   and really with car repairs what your doing is paying a pothole tax to the repair dudes which costs us all more than just taxing us and fixing the damn roads.    its ok, we plan to tax the poor to fix our roads, with a little help from the revenue fairy.  (honestly, our governor's plan cuts everyone taxes but the bottom brackets, whose taxes will go up.. and this is a revenue plan to fix our roads.. its an income tax cut which the bottom brackets get refunds and such wont help, coupled with a gas tax hike, which they say over all the average tax payer will save $66.. if you get a cut, which the bottom brackets wont, but if they drive, they will see a hike.)    the titles bug the fuck out of me, because a lot of people never make it past it, even us esteemed redditors. And one of the biggest problems with misinformation, is our human tendency to lock in the first thing we learn. Some of us worse than others of course but they have shown even people who are more open to being wrong, often resist prove they are completely opposite from being right.(i know technically that phrase means 'wrong' but there are levels to wrongness)   its more clickable.  it wasnt a "poor interpretation".. that suggests a mistake. There was no mistake. Its called propaganda that the rest of the media ran with because it was so god damn click baity. The telegraph damn well knew what it was doing when it distorted the scientists claims.     Actually not really.  First sunspot activity does show a small but real effect on climate but its WAY WAY SMALL.. we are talking about adjustments to the el nino/la nina cycle..stuff people have to measure to tell you this winter is colder than last. Its way minor.  the mini ice age which looks localized to europe(north america was only slightly cooler at the time).. started when the sun was active.. the Maunder minimum occurred IN MIDDLE OF THE MINI ICE AGE.  it didnt cause the mini ice age to get significantly worse at all. temps were mostly the same before the min as after.  And yeah the scientists in this project never said we are heading to an ice age, never even said this will help slow AGW.. all they said is they are predicting sun spot activity will drop to levels not seen since the mauder minimum.  THE TELEGRAPH.. a right winger denialist mag, decided to interpret that as "ice age" and many  other mags followed suit even conflating the term Maunder minimum with ice age. See the denialist rags, love to pretend the mini ice age was   1. 100% global and real and perfect climate science but all the rest is bullshit  2. 100% caused by a lack of sun spots and please dont look when the cooling began. and dont look at a single other cooling element.   so when they heard sun spot drop to maunder min levels.. all they heard was ice age and ran with it.  WHAT PISSED ME THE FUCK OFF.. is all the media just went with the telegraphs interpretation of what the scientists said.  well A thats a fuck ton more clickable.. to say we are heading towards an ice age than 'the sun will have less spots than usual'  But yeah.. we had a busy sun.. and a strong el nino, that helped push 1998 record.. but heres the rub.. we have one of the quietest suns we have seen already.. we are coming out of a protracted minimum.. not as bad as maunder but the worse since direct records.. right now. And wel el nino is still a bit absent but slowly we seem to be heading that way..  BUT WE STILL SET THE RECORD LAST YEAR.  the effect sunspots have on climate, while REAL.. it is a plus/minus in the big ass equation, is minor as fuck.. and there were other mins besides maunder.. and we really didnt see much of a change in temps.. the little ice age, started before the sunspots got low.. it doesnt look to be even global and definitely had other causes besides sunspots.    we started cooling 2000 years ago.. which is inline with our tile cycles.. it was overcome by AGW.  we already are pumping co2 to slow down an iceage.   we would all die.. even if it was 40% cooler   the 60% doesnt make any sense.  the model suggests we will hit [Maunder Minimum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maunder_Minimum) like sunspot levels.. and thats way more than 60% drop  Sprer noted that during one 30-year period within the Maunder Minimum observations showed fewer than 50 sunspots, as opposed to a more typical 40,00050,000 spots in modern times  but the solar irradiance [hasnt fluctuated more than 0.2% in the past 2000 years.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_variation)        greatest debate reply in the history of reddit.  absolutely nothing about this deal changes any opportunity to blow the every living shit out of them. The big difference is we can actually go see their shit what they are doing.. which is fucking excellent since bush inc outed the cia agent working on the iranian wmd program destroying lines of intelligence into the place.   Stop being a child, if you got something to say, speak the fuck up.  its easy as shit to say nothing but to attack the only person offering any thoughts or comments in this. Which is why i suspect you choose your stupid child like attacking comment rather than offer any kind of meaningful debate.   I mean you do see the irony, in your content less comment calling mind "dumbest".. nah i suspect that idea went right over your little head.     the us didnt have diplomatic relations with iran for decades that's similar enough to not recognizing. WE help fund the mek, supported saddam in the iran/iraq war and some the iranians through isreal, something like a million died in that war. Helped overthrow their democracy with the shah. Shot down one of their airliners...and many here call for us to "nuke the place to the stone age" and then israel and the settlements.........  just saying is all. Not defending irans actions but theres a lot of "oops my bad" to go around.  And we might need to step back a bit before throwing nazi references arround.    even if it fails, it was the right thing to do.  and of course failure doesnt mean they get a nuke, failure, means they continue on the path to get one and the world chooses other options.   How often is this dude going to the dmv? Years ago it was once every 1-3 years for me, depending if they changed license plate styles or i changed cars. Now I go even less, due to you can do pretty much all of it online. And years ago for me.. it was kinda sucky, but since then they got a desk person that answers your questions as you walk in and you take a number and a seat. Its a lot better then the old days when you had to fight the leopards before they would see you. really today you could just replace them with a licence plate vending machine and photo booth/driving sim    we already help feed the north koreans.. and rather inefficiently.. i think the world would be more than willing to help reunification.. and yeah it wont be anything like east and west germany, not just in costs, those people are fucked up. they've been brainwashed since birth. And live in a fallout looking society, complete with campy 50s looking propaganda posters.    no they didnt.  some scientists say our sunspot count will fall to a level not seen since the Maunder minimum, which coincided with a mini iceage.  Thats not the same  Not a single scientists even suggested we will enter a mini ice age or that it will even help with global warming.  which predicts solar output will fall by 60 percent during the 2030s to conditions last seen during the Maunder minimum ("mini ice age") that began in 1645.  also horseshit.. sunspot number will drop by 60%(actually more if the paper is correct.. not really sure where they get the 60).. not solar output, thats just insanity. During the mini ice age, solar irradiance was only down by 0.2%  and the [maunder minimum occurred long  after the mini iceage started.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maunder_Minimum) (read the lack of  sunspots didnt cause the shit)  people need to quit quoting conservatives who are interpreting science papers.    My aunts preacher came by after she had gotten divorced and remarked that the size of her place showed she never paid enough tithe.    and i dont have a problem with them leaning on members a bit, like any club, but this and what my aunt went through is a bit ridiculous. And well for most churches that i have seen, if they spent a little less on the building, they would have had a lot more money, for good deeds and priest salaries.  they like to call us athiests/agnostics a religion, well if we were, we sure do it cheap as fuck.  We dont have or need gawdy buildings or preachers to pay. They should take note.   things are actually a [lot more peaceful, our access to info has just increased.](http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2014/jul/21/stu-burguiere/fewer-wars-fewer-people-dying-wars-now-quite-some/)    [tin soldiers and nixons coming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GXtQfXBAmM)  edit: i figure the downvoters are youngins or republicans who dont get it. For the people who dont get the reference, this song is about this event.  here is the [wiki on it](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio_(Crosby,_Stills,_Nash_%26_Young_song\))  its more than famous, and unconscionable it wasnt mentioned in the article.. it became part of the anti war coulture immediately and has been played at anti government protests since it was released.      we sent the probe so long ago... we didnt have enough info to complete the mission when it was launched. We didnt know with enough accuracy where pluto would be in order to capture the closest pictures as we flew by.  Due to its 248 year orbit and only limited data since its discovery.  That blew my mind.. they had to finish working that shit out   how does it go, boxing is one of the only sports where you can get arrested for a pick up game in the streets.    and the article debunking it has some .. 'warning signs'  they emailed amazon and asked them to look and see if they saw the bulk sales and amazon said no.. and they say    casting further doubt on the Times' claim that the book  "A Time for Truth"  had been omitted from its list because sales had been driven by "strategic bulk purchases."  which is odd, since the times claimed they HIRED INDIVIDUALS to do it. they are asking amazon if they have any evidence of a crime that wouldnt leave that type of evidence, if done as alleged.. and claiming "this casts doubt"  its like a newspaper saying, a president of this country was killed by a poison that leaves no traces after 24 hours. and the opposition saying "we autopsied the body 48 hours later and found no sign of said chemical, this furthers puts doubt to the claim he was poisoned"  now we can debate about the evidence the paper has that SAYS he was poisoned, but there should be little debate that the debunking did no such thing.  same in this case.  and not only that it is presented as amazon debunking, rather than a newspaper emailing a spokesperson to look into their database.  its more than week.  Now i would like to see more from the times on this... but the debunkers are using the usual political tricks.      yes we are.. so why didnt you say the same to   "amazon disagrees"  amazon saying there is no evidence in its database of bulk selling of cruz's book is not the same as saying amazon disagrees that it is happening... or disagrees with the post article at all. Someone asked them and they said no they dont see that in the data.  a heavier weighted statment is from the publisher themselves but even then all they say is they dont have evidence of it.  no this isnt an absence of evidence remark, this is /r/skeptic and amazon did not say they disagreed.      [well we did.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran%E2%80%93Iraq_War) We supported saddam and sold him precursors to chemical weapons when he invaded iran giving him radar images of iranian troop movements so he could better gas them. When saddam started to win, we supported iran with the same info, though israel and the iran contra crap. This lead to over a million people dying in 2 countries with about 1/3 the citizens of the us.   we also '[accidentally' shot down an iranian commercial airliner during  gulf 1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran_Air_Flight_655), mistaking it for a much much smaller fighter jet. we never even said sorry.  yeah they took some of us hostage for over a year... after taking back their country [which we helped overthrow when they voted in leftist who wanted to nationalize their oil, and instead installed our buddy the shah](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/aug/19/cia-admits-role-1953-iranian-coup).. and with him, [we helped start the iranian nuclear program under the 'atoms for peace program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_program_of_Iran)  you can say they are a bunch of crazy religious nuts today, but no one can deny that we have been fucking with them hard core for about 100 years now.  Mind you these are all wiki links.      headed by 2 reagan republicans.. they also trying to overturn the will of the people in DC   does the dailyshow work in IE?  whats your flash version in chrome components?  eitherway sounds like malware.  chrome doesnt use adobe flash anymore.. they use pepper.  make sure chromes up to date by goign to the pull down on top right and selecting about chrome.  next time this happens, get screenshots of your components page, and that sketchy site that the click through goes to     the ncaa boycott came from the naacp. which is why it started less than a year later.  we also lost more than NCAA tourneys.. there is a reason why you dont see tiger at the heritage.  we also lost a fuck ton of concerts i suspect you werent interested in.   we lost millions from the boycotts.  but yeah like maurice and his BBQ sauce.. we didnt give a fuck.. but dont pretend it didnt hurt.. it hurt a lot more than NCAA championship games.     no they didnt.  A group released a paper, that isnt wildly accepted yet, that said we are due for an extreme solar min, similar to the one during the "mini ice age" which seemed to only really effect europe and didnt effect the southern hemisphere at all.  now there have been ups and downs of sun spots through out time, and they have always shown, just a very very very minor effect on climate. its real but minor. During the mini iceage there were likely many cooling effects including a quiet sun that all combined to give us the cooler temps. Much like we had a very active sun in 1998 which helped set that record... but since then, we have had a very very quiet sun.. an unusually quiet sun, and yet we are still fucking setting records.  **NOT A SINGLE SCIENTIST ON THE PROJECT EVER USED THE WORDS that a mini ice age MAY start in 15 years**  read the fucking report yourself and not the right winger telegraph interpretation of the report.   and fucking amazing how the denialists think the 'mini ice age' was real and global and the word of god and 100% caused by sun spots,  this is written in diamond.... but all other climate science is a guess and a hoax and a joke. ER.....   anyways this is horse shit, and the raw story should have known better. Not a god damn scientists made this claim. They simply said we havent seen sunspots this low(predicted to come) since the maunder minimum.. and everyone ran with 'scientist say ice age is coming'... not evne close to true.   PS the last time the earths tilt was like it is today... we were in an ice age.  OH MER GERD.  mans influences are stronger than that.. wow..   we were actually entering a cooling phase by the tilt cycle that lasted for nearly 2000 years, until... about 150 years ago.. when the industrial age happened.(and yes notice that "mini ice age" happened in that period) But notice back 370 years ago.. what wasnt happening, was man wasnt spewing all this carbon into the air.. ok we spewed a lot but  to even compare how much we spewed back then versus today we would have to have a logarithmic graph because we spew exponentially more than they did back then...   to long didnt read, there is a fucking reason why newyork is surrounding itself with sea walls and florida is surrounding its cities with huge drains and water pumps and why russia put a flag on the sea floor in the arctic and why exxon decided to not exploit a field because it would be the single biggest carbon emitter if they did and they dodnt want that advertisement.    now for actual defence... i dont give a fuck if you like to fuck goats. if someone attacks us, i say give that dude a goat and a gun.    eh if they catch the  throwers.. yeha charge them. People are allowed to be bigots, and people are allowed to call bigots names.. when you start to throw shit, you cross the line from the 'high ground' to the low.  for the "flag run" folks.. yeah it sucks,  and no not defending .. what they did was wrong.. ABSOLUTELY.. they shouldnt have thrown shit at your truck, but also know that if you are an insensitive bigot and drive through minority neighborhoods where people are a bit offended by that flag... well your going to be more likely to have shit thrown at you.. not that it justifies anything but if you purposefully drive through a minority neighborhood trying to provoke this reaction, you too are part of the problem.. not just the people throwing shit.    Of course, robots will need maintenance, controllers and designers.    which ... WILL.... BE.... DONE... BY ROBOTS.  its already happening. WE have robot coders that are better than human coders at repairing old software.  we got robots making math proofs longer than humans can check.  robots will design robots.  maintenance? lol dont make me laugh thats one of the first robot job that will get automated.   controllers?  does this man even understand the problem?  who controls the electric uber car when i get in and say take me to the airport? oh gps and automation.. there is no "drone driver" the robot IS the controller.  I mean thats kinda all basic, if he doesnt understaand that, he doesnt understand the problem.  I also like his solution is job invention... he also doesnt seem to understand economics or where jobs actually come from.  interesting post of the kind of people we will have to deal with when debating UBI.  I am quite sure he is a highly intelligent fellow. A lot of what he says sounds very reasonable....... ESPECIALLY to people who dont have a clue what tech really is about to bring to us. I dont get how he can understand 'even very highly skilled jobs" will be replaced by robots.. what does he think programmers and designers are? gods? They are highly skilled people, ... who will be replaced by robots. I think he gets doctors will be replaced, well engineers arent magic, or gods.. they are highly trained in fields a lot of people dont understand.. like doctors but there is nothing specifically magical that makes their jobs protected.  Robots will design better robots than a human can.  They will be automatically maintained and will need no controller.    and the females generally mate with much younger males, as the males born at the same time as her have long since died... before she even got of age to mate.   and yeah that surprised me they dont "mimic orchids", because they look mighty mighty orchid like to me, but I dont happen to be an insect.  and the whole, shes just as likely to eat you as mate with you and might anyways when your are done...makes dating an interesting affair.  yeah i dont know squat about bugs either, but every once in a while a post will make me go out and get learneded.    here is the [link to the tips](https://www.fasttech.com/products/3099/10011753/2763500-resin-510-drip-tip-7-pieces)  but really [browse the store](https://www.fasttech.com/category/3017/drip-tips-others) This is just the "other" catagory, look on the left..  so many drip tips, you will not be able to browse them all.   delivery can be a bit slow if not used to fasttech.. not as slow as it used to be but still pretty f-n slow. Still the price rocks on most things..    and credit goes to the [fasttech digest](https://www.reddit.com/r/electronic_cigarette/comments/3d3wxv/fasttech_digest_77713/) at  /r/electronic_cigarette   /u/DONG_MAGNUM posts weekly finds from there.. i like his little threads   they been doing it for longer than i have been alive.  dont you know america is full of gangsters and the homeless and gays and nothing else.  You ever watch that awesome movie, Citizen X?  one of the problems they had investigating the serial killer was moscow denied russia had that kind of problem.. that was a problem inherent with the west  and think they are bad.. north korea takes the propaganda cake.  now aint here to claim the opposite, that our shit dont stink, but it is humerous watching other countries claim the same.       they look horribly cheap.  not even sure how they are supposed to hold on.  awesome close ups of the quality.   i guess you jam this on a working drip tip?  yeah they look pretty cool, but price is a bit high for a 50 cent toy with a hole in it.    I agree but even for those, its a bit high.    now pretend one dude is blind but still lead him by his hand, dress a bit better.   I do wonder why we never took the russian route with conservatives.... "you know commies hate gays... your not a commie are you."  derogatory terms due to audience of course.    kinda amateur andy kaufman esc humour maybe.. well the parts andy did where you were pretty sure it was a joke but that you missed the punchline. Not that this rises to the art of kaufman.. but i could see some of the same reactions to it.. you first think its a joke, then you look for a punchline and find none and then you wonder if he is serious.. maybe the prank is on him. And you leave just confused.    i dont see the v3 on there.. can you link? sites not always the best with search   its actually a little different, has more options and can handle partitions windows disk manager can't.  and yeah you can use it even if you cant get into windows, with a boot cd.  disk manager has all the basics most people need.. but diskpart will help on them rare occasions that disk manager just cant.      unfortunately all you still have is likely conjecture.  A lot of redditors will recognize this, you see a title for an article and your brain, all on its own, invents the wittiest and funniest thing ever.. you click on comments and find it is the top post already. There is 7 billion of us, a lot of thoughts happen independently in many minds, there have even been noted scientific discoveries that happened simultaneously without the two knowing about each other.  but 'life court' tends to not need absolute scientific level proof and your evidence is strong, just remember though, with 99.9% certainty, there is still a 0.1% chance you are wrong. :)    good thing we have wiped out fish populations so much.   swimming 200 years ago would have been much more scary.   smaller more rigid boxes help as well.    why is this spun ass political horseshit here?  Thats not at all what the 'scientists predict'  Yes some solar scientist do predict a drastic reduction in solar activity and yes  the last time the earth saw this low of solar activity was during the "mini ice age"  which was mainly limited to europe, even the americas while colder wherent in an ice age and the southern poles seemed to completely miss it...and thats where the truth leaves the barn in this article. Sunspot activitiy only mildly effects climate at most.. they have one single event that was highly localized that correlated to a time of almost no spots.. one event.. gee.  AND NO THE SCIENTISTS are not PREDICTING another mini ice age.  So why does this horse shit news article say they do? just like the horse shit article in the telegraph? Because it fuels the denialism. Fuck people you can have your crappy journalism, but at least get the fucking basics right. No one fucking predicted no god damn ice age.  **NO some political fucking rag, looked at some scientists data, and decided they were going to be arm chair 'scientists'' er denialists and decided to interpret the shit for themselves, and then tell everyone thats what the scientists said.**  This has no business being here. Its denialist horse shit.    I really would like to see the left avoid making this political. Yeah the right already has, but we should link to the studies only.  what to do about it... yeha that is pure politics. But if it is happening and the science.. fuck no. You either accept reality or you dont. Science doesnt give a flying fuck about how you feel or your political orientation. Science can be a major prick that way.. just ask einstein.  but yeah i think we need to focus on pointing out that the record in 2014 that we got and the one we will likely set this year, was caused by cars and factories in 1974. It was caused by your grandparents and parents.. in a world WITH HALF AS MANY PEOPLE.  now think of the 70s.. no one had computers in the home.. you had a big ass tv.. if you were lucky there was a long ass wire attached to a little box with one big ass button on it.. that button changed the channel in the clockwise direction... that was it. There was less cars.. jet skis, boats.. less shit shipping from china.  today we got twice as many people, we use the fuck out of elect.. does anyone have a plug in their house without a an adaptor or strip to give you more sockets? how the fuck did people survive with these 2 socket pos's? they didnt use fuck for electricity.  so we got double the people.. i got fucking computer screens all over the house, when in the 70s we had one fucking tv.. one of my favority toys.. a cap gun, used no batteries.. and all that lame ass shit we did back then.. helped cause the record in 2014. Think of the people in your family in 1974.. what did thye look like, what did they do.. how did they live.. think of your life now.. if you went back in time they would think you were a fucking wizard.. ok the whole going back in time thing is a little cool, but the shit you got. You carry a library and gps and weather checker and tv watcher in your pocket.. dick tracy would jizz all over himself for one of our smart phones.  Now.. your emissions today.. all this lame ass crap we got..(in 40 years they are going to laugh at our quaint little smart phones and the shit we think is cool).. population growth.. electricity growth.. emission growth.. your emissions are going to set records for grandkids you havent even met yet.     right wingers really are a huge problem in the world today.  oh they have their uses. I'm a strong believer that both sides keep society in check.. the left are a bit too willing to look without leaping and the right are a bit too scared to leap.. together we make good choices about when to leap.   Unfortunately, society has been a bit right winger for a long time and we have a bit many problems that are antithesis to right winger ideology. Like AGW... and well when your plane is crashing and you all got parachutes.. the guy telling you to not jump is a fucking idiot and a problem. "maybe we will have a soft landing.. maybe we will land on a pile of cottom.. maybe someone will come up with a way to save the plane before it hits the ground.. we should stay here"  yeah crash and burn right wingers, just dont take the world with you.  and when yall come back to sanity, we really do need you guys.... but we need yall sane. hey use lefties have to run into that all the time.. there are some shit that we would like that just isnt affordable or doable.. thing is we generally accept that. Yall got to accept that sometimes, taxes HAVE to be raised and its nothing to do with a bunch of lazy fucks. Sometimes we have to go against your ideology.. yeah it sucks balls sometimes I KNOW.. but yall got to grin and bear it and prove your fucking adults and do the right fucking thing and by right I dont mean political right.     The big reason is the rise of compensation negotiators. And the fact that boards tend to be filled with other ceos. Scratch my back and i will scratch yours.  but yeah compensation negotiators see joe smo getting more than his client at a similar sized company and works out a massive deal  and the growth feeds on each other. Keeping up with the jones.(and really once your bills are paid, thats some of the 'worries' the rich have.. i need a bigger boat than my neighbor.. i need a better car. When my family built a home in a gated community that came out 3 inches taller than the neighbor.. they had their entire house raised by 6.. he didnt add shit.. not a loft or another floor.. he just raised his fuckin house 6 inches so it was the tallest on the block again. it must be nice to have such frivolous concerns.. and high school can be brutal on the barely rich, especially girls)  and what actually kicked things into overdrive recently.. was reporting requirements. now the negotiators have a much easier time seeing compensation across the board so they can work out even more for their ceo clients.   This is one of those times, when ALL MARKET FORCES.. you know that magical free market beast.. which ZERO GOVERNMENT encouragement(except that last part with the reporting.. but it sure as fuck didnt start this mess)... ALL market forces encourage this.   Absolutely zero in the free markets, want to stop the insane growth in ceo pay.. nothing.. in fact the exact opposite.  now with those immutable facts in mind... what do you think would be the best thing to do about this?  because you can pray to the free market fairy to fix this, but the free market fairy is right now cheering them on "PAY EM MORE!.. PAY EM MORE!!"    send it back.. they'll take it.. you will get more free    its [because the bottom doesnt know its been dropped yet](http://i.imgur.com/xfabuCc.gif) ;)   mister skeltal seems to have been dooting in /r/mildlypenis      On our side of the wall... perkers versus advertisers.. its going to be useless to contact CS.   in the start of these things, sometimes, user CS is ok.. because they need mass to start getting good ad contracts, after that, we are assigned to automation and the worst employee they got. Its just market forces. If your question is more complicated than asking how to spell perk, your better off not contacting them.  they have no compelling reason to give us good support, we are outgoing money.   anyways you are better off here. they know their shit is crashing. if it is phone/user specific, people can often help here.. well sometimes, which is 1000% more than perk support.    not really that mild but i doubt they would care  /r/mildlypenis  would enjoy.. they seem to really like this sort of thing    it's become common to quiz both men and women about their credentials and boasting is a given.  ,  The late-night talk show host Conan O'Brien, who is broadcasting live from the convention, boasted that he knows more than any fan and even took a "Comic-Con citizenship test" on his show answering questions like: "Wolverine's claws are made of which metal?"    that second part had nothing to do with them being women. well let me dial that back a little, i have seen women get more scrutiny in the past, (not at comic con, just general girls claiming to be geeks) a little less so today, so dont doubt it happens some, but the article says both go through that.   	208

This is just my guess, but I think it's b.c school is out now.  Ignorant, immature kids are bored, and have more time to be online.

You can film a commercial anywhere these days   [HAHA](http://nelson-haha.api-meal.eu/)   That's funny bc laker fans weren't using that excuse when they first signed GP and Malone.

And, this isnt legit yakiaoba.  Never seen ketchup used as a sauce   It's b.c school is out now.  Combine that with boredom and you get a shit show. It's been happening more and more every year   Kelly Dwyer is the worst   He sounded like a 5 year old many times during the post game conferences.     Way to bounce back Festus, and contribute big time in the Final game.     At no point did your comment make any sense.  Easy triple double?  Best oxymoron ever   The entire team is a bunch of outcasts.  Dray getting drafted in the 2nd, Bogut and his multiple injuries, Steph being too small.     Fuck yeah!!!!!!!   You're comparing a tweet to a post game press conference.   Literally millions of people are watching this.  This particular answer mad him sound whiny    It's called being a pro and and answering questions professionally.     Sounds like my 5 y.o nephew.     I saw one wearing the traditional garb, but wearing a Mets hat.     Recipe please   I have a hard time understanding your logic.  Your list has only 1 mention of kap. The rest of your list has to do with a new O line, weak secondary.   Yesterday's game reminded me game 2 vs Memphis.  We got flustered, and panicked a bit on shot selection.        It shows just how badly we was dinged up last year.  He had a bum shoulder as well that probably wasn't healing the way it wanted.     La Quinta inn K town.  Spectacular view of the Empire State and delicious Korean food all around you    No way, but I did live in Alameda so my commute was literally 10 minutes.  Although they sucked really bad those days, it was still really fun to go to games.    Back then you could by a upper level ticket, wait till the 3rd quarter when it was a blowout, sneak down to lower level and watch the games.  The closest I snuck down was right behind the bench.     Great question.  When GS was shitty during the 2000's, there weren't really SF Warrior fans.  There was a handful that would make the commute, but for the most part, the crowd was East Bay.    Fast forward to present day, the crowd these days is way more SF.  Also because ticket prices have increased.     One of the papers commented that this is one of the most expensive finals to date.  Whenever you have Lebron tix are going to go up.    Love this kids logic.  Has no f'n clue about Steve Kerr's dad, yet will argue as to who killed him.     Just wondering what's everyone thoughts are   I've heard splash daddy used for Kerr in the Warriors sub before   That post was entertaining, there was so much drama that day. Didnt the model from the actual photo show up and tried to ask for royalties?   Can we ask the mods to shadow ban?   He's posting on redsox quite a bit as well.  Even r/redsox is telling him to delete his account   I won't tell you to kill yourself, but I'll tell you to fuck off.  What are you still doing in this sub?    And for y'all that think that's rude.. I'll tell you why it's not.  Some of the subreddits have changed in the past few years bc of lies and false posts.  Look at r/food for instance.  All u see these days is stock photos with watermarks cropped out, and people claiming they actually made it.    The warriors sub has always been legit.  Then this charlatan comes along into our sub and trolled the shit out of us.  I don't want this guy around, pretty sure the majority does either    Well he's gonna get down voted if he ever tries to post, so I'm cool with that   Sorry, I don't share the same sentiment.  I avoid subreddits like r\food because people started to post stock photos claiming it was thier own creation.  Reddit wasn't like this 4 years ago.  It was genuine posts from real folks.  It's changed now and sometimes for the worse.  I wasn't expecting any frauds to, certainly not on this sub..    So yeah, fuck OP   This if borderline psychopath.    Hope this makes it onto best of Reddit.  Frontpage      Damn man, it's guys like you that have ruined Reddit.  The past 2-3 years this place got more popular and then shitheads like you discovered Reddit.  "Hey derp, look how cool I am!".  You got some fucking issues.  Maybe you got picked on too much in High school, not enough pussy, who knows.  But go fuck off, you should be banned from r\warriors.     Thanks I find it hilarious the lengths people go to post stock images on here.  All I wanted to know was whether OP made it or not.  Even funnier that he got gold.     I stopped lurking on r/food bc people started posting stock photos of food pics claiming they made it rather than giving credit to the original.  Never would i imagined this level of attention seeking would come to this subreddit   Playoff ball is much slower, grind it out pace.  After watching that Bogut video posted here, I was thinking the same.  That said, Mosgov is quick on his feet and can keep up with Bogut   So do you always post glamor pics w/out context?  Where is this from, recipe?  Did you make this?   And one day you might end up missing, and some shithead will make a similar comment such as yours, during a time when their friends and family are pleading with the public.     Yeah let's dismiss the playoff game in Atlanta, or outgunning Brady in Foxborough, or handling Carolina in the playoffs.       More like rye bread.  Dark on the outside, light in the inside    The debate was never about Harden sucking.  It was whether he worthy of winning the MVP over Curry.

In the bowl is a potato salad, served with rye, pumpernickel, and of course bagels      Seemed as though in the 2nd half, Fez had more of a impact than Bogut.  Other than foul trouble, and Howard being hurt, do you think Ezeli is the better play?    Just for clarification, this is not to trash Bogut.

You can run risk of cross contamination and veggies cook much faster so you won't run the risk of over cooking    2011 Justin Smith was a piece of work, lotta of the highlights of him as a 49er were that year.  That being said, I felt like last year there was a slight drop off with him.  Of course I would want him back, but it creates urgency and guys like Aldon have been stepping up big time.

Granted we overcooked the bird on occasion, but overall they didn't really get why American's had such as obsession over Turkey on Thanksgiving.     Assuming most of Reddit is young folks, but I always likened Barnes games to Jamal Mashburn.  Very similar post game, both are 6'8.  Mash had a better jumper, but Barnes ceiling is way higher.  Here's a [clip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS2B_5wDU6U)     I think in time he"ll find that mid range jumper.  What's nuts is that he's still bulking up, and could be a solid post threat later down the road.     It's another scoring option that Memphis has to pay attention to, especially if Barnes is posting Courtney lee.  Its gotta be demoralizing when you spend all your energy on trying to stop Steph and Klay, and then having Harrison come down the lane for a 2 handed dunk    I agree, he's only going to get better.  People forget how young he is.     Barnes sometimes gets heat for not being more consistent, but he was a beast in game 4.  Some of his post moves looked eerily similar to his breakout series against the Spurs a few years ago.  He's also had 4-5 monster dunks last game   Who gives a shit?  As long as we play our game, the refs will have no impact   Winning on the road is a must for championship teams.  The lakers in the early 2000s were down 2-1 in series many times and we all know how that ended.  No need to panic, I expect a game 7   Harrison looked real solid, I'm surprised they didn't run more Iso through him, especially when Lee was guarding him   You hit it straight on, I think the MVP presentation before the game got the team too hyphy.  They were jacking up quick shots, not enough ball movement.     How many times is that now?  3 times accused of cheating   Why is this considered justice?

Anytime I check out a Yelp review on a asian restaurant, I look at the face+name of the reviewer.  An asian face usually gets a little more cred.    When you got 2 of the biggest whiners in the game i.e Paul and Griffin, those technicals add up fast    Checking in from NYC!

Kerr would yank his ass in a heartbeat    Are these worth any $$?   How many more coaches are you guys going to hire and then fire?  A few years ago it was Mike Brown, then D'Antoni.  Funny how some of you would kill to have either of these guys back as coaches.     It's that and a combination of the biggest 2 floppers in the league i.e Paul and Griffin.    How is it that a power forward as big as Griffin is always on the ground?  And follow that up with Paul's whiny ass always getting tangled up with everyone?  Then these 2 have the nerve to bitch and complain.  That's why people are getting fed up with their shit and the act entitled   Thabo better good a good immigration attorney.  These kinds of acts can get you sent back to Switzerland   The guy has never worn pads or helmet, it's going to take some time getting used to.     Hey, fellow WVD!

Going against Aldridge, Ibaka, Duncan, etc he's going to be outmatched.  Also the pace of playoff basketball slows down to a lot more to half court sets, which is another knock against Lee.

I've been on this 4+ years, and once in awhile there would be a fake pic here and there.  These days, it's everywhere.  Take R/Food for instance.  It's so fake b.c of fuckers like you that it should re named R/Stockphoto.    And get off your fucking soapbox regarding what Reddit should be.  I'm not about to get lectured from some fuckwit.     I'll say it like this.  Reddit has gone to shit lately b.c of these exact posts.  R/Food became R/stockphoto because people automatically assumed OP made the food.  This wasn't so 4+ years ago, where I could see actual food posts that were real.  Just a few weeks ago, the top posts on r/food were all stock.  No description, background info, nothing.       Damn man/woman, is your self esteem that fucking low?  That's a rhetorical question.  What the fuck is wrong with you?   Reddit has gone to shit lately, and its b.c of punk asses like you.

 This is something I'll never know for sure, and I don't think I want to.   Thanks for your support, and I'm really glad you were able to get clean. I'm sober now, and I wrote this story as sort of a reflection on the mistakes I've made, and I'm really glad that the responses are so positive.   ready to rumble !   Ready to spread some Orangered blood.  Team Periwinkle!    nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;*Rock-a-bye baby, on the treetop,*   nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;*When the wind blows, the cradle will rock,*   nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;*When the bough breaks, the cradle will fall,*   nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;*And down will come baby, cradle and all.*      nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;Things arent always as they seem; one move can shatter all youve built, yet all youve built isnt always deliberate. My brain is muddled with the mistakes I have made, will make and am making. Ive always had so much, I still dobut the more I have the less wholesome it feels. My eyes used to be filled with light, colour, and significancenow I am shadowed by the constant euphoria.   nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;Euphoria:- a feeling or state of intense excitement and happiness.    nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;Euphoria used to mean thatgood thingsbut now it consumes me. It grew steadily; started as a slight nagging and grew to a beast, taking bites out of me with every inhalation. I still remember the day that it all started, the day that I broke the last straw, lost the last emotion; the day I made the mistake of walking home after my graveyard shift.      nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;Trust me, lady, the shady man from the alley said as he grabbed my armit wasnt hard but it was far from gentlewhispering with heavy breaths, I can see it in your eyes.    nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;I need to go, I shuddered in response; I was so scared, so unfamiliar.    nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;You's sad, I can see it, I know what you need, lady, trust me, he went on, shoving a bag in my face, *this* is the stuff you need. I started to become frustrated, I mean, there was a smelly, shady young man whispering in my ear about some drug; little did I know, he would become my saviour.    nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;I dont think *hallucinations*, are going to help me put my life back together, I spat. Oh, the irony! I thought I had hit rock bottom back then, I didnt know of the trenches lying ahead of me.    nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;No, lady, heroin isnt like that. You wont hallucinate like MDMA or LSD; its a nice friendly drug. he explained, this shit doesnt get you high, or screw you up, everything thing is just mellow, and happythe world is beautiful. That was the point where I was starting to become convinced, you could smoke it at home, smoke it at work; heroin doesnt create, it *erases.* Sold, at the drop of a hat. That manwhom I now know as Trey, or in situations Ive tried to repress, *babe*knew how to use his words to manipulate me into doing whatever he pleased, a skill that proved useful to him later on. I revisited that alleyway 47 times after the fact, but I met Trey himself 164 timesour relationship evolved from simply the purchase and sale of heroin. At the time, it wasnt manipulation, it was rescue: I was lonely, depressed, and barely managing to maintain a dead-end waitressing job; Trey showed me the drug that dissolved all my negativity, and his own presence dispersed my loneliness. What I now realize was the exploitation of resources seemed at the time to be real, maybe my rationality was altered by the heroin, but I felt the most sane Ive ever been. Nine times out of ten, I would go somewhere with Trey and smoke the stash Id bought *with* him, when I could only afford less but what I needed was more, he would even share some of his. I was so young and so stupid; I thought thats what love was, *sharing your heroin.* God, I was so stupid.     nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;It didnt take long for me to fall in what I thought was love, but could you blame me? I was being provided with powdered happiness, the only thing I was really living for. I never realized that I had never spent a night with him sober; I made him priority, my moments with him were the only moments that mattered. To him, I was simply a customer, and then a sex toyI was never a human being. Yet night after night I texted him over and over, smoked with him, made love to himthe cycle continued for months, and I loved it, but every thing must come to an end. A rude awakening, clichd and yet the most unexpected thing to ever happen: I was pregnant; I missed my period the last month. At first, I brushed it off as a side effect of the alien substance running through my veins, but in a burst of rationality I got myself tested. I kept smokingbut I started to get careful, only smoking once a week, then once every two, however, I could never bring myself to really stop, why didnt I stop? About 3 months in, I told Treywell, I didnt tell him, he noticed my hesitance and then my stomach, and with my lack of comprehensible response, he caught on.    nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;Youre goddamn pregnant, he mumbled one day, obviously numbed by the drugs, you cant smoke my shit anymore. I saw it as an act of care, a muted I love you, but to him it was just a lost customer, lost money. In a stroke of epiphany my saviour and my enemy all at once developed another business idea. If you smoke it, the baby gets all the drugs, he spoke confidently, making me believe he had some medical knowledgealthough, I would have believed anything from him at that point, but if you inject it just stays in *your* blood. Brilliant, absolutely brilliant; take my pregnancy and turn it into an investment, sell me more expensive drugs, take me even further down the rabbit hole. I never stopped doing heroin throughout my pregnancy. Trey left a few months later, as soon as he found out there wasnt going to be an abortion, as soon as found out this was as much his responsibility as it was mine. He may have moved across the country or across the street, I didnt know, but he blocked my calls and I gave up. I found another dealer, and I gave up. Thats how I know it wasnt love on my part either, at least not love for the man, but for his produce.    nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;I was dedicated to that drug, so dedicated that I never thought more ahead than the next morning, I never thought about what I was doing to myself. I took 20 hits of heroin a day in my last trimester; I needed that much to handle the side effects of pregnancy. I half-expected the baby to die before I had to care for itbut it was stronger than I. April 26th8 months and 23 days of pregnancyI went into labour. The pain covered my entire body to such an extent that not even the heroin could make it stop; I felt almost helpless, I had no *human* friends to guide me. I knew only one thing coming into thisand its implications:  1.  I have no money  * I cannot afford to go to the hospital  * I cannot afford to raise this baby   nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;Despite my long-term patronage to heroin, there remained sparse drops of sanity within me, and through those I determined that my only option was to keep the child. It was through those drops that I also realized the health of the baby would not be substantial, in fact, it is miraculous that the foetus remained to grow throughout the entire gestation period; the baby will be severely messed up if it survives birth. I had gotten myself into a situation that had no upside, but due to the influence I was under, I was so goddamn calm. I hadnt a clue what I was to do, yet I hadnt a crap to giveor perhaps a better way to explain was that I hadnt the ability to feel, everything had a silver lining, even if it didnt.     nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;I birthed the baby on my living room floor; I chose to do so because the carpeting was a deep maroon, therefore any stains would not be overly detrimental. He came out blue and silent, but he wasnt deadhe was also not normal. He was ugly, it was so ugly. I knew for a fact such aesthetic could only stem from deformity, there was a muddled order of the features on its face, features that were not mine. This is not a child I felt the want or need to keep in my home, nor did I have the means of doing so. In what I thought was an excellent plan, I took the baby to the cool darkness outside of my home, and settled him gently on the floor. Using the materials around me I fashioned an intricate cradle of sticks and leavessturdier than concreteand gently hung it upon the branch of a tree, low enough that I could just reach it. Gently, I placed the baby in its new cradle; I had the urge to kiss the baby goodbye, to feel any compassion, but the feeling was too easy to dismiss. In that moment, I had justified my own decision; if I didnt love the baby, nobody would. I would visit it in the morning to feed and comfort it, I would keep the baby alive so not to be deemed a murderer; everything made so much sense.   nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;I woke up the next morning, exceedingly sober. The implications of my actions slowly trickled into the back of my mind, like a drop of blood down my scalp. *I gave birth last night, while high, and I left the baby in a forest.* Glancing at the clock I noticed it had only been a few hours, I hoped to salvage the situation. That was the first morning in a very long time in which my primary thought had not been heroin. Running outside, it hit me that it was much too late; there was no possibility of a happy ending. By the trees I noticed what I though was a cradle and now realized is nothing but a pile of sticks and junk on the floor, stained slightly browner than its surroundings. The overwhelming smell of loss encompassed me as I lifted the cradle away, revealing what was underneath. The foetus was covered in blood, skull cracked open, unmistakably dead. In my delusion, I did not witness myself hang a baby to a tree with some sticks, I did not realize how far my life had crashed downwards, how much I had ruined myself, I did not know that down would come baby, *cradle and all.*   Alas, it is morning, now we await the hint.   Any tips?    if you replace each pair with its new number value (frequency) you get:  462746274614 461546272 4615227 4614462719 19275 461546271927 46141915 19275 4631927 4615463 461446274627 4614192746 19275 46144614 4615463 4614192746 46141915 4614462719 19275 4615461446 461546271927 46151914 461546272 4614462719 461546154627 4615227 4614192746 461519274627 191 19275   Since OP said looking at frequency is a good idea, I looked at how many times each pair was repeated.  A0 = 46 A1 = 27  B0 = 19 B1 = 15  C0 = 2 C1 = 14  D0 = 2 D1 = 3  E0 = 5 E1 = 0  F0 = 0 F1 = 1  idk maybe this means something   Qatar Airways. A group of teenagers was flying alone from Doha to Washington DC and their connecting flight had to land in a country two hours away because of a little drizzle. We then proceeded to miss our flight to DC and the airline took essentially zero responsibility. It took 3 hours to get tickets on the next flight and then we were informed we would be contracted regarding accommodation. They gave other passengers meal vouchers but none to us and we were not contacted about accommodation.. When seeking it for ourselves all rooms were booked to other passengers who arrived 5 hours after our group did. Then, we were not even provided with blankets as we slept on the airport floor for 24 hours and received complaints from staff.... Again, this was a group of teenagers alone... NEVER AGAIN.

 So you're in agreement with Obama, then?   Something's off about them.

Let this be a lesson to all of you.  Always hire professionals, never do anything without a signed contract up front, a deposit and a lawyer's blessing.  Work with a legitimate agent and manager.  Communicate with everyone you know about what your plans are.  Leave your cell phone number, itinerary with your manager and check in ever 30 minutes when on a "shoot".  Never travel alone to a shoot.  Always go with a friend, your agent, a parent, a trusted companion.  Always have a backup "plan b" incase it goes wrong.

I think cheating is wrong, but I don't think society should punish cheaters, rather I think it's up to the couple to question the reason why they are together, and be honest about it.  For example, my wife and I lived together for almost 8 years before we were married.  I was working at the military base and a teaching hospital in Seoul, South Korea.  We enjoyed being together.  We had lots of sex, traveled all over the world and rarely ever talked about marriage and children.  Eventually, we decided we were ready to talk about children and then we formed a legal bond in order to protect them (we got married).  We had five children together, one died in a car accident in 1995.  We have three sons and one daughter, and seven grandchildren.  I'm not saying ours was the way to do it, just saying that if you're up front with the person you are with about what you hope to get out of the relationship (sex, partnership, money, security, family, travel partner, etc), then you will last longer.

I guess 27 people still haven't seen it LOL            because prayer works   63 year old MD here (raises hand).  Dieting doesn't work long term.  If you want to see your daughter all grown up, the #1 best thing for you is walking.  Every day.  60 minutes or more.  Uphill.  Get your heart rate up to 150 or more.  If you want, you can try to keep your calorie intake down to 2,000 a day.  1. Breakfast is the most important meal of the day.  Make instant oatmeal cereal (get the bucket of plain oatmeal, cook it in a little pot, covered with water.  you can toss in a handful of nuts (protein) and raisins (sweetener).  Serve it with plain nonfat yogurt and fresh fruit.  Water for beverage.  2.  Lunch: skinless/boneless chicken or turkey is easy to cook - get the breasts or leg pieces, throw a few in a pan with olive oil, garlic or onion and mix up a big bowl of salad greens, fresh tomato, cukes, shaved carrots, whatever you like.  Put the chicken on top and serve with home-made salad dressing.  I take a bowl and mix 1/3 cider vinegar (or red wine vinegar), 2/3 extra virgin olive oil, 1 tsp onion powder, "italian seasonings" to taste, mustard and salt to taste.  Takes 2 minutes to make and tastes delicious.  Beverage: water.  3.  Dinner.  Something light - soba noodles with veggies is a personal favorite, or kimbap or even bibimbap.  Beverage: water or a glass of red wine.  Dessert: fruit.     wow no shit. you live in the falls area?   that's what /b/ is for   Voat rhymes with bloat and smells like my boat   Amherst         I remember when the internet started.  I got my first desktop computer in 1987.  It was an 80/88 with dual 5.25" floppy drives, no hard drive and ran DOS.  My brother in law at the time gave me a 500mb hard drive for my birthday and helped me install it.  It came with a 13" color monitor.  A couple years later, I "upgraded" to a 386 with GEOS gui OS.  Kind of like Windows, but cuter.  It came with AOL, which, at the time, was the only way to get online.    A lot has changed in the years since.  I think the #1 thing I disliked from the beginning was any spam or advertising.  You could see it from a distance and avoid it pretty easily back then.  When the first adblockers came out (they were individual programs you had to install on your hard drive), I used them all.  Now you can easily install extensions in Firefox and Chrome and there are dozens to choose from...also blocking facebook and google tracking, hiding your IP/Location and much more.  I use them all.  I don't want to be tracked or sold to.  Never did and that is never going to change.   Nah that's just my general demeanor.  I'm a cranky old man.  I'll retire in 2 years, buy an RV then you'll never hear from me again :)   I live in western Mass...anything east of Worcester is Boston :)      I don't have to do shit, you little turd      4chan, anyone?  yes?  no?   Aliens?  Do they walk among us?  Have they been here all along (as some would have us believe)?  If so, what do they want?   He means /r/conspiracy mods, not Reddit Admins.  There's a huge difference.   no   I wonder how many water filters Alex Jones and his ilk sold during this latest "DOOM" theater?   tl;dr "be nice to cops"   Because Google Sky is legit and they don't make anything up!   Hmm...just did an alt media search and msm search and only found the reports from the local news already reported below.  Nothing about Jade Helm.  I suspect (and this is just me reading between the lines), some conspiratard right wing Alex Jones Infoliars looney went off his rocker and decided to take out the govmint before they took him out.   how about some links to actual sources instead of your "facts"   This is why I don't like most redditors like you.  They jump to conclusions and never give anyone the benefit of the doubt.  Take this whole Ellen Pao thing.  Someone didn't have the whole story, but made up the parts they didn't know about (that Pao fired Virginia), the whole site blew up and everyone was against her, forcing her to resign.  Turns out it was someone else named Alexis who fired Virginia, and it had nothing to do with Pao.  Keep it up.  You're what's shitty about the world today.   Yeah sorry about the Paywall :(   it's not statistics.  It's observation   Wednesday, July 15, 2015  (Published in print: Thursday, July 16, 2015)   It is very real.         https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZP1nV1fFrw            I did no such thing            I didn't say legally.  I work in an ER.  99% of my patients are illegal aliens.  They all have drivers licenses, cars, iphones, medical insurance (well ok some of them have insurance), some of them own businesses (3 oriental markets in western MA are owned by illegals - not giving out names).  I didn't say legal.              you should make a meme out of that ;)      http://wonkette.com/590978/iran-nuclear-deal-will-either-usher-in-new-era-of-peace-or-end-of-civilization-as-we-know-it   probably got ninjas in there   http://talkingpointsmemo.com/livewire/best-jade-helm-parody-ever   http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/07/15/volunteer-watchdog-group-prepares-for-counter-jade-helm-campaign/   http://www.shtfplan.com/headline-news/jade-helm-begins-massive-direct-training-for-future-civil-unrest-in-america_07152015   http://www.conspiracyclub.co/2015/07/15/jade-helm-15-begins-2/   Today (Wednesday, July 15, 2015) is the first day of "Jade Helm", Obama's supposed take over of the USA.  Post any JH links in this thread.            It's Digg/Reddit all over again...this time the Diggtards are fleeing in boatloads to voat...   Asian women are all so hot.  Asian men look like frogs.  Why is that?  Are they the same species?   Well that's pretty stupid.  I guess she doesn't remember [Herb Alpert](https://i.imgur.com/t4AcUyv.jpg)          but if we're assholes, you can ignore us   I suspect those people will vote for Trump :)   Nobody's comparing Jeb Bush to Obama LOL.  Why not compare him to say, Trump, who is #1 in the polls currently.   It's not reliable and there's no way to share to it using any of the standard methods (probably a good thing - cuts down on spammers and prolific sharees like me)   That is all.   Although /r/conspiracy is not an actual "hate" subreddit, I wouldn't put it past the new CEO and the board to get rid of it eventually.        http://spacemath.gsfc.nasa.gov/Algebra1/3Page7.pdf         Here it comes: The Great Censorship, they will call it.  You thought Ellen Pao was bad?  Just wait         All of my kids are adults with their own families.  When we retire, we'll take our life savings, buy an RV and spend our last few years driving around this beautiful country.     flavored water tastes great and has zero calories      I wouldn't use the term "falling apart", but yes, not having direct access to their hormones on a daily basis will result in a significant mental and emotional hazard                           Because it's a shitty site?   North Korea is about as useless as Donald Trump, and entertaining!   Hmm...pretty bad design to rely on diesel generators that could short out by ocean water, then building the whole thing so close to the ocean         I agree he's probably not serious.  He loves center stage and like he says, he's got all the time and money in the world to be there for a while...he gets to talk about things he wants, and people have to take him seriously...whether or not he's a false flag for Billary, I can't say.  I do think he's trolling the GOP, however   THis is nothing new.  Come on people.  You can't be a regular member of /r/conspiracy and not know this already.  The people that need to know about this are the sheeple that watch Faux news and CNN   Benjamin Fulford talked a lot about this on his blog 5 or 10 years ago.    Just do a Startpage search for "benjamin fulford new world order putin china brics" and you'll see the articles I'm talking about.  This was planned all along.    But what does it matter?  Unless you're the CEO of a major corporation, or a the head of a Union or something, there's not much you can do and it won't affect you all that much.  I'm assuming most of you guys are young, probably in your 20s, maybe 30s, correct?  I'll be 65 in 2 years and then I'll retire and be on my merry way.  I guess if you're under 30, you'll be living in an interesting time.  You'll be seeing some strange things happening in the market.  Me on the other hand, I'll be dead.      Millenials (people born after 1985) are living at home with mom and dad.  They are not buying homes and they don't have good jobs.  They have HUGE student loan payments/debt and almost zero cash flow.  That means they are not buying cars or refrigerators or any of the big ticket items.  And the boomers (people born 1945-1963) are dying off.  By 2020, almost 76,000,000 people will be unable to make any sort of large purchases...  That leaves people born between 1964-1985, sometimes called Generation X.  This is the generation that can afford to buy stuff.  And there's only 82,000,000 of you.  The American birth rate is way down.  Millenials can't afford to leave mom and dad's homes, they can't get married and they don't have jobs.  That means they are not having kids.  We're shit out of luck unless we do something drastic.          The guy is fearless because he thinks his god, Xenu, the scientology god, is going to save him      except Ellen was the "interim" CEO   at least the updates are relevant.           I wonder to what extent was Ellen aware that they were using her as a scapegoat?  She seemed genuinely distraught about the result of all of this.  She replied to my first message, but not my second, which means she's probably quit Reddit altogether, and who can blame her?  I doubt she'll be back.  I didn't read all of the vitriol posted about her, but I guarantee you, even an old fart like me would be devastated if even a percentage of that were directed at me!  As to your comment about her being an Asian and Female, I remember early articles where details about her relationship with a married "black" male were cooked up.  This is meant to light a fire in certain circles where Asians and Blacks should never mix.  To a skeptic like me, this kind of negative press early on set the stage for people's dislike for her, that somehow she was not to be trusted.  Of course they presented no evidence in these articles.  And I prefer to give people the benefit of the doubt.   And your proof of that is...?      Childish   and what's your point?    it's called forum sliding.  every large forum has it      I always gave her the benefit of the doubt from the start.  I guess the difference between me and a lot of the haters is that I'm skeptical by default.  I'm also a lot older than most Redditors, so I have a different perspective.         And white Irish slaves      I don't care.  Here's a downvote for boring me with this nonsense   Why do you voatards keep coming on here as if we care about voat?  I care about as much as I care about any other site that's not reddit.  And that's not much at all   A couple of them look slightly different, but I was inclined to think that also (hence my title)      It's a still from this newsreel: https://youtu.be/lA1IYsJLkNI?t=1m25s               Obviously I believe you're incorrect, otherwise I wouldn't have posted it.  I'm hardly a troll.  I think it's a genuine question that a lot of people think.  For those of you who are not aware, 84% of American citizens are religious, something like 79% of them are Christians.  That's 286 million Christians in the US alone.  I guarantee you, ever single one of them is asking this question.  Now you may think they are nuts, silly, or just plain wrong, and I would agree with you generally.  But how are you going to change their minds?    It's a topic worth discussing in greater detail and just removing my post because you think it's "trolling" or "disrespectful" just buries a potentially worth-while discussion in my personal and professional opinion!     me or the article   Are you saying I am an idiot, or this man is an idiot?  I am an atheist, by the way, which you would know if you read my comments   So which part of religion is bullshit in your opinion?      https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IHtY5ONeDM   Why would you post a picture of your child onto the world's worst website (full of pedos and porn?

If somebody is talking to you about their depression, DON'T try to come up with solutions to make them "not depressed." It's an illness like any other that can only be treated professionally. Just listen to them and offer them something to eat or drink (not alcohol). But, one thing you must DO is be aware of any talk of intent to commit suicide. If they start talking about it get them to the ER stat.      Was she a hot retard?   goofball.com, this guy with a vagina is getting double dildo fucked by a real girl.

    Before the Alou brothers came along, there was a joke about how many wins brothers who pitched in the major leagues had together, that "Cy Young and his sister have them all beat."   "There was also a large horse in the room, taking up most of it."   I had two Skype interviews for a job last year and put on a full suit for both, even dress shoes. I didn't have to prove it, but I did get the job.   The "professional-looking dude not wearing pants" thing is sort of a comedy trope; it's been applied to news anchors, judges, etc. If either party is a woman then the under- and overtones shift too far. When it's just guys then it can work if employed advisedly.   A couple of years ago I met a recruiter at a conference and we hit it off immediately. At some point he asked me a somewhat personal question and I answered without a flinch. Then he said, "I probably also shouldn't ask this, but are you wearing panties?"  I said, "Who told you about my panties?" and he busted out laughing.  The job and I weren't right for each other, but I would have loved working with that guy.   I once heard a woman who did photo sets and videos say she got a request for a custom set of pix of her bare foot on the accelerator of a fast sports car. Nothing else, just a bunch of shots like that. She said she threw in a nude pic just because it seemed strange not to.   At the gym:  Me: I'm doing pretty good for an old fat guy.  Young woman: You're not old!   Hahaha I told some friends tonight about this thread and then said "Some--" and three of them started singing "-body once told me" right away.   I loved the approach of one of my friends when her first grandbaby arrived: "I'm not showing any photos because she just looks like all the other babies. I'll wait till she looks more individual."   Sleeper   Six Days Seven Nights   "He's a really nice guy, he's never cheated on his wife before, he wants to be with me instead of her, he's just waiting for her to ask for a divorce."   [Moskau.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAz50pZn6Ys)   What I love about that song is that so often people agree that it uses "irony" wrong but don't agree on how to use it correctly.   [This bit from Fawlty Towers stirred controversy.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ns0uRr6aPQE)   Yes! Also, mix it with baking soda and a little crushed oregano and it's a good underarm antiperspirant/deodorant. I tried this combo in the downstairs region too, but it seemed to cause irritation so I switched back to just cornstarch for that area.   [Yo mama so dense she displaces liquid osmium.](http://amultiverse.com/comic/2013/06/24/dozens-revisited/)   I saw something similar with a bicycle chained to a post. IIRC the white guy got ignored, the black guy got the cops called on him (and harassed in the meantime), the white woman got helped.   I had a similar experience as I finished college -- the CIA has lots of non-secret jobs collecting and analyzing data, and they were on campus interviewing for some of them. It seemed pretty normal. At the time the job didn't seem all that interesting and I didn't have the wits to see it as an entry to more engaging stuff, so I never pursued it.   Muffin Paul. Something tells me I won't get the action-hero roles.   It is quite subtle, in fact; it actually *means* "Bless your heart."   This. I think of grapes as sugar pills.   Wow, no matter how long I watch it I only see two cycles.   I read a lot about the online world before I could afford a computer, so my introduction was gradual; I knew a couple of people on BBSs and they showed me around a little.  Funny story: While gathering information I learned about the WELL, so I called their office (this would be about '94) and asked someone to send me an info packet. He sounded very apologetic when he said "I'll be sending this through the mail, so it will take a couple of days to reach you. Is that OK?"   Linguistics overlaps with anthropology, but it's not a subset of it. We can use each one to understand the other better, which is way cool.   I speak some French, and when I first saw Kreyol written down it was pretty much the same experience.   The main characters in *Orphan Black*. Seriously, more than once I've watched the credits and wondered why they left out several of the actresses.   This will probably not be seen, but ... someone said something interesting to me along these lines, relating to a discussion about young people's impressions of 9/11: that we miss out on that gray area between current events and taught history that happens in our youth.   Adults don't usually talk to kids about the news of the day, and news sources aren't usually very accessible to children. And by the time those things are set down in history books, a microgeneration has missed learning about them. Then by the time the child is adult, no other adult is going to say to them, "Let's discuss the history and context of 9/11."  My high school history classes said little about the Vietnam War, and most of what I "learned" in later years came from movies; if Hollywood hadn't mined that vein so thoroughly I probably still would be in the dark about it.* People born in the mid-1970s probably know little to nothing about the Reagan era, which was a very formative period for me. And so on. And as far as I know we don't examine these generational lacunae much, if at all.  *as opposed to mostly knowing the movie version, which is just a different form of ignorance.   Thanks for the details! I couldn't remember what it's called. Obviously you don't see it used in typewriters much anymore, of course, but you're right, it's still common for other things.   What /u/spacejack_ said: Sony didn't license the Betamax format to other companies, so if you wanted a Beta player you had to buy Sony. JVC licensed the VHS format so anyone could make one, and competition pushed prices down.  For years after Betamax left the consumer market it was still in wide use in video production. Until digital video finally won out, if you saw a TV news crew on the street they probably had Betamax cameras.  The same dynamic happened between Apple and Microsoft in the 1980s; Apple's products were better in a lot of ways, but they were the only source, so for a long time they were just a niche player.   I thought it was called the whump-whump.   When cassettes started getting popular in the early 1980s the 8-track died out pretty quickly. My sister, a year older than me, had an 8-track player, but I never did.   Operators didn't provide recommendations, but in the '80s I heard ads for phone services of that nature. Never used one myself so I can't say more about them.   There is such a thing (besides carbon paper), two or three sheets attached together at one end like Post-Its, with something on the back of the top one that creates the image of the letters on the bottom one. You still see this with handwritten receipts where you get a copy and the business keeps one; they're usually different colors, white and yellow and, if there's a third one, pink. Duplicate bank checks, too.   That was fun, yes.    That's an interesting point, that the Ferengi in DS9 were the atypical ones, which did make them interesting as characters in the context of the series. But every time the setting shifted to Ferengenar it was just painful. I get that they wanted Quark and Rom to have some sort of depth and character arcs, but this just seemed farcical and didn't really respect them.   Also true.   I was going to say "Every Ferengi episode" but that doesn't even qualify as an interesting concept. The Ferengi are OK in episodes where they're antagonists, but the on-world political and Quark's-family crap was unbearable.   Very much agreed. I thought new-BSG was what Voyager should have been. And their resources were actually nearly unlimited -- "We have a full complement of shuttles." Really? They keep getting destroyed and you just replicate more?  I also thought Year of Hell would have made a great Doctor Who arc with the payoff happening by design instead of accidentally.   Sneakers. Most underrated spy/caper movie ever.   "Let's go to Dunkin Donuts when other options are available."   Sorry to be late replying. My university had an Office of Study Abroad and I basically walked in and asked what was available. If your school doesn't have something like that, ask a professor of your favorite foreign language what resources they know about.   Make plans to study abroad. A full year would be best, but a semester or even just a month will do you a world of good (literally). I did a year in France and gained a hell of a lot of perspective on my life and other people's.   This also ensures that the prof knows you by name and face, so if you ever need a letter of reference for a scholarship or internship, the prof will be able to provide one. If you're just another name and row of test scores on the roster, forget it.   Can sort of confirm. I once was stuck at the airport when my flight was delayed and finally canceled till the next day. The only hotel with a room was a Marriott ("When You're Stuck At The Airport, You're Stuck With Us"), and the nice desk person seemed to really really not want to charge me the full rate, but I didn't have anything that gave a discount (no AAA etc.). Clearly she had virtually no flexibility from the bosses. She did comp my breakfast buffet the next morning, I guess that counts as an upgrade.    Yep, they're in the hipster parts of Austin. I realize that's not everyone's idea of a "great" neighborhood, but it's not unsafe like the point of the thread.   [Disappointing Gay Best Friend](http://disappointinggaybestfriend.tumblr.com/) is hilarious.   Edited it down to five.   In my hometown whenever there was some big event with crowds, this one guy would dress up as Waldo and just go there and walk around. Kids loved "finding" him.   I never send personal email on my work account, and I generally don't send it through any other account from my work computer and don't use the office Wi-Fi. Same with Reddit and Facebook. I must look a bit odd checking email on my phone at my desk, but I like the compartmentalization. These seem like simple precautions, but I can't believe how many people do that stuff.   Empire State Building.   Singular they.   mmm petrichor   These, only the miniature ones. I once brought a bag to work for occasional bites. At some point I thought "Well, I should stop eating these and save the leftover ... three?? ... for later."   Eh. I've taken Greyhound a lot, and I have no horror stories. My fellow passengers have tended to be among the downtrodden, but they have generally been nice folks. The main problems have been with the bus itself -- breaking down, running late, etc. And that doesn't happen all that often.  Now, I finally quit taking the bus once when I traveled to Nebraska in December and a blizzard hit the entire Great Plains; I had to stay days longer than I had planned because even after the roads were cleared, the "upstream" highways were still closed and the buses couldn't get there.  I still take the bus for short hops, like NYC-DC.   No one has said J-Law? She's incredibly talented and gets great roles.   Came here to say this. Sooo powerful.   Mine too, now. Kind of amazing, really.  	59
 This paper shows that many of the benefits of caloric restriction (CR) seen in animal studies translated to people. After 2 years they showed - improved insulin sensitivity, 10% weight loss, decrease in cholesterol and triglycerides and decreased blood pressure.  Perhaps more importantly they showed a good level of adherence to CR (82% of subjects completed the 2 years). A key issue with CR is getting people to maintain CR so showing good adherence is pretty big. However, the target level of CR (25% decrease) was not maintained for 2 years but most maintained a CR of 10% suggesting that the more chronic CR typically used in animals is not needed in humans.      I've only read the abstract so not 100% sure on the methodology but there's nothing groundbreaking or novel from their results and conclusions here:  1. Healthy men were given a high fat diet with the same number of calories as a "normal" diet.  2. Study 1 showed that after 5 days of being on the high fat diet no changes in insulin sensitivity or metabolism (not sure exactly what they measured) occurred. If you just took this at face value (ignoring the short treatment time etc.) you might think that a high fat diet has no effects on those markers.  3. Study 2 shows that changes are occurring at the molecular level (study 1 is more of a whole tissue measure). In general they are saying that markers of inflammation (endotoxin) increase (which is thought to contribute to diabetes onset and progression). P38 is a kinase (a protein that can phosphorylate and change the behaviour of other proteins) and is involved in many process including insulin resistance, glucose uptake and can be activated in response to inflammation. The phosphorylation (a marker of its activity) of p38 is altered with the high fat diet and may contribute to the metabolic and transcript (gene expression changes) changes.  4. Overall the study is saying that molecular events that lead to impaired insulin sensitivity and/or insulin resistance are started with 5 days of the high fat diet but it's not enough time for it to manifest into actual insulin resistance.   The key for this is that it is in elderly/older (over 55yrs old) adults. Whey increases muscle protein synthesis but this effect diminishes with age. Increasing leucine can help overcome the smaller increase seen with age.   Vitamin D3 can help synergize with whey and leucine to increase protein synthesis (in vitro at least). Vitamin D3 is important for calcium homeostasis and typically decreases with age. Vitamin D3 deficiency also increases rates of protein breakdown and decreases satellite cell renewal which can translate to lower muscle regeneration/impaired muscle maintenance.  If you did this with a person in their 20s then it might be that whey alone is sufficient but this is definitely not the case in the elderly population.   I think somebody will start a company assuming they can get FDA or equivalent approval. It's not the technically challenging and marketing it as anti-aging therapy means you can charge ridiculous prices. There are companies who will isolate stem cells from you and keep them, so in the future you can have your own cells injected back into you. Taking blood is far simpler and cheaper (they could take some from a younger person and inject them into you) so there may be a company who does it but I've not heard of one.   Ethically it is questionable as you will be diverting donated blood for anti-aging purposes from those who need blood transfusions for more immediate health issues. I'm not sure how common blood shortages are nowadays (it's likely region dependent) so perhaps it might not be as big an issue as a few years ago. Additionally, giving blood transfusions for a process that has yet to been shown to work in humans (going from mice to humans is a big step) is also ethically questionable.   The study they're referring to wasn't called into question (i.e. injecting young blood into older animals/parasymbiosis reverses aging - this has been a repeatable finding). A lot of research, like the linked article, is now trying to finding out what specific proteins/hormones/factors have the beneficial effect.  The paper you're thinking of was about the role of GDF-11 in being a "rejuvenating" growth factor/ a protein that can reverse aspects of aging. Basically, one group (amy Wagers) said that GDF-11 could reverse age-related declines in muscle regeneration but a recent more thorough study (by David Glass) pretty comprehensively showed that not to be case (differences in methodology etc. might be behind the contrasting results). So the role of GDF-11 being the main factor in young blood that "reverses" aging was called into question but not the fact that young blood can reverse aspects of aging.  As somebody posted, the negative effects of this might be on the immune system. Future studies will be needed to see what adverse effects might occur and to determine if there are ways to get around it/alternative targets etc. Like most good initial studies it leaves more questions than answers at this stage :)         The effect of myostatin on muscle growth is well known and well characterized. Natural variation in the myostatin gene have evolved in certain breeds of animals that have effectively led to the absence of myostatin and an increase in muscle size. The scientists in this piece are aiming to use CRISPR or Talen gene editing techniques to knockout myostatin and increase muscle yield from animals such as pigs. This in turn should/could increase the efficiency of meat production (i.e. more meat per animal)  Whilst gene editing has it's own ethical concerns, myostatin knockout animals can exhibit behavioral changes (increased timidity) and can develop health problems much earlier - as they seem to be seeing in the pigs. By creating a haplosufficient (i.e. half a working myostatin gene) animal they may be able to overcome the negative effects of a complete myostatin gene knockout.  The use of gene editing has been getting a lot of interest and it's use in agriculture is something that might be part of the future.      For those wondering about the methodology:  The study used neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES), basically electrodes are placed on the skin and impulses sent to induce muscle contraction. Previous studies using this method have shown that it induces far greater muscle damage than a voluntary contraction (e.g. http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1113/jphysiol.2007.128827/abstract). There a few reasons why this is thought to happen but there is no clear consensus in the field and it's likely due to several factors which I won't get into.  This means that during a workout you won't get nearly as much muscle damage as in this study (in the study linked about 40% of fibres were damaged with NMES compared to 10% with voluntary contraction). After 4 days force was decreased by ~20% in this study, I doubt any workout decreases your force production by 20% 4 days later - even with lots of eccentric exercises.  Several studies have shown the benefits of BCAA's for improving protein synthesis, muscle mass and performance and this study doesn't do anything to disprove/dispute that. They were looking at severe muscle damage not exercise-induced muscle damage.   Good point, human cardiac progenitor cells (from human ES/IPSC lines) have been shown to be functional within 2 weeks in 3D culture (in fibrin or collagen gels) so their protocol to get cardiac progenitors might not be optimized to generate functional tissue. They just said that the cardiac progenitors were a gift from a company in the paper so it's hard to know how good/differentiated the cells were when seeded.   Thanks for the reply!   It's interesting that they only had function (i.e. contraction in response to electrical impulses and electrical propogation) when they used a cardiomyocyte cell line (HL-1 or H9C2) and that the human cardiac progenitors were not functional. Several groups generate their own cardiac progenitors from ES cells and get good functional tissue so it's unclear why the cardiac progenitors here were not functional - anybody have any idea?  Also their cardiac progenitors and mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) were unable to remodel the matrix which is a bit odd. It was cool to see differences in gene expression in R vs L ventricle and the endothelial cells seemed to home in to where the endothelial cells were beforehand.  Their claim of mature calcium dynamics is a bit overstretched, they didn't measure maximum capture rate, action potential duration or state the actual conduction velocities (in the discussion they said that they were below that of native cardiac muscle - which is to be expected especially for the cell line, but just showed a representative optical map and never said what it was).  I think their claims were a little overexaggerated from the physiology point of view but using decellularized human heart and showing the responses they saw is a first step forward.    	11
 From the sidebar, he is Scheduled for an AMA here   Ray Billings - Tombstone - July 22nd 10PM ET / 7PM PT   Removed as a consideration for others.  Even though you used spoiler tags, they don't work on mobile devices.  If you want to talk about this better to use a spoiler flared post with a title describing the nature of what you are speculating here but not actually revealing anything..      e.g. This post seems good for heavy speculation around teasers and trailers https://www.reddit.com/r/battlebots/comments/3dzrwf/potential_spoilerdid_abc_show_us_the_winner/         Our automoderator kills low karma accounts to fight problem users.   I've manually approved your comment here and will do so as I see them.  You may have this problem in a lot of subreddits.  So better go karmawhore or get a new account!   Someone try and mention /r/Battlebots. It was kind of missing from the last two /r/IAMA.   It is always good to get some fresh-blood from the defaults visiting here.  I have a feeling this AMA might do well given the excitement from the last episode.   This sub is for discussing public information around battlebots.    If people want to post a reaction after something has been broadcast, I can't see any problem with that and encourage it.     The only time spoiler flairs are really  used and people are asked to be  careful about titles is when people are discussing trailers and teasers leading upto the  broadcast of an episode.     Other spoilers like results of matches gleaned from inside information are prohibited.     It shouldn't be.  There is a spoiler flair for that.  I don't even think it is was a  spoiler as it appeared after the broadcast.  So removed it now anyway   Thank for posting. If you want to advertise a live stream , I would prefer you do it in the comments of the live thread or other comment sections.    full episode streaming links tend to get removed as posts because they don't support a discussion.  Your post here is now removed .      You posted this 7 days ago.  I tend not to allow posts that are direct links to episodes whatever the source as they don't create a discussion.  So  feel free to post about it in comments as a response to requests.      http://i.imgur.com/GpITUpv.jpg  by /u/celo753           Definately qualifies for the "robot combat" flair    I'm not harping on about official videos  fair enough. Maybe i should have directed it at the OP.  I'm just a bit wary of a sentiment I see emerging on here that the nature of the source is important.  People have virtually stopped sharing current video clips in recent weeks and I blame it on a mild jerk about sticking to the official stuff.   I just said that I don't think it is.  The link here is definitely the official youtube of the battle bot creators.   You can see it link from :  http://battlebots.com/  https://www.facebook.com/battlebots  https://www.twitter.com/battlebots  https://www.youtube.com/user/battlebots etc.    Thankfully, the battlebot creators are good enough to make their stuff avialable to all countries.  abc who bought the series do their own marketing and have their own youtube, twitter etc complementing it.      https://www.youtube.com/user/ABCNetwork  https://twitter.com/battlebotsabc        The production ideas it is something they will improve on for another season.     https://www.reddit.com/r/battlebots/comments/3ax944/contacted_battlebots_was_not_disappointed/  I see the whole "reactions" thing is an attempt at emulating shows like x-factor and america's got talent.  It reminds me of canned laughter from 1980's comedies.     I think it is a rehash of quotes from elsewhere and not an actual new interview ?   It would never happen except for where they could close betting before filming took place.  Getting a betting company involved as a sponsor might be cool for a robotwars reboot outside the US.     No idea. One thing I understand is that he is an american role playing and I believe it is filmed in the US.  Makes it more weird because there must be some kind of regulations around some of the stuff he does.  .. that drone is an example..    Who is watching battlebots ?  ^(shameless plug /r/battlebots)   meanwhile in russia   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SNPJMk2fgJU  (drone+automatic weapon)   They look like filler clips that got cut from the show rather than standalone youtube features.     Your links aren't internationally accessible nor specific and I don't think those videos are  there .  People harping on about official videos will destroy the discussion on this small subreddit.  This subreddit does a lot of good for creating the hype that encourages people to watch the show live when they can.  It really doesn't matter what the source of the clips are.  As you can tell, I am more bothered about content contributors being hounded  or worrying too much about their sources.  For what its worth,   the OP here has posted links to the official youtube channel of the battlebots creators .      The prototype looks all wrong with 4 small jets on each tower.   Don't think I believe this kickstarter but interested in the concept as a consumer product.  Remind me of a big version of Philips AMBX which wasn't a success - particularly the fans addon             The sub is absolutely for anything competitive robots and robot combat related.     There are some links to databases and organisations in [the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/battlebots/wiki/ )  If you find something better, please add them as it is user editable.    the link is  a user editable wiki.   So if you are so inclined, you can add it or someone else may.   From variety   And while most of it is meant to be viewable on plain old TVs, it would also feature special scenes that break the frame, allowing viewers equipped with virtual reality (VR) headsets to look around and explore the inside of a spaceship or immerse themselves in an alien firefight. Its a very interesting blend, said Betuel. The otherworldiness of it lends itself to VR.  Sounds like the alternative angles DVD feature.  Could be good for the success of the series which I'm looking forward to      Pretty open to ideas beyond what I mentioned in the OP. I think that it is half the fun for the people creating stuff to have a lot of freedom.    Steak_59 has already done something cool but if you are rustling anything up we can use it at some point if not at the same time.  Thanks for your interest.   Thanks. That snoo is awesome and looks great.  I've dropped it in the sidebar because I wanted to use it immediately.  Later on it should take its proper position in the header and I'll drop a credit to you too when I figure out the redesign.  For the header, I think some kind of crowd/action photo could look good.

Someone else posted it a minute after you.  However, that link is internationally accessible and not restricted by country. So   we will run with that one and remove this one.     /r/battlebots   A subreddit about robot combat and competitive robotics.  We are trying to get away from the TV brand and make our subreddit more about reddit and reddit's community.    So some kind of snoo would be great or even a whole design for our header.   Something that works on a dark background is probably a good idea.  Also it would be nice to have a snoo's as a user flairs.      Any suggestions or help appreciated.        All those other subreddits are independent of this one.  They can offer different content and a different pace. They are all worth subscribing to and contributing to.    (more related subreddit are listed in the sidebar )  I can only speak for what this subreddit is trying to do and offer.  There is a great community here thanks to the momentum of the TV show but the common interest is way beyond a tv show and that is what I have always defined this community around.     Hopefully things like the [current sticky post advertising a "fantasy league"  will attract interest and happen](https://www.reddit.com/r/battlebots/comments/3d7nci/would_anybody_be_interested_in_a_rbattlebots/ ) .  People are still building bots and may share their local experiences in combat or engineering.  There is also the possibility of a reddit community funded bot but not heard from them for a while.  Review old stuff and general discussions.  Other television shows such as BBC Airheads might be of interest as it sounds like it is going to be of a similar flavour to robot wars.  Hopefully enough to keep all the robot combat subs ticking over.  It may be a little quieter though.  Ideas for this subreddit are most welcome especially people willing to implement them.   /r/battlebots is for fans of robot combat and all forms of competitive robotics.  It isn't tied to the television show.  People are already welcome to post whatever they want here whether it is robotwars, drone racing of conceptual ideas/art.    Any suggestions to help make that more obvious are welcome.  I think we will drop the header image soon and more of the branding that ties to the show once it is over (or even sooner if anyone can help make some nice graphics).    Gore/NSFW warnings would be good    They haven't sold the show abroad yet.  Maybe it is too American or maybe the deal with ABC gives them exclusivity for a bit..   It has been downvoted because it is a repost.  Thanks for posting though.   I've removed this link for the same reason I remove "full episode links" -   A playlist doesn't support a specific discussion about robot combat and is just link dumping.  I'm still trying to work out specific and consistent rules.  So please bear with me and try and understand .   Feel free to add the youtube playlist to [the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/battlebots/wiki/).  I will add it to the sidebar along with the other official links.        Internationally accessible https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHjSr1qz3IA     check the info on /r/shadowban   Added a tab.     Thanks for posting.  However, full episodes posted as direct links are not ok because they are unreliable  and don't support a discussion.  You can post them in the comments though .   Edited clips supporting a specific discussion are fine as links.  So I have removed your post for now.     Then don't bother including them because no one actually cares about them and they do not come to /r/battlebots read about them.  I'm not sure what you are trying to achieve here.   Stop dropping big spoilers and then trolling or ignoring people complaining  . It isn't clever or welcome and this is at least the 2nd time you have done this.   People have asked you nicely.  Each time you have not edited your post or used the spoiler markup in the sidebar.  This shouldn't require moderator intervention.       I was pretty annoyed when the Mod deleted my post and wouldn't explain what I should fix but I'm glad I'm getting some positive feedback   [The problem with your previous essay was highlighted as a flair and a comment.](https://www.reddit.com/r/battlebots/comments/3d2kqw/do_you_want_a_season_2_of_battlebots_we_need_to/ct19ayf).  I even quoted the specific sentence that I was not happy with and matched it up to reddit's rules on vote manipulation.    It was sufficient explanation because  in this revision you say, ... "I apparently can't ask you to upvote..." This is an indication that you are  starting to understand basic reddit rules !  I'm not sure why you feel entitled to any extra attention nor the need to dedicate your revision to me.         Most people think it is a good post.  However, a descriptive title might help avoid surprising people .   Putting the spoiler tag on it seems to damage it as people might think it is more than what it is and avoid it.   How to handle spoilers and people complaining about spoilers is something this sub needs to think about a bit more.  Maybe if there is a 2nd season there will be a firm policy.    I do like that the show has been on the front page of reddit a couple times now but maybe we should agree and try as a subreddit to get proper links voted up on those subs vs illegitimate links.  Reddit rules : **"Don't ask for votes or engage in vote manipulation."**  Also do not encourage negative attention on the people who contribute to this subreddit.    Use /r/battlebotsmeta if you want to address moderation issues in this subreddit  such as what posts should be removed or changed.   Arguably it isn't really a spoiler.  It is just a teaser and has been put out there by Battlebots.  It is the same as any other episode preview or trailer.  This sub discusses public information around battlebots.  The real spoilers that we would probably remove rather than flair is inside information about the results of matches.  Another way to handle this is to just get rid of the spoiler flair altogether because it seems to imply that certain content is off limit when in fact it is on-topic.    I'd rather just encourage descriptive title such as "Episode 5 sneak peek" and even just use the flairs to add this information..   Just to note, we have started to sticky ["spoiler-free" discussion threads for episodes](http://redd.it/3cewrv ) for those that want to avoid teasers and previews.  We also flair things as "robot combat", "bot building" and "general robotics" where the topic isn't battlebots the tv  show.  These are also good for people that want to avoid teasers and previews.      We've made the spoiler tag a bit more substantial. Hope that helps.     To address your specific issue, I have changed the existing "spoiler" flair  to block thumbnails as well as label posts.     nsfw is a bit of a hack and hides too much content from casual users and people don't necessarily want to enable NSFW  on their reddit accounts to view battlebots tv gossip.  Only in very small tight knit communities would it work nicely.  I've removed your post because I don't want people marking stuff nsfw based on your suggestion.    They are using a create-online and sell generic website widget for hats and clothing.  The fact that they have not sold the licensing rights to a proper merchandising company makes me think it is unlikely we are going to see anything quality in the near future.  Next season maybe  More discussion on this  https://www.reddit.com/r/battlebots/comments/3cfpke/battlebotscom_now_selling_merch/   /u/Jamesterjim -  the top mod of /r/robotwars told me he has the original hyponodisc in his garage.  (don't try and figure out who he is or post personal information. I'm just username mentioning him here in case he wants to say hi but he is pretty inactive on that account.)  You are right that it was the most iconic robotwars bot.  It was definitely a collectors item if the original team did not hang onto it.      Interesting to see the branding develop.  They dropped the "RE" bit completely.  RE was an HTC product line.  Still there on the older website logo which was around when this subreddit was made http://www.htcvr.com/   Sure support the official youtube channel.  Maybe we will put that channel in the sidebar along with hulu and abc go.   However, ABC need to make their clips available internationally and not restricted by country.  There may be licensing reason not to do that ..e.g they want to sell the show in other countries.  However,  if it remains as it is , then the fan-made edits become the go-to option for discussion forums and finding them becomes a main topic for discussion.  I think the hype and interest we have on reddit encourages more people to watch the show live and so it isn't doing harm.           /r/robotcombatart  (link)   So you know, that link shortener will hit the spam filter and it will be up to mods to approve it.  So there may be delay    You still got 3000 subscribers here and your /r/Battlebots post seem to get in and ahead of others.  So you have a fanbase and following on reddit no matter what happens on youtube.  If you don't personally want to continue, can I suggest you open up this sub in some way.      "This channel has no videos."  The problem with them closing down all the youtube links is that people are going to be trying harder to find them as it is no long as so easy.  Hence this sub may unfortunately turn into a hive of piracy and not be about all the other cool stuff we talk about.      Some of the short clips of just the battles posted to this sub are still there and working    check the info on /r/ShadowBan as your user account has problems   I don't normally remove posts based on content.

Looks like one of those  generic  T-shirt printing companies that supply a widget for your website when you supply them a logo.    I think they  could do really well on merchandise and licensing .  Toys, clothing etc.   So disappointed to see them promote their brand in such an amateur way.   Hey kidkaracho thanks for posting. I've removed this post as I don't want full episodes posted as direct link posts at the moment . Clips and edited footage that promotes a discussion is fine. Full episode links are tolerated in the comments.  This policy is due to the reliability of links, the need to promote discussion and community wishes.  Sorry, I haven't formulated explicit sidebar rules on this.   This thread is a good slow burner.  Thanks for making it. I've stickied  it and hopefully it will keep going for a bit.    Also don't forget we host "Ask a builder Anything | AMA" threads - normally on wednesdays.  See sidebar.  This week we have Will Bales - "Hypershock"    check the info on /r/shadowban   Already had "fights only" posted .  Thanks anyway   If you want, why not create a  thread for pre-episode [spoiler free] discussion of the fights and predictions .  I'm sure people will respect it and you can make your own rules in the OP for the discussion.  In fact, if you or someone wants to organise and police it properly, I can give them some moderator permissions and it can be a sticky at some point.  As you say, the show is putting the information out there and things like  promos are always going to be dissected in the comments.  I think it is easy to avoid direct discussion of the show and still find plenty of stuff here.    The only stuff I would moderate against is things like the results of matches being revealed by people who have been to the filming.  Now what annoyed me most recently was Terminator Genysis -  every big plot twist was revealed in its [trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNU_jrPxs-0)   In the UK it was called  Scrapheap Challenge.  It was presented by Robert Llewellyn (Kryten of Red Dwarf - Same show that the robotwars presenter Craig Charles is famed for.)  It would be neat if they copresented on a robotwars revival.     Post this to /r/BattleBots      Hey Linhnt thanks for posting. I've removed this post as I don't want Full episodes posted as direct links at the moment .

This isn't about the quality or accuracy of the OP but maybe some casuals have similar thoughts .      Stickied for an hour for the discussion.          Thanks that is a great example of how to do it right.    I think I may discard the bot and try and find a mod to handle it.     The disaster and community involvement in the design is part of the fun.  I guess some dogecoin fans just want to see the branding   I think you are right.  I think people on reddit just want more technical and tactical filler and not just what we are getting now.  I think browsing /r/battlebots while watching the show is the perfect compromise.           Flaired as a possible spoiler.       You know they actually do stuff like this and they millions of views.  Granted, it is "best of" or "top auditions"  rather than episodes.  However, the idea remains that people don't give a shit about the filler especially when viewing for a 2nd time.    The critisim of filler was a big topic here : ["Lets cut to the chase: There was 10ish minutes of watchable TV in the first episode."]( http://www.reddit.com/r/battlebots/comments/3at8pz/lets_cut_to_the_chase_there_was_10ish_minutes_of/)  Below is what battlebots executive produce said to a subscriber of /r/battlebots regarding fillers  [It is the /r/battlebots top post of all time](https://www.reddit.com/r/battlebots/comments/3ax944/contacted_battlebots_was_not_disappointed/)      HI Sepheroth998 - This is Greg the co-founder of BB and EP of the show. Ive been browsing this Subreddit (and all the comments elsewhere on social media. Ive also forwarded the link to the other EPswere listening.    There are many answers to the many comments on the thread, but the bottom line is this:  Were on ABC.     The show many hardcore fans seem to want would never be on ABC. It would more likely be on something like Discovery Scienceand a small cable network would never have the budget to produce the show we want. Because were on ABC we cant make a predominantly science / tech / engineering focused show. We would lose a huge chunk of the audience and never get a season 2.     We have to appeal to a wider range of people, hence the sports casters, tale of the tape, background packages, etc. Wall-2-wall robot fighting and would fatigue a majority of the audience and the show would fail. So we need to walk the line between fights and filler.     Do we have too much filler? I definitely think so. Im actually agreeing with many of the comments Im seeing. But Im a tech/robot geek (probably like most of the Reddit posters). And we cant make the show just for people like us, we need to go broader. In the end its all about balance.    That said, more tech and real robot analysis is coming. Bobak Ferdowsi is a real robot engineer and he will be doing breakdowns of many of the robots in future episodes. And were learningmore importantly our production partner Whalerock is learning, and season 2 will most likely incorporate many of the suggestions were reading from fans, and the balance will be a better mix of fights and relevant talk.     So please stick with us and keep the faith. At worst use the fast forward button on your DVR : ) (or better yet just Mute and get a snack)    And we did try and get Grant on the showjust didnt work out this time around.    Email me anytime  Greg          Put it in the wiki https://www.reddit.com/r/battlebots/wiki/  reddit is spam filtering that domain name.    I would approve it if it wasn't just the homepage.    Airheads coming soon  http://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/mar/12/drones-jeremy-clarkson-airheads-top-gear-bbc-robot-wars  Hopefully it will be a topic in this sub as I think there is enough cross over interest.   /r/battlebots or are you talking about the removal of filler.  because that is a great idea   The battlebots executive producer agrees there is too much filler     The show many hardcore fans seem to want would never be on ABC. It would more likely be on something like Discovery Scienceand a small cable network would never have the budget to produce the show we want. Because were on ABC we cant make a predominantly science / tech / engineering focused show. We would lose a huge chunk of the audience and never get a season 2.  https://www.reddit.com/r/battlebots/comments/3ax944/contacted_battlebots_was_not_disappointed/   Anyway, please subscribe to **/r/Battlebots** .    We have an awesome and lively community during screenings      A lot of subreddits have twitter feeds pumping out links from the new queue.    I made one for /r/Battlebots . https://twitter.com/RBattlebots   I want it to grab some of the audience who follow  #battlebots      However, it was quickly banned from appearing in search results.  That seems fair because it was just spamming links.    So I want to know how did other subreddits get their spamming twitter accounts into good standing with Twitter.  I don't know much about twitter.    Should I be asking my reddit subscribers to interact with it?  Should I give the new account some time to overcome age limitations ?  Should I stop posting links and just post the titles ?  Is my account banned requiring a new account?   So the questions are mainly about how to use twitter to spam reddit links .   I think there are some general lessons and warnings here for setting up a twitter feed .  Any help apprecaited.    original discussion of funding a bot [started on here](https://www.reddit.com/r/battlebots/comments/3bl91f/could_reddit_fundbuild_a_bot/)      Season 1 rules.  https://www.reddit.com/r/battlebots/comments/3bk1sx/season_1_rules/?ref=search_posts    Lots of really good comments there too.    https://www.change.org/p/bbc-bring-back-robot-wars?just_created=true   If only they would all subscribe button to this subreddit!     I thought something like this was a great idea.  It is very reddit too! It gets harder when I think of how much merchandise and stuff is floating around for stuff like RW and not sure of the quality.  It might be a more exclusive thing for the collectors.   Make it more than just an advert.  Tell us more about what you plan to spend the money on and how you may scale up or down depending on what you raise.  Remember there are technical minded people here who can evaluate your plans and there may other  help or interest other than just cash.      " Use Voat Instead "   **The wiki**     I think the [/r/Battlebots wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/battlebots/wiki/index)  could be a useful place to promote other websites, robot combat organisations and guides etc  https://www.reddit.com/r/battlebots/wiki/index   Use it in whatever way you want.   Add pages and improve the formatting if it helps.   Your account needs to have had a small amount of activity in this subreddit to edit it.  If someone wants to put a lot of work into it and curate it, I'll throw them some mod powers to help them manage it.    Meanwhile, I want to try and make sure that our sidebar is promoting community content.   ---------------- **Other stuff**  *User Flairs:*    User flairs are now editable text and can be whatever you want for fun.     People can get a "Verified Roboteer" flair by choosing a flair with the name of their bot or team experience and then participating in the [thread](http://redd.it/39s4hy).  Again, it is just for fun and to identify who is actually a builder of a particular robot .  "Verified Roboteers "  need to remember not to edit the text of your flair or else you will lose your verification status.    *Posting:*  I just wanted to remind people that we are interested in everything around competitive robots and not just Battlebots the television show.  So feel free to share some crazy Ideas, concept art and stuff from other robotic events and tv shows.        /r/battlebotsmeta  exists for ideas, feedback and whatever .     Looks like you started this thread to preach an ideology   Outside the US, there are no options.  Our sidebar has some official US links.  Full episodes are easy to find on youtube. So it doesn't look like they are clamping down on it.  I'd say that it is in their interests to get people widely interested in the brand again in the 1st season.    Example  https://www.reddit.com/r/battlebots/comments/3bgqcd/mohawk_robot_team_member_here_ama/   -----------------  Only Mods can add this type of flair in the flair setting menu   https://www.reddit.com/r/battlebots/about/flair/  Mods need to add  "VER" as the CSS class and then save.   This adds the text "Verified Roboteer" and the yellow background.   --------------- Possible discussion:   Is the styling right?   Who gets flairs?   Do we need any other types of flair?    I don't want it to be untidy and I want people to feel equal unless they have some genuinely useful experience/achievement that a flair may help advertise.  I can do some fancy hovering or animation but then I thought it is better to show the information.   It might be cool to have a selection of grey flairs that users can choose from for fun.  But I'm not bothered to do that work at the moment..  ------------------ Edit: I don't think the old flair templates were set up quite right.  I cleared all the flair templates.  It wasn't a thought out decision, so sorry to whoever took the time to do that and if it was that way for good reason that I did not understand.  Anyway....  It is now user editable text rather than a limited range of flairs.    Those who change their text to their own bot can then get verified by mods.    The old system was too dull and people were choosing flairs like "Robot Wars".  I think it is more fun to let people choose their own text in flairs.        no need.  Just saying so people know if comments or the post itself  disappear.  I already picked this out of the spam bin once .The best thing is not to use the shorteners and revert to long links.     Hey thanks for this.  Just to warn you those links shorteners like goo.gl and others get filtered by reddit . So if you edit the OP or someone quotes them, mods will have to approve them manually.   wrong sub! you want /r/battlebots        Pretty much everyone is saying that.  I hope they see the interest and make a companion show for any subsequent series.   I could also imagine a good youtuber remixing the actual fights with their own analysis and making a better show.      I agree. I changed it yesterday in an effort to make some of the main listing pages easier to read but over looked the main text.    Will have a look   Glad you found the episode discussio thread. removing this   wrong sub.   I'm surprised there hasn't been more fan art and casual discussion of concepts. Maybe this is an interest that will grow more when the show is off air and there is less real stuff to occupt people.  I'm not sure how it would work on a message board but sort of see how it works on reddit. Maybe you can try testing interest sometime.   Hey /r/television, given the popularity of some [recent posts in here](https://www.reddit.com/r/television/comments/2v0gz8/battlebots_coming_back_to_air_on_abc_for_the/), I think there is a lot of interest in the current series of Battlebots.

Part of this means that the door is left open for people willing to step up and make things happen.  Are you offering to do something specific and useful ?  What is your plan for "some energetic positive moderation"?   The other question is, does your plan actually require moderator powers or mod support.    All the mods so far were added by me for a reason  and they have done a lot of good for the subreddit both in hard work, giving it credibility and offering experience.  No one is holding this subreddit back and we are all keen to make as many ideas and activities happen.   We also need "positive community" as opposed to an "entitled community" .     Big Spoilers  For me spoilers are things like who wins and loses matches . If I see such information in the title of a post before a TV show I will remove it and maybe ask the user to repost it with a better title. If I see a title of a post warning of spoilers inside, I may tolerate it depending if the information is important and more than just spoiling the tv show for others.   Mild Spoilers   Mild spoilers are things like photos of bots, tv adverts and who is participating. If the title of a post reflects the content, then there is nothing for moderators to do. If a post title invites people to look at photos, adverts or match line-ups, then a user can to decide for themselves if they want to look at it. They don't need any extra warnings as it is obvious that it is a mild spoiler of sorts. If people are so adverse to mild spoilers and incapable of reading titles, then they should not be browsing a subreddit about battlebots.     I usually add moderators on the basis that they offer to do something useful and specific  This sub is a good place to present ideas.   Other moderators can add new moderators on a similar basis.     Lets make these happen and promote them when they happen.  /r/IAMA allow people to post links to ama events happening in different subreddits.  /r/technology  allow self posts and are often quite tolerant especially if asked nicely.  Other robotic subs?       These have been well done and encouraged some good interactions.   However, I think they can be technically improved by assigning CSS classes. within the flair menu.  With the right styling  "verified roboteers" or teams can have colored flairs or icons.    I can do the CSS for this but if we want to have some icons and graphics, then some help and ideas.     I could add a  flair specific mod in the same way other subreddits do ?   ----  There is also an argument to keep the flairs similar and dull as this encourages an atmosphere where there are no "power users" .        At the moment we allow anything related to competitive robotics.  We aren't removing anything and accept all behavior.  I don't think a tv show is going to bring out the worst in people but who knows.   I think the community is really good and mature.  The downvotes will sort out the really bad trolls.   If anything is removed (comment or link), we inform the user unless it is obvious and random spam.     Some of those repetitive questions such as where to find episodes can be removed if we catch them early and can redirect to an older thread.     This is a widget for promoting threads which may be old or are link threads that we cannot sticky .  Also for making announcements.    [This was the example](http://i.imgur.com/4PNxBcK.jpg).  If it is useful , we could make the header area bigger to accommodate multiple announcements   ----   Moderators simply need to edit the sidebar text to change these  https://www.reddit.com/r/battlebots/about/edit/   Add this to the **top** of the sidebar:      * [](#notice)[Thing 1](link-to-thing-one)     * [](#important)[Thing 2](link-to-thing-two)   ----------   The css code for this change          .side .titlebox .md ul:first-of-type li a[href="#notice"] + a:before {         content:"NOTICE";         background-color:#A0C55F     }           .side .titlebox .md ul:first-of-type li a[href="#important"] + a:before {         content:"IMPORTANT";         background-color:#f44336     }          .side .titlebox .md ul:first-of-type li a[href="#highlight"] + a:before {         content:"DON'T MISS";         background-color:#f44336     }                .side .titlebox .md ul:first-of-type li a[href="#discuss"] + a:before {         content:"DISCUSS";         background-color:#f44336     }    Thanks to RenegadeAI   https://www.reddit.com/r/naut/comments/3ap3vw/how_do_i_make_announcement_bar_like_rplayark/cshtyf3   We don't promote full episode links in any official capacity . There are a lot of people who cannot access the show as it is only broadcast in america and there is literally no other way to access it. Hence, we tolerate it. The sub also tolerates other long clips of the show because people want to talk about them. You are right that it can be a problem as piracy can strangle a show. So this policy may change if the sub grows very large, if we get targeted by spammers, if the community demand the mods take action (as you are now), if battlebots talks to us and explain that it is actually a problem or I start to see DMCA takedown requests in /r/chillingeffects . Right now, we are trying to grow the community and see what they want. So no heavy moderation or rules just yet but rather encouraging people to talk and share stuff. This and other possible rules is definitely something that we should keep talking about though. Meanwhile, feel free to point out the problem to the people sharing links either directly or by addressing the community in a self post.  --------------  Our sidebar now caries links to official episodes (US only) .  This is to show that we do primarily support people using the official methods to access the show.   /r/BattleBots   hjkgjhk   hjkgjhk   kjhk   ,nm,  	141
       I think it's pretty interesting that the article mentions that the leader of the American Federation of Teachers actually sits on the board of a pro-Clinton Super PAC and then proceeded to have the entire union give Hillary its endorsement. Sounds like a favor that was waiting to be repaid.       6'4 fella here. I pulled 315x3 yesterday (pr). It always feels like an eternity passes before that bar gets to the top...   I do have the phone, but the screen is broken so no luck there. Would any other Blackberry do?   Hey guys, I have a memory card with all my pictures on it from when I used to have a Blackberry (iPhone 5s now, please don't burn me), but I don't know how to view these old pictures when I upload the files to my PC. I've got about two years worth of pictures on there that I would like to finally see. Does anyone out there have a solution or are these files just stuck in encrypted limbo forever? Thanks so much for your help.    Well today's our anniversary so we're re-creating our first date and having a picnic in the big park in our city. After we eat, we're reading love letters that we wrote each other for the occasion (her idea, but it works nicely). I'll make sure she reads hers first and the I'll read mine. I've got a nice cheesy line at the end of it that makes a nice transition to me getting down on one knee. I know she's going to say yes, but I can't shake these nerves.   	8
 I grew up in the middle of nowhere. Nowhere as in nothing but woods and dirt roads for miles. The closest store is a gas station a mile away, and all your neighbors, sparse as they are, tend to keep to themselves. My dad worked freelance construction and my mom worked with MRIs at the closest hospital (which was about an hour drive from home). He got a deal with our one 'next door' neighbor. He bought a 200 year old barn from him and using his construction skills, completely renovated it into a house. It wasn't by any means the best locale for their areas of work, but it was a home, and it was ours. Seeing that my parents both worked far from home on a pretty regular basis, I was always stuck with a babysitter. Most of the time it was my grandma, who I call Nana, but this particular week I was being watched by my grandfather.  Now, before I go any further let me say this. My grandfather was a good person in general, but growing up and learning later, he was very abusive to my dad and his two brothers, as well as Dad's mom. My dad was against me staying with my grandfather, and for good reason, but Nana was busy that day and there was no one else who really could on short notice. He was staying at my Aunt Marilou's house (whom I've never met, she died before my mom was even born). This house has been abandoned for years, and was about as old as the barn my dad had converted for us to live in. It has stayed in the family, and since it was only a half mile from our house, my dad kept up the maintenance. My grandpa didn't have a place to stay, so dad offered him the house for the week he was visiting from Tybee Island (GA).   Mom dropped me off at the house with him around 4am. Being a little kid, the only thing on my mind at that time of morning was to go right back to sleep. I woke up sometime around 5 or 6am to a thud. I looked around and didn't see my grandpa so I tossed the blankets over my head and tried to go back to sleep. I heard a muffled sound that shot my eyes wide open. It sounded like talking.  "Grandpa? Grandpa where are you?" I asked. I didn't get an answer so I sat up and decided to go look for him. From where I was in the bedroom, I could walk either into the living room or the dining room. I decided to check the living room first. Now, knowing the cliche' of all old houses having rickety wood floors and creepy paintings on the wall, this house fit it to a perfect capital 'T'. I hated walking through the living room, more because it was a long rectangular shape, more like a long widened hallway and less like a room. I always felt like the pictures on the wall were watching me everywhere I went. As I passed by the piano, I thought I heard a few notes play. Being a somewhat rational little girl I told myself I was just hearing things and continued to the door closest to the front door, which was the other bedroom. The muffled talking sound seemed like it was everywhere now. I didn't know who or what was there, but I was really on edge at this point. I shoved open the door to the other bedroom. Silence. It was so sudden my ears started ringing. I looked around only to find an empty bedroom with the covers still made. I closed the door and walked past the piano again, to the other room on this side of the house. I had never been or even seen inside this room, even to this day. As far as I have been told, it was only used for storage, and mainly for more creepy 'look at you everywhere you go' paintings. No shock, this door refused to open. After a couple of minutes of trying, I gave up. He wasn't going to be in that room. I wandered through the dining room and into the kitchen. No grandpa. Why was I not surprised? What I did find, however, was quite an oddity.   The old 60's style fridge was there with the door wide open. In the light cast from the fridge I could see all the chairs around the kitchen table were slid out, as if awaiting a crowd to sit down. I closed the fridge and put all the chairs back in place. Now this is where it gets really weird. I decided to go lay back down since I had no idea where my grandpa went.   I woke up again to the sound of muffled talking. I opened my eyes to see four white figures standing over me. Three of them were men and one was a woman. I can't remember the details of their faces, but it was scary enough as it was. I threw the covers back over my head and screamed for my grandpa. The talking stopped and I didn't see any glow through the covers anymore. I carefully eased the blankets from my face. Everything looked as normal as can be. I was still a little shaken, but I knew my grandpa had to be somewhere on the property because he was an adult. No adult in their right mind would leave a kid right? I decided to grab something to drink from the kitchen before I took a stroll outside to see where he'd gotten off to. I guess by this time it was somewhere between 7 or 8am.   As I walked into the kitchen, I began to get a sense of deja vu. The fridge was open, yet AGAIN and the chairs were slid out around the table still waiting for someone to sit down. I just shook my head and chalked it up to me dreaming that I put everything away, and did so again. I took one chair and slid it to the counter so I could reach the cabinet for the cups. I grabbed a glass and sat on the counter to drink some water straight from the faucet. I sat it down on the counter and climbed down, sliding the chair back where it was meant to go. I heard a grinding sound behind me. I turned to see my glass had slid about 4 inches from where I had sat it before I climbed down. This spooked me about as bad as the figures I saw so I decided to quickly make my way outside. Just as I was heading out of the kitchen, I felt a splash all over my face and right shoulder as I heard the sound of glass shattering. I glanced down just long enough to see the bottom half of the glass rocking back and forth on its side.   Needless to say, I booked it out of there. I ran right out the side door (which was in the bedroom I was using) and across the yard to the dirt road. I ran as long as I could, and walked the rest of the way back to my house. I have no idea how long that actually took. I remember vaguely stumbling up the cement steps onto the porch and banging on the door until my dad opened it.   "What's a matter? Where's your grandpa?" He picked me up and brought me inside. All I could manage to say to him was "I couldn't find grandpa and I got scared." He called in to work to tell them he couldn't find a babysitter and stayed home with me all day. When mom got home he explained to her what happened (about me running home by myself) and decided to leave to go find my grandpa. They were both furious. Where was my grandfather? He decided to drive up to the store to buy beer as soon as they opened since I was still asleep. He got into a long conversation with some of the locals and lost track of time. From that point on, I refused to go there without either of my parents. If it was still standing today I'm not even sure I'd step foot inside.     ahhh you've got me hooked! I'm so ready to find out what happens!    Awesome story OP! Being a resident of Northeast GA I have spent most my life traveling back roads. This is gonna have me paranoid even more now, especially since my nephew had a similar encounter just last night! No scratches on the car luckily   sounds like you smoked a bad batch, my friend. Sober up for about a month and see how that goes   Definitely interesting. I've heard music with no apparent source before, but it wasn't at night. It sounds like someone or something is making sure you have a good night's sleep! :)   Umbrella corps at it again!   oh god, I HATE clowns. At least you 'got it' OP! I would probably do the same to any clown that chased me tbh. Those things are so freaky!   	7
 The district  as well as the Johnson City Press  received an anonymous email Tuesday morning claiming that a group of players held the younger boys to the ground and rubbed their bare penises on their faces at a Fellowship of Christian Athletes football camp this month at Tennessee Technological University.       Or... Bow to the shoe, cat!      Tiny Houses.  It'll be a hipster thing.   Franklin?   I love Jimmy Fallon.   I hope his name is Yoda.   At first glance I thought this baby was in a blender.  Then I was reminded of dead baby jokes...   I'm not too sure. You'll have to ask him.   I couldn't imagine that. Drowning in the ocean would definitely be the worst.   	11
 loved the hyperloop reference :D     if you can watch in 360p or some lower quality to minimize the cpu spike.      post the output for this - " lspci |grep -i VGA "     ah yes! H2O   its morbidly beautiful! Go till the end!     i have too :D XD      oleophobic - this is for anti-oils  Edit - look below    you have the right settings for YouTube.    Have you tried it in safe mode?   Also check out /u/caspy7 comment.     i finished it! :D   Some stages are real hard though :/   Really tests your brain/logic     Limbo   A flashing system will come later. :)    suit yourself   https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/html5-video-everywhere/   not sure if its just me but Smooth Scroll+APZ enabled on nightly causes a lot blur. Kind of disorienting if you scroll fast enough.     Open hardware at the end slide. That is truly something.     its already present [b2gdroid](https://people.mozilla.org/~fdesre/b2gdroid/)    I just wish it improves much faster and takes off well!   Some unknown good vibe about this one!     Did you try out [Safe Mode](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/troubleshoot-firefox-issues-using-safe-mode) and see if the problems resolved?    If not, [Refresh Firefox](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/refresh-firefox-reset-add-ons-and-settings) or Create a [New Profile](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/profile-manager-create-and-remove-firefox-profiles)(back up data)   https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ideashower.readitlater.pro hl=en  http://www.apkmirror.com/apk/read-it-later/   i meant the general policy of limiting rooting by manufacturers; not some app/developer.    Only limited to India.    Indian users should demand rooting as a legal modification of one's device.    Phones in Europe are under warranty even after being rooted.    Facebook asks me to go install flash... I went and installed an addon to get html5 videos, everything is good! :)    If u really need flash, uninstall via the Uninstaller provided at the Adobe site and then install a fresh version.   See if the problems still exist.   Youtube- whats enabled on youtube.com/html5 ?  What OS and FF version?   check this add-on - HTML5 Video Everywhere!   Works good!    EDIT- doesn't work in theater/pop-up mode. have to open video in new tab   apparently the "HTML5 Video Everywhere!" add-on does the job very well  EDIT- doesn't work in theater/pop-up mode. have to open video in new tab   Maybe it's a slow rollout   Yup!    have no flash installed on linux. Still serves me flash.   probably have a policy not to let things that break their offering, so as to be in control of their download store.   also the nova prime version can also be side-loaded; there will be a trade off somewhere in this kind of approach     as per nova; it could be a play-store kinda stuff where they have control.    As an open app you see the potential is unlimited     Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/43.0.2357.132 Safari/537.36      Youll may have to modify this for your OS; or check UA from chrome; copy-paste ;)     Yes! but you need to be on the latest chrome 43 user-agent.   The player has minor defects though     More transition effects in the app drawer or homescreen switches.   More app based integration like aviate.   my color screen like themes.   ^ all of this added/removed by the users wishes(so he/she can keep it light or as feature rich as possible).    Im not Saying Nova devs should'nt be rewards for their work. They have every right to put a price on their app after all the hard-work that goes into it.    But the possibility of the what nova can do can be really expanded once you have a user/dev/contributor system in place.    Also people will pay for stuff if they feel that it improves the overall experience on android.  If an opportunity arrives that they can invest on it/choose the set best set of features for the next version; many will definitely contribute to the development.        True, but one with free cost and run by donation/user input will be nice; i've linked the example of krita and its a solid mode of development - https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/krita/krita-free-paint-app-lets-make-it-faster-than-phot   they do play html5 on chrome :/   its really really annoying!      plugin API  ah yeah thats the right word, my bad.    But going completely open and having a development model like [Krita](https://krita.org/)([kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/krita/krita-free-paint-app-lets-make-it-faster-than-phot) based for funding for new features+open-source) is  truly spectacular.   Yes i do know its free, but there are better features on the paid version.   If we have an open system, people have access to all of this and if they really like it you could donate to fund development.    Sadly google rewards isnt everywhere.   yup an open-source alternative :)   i've personally noticed that lot of people want to customize but don't really do anything because they look up their favorite launcher has a limited custom set of awesome features; and also for lots of android user - the cost is a big hindrance($ - local currency conversion)    So most of them settle for the UI that comes with the phone or install a free version of the launcher with limited set of feature.    When you have an open environment, users/devs could write an unlimited amount tiny plugins that people can download for features they'd like to have in a launcher.    The app can also accept donations from users so that good development happens.    I really like Nova and i hope they continue to be the game changer! :)    i didnt mean for them to cease development; i just wish it'll bring in more addition from people who could write plugins for new UI experiences.   Additionally it can be free of cost for people to find it hard to pay the price.    Onside note - Yes the do deserve to keep it on sale! They're are doing a great job! :D       we need an open-source alternative to nova.   hell nova should do this!    Edit - i guess i didnt explain my thoughts in the best way possible; probably the sub threads will help bring it to light   THIS THIS AND ONLY THIS!   Install    Use gnome-tweak-tool to change the hdpi settings,     Also have the graphics driver installed.    If it's a Optimus technology based graphics technology, install bumblebee. Fedora has an article on bumblebee and steps for it.   Else grab the driver for nvidia from rpm fusion.    Yeah that's why I heard. I bought limbo on sale before.  I loved the game even though it was short and a single time    Never go full retard   nope :(   i think ill get that    Monument Valley and Wolfram Alpha.   one time thing wont play/use constantly so waiting for a discount.     i hate that 'a' icon. it looks out of place.    i just want to say this.    Don't give up on the b2gdroid platform.   it has a HUGE HUGE potential im totally unaware of but i know it exists.   Yes, its not bug-free but please continue to develop and erase all the issues.    I was instally in awe of the UI on b2gdroid; and its very very good on usability and friendliness.    Keep developing!    Once its ready launch it on the playstore as an homescreen alternative and take-off from there!    One Major issue- battery drain. Please fix that. And if rolling nightly releases are available things will be much better for tester's.     The b2gdroid implementation was really really good.   Ofcourse there are bugs everywhere. But its a good take off for FirefoxOS on android devices.   I really hope they continue to develop on it.     Oh damn, Phoronix went a retweeting spree   What do you have enabled on www.youtube.com/html5?    :D   this is genius! O_O    it depends on the site. There nothing you can do if they don't serve html5 video content.   If you need to install flash, download the latest and keep it constantly updated.     then it could be mostly your add-ons. Check it out in Safe-mode and see if the issue occurs.   If it still happens and is limited to FF then mostly a bug.    what all enabled on youtube.com/html5 ?   i've reported about this many times via the app and the site; along with various other issue.   No response nor action. Just the standard "Thank you for reporting this issue" :(   its the mobile site.  You should switch to or goto https://www.youtube.com/   Just tell me whats in red on youtube.com/html5   do you have a dual gpu system? nvidia+intel? optimus Tech?     is yours a dual gpu system? Optimus tech? Intel+Nvidia?     if you really need flash use an addon like "youtube html5" that force enables it.    Mostly the "request html5" should switch you over to html5 and make it a permanent change unless cookies or cache gets cleared after every session(which could cause it revert back)    Happy YouTubing! :)   if im not wrong - YouTube is html5 by default now;   Mime Type: video/mp4; codecs="avc1.4d401e"   DASH: yes (134/140)    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLLQK9la6Go   ^ this is an indicator of html5 playback    Why dont you try clearing; cache and cookies related to YouTube and see if has any effect.   I hope you don't have any add-on that has forced flash to play.      if everything like i mentioned in the other comment fails   Get gstreamer1; gstreamer0.10 is End of Life;   And im not sure how debain works around with this stuff.   Buy according to fedora you'll have a good, bad and ugly set of gstreamer packages.( Maybe a separate ffmpeg package too).   Maybe debian has them inbuilt.    http://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/download/    Perhaps you could ask around in r/debian for more help.     okay do one thing - try using an add-on that forces YouTube to use html5.   If that works out then right click to see if you're being served mp4 video formats.   Another option will be to disable flash inside the browser.         sounds like a true revolution on that page!    weird format? could you post a screen shot?   Also what does youtube.com/html5 tell you?   Have you tried clearing cache   cookies for youtube?     check this out too - http://windows.microsoft.com/en-IN/windows/download-windows-media-player   :)   thats quite strange. Do you have chrome, perhaps your could check youtube.com/html5 and see if it helps?   Also on what Firefox version are you on?     http://windows.microsoft.com/en-in/windows/codecs-frequently-asked-questions#codecs-frequently-asked-questions=windows-8   do you have media player installed?   Thats the only source other than KB update file through windows update   you should also have gstreamer0.10 and gstreamer1 packages installed    you should allow access on the android phone after plugging in the device.    Test with a different port or usb cable   Disable Flash? it'll be better i think    Verify in about:config and if these are set to true:    media.mediasource.enabled   media.mediasource.format-reader.mp4   media.mediasource.mp4.enabled   media.format-reader.mp4   media.fragmented-mp4.enabled   media.fragmented-mp4.exposed   media.fragmented-mp4.ffmpeg.enabled   media.fragmented-mp4.gmp.enabled    Set this to false: media.mediasource.webm.enabled    Verify @ youtube.com/html5   webM(under development)   If somethings are missing from the ones listed here its okay     dont enable webM(it still under development) - itll cause playback trouble  goto about:config and set these to true:    media.mediasource.enabled   media.mediasource.format-reader.mp4   media.mediasource.mp4.enabled   media.format-reader.mp4   media.fragmented-mp4.enabled   media.fragmented-mp4.exposed   media.fragmented-mp4.ffmpeg.enabled   media.fragmented-mp4.gmp.enabled    Set this to false: media.mediasource.webm.enabled    Verify @ youtube.com/html5   webM(under development)   If somethings are missing from the ones listed here its okay     dont enable webM(it still under development) - itll cause playback trouble   well if thats the case you might have to contact the add-on dev.   If that seems hard then probably filing a bug with the similar format details of bugs listed on the above site might be fine.   click on report bug should take you to bugzilla. Mostly the add-on dev get contacted from there   i think he meant to report the crash links here   better let it be disabled; you'll run into playback issues. Its still under development   Hey there!    Check on these lines in about:config to be set to "true":    media.mediasource.enabled   media.mediasource.format-reader.mp4   media.mediasource.mp4.enabled   media.format-reader.mp4   media.fragmented-mp4.enabled   media.fragmented-mp4.exposed    Some of the option listed above might not be there in your Firefox so its okay to skip them.   And a suggestion let webM be disabled. You'll run into a lot of choppy performance issues on YouTube and ruin the experience.   Also dont think ignore_codecs is necessary. Try without it as well.    If h264 is still being unrecognized its mostly the codec not being present on the system.     and...still getting downvotes. o.o  Started from the bottom now we here!   goto - Add-ons -  Plugins -activate   Ensure you're on the latest version to protect yourself   Why isn't Firefox users being served html5 just like the Google Chrome Crowd?    people putting up imgur links are the greatest!    its meant for linux; it uses chrome's flash and runs it for firefox   They could have put a better snapdragon.   Maybe for collectors or nostalgia buyers   Use the same circle selection took and trace out the shape. Just paint the edges with paintbrush   Try something like pipelight or fresh flash player and see if it loads.    The Linux flash player is so old that at time new content will never load on it       Support for new Unicode 8.0 skin tone emoji - https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/39.0/releasenotes/   And color does work with Firefox on Android; its been implemented for desktop long back - https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=889401   F11 should do that by default and only show the awesome bar when you mouse over near the top of the screen.   Maybe one of your add-ons is causing interference? Check in safe mode?     http://blog.getemoji.com/post/82224498347/how-to-use-emoji-in-windows-7   https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/2729094     Yeah i do understand your situation. Perhaps you could create a post and explain your situation. Someone could help you out :)   OS?   i think it depends on the OS's capability to render colored one's or not.   On android it does render with color and google's emoji set.   on my linux machine pure black and white :(   what i mentioned here is for personal usage.(i don't want to blamed for some problems on a larger scale later on - hope you understand; and everything can be fixed with a reset/refresh)   Since these things will become enabled in the proper way once things hit release.   But if you insist use this addon for mass setup - https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/cck2wizard/    Not sure how it works but perhaps the right one for the job.   Also:   https://wiki.mozilla.org/Deployment:Deploying_Firefox    Above stuff include parameters for linux   trace out with a path tool and make it a selection-paint brush with a white color   for the inner circle use the circle selection and paint it out blue.   unknown person 1: nearby(visible) unknown person 2: nearby(visible)  Msg 1-2 : Hey!

Things work pretty good on my end without it     Wow! this is neat :D This should become an easter egg inside firefox release ;) :D   update to the latest version of flash provided by adobe.   Personally; id just let it be disabled for sometime until they finish uncovering everything the Hacker Team did.    Popular sites will have an html5 alternative; mostly you'll never need to do anything.     This is so Awesome :D   that video is 360p60 strange O_O   i think its high time sites move away from flash. Hopefully people start voicing their opinions over email or social media and that turns to a positive change.   whoever even thinks of helping them - Just Do IT! Anything is POSSIBLE!   does this happen in safe mode as well?   If it doesnt then probably some add-on is causing the trouble   per element is what ive been looking for a long time. Didn't know it existed    i just love how adobe cancelled linux support with "security updates" only xD   look at comment below  	113
    I don't think it is all that bad, provided you have an absolutely solid grasp of math. You're taking basically three full math courses (four, if you include stats) that they really expect you to take only one of every semester. Each will have long, weekly assignments, multiple tests, probably around the same time, and pretty brutal finals. Add 122 and Thermo on top of that, and you might as well kiss your free time goodbye, unless you really really enjoy math and are exceptionally good at working *quickly* through it.   Also, Mihai is absolute garbage. I have also heard Steif is not good either.  I would recommend spacing out these difficult math classes over the course of more semesters. Knock out a few required electives instead of trying to get through all the gen eds as fast as you can.    Sold 3DS XL to /u/Thromordyn       With or without shipping costs? Where do you need it shipped to?    I've got an Asus r9 270x, complete with box and everything. Offer.    Yes, the locker room, showers, and pool are closed. No towel service either.    The new facilities are reported to be ready and open by the time fall semester starts, but we all know that there are most likely going to be delays. In the meantime, there is Skibo gym, which has a modest collection of weights.   The smaller gym in the CUC is still open on and off during the renovations, you will just need to check since the closings aren't scheduled. Though this gym is mainly equipment and dumbbells, no bench press benches or squat racks, so if you want to do heavy lifting you will want to go to Skibo anyways.        Don't forget to get the Material Design skin!   The marimba sounding notes at the beginning are sharp and sound very dissonant match up with the piano.   At the part beginning at 1:27, the piano just sounds out of tune. Did you record it using a real piano?    Sold 3DS XL to /u/Thromordyn     In competitive smash it's more used for precisely inputting aerial attacks. It's very important in that aspect.    No, they run on their own Nintendo charger   They are both in perfect condition.   SOLD!  Hi everyone!  I have a 3DS XL in Blue/Black for sale. It's in great condition, didn't get it all that long ago. The only damage is two very small chips of paint right under the front cameras, barely noticeable. Everything else is perfect condition. It's still under GameStop warranty (they'll replace any damage no questions asked) until October of this year. I'll include receipt so you can redeem if necessary.   Will come fully reformatted and ready for a new user/system transfer. Will not include a charger. You can grab a USB Charger from Amazon for about $5. Running version 9.5.0-22U  Selling because I got a New 3DS XL.   Thanks for looking!  [Album (sorry for potato quality)](http://imgur.com/a/Snk9v)  [Album with pics of chips and closeup of the back](http://imgur.com/a/5ZQKV)  [Timestamp](http://i.imgur.com/2YyHKcV.jpg)   I got someone for $100 right now so I'll let you know if that doesn't work out.   Honestly $100 is already a pretty good price so I wouldn't go lower than that. I could sell it on eBay for more but that's kind of a hassle with Paypal fees and what-not.    I have the receipt from when he bought it, and that matches the information that he gave me/location that he sent it from. That's what I based it on. I would be shocked if there was another owner before me.   Again, this device is under GameStop warranty for another 8 months. If ANYTHING goes wrong, you can bring it to GameStop and they will replace it for you no questions asked. I will give you the receipt so you can redeem this if needed. The receipt has the serial number which matches that of the device.    Upon closer inspection it looks like there are tiny chips above the two cameras on the front face. It doesn't look bad (I honestly didn't notice anything wrong when I first got it until I inspected it just now). Nothing else is wrong with it.   In truth, I am the second owner. I bought it in a bundle with a few games only a few weeks ago in the intention of selling the console after getting the New 3DS XL.   [Pics of the front dings and a closeup of the back.](http://imgur.com/a/5ZQKV)    Looks like shipping is gonna be way too much for what it's worth. Sorry about that :(   Hmm obviously shipping would have to be higher but I can look into it. Whereabouts in Canada?    What exactly would you like to know?    9.5.0-22U   Hi everyone!  I have a 3DS XL in Blue/Black for sale. It's in ~~absolutely flawless~~ great condition, didn't get it all that long ago. It's still under GameStop warranty (they'll replace any damage no questions asked) until October of this year. I'll include receipt so you can redeem if necessary.   Will come fully reformatted and ready for a new user/system transfer. Will not include a charger. You can grab a USB Charger from Amazon for about $5.   Selling because I got a New 3DS XL.   Thanks for looking!  [Album (sorry for potato quality)](http://imgur.com/a/Snk9v)  Edit: it's running version 9.5.0-22U  Edit2: It looks like there are some small chips right above the camera that I didn't notice until I inspected it closely just now. It doesn't look bad, I didn't even notice them when I first got the console used.   [Album with pics of chips and closeup of the back](http://imgur.com/a/5ZQKV)   It's probably the quality studio lighting he has going on.    I was also kind of hesitant on the MM version but I definitely wanted a New 3DS XL. I heard there was going to be a limited supply of both (obviously much less MM editions) so I went down to Target right before opening to try my luck and get at least one system.   I managed to get a system and my god it is GORGEOUS in person. Pictures really don't do it justice. The gold is dark and understated, and while I usually hate glossy finishes this one looks so damn sophisticated, like the decals are infused with the system. I feel like a matte finish would have made it look sprayed or stenciled on.   If you have even the slightest inkling for keeping it I would highly recommend it.    Got one at the Waterfront Target. They only had three and all were gone right away.    Got an InStock alert. I just ordered one!   *Edit: looks like it shows up on desktop but not on mobile.       Target at Waterfront, Pittsburgh, PA. only had three units. I was able to pick one up! Didn't even wait in line (it's in the single digits in my area so I don't think people wanted to wait outside). No Majora's Mask versions left.   They didn't have any of the new 3DS XLs in the case, though they probably didn't put them out by the time I got there. Worth a shot if you're still looking.    That's not true. The 770s fit right in-between the urban slims and the 484.    Confirmed   Seriously, I want the MM 3DS but I'd be perfectly happy with $50 off the regular system. Best Buy isn't obligated to give you anything, be happy they gave you $50.    PM'd   I host a smash party/tournament at my place every few weeks for my close friends. Usually I just order pizza but I was inspired by [this photo](http://i.imgur.com/v9PVLeI.jpg) to make my own smash-themed snacks. What are some good Smash Bros. themed snacks that you guys can come up with?   Some of my ideas:  * Falcon PUNCH * Jiggly cream puffs * Smash ball pizza   Thank you!   Yes. I just reflash the kernel after each update.   I completely agree with you. It will be acceptable to some, and unacceptable to others. It doesn't offend me, and has never offended me. It's just something that I personally wouldn't do if I didn't have to wear glasses, given my (admittedly pretty strong) personal moral values.   As I have said from the beginning, these are my opinions that I offer as someone who does actually have to wear glasses. I'm not trying to convince you or anyone else to do either way; these are just my thoughts on the matter. Make of them what you will.    Yeah, it's definitely an extreme case that isn't really the best example. I'm just saying that some people might extrapolate to that. Granted, people actually do some really dumb stuff to try to look cool sometimes. I have heard of people breaking their own arms in middle school to get a cast to look cool.   I posted a follow up to my comment that I think really explains my reservation against wearing glasses purely for fashion. Please give that a read and tell me what you think.   Okay here are some follow up thoughts.   The whole point of MFA, in my opinion, is getting clothes that compliment your body shape, style, and personality. We do this because everyone has to wear clothes, and how you look is a big part of how other people perceive you and your personality. To me, the most important part of clothing is being true to yourself and your personality, and not trying to trick people into thinking you are something you aren't. It's like wearing biker gear to try to get a girl who likes bikers to like you. It might work, but then you aren't being true to who you are. And when people find out that you are, in a sense, lying about who you are, they tend to get a little angry.   Sure, glasses might compliment your facial shape, and make you look smarter and more appealing to other people, but it's not necessary for you to wear. As such, it might seem like you are being deceitful and tricking people into thinking you are something you aren't. If you are really smart and nerdy, people will know it without you having to wear nerdy glasses to show that, and you wouldn't have to wear glasses to prove that to people. I wear glasses because I have to wear them, so I might as well pick a pair that both looks good and conveys the style and personality that I am; not to try to be something I'm not.   I will admit, it is a definite gray area. It will offend some people and won't offend others. I definitely think about fashion fairly differently than most people on this sub I think, so my word might not be the best to listen to.   I think it's akin to wearing a cast if your arm isn't broken to look tough, putting an athletic bandage on to make it look like you work out, or talking in an accent to make you appear more worldly. Remember when Bluetooth headsets were a thing? Sure they may have served a purpose, but wearing one when you weren't taking a call (ie. when they weren't necessary) was pretty douchey. In my opinion, the only saving grace is that no one will know. But to those who are slightly knowledgeable about glasses it's pretty easy to tell whether lenses are prescription or not just by looking.   The fact that you want to wear them to look "smarter" or more like a nerd worries me. I feel like it's kind of playing into a stereotype more than anything. Would you go so far as getting a surgery to look more Asian since Asians are stereotypically perceived as smarter? But then again, it's like dressing with well fitting clothes to make you appear thinner or more athletic than you are, so that may be a moot point.   I think if you want to go for it, go for it. I've met a few people with fake glasses, and I haven't really held reservations against them once I found out they were fake.   Full disclosure, though: my vision is bad enough that I need to wear glasses to drive or read the board at school, but I can function completely fine without them. Before I joined MFA, I carried around a pair to use at school, but once I got a pair that were relatively stylish and actually complimented my facial shape, I started wearing them all the time. For me, it was a combination of it both looking nice and being more convenient if it forgot to take them with me somewhere. I guess you could say I am wearing them to look better, but I also get actual utility from having better vision. But then again you might be getting more utility from looking better too. And some people definitely do look much better with the right glasses...   ... Now I really don't know what to think.   Sorry I can't give you a more definitive answer, but there are my thoughts on the matter for you to consider.   ElementalX is working on my Nexus 5 running CM12 nightlies.    Invite up: [GLJQ-CVCE-XYC3-OHNK](https://account.oneplus.net/invite/claim/GLJQ-CVCE-XYC3-OHNK)   Yeah, I definitely won't be going for a phone with a screen size larger than 5 inches from now on, unless it has ridiculously small bezels. From now on I will be looking at the dimensions before I buy to make sure it is not too big.    This review contains only information about my experience with the Oneplus One coming from a Nexus 5. It will not talk about software, as software is so customizable I don't even consider it a factor in the purchase of an Android phone anymore.   Right before the ball dropped for New Year's, the dreaded happened: I dropped my beloved Nexus 5 and shattered the screen. Thankfully, everything still worked, but shards of glass were flaking off and were posing a hazard to my clothing. My Nexus 5 had served me faithfully for over a year, and it seemed like the time had come for it to retire for the next latest-and-greatest.   I had had my eye on the Oneplus One as soon as it had been released, and it was my natural choice for a replacement. I purchased an invite off of eBay (this was before I discovered this subreddit!) and in about a week I had my new Oneplus One.   Now, less than 14 days after shipment, I have decided to return the One. Here's why.   GENERAL REVIEW  **Packaging**  * [Yeah, it's really nice](https://forums.oneplus.net/attachments/11-jpg.11235/). The cardboard is some of the heaviest I have seen on electronics packaging. The inclusion of an additional Nano SIM adapter is a really nice, super thoughtful touch. The USB cable is top quality, and the SIM tray ejector comes in an over-the-top [silicone keychain holder](http://www.gsmdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/OnePlus-One-review_026-660x495.jpg). The [charge block](https://forums.oneplus.net/attachments/us_charger-jpg.163435/) came in it's own, separate box, presumably to account for different outlet standards. It looks good and is well build. Very impressed so far, especially for a $350 device.   **First impressions**  * Wow, this thing is big! I did not expect a 0.5 inch size increase to result in such a drastically bigger phone. My Nexus 5 could [basically fit inside the screen](http://cdn03.androidauthority.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/oneplus-one-vs-nexus-5-aa-25-of-28-710x399.jpg) of the Oneplus One.   * The build quality is fantastic. The silver metal border isn't a super shiny chrome and brings a pretty good amount of class to the device without being too gaudy. The sandstone back didn't feel as great as it was hyped to be but It does feel nice. It's a nice departure from the deep, all black design of the Nexus 5. I would equate the Oneplus One to a [Lamborghini](http://www.caradvice.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Lamborghini-Huracan-2.jpg) and the Nexus 5 to a [stealth bomber](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/dc/US_Air_Force_B-2_Spirit.jpg)  **General Build Complaints**  * The buttons are really flush with the sides of the phone, and don't have very much travel distance when pushed. The volume rocker is small (it could pass as a single button), which makes it hard to find and press which volume button you want in your pocket.   * The power button is closer to the center of the phone than the top. On the Nexus 5 it is almost right at the top. My thumb does not naturally fall on the button when I am gripping my One normally (it lands a little above), like it does when I hold my Nexus. This is not necessarily a bad thing, since it gives you a slightly more secure grip on the phone since you're not afraid of pressing the button accidentally. However, I don't think this was an issue to begin with. I never had that problem when I used my Nexus 5, and the buttons are flush enough and have such a high actuation force the I wouldn't be afraid of pressing the button even if it were right under my thumb.   * The SIM card tray is awful. It is plastic, unlike the machined metal of the Nexus 5 or any other flagship phone now for that matter. The SIM does not sit very securely on the tray (it can wiggle around a little), and made me question whether I was inserting it right on first try. Also, the fact that you can actually insert the SIM incorrectly is an absolutely TERRIBLE design oversight. The sheer number of complaints of people inserting their SIMs upside down is just ridiculous. Always assume your customers are absolutely stupid and make it impossible for them to mess up anything.   * The raised glass on the front makes me never want to place my phone face-down. Ever.   **Comparisons**  * Screen: Yes, it is much bigger. It is by far the most comfortable phone for me to use with two hands. I never have to squint or strain at all to read anything on this screen. The colors are slightly truer and more muted than the Nexus 5, but with software tweaks this is a non-issue. I happened to get one with the dreaded [yellow tint of death](https://forums.oneplus.net/attachments/yellloopo-jpg.78216/) but it does go away after a short-ish amount of time.   * Speed: I flashed both phones to a fresh Cyanogenmod 12 to test this. It definitely feels a slight amount faster than my old Nexus, but my slight I mean SLIGHT. In day to day life I don't think it will really matter. In my two weeks of using the One as a daily driver I never had a "wow, that was fast" moment, and my Nexus was already plenty fast for me. Extreme power users may notice a bigger difference, but for the common man, an upgrade for speed alone is not worth it.   * Vibration: The vibration on the Oneplus One sucks. It's tiny (I can't feel it in my pocket), is loud (makes a racket on my desk), and doesn't feel solid (haptic feedback doesn't feel "right" anymore). I love the solid, slow rumble of the Nexus. The vibration motor is actually very fast and powerful - if you grip it in your hand when it vibrates it actually feels very substantial - however, the weight of the phone makes the phone not vibrate enough when it is loose in the world (on a desk, in a loose pocket, etc.). The result is a loud sound as the motor whirs inside but the phone doesn't actually move all the much. They would have done much better to keep the vibration speed slower to actually rock the phone instead of buzzing.   * Size: I think I have pretty average sized hands, especially when you factor in girl-sized hands. I could just wrap my hands around the Nexus 5 while using my thumb relatively comfortably around the entire screen, and it always felt very secure. The One is absolutely unwieldy to use with one hand. There is no way I can wrap my hand around the phone and use the thumb as well, so I am always cradling the phone in my hand instead of actually gripping it. I was terrified that if anyone bumped into me it would fly out of my hand. Using this thing in New York would be a nightmare.  * Camera: I'm not really a picture guy so I don't think I'm super qualified to talk about this aspect.   * Audio: I listen to a lot of music and consider myself an audiophile. I used a Havi B3 Pro and a Grado SR325e to make this comparison. The One definitely has a flatter sound signature, but has just slightly more power than the Nexus 5. The B3 Pro is relatively difficult to drive, and usually requires around 80% to 100% power to hear reasonably. The One can comfortably play all files at around 60% to 75% power. However, my Nexus 5 on Cyanogenmod 12 got a huge boost in volume, and can now play files at around the same volume level as the one. As for sound quality, I have to give the Nexus 5 the edge. Using my Grados, I could just hear more details over the entire range with better separation and soundstage. The audio jack on the Nexus 5 also feels more solid than that of the One. It seems to me that the audio module in the One was one place where they cut costs to save.   * Battery Life: Yeah, the One wins hands down. I'm a pretty moderate user and usually got through the day with more than 60% to 50% left in the tank. My Nexus 5 usually has around 30% with ElementalX kernel. I'm sure you could go two days on a single charge with the One if you thought just a little about saving power. No way could you do that with the Nexus. With custom kernels I'm sure the battery life will only get better.   WHY I'M RETURNING IT  The size. That's really the only thing that bothers me. The size bothered me for the whole two weeks I was using it. Every time I held it in my hand I was afraid I would drop it. Sitting down meant the phone would dig into my hip - even walking up the stairs I was reminded of the phone in my pocket. I'm always on the go, so I need to use this phone quickly out and about. This phone just wasn't able to give that to me. The only time I really enjoyed using the phone was when i had a few minutes to sit down and browse while waiting for the bus or an appointment - otherwise, the screen size was more of an encumbrance than a benefit. I picked up my broken Nexus 5 after a few days of only using the One and I absolutely loved how it fit into my hand. The benefits of the One just don't make up for having a portable device - which is, after all, what a phone is. To me, the One felt like a tablet with phone functionality than a phone. If the One were a five inch phone with the same dimensions as the Nexus, I would have kept it, no question.   I purchased a replacement screen for my Nexus and will try my hand at repairing it myself.   TL;DR: Got the Oneplus One after I shattered my Nexus 5's screen, loved it, but it was just too big for me to use comfortably on the go. Will be returning it and trying to repair my Nexus 5 myself.    Lay them out to dry and shape them back into their general shape. It's called blocking.   They make [Docker's Alpha Standard Tapered](http://us.dockers.com/family/index.jsp?categoryId=57080986 cp=2271557.34412696 ab=men_LeftNav_collections_DockersAlphaCollection_StandardTapered_08082013).   Not sure how to do it, but the print technique used is most likely transfer printing or vinyl printing, if that helps your search.   They are more commonly called no-show socks, and won't even come up to your ankle.   Return the newly shipped item with the old receipt.    If there are no belt loops I would say do not use a belt. It will get out of place and just look bad.   Additionally the material of the coat and said belt would have to match perfectly for it to look like the belt is meant to be there. Using a cloth belt on a wool coat would look like you just threw the belt on randomly and it will look out of place. I'm going to guess you got a wool overcoat, which means you would need some sort of wool belt. As for color, I think a contrast belt might be cool (black coat, light gray belt) but it absolutely HAS to be the same material.   I'd say either try to find a belt and then post a fit-pic here or just rock it as is.    I used to be super self-conscious about how I looked to everyone when I first started dressing better. I would always check my appearance in every window I passed and would constantly look down to makes sure everything was in place. Eventually you get used to it. Took me about two months to stop thinking about my clothes constantly when I was out.   You look great, dude! Keep at it!    American Eagle has some nice, well fitting ones. On clearance right now.    They are a little less formal than a pea coat or a top coat. Very versatile coat that is much less common than pea coats.   You can't go wrong with [Gloverall](http://www.gloverall.com/), who basically invented the duffle coat.  [Schott](https://www.schottnyc.com/products/satin-lined-duffle-coat.htm?catID=9) also sells some quality duffles. [This](https://www.schottnyc.com/products/short-duffle.htm?catID=9) short option is a nice modern twist on the traditional long coat.   Since it is a little less formal, I would recommend a less formal color, such as a light gray, olive, or camel.    I just recently picked up a pair of Unbranded 201s. We'll see if my opinion changes once they fade.   	53

Then these relationships include political contributions, political approval for military spending, lobbying to support bureaucracies, and oversight of the industry.

Theory off the top of my head, could this be due to some degree of greter levels of galaxy mergings during the first few billion years of our universe while they were closer, and mitigated later due to fluctuations in smoothness and proximity of early galaxies?

The best way to get rid of a leech is to just leave it until it is full. After 10 minutes it will be full, stopped the blood flow, and will leave the body. While it is untrue that ripping off a leech will result in part of it being left behind, the leech uses an anticoagulant to prevent the blood from clotting, so removing the leech will result in the wound not healing quickly and a loss of even more blood. The leech will seal off the wound when finished drinking about a teaspoonful. Burning the leech will make it vomit which may result in other blood it has collected going into your body.

It won't get you shadowbanned.   I think we all see it as a privilege. Sure it's time consuming and thankless for zero pay, but cool crew and we're all tech nuts..it's really quite satisfying!   In /r/technology we will allow it if it fits within the rules of the subreddit. We have removed ones that don't.   As a current mod of /r/technology, I feel I should update our current circumstance. We had a few moderators who had added terms to Automoderator such that posts containing these [terms would be automatically blocked](https://pay.reddit.com/r/undelete/comments/22yewf/i_have_identified_a_list_of_keywords_that_are/). This was obviously scandalous. Those moderators were removed, and a raft of changes drafted to ensure it would not be repeated. Along with open recruiting of a new mod team based on skills and merit, new rules for the sub were proposed, voted upon and adopted by the community. The CSS for Automoderator is available for anyone to check [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/wiki/config/automoderator). Mods can be messaged via the /r/technology sidebar, and yes we do read and respond to them all. Whether we're default or not doesn't particularly faze us, we have a huge community who I'd argue now feel they have greater ownership of it. We only have 27 moderators for 5.146 million subscribers, we rely on them to help us keep it as we would like the technology subreddit to be. Anyway,  we may never outlive how those who came before screwed up, but we're doing ok doing what we do. Hope that helps..   Never get involved in a land war in Asia   ayy Mao!

 The title is a direct quote from the article, which in turns comes from a fairly respectable blog. (By which I mean it doesn't usually post clickbait-y stuff.)   I've said it here before and I'll say it again. The most important piece of advice I got in my Barbri class back in the day was this: the bar exam is a pass/fail exam, and every point you get above passing is wasted time you could have spent with loved ones, reading a good book, or watching a movie.   It's laid-back. Students work hard and play hard, but aren't in competition against other students. I've never heard of someone refusing to help someone, or hiding books, or not sharing notes, etc., the way I've heard horror stories out of some other schools, nor do Dartmouth students try to one-up each other with test scores or grades.      There was one on the Rockville/Bethesda border at the White Flint Mall, but the mall is gone.   (For that matter, until D B opens, are there any other decent arcades in the area?)   I hope it still opens. I am rather looking forward to it! I miss the one at White Flint.   Thank you! We'll give it a try. :)   *le sigh* I try one more google search as a last ditch effort after hitting submit, and I think I may have answered my own questionis it this? http://www.tracking-system.com/news/3-tracking-system-information/992-gps-device-accuracy-in-city-environments-.html   This may be a wacky question, but my google fu came up empty so I thought I'd ask here. My GF and I both have Verizon service. She has an iPhone 6, and I have the 6s. She's new to NY, I'm new as a weekend visitor, and we've both found that GPS on our phones w/ Google Maps is a lot less accurate in NY than it is elsewhere. GPS often has us in the middle of buildings or one street over when we're walking around. Is that normal?   Great book. I highly recommend it. It's simultaneously interesting, entertaining, and disturbing.   Those who chose to work with Vichy France WERE held accountable.   You may want to look at some of the other Pentagon City/Crystal City area apartments too, like RiverHouse, Crystal House, and the Buchanan buildings. (Water Park Towers in Crystal City is nice but more expensive than Park at Pentagon Row last I heard.)   My favorite reditor in my favorite forum? Be still my heart!!!!!!   Respectful? Polite? You said that Reform temples and rabbis makes things up as they go along, which directly led to the ragequit the OP refers to.   Israel also banned the Kach party in the early 90s, and to this day, they're considered a terrorist organization. Their closest counterpart in the Palestinian world, Hamas, was elected to run the Gaza Strip. Israel does indeed do the right things at times. It also does bad things at times. Few countries can be said to be all one or the other.   /r/holocaust , unfortunately.   Yep. That's what he's saying. So much for being a non-denominational subreddit.   If I understand correctly, you are arguing that the only legitimate form of Judaism is Orthodox Judaism, and in the process, ignoring rule 3 and 4 (3: disagreeing without being disagreeable) (4: this is a non-denomination subreddit).   The Torah also explicitly states that wearing clothing from two different fabrics isn't for us, and I don't particularly give a darn if my shirt is 100% cotton or a cotton/rayon blend. I also don't execute neighbors that work on Shabbat.  But I'll move beyond picking at anachronistic portions of the Torah that nobody follows, and move to your question of what carries weight beyond the Torah. (And note that I am certainly not claiming that the Torah itself carries *no* validity.) Modern interpretations may carry validity. Modern practice may carry validity. For many in the Reform, Conservative, Renewal, Reconstructionist, and Renewal movements, the laws of kashrut are not mandatory, be it congregants who never keep kosher, or who only keep kosher at home, or who make exceptions only for Chinese food. For many in the above movements, welcoming and sanctifying same-sex relationships, Leviticus be damned, is the right thing to do.  Intermarriage is just one more issue where Jewish thought and how the issue is treated across synagogues is not uniform.   We name things after people to honor them. We don't put all the names of historic figures in a hat and draw one out when naming a school or street, and we don't randomly generate names by computer. Naming a school after a figure is a celebration of them. There's a reason Alexander Hamilton is on the $10 bill and not Aaron Burr.   My goodness, you're in a cantankerous mood today.   In some religions, or subsections of religion, there is a hierachical structure, with an authority figure or figures at the top, be it a Pope (Catholic) or President (LDS), or a council, or other governing body. Judaism doesn't have that for the most part (the exception being the Chassidic movement where many follow the teachings of a particular Rabbi and his line of succession). There is a wide body of opinions on most topics in Judaism, even within a particular movement.  Because there is no authoritative answer that would cover every person identifying as Jewish, our opinions are fairly irrelevant without more details-details that would require a conversation with the person in question that would negate the need to ask us anything in the first place.  If we were a hierarchical religion, like, for example, Catholicism, we could answer the OP's question by citing the Pope, Cardinals, past Popes, etc. Given the decentralized nature of Judaism, sure, we could point to a Talmudic source or a modern-day rabbi, but there's no reason to think that the source we might point to here carries the same line of thinking as OP's love interest.   At no point did I say that faith does not count, /u/ibay770. I'm saying the opinions offered here probably don't count very much given the diversity of thought across Judaism.   Remember  celebrating.   This was pretty much the Supreme Court's reasoning in the lethal injection case last weekthe method was upheld by a 5-4 majority because the petitioners did not supply the Court with less problematic alternatives to the drug cocktail at issue.   No need for your to apologizeit's a common expression.   I don't wish to seem condescending, so if this is something you know already, I'm sorry. Jews don't have a pope-like figure. There is no one single figure who represents all of Judaism, or even all of one of the Jewish movements (like Orthodox, Conservative, Reform, etc.) So you're not going to a single, authoritative answer.  Without knowing what branch of judaism the woman you're interested in is affiliated with, we can't offer much insight into what her religious reasoning might be, beyond the traditional argument against intermarriage based on children and our small numbers already.  But really, this is a discussion you need to have with the woman in question. Respecting her as a person may mean that her religious beliefs really are an insurmountable barrier. Or not. But talking with her, and more importantly, listening to her, is far more important than the religious views of the folks here.   It's also worth noting that HIPAA doesn't just cover health care providers who are currently in the business of transmitting health info. electronically in connection with certain transactions  it covers health care providers who have EVER done so. The moment a health provider sends one single health record electronically, they are  permanently and irrevocably covered by HIPAA.   Trump may be able to recover unpaid rent, but surely only until the space is filled. I suspect he can't double-dip by getting damages from Andres AND rent from a different restaurateur (or other use of the space). As for an exclusivity clause, it depends on the specific text. Andres already operates a slew of other DC restaurants, so I'd be very surprised if he signed a contract prohibiting him from opening other restaurants in the area. Perhaps not a restaurant exactly mirroring the concept for the Trump hotel, but no new restaurants? That would be a dumb thing to sign. Maybe he did, but it would be surprising.   Amazon.com's choice to remove the Southern Flag was a capitalistic response to market demands.   Same way you'd report any other crimecall the police.   I used Bookstore Movers 2 years ago and loved them. Not the cheapest hourly rate out there, but they were careful, fast, and honest. You may well do better with their higher hourly rate but speed over a lollygagging low bidder.   The last I've read, he was not a lawyer-to be a lawyer, one must have a law license and not merely be a law school graduate. He graduated law school, he passed the bar exam, but as of May, the Virginia Character and Fitness committee did not yet render an opinion on whether to admit or deny his application to get a Virginia law license. No license=not a lawyer.   No different than than the U.S. Constitution. If a president were to be impeached, or a judge, etc., removal from office is the worst penalty the Senate could impose.    How so?   You'll "unregister" your car when you return your plates.  Don't forget to update renters or homeowners insurance.  Remember that you'll need to get your car inspected in VA-you may want to ask a VA mechanic to look your car over first to avoid painful surprises.  You'll be taxed for the part of the year you were in each place, I think? (My tax knowledge is quite minimal.) You WILL want to make sure you let your hob's HR folks know to withhold for VA instead of MD-I made that mistake when I moved. The refund from MD was nice, paying VA out of pocket before getting yang refund sucked.  Will you need a moving co? (I loved Bookstore Movers, personally. I have no affiliation with them, other than being really happy 2 years ago when they helped me.)  Do you have a landline and need to port the number?   PMed. :)   We usually get paid on Tuesdays by EFT, with checks going out two days later (although since I thought direct deposit was mandatory, the latter might just be an anachronism on the calendar)?   I spoke to a veteran in the agency who said that it means we have to get our TA in earlier, it needs to be approved earlier, etc., but pay will still run on the usual day the following week.   If an agency sends out a notice saying that time and attendance (TA) is due early because of the holiday, with TA due on June 25th, TA edits happening on June 26th, all TA including corrections to the processing center by the 30th, and pay calculation happening on June 30th, does that mean EFT pay will be going out on June 30th for that pay period, or will it be going out as scheduled on July 6th?  Or in tl;dr/EL5 terms, what does early pay calculation mean?   Where does one sign up if interested in being coached?   Scalia's dissent was petulant.   Chief Justice Robert's majority opinion was sassy: "It is implausible that Congress meant the Act to operate in this manner. See National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius, 567 U. S. ___, ___ (2012) (SCALIA, KENNEDY, THOMAS, and ALITO, JJ., dissenting) (slip op., at 60) (Without the federal subsidies . . . the exchanges would not operate as Congress intended and may not operate at all.)."   Today's decision was NOT a "favor" to the law (nor was the first decision). Today's decision was basic statutory construction. It is not ideological (and it certainly is not in any way unusual or rare) to read statutory language in context of the entire section or statute.  In February during oral arguments for Dept. of Housing and Community Affairs v. Inclusive Communities Project, Inc., Scalia said "When we look at a provision of law, we look at the entire provision of law, including later amendments...We try to make sense of the law as a whole."  In Justice Thomas's majority (and unanimous) opinion in 1997's Robinson v. Shell Oil Co., he wrote, "The plainness or ambiguity of statutory language is determined by reference to the language itself, the specific context in which that language is used, and the broader context of the statute as a whole."  There's nothing new about looking at the specific content of a statute's language and to the broader context of the statute as a whole.  As for Scalia, Thomas, and Alito's dissent in King v. Burrell, they are being intentionally disingenuous. As the Chief Justice pointed out in today's majority opinion, in Scalia's dissent (joined by Thomas and Alito) in National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius (AKA the first Obamacare Supreme Court case), Scalia said that without the Federal subsidies, "the exchanges would not operate as Congress intended and may not operate at all."  We look at statutes in context. As Scalia, Thomas, and Alito noted,  the subsidies were required for the law to operate as Congress intended.   Scalia suggested calling it SCOTUSCare because it's been before the Supreme Court twice and upheld twice. out of curiosity, how many times has the Supreme Court upheld the death penalty, and does this mean we should have pictures of the conservative justices on the walls of every death chamber in the country?   Not according to the South Carolina delegates: in the Dec. 24, 1860 Declaration of the Immediate Causes Which Induce and Justify the Secession of South Carolina from the Federal Union, South Carolina's delegates stated that they fought for slavery and against a state's right to refuse to return runaway slaves and against a state's right to not allow slave owners to bring slaves into their territory   There's no such thing as a secret Jewish-only networking event for industry players. That's an anti-semitic stereotype.      The Angry Bird franchise had to get its inspiration from something...   Yikes. Gotcha. Thanks!   I didn't even see the move. How did they pick his pocket?   Not all tofu dishes are intended to be a meat substitute. Many are, but there are plenty of East Asian dishes where tofu is part of a meat-based dish. For example, while mapo tofu is often westernized as a meatless dish, it is traditionally a tofu/ground pork dish.  EDIT: And nevermind. I should downvote myself for this one-I didn't notice the "vegetarian menu" part of your comment. Sorry. Tofu dishes and meat is common in some Asian cuisines, but they don't belong on a vegetarian menu.   Neat! Thanks for the response-I'll give that one a try!   Exactly this. My personal favorite quote from that decision is "[o]ne man's vulgarity is another's lyric.   We know this is unconstitutional, /u/repealedlaw. I'd go so far as to say that it is such settled law, police officers who arrest people for swearing are likely to not have qualified immunity from a civil suit.   Actually, no, but that sounds like an interesting app! :) Does it give you a new WTF fun fact every day, or is it a database of WTF fun facts, or...?   It was a sawed-off shotgun, and this was 1946 so cameras themselves weren't "so small."   Yep. It did. http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1947/01/07/page/1/article/camera-case-fugitive-slain-in-gun-battle   http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1947/01/07/page/1/article/camera-case-fugitive-slain-in-gun-battle   I did three searches on Reddit to make sure this wasn't already posted. :P It was such a neat story, I was surprised this was the first mention of it!   Sorry-it was an original source, as opposed to other pages that cited this one, so I thought it was the best choice.   The New Yorker article said: "ANNALS OF CRIME about the accidental shooting of Olga Trapani Rocco by Pearl Lusk, which resulted in the victim's losing her leg. This occurred in the Times Sq. subway station on Dec. 31, 1946. Pearl thought she was taking a picture of Olga, instead she was pulling the trigger of a swaed-off shotgun. Pearl, 19, and out of work, was picked up by an attractive man in the subway. He told her to shadow Olga and take her photo with the wrapped-up camera he gave her, as Olga was concealing stolen jewelry in her clothing Actually, the man was Alphonse Rocco and he was Olga's husband. She had separated from him and he wanted her back. When she refused to go back he threatened to kill her. She told the police and got protection but no one suspected the lengths Rocco would go to. The police trailed him to the Catskills. He would not surrender and tried shooting it out with the police and was killed himself. Olga could not recover any damages from the City as no proof of negligence on the part of the police department could be shown. They had no legal duty to protect her from Pearl, an unidentified individual."            Perjury is a criminal offense. It carries jail time. Is the risk worth $75? Really?   According to the Tenant-Landlord Handbook, "Tenants may be charged...if there is excessive damage to walls." Whether or not the scuff marks constituted excessive damage is impossible to judge from your question. It could depend on several factors included the expected lifespan of the paint, how deep the scuffing went, how many scuff marks there were, etc.   I don't know if this is the sort of question they can answer, but it couldn't hurt for you to call or email the county's housing division: http://housing.arlingtonva.us/get-help/rental-services/tenant-landlord-rights/  (Also, to settle my curiosity/concern given that I live in an apartment complex in Arlington, VA, mind PMing me with the name of the complex? :P )   Moreover, in a large swath of downtown DC, biking on the sidewalk is illegal (Central Business District).   Hamas is defining occupation as the State of Israel itself. Not what was captured in 1967, but the 1948 borders. Not much room for negotiation on Israel's part!   Oh for Pete's sake. Here is the Coca-Cola's website with an interview with Mr. T. Here is Mr. T's verified Twitter account, where there's a picture of him in the butterfly gear: https://twitter.com/mrt/status/607978622767505408  It's Mr. T.   Not exactly. I mean, I suppose it has worked out that way, but I posed the link, as did others, in response to redditors who thought it wasn't really Mr. T in the photo.   Not fake. http://www.fuzebev.com/   Except it is Mr. T. http://www.fuzebev.com/   In many states, where this would be a simple speeding ticket, no, you wouldn't need a lawyer. But this is Virginia, where it is a criminal matter. (See http://jalopnik.com/never-speed-in-virginia-lessons-from-my-three-days-in-1613604053 ) Beyond the potential for, you know, having to spend time in jail, it can affect security clearances, employment, and all other sorts of things.  Get an attorney. Get the best one you can find/afford. And do it immediately.   Not in store, but they do online, and it's covered by the same guarantee (and can even be returned in-store). Costco sells the Charge but not the Charge HR.   She wasn't there with her husband according to the Globe.   More that he's proving the point that he and his ilk hate Jews and not just Israel.   I'd suggest Nordstroms or Macy's for their return policiespretty much a money back guarantee without time limit.   Because that would add on to the cost.   Pretty much. If you work for the Federal government and you're not in a sensitive position or in a sensitive agency, your salary, position, agency, grade level, bonuses paid, and duty location are all a matter of public record, available online.    I recommend the HR due to the difference in bands. I tried the Charge, and found that it fell off easily. The Charge HR has a watch-style band and clasp that is much, much more secure.   http://www.fedsdatacenter.com/federal-pay-rates/  Go nuts.   There's many things to do at Dartmouth. As /u/qweasd1515 said, if you want to make outdoorsy things your life, you can. If you never want to go into the woods (although I encourage you to at least go on a first year trip), you can. And its easy to do a mix, spending some of your time doing outdoorsy things.  Beyond outdoorsy things, there's the Greek system, there's a zillion clubs, there's all the great speakers Dartmouth brings to campus, every Presidential candidate pretty much stops at Dartmouth during a campaign cycle, there's journalism and writing opportunities, video and board games people, and fantastic performing artists you can see for about $5 as opposed to the $50-$100 a ticket they charge elsewhere. (*sob* I miss cheap tickets. :P)  Is there any social stuff in particular you are looking for that one of us may be able to tell you about how/if its available at Dartmouth?   http://www.gofundme.com/paulkerr  My friend Anisha's father passed away on May 28th, and she is trying to raise money to cover the funeral expenses, with any overrun going to honoring his name by helping people wishing to further their arts education. (Details on the Go Fund Me page.)  Anisha's dad, Paul, lived with Alzheimer's for the past 10 years. Anisha became her parents' caretakers 5 years ago. A few years ago, Anisha beat cancer. And tomorrow is her 30th birthday.  She didn't ask me to share this here, but she did ask me generally to pass this on to my contacts and networks. Any financial assistance you can provide, however small, would be appreciated.   Their Bethesda location closed a few years ago too.    GAH! I got my first call from them today at 11, and my second one today at 1. I reported the call to the DEA, not that I expect that will help but one never knows.   And it goes beyond phone calls: http://edition.cnn.com/2015/05/27/us/fifa-corruption-investigation-why/   It doesn't matter where the stadiums are being built. And the severity of the charge has to do with the criminal acts alleged, and not merely the phone calls themselves. Phone calls and the like provide for jurisdiction, that's enough to theoretically get the FIFA defendants into a U.S. courtroom to face charges for the totality of their conduct that has a U.S.-based nexus.   The Constitution trumps the U.S. Code. Texas v. Johnson is the controlling case when it comes to attempts to ban flag desecration.   You may not be in the U.S., but you committed an act within the United States.  If someone on the Mexican side of the Mexico/U.S. border lobs a hand grenade over the border, they've committed a crime in both Mexico AND the U.S.  If you're outside the U.S., but call, email, fax, or otherwise cause ties within the U.S. in the commission of a violation of U.S. law, there may be grounds to charge you for it.  It's not personhood, it's that you committed an act within the U.S. that was criminal or in furtherance of a crime.   In and of itself, calling someone isn't a crime. Calling someone in furtherance of a bribery and/or wire fraud scheme is a criminal act.  Nobody is going to take the time and effort to indict you (nor can I see a country extraditing for it)  for calling someone in the US and asking them to buy you a small quantity of drugs for personal use. A big enough purchase to nail you as a drug dealer? Yes, it's quite possible.   http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/wp/2015/05/27/how-the-us-can-arrest-fifa-officials-in-switzerland-explained/?hpid=z1  The short summary is that the crimes alleged had an element that took place in the U.S., be it a visit (that was part of the crime) to the U.S., a call (that was part of the crime) to a person in the U.S., or some other jurisdictional nexus.  Under the U.S. extradition treaty with Switzerland, the Swiss won't extradite for tax-related crimes, but will for most other offenses. Whether that holds true when its members of a powerful worldwide group like FIFA remains to be seen, but that the Swiss cooperated in making the arrest is a promising sign.   There were so many things I went to last year (only three of which involved paying money for a pic, autograph, or Maurice LaMarche recording my voicemail message as the Brain), that I didn't get around to the board gaming area. I hope to do it this year, but no guarantees. :P   As far as I know, Rob will (along with other Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle voice actors), Maurice will not, but Jim Cummings (Winnie the Pooh, Darkwing Duck, etc.) will be there, Phil LaMarr will be there, etc.   There's nothing new or original about certain things falling outside the laws of surrounding areas, given that every state has its own set of criminal laws. What is legal in Kittery may be illegal across the Piscataqua River in Portsmouth, or vice versa.  The US approach to the sovereignty of Indian tribes is not unique in the world. The status and sovereignty of Canada's First Nations is largely controlled by Royal Proclamation of 1763. The status and sovereignty of the Mori people of New Zealand is large controlled by the 1840 Treaty of Waitangi. Issues of Native sovereignty and jurisdiction continues to be a source of struggle, tensions, collaboration, and the like in the US, Canada, and New Zealand alike, but it most certainly is not a unique problem in the world.  EDIT: Bwah? I've been downvoted for pointing out the factual inaccuracies in someone's comment, who turned around and deleted said comment (after my response) when it didn't stand up to scrutiny. Lovely.   My GF knew it as: "...These little children are asking you, To please come out so we can play with you..."  I knew it as: "Here comes a hunter with a big shotgun. He's gonna get you if you don't start to run..."   My girlfriend and I randomly started singing Mr. Sun, Sun, Mr. Golden Sun the other day, and we were quite surprised that our notions of the lyrics to the bridge of the song differed widely.  I googled it, and came up fairly dry about the origins of the song. This is pretty much what I found: http://mudcat.org/thread.cfm?threadid=44759  Can anyone explain the origins, or what your notion is of the proper lyrics?      I went to Awesome Con last year and had a fantastic time at the panels, getting a few photos (with Rob Paulsen and Maurice LaMarche, Cary Elwes, and Ernie Hudson), and walking around the floor.  There are some fantastic panels this year (hearing from George Takei may well be worth the cost of admission alone. He has a compelling personal story, both as one of the first prominent out Asian-Americans, as well as as a person who grew up in a Japanese internment camp). And the voice actors reading from a movie script is not to be missed! (Last year, they read Ghostbuster scenes.)       As opposed to cash, sure. But it's no different than the information gathered if one pays by credit card.   Fuck that. In the words of Supreme Court Justice Harlan in Cohen v. California, "One man's vulgarity is another man's lyric."   I'll second Good Stuff Eatery's mushroom burger as being delicious, and We the Pizza next door (same owners) has good vegetarian and meat pizzas.  On 23rd, Urban Thai is really good and does takeout and delivery.   The most important thing I was told the first week of BarBri was that the bar exam is a pass/fail exam, and every point above passing is time you could have spent with loved ones, friends, sleep, or hobbies.   (I have no connection to this story in any way, I was just outraged that someone would hit and run a mom and a baby in a stroller.)      Anything by Isa Chandra Moskowitz is usually worthwhile. The Veganomicon, Vegan with a Vengeance, Isa Does It, etc.   Seconded. It's easy to accidentally hurt your case when an insurance company goads you into blurting things out. Even as a lawyer myself, when the other person's insurance company started playing hardball after their insured driver rear-ended me in Georgetown (not far from where you were hit, actually), I stopped dealing with them and got my own lawyer.   A new bridge to VA would be fantastic, but would cost far more than the purple line, and would probably require coordination with Virginia that is unlikely to happen any time soon.  The Purple Line isn't throwing money at Bethesdait would go from Bethesda to New Carrollton in PG County, and includes stops in Silver Spring, Takoma Park, College Park (including UMD), etc. It would be positive for all of those areas, not just Bethesda. There would be the capacity for future capacity over the Wilson bridge, too.  It takes about 13 minutes by car without traffic to go from Bethesda to Silver Spring. It takes 20 minutes without traffic by bus. During rush hour, it takes a lot longer and the bus is worse than cars because the stops it makes amplifies traffic delays. It takes 45 minutes to go by metro currently because you have to go through the heart of DC and then back out again via the red line. The purple line would get from the Bethesda Metro Station to the Silver Spring Metro Station in 5 stops on a dedicated light rail. That makes a huge difference to people commuting, considering shopping, to people opening up or relocating businesses, etc. Major economic benefits can ensue.  I have no horse in this race. I don't even live in Montgomery County any moreI moved across the river to improve my commute from taking an hour to 15 minutes. But that's kinda my pointspeedy transit matters to people.   Of which Maryland is not paying full-freight, thanks to the Federal grant. And it is not as though Hogan is planning to actually take the money to fund school construction-he wants to put it towards roads, so either way, it's a heck of a lot of money towards transportation. The question is where would the best bang for the buck come from, and public transportation is a strong investment.   I enjoy the Sunday night trivia at Sine in Pentagon City. It's one of the pub trivias run by District Trivia. http://www.district-trivia.com   Marketing is the difference between a shoe and an unapproved new medical device. When it comes to the laws and regulations surround food, drugs, cosmetics, dietary supplements, and medical devices, the type of health-related claims one makes changes the regulatory scheme attached to a product.   I don't think you'll have a major difference in experience being 22 or 23 than anyone else, assuming that as a transfer, you wouldn't be there for 4 more years or anything. We have some older students, some due to discipline, academic, medical or other issues requiring them to take time off or extra time.  I personally only applied to Dartmouth (early decision). Had early decision not been an option, I'd have applied to a wide variety of schools, including several ivies, because who knows where you might get in, but it's not as though all Ivy League schools are equal. The experience you would have at Dartmouth is VERY different than the experience at Harvard, which is VERY different from the experience at Cornell, etc.   I believe what reaganveg is saying is that Freddie Gray was injured, in the van, before the second prison (aka the "witness", as reganveg put it) was in the van.   People come to pescatarianism for different reasons, just as people come to vegetarianism for different reasons (religious, ethical, health, etc.) As pescatarianism is not a commonly understood word (take a survey, and I'd be willing to bet a high percentage of Americans would think it was a religion and not a diet), when rsvping for parties, weddings, etc., it is often easier for pescatarians to say they are vegetarian, to ensure they don't get a meat-based meal.   *nods* It's good to ask, since I had a different experience than /u/treacherouseel. When I interned for the general counsel's office of a federal law enforcement agency, it was suit and tie every day. A fellow intern asked if on Fridays, we could go sans tie. The answer was no. (The law enforcement officers themselves were in jeans and t-shirts!)   I mean no disrespect, truly (not a troll), but if physical therapy, steroid shots, and a brace didn't work, what might be left other than surgery? Not that it would be a good idea to get surgery without being reasonably sure of what the underlying issue is, but it sounds like you have gone through the common non-surgical options already?  That said, I'm no doctor. Joel Morse in NW DC is a great podiatrist, and he may be able to help you. http://www.foxhallpodiatry.com   Based on my hiring date, I have to pay 3.1% of my paycheck towards retirement, so I make 2.3% less than someone of the same grade, doing the same job, hired a year earlier than me. That's not great for morale either.   There are still a few iPad-only apps I use. My favorite iOS game is Risk, which is strangely iPad only, even though it would look just fine on an iPhone 6 plus, or even the iPhone 6.  	116
                Glad I could help. Pm me if you have trouble finding Junior HR roles. Sales sounds intimidating but it's not that bad really but understand your reticence on that front.    Try and get an entry-level job in public relations / communications. Your writing experience will help immensely and there is a career path there. You could also consider a career in HR.   1. There are a lot of entry-level jobs here: http://tapwage.com/searchresult?SearchForm%5Bwhat%5D=entry+level SearchForm%5Bwhere%5D=  Look at the ones in sales, or project management  2. here is a list of junior HR jobs: http://tapwage.com/channel/talent-acquisition-rookies  3. Junior ad sales could be an interesting opportunity: http://tapwage.com/channel/selling-eyeballs  With your credentials, and openness to moving, you will likely be able to find a job if you try but you may need a pick a few areas and zoom in. Picking a field like HR, PR or sales is a good one because it gives you a career path as opposed to a job given that you are tired of doing lots of different gigs and starting over.    I totally understand how you feel. If you are at a  large firm that is on the downturn, older employees who have been there longer can get a little political and insecure when they see a younger employee "over-do" it or try to show that they are working hard. That's not to say that thats the case in this situation - it's very possible that you are misreading their general insecurities as resentment.   To stay on good-terms with your coworkers: 1. Be helpful. Try and make sure you are a team player. Maybe its me but reading your posts and comments, I get the feeling that you are measuring output in lines of code you produce rather than projects you help your team accomplish. Software engineering is a team sport so make sure you are focused on the teams objectives instead of just your own part of the puzzle. You will learn more that way too.  2. Stop measuring your output in term of time either.  Having been  code for a long time and worked with developers - beyond 40-50 hours a week, hours spent is rarely correlated with quality of work. If you want to learn more and be more valuable - spend the time learning the bigger objectives of the project /company and use your down time to research / get smarter and help with those objectives.   3. Don't speculate about how your coworkers feel about you. Ask them. Given you are new there, ask your coworkers out for coffee on occasion - and ask them for tips and guidance and their thoughts on how you could be more productive with the team.   I agree with other commenters that if you are a good engineer - the market is good enough where you won't lack for a job. But if you are going to work with the mindset that people are going to get fired and you don't want to - then you will absolutely give off a competitive vibe and coworkers will pick up on that. Instead you should go to work with a mindset of how I can help the team move forward.       Try out customer experience jobs at startups. They are generally open to people without a degree, some support remote work, and will allow you to build a career within an organization and hopefully grow as the space and the company grow. Jobs like these:  http://tapwage.com/channel/hello-customer-meet-startup  One note - any are based in NY or SF so you might need to move and those are expensive cities. But your admin and retail sales skills should work in your favor and hopefully it gives you a start to finding a career.              Part of your problem might be that your confidence has taken a hit since you graduated especially with that last job and that can often come across in your resume and your interviews.  There are a lot of interesting jobs in media where you can potentially get in on the ground floor and work your way up. A few options (with examples of types of jobs are below)  1. Try a a digital media startup. Your media background will come in handy and as the space explodes, you have a chance to get your foot in the door and grow alongside the company.   Jobs like these: http://tapwage.com/channel/diving-into-digital-media  An events coordinator, or social media associate might not be the most glamorous or high paying out of the gate but can get you in the door, and be a platform to build a career.  2. Consider a career related to the media but in sales. Something like ad sales. Hugely coveted and getting more an more important. Something like these: http://tapwage.com/channel/selling-eyeballs  An account exec job if you feel you have the people skills and sales demeanor or a yield analyst job if you are more quantitative  oriented  3. Maybe a junior marketing job at an entertainment company. Like these: http://tapwage.com/channel/the-audience-chase  You may need to start as an intern or a planning assistant. But you will likely get paid and again have a chance at building a career in the space.  If you are a good video producer or video editor, there are interesting jobs out there too but those tend to be freelance so unless you have the hustle and really want that career, it can be hard to eke a career out of that.   Good luck and feel free to pm me with further qs.    You could get an engineering degree but that won't necessarily translate to a great aviation job here in the US. You could instead do the following:  1. Work at an aviation related startup - like SpaceX, or Virgin Galactic or GoPro, or a big company doing aviation related projects They all need talented technology professionals and you could be great at those. Check these out: http://tapwage.com/searchresult?SearchForm%5Bwhat%5D=aviation+aerospace+software SearchForm%5Bwhere%5D=  Even google needs talented technology / software professionals on aviation related projects  2. Go to a big aerospace company like Boeing, Lockheed, etc. They all need great software engineers  3. Also get your private pilots license if you can (it's pricey ~$20-25k in the US) but gettable over a few years and really worth it. Maybe you could even get a job building / testing drones  Engineering is an interesting path but it's a bit commitment and it isn't clear that it will necessarily get you a meaningfully better or more directly aviation related role at these companies.

That's amazing. Even the nicer pool sticks on eBay seem to be $80-100.    I agree. I used to drive 30 minutes to work. Now I take a 15 minute train ride (different city). Such a big difference. Less road rage, I get to read and get composed for the day ahead. Commute is so important and so underrated.             If you want a robot reading a book to you, there are plenty of options but they just aren't very good.   I subscribed to instapaper briefly to listen to articles on the way to work but I couldn't really survive a single one. They just feel too clunky. The Guardian has a free "audio long reads" where authors read their articles out. Many are really really good and they make for great podcast equivalents.                           	39

 Me and my friends just wanted to play a game.We didn't think it would end up like this, I didn't think I would be here in this situation. I don't know how much time I have before..  Let me start at the beginning. It was Friday night, and the weekend was just around the corner and that means free time, lots of free time. My friends and I, normally get together and have a party of sorts. Sometime we throw big ones, other times its just us.This weekend we decided it was just going to be us. Few hours later, We're all sitting of the couch watching TV. "Lets play a game" Ryan says, my roommate.  "a game? what kinda game?" ask tom, my best friend. " oh, nothing much, Its like truth or dare" Ryan says. "like?" I speak up.  "yeah man, its simple. We sit in a circle and place one had in the middle of us, and say a few words and then we ask each other truth or dare questions" Ryan says.  "so its basically truth or dare? isn't that a little weird with just us?" tom asked, chuckling.  "Nah man, you see cause we wont be talking" Ryan says  "what do you mean?" i ask.  "You'll see, lets play. come on" Ryan says. tom an I look at each other, questioning this in our minds, then look back to Ryan and nod, giving him our approval.  "alright, give me a few minuets  , ill be right back" Ryan says as he gets up and heads to his room.  "leave it to Ryan to get us doing something weird" tom says  "its just a little harmless game, though im confused to what he meant by we wont be talking"I say  "ha ha, yeah, maybe it'll be gho-" "I'm back, lets get started" Ryan say interrupting tom.  "OK so what do we do? " I ask. "well, We sit in a circle. once we do that we place our hands on this peice of paper, and say this phrase "Aperire ostium mortuis messorem" three times" "Aperire ostium what?" ryan and i asked "I dont know, sound latin, whats on the paper?" i ask "nothing man, don't worry about it, trust me it'll be fun" Not wanting to ruin possible fun and Going against my gut feeling I agreed.  Oh man I should have said no.. I have to go (to be continued)   That every community for you, And most the time its lurkers or newcomes that dont know anything about the problems faced when allowing everyone through the gates, let alone the work put to develop the game, and make it online. when an error occurs or when it lags too much, or when maintenance takes too long. Those are the first to complain, from what ive seen. But the game is in beta still, open beta, but beta nevertheless. Bugs happen, and its our jobs as testers* to report the bugs,the glitches, and anything else problematic. It is also our job to suggest things to the developers.  *We become testers once the we start playing the alpha or beta, open or closed.   What is prestige? Like what happens when you do prestige? Do I want to Prestige?   So going to the tutorial place, after talking to the chick, right when you start, The whole place is bright yellow. Any idea how to fix it? Im useing the Intel HD 4000, ik it isnt the ideal card for gaming, but its what i got. Any help would be much appreciated , especially from people who have the same card or an intel gpu   If anyone has played all the classes, Could you say which one was the most fun to play? I understand its a rather complicated question, since everyone's opinion of "fun" is a little different. What was the most fun for you?   I feel like im trying crack for the first time, and Im being teased   Was about to post this update, someone beat me to the punch    Which class looks the purttiest?   normally, in just about any mmo, the time frame they give for maintenance is usually off by 30mins-1hr , sometimes 2hrs but not often, they try to keep users in the loop about this. In my experience anyways   Thanks for the confirmation , looks like ill be in this for a long run.   I heard every class is obtainable, even gunner and berserker through simply playing the game,but it takes some time, is this true?    I have no clue, as the first time ill be playing the game will be in a few mins, but Using logic, and assuming they were logical when developing skyforge, I say Yes you can progress properly. Doesnt make sense to not have it that way. not to me. but again, I know nothing so you shouldnt take my word for it.  	12
 Here's Part 1 incase you missed it. http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/2mlkar/the_man_who_lives_under_our_house/   Here is Part 2 http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/2mpg6u/the_man_who_lives_under_our_house_part_2/?   So I fought back as much as I could. First I started by prepping the house to be ready to be painted at any moment (I.e. Removing everything from the wall and scooted all furniture away from the walls). Than with a small bottle of holy water and dispersed it around our home. As soon as I finished I began painting the walls white. It is one of the best ways to expelled unwanted evil from a home. It only works if you paint every wall with a fresh coat of white paint. It only works however if you get every single part of the wall. If you were to miss a small section it would render all that you've done useless. It was a trick my Grandfather taught me that I have performed before.    I was very thorough on my paint job. I made sure that every single spot on the wall was covered. I was very happy with myself. I knew for sure I had won and we would finally be at peace. Little did I know I missed a very key portion on my paint job, in our living room we have a closet. And inside that closet is a wall that is an exterior wall as well, allowing this evil man under our house a wide open door.     We had peace for about 8 months. It was the best 8 months of my life. We were no longer dreading returning home, in fact some days there would be no other place Id rather be. I returned back to school while keeping my job in the Air Force. Up until about a week ago life was great. Thats when everything came to a screeching halt.  My girlfriends son had woke up one morning around 5 am and felt that it would be funny to put a pillow over his Grandmothers face (girlfriends mom) and see how long he can hold it there for. My girlfriend and I woke up to a blood curdling scream as her son came running in crying. He told us that his grandmother had thrown him from her bed. Thats when we noticed a faint gasp for air coming from the room. My girlfriends mom was struggling to catch her breath as she told us what had happened. Apparently as my girlfriends son had held the pillow over her face he was saying that the man does not want her in his room anymore. We asked why he would do a thing like that and he said that he didnt want to but the man made him. I felt ice run through my veins as soon as I heard that. He was back. I failed and he is very angry now.  That night no one got any sleep, from the exception of my girlfriends son. Her mother had locked her door because she couldnt trust her own grandson anymore. One night had broken our happy family. Fast forward to last week. My girlfriend, her son, and I were on our way to the store to get some groceries. Her son had fallen asleep and it was nice and quiet in the car. We were too tired to talk, we just wanted quite. All of the sudden my girlfriends son had woken up and said in the most monotone voice a 6 year old could have I used to be named Charlie and I was a very bad person, now I am living in my house again. We pulled over as quickly as possible and woke her son up. He had no recognition of what was said and as soon as we said the name Charlie he began to cry and say that is the man that moved my bed and hurt my grandma. My girlfriend has not been the same since. She is completely shelled off from the world and nothing seems to phase her. Every day since we hear things in the house fall off from where it used to sit. Things as small as the remote falling off the counter to dishes and silverware falling out of the sink.  About 3 hours ago I woke up to a knock on the door. Three loud thumps. I slowly crept down the stairs and I once again heard another 3 loud thumps. As I got to the front door I peered through the peep hole and saw nothing. So I opened the door all of the way and once again saw nothing. Then from behind I heard another loud thumps, but it was coming from the closet. As I opened it my girlfriends son was standing in there. Smiling. And he said Charlie is home and he doesnt want you in there! I screamed for my girlfriend and ran upstairs with her son. I woke her up and grabbed my keys and we ran out of Charlies house. As we were leaving all of the water in the house began to run. The sinks, the showers, even the water from the refrigerator was running. And it was hot. Hotter than I have ever been able to make it before. Everywhere the water was running was steaming. Even the refrigerator had been steaming. We begged for her mother to come with us. But it was locked, we were banging on the door yelling her name, but she never answered. I couldnt with all my strength break that door down. It would not bug an inch. We ran to the car and took off. My girlfriends son had been screaming the whole time at the top of his lungs. Were could we go at a time like this, with a child who could not stop screaming.  I went to the only place I felt could help me. My grandfathers house. He is the only person I felt that could help us at a time like this. They only lived about 30 minutes from our house, and it was the worse car ride of my life. For 30 minutes straight my girlfriends son screamed at the top of his lungs. My ears were burning and I felt like the ride would never end. As we reached my grandfathers house he came running outside as my girlfriend cried and begged him to help her son. As my grandfather lifted her son out of the car, the screaming immediately stopped. He brought her son into his room and asked if my grandmother and himself could be with him alone for a few hours and asked us to wait in the living room. Its almost been three hours since weve heard anything from them. And cannot get ahold of my girlfriends mother. We are sitting in a dimly lit living room. I feel dead on the inside. I hope my grandfather can help and that its not too late. I will post an update as soon as I can.              Its Arse Face! http://www.google.com/search?q=arse+face client=ms-android-verizon site=webhp source=lnms tbm=isch sa=X ei=ky4SVemUDMLkgwSK-YKACQ ved=0CAcQ_AUoAQ biw=360 bih=615  	2
 Can you describe how you and the others looked like   So did you wake up right after you saw her?   Thats crazy mustve been pretty intense of a dream   You woke up with wet pants? Was it piss?   Thats intense as hell.    One of my dreams I was back at my parents house. it was pitch black outside and the only light was from the kitchen. Where my sister and little brother were in the kitchen. It felt like it was reality, I was in complete control of my actions. But I was walking towards the kitchen when I heard some noise coming from my sisters room. So i decide to check it out. Standing at the entrance of the hallway I felt a chilling breeze and a creepy puslating sound. The hallway seemed to get darker as I stared down it. Again I hear the noise of something moving around in my sisters room so I advance down the hallway. My sisters room is at the end of the hallway and my room is directly to the left. I walk up to the door and hear movement again but the puslating stopped. I am pretty scared at this point worried about what I might find. So I crack open my sisters door to reach for the lightswitch before fully opening the door. All of a sudden my bedroom door starts to creek open and out of fear and instinct I immediately shoulder check my door. Though it only budge a little open and I look up to see two bony hands with claws for nails and skin is a blood red. Im in shock to see half a face staring from behind the hands through the crack of the door. Within a second the door swings open and I stumble into this creature dressed in a raggedy black robe. Im staring it in the face at this point as it grins with little sharp teeth a horn for a chin and radiant yellow serpent eyes. Two horns stuck straight out on each side of its head. Then a gust of wind comes rushing through and send me flying into the wall. As Im sitting against the wall after falling looking up at this demon I cant help but feel hopelessness and paralyzed with fear. It creeps backwards into my room never turning its back to me and slowly creeps into my closet. Still poking its gead out to watch me, I finally regain some composure so I crawl backwards out of the hallway and started saying a prayer I remember from catholic school and a white light appears over me and then I wake up. So after I wake up I start pacing around my studio apartment. I walk outside to get some fresh air and the area is dead silent, no cars no one in sight on a friday night which is usually loud from people partying. In the distance I hear a women screaming like if she was in pain, chanting from some deep voices and a trumpet occasionally being blown. So I go back inside even more creeped out. I tried to go back to sleep but I ended up staring at the ceiling until it was time to get ready for work.   Now that is creepy as hell   Im curious of demonic dreams. I have had 2 creepy ones so far. I want to know your experience.   I wish they would stop their culture of being offended about things that dont apply to them  	9

 That's exactly it. Thank of a single spot in space the the longboarder passes through every time they complete a circuit.  Now think of how much time the camera sees the longboarder versus the background. Clearly, the background is what is seen for a majority of the time. Since there's no extra light in the longboarder vs the background, the background is what shows up in the final picture!  You could do many things to change what shows up and get various results and degrees of "transparency" for the boarder dude/dudette    Have you seen the show Person of Interest? In the second and third seasons, one of the characters has a link to a super-powerful AI. I think the show handles it wonderfully, especially in some of the episodes of Season 3. It's worth a watch for inspiration!   I wish the choice was mine. Or I wish I had the strength to make the choice.   Please leave me in my misery. It's quite peaceful here.   One of the things I hated about Spotify was that they didn't have Porcupine Tree (only two albums) or Steven Wilson (one album + a few songs). Apple music has a lot more...woooo!   She had stairs to climb at home, so she would wear them on and off, but certainly didn't wear them all the time. You'll be okay soon... Just hang in there. Take as much encouragement and as little advice from Internet stranger as possible. Your foot and doctor know best, so listen to both!  EDIT: By them I mean it :)   My friend had a stress fracture, and after six weeks, she was fine. Assuming yours is similar and not much more serious, It's just rest that you need. Once you get back to running, you'll start off slower of course, but you'll be back to your original form in a few weeks.  The important thing is to listen to your feet once the cast comes off, and not push it. Two years later, the few weeks you lose won't matter. But you'll regret it terribly if you push yourself and cause a more serious injury.   I think the OP meant that the hike took a day each way,  not that they stayed only for a day    I'm attending a friend's wedding in Switzerland and I then plan to hike along the via alpina from Geneva to Nice (about 550 km). Does anyone know the scene in terms of camping along there?  From what I read, there are a lot of huts. But are there enough that I won't need to take a tent along at all? What about a stove?   Any other hints and tips would be greatly appreciated!   And you shit the food that doesn't have value to you. Har har   Yes, I think the middle path is the best path. Where you invest wisely, but also realize that food and cheer in the present is also important, if possible :)   *Hoarded* gold can't. That's one thing you can take away from the quote. Unused gold/money has only potential value. The value is realized when it is used/unhoarded.   I'm planning on hiking from Geneva down to Nice in late August/September..Will our travels intersect?   Contacted Customer Service and they said they would fix it within 48 hours.   Forget the fucking tree. If you were falling down and there wasn't anybody around, would you make a sound?  What if all the people you loved were around you? Would you make a sound then?  I haven't and I wouldn't.   Hmm...I think I agree with you.  The study says this too, though:   Westerners with a Christian background also became more tolerant after being exposed to Buddhist concepts, though only among those with a predisposition for valuing the welfare of all people and an aversion towards authoritarianism  I wonder what they mean by by that...that only those with a predisposition for valuing the welfare of all people had their prejudices reduces?   That's because in the inverted method, you start with the plunger already in a bit, so you fill in less water :)  In the straight side, you can fill water from the filter all the way to the top.   I disagree, but this is not the place for this discussion :)   This doesn't really show that one is more true than the other: Buddhist concepts reduce prejudice, or that the people who choose buddhism are less prejudiced already.   On other hand: in India, Buddhism rose as a response to the caste system, i.e. to reduce prejudice that was at the time, extremely inherent to Hinduism.    Nice video, thanks!   Android has excellent reddit apps -- Reddit Sync, Reddit news for example.   This really resonates with me, thanks! I'm no longer young either, and it's time I let my mind focus on the experience of taking the shot rather than the lens I'm looking through :)   DEITY is well... the Department of Electronics and Information TechnologY (acc to deity.gov.in)   When I was in grad school, I had no money and my brother gifted me a D40. I loved that thing and took thousands of pictures over 5 years.  Now I'm a little better off financially and am looking for a camera...I thought having more options would lead to a much better choice, but I've now bought and returned/resold the following cameras (and corresponding lenses at times):  EPL3 - NEX6 - D5300 - D7000  I haven't felt the same magic or freedom I felt with the D40. In fact, I'm beginning to feel like I'm setting myself up for disappointment in always looking for a better camera, but on the other hand, every camera feels like I'm settling.  Do any of you feel the same about your gear? Any advice?  EDIT: Thanks for all your responses, guys. Getting out there and shooting is the important part. I get that, but I really have to train myself not to think of the gear. It was easy when I couldn't afford better when it was forced upon me that I couldn't have better gear. Photography really is an emotional thing for me, and I really want it to stay that way :)   I use Rhombus. It's not bad.   Sent my story across. Thanks for doing this (even if you don't get to mine)!   Congratulations on an amazing transformation. Your will power and mental strength is really inspiring   I think there's an India Coffee House in Bangalore too...somewhere near MG road.  I can give you directions to the shop where my dad buys his coffee...maybe you'll like it:  Go to Gandhi Bazaar (Uber if you don't know how to get there) and ask someone for directions to "Srinivas Coffee Roasters". You can walk there from wherever you get off the cab. It's just like I described -- small place with one guy. It really doesn't look anything like anything you would find in Forum mall. I just looked for it and there certainly wasn't a website. You might encounter broken english :) While there, eat the masala dosa at Vidhyarthi Bhavan -- it's awesome. Actually...eat the spicy masala dosa there and then have a cup of coffee! I do that at least once on every trip back home. Sorry...got a bit carried away!  Also buy the Indian coffee filter and learn to use it if you don't know how already. Have it Indian style w/ hot/steamed milk (but no/less sugar) and see how you like it :)   If you want, you can PM me, and I'll give you more details!    There are lots of shops that sell beans. India has a very strong coffee culture, but it's not well advertised like here, and the culture (as it existed before) is very different. The shops are really small (source: I'm from Bangalore). The shops aren't fancy, or anything. They're just a guy and lots of beans and big burr grinder if you want them ground. My dad was telling me that when he was a kid, they would buy green coffee beans, go get them roasted at a roaster and then come back home and grind them by hand at home.   The fact that Indian coffee is milk and sugar doesn't make it automatically bad. In my house in India, the stuff we get out of our coffee filter is so thick that you have to add milk. The milk is part of the flavor, and not there to hide it. It's just a different way of making coffee. Plus we don't add sugar at home. It's also drunk in small amounts at once, but lots of times. If you visit south Indian homes, you'll see that the first thing they offer you is coffee. Conversations happen over coffee in every house.   I use an Aeropress and Hario mill and Stumptown at home here in Seattle, but when I visit home, I really don't feel like I'm having inferior coffee when I drink the super-strong 4 oz cups of filtered freshly ground coffee and milk.  What India does not have is a strong CAFE culture. The cafes (so far) have really bad coffee, that I can agree. Cafe Coffee Day, Costa Coffee...all of them sucked when I tried them.   Plus, they're all aping the espresso-latte trend instead of showing off India's own culture. This is not in itself a bad thing. I do hope Starbucks helps Indian cafes bring up their latte game.  EDIT: I just realized -- North India is, indeed like you say, predominantly tea country. I'm from the South, so results may vary.   Oops, I think you're right!    For the drummers out there, this seems to be in 5/3 (5/6?) in parts of the song and the solo. Cool stuff!      You were The Stranger    Doesn't this paper assume that there _is_ in fact, condemnation of the Zors' treatment of the Aree?  It seems the moral "consistency" becomes subjective. If you condemn the treatment and are still non-vegan, you are being inconsistent  If you don't condemn the treatment (food chain, tastes good, law of land, mighty wins) and you're non vegan, consistency is maintained.         So, I had a friend staying over with me, and he left me a very small amount of weed...and I, having never rolled my own joint, have no idea how to start.  How do I? Is there a nice peaceful online guide I can read for this?     Needed to hear this today...thanks!   Article is wrong. I bought a sim-free iPhone 6 and have had 4G LTE on AT T without any issue, out of the box   Man, he's awesome.  Also, I miss my mom :(      Walking -- climbing works too (I have spikes, ice axe, crampons). I guess I could snowshoe if that's a good thing to do around there as well!  The only restriction is that I'll be alone and don't have much experience with Winter Camping in the backcountry, in snow.   I randomly booked a flight to Reno for the first weekend of Feb, and want to go backpacking. I land Saturday morning and leave Monday morning...  Does anyone have suggestions for some short and beautiful (15-20 miles total) backpacking trips that I could do. Loops would be awesome, but out-and-back works too!        Go out and play!    Thanks!  I'll edit the profile to be a bit more descriptive about my travels!   Thanks!   Also, good point about the pics...I'm looking for more pics with my pretty face as I write this!   Thanks!   After your comment, I spent half an hour looking for more pictures, but I can't find ANY recent ones that have my face in them...Time to dig out the old backup hard drive!   Yeah...Doesn't help that none of my friends are single :)  Well, what can I do..I'll just keep at it, and maybe my winning smile will win someone over!      There's actually a few things to consider:  1. Timeline: Most companies that release "crippled" products do so because of deadlines and timelines, not because of increased customer satisfaction along the way. 2. Competition: I think this is an extremely important factor, especially in cars. If a company releases a detuned/undertuned car, a different company will release a better performing car for the same price. Car 1 will be reviewed badly, and sell badly.   On the other hand, if companies *could* get away with it, they absolutely would. Intel comes to mind, as mentioned in some of the other comments  Edit: Ethics aren't important at all. An ethical company tries to make customers happy WHILE maximizing profits AND staying ahead of the competition in at least one factor of their product/design   Three months ago, I went into a bad spiral of I don't know...sadness. I couldn't work (I told my manager I had "personal problems", thankfully he understood).  I thought I'd clawed my way out of it.  Today, I went on a date. The date actually went well.   But...I came back home and cried. Me...a 31 year old male. I don't know why I'm crying.  The scariest thing is that I thought I had close friends. Then I thought of who I could talk to right now about the fact that I'm dying here, and there was no one. Not family, not friends.  I've gone into a shell after the last few months and I can't come out. I don't know what to do. I'm lost...   Actually no. moms implies multiple moms. Mom's could mean possession or Mom is, depending on context.  The rules that apply to the word 'it' do not extend beyond it.      I think he's talking about Attentive Display, which is the thing that's supposed to keep the screen awake when you're looking at it. That feature is certainly broken -- my screen keeps turning off as I'm reading stuff on it   Wow.. No way in hell I could have done that. May you have many more years with this superpower that usually so favors the young    Lol..yeah that I can agree with! No sleep and death after sounds more achievable than waking up    How old are you? At 31, there's no way I'm drinking till 3 AM and waking up to run at 6   The first line has six   The second line, also six   The third line has five   Is "here" one or two   I think one, and go with it   Poetic license      2014 it is!  http://forum.xda-developers.com/moto-x-2014/general/ota-pure-edition-lollipop-5-0-t2932625/   Drag files here or just start typing. Imagine those poor files, being dragged everywhere, against their will.  But then, it isnt really against their will, is it?  People are rioting in Missouri and here I sit on my bed in the bedroom me a sort of conservative Indian guy on the bed in the bedroom sort of high and sort of drunk and that couchsurfing lady is in the living room just about five minutes away from snoring and weve just seen Guardians of the Galaxy and people are rioting in Missouri and a sort of innocent kid died and a sort of guilty cop now is free except hes sort of not a cop any more but all the punctuations gone away but the feelings stay and I feel sort of sad for all the kids that die but Im so far way that I dont really understand and there I can see the punctuation coming back.  Heartbreak doesnt make a sound, though Im sure there have been poems written about it. Maybe its the sound of silence shattering in slow motion. Is the sound of my heart breaking here louder than the sound of glass and guns and riots and rage in Missouri? Is my sorrow greater than their anger? It is not greater, but I cant help that it is a shallow pond that is getting me wet, as many roaring waterfalls plummet with the force of a million voices elsewhere.  I wish all the grammar and all the structure would leave, not needed by either me the writer or you the reader, and we would communicate with pure meaning. Who knows what is lost between my mind and the keys and and all the electricity and your screen and your eyes and your brain. Do we really know each other?  I think I know the sound that heartbreak makes. Every heart makes a different sound. Even the same heart sounds different at different times. Sometimes its a glass of whiskey, shattering against the wall. Sometimes its a fist punching a wall again and again and again and again till the sound is softened by swelling. Sometimes, its the silence of tears. Sometimes its the joy of freedom. There is no certainty and certainly no consistency.   People are shooting at police. Police are shooting at people. Police are people. How does it get to this?   My day today wasnt bad. My head is aching a bit. Its a bit heavy and Im high and low. High and low. I was laughing at the movie, now Im saddened by Missouri. And Israel. And immigration. I wish everyone found peace, you know. Not the peace of war and peace. But the peace of a light heart. The peace of a satisfactory silence. The peace of a broken heart hopefully picking up its own pieces and patching itself back together. Everyone should be at peace.  I remember Kalalau. I remember those people living there on the beach. They were at peace. But their peace was born of ignorance. Could peace come with knowledge? Could there be peace in misery?   The silence fills my ears and I can feel my eyes closing. I yawn bigly. Ill be asleep soon, while the world burns in a hundred thousand places. While fifty thousand people have bad sex and fifty thousand people have good sex, and fifty thousand people sleep in their bed with no one to hug.  I think you find what you look for in the world. Forrest Gump, he had it wrong. You get the chocolates you pick out, and the chocolates you pick from that big box of life chocolates, it isnt chosen by you. Your choice is but the interface to a million little events and books and scoldings and experiences that lift your arms, open your fingers, reach for that chocolate that is either joy or sorrow or anger or lust or sloth or video games or mountains or god or God or NoGod or MaybeGod or love or hate or regret or joy and it all those things in the past and present that guide you into the future where you become one or not or die or live or do something or nothing but even nothing is something. Maybe its because Im high that the full-stop runs away from me and my thoughts have to run really hard to catch up but because theyre running and stumbling, nothing is clear and everything is a mess of words on the page like the villains head after its smashed in with a hammer.  Except, I dont know my thoughts and I dont know what a smashed-in head looks like. Except in the movies.  Guardians of the Galaxy: Good movie. Sad news is sad, but there is hope. Some people will live and every one will die.  Good night.   With evernote there's also the Food app which automatically finds recipes in your notes and presents them nicely when it can      It goes away if you reboot when you see the problem, or before you connect to the car BT.  Sucks, though that that's necessary. Hopefully next SW update will fix it   I've had this issue for a while. I've tried lots of things including reconnecting the phone, etc.  The only reliable way that works is to reboot the phone every time it happens. Then it works fine, till after 2 or 3 more times, it goes bad again :(  But at least you can reboot your phone every morning and have realiable audio   Avial, a band from the south of India has Indian sounding metal(ish) songs. I love this one: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ik9qHKCr8Rc (I don't think they're a band any more)...   Yes, yes I'm having this issue too!  It goes away temporarily if I restart my phone.  It went away more permanently when I deleted the car bluetooth from my phone, deleted phone from the car, restarted both phone and car, and reconnected bluetooth. All was fine for 3 days and then yesterday night, it was back!     I really like the Nokia Here app, better than GMaps in fact, except for two things:  1. No biking directions, which is okay, because I can bike where i can walk 2. No Google Now integration. This is the thing that breaks it for me. My most common use case for maps is talking to my phone and telling it to navigate to home, or a restaurant. I wish Google gave us the option/API to use Here Maps as the default.   Stone Gardens! It's mainly a rock climbing/bouldering gym, but they have a free weights section with nothing more than the basics: squat rack, free weights and lots of plates :)    There's lots of things over the last five years that have led to this. Not any single thing, but many tiny hammers chipping away at my skin and bone till nothing of any importance remains. I don't use a throwaway, so I won't go into too much detail...but like the comment above says, I just hope I find enough energy to continue hanging in there..    Thanks for your kind words...Let's see where my life goes...I really hope I have the courage to stand up.   I'm just tired. Today, as I was driving my car, I was by the lake and just wanted to drive in it. I have no clue why I didn't. Maybe I'm a coward.  There are people who love me, I don't know why. Maybe because they've never seen me at my lowest, or even low.   Suicide sounds so peaceful, for me at least. And if there's one thing I'm certain of, it's that it's only my pain that I'm feeling now. But even as I'm thinking of killing myself, I know I won't do it. I just like to dwell for a bit in the thought of a final peace.  I can go rest my face on the grill to distract myself, or cut off one finger. But I won't do that either, and I don't know why. Maybe I don't want my family to go through all that drama. Maybe I don't want to disappoint them. But then, am I really giving them joy if it's all a lie and I curl up into my blanket and cry the night away as soon as I turn around?  I don't know. I read the posts on here a lot. You guys are brave, both the ones that find a reason to live on and the ones that don't. I feel like a coward...just hanging on to a rope of nothing because I don't know to do anything else.   Not OP, but on occasion, I write code for robotics applications...and bam, trig!   Ah i see why you're saying... My bad. They should be thinking about plating in my opinion, but unlike vocabulary, I have no real knowledge here and I'll take your word for it :-)    That's not the usual context for the word "afterthought". It usually indicates something thought about after whatever you were doing was done. http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/afterthought    You fought the good fight...Good luck with all the things.    I just received mine and it's just a joy to hold. The wood (mine's the teak finish) feels awesome, the aluminum frame feels awesome, the size is awesome....  Moto Voice is okay. It's kind of slow at times, but overall understands me just as well as the baristas as Starbucks when they try to write down my name.  I thought I about be excited about Moto Voice, but the best feature of the phone is Active Display. I just keep waving my hands over the phone, marveling at how it lights up telling me what's new.  Lovely phone.   Yeah, it was great fun overall. Because we got to hike on the rim, we got the canyonlands-type views along with the slot views :)   I went there with friends last weekend, and it was a great trip. The canyons in Utah are a completely different experience from my usual mountain+lake hikes here in WA      It sucked me right in.   30 year old in same boat. No nice things. No anchors in life. Sinking, floating aimlessly...I have no clue what's going on any more, and I'm tired.   Have you heard anything by Sigur Ros? They have a lot of epic sounding ambient stuff, though it is with vocals. On the other hand, it's Icelandic (?), so it's as good as instrumental for practical purposes :-) listen to their album kveikur.. It's one of my favourite albums!    Yup, me too :(   Oh no...Didn't know about that!   It's 9 miles Round Trip, and about 3000 ft gain, I think. So it's hard or easy depending on what those numbers mean to you :) We started climbing by about 8:30 and were down by 3 including a break for lunch and a nap at the top.   Here's a blog post I wrote about it: https://pritamps.exposure.co/hidden-lake-lookout    It's in the North Cascades, just outside the national park. In fact, the border of the national park is where this pic was taken from. We had a dog with us, so we didn't go into the park.   There's a bunch of these lookouts and they all offer magnificent views.  http://www.wta.org/go-hiking/seasonal-hikes/summer-destinations/fire-lookout-hikes  Don't believe WTA when they say these are Summer destinations. Snowshoeing up these trails is a lot of fun!      Plus the LG G3 16 GB version has only 2 GB of RAM   With the paper filter, you can plunge out the grounds and the filter together over a trash can.. With metal, you have to remove the filter by hand, then plunge out the grounds, then rinse.   Not that that's not easy, it's just harder than for the paper   I was glissading about 3 weeks back and injured my lower back. So now, for the last two weeks, my back has been hurting a decent amount. Not too much - I can walk and talk and work and be happy without having to cry out loud.  However, I decided to take some time off running to rest while I recover. The problem is, it's been 3 weeks and I still haven't recovered fully...and I really want to get back to running! All the trails must be so lonely without me.  I'm 30 now, and my body isn't what it used to be at 22 :) So I ask, is it okay to run with lower back pain, or should I wait it out a bit more?    If you're on AT T, Towelroot works. Look for towelroot on Google, go the website, download and install the apk and you're done! If not, IORoot is rumored to work, but I'm on AT T, so I didn't need to explore other options  After that, go to the Xposed website, download and install the APk  Then go to the Google play store, look for G3 tweaks, and install the APK :)   This is an emotional rant more than anything else...feel free to ignore.  I saw all these reviews saying the NEX-6 took amazing photos...and maybe it does.   I came to the NEX-6 from a Nikon D40 with an Olympus E-PL3 in between. I was determined to reduce the size of my camera bag.  At first the E-PL3 just felt wrong, and now the NEX-6 just feels wrong. The Nikon D40 somehow just felt...real.   Maybe it was the viewfinder? The NEX-6 has an EVF, but it's not really much better than seeing it on the LCD. Maybe I'm just technologically backward?   I don't know...Maybe I just need time to get used to it? Anyone else have a similar experience?  EDIT: Wow..I was off reddit for a day...thanks for all the responses! I'll give it more time and if it doesn't work, with upgrade to a nice DSLR....maybe even go all the way to full frame..My backpacking bag won't be happy, but maybe I will!        Reading all the replies has convinced me against the Mr. Coffee, thanks!!  Is there a good grinder below $150 that can handle the french press?   Wow...thanks! I'm convinced about the Encore now..but what would your pick be (in a similar price range) for a French Press?  What about the Aeropress?   I've been using a Hario Mill Skerton + Aeropress for the last year, and I've been quite happy with it. However, I drink only a cup or two a day at home.  My dad is visiting and he drinks a lot of coffee. I bought a larger french press for him, and now I'm thinking of getting an electric burr grinder so he doesn't have to grind by hand all the time.   What's the difference between a $35 one (http://www.amazon.com/dp/B004T6EJS0) and the Baratza Encore that I see recommended on here over and over. Is the Encore really worth all that much more, assuming I won't be using either for anything other than the Aeropress or the french press?  EDIT: You guys convinced me thoroughly. I bought the Encore. My dad will probably be mad to see me spending $130 on "just a thing to grind coffee"...but Oh well...the taste of the coffee better be worth it :)   Porcupine Tree - Start of Something Beautiful   I had a similar experience one day...After much investigation, I discovered that my router was losing connection every few seconds, which was causing the G3 to keep disconnecting and reconnecting to the network. Thus the battery drain.   I only noticed because my laptop kept disconnecting as well..   Your wish has already come true! Well.. Has been approved to come true, I mean. http://www.mercurynews.com/crime-courts/ci_26061420/golden-gate-bridge-board-approves-funding-suicide-barrier      Solid advice about listening to my body. I think I'm pretty good at it, and I've seen what happens if you don't!   Thanks!   Hey! I live in Seattle, but both my trail runs have been in Oregon (Monument Peak and Peterson Ridge). The Columbia Gorge is one of my favorite places in the world!  I'm in agreement with all of your rules, except for keeping tabs on my shoes. But only because I've never done that. I will keep all of this in mind. We have very similar running philosophies :)  The 50 I'm looking at is not really an event. It's the West Rim trail in Zion National Park. 48 miles, 7000 ft gain, lots of fun :)  Good luck at Mt. Hood!    What's a good training program to get to 50 miles? My most recent trail run was a 20 mile trail run (Peterson ridge).  I have very good endurance (well...relative to my peers, I guess). The 20 miles didn't tire me too badly, but my feet were hurting quite a bit. So, I guess I should have increased distance in a more planned manner, rather than jumping into it like I did.   What kind of training program should I follow? The simpler, the better...I like my runs to be peaceful. Pain is okay, but I don't want to be constantly monitoring my heart rate and so on...Ideally, the program would get me to 50 miles in 9-10 months of enjoyably torturous running, even if a bit inefficiently.  	103
 Man...that looks unreal   Yeah and it's something that world cricket needed. It's gonna get more competitive now.   Near Delhi University. I think it was Vijag Nagar. The name of the restaurant is "The Roast House". It's near the "Big Yellow Door"  It was a pretty good experience there.    I like the one in British council, but I doubt if this is the best Delhi has to offer.  I tried getting a membership of the Jwahar Lal memorial library, but was denied since they only allow people who are perusing PhD or something       The Bangladesh team have incredible momentum on their side.     Victimhood is power      Desperate times, desperate measures    I often play online chess with a friend of mine who recently started playing. We play these long correspondence games where one gets ample time to move a piece.   I don't know how but suddenly after 2 weeks the guy has improved tremendously. We are in the middle of a game right now and I'm probably going to lose my light squared bishop and it's just going to be very hard to recover from this.  Chess is the only thing I was good at. I've been playing for years and got a 1700-ish rating on some online websites and even won some online tournaments.  Man it's gonna hurt if I lose   I'm 23 years old and although my academic career is pretty okay I have always struggled with my handwriting. People always pointed out that it sucks. Any suggestions?    RSS bhakt Ambani agent trying to disagree with Goras?   Triggered.   I wonder what he thought when Kejri said "it'll be nice if Yogendra and Prashant return to the party."   I don't buy that. 24% is way too low.   	14
                         I couldn't have said it better myself!                                                                                                                                                                       	64
 From left to right please?   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTAAsCNK7RA  The music video won a Grammy in 2007. Well deserved if you ask me.   I was at a dinner party with a few friends one time. It was me, my best friend, a few couples, the hosts family (husband, wife, three kids) and the grand parents. At the end of the day everyone was leaving and the kids were all begging to sleep over at their grandparents house. For whatever reason the dad said no, I forget why. Anyhow, everyone goes home and sleeps off the light beer and appetizers.  The next day I got a call for the host. It was an 'invitation' for his father in law's funeral, the very same one that I had seen at the party last night. Apparently, when the grandparents had gotten home last night there was someone already hiding inside their house waiting for them. He waited until they were asleep to sneak up and stab the grandfather to death. His wife was also stabbed, but she managed to make it outside where a neighbor saw her and was able to help her.  She was taken to the hospital where she was treated for minor injures. While she was there the same man that had broken into their house came strolling through the hospitals front door. In his trial the grandma claimed that as he walked by he stared at her and smiled.  Apparently he had somehow cut himself during the attack, and a neighbor who had no idea what was going on insisted they take him to the hospital. The very hospital the wife of the man he had just murdered was at. Creepy as shit.  He was arrested shortly after being treated, thank god.  **TL;DR A man hid in my friends parent's house and waited for them to go to sleep to murder them. The wife escaped and was taken to the hospital. The attacker soon showed up at the same hospital.**   nbsp;  nbsp;  nbsp;  EDIT: I got one more I wasn't planning on using but decided to anyways.  One week my best friends parents went out of town. It was the first time they ever out of town without him so it was kind of a big deal. We were pretty young, so we didn't throw a party or anything, but we did have an awesome unsupervised sleep over at his house.  I quickly realized I greatly under estimated how scary this would be. His family was rich and he had a **huge** house. Seeing such a big dark empty house was pretty frightening for both of us. We spent most of the night playing video games in the basement.  The next morning when I was getting ready to leave I kept looking for my laptop. I had brought it over to watch a movie we ended up never seeing, but now I couldn't find it. I told my friend I swore I left it on the kitchen table upstairs with the rest of my stuff. My friend decided this was the perfect opportunity to show off a little and show me the security camera terminal his dad had shown him how to use before leaving. I knew he just wanted to brag a little bit that he could even do that, but I figured it might actually help find where I had gone with it. Plus, although I'll never admit it, a security camera terminal sounded really cool and I kinda wanted to see it.  Although there was no camera in his kitchen, the camera nearest clearly showed that I had gone into the room with it (as well as with the rest of my stuff) and came out without it. Naturally, we both assumed the worst. Ghosts. We kept watching though because I insisted that if *I* didn't move it, it must have been *him* that did it some other time that night.  At about two in the morning a man walked past the camera. A very big man with a bat. He came into the shot, looked around for a moment, and then walked into the kitchen. Naturally, we freaked the fuck out. We checked the other cameras for that time. After piecing together the video like a puzzle, we saw that he walked up to every door in the house and tried to open it. The screen door on the side was unlocked. He walked in, and did a preliminary tour of the house. Then he left out the door for a moment, and returned minutes later without the bat. This time he grabbed some stuff from my friend's dad's office, a computer and my laptop. He also took some jewelry, but we didn't find out until later as that was of camera. After collecting his prize, he closed the side door, and left. If my computer hadn't been gone, I would have never known he was there.  I couldn't sleep for weeks after this. A man broke in and robbed the place while I was in the house. That can be pretty god damn traumatic for a kid.  A few years later the police got the guy. I never got my computer back though.  **TL;DR Slept over at my friends house while his parents were away, house was robbed while we were sleeping inside.**   Psh, ones that visit Pluto.   Play golf on the moon three.   "Mmm, that was a tasty sample. Better buy 300."   Shrimp fried rice! Totally!   How would you even know if something was bad if you never knew just how good it could be?   If you don't like Five Guys, you don't like burgers. Simple as that. Five Guys is the most basic that burgers can get.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=st21dIMaGMs   Waffles are not greasy.   Good god that's demoralizing.   Now we just need to figure out where to get the fine China...   Honestly, the only British versions I think arebetter is Top Gear and the singing shows. I've never seen the singing shows, but I have to hope they're at least slightly better.   Wait she doesn't come out?! Well hell, I wish someone had told me that 47 minutes ago...   /r/trees?   The throw at the end is the best part.   **DATE: MONDAY JULY 20, 2015. TIME: 11:12 PM. LOCATION: 1216 E 39th STREET, BROOKLYN, NY 11210 NOTE: FOUND ON PRINTER TRAY.**    nbsp;  nbsp;   nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;Raspberry Snapple has always been my favorite. Not just my favorite iced tea, my favorite drink. No matter where I am, I always have a Raspberry Snapple in hand. My friends constantly make fun of me for it. Raspberry iced tea runs through your veins! they say, One of these days the Snapple factory might need to donate blood for you! I dont mind, I sit back and chuckle with them. Its all in good fun.   nbsp;   nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;My friends have become so accustomed to my habit that they will often have a six pack of Snapple sitting in their fridge waiting for me. My best friend Tom usually has two or three in his. Sometimes Ill catch his girlfriend sneaking one out too. One of us! One of us! I tease. Nicole and I have become good friends over the years. I spend a lot of time hanging out at their apartment. Or at least I used to.   nbsp;   nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;Tom and I had a falling out a few weeks ago. He works as a doctor, a plastic surgeon. He makes good money doing it, not too long ago he moved his office to a brand new building downtown. Its amazing, exotic fish in a tropical tank, expensive paintings on the wall, attractive receptionist behind the desk, the whole nine.   nbsp;   nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;He even offered to get me a job there. Nothing too glamorous, mostly ordering and stocking all of the medicines he needed. I was a little skeptical at first, but then he told me the salary. When can I start? I said eagerly.   nbsp;   nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;The job was pretty easy. He really only needed botox and aesthetics, as well as the occasional new surgical tool. Once I got the hang of the order forms it was a breeze. My day would consist of, asking what Tom he needed, waiting for the 9 AM delivery guy to drop off the new medicines and filling out the forms for the next day, After that all I had was time to kill. Sometimes I would watch the fish swim around, sometimes I would surf the internet on my phone, sometimes I would talk to Allison (the receptionist). It was probably the best job Ive ever had.   nbsp;   nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;One morning I walked in to find Tom waiting for me. He was tapping his foot impatiently as he stood with his arms crossed. What the hell is this? he said handing me a small medicine bottle.   nbsp;   nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;I read the label. Tretinoin I said rather puzzled, Why?   nbsp;   nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;Well? Where is the rest of it?   nbsp;   nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;The rest of it?   nbsp;   nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;Yes, the rest of it! He said angrily, I have an operation in three hours and this is all that was in the medicine storage. Where is the rest of the Tretinoin?!   nbsp;   nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;Confused, I grabbed the order form off of my desk. Tretinoin, Tretinoin, Tretinoin-ah, there it is. Tretinoin, eight bottles   nbsp;   nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;Eight bottles? No, no, no this was the only one in there. You didnt order eight bottles, you ordered one! His voice was getting louder and louder. Allison politely pretended not to notice from behind her desk. "I can't operate if I don't have the first three days of their prescription ready for them! I'm going to have to cancel, and it's on you!"   nbsp;   nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;I shook my head, There must have been some mistake, I ordered eight. Look, it says it right here on the form. Eight. If we only got one it must be on manufacturing or shippings end. I didnt-   nbsp;   nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;I dont want to hear excuses, this is *your* job! If you cant handle it Ill have to find someone who can!   nbsp;   nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;I was shocked. I couldnt believe he would shout at me like that. We were friends, best friends. Was it even that important? We had lenty of medicines could be substituted for trentinoin, I should know I ordered them myself. No, this was ridiculous, I didnt have to take this from him. Not from Tom. Fuck this I said quietly as I turned and grabbed my coat. I thought you were a better friend than that   nbsp;   nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;He wasnt impressed. Dont bother coming back tomorrow! he shouted as I walked out the door, Dont bother coming back ever!   nbsp;   nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;I didnt hear from him in the following weeks. Although I still hung out with Nicole, I always made sure he wasnt around when I was. He must have known what was going on as he saw the number of Snapple bottles in their fridge dwindle, but he never made an effort to reach out or say anything. I didnt mind. At some level it was satisfying to know he was aware I was spending time at his house but couldnt say anything about it.   nbsp;   nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;Me and Nicole ended up spending more and more time together now that my time was freed up not hanging out with Tom. We stopped spending time at their apartment so much, I think he was finally getting frustrated enough to say something about it to her. Instead we went to the movies, to the mall, even to my shitty apartment sometimes. It became a routine. Every time she finished work we would meet up in a bar at the mall for a drink, then go window shopping past all the trending stores, then go back to my place. It was great. It was like I had lost a best friend, but immediately found a new one.   nbsp;   nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;At least I thought she was a friend. She started texting me things that suggest she might have wanted to be a bit more than that. I didnt dwell on it too much, she had been in a committed relationship for a few years now after all. Every now and then though it made me stop and think. The hints slowly became more frequent and more serious. Things like, Why am I even with Tom? I spend more time u anyways lol and I wish I was single when I met you. I always responded with something light like, lol whatever you say or something. What else could I say?   nbsp;   nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;One day Nicole stopped at my house unannounced and bluntly laid out. She said she didnt want to just be friends, she wanted us to be together. At first I was completely against it. Tom is my friend I would say, I cant do that to him   nbsp;   nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;She kind of laughed at that. You think youre friends? You havent seen him in months, we sneak around so you two never have to make contact and youre worried about his feelings?!   nbsp;   nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;That made me think. Were still best friends? Were we still even friends? No, how could we be? I havent seen him in months...he didnt even care enough to say anything when I was in his fucking house. Why should I let some asshole who fired his best friend decided how I live my life? No, fuck that. Its *my* life.   nbsp;   nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;Me and Nicole started dating soon after that. She said a few times that she was going to end it with Tom if things between us got serious, but she wanted to make sure it was the real thing before burning any bridges. I understood that I guess. I mean it was sleazy, but I get it.   nbsp;   nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;Over time I started feeling guilty about it. She tried to comfort me saying things like, Weve been drifting apart for a while now but it didnt help. I decided to end things, or at least put them on hold until they figured out how things were going to be between  in the long term. Blah, I hate this drama shit.   nbsp;   nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;I went by their apartment to end things for now. I knocked on the door. No answer. I knocked again. Nothing. Eventually I heard the locks turn and the door slowly opened. Nicole was standing there in tears. Behind her glass plates laid broken across the floor and a mirror rested smashed in against the wall. He found out she said in between tears, he read my texts   nbsp;   nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;I tried to comfort her. I suggested that we take a break to give her and Tom a chance to figure things out, but she didnt want me to leave. She didnt feel safe around him anymore. She told me that after he had found out he went crazy and started breaking and throwing things. He tried to go after Nicole too, but she locked herself in the bathroom. He said he was going to kill you she said still crying He said he was going to find you, and he was going to kill you I brushed it off but she felt she needed to warn me. Nicole looked me dead in the eyes, he said hes going to find you, and hes going to kill you   nbsp;   nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;Eventually I calmed her down and drove her to her brothers house. I wasnt sure if I should to to the police or what. I decided I should just go home for now. Let things simmer down a little.   nbsp;   nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;As soon as I walked in the front door my phone started ringing. Tom the screen read. I was a little shocked, this was the first I was hearing from him in what seemed like forever. I answered.   nbsp;   nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;Tom, listen I-   nbsp;   nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;Did you take the Snapple?! his shout cut me off mid sentence.   nbsp;   nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;I was lost. The Snapple?...   nbsp;   nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;In the fridge-my fridge-the raspberry Snapple, did you take it? Did you drink it?   nbsp;   nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;I looked down at the half empty body of iced tea in my other hand. ...Yeah, I did. Im sorry, I thought you knew I was at your apartment   nbsp;   nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;There was a brief pause. SHIT! he yelled at the top of his lungs, Shit, Im sorry. Im so sorry man, Im so sorry. I was caught up...I'm so sorry...   nbsp;   nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;What the hell is going on, dude?...   nbsp;   nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;Im so sorry, Im so so sorry he kept saying over and over.   nbsp;   nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;Whats going on! What are you sorry about??   nbsp;   nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;He was silent for a moment, it seemed like he was almost on the edge of holding back tears the tea I...I put a bottle of Botulinum in the raspberry iced tea   nbsp;   nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;That didnt mean anything to me. Botulinum was something I was used to ordering for him, I think he used it in botox operations. His desperation scared me though. I panicked and ran over to my computer so fast that I tripped over my own feet. I quickly Googled botulinum Snapple. Nothing. botulinum iced tea? Nope. I tried just botulinum. Woah. I clicked the first link and read. As I read a chill raced down my spine. I completely involuntarily dropped the phone. This couldnt be happening I read it again, and again. ***The Botulinum toxin causes Botulism, a fatal condition if not treated immediately upon ingestion. It involves muscle paralysis, eventually leading to the paralysis of the respiratory system and, consequently, death in a matter of hours*** For the first time I realized I couldnt feel my feet. I looked down at them. My right foot was awkwardly bent to the side, it actually looked rather painful, but I couldnt feel it. A horrifying realization rushed over me as I tried to move my foot and watched as...as nothing happened. It didnt budge an inch.   nbsp;   nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;No no no this couldnt be happening! I tried to get up, nothing moved. My knees wouldnt move! I couldnt get out of the chair! I tried again. I tried so hard to get just twitch out of my leg, anything, but it wouldn't move. No! I twisted my stomach and reached for the phone I had dropped on the floor. It was too far, I couldnt get it! Shit! No! **REACH FOR IT!** I tried again. With every bit of energy I had I reached and stretched as far as I could. Nothing. I didnt even brush the top of it.   nbsp;   nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;I sat there completely defeated. I didnt want to believe this was happening. There must be something, some way to stop it! I yelled at the top of my lungs over and over again, hoping someone would hear me. Eventually I stopped myself. What was my endgame if they heard me? What could they do to help me? I was too far gone by now. There is no saving me.   nbsp;   nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;There is no experience in this world more terrifying than watching yourself die. Watching what's left of the life inside you slowly wither away and being utterly helpless to stop it. I can feel the numbness slowly moving up my body. Its passing my stomach as I type. I think its even beginning at the end of my fingertips. Soon Ill have nothing. What happens then? Will my heart stop beating when it gets to my chest? Will I sit here unable to stop watching my computer until it all ends? This could very well be the last sight Ill ever see.   nbsp;   nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;The suspense is very literally killing me. I have never known a horror as terrible as this. Im considering finishing the bottle of raspberry iced tea sitting on the table next to me. Will it end this faster? Will it finish the job, and put an end to the doubts I still have? I have so many questions I dont want to have answered, and yet I know Ill have those answers in a few short hours. Or will it be minutes? Or days? I wish I didnt have to find out, but I know I will.   nbsp;   nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;Only time will tell.   MIL?   Aren't puppies fun and playful and adorable too though?   I don't necessarily disagree, but aren't cats fluffy too?   I never realized it would have to be 'Big Hero 6 2'. You'd think the marketing department would have changed that.   Baymax V. Baymax 2016?!   Nailed it.   I know this is long, but I think it's worth it.  Me and a friend used to do some yard work at a neighbors house for some extra money. A family of four owned the house, mom, dad, young son, younger daughter. Each time we went there we would ring the doorbell so they could start the clock and ring it again when we left so they could stop it. One time we got there and the dad opened the door wearing boxers and a tee shirt. He was out of breath too... We joked about it, but he was a pretty weird guy so we didn't think much about it.  When we left we rang the door again and exactly like the last time he answers the door. Half naked and catching his breath. He hadn't paid us this week and promised to, so he went into another room to get his wallet. Suddenly there was a scream, then another and the wife, who had apparently just gotten home, ran past the door shouting. Then the babysitter ran by. Unlike the husband or the wife, she wasn't wearing anything. Suddenly it all made sense, the babysitters car was always there even when the kids weren't.  A very intense argument began and somehow made its way onto the front porch. We would have turned and ran, but the dad insisted we "hold on just a sec" so he could pay us. He kept saying things to and about us in attempt to take himself out of the spotlight. To make it even weirder, the dad and babysitter didn't feel inclined to put on more clothes before stepping out onto the porch. She was actually very attractive, but even sixteen year old me just wanted to get out of there. Out of anger, the mom stepped back inside, closed the door and locked it. Still naked, the two others shouted and pounded on the door for her to open it. A few neighbors heard. I know at least one called the cops but I didn't stay long enough for them to arrive. We waited there at the edge of the porch for ten minutes while the dad repeated over and over again "just let me get my wallet so I can pay the boys". She never did, and to this day neither of us have gone back for the $30 they still owe us.  **TL;DR Wife caught husband cheating with babysitter while me and a friend were at their house, they got locked out on the front porch next to us without their clothes.**   Yeah but...for Father's Day...   That we will win!   You're right, I hate when things like the laws of physics change. Then I have to get used to a whole new laws of physics.   What an...inappropriate Father's Day gift...   Just going up to someones front door just to see if they want to hang out. Not like a random person, a good friend's house though. Apparently that's 'weird' now. I was a little sad to learn that.   It feels weird that there used to be 'smoking' and 'non smoking' sections in restaurants. That sounds like something my grandparents would say when talking about the olden days.   Give myself a hell of a salary, retire on pay day, let the next guy actually run things.   Could have been worse. Could have been a bunch of chili powder.   No way...   But, but, but pants are not required for a sexual encounter... Opportunity squandered!   The only reason I doubt this a little is because even in such a perfect situation to say that, I would **never** say that to the parent of someone I just broke up with. That just...rude? Excessively rude? Something like that. Also that term hasn't been around for all that long. That would make you still pretty young, right?   Personally, I hate Family Guy but love BoJack. I would give it more of a chance if I were you. I mean every animated cartoon has an amount of stupid, even South Park, but that doesn't necessarily make it good or bad.   Probably not. I mean I'm not going to judge you either way, I don't know the details or anything.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aF_Ijr621tM   Certainly not a law, in fact there's about a 50-50 chance that's *not* what would happen. Everything is theoretical, we can't prove any of it. Or at least not yet.   Spegetification!   I'm in college but I'm not studying physics. Just a course I took, although I do find it more than interesting enough to research in my spare time.   Is...is that what you got from it?   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgNDao7m41M   Every time I talk about rogue black holes, that is the biggest obstacle. [To put it to bed though] (https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant rlz=1C1CHFX_enUS536US536 ion=1 espv=2 ie=UTF-8#q=rogue%20black%20holes).   I would even understand it a month into a relationship. And I assume you even knew her before that too. It's more people who just meet and decide this must be what love is. It really cheapens the term.   Ah, thanks I'm not so familiar with the term.   The opposite, if I was single I would never be able to come up with such a complete list...   It's more when people who are fat are now content with it because being curvey has become popular. They act like they have a perfect figure because they qualify as 'curvey'. I've even heard a rather fat lady once tell an extremely fit person they should work on getting more curves instead of working on 'silly things like abs'. I really dislike that kind of attitude. It gives those that don't care about their health a reason to care even less, and discourages those who do from staying healthy. I'm not saying I am that fit a person myself, but I would never say anything like, "you would look better if you stopped going to the gym and got some more curves".   Sorry, what I meant is it would *be* longer but not *seem* longer.   Actually they already made that one. It's called 'Teeth'.   You've never seen BoJack Horseman.   Ohh, even better.   When people comment on comments commenting about people commenting on their own comments.   For a second I thought you got it in the Amazon. I didn't question it, that seemed to make sense.   When people comment on their own comments   Taken...and also Taken 2.   "Fish in a Barrel" working title   Whaaaaat? Mr. Peanutbutter and BoJack Horseman in the same restaurant? Is this a crossover episode?   But he's the best god damn not an animator the world has ever seen.   You are a liar, final answer.   Don't look down.   Anddd I'll be sleeping with the lights on tonight.   Yu-Gi-Oh cards. The best part about it was no one knew how to play the game, we just had an irrational want for the cards.   What does that have to do with expecting the wold to change on my behalf?   That makes sense I guess, I live in an unreasonably cold area.   * Jaws  * Die Hard  * The Young and the Restless  * Holes  * How I Met Your Mother (my personal favorite)  * Get Hard  * VHS  * Sex Drive  * Two and a Half Men  * The Big Lebowski  * Men in Black  andddd  * Game of Thrones  EDIT: Oops, thought it was TV shows too.   Although better for the car, that's a little impractical. You can't give the car three minutes to catch up every time you start the engine.   "I love you" is thrown around way too loosely these days. I've seen college/high school kids saying that almost immediately after they start dating. Excuse me, you're in love? You didn't even know them a week ago...   /r/space is awesome. There are also a lot of Youtube videos that can be very interesting regarding space or black holes. Search something like 'space time' or 'black holes' and I'm sure you'll find something. [This one] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgNDao7m41M) is one of my favorites, very insightful.  If you're really committed there are also plenty of books on the subject. Stephen Hawking is probably one of the best authors out there right now, he goes on much further than just black holes though.  Even TV shows like Nova sometimes talk about black holes. Although I would agree Googleing it probably isn't the best method, there are still plenty of sources out there. Good luck!   The world isn't going to change? Why did you think I expected anything to change? The question asked what I found annoying, I answered.   Good god, that would be a truly horrifying person.    I guess it just depends on how often it's said. I'd say the maximum limit to a phrase like that is about once per conversation before it really becomes noticeable.   * Pants that go up past the belly button  * Constantly checking phone, even in the middle of conversations  * When people who are fat act like they are in their physical prime because they have 'curves'  * 'Emo' hair, makeup and clothing styles. That trend is more than dead.  * Must take a picture of every. Single. Thing.  * Talking about how fat/ugly they are, regardless of weather or not it's true  * Highlighter hair colors  * Choker necklaces. Not exactly sure if that's what it's called.  * Too many piercings   * Fake nails exceeding an inch in length  * Rather take pictures/videos of concerts and sporting events than enjoying them  * Thinking they're a good singer, and singing often because of it  * 'Too cool for this' attitude  * Asking me to like their Instagram or retweet them  * Half of texting vocabulary made of up emojis  * Constant gossip  * Diet exclusively made up of Nutella, coffee and trendy foods like quinoa. Only talk about those things.  * Being mad but not being direct about it, and then getting madder that no one noticed  * Way too much makeup  * Getting mad when I respond to a text with less than three words  * Dramatically over dressing for minor occasions  * "I'm a vegetarian but I eat fish because they're not animals" actual quote  * Hating every other girl that is remotely attractive  * Thinking it's okay to tell everyone everything about everyone else  * Constant talking about male celebrity crushes, getting mad when a guy references a female  * Tattoos that cover as much as the entire neck  * Holding grudges for way too long  * Entitlement  * Rant about gender equality, get mad when I ask if we should split the bill then (just an example)  * Expectations that life is like a romantic comedy  * Overly tan, skin cancer is in this year  * Thinking their unique sense of style is working (Such as wearing overalls)  * Micro thin eyebrows  * Overusing terms like 'bae', 'I can't even', 'the struggle' and 'fleek'  * Worshiping Starbucks and 'Dunkin'  * Not getting a job, coasting off others   EDIT: Obviously this doesn't apply to anywhere near everyone, many probably apply to both genders too.  EDIT 2: I'm not referring to any one person, just things I notice seem to be becoming slightly common in the social world today.  EDIT 3: Reworded the 'curvey' thing. That is more what I meant.   A classic.   I love that one.   I've kind of seen it too many times for it to still be funny to me, but [this] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F9jXYOH2c0) used to be mine.   Bojack Horseman.  I really love how the jokes continue on through the show instead of just being around for one episode (Hollywoo, Halloween store in July store, etc.). I hate when they do that in sitcoms.   A very good joke, but far far from the best.   No, but it's easier to understand worded that way.   Well, the singularity, the center of the black hole, theoretically is a point of infinite gravity. It's called that because there is simply no other way to explain it, although it's all theoretical.  Since the singularity would by definition have to be the same on every black hole, they wouldn't have to have the same gravitational pull all together, but they would be the same at the center. That's because the singularity is as small and as dense as it gets, there is no difference from black hole to black hole.  The size varies because although the singularity of black holes are all the same, the mass is not. And the gravitational pull does not extend at the same strength across the universe. It is lowered exponentially until there is almost no pull at all. Thats why not everything would be sucked into one black hole.   Any other pictures?   ...where the fuck did they test this?   Sadly, no. Although that would make an awesome science fiction movie. The only way to make a black hole would be to crush an object below its Schwarzschild radius. The ratio between normal size and Schwartzchild radius is so ridiculously big that us humans could never hope to reach it (not yet anyways). Just as an example, the Schwarzchild radius for an object the size of Earth would be about as large as a peanut. It would be impossible for us to crush anything that small.  But assuming we could make a black hole, we would have to feed it things until it obtained enough mass to become larger than the oncoming black hole. That again is a problem. We could of course throw in the planets of the solar system, but that probably wouldn't be enough. The rouge black hole has probably swallowed up much more than a few planets, maybe even a few stars, it's likely much much larger than any other black hole we could conceivably make.  If well placed enough however, we could probably use a black hole with enough mass to divert an oncoming black hole from it's collision course. The gravitational pull would at least alter its path slightly, wich could be enough.  All in all though, no that's not really an option.   Yeah sorry, I did this on my phone.   Yes, that's the one. I know where it is, no one ever seems to use it though. Even when I get letters from the government they always have the sloppy right orientation on.   That thing on Microsoft Word where the lines fill out the whole page instead of just stopping at a jagged edge on the side of paper. It looks so much more professional, but no one knows to do it.   I [just went on for about twenty minutes about black holes and the universe] (https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/3dsllj/what_is_the_weirdestscariest_most/ct8g29u), and I could go on for hours more. In my humble opinion, it is by far the most interesting topic of discussion out there, or at least within the top five.   Black holes are crazy. Basically if you can crush something small enough, it can create a point if infinite gravity and density. Not only that, but it could potentially create a bend in time space so dramatic that it connects two parts of the universe millions of light years away. Even the laws of physics are at the mercy of black holes. A black hole could slow time itself!  There are even theories that black holes contain stars, planets-even galaxies-within them. When something is sucked into a black hole, like say a star, it is compressed into the black holes center where it will stay forever. Eventually more stars get sucked in adding to the collection and creating a star system, and even a galaxy! And what would happen if one of those stars went supernova? It could potentially create another black hole, with another galaxy inside of it, with another black hole within that! Theoretically, we could be living in a black hole inside of another black hole inside of another.  Some theories are far more sinister though. Some believe that getting close enough to a black hole will start a process called 'spegitification'. Spegetification is the stretching of an object so far that eventually every atom that made up the object will be layed out in a single file line.  As you are standing right now, or probably sitting, your feet are experiencing stronger gravity than your head because it is closer to the source of the gravity (the central Earth). The same thing happens in a black hole but to a much much larger scale. So much larger in fact that if you were to go into a black hole feet first, you would be stretched out with your feet stretching further than your head because they are under more gravitational strain. Spaghettification. Eventually you would be stretched out soooo far that what used to be your body would now be that single file line of atoms. In theory, they would keep spreading apart until they reached the singularity, the center of the black hole.  And then there are rogue black holes (yes that's how you spell it, no it's not the color. I think the Bitish spelling is different, that can cause a little confusion). Rogue black holes are black holes that don't have a fixed position and instead wanted aimlessly thought the galaxy. It's pretty scary when you think about it, there is literally nothing that could stop a rogue back hole and it could swallow you up in a matter of seconds (although it would seem considerably longer than that for the person being sucked in). At any moment, the Earth-hell, the entire solar system-could be destroyed by a black hole moving by at near the speed of light. It's unlikely anyone would even see it coming, although the methods for finding rouge black holes are getting better they're far from perfect. At every moment, the threat of spetification could be looming around the corner, but we can never know for sure.  Honestly though, I'm not sure I'd even want to know if one was coming towards us. There is literally nothing that can be done to stop it or get out of the way, might as well cross our fingers and go on with the day.  The science of how black holes could connect different parts of the universe is also fascinating. Space time is a physics and mathematical term combing both space and time in a single continuum (sometimes referred to as the 'space-time continuum'). It can be visualized as a flat plane, think of it as a table cloth with the ends held up to keep it straight and flat. If there was nothing in the universe, this is what space time would look like. Gravity bends time space though. Things like planets, stars and black holes cause bends in space time. Imagine that there was a few marbled dropped on the table cloth. The marbles represent planets, or stars, or anything holding mass and therefore gravity. Each marble bends down a small portion of the table cloth surrounding it, creating a crater. The areas of the craters slope that are bent the most have the strongest gravity, while the areas that are relatively flat have less. If the marbles move, their 'gravitational craters' move with them. Space time is filled with bends throught it.  Many believe space time isn't *just* flat though. They think it is more the shape of a cylinder. Imagine that two ends of the table cloth have now been joined creating a circle. The marbles are still bending the cloth inwards, but it is shaped more like an 'O' now. To represent areas of ridiculously high gravity (such as black holes) we can't use marbles, they're simply too small. Instead, lets drop a bowling ball right on top of the table cloth amidst all the other marbles. The bowling ball is so heavy that instead of just bending the table cloth a little, it stretches it all the way down until it is touching the cloth on the other side of the circle. It is so strong that it connected two points extremely far away from one another directly through the middle. Black holes extreme gravity could very well connect points in our universe the same way.  That means that if we could somehow survive the journey into a black hole, and then escape out the other side, we could come out trillions upon millions of light years away on the other side of the universe. This is what is known as a wormhole, or an Einstein-Rosen Bridge.  Absolutely insane stuff, and I've really just scratched the surface here on the basics of black holes. There is so much more I didn't go on about, so much more than that that's miles over my head and so much more than that we don't even know yet.  **TL;DR Black holes are fucking insane.**  EDIT: Just realized my phone changed everything from 'space time' to 'time space'. I'll try to fix that.   Gracias!   No, I understand how Reddit works. It's a good fact, it deserves be higher up in the comments.   Can someone please reverse this so it looks like he's moon walking?   Dildo of god. Oh my.   Jesus, what an unfortunate farmer.   I think the Dutch are just trying to pull a fast one. "This is called a carrot, it used to be blue. You're just going to have to trust me on that one."   For science.   Highway 11 just didn't have the same ring.   Holy shit, this should be higher up.   Sorry, but I'm gonna one up your Aztec fact a little bit. Did you know, that Oxford University is older than the Aztec civilization? Crazy.   "To battle, you god damn motherfuckers!"  -Polly   I'd love to go on a boat trip one day and see a Great White float on by, belly side up.   I like facts like this. Oxford University is older than the Aztecs. How crazy is that?   "Oh yeah, I uh, grew a beard and aged ten years and lost my accent. Adult onset puberty."   It says 'gold shall be their shrouds'. The prophecy seems to go in order, I think Tomen died before she's killed. Maybe that's even why she's crying when she's killed.   In my humble opinion, Mergery is the 'younger and more beautiful'. Cersi was the queen until she came along, now she has to give up everything to her. Even her precious Tomen.  Her children's hair are 'gold'. I don't think it means literal crowns, unless Marcella is somehow made a queen. Apparently they'll all die to, probably before her considering how the prophecy seems to go in order. Watch your back, Tomen...  It says she'll die when her tears have drowned her. Tears for the death of someone perhaps? Such as Marcella? Or Tomen? Maybe both. It also says '*the* valonqar', not '*your* valonqar'. That makes it seem like it really isn't one of her brothers. It would also be difficult for them to be the killer considering Jamie doesn't have hand*s* and Tyrion is half a world away. Who does that leave? Sandor obviously, not sure if that's realistic or not. I'm not really sure who else. Could be a new character of course, but I can't imagine her being killed by someone just introduced.  The entire 'valonqar' part wasn't in the prophecy during the flashback in the TV show though. They might do things very differently.   In the books maybe, but they've kind of burned that bridge in the show so I have my doubts. They could of course make a change, but I couldn't imagine such a huge difference. GRRM is an executive producer after all.  Brienne don't even really fit the prophecy. She's not more beautiful than Cersi, they've definitely established that through both the books and the show. I'm not sure which of them is younger though, they seem to be about the same age? Either way, it doesn't fit for her.

    thatstheyoke   I have medical bills from last year that amount to roughly $1000 dollars. I was an idiot, and let them get into collections.   The same collection agency is dealing with three different amounts, and I received the letters about four months ago.   I'm now cleaning my credit up, and ran TransUnion and Equifax credit reports, which are not reporting the accounts at all.  **Question:**  I would like to pay up to half of this right now, and pay the rest off in installments. Should I call up the collections agency and just do it, or should I try to receive some sort of writing first that it won't be reported on my credit report?  Thanks!   Maybe mashed potatoes?

The author is changing the license of the code, however, so soon, it will be.  He can re-release the code under a new license, but it doesn't change the fact that the old repo was forked and modified with the old license.  ~~Ir~~regardless, he does have some pirated ROMs on his site, so the morality of this guy is questionable.  ok, fair. But the roms are being distributed to demonstrate the functionality of the emulator, not being claimed as the authors original work. He shouldn't have them up there, but using possesion of GBA roms as a metric for morality may be a bit too sensitive when dealing with an emulator.    He ~~ripped off this guy....~~ forked this repo: https://github.com/taisel/IodineGBA  FTFY The credit's in the git history. This is the cool thing about public code and something that should be encouraged.    you're just reaping karma gold with this face huh?   anythin we should prepare for or do?  Yeah, prepare to spend a lot of money securing that .com when you finally get in touch with the owner    Now you got me sayin it   I'm on the smaller side.  I slapped this girls ass in the bar in front of her jacked 6'4" boyfriend and started talking shit, got kicked out of the bar after almost getting the shit beat out of me.   Then I proceeded to black out and talk shit to all of my friends and stayed up until eight in the morning.    I want to know what made them!   apparently the /s/ tag is now required in /r/politics   It's pointless to try and sway people who hold /u/gonnaupvote3's type of anecdotally informed belief in this way.    They've simply seen it, and therefore believe it to be true.  I wholeheartly agree with you, but I also sympathize with gonnaupvote3.   ok..  You're reading a technical manual for information, not entertainment. This is the same reason why journalists tend to refrain from using whimsical prose to describe events.  If you'd like to read story books to learn how to operate the linux kernal, fine, but that's not the best way to get the info you need.   More than a bonus podcast! I'm talking straight bonus. I feel like I'm on a friggan game show right now.   I n-n-need more then that! I deserve c-c-c-cash for my time, effort and money. I want my name on the masthead.   ...and no government will ever again be viewed as legitimate.  What?      Was it vital for the survival of human beings? If not, I'd rather we be in the dark for certain subjects...   The problem with that line of reasoning is that the nature of knowledge and information doesn't work linearly. Knowing something new about one thing can open up breakthroughs in unrelated fields.   It's unfortunate, but if we abstained from everything we didn't need we'd be living extremely spartan lifestyles. Cheap clothes, cheap food, cheap energy all come at the expense of unsavory consequences.    You think artists receive a wage of $0/hr?    Was the knowledge gained really worth the tremendous emotional and physical suffering of the rats involved?  yes.   sure thing here's the link:   Another thing that really grinds my gears is re styling the scroll bar. It seems like it has become more popular recently and I hate it.   Seconded for auto prefixer   The library?  Honestly, what are you looking for? Go to wikipedia, read his overview, see what interests you about him and then go to the library and take some books out. Rinse and repeat.      Parasola conopilus  Don't think so, gills aren't the right color. Lbm's are quite difficult to identify. Spore print's would help, but even then, who knows. There's lot's and lot's and lot's of mushrooms that look like this.  edit: all of the colors are a little off, and the cap shape doesn't look quite right either.   I'd love to see some as well   Then shut the fuck up about it   This is nice work   Wheres the link so I can throw my money at you?   I find it really useful to use two screens.   I do work on the go alot, but I prefer mouse / keyboard / extra screen   a) what is it that you don't like about bootstrap?  b) what would you suggest as an alternative?    I use grunt sometimes, but it you have any jetbrains software, you run a task to automatically compile your files.   Sometimes it takes a bit to detect changes so I have it linked to a ctrl-alt-/  Edit: I would be surprised if other ides didn't have the same feature   To be honest, from what you've said it sounds like your boss wants you to take potential employees out after interviewing them, not for you to drink again.  If that's part of your job, so be it. Take them out, pay for their tab and drink coca cola. No big deal, you got this!   Funny, you left out gitmo and the Iraq war and the drone program and the financial crises, the growing concern that leaders are being blatantly bought by millionaires, a troubling stance towards whistle blowers, incredible racial disparity, the NSA spying program....  But no, we have gay marriage and weed. We're just *fine*.    here's a basic breakdown:  Step 1:  use input type='file' multiple to get the users files into the browser  Step 2:  send these files to the server  Step 3:  on the server, use a library like ffmpeg via php, to convert and echo said files.  Step 4:  When the server sends the response, make the file available for the user to download.  That should help get you going   Thanks! I was literally juat going home to start doing this.   ha! got a project TouchMe, for touch events      Thanks for the inspiration, been feeling a bit lost lately.   Well, if they're concatenating and minifying, then they don't really need to be worrying about those comments showing up   That's what I was going for :)    Good to know! I was more thinking along the lines of, "I just woke up and need a coffee before anything else."   Ive been mainly using duolingo, and have read some helpful articles... but what I came up with is this:  Ich brauche einen Tasse Kaffee zu trinken.   So... taupe is bad?

I would also be interested in this   Yeah, it's unfortunate they weren't staring at scrolling screens of green on black text.    It would actually be amazing seeing as I feel that I'm conscious. I wouldn't put it passed a human brain to create sub consciousness in duress, those pesky motherfuckers.   Sorry, im drunk.   This is what comforts me, honestly.    Just imagine all the bravery those reporters could bask in.    No... He looks for work and a career monsters.   Apply to many, many places for a barbacking position. Use friends, friends of friends, family and acquaintances as references and potential leads.  In that position, you'll be working with bartenders. You will be a bitch, doing menial tasks and learning what happens behind a bar. Work hard. Take every shift offered to you. Cover shifts. Be prepared to take criticism. Learn the drinks and the side work of the bar.   In time, you'll start blurring the lines between barback and bartender. Then you'll be able to pick up -- here and there -- bartending shifts. Using that experience, you'll either A) be able to weasel your way into a bartending shift at the place you're at or B) start applying with actual bartending experience to other bars.  Good luck man.   I would go out on a limb and say this:.  They got the TBS deal. It's not hard to imagine, given TBS' s track record for realising potential. J   A have an excellent portfolio. The Twitter campaign was planned to garner support, awareness and viewers for the upcoming show.   They split with college humor because they might be a) already shooting episodes,  or b) because of conflict of interest / a very busy schedule of writing and shooting the upcoming show.   That's my guess anyway...   Just an example, this was 15 years ago.   I've always had to setup an iptables firewall with rackspace stuff  Me too. But that's like one of my first steps when dealing with a new server regardless... why anybody wouldnt care to look at it boggles my mind.     An honest question:  It's awesome that facebook would pay for and appreciates this kind of exploit reporting... but is what he did technically illegal?   I know somebody from highschool who found major exploits in the school's network, documented  and then reported them to IT to try to get a job for his senior year.  The IT department head (It was made up of like two/three people) responded by reporting him to the police and he ended up beibg expelled. I'm not really sure what happened to him legally,  but I know it kind of fucked his life up for a bit.   Looks like someone tried to take this thread into dvote heaven.

If you want to switch back and forth, then IFTTT is a great solution for syncing saved articles.   Even if you're not able to transfer your saved articles from Feedly, you should give Inoreader a go. It's a very powerful reader with great features (much better than Feedly) ;).   Since this is a subreddit about Inoreader, maybe you should ask for help from Feedly or from their communities :).  My only solution for transferring saved items from Feedly to Inoreader is IFTTT. But this will work only for new items, not for previous saved ones.         First things first.

 That wasn't the question though   They did hire all those swordsmen and parkour professionals   I would think that Furious 7 and Rogue Nation (as well as Star Wars and Spectre I guess) all stand a chance - heck, 3 of those movies haven't even come out yet, but from what we've seen they seem like likely candidates.   Not a sequel, spinoff, remake, reboot, adaptation, or based on any historical event/person.   Yeah but I think the security around those movies is very different   Argo!   What?   That's not melodramatic at all, jut bad writing - I don't think those lines were intended to pull at your emotions.   Kubrick's or Lean's Lord of the Rings   A long, long, time ago...   If you're being realistic, then I don't know why you think there's any way it would leak 2 WEEKS before!   The rumor is actually that George didn't have enough money in his ink fund to print the extra letter on all the merchandise and posters    WHATS WRONG WITH YOUR FAAACCCCEEEE   That starts with Doc Brown's lab and Marty walking in    Is it midnight on September 3rd (very very earlier on the 4th I guess) or is it midnight on the 4th when they come out?   Exactly, but you talked about it like everyone on /r/movies was wrong and your opinion was the right one.   Yeah but mostly everyone else thought it was great - you're taking what's considered an above average movie and calling it decent, not the other way around.   That's what I thought originally too   That just confirmed a Star Wars presence, not The Force Awakens specifically.    Eh, it's still a possibility.   Dude is 84, older than Nimoy was when he died..,   Yeah but Iwata had health problems   It's delicious, and you should try it   50 miles from Sonic   I've never heard of it! Some sort of gem, perhaps? Is it underrated?   I think there was, but Kasdan is usually able to handle characters well.   I would argue that Palpatine is the main villain of the PT - he's not present as much as Vader is in terms of actively terrorizing our heroes, but he's the one pulling all the strings.  I think each of the TFA villains will mirror an OT one-  Hux - Tarkin Phasma - Boba Fett Kylo Ren - Vader Smoke - The Emporer   That's not an Imagineer dude   It still was the same thing in both trilogies if you think about it:  Overall villain: Palpatine  Episode 1 villain: Maul Episode 2 villain: Dooku Episode 3 villain: Grevious partially, but more Palpatine   Overall villain: Vader  Episode 4 villain: Tarkin Episode 5 villain: Vader (at his strongest point) Episode 6 villain: Palpatine (Vader is redeemed)   Poster - a teaser (especially one that short) has very little value once the actual movie is released. A poster is a piece of art that we can admire forever.   I hope these conversations are included as part of the "making of" book for TFA   "I... Uh... Find a way.... TO KILL YOU!"   It also fits with Creed, with the rumors that Rocky is diagnosed with cancer.   Is it just me or does Chevy Chase look like a heavier Larry David?   Jaws had POV shark shots and if anything that added to the suspense   I feel like BvS will try to cram too much stuff in, just for the sake of getting ready for Justice League. With Civil War, they've had like 11 movies to get ready. It also makes a difference that we know the Marvel characters very well, whereas there has only been 1 other DCU movie.   The 3 month old trailer has like 60 million views on the official Star Wars YT channel alone - it broke the record for the most views on a trailer in a 24 hour period.  Have you been living under a rock or something for the last 40 years?   DAE think Star Wars is nerdy? How can it not be? It's not like these movies have made billions of dollars over the years or anything lol who goes to see that???? Ayy lmao!!!!!!!    You mean Office Space?   I have a friend like that - apparently there's no way a movie can be watchable if it was made before modern technology existed.   He thought Back to the Future was cheesy, despite only having seen the first 10 minutes of it.   I think there's a lot about Boyhood that relies on who you are - I thought it was good, but it was far from being my favorite movie of the year. I loved Birdman though.   Beetlejuice.   I think people took it in a negative way   I don't think it's particularly *bad* now (the Season 26 finale was pretty funny), it's just different. It caters to a more modern audience.   You have to admit that if the prequels did one thing well, it was the design of the ships and creatures.   Really? I think that's one of the better episodes actually.   I don't know about that, but I think they have some idea about who the character is.   And the fact that they had to actually paint Kramer's portrait, sculpt fusilli Jerry, etc   I think he probably knows, with all the fan rumors and everything - after all, it was Kasdan who said Darth Vegas, and Abrams was the one who said no to the question.   He's been right about a lot of things. A lot.  Leaked concept art, scene descriptions, character descriptions, trailer descriptions, having access to frames from the actual movie, etc.   Yeah but basically there's no way they can turn a profit on that if everyone who funds the movie essentially gets their money back,   I know it's probably impossible to choose, but I'll go first:  (In no particular order)  The Marine Biologist The Stakeout The Movie The Outing The Conversion   Those are in no way slapstick comedy movies. They are smart, well written movies with good humor - basically what Star Trek is.   "If you write this, I'll let you have a part in Star Wars!"   They could write it in as a plot element in 8 or 9   Apple or iOS?   The Grand Bondapest Hotel   Er... It was nominated for 8 Oscars and won 1, and the New York Times film critic said it was "far and away the most surprising and cinematically exciting motion picture to be seen here in many a moon. "   Steven Spielberg: I would say any of his films from the late 70s and early 80s (Jaws, Close Encounters, Raiders, E.T.), and then slowly transition into his more dramatic works (Schindler's List, Munich, Lincoln)   These arrows are making me thirsty!   Universally panned but it won 2 Oscars and was nominated for best picture?   Yeah I'd say if is   Very true    Not anywhere close - Star Wars is Star Wars, and BvS is an average looking sequel to a decent movie that came out only 2 years ago - there's a big difference.   Bridge of Spies? Steve Jobs maybe?   *These* PRENTZELS... Are making *me* THIRSTY!   Actually curvy TVs seem to be coming back around   K   Whatever dude   By routinely you mean from that other thread once? After you looked in my post history?   Sorry I didn't see what you were replying to   It's a character from a comedic review, not someone's actual voice.   Star Wars, James Bond, Mission Impossible, MCU, Pixar movies, X-Men, Pirates of the Carribean...   Honestly? I think Michael Bay is a pretty good director, but a lot of his movies are badly written.   Yeah but you answered your rhetorical question, which isn't something you're supposed to do...   To the majority of people, that's probably not true.   I'm not saying it is, but it's not nearly as bad as Rise of the Silver Surfer.   The Phantom Menace still had a lot going for it - great special effects, a few good performances, and it was the first Star Wars movie in 16 years, so there's that.   I bought a computer to upvote this   I think that was the actual Soup Nazi, who said that the show ruined his life.   I don't think so - it only uses old footage, and there's really no reason for a TV spot 5 months from release.    Ha I know I was being sarcastic   Full scale, probably.   Keep in mind that they're using real sets, practical effects. It's all real. And did I mention practical effects? The opposite of CGI. Less of that, more of this. And by this I mean practical effects, which I don't think I mentioned earlier. They're real life effects by the way, not done on a computer. It'll look cool. /s   He does in some part of the movie, but in other parts he has the one in [this photo.](http://imgur.com/Y1NEVI1)  (On the left)   I still think it's pretty awesome   X-Wing pilots have always had names like Poe.  "Dak" "Jek" "Wedge" "Biggs"     NBC has nothing to do with Spectre, by the way.  Disney happens to be very protective of their properties, and Jurassic World really isn't the same as Star Wars.   You really think that looks anything like Greg Grunberg?   Knowing the release date of an anticipated film is nerdy?   Yeah I remember the days when Lego used to be one of the most popular toy brands...  Oh wait   ...   Not really... It's probably the most popular franchise ever, and it's made more than 30 billion dollars from all the sales of Star Wars merchandise. That's not something a nerdy movie is able to accomplish easily...   Basically no indie movie has any chance of making money next year.  Star Wars, BvS, Civil War, X-Men, Suicide Squad, Independence Day, Finding Dory, Warcraft, Star Trek, Ice Age, Ghostbusters, Borne, Gambit, Doctor Strange, Fantastic Beasts, Assassin's Creed, and Star Wars again....     Me too! High five!   But if this movie is out, Star Wars will be out. And Star Wars isn't really that nerdy of a movie, either.   /r/lewronggeneration /r/lewronggeneration /r/lewronggeneration /r/lewronggeneration /r/lewronggeneration /r/lewronggeneration /r/lewronggeneration /r/lewronggeneration /r/lewronggeneration /r/lewronggeneration  /r/lewronggeneration /r/lewronggeneration /r/lewronggeneration /r/lewronggeneration      ayy lmao   In what sense? I have seen it.   Are you seriously calling Fury Road an auteur film?   Affleck one his Oscar for Good Will Hunting, not The Town.   Mad Max is just as much a risk as Furious 7 is. It's still a sequel, and it's an action movie. That appeals to a lot of people.  And nowadays the standard budget for most major studio films is somewhere around 100 million, and if the studio really didn't have confidence in those projects, they wouldn't have greenlit them. Only a few of those examples flopped, most were financial or critical successes.   Suicide Squad takes place before BvS - Batman is in it, and the Joker is in it. In the latest BvS trailer, we see Robin's suit with presumably the Joker's handwriting on it. I doubt they'd take the time to tell this story in that movie, so it's more likely that they would wait for Suicide Squad - or possibly Affleck's solo Batman movie.   I definitely wouldn't call any of those projects risks particularly.  Nolan and Cuaron are critically acclaimed directors, Affleck is an Oscar winner, and the Wachowskis have made many successful projects in the past.   Those are not risks. Most of those projects payed off, and it wasn't expected that they wouldn't.  It would be risky to throw 200 million dollars at a director who's only directed 1 feature film - and Universal are the ones that did that  with Jurassic World, not WB.   Kids today will never know about The Suite Life of Zack and Cody and the Nintendo DS?   Both of those were products of the mid-2000s...      No, it was the content that hurt it, not the rating. If it still had the same content but an R rating, why would that be any different? *Less* people would see it.   I guess so, but that doesn't make it any less true       Sorry!   It's classified as a rock in the same way that Mars is classified as a rock - Pluto is just a dwarf planet.   I think that would be way too disrespectful to everyone who put hard work and effort into those movies...   Kasdan is writing it as well, so I don't think it will be   First of all, Plinkett elaborated as to why that shot didn't work in comparison to the opening shot of A New Hope.  Second, there's no way Roger Ebert gave TPM 4 and 1/2 stars because his rating only goes up to 4 - it was 3 and 1/2 stars.  And third - there was tons of effort put into the prequels by the actors and most of the crew, but George Lucas is not a good director. Watch the interview Ewan McGregor did on The Graham Norton show the other week, where he tells a story about how Lucas has a lot of trouble directing characters. He puts visuals above story a lot of the time, which leads to a bad movie.  I could very easily go out and make a crummy movie, and say that it's a homage to bad movies like Howard the Duck and Jaws 4, but that doesn't justify it being bad.   Oh yeah, like all those speeches from Obama where he constantly says that ISIS is a problem that needs to be stopped?   Yeah, but it's not Tommy Wiseau cringe-bad  	113
 Older:  Ask The Dust by John Fante.  He ws a fantastic writer, way ahead of his time, and he became masterful in time, but the ending to Ask The Dust was so melodramatic and ridiculously angsty.  Newer:  Not that big of a fan, but The Hunger Games.  I don't believe the government's actions were that far-fetched as brutal regimes have done worse on people and their children over the course of history, but even if little teenage tough-gal became the poster-woman of a revolution, it's hard for me to believe that she wouldn't quickly be swept aside as propoganda in lou of more experienced leaders, mercenaries and so forth.  Sure, she's there for moral support, but I'd hope these hardened workers turned soldiers could carry on even if they didn't have a teenage girl as their mascot.   Yes.  Please fungineer my imagination and view of the world for me!  Make me believe!!!!!!!  (haha, sorry, it's just, the made up term 'imagineer' has always sort of had a totalitarian and slightly creepy vibe to me :)     It's hard to sometimes separate the artist from the art, but ideally, I can enjoy something, even if the creator of it is a total crab-hammering douche novel.  The short answer is - no, usually I don't let an asshole artist get in the way of enjoying their art - though if it does bother me that much for whatever reason, I try not to support said doucher.   How did it not in turn rip Mr. Plier dude's face off?   That one guy (or girl).  They are virtually on any site, ready to jump down your throat because they made assumptions about whatever it is you are saying or asking about, and without even fully understanding what you are getting at, they unleash a tirade of patronizing, malcontent, hostile bull-shit right in your fucking eyes.  Seriously, fuck you, that one guy.   Was your grandma always an asshole?  Or just Catholic? :P   I like the options notion.  "Welcome to McHeaven, Jesus here, can I please take your order?  For an unlimited time of eternity, if you masturbate you will be burning in hell with Satan.  Are you interested?"  "No thank you.  Can I just have a cheeseburger, and some cool people to hang around with for the rest of forever?"  "Sorry, there are only Jehova's Witnesses up here."  "Shit.  I'll take hell with two extra orders of Satan please."  "Coming right up.  Please pull up to the next cloud to exchange your soul."   Yeah.  Take that, hell-surviving veterans!   Totally.  I want to look at it longer, reach out, touch it, maybe put my hand inside just for a second to see what its like, but in all seriousness man, as an empty internet gesture that many of us do - I wish you the best of luck, good doctors, and keep up your awesome fucking sense of humor.  I hope I can look that bitch death in the eyes with a modicum of your gallow giggles.  Also - you believe in an afterlife?  Or is it ashes to ashes, dust to dust?   Dude!  Where is your spine?!   Why? Lil Wayne's rhymes and raps are like kindergarden compared to Em.  Seriously.  Wayne can't write for shit - it's not even unoriginal, mediocre, def-jam high-school poetry group bad, it's straight out retard bad.  Not tryna be a dick, but I just don't understand D:   LOL.  Exactly.  By the 8th time in a row he rhymes nigga with nigga, my ears are pretty fuckin perked!   About which point? :D     Ok, my apologies for the loose use of words.  It wasn't hijacked.  I think we're still on the same page though:  wanting to have the cake and eat it too, and we fight any perceived sexism, real or imagined, with even bigger sexism, and it's been total shit going on way-too-long now.  I look forward to looking into those you have mentioned.  Thanks again.  edit:clarity and grammar what nots   Thanks.  Will check it out soon.   I agree that history and context are important, hence my questions along these lines.  I'm familiar with some of what you wrote, and some I am not, and you seem to have a good education all this, and I would like to learn more myself.  I appreciate your input, though I see a misunderstanding between us, as I'd disagree with you on saying people haven't hijacked feminism (or any other movement) for their own personal agenda (usually money and power).  I think the key word here is 'outside.'     I never meant it as an outside issue (ie, pepsi cola came in because they thought they could get a bigger market share from women spenders), I just meant those same people drawn to the movement kept it alive, pushing it forward through new mutations, when like you said, it should have gone away.  As for those people making lots of money and fame off this, or at the least trying to get some attention or pussy or an easy ride or whatever, they might use the same platform or alter it any which way to keep pushing it forward, but at the end of the day they are in it for their own selfish reasons and personal gain.     The most dangerous ones are the nutjobs actually believe in what they say, and what disturbs me, is that this seems to be the majority of them, or at least, the most vocal and garish ones, the ones who garner large crowds and attention and influence, and this is the kind of bull-shit that makes the news everyday, and all the "i am trying to bring awareness to gender issues," and usually they mean, "I want people to listen and do as I say, and I want to make a living doing it, and by gender issues, I mean, women, because they are more important than men."  As you said, it isn't about equality, it is about favoring women over men.  Still, I tend to want to over-simplify it as "having their cake and eating it too."  edit:  format   Also - another question for you.  From your experience, as well as any statistics you may have on the subject, how do those issues apply and what does that wind up looking like in the engineering field?  Are they paid less?  Taken less seriously, etc?  Thank sin advance if and when ya get a chance to answer this.   I get it.  Thanks guys.   Are we talking within their historical context and so forth?  The difference of how movements, in this case feminism, are often hijacked for whatever agendas people try to push?   That has always been my biggest issue, especially by the original suffrogates.  The whole 'we want to have our cake, and eat it to'   So would that be a recomended read to study up on the history and momentum and semantics and goals of the movement from past to present?   I get what you are saying, but you misunderstood what I was getting it.  In that instance, I was not talking about the modern, undying, endless complaint of feminism, the feminism that I'm pretty sure both you and I and everyone else here knows is bat-shit crazy, unfounded, and continues to favor women at the expense of men (ie, the feminism that long ago usurped equality, the feminism that those polls and I agree on).  What I mentioned was the textbook definition of feminism, which is sort of what brought this conversation and line of questioning around in the first place, and while your first response was helpful, it seems to me that you are jumping ahead of the conversation now.  Most responses on this post so far have been very neutral, resonable, and thought-provoking - those posters understood what I was and am asking -  and it was far removed from "this thread might not be for you," so please don't patronize me.   As you said yourself, a lot of people support equality.  Here is the dictionary definition of feminism:  the advocacy of women's rights on the grounds of political, social, and economic equality to men.  Being that we are well past that, it is not relevant.  There is nothing about propogating myths, bull-shit patriarchy theory, rape-culture horse-plop, and other common delusions that are bad for both men and women.  It is simple equality.  Again, just as you said, a lot of people support equality, and again, a lot of people believe (myself included) that feminism is supporting women at the expense of men, and this is why I wanted to ask these questions - to see if and how and where is it still relevant?   And why do I ask this?  Because any dialogue, debate, conversation, or issue has many sides, and I'd be a dick to not see what the reasonable and sane people in their field are saying these days, because all I can find is reactionary, myth-spreading, propoganda bull-shit from illogical, unreasonable SJW's and wierdo feminists.  These self-absorbed peoople have drowned out the sane people in their respective field of work, and this has been the problem - it has been hard to find them.  Hence, this thread.   Right, and the same thing could be said about men:  Ie, in China, men are burdened with the responsibility of taking care of their elder parents, hence everyone wants boys instead of girls.  In a lot of Arab countries, while woman are often treated poorly, so are the men, and the men are still required by law to be the sole providers for their family, so once more, there is no need to prioritize women over men.  As you said, we both have our unique challenges.   Perfect.  I was looking for something like this.  Thank you - will have to check it out and see if it is indeed... relevant and 'fair,' or 'sane,' for lack of better words :)     Bingo.  Feminism is no longer a legitimate complaint, it is an endless complaint.  But that's what I was looking for - to see if there are any relevant or sane ones in the Western World.  Thanks for your input :D    Yeah - but that goes with pecking orders - a lack of structure and heirarchy, but then again, dissenters always pop up in any movement, and I've seen all the in-fighting between feminist rhethoric of "real feminist have curves" vs. "real feminists love their bodies no matter what" or choice feminist vs. total feminist or more "important matters" and I'm right and you're wrong and all the pointless back and forth of it all - but it still remains shallow and irrelevant because as far as the text book definition of feminism goes that most people are fine with, we surpassed that long ago.   As for Marxism, I didn't say all of them were or are that way, but take someone like Bell Hook, and you have a potential cult leader who makes Marx look like a moderate.  Worse, she has influenced many feminists since her time.  Thank god there are enough sane people out there who just ignore nutjobs like her :)   Ah, that's what I figured.  That any feminist who wanted to be taken seriously beyond the far-flung cultish modern-day feminist circle would have to call themselves something else, to dissasociate themselves from all the extremists.  That being said, "equity feminist" sounds like the textbook definition of feminism, which, I'm pretty sure no polite and mostly sane person would really argue against, BUT, this goes back to the original point.  Is it even necessary in the Western World? Being that we have more or less reached that ideal and continue to go far beyond it in any reasonable manner?    Hi.  How ya doin?  Your response sounds a bit bristly, at least, thats how it reads to me but I totally get it.  This is my main question - is all that is left cringeworthy, leftist, socialist nutjobs who will never be happy until the world is torn down, and reconstructed from the vagina up?   What's up guys?  Dead serious in my questions here.  Are there some modern feminists who are actually relevant in the western world, making logical and reasonable arguments in the name of whatever their causes are?  I ask, because I'm so inundated with the chronically malcontent, marxist, completely illogical and hypocritical nutjobs like the Sarkisians and Hooks and Parks and SJW's and etc - the one's who say "gender issues" and mean women only, because what else would they talk about?     To clarify, I suppose I could as, are there feminist women akin to say, Karen Straughan as an MRA, making sane, historically accurate, fact-based, logical arguments in whatever facet of feminism they are chatting about?  Or does that even exist?     Because all I find in my searching is historically inaccurate bull-shit, emotional/identity politics, and people talking out of their asses.   Thanks in advance for your replies.   Edit:  To be clear, I am asking here because I don't want to steep my fingers and brain in the piranha infested waters of feminist echo chambers here on Reddit.  Also, I'm banned from most of said echo chambers, because as you know, positing polite, rational, arguments and dissenting opinions and facts are all synonymous with harassment, hence I got the ban-hammer.  Thanks again.   "This world - why does everything gotta turn to mush?  It reminds me of Alphabits cereal.  See, you're too young to remember, but my dad.  My dad used to pour his stale beer into my alphabits and make me eat it.  And I'd look at those letters, those fucking letters, and part of me knew they were little pieces of a bigger whole.  They made up tha bigger picture, ya know?  You could create something out of 'em.  But I'd stare at those fuckin letters, and they were everywhere.  None of it made any sense.  A's and B's and C's all over the place, and I knew they were supposed to make up words, but there were no words in that shit soup.  I looked and I looked but it was all meaningless.  No rhyme or reason.  And even then, it all turned to mush in the end anyway.  Everything turns into mush."    Edit:  obligatory big word - zamboni!  Edit of edit:  Frank doesn't know how to spell obligatory   Apparently no one here has a sense of humor :D   NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!   Is it true - Is Pluto no longer classified as a planet?  How come no body told me?! :(   Always some dip-shit in a BMW derping up the road-ways :/   Yeah. If each dude owns equal shares, or any shares period, he couldn't just write him out. He'd have to buy him out. You'd have to make it more like, A gave B a high position w/o actual ownership, and then fired him, though, that takes out the whole impact of a sly maneuver. It becomes a boss firing a dude rather than betrayal. That, or do some research and find exceptions and loopholes to these things for yourself. In the history of business, I'm sure plenty of slime-balls have figured out how to screw over their slime ball partners, it just has to be believable :D   Yeah.  That's what us viewers/readers are left with considering Martin's and the show-writers' creative choices.  I mean, none of them knew how it would truly pan out for the fans, and to that I say, sure, subvert it all you want, but that doesn't mean it's going to come off as a good narrative, or more importantly, a satisfying one :/   I agree on the fuck everyone part, but if it really is as simple as killing off Jon (along with Stanis who we have been following since season 1 and everyone else), I will truly be annoyed at what I see as lazy story-telling.  I get it that it is subversive story-telling and not a formulaic tale of "good vs. evil" and all that, but still, what's the point?  If you're just going to kill anyone and everyone off, stop being a dick to fans and taking forever to tell the story.  Just condense it and be done with it already, because one ending in this case and method is apparently as good as any other :D   Butt paying?  How does one butt pay?  0_o  Butt yes, good point!   But that's part of being a *I'm a how shit works in the real world-ist.*  No one wants to do that, but most of them do.  Except the people who are starving in third world shit-holes :D   Full circle, AKA, "I'm born to pay bills and die-ist" :P   Yeah, most of you were born to also not use your turn signals, and hold up lines in stores to ask stupid questions :D   Most* of you are.   Right.  If only Hitler would have run on the platform of *"We're gonna systematically kill off millions of Jews and other perverts,"* rather than just blaming them for Germany's problems.   Honestly, I'd vote for a politician who was that straight-forward, so long as he didn't discriminate.  *"Kill 'em all"* is what my grandma always said.  No time or need to discriminate :)   Edit:  To be sure, this wasn't meant as /sarcastic or smart-assery.  I do appreciate that line of thought, but that doesn't make me stop wishing that good, old, honorable and stupid Ned was still around :(   [His face double.](http://www.wallpaperhi.com/Animals/Dogs/Basset_hound_dog_Sad_puppy_13477)   According to the show's writers, to secure Martin's trust, they had to answer who they thought Jon Snow's mother was.  Source:  http://www.businessinsider.com/the-game-of-thrones-writers-had-to-answer-this-trick-question-2015-4   Why would Jon's parentage even matter if he wasn't alive as a player in the story?  Quite simply, it wouldn't.  And if in George's mind that is the pivotal question to ask in this story, then it wouldn't make sense to leave him as dead, even though resurrection has been sparse thus far in the narrative.  It would just be another dead-end plot line. My speculation is that Stanis was done away with (be it dead or made irrelevant) so Melisandre could be written back to Castle Black to bring Jon to life.     Would love to here other's opinions and ideas here, be it for or against the liklihood of Jon coming back.   Edit:  Clarity and English speaking gooder   Dude.  He's not dead:  http://www.businessinsider.com/the-game-of-thrones-writers-had-to-answer-this-trick-question-2015-4   Why would GRR even ask the question, or why would Jon's parentage matter if Jon wasn't alive?  I suppose it could be another plot-line that doesn't matter, as this show ultimately has plenty of those :D  Edit:  Here, I just posted this:  http://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/39w2w3/all_spoilers_how_i_know_a_certain_character_isnt/   Don't get me wrong.  I love these sadists.  Let's hear it!   Haven't we been misled before though?  I mean, would he be allowed to say anything else if say, the Lord of Light was going to bring him back?   Would totally make demon-babies with her :D   I hope she is a plot device to bring Jon Snow to life back at Castle Black :D   I think you're a big 'ol domey, but I agree.  I think they're either gonna kill Jon off forever, or the Lord of Firecrackers will bring him to life.  Why else would they write the fire-slut back to Castle Black?  What other purpose does she serve now that her host Stanis is dead?  What power-hungry, child-murdering, dick-wad will she attach herself to next.   Yeah, but even with Martin's points about subverting traditional narrative, not even he knew how all this would affect his readers and fans.  I'm okay with plots not panning out the way I expect them, as I agree that they keep us fans on our toes, but to have a character since season one peter out like that, just seemed kinda...lame, almost like *that actor was asking for too much money, just kill them off* kinda lame :D   I like to flay puppies and rape my wife too, but I swear, I'm not that hateable :D   Yeah, hence I said *(or at least what we see of it [Stanis' ending])*, and I do agree that it was kinda fun that it came around full circle to Stanis being sentenced to die by Brie the Cheese Amazonian, but at the same time, it just kinda seemed, meager and weak, or easy, or even a bit cheesy and lazy...     I guess this goes in line with what I said in this same post about subverting the traditional narrative:  you don't get the simple satisfaction of *beginning - middle - end, good (or bad) guys saves the day, and somebody wins,* and you are left with a few moments of satisfaction in between a sea of too many story-lines, favorite character's deaths, and a book-series that might never be finished, but again, that rests on the reader or viewer's opinions :D   In subverting traditional narrative and creating an unprecedented epic like GoT, this is what we are left with:  there IS NO satisfaction to be had, at least anything that is akin to traditional story telling (literature, movies, etc).  It's more closely related to history - a lot of people vie for power and riches, but most just fall by the wayside.  I don't think Martin himself knew the true effect it would have on his fans, or story-telling in general, even though he has made his statements on these matters, and more power to him for it.     The point is, what we get are few moments of satisfaction in between a lot of frustration, character deaths, and annoying story-arcs that either go on too long, or peter out with little fanfare (Stanis), or aren't given enough development and focus, but those opinions are all up to the reader and/or viewer.   Dude, the Hebrew God was a total dick.  Take that, you pillar of salt!  \  Edit:  that being said, journey or not, I thought the end for Stanis (or at least what we see of it) was kinda lame.  But I guess that goes hand in hand with the journey - it's not all fireworks, but I don't care to justify their creative direction.  It was lame :D   I just put a pack of frozen peas on my head.  Bam!  Dinner and coolant!   Stupid people.  Shouldn't some sort of politician gotten rid of a good 75% of people by now?!  Seriously.  The streets and roads are clogged with idiots who just stare at things and don't use turn signals and are oblivious to what's around them :D   I see through your tricks, James Troutman!  */tinfoil hat on*   Can you alliterate that a bit more?   For the most part, I agree with a lot of writers here who say to stick with "say/says/said."  I don't advise or report or remind or taunt on any given day, but I likely said some shit. Said works great.   The rest are often too mechanical, and there is nothing worse than reading someone who just figured out how to use a thesaurus, but if a writer can make them work, then go for it :D   Are you 20 or younger by chance?  Mid to late teens?  Either way, if this is the style you are pursuing, I can at least say that it is suited to young adults, and not adult-adults.  That being said, you still need to work on your grammar, spelling, and organization.  You need what every young and amateur writer needs:  hundreds and thousands of hours of practice and study.  It's not a bad thing, it's just the way of things.   Don't worry about the formatting, I know reddit can be a PITA.  As for an honest analysis from myself, this sums it up:  *" Before you zone out ,and stop reading-*" Too late, I already did.  I feel sort of patronized by that, almost as if the author is saying, *"I know this is boring, but hang with me for a bit longer."*  Why would I?  Why should I?  I'm not saying that I would never be interested in this sort of comic-book esque, punchy and gimmicky young-adult thrill ride, but it would have to be rock solid in execution (and I'm talking all around delivery, not just grammar and spelling) for me to keep going.   It shows up as [removed].  I think the mods took it down?  And as an FYI, original posters still see their comments, even if they have been banned/removed/whatever, though I don't know if it's true in all cases.   Now I'm sad :P   Uh oh...  I see you removed it, but that is not a good sign to me that you begin with "what spelling errors."  That being said, I can't provide an example because you removed it, but instead, might I suggest more practice in both reading and writing, especially with fundamentals in grammar and spelling.  Good luck to you!   Glad you took the time to comment.   Haha.  I love the touch on maturity in there.  Thanks for the list.  There's nothing like a decade or two to help one mature as a person, and a writer.  As for myself, my voice is bedrock, but even with thousands of hours of practice (both reaqin and writing) behind me, I still feel like there are thousands of more to go, to be as good as I need and want to be, for any given story's sake.  Wish me luck, and thanks again :)   Neil Gaiman is masterful artist, and while it might seem like a dick-move at first, he is telling a novice to start with the basics, the root of the whole thing: writing (as a reflection of what you want to read, and by proxy have read).  It isn't magic, it's work.  Sure, there are a zillion how-to books and degrees, and more specific and cryptic advice out there, but at the end of the day, it comes down to reading and writing.  There is no magic, no trick, no easy way around hundreds and thousands of hours of practice, patience, and work.   I mean, how many posts pop up here (and elsewhere) of, *"Hey, I want to be a writer, but I don't read much, and I don't write much, (or at all).  How do I write a master-piece?"*   Worth noting, these far-fetched desires of instant gratification, or seeking the easiest route are not limited to people who want to 'become' writers.  :)   I love KVJ and his rules, among the many other writers and their own self-chosen rules, but I've read plenty of masterful writers who violated any and all of these, KVJ included.  But that is to be expected once people are experienced and skilled enough.  I mainly say this because plenty of these rules will just confuse new and less experienced writers, even more so if they try to adhere to the zillions of other rules out there.  The end result could scatter their efforts in a million directions, none of them being any good, but even that is a learning experience.  Case in point, see #7    Also, as much as I love writers torturing their characters to show off their mettle or lack thereof (myself included), there is also something to be said of the moments in between the action, where the characters truly live.  This should not be overlooked or glossed over, though it depends on the genre, as there are big differences in character driven stories and action driven stories.  The point is, I'd just like to point out that any idiot with a pulse can survive a disaster, whether they do it kicking and screaming, or with great poise and dignity, but it's the little moments, the moments that make up the majority of our lives, that really define us and put us to the test.   Oh, cool.  I hope it helps.  I just used it today.  I uploaded a file to Onedrive straight from my home PC at 4AM, and accessed it a little while ago from my e-mail to print and edit it from a different PC, using word online.  Sure, I could just e-mail it to myself, or use a USB, but it does give you a lot of options, especially when you have accesss to the internet to use MS word online, but lack the program itself.   I like the subtleness of the thing :)   I actually write erotica and romance quite well, but no, as with many men, I don't attempt to write women, because that is best left for the women :D   So I dout it is some conspiracy (especially bya  woman-dominated industry) to keep women down.  Are men just more prolific, and more dedicated to the craft?  I mean, it is stupid to hold something against them if it is because they are industrious, prolific, and more driven...   I know you asked about a few specific things, but being that you mentioned you lack experience and knowledge, here is a fairly rounded and earnest approach: Writing is work, and it is a skill.  Inspiration comes and goes, but it takes discipline to follow through, especially on less inspired days.  Most talented authors got there by thousands of hours of both reading and writing.  In short, a lot of time and patience and work.  I'd suggest reading a lot and studying what makes great authors so hard to put down (pacing, movement, a good plot, good characters, their own unique style, etc.).  In between reading hundreds of books and stories, work on some of your own material.  As far as organizational skills and learning how to traditionally plot out stories, there are plenty of how-to books and articles out there, just keep in mind that plenty of great writers achieved great or master or even 'decent' status without any how-to books or formal education, but what they did have is experience, in both life, and reading and writing.     nbsp;  Most new writers start off with imitation (as do most artists in any field), but that is a good start.  From there you can develop a voice of your own, while learning to spin a good yarn with style and drive and movement, while simultaneously learning to balance all the nuances of exposition, dialogue, plot points, and so forth.   nbsp;  I know it's not exactly what you asked for, but I believe it to be fair advice for any new writer, as the original post is sort of akin to someone saying, *"I know how to change my oil, now how can I take apart the engine and put it back together?"*  Good luck, now get to work :D   Not going to get into plot/story here, as ideally that is all worked out.  As for the rest:   When I have edited it myself several times, have had a few others take a look as well - when I have fixed 99% of minor typos and grammar errors, when the rhythm and cadence is perfect and in step, and when I can read through it without needing to change anything (other than the desire for creative changes)... but even then, I can then change the fuck out of it, but ya gotta call it done sometime.   LOL!  That's right, be a sadist!  Show what your characters are made of.  That being said, you know they say any idiot can weather a crisis... but that's when you kill them :D   Oh no!  Instead of fan-fic twilight, this is real life 50 shades?  /wrists   In all seriousness, just change the names and circumstances and details and use a pseudonym and don't show your boss and etc. and if he does see it just tell him it's 50 shades of gray fan fic.   What is this for?   I don't say this to be a dick, but to be fairly critical:  it sounds  a bit gimmicky, and far too generic.  Also, it needs a lot of proof-reading.  There are spelling errors, abbreviation errors, grammar errors, you can get rid of the cursing as it doesn't add much to it (my opinion there), and in general, it needs some solid polishing.   Aside smaller devices with dedicated software and aps, the best I can think to suggest, and the one I enjoy using is MS word and Onedrive hooked into an outlook or Hotmail account.  If I'm in a hurry, I just write and edit within an e-mail draft, but if I have more time and space, I use Onedrive.  Super easy to share, edit from any device, etc.  Worth noting that Hotmail itself comes with MS Word Online free (a stripped down version of MS Word), and lots of storage, and access to for easy sharing, writing, and some other cool features through onedrive.  Between my home CPU, and the mobile versions and onedrive, it all links together quite nicely.   I'd recommend saving often, as I have had ms word online have issues (once in like, 2 years?), but that was related to a crappy internet connection, not the program itself.  Worth noting that I'd recommend that any writer saves often, and to multiple locations, including the cloud and a USB :D    To put it simply as possible, it means demonstrating something through action (creating an active scene) rather than telling it in exposition (like a plain dictionary or encyclopedic explanation).   Here are a few quick fun and ridiculous examples:  He was the most evil person I ever met, and he was so evil, he was more evil than Satan. Rosemary was very scared. So scared, that she went crazy. (Telling)  His face was statuesque and unmoving as he sucked the last drop of blood from the lifeless child.  Rosemary's skin crawled, her mind recoiling beyond terror, blank and vacuous at having witnessed such a monster.  To this day, she sits in her asylum cell, unable to utter a single word (showing).    Though these examples are ridiculous, The difference is quite clear.    That being said, there is more nuance to it than that, as they can border each other very closely, but if the concensus of a large enough sample of people say the same thing, than you might just need to do a better job of showing, and not necessarily try to tell instead. I'd say the biggest difference between masters and amateurs (as with most things in writing), is knowing when to utilize each one, and knowing how to strike a balance between them.    Yeah.  Funny that you say that.  Aside more obvious characters that are shown on cover art, or other odds and ends like that, no matter how they describe the characters, I tend to picture them how I want to picture them anyhow, and my imagination fills in any of the blanks, even when I'm not trying consciously to do it.  It's the same thing for voices and other quirks, which is the same reason IMO that a lot of movies are "never as good as the books," because the movie just wasn't as good as I originally imagined it in my head, plus, I might hate the actor they chose, simply because it is far removed from the vision I had in my head :P   Yeah.  I tend to take it as a case by case, writer by writer basis.  I mean, my girlfriend loves Nabakov, and as much as I respect his command/love of language, I can't stand reading him.  He is just too verbose, and I'm thinking, get to the point.  That being said, I know book readers read for a variety of reasons, and I appreciate the little nuances and quiet moments of literature.  If I needed constant explosions and plot twists and heart-popping narratives, I'd watch a movie, or read a spy novel (which I don't care for), but for all the writers I do like (many who are well-known enough that they don't or didn't have to rely on punchier hooks or gimmicks), one thing is for certain:  they know how to pace and move a story.  Even if they do get stuck up in someone's head, or even if they do have a lot of quiet moments or a simpler story that doesn't hinge on large action, they have the pacing and movement down solid, without fail.  IMO, that always sets the masters apart their less experienced or less skilled contemporaries, or amateur writers in general.  Plenty of stories that seem uninteresting enough come to mind, but the writers who wrote them were masters at drawing the reader in and tangling them up in the movement and plot, and my god, what happens next?!   What do you prefer and enjoy?   My apologies, I meant no offense against you or any other intern out there.  I don't know the ins and outs of large publishing companies.  For example, I did not know they relied so heavily upon interns for key aspects of the work.  I thought they would have started the interns off with a simpler job.  That, and I read that "300 manuscripts a week" as "300 manuscripts a year," which still sounded like a lot ;)   Also, I put another edit onto my second post asking about the pop-psychological to molehill mistake you mentioned, so if you have the time, that would be great.  Also, you should do an AMA sometime :)   Thanks for the answers.  Quick follow up questions (with more to come later) - so why does the intern have so much power there?  Are the agents just that busy?  How did they know how they could trust your judgment?   Edit:  Also, can you give an example of this:  *and tried to make plot mountains out of pop-psychology molehills*?  Perhaps I am not as familiar with this because I don't read much women's fiction myself (aside a few really knock-out artists out there), but if it is similar enough to a lot of modern day navel-gazing and hipster-esque writing, and other amateur mistakes, then I might have an idea of what you mean.  :)   Are you talking about the difference of say, literature that deals in more universal and timeless truths, vs. a modern, popular phenomenon that won't hold its weight in the years to come?   While we often have similar sexual ques, Keep in mind the gender differences in behavior, as well as what physical aspects of a personality attract each sex, and the differences are quite real (ie, men are typically the ones to initiate contact - they are more aggressive and overt, wheeras females preen and flutter their eye-lashes and smile and perform subtle acts to attract men).  Men often notice women due their physical features (and we all notice appearance before anything else, as we don't have a clue about a stranger's personality), especially since many women use make-up and clothes to accentuate said features.   Women notice a man's status (on top of 'would I fuck him or not, nice jaw-line, nice ass, etc).  I've known plenty of women to say they noticed 'how well dressed a man is,' what kind of car he drives, etc first, but I've also known plenty of them to pretty much admit that their first thought was, "he's hot, I'd bone him."   I don't say this to reenforce any stereotypes, but let's say we were to go with the old-school sexism, than women are objects of ornamentation, and men are mere utility devices.  I'll be bold and just say, women notice status on top of physical desire and attraction, whereas, a man would fuck a hot woman even if she lived in a box, if he could ;)   Mind if I pick your brain?  Sure you say?  Cool.  Thank you :)   What did you think of all those manuscripts you read?  Earnestly, what were the biggest shortcomings?  Were a lot of them just amateur-ish and sloppy?  How many people do you think thought they had something great and original, but was really just redundant and lacking in creativity?  How many were just really bad writers (even if they had good ideas)?  What were the most consistent mistakes/problems you saw in the writing?  And how about in the story-telling itself?  And how about that one that got through - how good was that one?  What made it stand out?  Thanks in advance, if and when you have the time to answer :)   I agree, and it is the fundamental problem I see with this young, naive generation of what have been dubbed SJWs:  the over-simplification of complicated issues.  Without getting to far into that, I mean, once we chop it up, what do the numbers look like?  Ie., with random numbers: Out of 100 men, only 2 are gay.  Out of Those 100 men, only 20 are interested in writing, 18 of them straight, and both gay males want to be writers.  Out of the 18 straight writers, only 5 take it seriously enough to finish and submit work and commit to the discipline of a working writer, and out of those 5, maybe 1 or 2 are actually published?  And how would those stats look taking our sample of the 2% of gay men.  What if both gay writers just happened to be shitty writers and are never published?  I imagine those numbers are driven down even lower for trans people, because they are an even smaller percent of the population...   The point is, I don't think the "women only" approach simply because of, well, vagina, is a good solution or a workable answer.  Ideally, if women do want equality, this sort of thing would be based on merit, not because again:  vagina.   The problem is, after decades of being beaten over the head with it, "gender issues" and "gender inequality" has become synonymous with "women's issues."  Let's look at it from another angle:   Yes, gender inequality sucks, and it's rough that men are stronger, and thus they are the ones who have had to take all the back-breaking jobs since we were monkeys, and that is the reason that most dangerous jobs are dominated by men to this day, and why armies have always been primarily comprised of men, ready for the slaughter.  What I'm getting at is, gender is more than a social construct, and it was defined and refined by both biological limitations and abilities.  It wasn't some conspiracy by the great patriarchy of man to elevate men at the expense of women, after all, all sane societies protected women, as they were the only ones who could make babies.  Sure, the field of writing has been historically dominated by men (as has the Earth in general), but feminism is just fighting for a reason to justify its existence in the modern, western world these days.  Continually treating women like children, and letting them win just because, well, vagina, serves only to patronize them, and takes us backwards in what they have fought so long and hard for:  equality.  And equality should exist where it can exist, but not necessarily forced down our throats, especially at the detriments of others.   Yep.  Women are always the passive voice, and men are always the active voice.  The only answer is to (continually) silence the men, since women are like children and should be treated as such.  /s   I heard that the publishing industry was dominated by women nowadays?  From editors to agents to authors... ?   Edit - To expand and explain a more important point, doesn't the world continually treating women like children only serve to further the equality gap and patronize women?  I mean, this falls under that dated notion of *men are the active voice, agents of change, and females are the passive voice, perpetual victims or objects to be acted upon*?  And isn't the point of being a strong woman demonstrating that for yourself, rather than doing it by removing the competition or letting you win for no other reason than vagina?   Bingo!  It brings to mind another saying, something along the lines of *"Any idiot can tough out a crisis, but it's the day-to-day stuff that wears you out."*  I think Borris Shmirnoff or Tommy Wisseau said it :D   IMO, if it feels like filler, and it reads as boring or too far removed or disengaging, or superfluous, then it probably is filler, and should be deleted or rewritten.  That, or just condense your stories.  Reading stories with filler like that is like eating that cheap "chocolate chip ice cream" that is mostly vanilla.  I feel cheated and annoyed afterwards, if I can even stomach it.  Worth asking - if you are bored or uninterested in writing or editing it, why wouldn't a reader be bored reading and digesting it?  When I read what I view as a solid story, I typically never think of any of it as filler.  (Same thing goes for movies and TV).   That being said, if it keeps you writing, rather than staring at a blank screen, then I'd say keep it up, especially because you never know when some idea that starts as filler could be developed and spun into gold, or at the least, replaced or deleted all together in lou of something more relevant, or preferably, no filler at all.  As others have said, there could be bits of history or story or character related points that could be used as well instead of 'filler,' so long as it flows naturally enough.   What has helped me most through the years has been to plot my stories out more concisely, especially if they are longer.  I don't necessarily or preferably need to know every single twist and turn, but I do need a solid bridge from A to Z.  Having some wiggle room has always been good too, as I've often had secondary ideas and plot supplant the originals, but everyone is differenct.   In short, to me the ideal story doesn't feel like it has any filler.  Form and style and genre don't matter in this, so long as it is crafted and constructed and strung together beatifully.    I am a big fan of impressions (especially combined with small actions) over a writer trying to model a 3D face and body in my head, but each has its time and place depending on the writer and the story, but I definately agree with you on the specific height/weight descriptions with numbers.  I mean, we do make a zillion unconscious snap judgments in our head in the span of a second when we meet someone, but it never involves such mathematical specifics.  In general, I find that impressions vs. descriptions often fall under the whole 'less is more' idea, and depending on the genre, I often prefer it.   I recently described a prostitute along the lines of "a gutter-gaunt brunette, with long hair that vined across her face and spidery eye lashes flung over painted eyes set above a sharp nose and her plump rose-bud mouth" or something like that.  I was basically aiming for cracked out peacock, a withering painting of nature itself.  Something along those lines.   I enjoy both wildly detailed, more traditional literary ramblings, but I also appreciate the short and terse descriptions, especially when they exemplify "saying more with less."  I think it just depends on the writer and the story.     I read a short story recently, with the focus on being a 'nobody/anonymous/little guy' so to speak, and the writer never even really described the character or named him, and among a few other odds and ends, it really served to cement the notion of being anonymous and over-looked and confined to one's headspace.   Yes, I win!  Wait, FUUUUUUUUU!   Who the hell is that anyhow?  I'm all like, hello random good-looking, generic tattooed guy :D   That's the point of this subreddit :D   Ah, ok.  None of the edits were there when I first saw this :)   LOL.  Thanks for sharing.   Wait, what?  You received brain surgery?  Or gave another student brain surgery?   TIL that teachers of young children are some of the dumbest motherfuckers out there...   LOL   Yeah.  They are well-intentioned idiots, but idiots nonetheless.  I do think a lot of it is fed by the more modern helicopter-parenting climate, but that is a whole nother issue in and of itself.  Think about it - whole new generations of liberal and progressive parents, teaching their children to feel guilty over their existence, 'entitlement' shame for any hard-earned 'privelage,' and then battering them with the never-ending list of 'women's issues,' because men are expected to take whatever bull-shit life throws at them, and as if we haven't been beaten over the head with the club of women's issues our entire lives.  I don't know where you are from friend, but in my country, the social-political climate is ripe with idiots and ignorance :D   Here is a good introductory video into their bizaare world.  The man critiquing it is actually quite sensible and reasonable, even about issues he doesn't necessarily care for, though his approach is one of satire and sarcasm.  Since you might not be familiar with the format of some of his videos, the girl in the SJW video is presenting what she sees as the issues, then answering said issues in a snarky, sarcastic manner, and in turn, Sargon cuts through the veil of bull-shit and translates it to the root of what they are saying.  He's really good at pointing out people's ignornace.  Enjoy  :)   The Video:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8rXm-5ICFk   Yeah, my girlfriend (brutal plant killer and eater that she is), is in a similar boat as you in trying to go full vegan.  She mentioned seeing someone else being ripped apart in a vegan forum for mentioning that they didn't consider mussels animals due to their lack of a brain and nevous system or whatever, and thus mussels are more akin to plants, but every asshole vegan in the house jumped down their throat because obviously said person was worse than Hitler and Hipsters combined.  Case in point, an interesting read (even though I don't care much for the incessant, redundant vegan propoganda that precedes 99% of Vegans out there; they wear that shit like a smug cloak of moral superiority):     http://www.slate.com/articles/life/food/2010/04/consider_the_oyster.html   Social Justice Warriors.  AKA, naive children from Candyland who want to blanket the world in protective foam, because they don't understand that the world aint fair, and that adversity is key to the human experience, as it brings growth, understanding, and maturity.   Yes.  Nothing says pretension like *"SLAAAAAAAAAAAYERRRRRR!" \m/ \m/*   Every and any student ever at a Liberal College.   Hahaha.  I remember that joke.  I originally saw it in print in an interview from way back in the 90's, but it was also reissued in Revolver's TOOL-only issue a few years after 10,000 Days dropped.   The band has a restraining order on me and I am no longer allowed to visit the Caduceus Vineyards.  Also, I tattooed TOOL on my forehead.  Top that you pretentious Tool fan!   Hahaha.  That was a great series, huh?  What did you think over-all?  I'm dissapointed that people like Cole don't actually exist in the world and talk and act like that, but they made him believable enough within the show.     Ahem, but the point remains - just because we're made from the same muck doesn't mean we are all equal.  Let's let character and integrity and actions and words determine that, and be the only true judge.  Also, fuck egalitarianism :P  	108
 beautiful comment   Yeah, how the hell would that work in real life?   Crazy how he went from a young cocky prick to a mature war-veteran with a traditional view of justice.   What the hell is with Chris Evans and Scarlett Johansson always being in movies together? Not that I'm complaining. I'm assuming they've fucked at some point.   Eyeeeee want it thaaahat way.   Eyeeeee want it thaaahat way.   Ain't nothing but a heartache.   I saw the trailer, I haven't seen it. Not quite sure if it's even gotten a US release yet but, to be quite honest, I'm not into "back in the age" martial arts films with swords and etc.  When I think of Jackie Chan, I think of modern martial arts action-comedy movies. [For example, this scene from "Who Am I" is one of my favorites.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJ5oaBWYzPk)  I've also noticed a lot of American movies getting better and better with their martial arts choreography. [Most notable one for me was this scene from Captain America: The Winter Soldier.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHh0XaW0UyQ)  [Have you seen Every Frame a Painting's video about Jackie Chan's action-comedic style?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1PCtIaM_GQ) Great video.   That said, I enjoyed the Chris Pratt mixtape thing.  Honestly, the only redeeming factor of the movie for me.    The problem is though the dogs tended to get scared and run back to their masters...with the bomb.  lol'd   Step Brothers.  I don't think it's *that* funny yet people in my city quote it like it's the comedy movie of the century.  "IT'S THE FUCKING CATALINA WINE MIXER"  Okay...   [removed]   Can't wait!!   Watch gaming videos... I spend a lot of time on Reddit and YouTube nowadays because it makes me feel like I'm not alone even if I physically am if that makes sense.      Context please. Was it about fatpeoplehate?   What the fuck is with all the top deleted comments? Context please.    What the fuck is with all the top deleted comments? Context please.   Gotcha, thank you. And yeah I had no idea what an indie game was or what "indie label" music meant until now. I mean, I'm assuming it means the same for "indie label" music, right?   Fuck, I just made a big comment describing this scene before I found that you already replied with the link.   Reminds of the scene in Enter the Dragon where a bully Martial Artist challenges Bruce Lee on the ship. He questions Lee's style of fighting to which Lee claims his style is, "The Art of Fighting Without Fighting." The Bully challenges Lee and boasts that he can defeat his style to which Lee says that they need more room. Lee points to an island and  suggests they take one of the smaller boats from the ship to ride out there. As the bully climbs down to the boat, Lee releases the line and the bully is trapped in the boat off the ship where he can no longer bully the people on the ship.  The Art of Fighting Without Fighting.   You're fucked. Have an upvote.   [The Life in The Machine](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/u7zc2/the_life_in_the_machine).   sounds like a /r/nosleep story    whoa thought that was gonna be a /r/nosleep story    What exactly is an "indie game" btw?   Thank you, friend. I will check it out.   Oh shit.      Hi-Five! did the same thing here ;)   That's extremely inconvenient. I'm sorry to hear that but I hope you enjoy your game.   B-But Charmander gets Metal Claw.   Why the hell did you delete your account?   that fucking yawn.   YES! So that is why you must price match from Target at Walmart. But I agree, that policy is bullshit.   Do you remember what time in the video?   Unfortunately the register girl was a dumbass when I went and told me they don't price match against their own prices so I brought up Target's prices for ORAS. Still $29.99 but the fact that I had to do that and the fact that Walmart has two different price tags for the same item is bullshit. The girl probably didn't know the correct policy on that too because the guy working the electronics section told me it was fine if I price matched from their website so long as it was the same item.   Wanted to post this comment as soon as you posted yours but Reddit's comment delay timer bullshit mechanic prevented me from doing so.   The only reason I can think of is because Wi-Fi distribution events are inconvenient for them. They hardly ever do Wi-Fi events. We live in a generation where you can distribute an event to anyone with Wi-Fi access and they still make us go pick something up "in-store."   Fantastic!!!  Oh, no. I asked my dad and apparently the Macbook Pro w/Retina doesn't have a LAN port because it is Wi-Fi only :(   So I guess that means I would have to buy an adaptor of some sort?    Thank you, friend.   so op lied   wtf cant tell if srs   No, if you go to Walmart and buy it - it costs $39.99...   Did "./relaymyhome full" from there and got this http://i.imgur.com/p2h7oP4.png  I'm assuming everything went well and all I need to do is to connect my Macbook Pro w/Retina Display to a LAN Cable which is also connected to my Router while my N3DS is in sleep-mode and I will receive Eon Ticket via Street Pass? :D   ALSO btw, why does Homepass keep turning my Wi-Fi on and off?  EDIT: Going to sleep now. Will reply when I wake up. very tired. I appreciate your help so much. You didn't have to do this. Thank you for everything /u/sirence9   Oh no problem thank you! I corrected it here. What next?  http://i.imgur.com/V8pwt8s.png   Okay! What next? http://i.imgur.com/OEneeKg.png   real mvp   Wait, how could she have seen that???   Wait, she turned around? I didn't see her turn around at all.   Wait what do you mean?   Come on Dudley.   What's with Japan and Upskirts? No one wears skirts where I'm from unless they're doing a play or some kind of western event.   Yes friend! What next? http://i.imgur.com/XtkdDAe.png   No but seriously, what's with Traditional Martial Arts and their EMPHASIS on Wrist control for self-defense?   Why the hell are you training with fellow students, and allowing other students to train each other when they have not received permission from the master to either teach, or lead a class?  It's not a crime to practice with other students outside of class.   It's not a crime to practice with other students outside of class.   Here are screenshots of both the "ls" in termianl  and the network name. The security is also set to none, last time I checked. How can i confirm though?  http://i.imgur.com/hGeTdyw.png  Thank you very much for all your help!! If you could just guide me through the program mechanics so I can do this correctly via Terminal, by tomorrow morning I can ask my dad for the LAN Cable so I can maybe make this work :)   What's the difference beteween the basic Taekwondo Roundhouse Kick and a "Kickboxing" Roundhouse Kick?    Very little if any. The misconception here is that Taekwondo, Karate, Muay Thai, Kickboxing, etc. etc. all are completely different which is not necessarily true. Yes, their are slight differences in mechanics due to each sport having their own ruleset.   WTF Sport Taekwondo, for example, scores kicks via contact with the Instep of the Foot. Taekwondo kicks also, mostly, all start from the chamber position and end chambering back whereas Muay Thai Roundhouse kicks, for example, swing and hit with the ~~instep~~ shin being a "full-contact" sport that doesn't have a focus on points.  However, the proper, basic mechanic of the kick - turning your hips, hand positioning, etc. for all styles should all be very similar. We have several guys that crosstrain in Muay Thai and Kickboxing at my Taekwondo Dojang and one of my Masters used to compete in Thai Boxing competitions back in Asia so I'm speaking from my own personal experience - not just theories pulled out of my butt.  Semantics aside, the basics are the same. If this guy can't perform a proper "TKD form kick," I would definitely question his credibility as a decent "kickboxer."   EDIT: Just my two cents.  EDIT: For the sake of my example above, I was referring to the basic Roundhouse Kick.  EDIT: Meant shin not instep. corrected it   Why's that?   Keep us updated on your situation, OP. Hope things turn out for the better.   OH, I haven't been connecting my Mac with my router via LAN Cable. Not sure how to do that or what a LAN Cable is or if I even have one.  But I'm assuming I should use USB Ethernet then? That sounds correct, right?  Anyways, I went along with the rest of the steps and there's no directory found:  http://i.imgur.com/giyCEC2.png  EDIT: As you can see I clicked on USB Ethernet and selected Wi-Fi   You know that Jun Fan is just Bruce Lee's Chinese name, right? Li Xiaolong was his nickname/stagename but "Jun Fan" is not a style - it's his Chinese Name. Bruce, not having fully learned the Wing Chun system at the time when he moved to the US, opened up a school and dubbed it "Jun Fan Gung Fu" where he taught the Wing Chun concepts he did know along with his own mix of styles he practiced outside of Wing Chun.   added 2 edits to my latest reply.   1. Internet Sharing - http://i.imgur.com/k2VxSdM.png [I selected both Ethernets to be safe]  2. Have Relaymyhome folder in Documents and access it through Terminal with the commands they tell you in the instructions in order.  http://i.imgur.com/7GRfWdt.png  3. Nothing works.  4. Try just accessing the folder by clicking and activating homepass manually. http://i.imgur.com/jUzqeO5.png  5. Nothing is working still. But it looks like it's running.  EDIT: So, what did I do wrong?  EDIT2: Using the alternative method by accessing it without terminal makes it run without anything working. I'll get through several cycles with nothing. No streetpasses whatsoever. And my Street pass for Buzz Nav is definitely on for Omega Ruby.   Okay, you know what I'm going to do? I will screenshot and send you every step I'm doing so you can tell me what I'm doing wrong.   It's okay. I've tried both. Like I said, maybe it's just me. I'm running OS X Yosemite 10.10.1 on a Macbook Pro w/Retina Display.  Maybe the problem is I'm not using terminal at all to navigate. I just go straight to relaymyhome folder and click on the program and activate it from there and it runs like this (you can see me go straight to the folder and clicking on it in the background) http://i.imgur.com/jUzqeO5.png  Theoretically it should work the same but nothing's working and I've tried for a few hours. So I'm giving up. Thank you.         Never heard of that before. Was it popular at one point?   I got two Japanese Hoopas yesterday legit with Ribbons.   So, basically nothing special.   Thank you very much for your help so far, by the way.   No problem. You realize you can screenshot through your Mac, right? Cmd + Shift + 4.  Anyways, I have two Ethernet options, I'm not sure which one to use that is my problem http://i.imgur.com/DrCLCzB.png  See? There's Display Ethernet and USB Ethernet, no just "Ethernet" option.   It's doing this. I went straight to the folder and clicked on and activated homepass without using Terminal. http://i.imgur.com/kXoZ3Gr.png   No streetpasses have been detected. Do I need a USB Ethernet or whatever the hell that is? I'm using a Macbook Pro.     After I use ./relaymyhome full it just says  ./relaymyhome full -bash: ./relaymyhome: is a directory   it doesn't run. and when i try to just use the relaymyhome exec from the folder, it just keeps running and running without anything happening. could you please give me specific step to step on how you did this? I'm following the step to step there but they leave things out and it's bothering me because I'm not doing it correctly. I don't know how to use terminal.    I've tried using that tutorial too. But there's Two Ethernet Options and so far it hasn't been working for me. Idk if I'm doing it properly. Which Ethernet Option should I use? USB Ethernet or Display Ethernet??   Stuck on Step 4. http://i.imgur.com/3lLXSMK.png  No "Wi-Fi Options button." And I'm assuming you meant select Internet Sharing from the "Pull-Down Menu" in Sharing from System Preferences.   The Wi-Fi Options button in the Sharing Menu doesn't pop up for the "Wi-Fi" "share your source from" option.   Also where is the Wi-Fi Options button from the Sharing Menu?   Thank you for your comment. Where can I download this MBA? And how do I find MAC addresses of Spotpass locations?

Wait, why did I get downvoted? I just liked his comment.   Mew Glitch in RBY.   Japan.    Like if you come to a full stop at every stop sign in Chicago you will get rear ended eventually.   HOLY FUCK. I always make a full stop. I've been doing so since I failed my driver's test for making a rolling stop.   never going to chicago.   You must be fun at parties.   WHY IS IT ALWAYS JAPANESE GIRLS   Yes!   Thoughts on Deism?   Is it just me or did it seem Reddit was really boring at first. Like the interface, the front page, the layout seemed sooo... y'know.   I'm sorry, I'll remove it.   Yup in Book 1 he said he'd never firebend again and on the cover of book 3 - he's firebending.      TAKE-HOME LAPTOPS THAT CAN GO ON REDDIT. That's a nice school you go to. And yeah, I get you on the time wasted part! Reddit is the bane of college students.   Bruh, this black guy literally brought a fucking radio and played that shit loud as hell without earphones/headphones in the gym. I've never seen someone so dgaf before in my life.   That's fucking crazy. I'm never eating breakfast again... oh wait, I don't already.   Lol, dude. That's what happened to me too.   I mean, there's a dubbed version of the first movie in Blu-Ray I believe.   Woah those are some really small tits. Nice though.   Did her tits get bigger?   Dude, thanks! Fapfapfapfapfap         So is it fake?   I'm just trying to find the most vague description ever that could be any film on this thread.   Wait, I forgot. What happened in Supercop? Unless you were referring to the old man with the fake boobs...  I know he grabbed a girls' tits while fighting her in one movie. Wasn't Supercop though.  EDIT: Not talking about Rush Hour either. He was fighting a group of tall black girls.   "Hard work beats talent when talent doesn't work hard."   This guy carried a 3.9 GPA in University and graduated with the highest honors. Quoted as a great group leader and had mature academic work. What the hell happened... he seemed like he had a bright future.   Like Dragon Ball GT.   I was thinking about watching that. Is it not good?  I remember the Pre-Time Skip filler arc with Naruto and Sasuke like episode "The Worst Three-Legged Race" was really entertaining and funny.   I came.   Source!?   Will definitely do. I will tell me instructor, straight-up, that I will refuse to have a match with this student again until he purchases arm guards along with shin   instep guards. I'm tired of clashing elbows and shins with this guy. He's a grown man too.   Will definitely do. Thanks for the tip.  It's frustrating how something so small can leave a big impact on your body.  Feels like I still need to take a few days off practice.   Roundhouse Kicks. One of my sparring partners doesn't wear arm guards and keeps his guard down to his sides. Sometimes I get unlucky and catch and elbow since the Roundhouse Kick hits the sides of his body. I ended up limping on my left foot so I couldn't move properly and just did checking motions until he came in and I caught him with a Spinning Hook Kick with my right foot.   The guy I was sparring wasn't using arm guards. And I can't imagine that you'll ever get used to the pain of having a roundhouse kick connect with the instep right on your opponent's elbow. Every time that's happened to me - it puts me out for a few days to a week due to the bruising.  I iced it last night and took ibuprofen but I can hardly walk still.  Hurts to put weight on it.   I do wear instep guards. The Adidas Shin + Instep pads. Still hurts like hell when you roundhouse kick someone's flank when they have arm down and you hit their elbow.   What's your opinion on moontasri's performance and his future in the Ufc   So can you just replace the ink and sticker paper to constantly be able to use the Snap Kiosk or will it just be out of commision once the ink and the paper and what not run out?   Shisui's Mangekyou Sharingan's unique jutsu to alter someone's mind.   I still remember the blowjob ending.  [EDIT: Found it [NSFW]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9b7sd0Uax8U)   I've read that hentai too.   Except maybe a new Boruto series.   Did anyone else notice a change in art style?   Great coloring! But no blood?   Did we ever get a follow-up on what happened to Victoria after the whole Ellen Pao incident?   Did she ever make any public statements, answer any questions?

By all estimates I've seen, Pokemon XD did worse, critically and financially, than XD.  Wait what? Pokemon XD did worse than XD?   But yeah, I guess I agree with what you're saying. To maximize profit, they should just pour their efforts into what they know will sell and if it means shutting down production of more home console RPGs, so be it.  It's nice that they do take the successful story elements from them to add to the main handheld games, though.      costume over a costume.   I never took Carrie as a serious Robin/character, to be honest. Her character design along with those big goggles/glasses looks like Velma from Scooby Doo in Robin cosplay.   what's wrong with boobs  	141
 Samesies. Although while reading a few of the side stories you can tell which ones were left on the cutting room floor. I liked them, but if I were an editor I can see why you'd cut those if you were forced to chop down some pages. They didn't really contribute to the overall story, but they were fun in their own, dark way.    How was it? I've danced around the idea of starting this for quite some time.    The imagery at the end was just inciredble. All the dancing and the scene with the bear and just complete and utter chaos. For the judge, it was very much a God-like moment for him. It was his world and you were lucky to be alive in it. He knew it, felt totally in control, and was comfortable enough to dance like a maniac in light of all these revelations.   Exactly. And look how it worked out for him.    Thanks for the feedback. This was actually my very first book by him. I do have "All the Pretty Horses" and "The Crossing" as well, all of which were fantastic finds at a recent library sale.   I rarely ever read two books in a row from the same author and I may need a little palette cleanser after this one, but I can definitely see myself tackling one of those in the not-so-distant future.    Hey, even Babe Ruth set the original home run record on a healthy diet of hot dogs and beer. Sometimes it just works.  Of course, slugging lumber and jogging around the bases is completely different than hockey, but I digress.   The point is, there is something magical about hot dogs. For me, excessive gas and a trip to the vomitorium. For Gretzky and Ruth, success in different forms.    Just finished this tonight. At times it was a bit verbose, other times beautifully on point, and finally it ended with what can only be described as Heart of Darkness meets the Wild West.  I loved it. Having spoken to a number of people about this one I've discovered that everyone interprets the ending differently. And to that point, even McCarthy won't go so far as to say exactly what happened.  If you've read it I'd love to hear your two cents.    They're often times fairly uneventful. If anything most of the controversy comes in seeing who teams don't protect from the expansion list or where the definitive "journeyman" lands. Then when he gets drafted by an expansion team devout fans go nuts until they watch him phase out on a struggling team.   Just look at the 2000 Draft. Jim Dowd, Joey Juneau, Lyle Odelein. All guys who did their time, and then some.    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2000_NHL_Expansion_Draft   Considering how well soccer has done out there I would love to see a team in Portland. That would be one hell of a scene.  And that's coming from someone who has never been to the city.    Do we see a return of the Nordiques along with the inception of the Las Vegas High Rollers?   Yeah, still under construction. I believe they're targeting 2016 on that.    Directions unclear. Both pinkies now broken.    That entire sequence was just outrageous. His mind went blank but his body relied on instinct. Any time I watch that scene I still can't believe he went the distance, let alone earned the win.    Not for Bradley. No way he takes this fight again. The damage was done in that first one and I think he knows he only has so many more rounds left in him. Provodnikov is too big a risk.    "Wlady, I'm hooooome."   "Give me a second. These old legs don't move as fast as they used to."   *German canned laughter*   "Oh Wlady, what am I going to do with you?"   "You can start with a warm embrace."   "Oh Wlady. Did I ever tell you you give the best hugs?"   "Yah. And so did 67 other guys."   *German canned laughter*     That was a work of art. Bravo, Fury.   I really hope this turns out to be a good one.    This photo is so old that upon seeing the total number of upvotes she received on the original post, this woman was inspired to go to school for her piloting license, began her flying career, took a few years off to raise a family, went back into the air, flew a record 25 million miles around the world, retired, watched her grandkids on the weekends, died peacefully surrounded by loved ones and is currently reincarnated as OP in a vain attempt to get more upvotes for the photo that started it all.    I don't think we have to question Donaire's abilities. I think we have to question his heart. If his heart is in it, if he's committed to the sport and to fitness, he's a top contender against any of those guys. What we've seen in recent fights is that he's just not into it like he was two or three years ago.    I love that he owns a pizza truck. That's fantastic.   Outside of that he seems to be a man of few words, but likely because English isn't his first language.    Like they say, you can't spell Klitschko with "schko."   "Yaw fyuhd." - Ahnull Schwazzaahdknandeger   I didn't know this up until a few years ago when a teammate kicked it and I, thinking the play was dead, just caught the ball and tossed it back to the other side. Imagine my surprise and disappointment.    Meh   A different time, different technology and a different sport, but something like that almost happened in the 60s to the (then) Minnesota Lakers.  http://nypost.com/2009/02/08/1960-lakers-will-never-forget-plane-crash-that-changed-their-lives/  The NBA did a really great in-depth piece on it on the 50th anniversary a few years back.   http://www.nba.com/2010/news/features/steve_aschburner/01/15/lakers.anniversary/index.html  We've seen it happen in the KHL to Lokomotiv and even at the college level with Marshall, but hopefully we never have to see it again, regardless of sport or division. Scary stuff.    Dark. Laughed, but dark. haha  	25
    First Part: https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/3djttv/the_acrolith/      **1:01am**  Ive been hiding in my my house now for just over a day and it has been quite. I think I may be safe-ish from Rufus, or *The Acrolith* for the time being. Im guessing he, or *it* doesnt know exactly where I am, but I cant imagine him giving up on me. I havent slept or let the picture out of my sight. About an hour after I got home since the incident at Moss Hill I heard sirens of all types blaring past my apartment complex. But what is bothering me the most is there is no buzz about it. Nothing on social media, nor the local news. But I found this, an Acrolith is a sculpture made from stone and other materials such as wood. So I suppose that correlates with the disgusting stone arm, and terrifying monologue.  So I suppose there are two options for me:  1.) Hide here and hope to god that thing doesnt find me, then live the rest of my life in fear  2.) Try to fight back, most likely with this picture   By reaching out on the internet Ive found that my best option is to burn the photo. Im gonna throw in some salt and whatever holy, monster killing mumbo-jumbo I can think of. But first Im gonna try and get some shut eye, but I doubt that will happen. Wish me luck     **6:23am**  I dont know if it was restful enough to be called sleep, but whatever it was I was woken up from it by an email from someone using the address  *xDrzt7n@gld.n* . Now that adress brought me no where, but the anonymous sender did. They wrote:    You cant do a single thing to him, or any of them. Surrender all memory of him and your photo and you just might survive. Good luck.  This short message is more than a lot to take in. How the hell should I feel about that? According to this stranger I can give up my memory/memories to him along with the photo and be quote unquote survive? And what does he mean by them?! Are there more demon-freaks now?! Who the hell is this guy anyway?!  I sent a reply asking for elaboration, but got nothing in return. I felt like my time was running short. I decided to risk going back to the asylum. Not inside, but around the adress to get a look. So I threw my old binoculars around my neck. But I realized I should have the photo somewhere hard to reach on my person, where it would be safe. So I slipped it into my sneaker and went to my car.     **7:02am**  Its gone. The whole fucking building is gone. There no rubble or anything, even the driveway is gone. Its just... woods now. Am I in the right place? Whats the address again? Shit my head is **not** cooperating. What is happening to me?     **7:30am**   I began to feel uncomfortable as I explored what I think is the lot. It started so faintly that I didnt even acknowledge it. But it began to grow painful, specifically in my foot. I panicked when I realized it was the foot that was in the same shoe as the photo. I almost broke my ankle tearing the shoe off in fear, but I didnt dare lose possession of the polaroid. Once the shoe was off I clamped my hand over the opening, in case rufus was nearby. Heat radiated out of my shoe like a space heater. So I plugged the hole in my shoe with a sock and threw it in my trunk.  Why the fuck is the photo hot? I dont know what to do at this point. Im going back to hiding.      **3:44pm**  He found me. For a split second my phone laptop and tv all switched to a view of my apartment complex from across the street behind. The image was looking up from a bus stop. Ive barricaded all doors and called the cops to report a break-in. Im in my bedroom with my gun (Yes I know it wont do me much good but Ill take my advantages where I can).     **3:59pm**  The building is beginning to, oh fuck I dont even know! *Morph* I guess. Its disgusting, the whole structure almost seems organic. The drywall is flowing and climbing on itself and making a horrible crackling and gurgling sound, it almost looks like its breathing. I can hear the other tenants freaking out in the rooms around mine. Its grown deeply cloudy outside and the polaroid is hot again.     **4:13pm**  Moments after the sirens arrived outside, The Acrolith finally spoke ***NO MEMORY OF ME SHALL REMAIN. I WILL CONSUME YOU. WE ARE ANCIENT*** his voice tore through my mind like bullets. Fuck this, Im so furious and terrified. Im gonna do it. Im uploading the photo for all of you to see, Then Im gonna burn it. I have no idea if this will do anything to him, but if you have the guts, please save the photo. Maybe even print it off and hide it somewhere. If its existence hurts him then I want you all to see it.  http://imgur.com/ODcPu1N   google keep   Dancing   Bingo   Nexus 5   Yeah of course! I don't know about keyboards but look up icon packs on the play store.   Plainly it's because I think it looks nice that way.   Sadly no, I used Elun and Nova launcher. Elun is 0.99 and Nova launcher is free, but themes are fun for me so I am using paid features in that app to make it look more sleek. Nova paid is 5.99. I would recommend Min icon pack with the free version of nova If you want a nice minimalistic free theme. [This is what is capable with Min](http://imgur.com/o6Sumwy)   Because these are the only apps I use   How about a battle axe to go with it where one side is an upvote, and the other side is a downvote?         You're telling me...   This makes me sad :(  I don't think people should be shamed for dancing   That is what I was thinking. From what little I've managed to find burning seems to be  my best bet.    Well it's obviously not your hardware, You're actually on better specs than I am for the most part. What I found was cranking it all down and making it the only program I was running. The slowly turning it up.   That is one way to put it.   Shoot :( what are your specs? I may be able to help isolate your performance issues. This happened to me and it sorta ended up being a pile of small things amounting to a large issue as apposed to one sole thing. I can play the game fine now.   switch to a previous version of dx in the settings tab    Part 2: https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/3dzlvu/the_acrolith_part_2/   Countless google searches have brought me here to this forum. Never used reddit before, but I guess this is where people who have had experiences like myself accumulate. Ive never had to fear for my life before, despite my line of work and I dont know what to do. Running seems pointless due to my situation and the police are of no use. I dont feel in control of my own existance anymore. I feel like I'm going to be ripped apart.  Ive worked at the Moss Hill Institute for the criminally insane for just over 2 years now. I never went to college. But when you 66, 230 lbs, and own a security guard license; its easy enough to be hired as a guard. I used to enjoy guarding, its stressful, but rewarding work. But this is NOT what guarding should involve. I should never have been put anywhere near something like that without knowing about it. I swear if I make it out of this Im suing anyone I can. Fuck Moss Hill. I wish I never worked there.   Well, I didnt always work there I used to work as a bouncer at a nightclub two towns over. When I heard about security work only about 20 minutes away, I was so deeply relieved. A job that didnt require 2 hours of driving every morning and every night. And an even better perk than a short drive was the fact that I got to work in the security room , monitoring the CCTV screens. easy-peasy. I had landed the job I was going to ride with all the way to retirement. Little did I know about the one person that would make that job hell. Rufus Baker.  Rufus Baker was not my angry boss. Nor my shitty co-worker. Rufus Baker was a patient in our mental hospital. I had heard his name at least 10 times on my first day. He was a high-profile patient kept in restraints at all times. Though no one really knew why. He had been there since he was a young adult. His origins were unknown. But we knew asking questions about Rufus was an easy way to get fired (That was in fact the reason for my position being open). He was a very thin, light skinned with thin grey hair. But, the most definitive feature of Rufus was his stoney grey eyes.  Rufus seldom stirred. And is he did stir it was to stare at a different part of his pale blue room. He looked at the wall as if he could see straight through them, to all corners of the building. When switching through the screens, I always seemed to come back to Rufus. He was our only patient kept in high security at all times, but in comparison to some of the other patients, he was completely harmless. Twice a day two people would come in and feed him and a Doctor would look at him and a little screen next to his bed, then write stuff on his clipboard and leave. Watching him was completely mundane and boring, but I couldnt stop. I had always been into mystery novels and the horror genre. So trying to figure him and some of the other interesting patients out was a lot of fun for me.   Things began to change when I had done a routine check of all the cameras and went back to Rufus to see if he had changed positions. He had not. Bored with the cams I decided to try and draw Rufus (Im no artist, but doodling kills time). I pulled out my sticky notes and drowsily reached for a ball point pen to my right. I tried to pinch it between my fingers, but I realized there was no pen to grab. It was now about 5 inches from where I had originally saw it. Puzzled, I grasped at the pen again, it then skittered like a bug across the entire width of my desk, and fell down between the frame and the wall. I sat there for who knows how long in complete awe. I looked around for any sources to the pens movement, but found nothing. To make it even worse I couldnt reach the pen now because the desk was built into the floor.   I sat back down and laughed it off. I opened my desk and reached for a new box of pens and popped it open. Luckily these put up no fight I turned towards my sticky notes and scrawled on the top one was  ***DONT*** . Similarly to the pen incident, I searched for a source to the note, and found nothing. Due to my usual choice of media, I have a tendency to jump to conclusions and freak myself out. I calmed my senses and began to think rationally. This was a prank, it had to be. I shook it off thinking I would discover the source later.  And I did discover the source, but sooner rather than later. On screen was Rufus, looking straight at me. I felt shivers run down my spine and goose bump crawl down my arms. I got up and swiftly backed away from the screen. His stony eyes followed me the whole time as if we were in the same room. Very unsure of the situation, I fled the room to take a much needed coffee break. I had to clear my head, and get away from the screens. I thought it couldnt have been real, I was just sleep deprived. Or maybe I had too much to drink the day before? When I returned, I didnt switch back to rufus for the rest of the evening.  I was nervous to go to work the next morning. I actually had the phone in my hand at one point to call in sick, but I was also excited that something was finally happening with rufus. I finally felt like I was in a mystery novel. Ive spent my entire time at Moss Hill trying to figure Rufus out, and now I was starting to know why. But when I got to work I didnt even look at Rufuss cam until 4 hours in. And when I did he was just sitting there, as usual, like a statue. I was deeply discouraged, But something caught my eye, in the corner of his cell, were a pile of pens. My pens. All of my Pens were gone! I promptly got up, and let my boss know I was going home sick.  I didnt return to work for a few days. I instead used my time to try and figure out what to do about the whole situation Being a very superstitious person. I decided that it was most likely safer find a job as a mall cop, but I would regret dropping it for the rest of my life. So I did some research, and it came down to either I was crazy, or he had some form of telekinetic power. And he must not want his image recorded, at least on paper (I assumed this because he seemed to leave the video recordings alone). I wouldnt resort to telling my superiors about this yet, because when people get involved with him, usually results in their termination.  I brought a new pack of pens with me and an old polaroid camera, to test my theory of him not wanting to be on paper. I didnt let my bag containing my pens and camera out of my sight until I was ready to try it. I tried the pens first. I got a hold of them fine, they put up no fight. I started to circle back to my assumption that I was crazy until I discovered that I couldn't get a drop of ink out of any of them. This surprisingly made me excited. I reached down for the camera with shaky hands. As I aimed the viewfinder at the screen I saw Rufus slowly crane his neck in my direction (Or at least the direction of the camera in his cell). My heart was now beating like bass drum. I snapped the picture.  Almost instantly Rufus did something I don't think anyone has ever seen him do. He stood up. Not like how you think someone who has spent their life in bed would stand up either. He stood up swiftly in a single motion, pulling through his restraints like they were fashioned out of pipe cleaners and paper mache. All lights in the building began to flicker and dim. The building seemed to shake. Not shake like earthquake style, but like jiggling jello. It was like all of reality seemed to tremble. Everyone on the CCTVs seemed to react too. A deep voice rang in my head and shook my body to its core. ***I AM THE ACROLITH. BEFORE THERE WAS LIFE THERE WAS STONE. BEFORE THERE WAS STONE THERE WAS ME*** He jutted his arm out to the side in a violent manner, his stony eyes seemed to emit a deep, grey light. On one of the cams I saw something that straight out of a nightmare. A patient in the cafeteria began to grab at his torso like he had a bomb inside of him. Suddenly a giant, malformed, stone and wooden arm burst from his chest cavity.  The arm fluently grabbed another patient and threw him at a group of tables with incredible force. The poor man with the abomination jutting out of his chest collapsed to the ground and the arm went limp. ***YOU WILL NOT REMEMBER ME. I WILL CONSUME YOU*** I could now see that everyone heard and felt the voice. Patients and guards alike were holding their head on all of the video feeds. You could feel the presence of Rufus all throughout the building. It was like being in a sauna and having someone with a hot wet towel wrapped around your neck. I felt fatigue grip my whole body and I collapsed to my knees, then puked up what little I had eaten. When my senses returned I ran from the asylum faster than I thought possible.  So now here I sit at home on my little laptop holding my gun as closely as I can. 911 dispatch keeps brushing me off as a prank call, and I think Im going to die. But there is one thing I have that gives me confidence. I have a picture of him, and Im going to try and figure out why he doesn't want me to have it.   I... think that... this guy doesn't... understand how to... use... ellipses       Resubmitting because no one saw my last post and I really need help  I have a 500gb HDD in my Gaming PC I built a while back.

 I appreciate it, I'll check this one out.    In the mood to watch a few movies, give me some input.  Dallas Buyers Club, Les Misrables, Argo, or Gravity    Simply just think it is a beautiful movie. The cinematography is phenomenal as well as the acting. Also love how it is about everything, such as knowing your place in the world, how others view you, what an ego can do, and mostly love how it explains what is flawed about modern blockbusters and movie goers and how most Michael Bay type explosion extravaganzas are just pointless cash grab, but Birdman really is a piece of art in my opinion that I have been waiting a long time to see. Hopefully that answered your question!   1. Birdman 2. The Departed  3. Pulp Fiction  4. Taxi Driver  5. Se7en   "This item is only available through special promotions or events."   Zodiac. Great film, David Fincher is a superb director and the movie was filmed beautifully. Also, the basement scene...holy shit.   "Oops" -127 Hours    My personal favorites are Pulp Fiction, Dazed and Confused, Guardians of the Galaxy, and Django Unchained.    Yes. I just think he has potential that was seen in Fury.      I like the Pixar movie "Cars". It's not my favorite Pixar movie of all time but I definitely do not think it is shit or isn't up to par on Pixar's usual films. I thought the movie was about much more than just winning a big race. To me it was about a full of himself race car who discovers how to be humble, grateful, and makes some quality friendships that he never would have made prior to his entering of Radiator Springs. That's just my opinion on the movie I simply want to know why some people don't care for it. Cars 2 was shit though.   It bothers me a lot when it is used an excessive amount. If you see Ted 2, there is an obscene amount of product placement in that movie.    Guardians of the Galaxy = The Unusual Interplanetary Attacking Team   Good Will Hunting.   The Revenant.    How's it like working with Quentin Tarantino, and are you excited for Hateful Eight to be released?    Actors (excluding Leo we all know), directors, cinematographers, make-up artists, etc.   I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. It kept me entertained from start to finish and the last thirty minutes of the movie felt like authentic Jurassic Park and it had the best ending I could have possibly hoped for. I had no problems with the acting, at some points the CGI looked a little cheesy but still did not take away from the film in my opinion. Were there some flaws? Yes. In the grand scheme of things did I think it was a solid action movie that excited me almost as much as Jurassic Park? Absolutely.    Wow this is really cool! Thank you.    Thank you.  	20

 Thank you.  You, my friend, are on the level.   How would I tell?  A lithograph would have indentations, right?  Any other telltale signs?   Thank you.  For real.   Hah, got it, needed a tiny Alan wrench.  http://imgur.com/Y2HKQwx  Nothing!  Wha...?   See the second picture I posted.    I have no idea how to remove the backing without busting the glass.  Should I just bust it?   If only the gnomes were in a more Gravity Falls style...http://imgur.com/pMd9hNr   Holy crap.  My brain did not even go that direction with it.  It was custom framed.  I've never seen a frame like this.  Apparently, the framer didn't want their name attached. http://imgur.com/Wkz8uIA      I have had sleep paralysis issues for nine years now. Typically, the dreams that end with the paralysis involve something horrifying (being thrown around a room or stalked by something unseen).  Those suck.  Three nights ago, I had the first one in two years.  It was a dream within a dream within a dream.  I remember waking up twice only to find that it wasn't quite over.  I felt my hand sting.  Then it started to really hurt.  I was on my back, so I pulled my hand to my line of sight.  Expecting a cramp or my hand to have been asleep, I peered down towards my hand to find a deformed, hairless head with its mouth wrapped around my hand, up to my thumb. The body wasn't visible, and I can still remember the expressions it was making while it chomped down.  Then the paralysis!  Finally, I woke up with a yelp.  A literal yelp.  I had fallen asleep with a paintbrush in hand.  I had clenched so tightly onto it in my sleep that my hand cramped.  Weird.  	9
    That is pretty cool    Sorry, that would make sense. My parents came back from overseas and bought me a back a t shirt. They still left the magnetic security tag on it so I was wondering where to get a magnet capable of releasing the tag.    Hey I know this is an old thread but would that be a decent place to discuss getting into that sort of thing. I want to do some game dev, even as a fun hobby but it's very overwhelming when you look up how to start this. Some first hand experience would be cool to talk to    Hey bit of a random request but does anyone know where I could buy a magnet from in Newcastle.   I am using a 1Tb WD Passport external hard drive and my OS is windows 7 64bit. My hd will be registered by the computer, i will be able to safely remove ect. However in Windows Explorer the device will show up but not under its proper name and as soon as I click on it Windows Explorer crashes. When i open the computer management tool and click on disk management it freezes until I pull the hard drive then everything works perfectly again. Same with disk defragmenter. Is there a way I can fix this hard drive without reformatting it or a way I can recover the 500Gb of data off it and then reformat or throw the friggin thing away?  Any help is greatly appreciated.   It was done as a joke. The bloke with the ball (Willie Mason) use to play for the Knights (white red and blue team).  Bit of harmless on field shenanigans.    Yeah cheers for that. I might head there tomorrow and see what he can do.   I haven't removed it from the enclosure but I did swap the connector. The issue is that the computer registers that the drive has been plugged into it, I can safely remove hardware ect, but windows explorer cannot open the drive nor can I use any of the data. So I figured a reformat is in order however there is a solid 600Gb of content that I really dont want to lose.  Cheers for the suggestion however I might give them a look.   Damn. It's a frustrating problem hey because you can't just get in and defrag it or something.   If I find a solution I'll post back with the details.   My external hard drive has stopped being able to be read from any of my computers and there are alot of Movies and TV shows (legally bought of course)  that I would like back.   Does anyone know of a good data recovery place that could get everything back from drive or even transfer the data to a fresh non munted hard drive?   Give Adamstown and Kotara a look as well. Decent affordability and they are smack bang in the middle the 2 main shopping centres. Plus only 15 Min drive from the beach.    Yeah the new ANZAC walk near bar Beach is unreal. Such an amazing view.       Ha saw that at work today. Classic. That building is a leak hazard    One overall touristy post about all the things to do in newy so we can eliminate the constant "hey travelling or moving up to Sydney, what are some cool things to do" posts.    I am so so glad that you posted this. I'm glad someone else is as worried about the thought of this stupid policy getting through. I don't think people understand how much of a violation it is.   I will absolutely sign this see what other actions can be taken.   	17
 Note: This is a short, spoopy story that my 13 year old sister wrote and gave me permission to share. It's her first story and she's aspiring to be a writer when she gets out of school o3o.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  I hear a strange, blaring noise intrude it's way into my still-unconscious mind,it's only as my mind begins to wake, do my ears register the noise as my alarm clock.   Panic floods my body as I look at the clock and it's still screaming alarm. 7:30, I slept in.  I put on the clothes from last night, and rush downstairs to get something to eat, something quick or I'll be late for school.   "Good morning, honey!" A voice greets as I fumble down the stairs and rush through the living room and into the kitchen.   "Good morning mom"  I call back.   I grab a pack of cherry poptarts, grab my backpack and rush out the front door, bursting through it, just in time to barely catch the school bus as it's pulling away from the stop next to my house.   I drone my way through another day of school and catch the bus back home at the end of the day.   "Welcome home, honey!" My mothers voice greeted as a walked through the door.   "Hi" I reply before retreating up the stairs.   I do my homework and play a few hours of video games before bed, ignoring my mothers new and horrid taste in music that she's blaring as I do.   I jump in the shower and get ready for bed around 10pm, when my cellphone rings.   "Hello?" I answer  "Charlene?" the womans voice replies from the other end "I just wanted to let you know that your father and I are coming home early and will be back tomorrow morning"   I don't answer my mother as my eyes dart towards my door, my name is called from the hallway. Whatever is standing in front of my door, it's not my mother.    As far as I know, just bad housing market. The house is at the very end of a long dead end road and away from pretty much everything. So probably not a very good location for a lot of people.   I don't particularly like the location either, but the house was a cheap sale xD.   So, I recently moved into a new house, after my old house flooded due to a faulty water pipe, which my landlord refused to fix.   Anyway, it's a nice house, was well kept, despite having been empty for almost 10 years, and it has a nice, big fenced in yard for my dog, so, win-win.   I've been here about two months, but for the last month, some weird shit has been going on.   I've been plagued by weird dreams, not really scary, just bizarre. I'm no stranger to weird dreams, but these are really weird.   The one I had two nights ago was the weirdest. In the dream, I'm standing out in the woods, and there's this little boy standing behind a tree in front of me and he looks at me and says "we're always watching". It wasn't a scary dream by any sense, the best I can describe as being kinda hazy, like I was shrouded in fog. I also woke up very tired, like I'd been walking all night.   Both myself and my dog have heard things like pattering footsteps running across the hard wood floor in the dining room/kitchen(it's one big room separated by a center island table), or thumping up in the "attic", there is no attic really, it's just beams.   My dog is a very easy going dog, she's 6 years old and has *never* growled a day in her life. But when we first moved in, she would plant herself at the bottom of the stairs doing upstairs and growl.    Not a terrifying turn of events, but definitely weird.    There is more proof that something still exists after you die than there is that you go to heaven. There is *no* proof of God, beyond a book and what Christians say, I've never seen God.   Did I offend a poor little God person? =(   DEMON!  Dude, that's a stick  DEMON!  Dude...that's a dog   DEMON!  Dude! that's my girlfri-....nevermind, carry on.  Girlfriend: -_-   LOL this made me laugh harder than it should have.   "We believe the voice in the recording is saying "I'll kill your soul"  *What the ghost is actually saying*  "Have you seen my nacho cheese?"   Oh, we don't like Douchey Baganses, precious. No we don't.  But seriously, he's a pompous asshat who treats his "friends" like shit.    From what I've heard, he's also pretty much a fukwad to his fans too when he meets them.    Did you not see the part where I said I didn't know where to put it? =D  Maybe instead of saying "EHHHHHH IT NOT PARANORM!" You could have been like "hey, put this here =D"   Well, that's what happens when you're a violent paranoid Schizophrenic.  People tend to take you away.    	9
 I hate this too. Maybe some people assume that the theater is going to fill up anyway. They "don't see" the empty spaces - it doesn't factor into their decision making -  and instead just focus on where they want to sit. If that place is next to someone else... Even if it's *right next to them...* that's where they'll sit.   I was just wondering about this last night. Chrome was closed and yet because of having so many instances it was still the most resource-intensive thing running on the computer.   You're exactly right. The reason they push those specs are because management won't sign off on buying anything without them. It's the language that the rules are written in.  Another thing is that just because it can pass, say, a drop test does not mean that it *will* withstand a drop. Or a slide on concrete. Or having a heavy toolbox set on top if it.   How was this an appropriate response? The thread went,  "What are all these flowers for?"  "People died. This is their memorial."  "Dude check out the rack on the florist."   Deadly. I wonder if they'll figure it out now.   Whew you guys are obviously great for each other.  If there was one thing I would change about this it would definitely be to take out about 100 commas.   When I was a sophomore in high school I bussed tables and did prep work for a restaurant in a small coastal town. The restaurant was in what they called a"downtown" which was a little strip of restaurants, bars and knick-knack tourist shops that went along a river. I worked there with another hostess named Lisa for a few months and then she left. She didn't quit, she just didn't come to work anymore.  About a year ago, I saw Lisa again. I was 24 and bartending two blocks down the street from the restaurant we worked at. She didn't look the same. She was older, more beautiful. She looked put-together. Her makeup was bold but perfect, not a hair out of place.  Something about her, maybe her eyes or the way she puckered her lips to take a drink... I could barely look away. I don't remember anything from the last hour of my shift except that when she tried to pay for a drink, the bills she pulled from her bra were damp and slick.  She waited without making me ask while I cleaned the bar. Teddy said he'd take care of the tills and we left.  Lisa was terrible at walking in heels. Slow, and lilting, it looked like it was her first time. I held her up and kept her from falling over. I could feel a gym body through her clothes and I couldn't say whether it was me or her that was sweating.  She took a sudden right turn away from the main street that threw me off guard. Toward the pier and the river.  "Where are you going?" I asked.  "I want to see the water," she said. "Walk with me?"  We walked next to the sail and fishing boats on the pier. She led me to the unstable floating walkway that went under the pier. I stopped and she pulled away.  "Hey, come on," I said. "Let's go home."  "Just a little more," she said and she didn't look back. The last thing I saw of her was that lilted, tottering walk as she slipped into the darkness under the wooden, barnacled pier.  I waited for her. I couldn't bring myself to leave the lighted area though. Every time I'd set so much as a toe into the dark, the hairs on my neck would stand up. I must have sat for fifteen minutes arguing with myself. I never heard her or anyone for that matter.  In the end, I just left.  I thought that was it. Sometimes I honestly had to wonder whether it even really happened at all.  I left that town to finally go to college. Better late than never, right?  Anyway, last night I got a text from one of my old bartender buddies, Jesse. He asked if I knew this girl and sent me a blurry picture of Lisa. This morning his girlfriend asked if I'd seen or heard from him. She said he just disappeared last night.  Tell me it's all in my head. Make me feel okay.   Oof. Really left me hanging.  Also, "stoo it?" Should that be "Stop it?"      That's not even really creepy or scary... It just makes me mad.   I think they were talking more about people negotiating raises than the PB.   As long as they're of age.   That was cute.   That's what I mean, though. If a burp is air escaping, then why is there so much air just sitting there. If I do jumping jacks is all of that just splashing around? It doesn't look right to me unless they inflated the stomach to get a better view with the camera.   [Hm...](http://img.pandawhale.com/64932-That-doesnt-make-any-sense--Pa-p7m4.gif)   Someone needs to teach ~~her~~ it a lesson.   How do you feel about /u/AWildSketchAppeared?   Oh my god 10/10 for the boobs alone.   What are the top three things that happened or that you did today?   In saying, "I reddit," I wonder what the best scenario you pictured happening was.   I'll have you know that on mobile I got that in one try.   This is it. Taste drives creativity. How many times have you complained that the ending of this sucked or that they could have done ___ better? So do it better.   I can't even think of another way to interpret that...   Maybe the two phones should just commit, have a baby, and finally make everyone happy at once.      I can hear it. She's in the house. I'm hiding in my closet and *oh Jesus she won't stop.*  Eric.Harris.rocks.my.world.   You managed to write all that without calling them killer whales. Might have even been Bundy whales or Voorhees whales with,  for their livers.   Oh you're everywhere.   I definitely approve of the method. Any cheap, scratch notebook recommendations?   To go with the idea of context being important, what about Jesse's "bitch?"  Yeah, he overuses it, but you still feel it when he's angry or happy. It doesn't detract from anything (in my opinion) because it seems realistic.   For a quick 'n dirty (and free) method, you could use Evernote. I'm not sure what kind of notes you have, but EN allows you to use a search function with your hand-written notes. It's cloud-based, mobile-friendly and versatile. You'll need a decent camera, but any smart phone from the last few years should do.   I like "anchor points." It's sometimes frustrating when something is written for one reason but readers interpret it differently, or don't seem get it at all. But you can't control everything like that. Maybe the reader isn't set up to be receptive to some ideas. Then again, maybe they're seeing things and making connections in your words that even you're not. You should "write for yourself" but putting it out there is still a bit of a vulnerable process.   I like the idea of anchor points, though. As a reader, I look for those especially near the beginning. At some point near the middle or end, I usually have my mind made up. The ship is sailed, so to speak.   I personally love stories that wander. They live in realism and because of that they leave loose ends, characters and narrators are just plain wrong and the ending should never come but does eventually.  But not on nosleep. Not so much. There isn't time. I don't know or trust most of the writers here to pull that off.   Another thing to think about, the big question(s) of writing a story: **why?**  Why are you writing this story? What's the point of it? What are you trying to communicate?  And as far as I've thought about it, it's either a feeling or an idea. Nosleep praises feelings and sees idea stories as cheap, no matter how prettily they're wrapped. (Of course there are exceptions to every rule.)  So then every part, paragraph, sentence and word in a story should support that big thing somehow. Don't waste. Don't wander aimlessly. If you've got nothing to say, readers will know it.  Everything is true, right? So be honest in your writing. Say what you mean and tell it as well as you can. That's what makes a story good and that's why someone will listen.   Red flag.   I don't really know what I'd use it for. I adore that website's description though.  Sometimes, we just want our shit as orange as possible.   Heh. '69.   I saw them so clearly that at first it didn't occur to me that no one else had. A man, bending at the waist so as to speak over the hum of the crowd into the ear of the boy next to him. A boy, obviously crying, with his face drawn into a frown and his pleading eyes searching aimlessly. Most bizarrely of all though, from his limp hands hung a rifle.  It would have made a decent movie poster. Maybe one of those cardboard cutouts that come out with the newest summer blockbuster or video game release. There was a lot of emotion in that tiny scene across the food court.   A picture says a thousand words, and this one told a story that was so at odds with the rest of the Saturday afternoon mall scene that I thought I must have been mistaken. I'm still in shock that I was the first one, the *only* one to see it. There were people closer than me. What was wrong with them? Why wasn't anyone else screaming?  The man sort of lifted the rifle for the boy, put his hand in the proper place, but you could tell that the youngster was used to shooting. He stuck his nose up against the slide and drew the stock tightly into his shoulder. He looked comfortable, but his face was still so afraid.  The man was still talking to him. Egging him on. Those searching eyes found mine and the world stood still.  Then everything was pain noise.  Looking back I think about those poor people. The ones who didn't make it. And it's tragic, it's terrible. It actually *hurts*  to know that they died.  But then, some other small voice keeps asking the question...  Why didn't they see them standing there? Why didn't they notice? Why was it only me? What was wrong with them?   [She's missed you too.](http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2011/01/30/article-1351959-0CF9E029000005DC-396_468x727.jpg)   The center part is a turnbuckle. Holding both of the hooks in place and turning that middle piece will tighten both screws because of the reversed threads (on the left hook). If both hooks were attached to cables, it could be used to adjust tension on them.  As for the wood frame... I'm not exactly sure.   Why not make it a [threesome?](http://www.rationalitynow.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/633619816658263170-ceationism2.jpg)   https://www.reddit.com/r/KeepWriting/wiki/relatedlinks here's a list I made a while ago.   More nutty than ballsy.   I just want to take my laptop to the Chinese buffet and watch movies too. I feel like I'd get in trouble for some reason...   The over-exposure makes me feel for you. The world is too bright!   X-acto knife or box cutter.   So you're going to take pages out of your notebooks to put in the binders? Will you hole punch them?  And in the last sentence you said you're looking for a notebook that's compact like a notebook. Is that what you meant?   You should come back at night when he's sitting in the chair.   Sorry I thought you were responding to the other comment.  You're right, I made up the weights and tensions. It still didn't launch them like it normally would (not a "full launch").   Depends on which country's edition you're playing.   Yeah that's... exactly what I said.  Edit: In my other comment. Obviously the numbers used here were rough estimates.   You can tell that it's made up because of the way that it is.   Thanks! I was really hoping you'd come back to it.  I think I'd have problems writing that too (and a few other things). I don't know if that makes it difficult to write about or just seldom worth it.   Any time, the same thing applies. Having one strap pull the cage up or side-to-side isn't so scary since all your potential pulling power is in those straps and you just lost half. The only real way you might run into trouble is if it broke right when you reached the top, in which case you'd have gravity working against you.  But it's also not true what you said about unpredictability. You can at least say that the bands are most likely to break at their maximum strain, which is when they're stretched at launch. After that point, they'll have less and less strain on them and will be less likely to break because of that.  So at the top of the arc, where things are the most dangerous, you just proved that the strap can hold at a higher tension a few seconds before. Since you lose momentum fighting gravity, the stress on them is lower now.  I guess you can't guarantee that it would never happen, but I think it's safe to say that most strap breaks would happen on the ground or just upon takeoff.   I don't think flair is a good way of going about this. You might, *at best*, end up with a style like /r/writingprompts. It would look complicated and confusing, it would be hard to implement for the (how many millions now?) people to post, enforcement would put a serious strain on the volunteer mods.  And that's just the *how* of it. The *what* was organizing stories by "genre." I personally can't see that being a good thing at all. All the stories on nosleep are true. You don't think that's going to detract from the realism if next to the title it says "vampire," "ghosts," or "bigfoot?" Half the stories here have some kind of twist. Sorting things into genres couldn't help that.  The thing is, nosleep stories already are a subsection of horror writing, and nosleep isn't a catch-all. It's actually pretty specific as far as writing subs go.  I'd like to hear your thoughts though. What did you have in mind?   As others have said, glue or otherwise attach a mini printed sheet to one of the pages.   full power launch  Nope. If you have 1000 pounds of lifting force with two bands, acting on a 500 pound cage and one band breaks, the thing isn't going anywhere.   Endings are hard and most of the time they're at least a little disappointing. What had the best first half even if the ending wasn't perfect?  Ninja edit: I'm mostly asking from a story or main plot point of view. Anything is good though.   What couldn't/can't you write in a story and why?   M real good at ritin.   And by that I mean that I can sound out most words in my vocabulary.   Not enough CGI.   You're doing yourself a disservice to leave out Spartacus as well.   Yeah, you're not supposed to drink it (#4).   Yeah I'm surprised no one mentioned that yet. Towels are really invaluable.   You've got a lot of restraint to keep Grognak and not read it.   Whoah, where did you spend the other $5,994,000? :)   And it's almost *never* fruits and vegetables.   Captive audience. Nice.   "Well you know, people can write whatever they want. I don't think that David Bowie..."  "Yeah but it rhymes."   Yeah, man! In the 70's they said an ice age was coming, now it's global warming. What'll they say next? /s   But it's just the kind of thing you'd expect their lawyers to do.   Yissssss   Coming soon to Skymall...   I think it's a fine path. You don't need to feel inadequate over this.   This was my first thought too. Everyone knows (or has known) at least one person. They stop caring, too. So you have a pulse? Let me tell you about whatever. Don't have a pulse? Even better; you can't get away.   Maybe there's a way to connect to their wifi from your house.   The O.B. stands for O.B.G.Y.N.  ... naw, that can't be right.   Kind of like in the Matrix? Neo gets the phone and it immediately rings with instructions on how to get out of the building.   Almost a good link there. Something's not working with the second parentheses.   With a grabber claw.   Is that dog even alive?  **Just kidding, Chuck Testa!**   Read that as ball hair pulling jealousy. There's not much else to say.   That's it! What are rubber buns though?   There's one I remember from the playground that ended with something something rubber buns and liquor (rub her buns and lick her) but I don't remember the joke and it didn't make sense at the time. I just remember rubber buns and liquor from time to time.  Does anyone know the joke? Do you have any jokes like this?   In the car works too... Not with headphones though.   I still can't listen to music with headphones on because I'll think i hear someone calling my name. It's been 7 years since I lived with my parents.   Directions unclear. Dick stuck in hood ornament.   Clevah gahl.   At retail and service jobs you've got to consider who you're actually talking to and following up with. A shift supervisor isn't making hiring decisions, but they might be the highest ranking person in the store at a given time and they might try to answer your questions.  It might seem obvious, but I can tell you that many young people don't know this. When I was a supervisor, I'd tell people they needed to call or visit during the few hours that the owner was actually present since they did the hiring... Most didn't.   What kind of book is that? Make sure you hide it well.  *Yeesh.*   /r/nottheonion   Good on you, glad to hear it.   Do you think maybe your friends are taking advantage of you?   Officials said they were investigating why wardens had failed to give Mr Barry a third ticket.  I know that it's totally suspicious, but I cracked up at this.  Warden: "Boss, I found someone dead in a double parked car."  Boss: "Well, did you give them a ticket?"  W: "N-no. They were dead and I didn't know what to do so I called you."  B: "Here's what you do: Nothing. We're turning this over to morning shift. But if I find out you didn't write that stiff a ticket so help me God we'll bury you along with them."  RIP warden.

"Are you saying he's ''aving a stroke' or *'having a stroke?'*"   You can tell that it's maple because of the way that it is!   The obvious middle ground between your comment and Neutral Good Andrew is picking exactly *which* details to describe. More is not always better, but you should have some.  You could go on and on about how Harry's hair was wild, but when you say he woke up and shook a spider from his hair, you can picture that. It sets up the whole image of the cupboard under the stairs in only a few words.   Morbid Mel  The bell sat high above campus in its tower and it tolled for Mel. Mel was late for a class he was going to fail. The only reason he had for going at all was to sit near Deb, whom he was fond of and who didn't know Mel's name.  Mel pleaded with his eyes for the bell to slow its toll. As he looked up, he wondered how long it would take a body to strike the ground once they'd leapt from the top of the tower.  "Less than 3 seconds, I suppose," said a man walking in the opposite direction of Mel.  Before Mel could turn and speak, the man was away down the sidewalk, too far to hear Mel's stuttered reply.  As the professor droned on about the theory of gravity, between admiring looks at the back of Deb's head, Mel stared down at his hands and wrists and pretended to take notes. He wondered idly how deep the ulnar artery was under the skin.  "5 millimeters," the pale, redheaded boy next to him said. "Not far."  Mel stared at the boy, then back to his wrist. *5 millimeters?*  "You're on the wrong page. The chapter we're on -- Gravity -- t's a few more pages ahead in the book. Sorry, you looked lost."  "Mm, thanks," Mel said.  ---  Thirty years later Mel's son, Bill found himself stuck in traffic. Ahead, an accident had blocked every lane of the highway. A curious thought came into Bill's bored brain. He wondered how long the human body could live after it had been cut in half at the waist.  "3-5 minutes," his phone told him after quickly typing it into the search field.    Groundbreaking.   I don't get it. SOMEONE DO MY THOUGHTS FOR ME!   *Daaaaaaad!* Get **OFF!**   Obviously. OP had to come from somewhere.   Anything can still work if it's done well. I still like Shutter Island even though it basically uses this trope.   Whoah, that's a heavy plot. Thanks   What movie is this?   The bottles weren't empty, right? If you had been drunk, you'd have still been found out. If you weren't, then yeah let's not have that factor in at all.   For my friend, /u/nosleepfinder-butler.   There was no night light in the nursery. Not anymore. Three scared children no longer lived there.  William tugged the end of the coarse rope stretching into darkness and the dead weight plowed through the soft damp pine needles of the forest floor. His progress had slowed, but he estimated that he'd come several miles from the house. Sweat mixed with misty rain and ran into his stinging eyes. He juggled the lantern from the crook of one elbow to the other. The body at the end, strung by the neck, lay outside its weak glow.  His soggy oxfords, sleek black and polished to perfection only this morning, slipped in the mud and he fell. He lay still for a moment, letting his physical and emotional exhaustion overcome him. William was far from a physical man. His strengths of protocol, organization and above all perfect poise had served him well as the family's butler for many years bringing him happiness and station. This wretched day he wished he could give it all back to feel only a little less pain now.  It had been early morning. William had left his quarters, his appearance perfectly attended to, and briskly crossed the grounds to the manor. A great deal should have to have been done before the children woke. Their meals should be made, clothes inspected and set out for them to change into, he would ensure that the tutor's lessons were in order. These were on top of the duties that the house normally required. As a butler, his duty to manage the other members of the staff and see everything attended to. A staff he found strangely absent.  William had found Jessica, the cook first. She was lying in the middle of the cigar lounge, a puddle of white vomit on the bear skin rug near her face. The vessels had popped in her eyes, dying them crimson. Mary, the childrens' tutor, had fallen down the stairs. He found her near the bottom, limbs contorted at awful angles. He had to step over her broken body to climb the stairs to the nursery.  At the top of the stairs, his knees buckled beneath him. There was no light on in the nursery.  Of course he'd had to go in. Had to see what had happened for himself.   Every night as he tucked the children into bed, he set a night light out for the youngest. Someone had come in during the night and smashed the lantern onto the floor. The whole room was ash and charcoal. He left their little bones asleep on their beds.  He'd searched the grounds all day for signs of strangers. Finally, near sunset he'd come upon a man in the garden shed. He felt sure that the man looked familiar.  The petite butler managed to wrestle him to the ground and bash his head with a mallet. He felt sure that the perpetrator wasn't dead and so he'd taken a length of rope and tied it around the man's neck. All he knew was that he wanted to take the man to be as far from the children as he could.  William picked himself up out of the mud and found the rope again. This was the spot; he could go no further. He followed the rope, lantern held out in front of him. It was even longer than he'd realized. It snaked along the ground through bushes and shrubs, at times disappearing under the pooling rainwater.  Then he came to the other end. An empty knot sat half-sunk in the needles. William picked it up and placed it over his head and tightened the knot, then threw the rest of the rope over a sturdy branch.  They say that sometimes, on rainy nights you can still see a small light on in the nursery. You can smell smoke in the air. They say if you watch it all night that just before the dawn, you can see the light being blown out.   Thought that I was in /r/jokes. Really sweet punchline.   Atom bombs, I suppose. Like those gray, black and white pictures of the Enola Gay and Bockscar with smiling crews. They destroyed 5 square miles of city. The town I grew up in was 4.9 square miles.  What a weird world to live in.   Oh, /u/the_itch.  Wait.   Thirteen days in and I had yet to *really* sleep. Dawn and dusk bled into each other, just beautiful backdrops for the next drive-thru menu. Between jobs, I ate in my car. I wanted to go inside, but I also didn't want anyone to see me. Without a shower or fresh clothes or even a razor, it was hard to stay on top of things. So I'd order through a speaker box, the nameless person would accept my payment and into the anonymity of the twilight I would disappear, soggy-soaked bag on top of the pile of other soggy-soaked corpses in my passenger seat.  The absence of face-to-face interaction was common to my new job as well. Private contractor. I rented a space in a call center and said whatever they told me to.   "Set your own hours" they said, but I don't think that they could have anticipated what that would mean when I lost my boyfriend and my apartment. With nothing to do and less than no money to get by on, I spent all day there. I averaged 21 hours a day the first week. I didn't bother counting after that.  I was good at it, I guess. During the day I'd field calls from lonely people considering suicide. At night they were lonely people too poor or scared to pay for a hooker. The formula was simple. The longer you have someone on the line, the more you make. Just keep them talking. If someone climaxed or flat-lined they'd end the conversation.  I comforted old women as they cried themselves to sleep and an old man who called me Betsy after his deceased wife. That one climaxed early. I tantalized middle aged fathers of four and curled the toes of a shy 18-year-old.   That's probably why I was so good at it. I wasn't afraid to play a part. Whatever they wanted, I became. Never mind what the judgmental blonde at Wendy's thought of me, as long as I was hidden behind miles of electrical wire, I was perfect.  And then day 13 came. I know that it was day 13 because I was supposed to get a paycheck after two weeks.  The call started out normal enough. I didn't have to try hard to get him to open up to me. He said he liked the way women smelled. I told him that I'd just gone for a jog. He said he'd like me to sit on his face. I told him I'd sit on his lap until I got to know him a little better.  I could hear him moving around. Squirming, breathing harder. Some more practiced conversation and he sounded like a pantingt wolf. He was an easy client - if I were trying to get off quick. I threw him a curve ball.  "What's your team?"  "My team?" he asked, confused.   "Yeah. Your team. I mean, I can't be *getting involved* with a Yankee's fan or something."  "Baseball? Oh, I'm a Pirates fan."  "Really? Me too!"  Now, it sounds clich: baseball to take his mind off of sex. But it's playful and it works. Yes, I would have said that any team was my favorite. It makes them feel more like they're talking to a "real" woman they know instead of just someone pretending. Having an opinion, even a small one, makes you easier to relate to. It's something I picked up from the suicide side of things.  But in this case, I hadn't even had to pretend. I'd lived outside of Pittsburgh until I was 9 with my dad. Some of my best early memories are of going to Pirates games with him. I even had their bumper sticker on my car.  We got back to business, me trailing him, giving him just enough to keep wanting more. Then he asked something unexpected.  "What kind of car do you drive?"  I didn't have a rehearsed answer to this, nor could I think of any benefit of lying, so I told him the truth.  "A Ford Focus."  He didn't say anything for a little while and I had to ask if he was still there.  "The girl I like drives a Focus."  "Oh really? Well maybe that's your type."  "She never looks at me. God, she doesn't even know I exist."  And just like that the mood had shifted from night to day. We'd been talking for almost an hour. With the mood gone, the conversation wound down. I'd lost it. Fuck it, I was tired.  "And I hate my bullshit job! Some days I think I'll just end it. I'll just walk out and finish everything."  "Now don't say that. We're still friends aren't we?"  "I wish I really knew you," he said sentimentally.  "Me too," I said eyeing the clock.  "Maybe you'll see me next time," he said and hung up.  I took few more calls, but my heart wasn't in it. I decided that I should go and take a break. I'd already be getting a nice paycheck the next day, maybe enough to get into a cheap room, and could probably do with a few hours of sleep. I'd just get some junk food first.  I didn't notice right away. I got all the way to Wendy's first. A police cruiser was in the parking lot with its lights on. I drove up to the ordering box and started feeling around for my wallet. My hand found something like a pillow wrapped in plastic.  When I looked down onto the floor of the back seat, I saw him staring back up at me. Blank, purposeless eyes looking through a plastic bag wet with condensation. His gray skin and blue lips limp and dumb-looking. Outside the car, I screamed and my stomach heaved. A police officer starting walking over toward me. I couldn't resist taking another look, and saw that the guy in my car wasn't wearing pants.  One officer starting ushering me inside as the other opened the rear door. I heard him say "We found him," before I blacked out.   From bitches who already have stitches! (It's an initiation thing.)  	115

 Yeah great film and awesome visuals but all space films are fabricated anyway, it's impossible to build in space so we can only imagine space environments in our world   Well going on the new Star Wars film coming out soon, it's really refreshing seeing them go back to its roots  I wish it would become the way forward for all studios now to see the benefits of real sets and practical effects  I think bad practical effects can stick out like a white elephant but at least practical models and effects will always age well whereas bad CGI never ages well and looks bland after a few years  In decades time you will always believe another world in older films because it is all real, nothing was faked whereas older CGI oriented films will look ropey as hell and because it was largely faked and made up, nothing is real to believe  I would say look at Jaws as a prime example, they had 3 model sharks that hardly ever worked but the film was a masterpiece, instead of having the shark as the focus, it had great characters and put suspense and that music to full effect meaning what you didn't see was far more unnerving  CGI in 3D looks ridiculous no matter how much money they throw at it, it will always look fake, then there is IMAX, I wish this format was the standard in films nowadays, all films should fill the frame and be as real and clear as possible, Nolan's Batman films are a shining example of it being used correctly      * I just felt like running   * Shit happens, sometimes   * Stupid is as stupid does sir   I wish aliens would visit earth to annihilate us in to oblivion, there I said it   Yeah maybe his parents or descendants had great power so he learned a few tricks of the trade to get by, he's also new like Fish so we don't know anything about him   I was being a bit sarcastic with the Star Wars reference   Well in recent images lately he looks like he's been hibernating for the past few years  Looks a bit rough and ready, maybe he went in to deep hiding from the authorities  So will we see him suited and booted soon, Scully looks like a million pounds, oh yeah   Yeah I would love Adam West to be head of the board of Court of Owls but that'd be taking it a little too far   Yeah he was, they got to put it in   I wonder if the I MADE THIS credits clip will return for the new episodes?   Maybe The Electrocutioner had him for a couple of weeks    Would be great to have a song or two by Seal  Kiss From A Rose is still one of my favourites    Honestly with Star Wars coming out soon and fever so high  Mark Hamill would send ratings into a galaxy far, far away...   Think it'd be great to have a few cameos occasionally featuring people from the Batman world  This can be actors, film makers, authors, artists or anyone connected with the Batman universe   Imagine cameos from West, Clooney, Kilmer, Keaton, Bale, Conroy, Freeman, Basinger, Kidman or DeVito, Carrey, Pfeiffer, Jones, Thurman, Barrymore, Eckhart, Nicholson, Hardy, Hathaway and not forgetting Hamill   Same here, maybe his hookers did sadistic sex torture or something   Our world is fucked anyway   There should be an episode discussions section down the right hand side for each season  Think this would be a great addition and give more coverage to lesser known episodes  It should be headed by season  episode style and would tidy the main section up a bit   Oh great, it takes a wheelchair bound human to raise this issue  WTF have the governments been doing all these decades?   I am guessing he had a murky past and Fish saved his life by giving him a job  Maybe he was a homeless thug or something and she hired him or something  Then am sure he would owe his life to her after she saved his, maybe that's it  	20

 I find I'm turning it on and off all the time. If I'm defending I have it on so I always see the ball but if I'm offense I'll turn it off and basically tap it on and off when needed.

I try to read and also see what's going on. If it's too fast I'd end up just doing the reading portion and then I might as well say screw it and read the manga   I should listen to some podcasts at that speed. The Giant Bomb podcast is so damn long   Man there's always direct TV or dish at trade and home shows and they are always like "how much do you pay for TV?" when you're trying to walk by.

I was sure someone would have demonstrated this on YouTube so I checked it out. Apparently it's actually 9% and it's not even noticeable without being compared side by side.

I wonder if we're getting to the point where we won't be seeing significant meaningful improvements in phones year after year. The only thing I can really see that has a lot of room to improve is battery life.. But as far as screen resolution and processor speed, and storage space, not so much.   I feel like the only reason the M9 is getting panned is because of the M7 and M8. A lot of people felt that the M8 wasn't much of an upgrade from the M7,even though the M8 is a fantastic phone. I'm seeing the same thing going from M8 to M9. The M9 is a great phone but that's two generations in a row where people felt that the next iteration wasn't a significant upgrade from the last   Who else here discovered this guy from Ashens?

But the fucking stupid thing is that it has to be your parent Google account. So the YouTube account I've been using for years and kept my username on because fuck using my full name on YouTube, I can't use background and offline listening   One time I went to California and a gas station I went to didn't have the regular pay at the pump machines, it had a single machine you went to, but you couldn't use a credit card at it. It had to be a debit card because it was basically an ATM for gas. So I had to eat both the machines ATM fee and my banks. Then I'm done with that and go inside to get some snacks, nope same fucking thing. Had to eat the ATM fee again. Fuck that place   I feel like I've read this before.   Also as someone who works sales, I recommend you tell customers of the place to ask the place to put their menu online. Stores are always apprehensive about new things and since you're presenting them with this idea or tool, even if it's completely free, they feel you have something to gain from it that they're missing out on.  If enough customers or sometimes even just one regular customer requests it, that puts the power in their hands to do it because the customers are wanting it. I've had stores order things I didn't have any intention of selling to them because it wasn't something that did well but a customer wanted it so they ordered it   Or Google maps   Below the parent post to mine you'll find redditors complaining about how unprofessional his shirt is, which to me sounds like a backtrack on the misogyny argument.

The ESA should be represented by their scientific accomplishments and research, not individuals scientists' choice of clothing.

It's been around so long you don't even have to see the logo to know it's a coke bottle   Yeah, I feel like the product placement on this movie actually felt like part of the Canon because of the way the park was being ran   I use supernews with a blocknews account for backup and have great success with that    This gets asked at least once a week on this subreddit it seems. There's nothing out there that's suitable. Once upon a time, EA released something like Sim City 3000 for Android but have since taken it down I believe. It was decent if your phone ran it.

I may have to try this out since I'm running my box on Windows    No custom skins is a deal breaker for me   It isn't always so bad. One time I went to buy a new wallet and couldn't decide between two that I liked. I decided to get both and decide at home because I didn't have all day to stand there. I'd just take the one I liked less back. Well each wallet was like 20-25 base price and we're something like 20% off. So I was expecting to pay $30-40 for the two. Well little did I know, there was an additional sale where if you bought items whose base price was 40-50 in one transaction, you got an additional percentage off your final total. Long story short, I kept both wallets because buying both ended up being cheaper than buying a single one on sale. I don't recall seeing any decent wallets for less than $10 when I was there during the no sale period    Yeah I literally saw nothing until I saw a comment mentioning how this post was the only thing in /r/all that wasn't about fph being banned. I had no idea what fph was so I went to /r/all and made the swift decision to never go there again because it is a silly place    Fucking this. I was on both ends of this though. I hated listening to others struggle through reading out loud because I could silently read faster, but I also struggled to read out loud.

The top edge of the USB port lines up with the top part of the headphone jack    I *hate* the diagnosis after a 5 minute conversation type deal. My wife has been through a lot the last couple of years and only in the last year was she able to find the right therapist for her and the end of last December she found a fantastic psychiatrist through her therapist.   Her previous doctors were giving her bogus diagnoses after 5 minute discussions without really working with her, one had said it "sounds like you may have bipolar but I don't want to make that diagnosis because it's difficult to treat". Sounded more like she didn't want to spend the time actually doing anything other than collecting a paycheck.   But when she scheduled an appointment with this psychiatrist she had to do a 70 minute questionnaire with him and they ended up talking for about 3 hours before he diagnosed her with bipolar (I believe II). But they started working with medication and he had her on a mood stabilizer but she was still rapid cycling after a week so he had her on an anti-psychotic for a month and ever since she's been really stable with the mood stabilizer    The velcro ones were the best. We had to stop using swaddled at 4 months because he started rolling and also really hated being swaddled    This is exactly why I nicknamed my son Little Ricky Bobby    The sad part is that is only $5500 per person which is not even enough to live half a year   http://philly.barstoolsports.com/files/2012/11/nigga-what-cosby.jpg   /r/Hitler    I would imagine smithing would make someone that much more interesting    It rustled my jimmies for sure    I've had this issue on two M8s.

Even with a brand new M8, I notice some connectors don't make as solid of connection with the Jack in the M8 as others. I have a cable from Monoprice in my wife's vehicle that it never really feels like it makes that final click when pushed in all the way, and it comes out too easily.

 If they have a bigger budget then they should find ways to balance with revenue. I can understand short term spending like during 2008 but long term deficits are very unhealthy.   Huge transfers from other provinces too.   At any rate, 30% debt to gdp is nowhere near a disaster scenario. California's debt sounds scary to other states, but they also don't have economies larger than many countries.   You're giving Ontario way too much credit. Even with the health care cost burden, a province taking up that much debt with comparatively small amounts of revenue is literally insane. The problem is that Canada is famously short sighted about spending to stimulate industries that will be important 20 years later (with the exception of oil sands). Now it's too late.   It's a ludicrous comparison because California has much less independent as a state than Ontario is as a province but yet is still able to fix their budget.  I'm a Canadian, and it's depressing for me to see provinces with absolute amateur hour financial policies and no industrial foresight.      Transactional taxes will always be regressive against people on the bottom of the ladder. Investments are one of the most efficient ways of wealth building (and retirement saving!!) so we shouldn't increase those barriers. Why not just have progressive tiers for capital gains taxes by earnings or total capital assets?   That's still regressive against small-time investors. Think of it as a sales tax but for investments.   Higher CG taxes could also spur smarter investment too, especially if the barrier to cash out is high.   Open the link incognito.   You don't need GPS. Phones have an IMEI identifier that you can track across cell sites and countries.   I discovered dry idea roll on. The one with shirt guard saved me from decades of stains.   To be fair, a lot of women are socialized ro be either immediately defensive (fear of assault) or reticent (fear of appearing easy). Especially when adrenaline or excitement is high with a crush or with a date, it could have the wrong effect.   I agree, but I'm specifically referring to the effects on inflation.   QE and the tarp programs could have been at least twice their size. The inflation needle barely moved, which means that they could have printed more money.   I wouldn't say no matter how efficiently. But the bar is indeed pretty low. You have to throw a bunch of money at a wide variety of industries in hopes that a few will pick up steam.   Industries need regulation, but cab drivers already suffer from obscene daily/weekly upfront medallion rental prices. Uber takes that out of the equation, grows substantially, and the city suddenly wants to "protect the labor market"?  The fact is that many Uber drivers are not full time and can do it as a flexible side job solely because they don't need to pay upfront for medallion usage. They pick their own hours, use their own cars, and can leave the Uber system whenever they want. These are all win-wins to me, and it's hard to see how Uber could extensively fuck over their drivers especially when the barriers to entry and exit are so low. Anyone can drive a car.   Those are lattes though, which require more labor. Come to the Bay Area and you can also find places that charge 5 for a "small batch" cup of drip. I mean, it's tasty, but not 3x more delicious.   Once wireless broadband gets good enough, prices will drop pretty quickly since wireless telecoms don't have to dump money into laying fiber to get performance increases.   Isn't that way too hot for olive oil?   It's the same for most tagging systems, which is why humans shouldn't be put in charge of organizing huge sets of arbitrary data.   Instagram is a lot more attractive than Twitter because the only thing you can do is post images. Substantially less bullshit and easier to monetize.   That's misleading. A substantial portion of housing price increases are due to the stupid amounts of VC money flying around. The Peninsula and SF are still the mecca of white new money.   On the other hand, paying several million in cash for a home is pretty much the literal definition of putting money into the local economy. The question is what the seller is doing with all that cash, and whether the new owner would sell to another foreigner or to someone local. Either way, it's a one-time cash injection from an outside source.  The real effect is the impact on housing prices. But part of the blame is on Vancouver itself, which for decades did not put any effort into developing any sort of robust advanced technology industry or financial sector. Coupled with the city being ridiculously beautiful, and all you attract are outsiders who want to buy land rather than be interested in building up local wealth.   But that is probably actually true to a very large extent. Given the age of the Universe and the short time that intelligent human life has existed (and will probably last), advanced civilizations are most likely blips in the Universe's timeline. On an intergalactic scale, you would have civilizations at any given time that are equal in technology, but at the same time they are very far apart. You could probably draw a very, very large boundary in the Universe in which humans are the most advanced beings at this given time. I'd wager that it could even be a substantial part of the Milky Way.   I'm not sure that's correct. There's plenty of oil wells around in protected lands. It might not be enough for the entire planet, but it would definitely be enough for a substantially smaller global population.   That's actually really hard to do if you don't have any kind of technical or scientific background. When you're not an expert, how are you supposed to know what kind of data or conclusions are sound? 99% of what you read is secondary literature anyway -- people aren't going to hunt around for a primary source, let alone know what a citation even means.   You can read a very eloquent and technical sounding blog post about how X cause all kinds of immune problems, and all they would have to do is include in a few real citations in order to make up bullshit in the other half of the article.   You're absolutely right -- people have selective memories. Your turn signal does not automatically trigger the asshole response in every driver around you. In fact, most people will just think "oh, he's coming into my lane" and slow down a little without even giving it a second thought.   What about super skinny jeans, a flannel shirt, and ironic mustache? I could even ride a fixed-gear bicycle to the party.   I think once the surgical wound closes, there should be no difference between this and a plaster cast.   What kind of drug was this? Doesn't sound like a normal effect.   No, the problem with AoU was that there was no tension and long scenes that did literally nothing to advance the plot. Joss Whedon was trying to cram too many things in there as if it was a TV show with multiple episodes. None of the main characters in the franchise were going to die and Ultron was always going to be defeated. Normally movies make up for that by having really compelling characters but Joss Whedon turned it into a fast talking and quick takes movie.   Totally off topic, but I wonder if black guys in general suffer from penis anxiety. Like they are worried that everyone they sleep with are expecting them to have a big dick.   I don't think universal healthcare would work in the USA. There's not enough accountability in public systems for it to work. You can already see it in Medicare/Medicaid and the VA system. I've witnessed all sorts of bureaucratic nightmares after living here for about a decade and it made me very cynical. For some reason in Canada, public systems just work better.   I'm Canadian, so I have some outside perspective on this matter. Having individualized healthcare in the USA (decoupled from employment) would never work because of how the insurance industry is set up. All individual plans on the exchanges are expensive and terrible compared to employment based insurance. Sure, you get subsidies if you are unemployed, but if you restrict the discussion to those who do have jobs then individual versus employment insurance plans are not even in the same galaxy.  The only way individual insurance would work is if Congress set new guidelines for insurance premiums and minimum coverage. That said, it should be a company's responsibility to provide comprehensive health care coverage to all workers, regardless of whether they are part time or on contract.   Not just that, but businesses that hire only part time work are able to fuck over people's live so much that they are unable to find other work. When you are on an unpredictable shift schedule and when you are basically "on-call" in retail, you have no control over your life.   You obviously have no idea how VC or Silicon Valley works.   The problem with reddit is that the community makes the site. Reddit literally has no other tech infrastructure that makes it competitive like Facebook or Twitter. They are ripe for disruption by better tech, better community organization, or better monetization strategies. It's only a matter of time.   Dude looked super hungover.   The fact that reddit is so huge but is unable to attract big talent speaks volumes about the management team, the board, and the work environment.   I don't get why people don't like True Detective this season. Were they really expecting the exact same thing as last year? I think this season so far has been an excellent and compelling crime drama with a lot of political intrigue.   If you can speak Cantonese, you can easily tell it's satire. Nobody can speak in that kind of flowery language about a fucking 16sqft apartment with a straight face.   Also, it's not clear why you need 7800 people to made a couple of phones that are basically minor modifications of each other.   It's probably something more subtle. It has to make sense in his head somehow otherwise most people would go insane. I'm sure that it's a mixture of extremely aggressive treatment for preliminary biomarkers, along with a big dose of self-rationalization.   To narrow it down a little: this is an extremely culture-specific manifestation of depression. I think mental illness is very rarely acknowledged in East Asia.   The fact that The Guardian referenced this guy is a statement of how far their journalistic standards have fallen.   I mean, reddit is basically a glorified BBforum that's sorted by rank instead of just by last reply. Communities around the internet existed just fine a decade ago. They'll just go somewhere else.   Imagine what iama would turn into in 6 months if all of a sudden the sessions turned into shit. Nobody would ever visit that sub again and PR would certainly never agree to appearances. It's like how bad or hostile interviews are the kiss of death for talk shows.  Similarly, imagine what would happen to reddit if all the submitted links turned into shit. The only thing left would be the same weekly questions on askreddit.   It's still anti-vaccine -- he still wants to claim the moral ground of being a skeptic, so he and many others pick on an arbitrary ingredient that "sounds scary". Because of course scary sounding chemicals are automatically dangerous.   HK-born here. I thought Infernal Affairs was a really mediocre movie while The Departed was great -- probably because a lot of the cheesiness and melodrama was thankfully lost in translation/subtitling.   If I were the SO, I would use this as an excuse to splurge on a high end super flusher with bidet and heated/cooling seat attachments.   The more fascinating part is that hair and teeth are by no means uncommon in teratomas, which means the genetic program required to differentiate into them must not be that stringent since cancers have messed up genomes anyway.   I think that influenza-aasociated narcolepsy is the bigger story than the connection to vaccines. It wouldn't be too hard to find the exact causative trigger if it's really the case and I'm sure that's what they are working on now.  Now that a potential molecule has been found to possibly trigger narcolepsy, they can also work on a drug to treat narcolepsy without using the other crazy ones on the market. It could also be used at the same time as a flu vaccination.   33:56, Eminem was about to burst out laughing. A few minutes earlier there were a bunch of fast cuts, probably because they were both cracking up. They're both definitely in on the joke.   There was a clip where she was on Ellen and they were talking about Ben Affleck's dick in Gone Girl. She just seemed really cold, sarcastic, and kinda snippy.   If you look at what AMD has been doing in the past year since the new CEO came in, it looks like they are working hard to pivot themselves back into the CPU game. Especially with the new architectures down the line, they aren't playing the budget game anymore.  While the integrated graphics are still a nice plus point on AMD's products, it's clear that Intel's solution is "good enough" and having good graphics performance integrated next to the CPU is not something people will throw money at.  My guess is that AMD wants to take a risk in order to boost R D for their CPU business. The need cash for that, and there's precedent for it when they sold off their fabs for a pile of cash.   I don't think MS is stupid enough to buy out AMD's CPU division. That would make Intel and the DoJ really angry.  It would be likely that they will buy out the graphics component that belonged to ATI, as well as all of their IP in the mobile sector. They would leave AMD with their x86, which will give the company a huge cash injection to push their new architectures.   I would throw money at the screen to see Defiant class ships go toe to toe with the Klingons!!!!   I think by the start of WWII it was a forgone conclusion that the KMT would lose. The Japanese invasion just stretched things out.   The problem is that the timelines are all messed up.  The Chinese Civil War happened at least a decade before the start of WWII. If the Communists never took hold, the Japanese would have been fighting the KMT. It's unclear if a Republican China would have stood a chance against Japan, so we could be looking at a very extensive Asian theatre in WWII.  That being said, if Japan still lost in more or less the same way as today, then I don't think the Cold War would really happen at all. You would never have the Korean War, no SE Asian incursions of communists, and I doubt Latin America would play along if the USSR's only "bright spot" of was in Eastern Europe (which they mostly won by invasion).   If there were indeed toxins in your body, why would they be hiding in your gut for you to shit out? They would be in your bloodstream where your liver and kidneys would take care of it. In fact, if you assume that some kinds of "bad stuff" immediately leaves the kidneys into urine, simply drinking lots of water would help you get rid of it.   Many Asians and Eastern Europeans would vote Republican if it were solely based on policy issues. Many are anti-gay and are socially conservative. The problem is that there are a few very racist voices inside the Republican party who aren't censured for what they say or believe. Very few immigrants would vote for a party that has that kind of behavior. It doesn't take much for a party to have the reputation of being racist.   Whenever someone says this I immediately think of the Ferengi, especially from Deep Space 9.   Avengers AoU was also incredibly boring with a million fast cuts. The first half of the movie was dizzying with all the scene changes. There was also about 50 minutes' worth of superfluous scenes that just made the movie plod along.   Kurt Russell was stressing me out the entire movie. I had no idea whether he would turn out bad.   Tuition freeze is a terrible idea. Look at what happened to UBC and SFU 15 years ago.   How is it possible that people are willing to pay that kind of money for alternative treatments but not want to pony up for expenses at a "conventional" facility?   He's also been saying this since 2008.  http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2008/jan/18/mccain-romney-hit-over-confederate-flag/?page=all http://www.businessinsider.com/mitt-romney-south-carolina-needs-to-take-down-the-confederate-flag-2015-6   "One guy"? Not too long ago, whites in this country routinely lynched blacks in public. The only reason why it doesn't happen now is that it's socially unacceptable to support it publicly. There are still plenty of racists around that would be more than happy to revive the old days and shoot a few black people if they weren't afraid of being arrested on hate crime charges.   It's bad if you find it late. If you get regular screenings when you are an elderly person then there is much less risk. The problem is that old people are notoriously crotchety and refuse to go to the doctor.   Anything cheap and white will be very sweet.   Are you then implying that math classes are less competitive in Eastern Europe and Asia? Because that's definitely not the case.   It's simple -- Ellaria doesn't give a fuck about anyone except for her love for Oberyn. She doesn't care of Trystane gets held prisoner in King's Landing, because that would help accelerate war with the Lannisters. She also doesn't care of Doran executes her afterwards, because she would get her revenge in war between the two houses.   Gendry is the only one left with definitive Baratheon blood.   Are you kidding me, most farmers that do staple crops such as corn and soy don't store seed. They buy their seeds every year because seed quality is extremely variable when you plant your own. Even if farmers weren't buying Monsanto they would still buy seeds every single season. The ones that are not are traditionally called "heirloom", which are the fancy kinds you find at your local farmer's markets.   You.... you mean we can get rid of all of the people from Digg?   The interesting part about reddit is that over time as this issue dies down, all the FPHers would overall be downvoted into oblivion by community members. The only reason why it's being upvoted now to the front page is because of its controversial value.   Not to mention who would you hire to actually do this? If a whistleblower decided to say something when they see someone sprinkling mystery powder over some meat that magically fuses pieces together, then that is the literal end of the restaurant. There'd also be lawsuits.   On the opposite spectrum, I know a few people who are ridiculously good looking and model etc. Many of them are just so goddamn positive about everything in life, and genuinely believe that everything will work out for everyone. Not a hint of cynicism or realism in their bones, which can be quite frustrating.   Dutch?   Been living with my girlfriend since 2012. Just the past week she told me that she thought my stomach was always bad and that I have chronic diarrhea or something. Nope, just reading reddit.      There is a huge "individual" component to it which is likely to be genetic. Birth control, for many people, works extremely well when you use it properly. But there are a small subset of people who will have recurring difficulties with hormonal birth control and these are the ones that show up prevalently on the effectiveness stats given "perfect use".   I just feel bad for all of the children in the family. In some ways I feel sympathy for the parents too because I wouldn't wish for any parent to have to make some hard choices when they see their kid fuck up. So many people are screaming that they should have taken their kid to the police on the first incident but I know of many more who would hesitate. For the most part, family bonds are extremely special, and it is disheartening to see the Duggar parents fail to prevent other incidents from happening. Then you have their proselytizing and public life, which makes it even worse.  The worst part is that the media focused so much on Josh and the parents with little disregard to the victims. Did they really ask to be thrown back into the shit again? We seemingly give lots of sympathy and support to other rape and sexual assault victims, but for some reason not them. And then we impose our own moral standards on them and accuse them of being brainwashed, as if they are too dumb to have a mind of their own just because they are conservative.   Grew up in Edmonton. It gets pretty hot up there, but I don't think I can ever get used to 30C+, or basically anything above 85F.   Actually historically party members did not regularly vote along party lines. It became such a huge problem that the position of Party Whip was invented.   Why? Germany, South Korea, South Africa, etc were all recent hosts. I'm sure that they could manage given some preparation.   Proportional Representation achieves the opposite goal of electing populist leaders.  A democracy is fundamentally designed to slow things down so that extremists and rash policies cannot quickly take hold of the government. The American system, while not perfect, is pretty good at that with two party gridlock. Other countries slow it down by having a multiparty parliamentary system.   How hard are landmines to see by infrared reflection? A cheap drone could do that kind of work, and at nighttime when the weather isn't so punishing.   When were we ever "promised" agency from Sansa?   Then maybe cities should be more responsible and not rely on bullshit tickets for padding their budgets.   Two turnovers in 30 seconds?!   On the other hand, Ned and Robb were foreshadowed to die for huge portions of the TV show and book before it actually happened. I mean FFS, they spelled out that entire scene when Stannis names Robb as one to die. If anything, after Jon gets stabbed he will be picked up by the WWs since this episode so clearly showed that they took an interest in him.   I don't live in SF directly so I can't give a 100% accurate comment, but in my experience getting around the city was a pain by car and by public transit. Parking is literally impossible and the transit system is a joke for a supposedly rich city. At least south of the bay you have some more breathing room. In my opinion there are just as many things to do for young professionals, with the sole exception of nightclubs.   I disagree -- the only thing that SF has that the rest of the entire Bay area doesn't are nightclubs. There are plenty of nice bars and restaurants all over, as well as fun things to do.  As for the commute, you could literally Uber to a Caltrain on both sides and still come up on top in terms of saving time and money. You could even own a fucking Nissan Leaf for the weekend jaunts and not be in the hole.   Renting is still not terrible south of SF. It's only if you want to buy a home. And at the rate those are going for, why would you want to do that? You could literally rent for the rest of your life and put the rest that would have gone into the home into mutual funds and come out on top in 20-30 years.   How do you break even with $1200/m and $45k? I was making that much and breaking even on a $2k apartment, so you should have been saving tons.   Then why not live south of SF if they're just into parks and things outside of their home? Places like San Mateo and Palo Alto are really clean and family friendly.   I've lived in the Bay Area for about 3 years and don't understand the hype of SF. It's close enough that you can just drive in to get to the nice stuff. 50%+ of the city is dirty as shit and the public infrastructure is awful. Why not live south of the bay? For the same price or lower you get to live in a little suburban area that is probably exactly the same as the nice parts of SF. Except for the nightclubs -- I don't think I've seen an actual one south of the Bay.   Not sure why you are being downvoted. The problem is that people are super picky about where they want to live. The peninsula south of SF still has quite a bit of affordable locations. Shit, even MV has apartment complexes with 1br at $2500/month which is peanuts in the area. I'm living close to Palo Alto and my rent/utilities comes out to be $22-2300/month. The combined income of me and my partner is $90k. We are able to put away a little bit of money every month, aren't living paycheck to paycheck, and we can't eat all the groceries we buy in a week either!  I think some people just have some really strange ideas of what a "middle class" and comfortable lifestyle is. Perhaps it's a problem of people moving to the area when they're too young, making more money than they can imagine, blowing it all on eating out and partying, and then complaining that they don't have a sustainable income.  A childless couple on $150k/year in the SF Bay could easily save up/invest for a downpayment for a house or even for retirement.   What would happen if the Y chromosome fused with the X during sperm development? Are these viable? In evolutionary biology there's many instances of chromosomes fusing and splitting between species, but how does this work for sex chromosomes?   I think it's painfully obvious that it's going to turn out exactly like how you described. Otherwise it would be such a stupid cliche that a beloved dragon princess suddenly rules the planet.   Sometimes it takes a little more than water. Milk of magnesia/magnesium supplements and mineral oil are pretty good laxatives, with the latter helping to lube things up as they come out.   It also really helps if you drink it at night and before you go to bed. Sucks for going to the bathroom, but it's way better for bowel movements.   Actually, negative results are some of the most exciting ones and can get high profile publications. The problem is that many graduate students will stop when they get a negative result instead of thinking about why it happens. When you can make a new story that revolves around it and break it down mechanistically, then you have a great paper. And imagine if in the process, you can tune the system from a negative result into a positive one! That is real science.   Nobody ever told me to wash the area under it, but it became natural to wash it while the rest of my body was getting clean. I might have lucked out though since I have very mild foreskin instead of a huge turtleneck.    I'm 31 years old and own tons of purple and pink shirts. I get nothing but complements. Wear what you feel like wearing!   If you need to exfoliate, don't use scrubs. Instead use anything with AHA or glycolic acid, which are chemical exfoliants that stimulate skin renewal. There are cleansers and moisturizers that contain them.   So you're blaming companies for wanting to make money from movies? Personally, I'd fucking love to see Defiant class ships drift in space and kill some Borg.  I'm a Trekkie, but even I know that making nerdtastic sci-fi movies isn't sustainable. You have to pay the actors and staff more and more to come back for each sequel. If you care about the "quality", you'd just read the novels and fan fiction. The old series are still there.   The Pauls are against oppression from the federal government. But states are totally cool to do whatever they please.   Not much of a backstory. She just basically believes everything that Littlefinger says and that everything will be alright if she just marries into the Bolton family.   I guess the best comparison would be if the same people complained about The Wire because it so very accurately portrays the brutality of life in the ghetto.   But that's the whole point of the episode. No matter how much she tries, she will never be stronger than the other assholes around her. It's the subversion of expectations and tropes that is classic in GoT.   But one of the points of the entire series is to show how women are brutalized by all kinds of evil men. Bringing about a visceral reaction is the goal, so why would they tone it down? It's supposed to be hard to watch.  It's not supposed to be mindless entertainment. Take The Wire for example. That show is supposed to make viewers uncomfortable. In hindsight how would the viewers have reacted if they toned it down?   Or they were actually counting on Sansa, one of the most pathetic characters on the show, to somehow pull a fast one on Ramsay? Really?   They also give lots of grants and fellowships to cancer researchers.  	116

 I will for sure. The translation is a pain in the ass so it's slow going but I'll get more posted as soon as I can.   A few weeks ago while cleaning out my Grandma's attic, I found a dusty old leather journal. I've just gotten around to reading it and it's some pretty dark stuff. I thought I'd post it here to see if any of you had grandparents with similar stories. Gran has dementia and has been moved to a home but I hope to be able to speak with her about what I've read.  I've typed out the first few pages (it was written in German and my translations may be a bit off, forgive me.)  _____________________________________________________________________________________  Day 1: I found this journal in the satchel of food and I suppose from here on I shall document what happens to us.     My name is Ella. My father, Fritz, knew this day would come. Our family, half Jewish, had been living in fear for some time. My fathers status as a well respected doctor kept us reasonably safe but he knew it was only a matter of time and he taught me all he could, working late nights in the office, learning field medicine by dim lamp light, practicing on fruit, meat from the butcher, and eventually the wounds of those who escaped the raids. Trucks were coming every day and taking neighboring families into the ghetto. They were getting closer and the fear in the air was palpable.     Every night when we finished our practice he would pack all of his supplies back into his medical kit and send it up to bed with me, insisting that when the time came I would need to take it and run. Mother, while generally a jovial woman, had been tight lipped and pale since my education started. I knew not what her worries were, only that every night when I made passage through the dark kitchen to my bed by the back door, she would hand me a satchel stocked fresh with the days leftovers, loaves of bread, cured meats and hard     Today, the time my parents feared came upon us. My uncle Karl, lean and blonde and fair as he was, appeared at our front step. I did not immediately understand the symbols on his uniform but my father behind me hissed SS. Grimly, uncle Karl had nodded. He motioned to me and instantly the satchel of food was slung over my shoulder and the heavy leather medical ag was being pressed into my limp hands. With sad faces my parents together told me to run and I did. Uncle Karl dragged my parents from our home and pushed them onto a waiting truck. My mother wept, my father stood proudly and checked his pocket watch before another SS officer ripped it from his hands. I could watch no further, and so I ran.     I made it to the end of the alley behind our home and nearly lost balance when a young man popped out at me from behind a tree. It took a moment for my fear to subside but when my vision cleared I saw that it was Eli, my betrothed, holding a satchel similar to mine and looking frantic. I started to ask him what he was doing there but a loud gunshot behind us made it obvious that this was not the place to talk. He grabbed my hand and we ran past the edge of town and into the small copse of trees separating us from the road to the next village. When we stopped to catch our breath I asked again. Eli, what has happened? How did you know I would be there? Your parents, are they gone? Please, tell me what is happening. Eli smiled sadly, nodding. Ella, our parents knew this would come. Your uncle, Karl, he gave them as much warning as he could. Your training, such as it was, and mine, were to prepare us to run from the Nazis and to save others as we went. My parents were taken two days ago. Ive been hiding in the alley because that was where my father told me I was to meet you.     Day 3: It is hot. My god, it is hot. The temples in each town we pass though are burning. The black smoke curls thick and makes the air unbreathable. Abandoned houses are standing, staring, with shutters and doors open, banging in the occasional stiflingly hot breeze. I told Eli I think they look like frightened faces. Two eyes, black and unseeing, and a mouth wide open in a silent scream. He shook his head, of course, and asked why I had to make everything eerie, but I saw him regard the houses more closely as we passed.     We havent slept since leaving our home town. No where seems safe. My fathers medical bag feels like a cinder block in my tired hands and the satchel, although becoming progressively lighter, is causing great aches in my back. Weve made camp tonight, safe or not, near the banks of a river. We think we are close to a town but all has been quiet.      Day 4: Last night we made camp and to bring our spirits up we pretended that we were having a picnic as we dined on rations from my satchel. We refilled all the flasks with river water and just as we were settling down, the sobbing started. It seemed as if it was floating to us on a breeze, though the night was still. Eli and I crept quietly from our camp, carrying our provisions along just in case, searching for the sound. We tracked the source of the sobbing to a large patch of tall grass and reeds near the rivers edge. Eli, being much braver than I, stood and parted the grass with his arm.    What I saw there, I may never forget. A young woman, a child perhaps, just beginning to bloom, was tied to an iron loop that had been hammered into the ground. Large gashes covered her arms and shoulders and her dark hair was matted with blood. I knew we couldnt leave her there bleeding so while Eli kept watch, I stitched her wounds with my fathers supplies and when I finished I untied her. She had no recollection of how she came to be here, only that she last remembered being dragged off the back of a truck bound for the ghetto, and then waking up here as the sun went down. I expected her to follow along with us when we prepared to leave but when Eli explained that we were travelling to save others, she waded across the river and started running without a backwards glance.    It wasnt long after that the first pink rays of morning crept into the sky and we stumbled from the trees into this empty little town. Weve barricaded ourselves in the cellar of a house here to sleep. At dusk, well be on the move again.    Chewing doesn't hurt, really, but yawning sure does. It feels like there's sharp things stuck in my jaw.   Not even close. My parents were being told this story in the 70's. Lol   I'm still waiting patiently for the next installment. Who knew mold was deadly AND addictive?!   It totally isn't sudden though. It's been a trend as long as I've been here.   Took the words right out of my mouth.   Everything on r/nosleep is real. There's a list of rules in the sidebar if you have further questions. :)   I understand the sentiment but I'm not sure r/nosleep is an appropriate place for this.   1. That link doesn't show a comment made by me. Get your shit straight before you try to use something against someone.  2. Why do YOU care so much? All I said was read the sidebar, and you dug through my comment history until you found something to launch a personal attack with.   3. I don't pretend to have power anywhere. I don't have any interest in being a mod. My interest is keeping r/nosleep safe from impotent goons like you who exist solely to start fights.    Readers are to act as though everything is true and treat it as such in the comments. No debunking, disbelief, or criticism (constructive or otherwise). Do not ask for proof. Be respectful to one another. Comments must contribute to the discussion.  So I basically did exactly what the rules state I should do, until you decided to start harassing me. I can only assume that your need to bully and belittle me stems from the fact that I'm a woman and thus an easy target for your fragile masculinity.   Sorry 'bout yer luck but only you can see your comments. Because they were reported and removed. You really need to stop with this whole personal attack thing.    I just need to make it SUPER clear that this response had nothing to do with you, and that I didn't make a "mistake." Your comments got deleted so I couldn't respond to them anymore. So you found another of my comments and decided to continue attacking me because... why?   This comment had nothing to do with you. I responded to KrackSmellin's post. YOUR posts got deleted and the conversation ended....   So you actually were so mad at me that you went to my profile to find something to use against me, and I'm the weirdo. I shouldn't have to defend myself but since you've tried to use something against me, r/all amuses the shit out of me and I end up in some really strange places. If you had the time to comb through which subs I've commented in, you also read my comments. Which were A. Calling someone an asshole, and B, being a woman and agreeing with a man. SOOOO weird. Totally worthy of a personal attack.    Then you don't belong here. Sorry.   If you know the rules, and you know that everything here is true, why even bother commenting in the first place?   Seriously?! READ THE FUCKING SIDEBAR.    READ THE SIDEBAR   We're actually downvoting you because you're breaking the rules. Read the sidebar before you act surprised about downvotes.   You're obviously new, or incapable of reading the sidebar.    If you're too stupid to follow the rules, you shouldn't be here. Reported. #byefelicia   Do a bit of research on the painter, see if you can find any photos or medical records, find out if she had a child that died. Also might want to look at county records and make sure you're of no relation to her.   Keep in touch, OP. We'll do what we can. What made you leave?   I'm a woman, and I actually agree with most of what you have to say.    Thanks!    I found smoking a bowl combined with some naproxen and the magic bag on my face, is sufficient.   Try having ABSOLUTELY no choice but to go to work with that pain. Because if you don't go to work you and your family will go hungry for the next week. So then you go and take care of a child while experiencing that. Like. The shit is bananas. I used to smoke pot and that helped a bit but I've been too broke lately.   I get that kind of pain in the back of my head on the left side. Fans or having the car window down reduce me to tears.   I wonder if that's whats up with my pulsing/crushing muscle spasm headaches. I have one wisdom tooth left on that side... Hmmm.   I heard everything and felt all the scraping and pressure, just no actual pain. Meanwhile hallucinating Simpsons "alternate universe" episode/Family Guy crossover.   My hair is dark but my Mum's was ginger 'til about the time she had me. Neither of us freeze worth shit and usually have to either deal with the pain or be knocked out. Dentist triple-froze me thinking she was being smart, started wisdom tooth extraction, then had to get new tools after I knocked hers out of her hands to tell her "THAT REALLY HURTS YOU KNOW."   So are you accusing the OP of being a liar? Or are you just a giant fucking asshole? I grew up in a junk yard. In my day you needed a mallet and a virgin sacrifice and an entire pack of smokes to get brakes done.   Yep. 18 hours writing wailing and puking in the emergency room. Scared the bejesus out of everyone around me and kept passing out but triage said I was cool to wait for EIGHTEEN fucking hours. Good old free Canadian health care. At some point someone gave me a pillow and a blanket because my sweater kept riding up over my chubby belly and some old guy was offended by my indecency. Needless to say, I don't have a gallbladder anymore. 200+ stones (worst my surgeon had seen in 25 years.) AND to top it all off, guess who didn't know they were allergic to morphine and reacts to it with crippling muscle spasms? Yep. That's right. Me.   Total toss-up between my first gallbladder attack, or the first trip to the bathroom after laproscopic surgery. I mean, I went drag racing the day I got out of the hospital AND I have heavily shaded tattoos. I'm pretty good with pain. But that shit was unbelievable. (pun totally intended.) Edited to add: I had over 200 gall stones in varying sizes. It was the worst my surgeon had ever seen in his 25 year career.    Me too... And getting these INSANE headaches. Shit. Nosleep wins again.   Que?   You should read the sidebar. Asshole.   You should read the sidebar.   Why are you even here? Nosleepers don't take kindly to fuckery.   Nosleep has rules. Sort of like.. your guide to experiencing nosleep in the best way possible and not incurring the wrath of writers/believers, etc. The rules are in the sidebar but I'm gonna paste them here for you anyway. They're easily missed.   Comment Rules: Readers are to act as though everything is true and treat it as such in the comments. No debunking, disbelief, or criticism (constructive or otherwise). Do not ask for proof. Be respectful to one another. Comments must contribute to the discussion. Report all comments that violate these rules.   I  don't think it's an immediate danger type of situation. More like she's mentally ill, unmedicated, and frighteningly unstable, and things could go wrong really fast. I personally have accompanied her to the emergency room when she has been out of control.    About the drugs/guns, yeah. I'm not sure what ended up happening there. I'm not sure about involving them in this though. It feels somehow like I'm being petty or something and the police wouldn't take me seriously.   Hey Reddit, it's advice time. Miss Manners never wrote abut this one.   Should you/how would you tell your neighbor that the person (from here on to be called P for ease of communication) caring for their children is someone who sells illegal drugs, and their body?    You in this instance have seen P in possession of multiple illicit substances, as well as an illegal firearm, and personally know that her past employment has been terminated due to stealing, inappropriate sexual conduct in the workplace, and failure to follow basic rules and instructions (essential when caring for children?)   I'm uncomfortable being a shit disturber. I was considering dropping a quick note in their mailbox. I don't fear retribution from the neighbors, but I do from P. She is already systematically trying to ruin my life because I refused to continue being her "bitch. I haven't let my dog out to pee alone, walked the dog alone, or left my door unlocked for any length of time in weeks. She is unstable and has been known to be violent. The SPCA was called on her due to suspected neglect and abuse of her dog, and since then she has been attempting to ruin my life by going behind my back to personal and professional contacts and spreading unfounded rumors in an attempt to ruin my reputation. I work as a nanny and I feel it's relevant to say that in my profession, a few unfounded rumors can easily destroy an otherwise spotless reputation.  So, Redditors, what do?   With the pain in your windpipe and the standing on the stool and the photo of the beam, I'd say someone was hanged in that pub and you yourself are in danger of the same. I'd have a look at the local records, maybe ask a few of the older folk if they know of any anecdotes about the place, and I'd likely find someone to stay with you or find somewhere else to stay until your parents return. Good luck OP and keep us updated. Edit: As well, in the jumbled up conversation with Sarah, "En mi camino" means "on my way." Not sure if that has any significance to you. Second edit: una luz en mi camino, means "a light on my path."   Congrats from Canada. You're all lovely and I'll personally owe you a drink if you ever find yourselves in Nova Scotia. First person to bring me one of those "yes" badges, gets cupcakes!   Not sufficient. You're an ass. "A gay" is seriously pissed off at you for being a bigoted prick.   Maybe you should find out more about the seller...   Hi   *ralph   ?   I 100% figured "old man" meant husband. Also didn't notice the name thing.   I hadn't thought of that. Like maybe he killed his brother to save him from becoming the next "perfect child" kinda thing? Or maybe he was just fucking evil and the pills and harnesses and such were to keep him from hurting anyone...  	53
    Except the particular change he linked to was also [opposed by Gavin](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6231#issuecomment-108892765).         I state you haven't learned anything new, because before waking up, according to the game, you know with 100% certainty that you WILL wake up, and you do.  That's not what you said above; you said the probability was either 100% or 200%. If in the analogous case where you wake up 1% of the time waking does tell you something new, and you're using the exact same model but in reverse in the 200% case, why don't you accept that waking tells you something new as well?  IE; if I played the game, I would know, well before going to bed, and long after, that the probability is, was, and forever shall be, 1/3, upon my waking.  How does that statement imply anything about whether waking is new information? You could make a similar statement about anything you update on that "after it happens, you know the probability in advance".     I agree with 1 and 2, but not 3, as I've explained.  That said, if you're using numbers greater than 1, you should probably come up with a word other than probability to describe it.    given that he's visited you  His visit itself doesn't reveal anything  I think you're confused about what those words mean. If we condition on X happening, and that causes us to change our probabilities, then observing X is teaching us something. How do you simultaneously say that we're updating on something, yet then turn around and say that it's not actually teaching us anything?  Now let's change the probabliities. If heads, the doctor will visit you 100% of the time. If tails, the doctor will visit you 200% of the time.  I said pretty much this somewhere else in this thread, although I'm a tiny bit uncomfortable with probabilities greater than 1, and would prefer some model that does the same but without those probabilities.   I'm not changing the question, though. The question is always "what was the coin on its first flip?"  In your example, the question changes from "what was the flip today" to "if tails yesterday, tails, otherwise what was the flip today".    Because Beauty cannot differentiate between what scenario she is in, she cannot use that to inform her decision on whether or not heads was rolled.  That doesn't follow. Just because she can't know for sure which scenario she's in doesn't mean she doesn't know anything at all about it. It's probabilistic knowledge, like I said.  I'm not sure what you mean. She knows a coin was flipped, and she knows that a heads flip means one awakening while a tails flip means a million awakenings. Except none of that matters because Sleeping Beauty cannot ever, in the course of the experiment, know she has been awakened any more times than one (because each time she is put back to sleep, she forgets having been wakened) and because she knows that she is awakened at least once in either scenario. In other words, Beauty acquires no new knowledge in either scenario.  The new knowledge is that she woke up *today*. That has a different prior probability depending on whether it was head or tails. If it was heads, then half of the days she won't wake up at all. If it was tails, then she wakes up every day. So P(awake|tails)=P(awake|heads)*2, and a Bayesian update on awake changes the probabilities. She doesn't need to know that she'd been awakened multiple times; the fact that she was awakened once is what she'd updating on. Yes, this would happen at least once either way, but the fact that it happens more than once in some cases is evidence for those cases.  That's probably not too convincing, so let me frame this differently.  Before she goes to sleep, there are 4 possibilities for the future, all equally likely. H/Mon, H/Tue, T/Mon, and T/Tue. True, she'll never see H/Tue, but it's still there. As soon as she awakens, she finds out that it isn't H/Tue, so now there are only 3 cases, all with equal probability.  Or like this:  If instead of being awoken 2 times on T, she's awoken less than 1 times, e.g. .5 times by flipping another coin after tails on Tuesday and waking on one outcome, then the Bayesian update is straightforward and it changes the probabilities. As the number of times increases towards one, the update becomes smaller and smaller, until at 1 it's nothing. I claim that when the number goes above 1, we should do the same update as when it's under 1.     Say the coin is flipped before she goes to sleep, but she doesn't see it. We ask her "what does the coin say"? This is exactly what's being asked later, so there definitely is temporal change in that probability from her perspective.    actual probability  Please define this. When I'm talking about probability, I mean subjective confidence. You seem to agree that from her perspective the answer is 2/3 (which is the entire claim here). I agree that from anyone else's perspective the answer is 1/2. Is there anything left we disagree on?    She will gain the knowledge that she wakes exactly once, for all intents and purposes, in either scenario.  I don't see why that matter. Yes, it's a single update (possibly done multiple times), but why does that make it invalid?  When she wakes, she knows she is in the experiment--but she also knows that she cannot know which scenario she is in.  I never said she can know; she has probabilistic knowledge, not definite knowledge.   When you say "answering correctly", you're strongly implying that it has nothing to do with probability.     Beauty gains no new information each time she wakes  She gains the information that she wakes. This has different probabilities depending on the coin flip, therefore it is evidence for the coin flip.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleeping_Beauty_problem#Halfer_position:  Nick Bostrom argues that Sleeping Beauty does have new evidence about her future from Sunday: "that she is now in it," but does not know whether it is Monday or Tuesday, so the halfer argument fails. In particular, she gains the information that it is not both Tuesday and Heads was flipped.    The two distinct probabilities will remain half and third, before and after waking  Then there must be something you're updating on in between. In this case, it's the fact that you woke up. If you don't know that you woke up (for example, you're someone else), then the probability stays at 1/2.   So we agree, then. The probability of heads occurring without any additional information is 1/2, the probability of heads after waking up is 2/3.  I wouldn't call P(T|B) "the probability of tails being the right answer". It's the probability of heads, given that you have awoken.    She still doesn't learn anything -- she knows Tuesday + heads wasn't a possibility to begin with.  Of course it's a possibility; if heads is flipped, and a day passes, it will be Tuesday+heads. The point is that the very fact that she woke up tells her that it isn't Tuesday+heads.    Based on the premise I think we're assuming "Beauty" has no fucking idea what day it is.  If the coin was heads, then she doesn't get woken on Tuesday, so she knows that it isn't Tuesday+Heads.    If you agree with that, then it should be trivial to work backwards to the thirder position.  We want to know P(T|B). We can decompose this into P(T|B, Monday) and P(T|B, Tuesday), and add them together after multiplying by P(Monday|B) and P(Tuesday|B) respectively, since they're mutually exclusive and exhaustive  P(T|B, Monday)=P(B, Monday|T)P(T)/P(B, Monday)   =P(B, Monday|T)(1/2)/P(B, Monday)   P(B, Monday) is equal to P(Monday|B)*P(B), which is 1/2.  So those cancel out above, leaving P(B, Monday|T) equal to P(T|B, Monday)  P(B, Monday|T) is easily seen to be 1/2, so P(T|B, Monday) is too.  P(T|B, Tuesday) is obviously 1.  So P(T|B)=P(Monday|B)P(T|B, Monday)+P(Tuesday|B)P(T|B, Tuesday)  =(2/3)(1/2)+(1/3)(1)=**2/3**. (The 1/3 for P(Tuesday|B) is 1 - the 2/3s for P(Monday|B), since they're exhaustive)   By the way, you can remove all of the |Bs from this to make it simpler, and just take it as background.    There is no new information. The "new information" is the set-up. The experimenter reveals to you that he visits twice as often when it's tails.  I think waking up *is* new information; you learn that it isn't Tuesday+H, as [Bostrom says](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleeping_Beauty_problem#Halfer_position).    I'm looking at one destroyed car. If the coin turned up heads, that car would have been destroyed. If the coin turned up tails that car would have been destroyed.  If there are 20 cars in total, then given any one car, the chance it would have been destroyed on heads is 1/20, while on tails, it's 1.   While I agree with this and am a thirder myself, halfers will disagree with "The likelihood the coin was heads given the fact that you were woken up is 33%" on the grounds that waking up isn't new information. I gave some responses to that elsewhere in this thread, but it's a reasonable position even if wrong.   What is your definition of the event B, not its value?  "I have awoken today".  P(Monday|B)=P(B|Monday)P(Monday)/P(B)  P(B|Monday)=1  P(Monday)=1/2(assuming the only possible days are Monday and Tuesday)  P(B)=3/4(I awaken 3 out of 4 possible days)  Multiplying those indeed results in P(Monday|B) being 2/3.    But I'm not seeing how this tracks back to the original problem. In the original problem, you wake her no matter what you flip. Being awake is therefore not itself evidence for any particular outcome. Thus, since she has no information she did not have when she went to sleep, her answer should not change--the probability of your flipping (or now having flipped) heads remains 1/2.  That's a fair argument. Let me quote from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleeping_Beauty_problem#Halfer_position  Nick Bostrom argues that Sleeping Beauty does have new evidence about her future from Sunday: "that she is now in it," but does not know whether it is Monday or Tuesday, so the halfer argument fails. In particular, she gains the information that it is not both Tuesday and Heads was flipped.    It does not matter how many times you ask the question -- the probability is always still 1/2.  This is trivially false. If I ask the question 0 times on tails, then the probability of the coin being heads, given that SB was asked the question, is ~1. If I ask the question .5 times (meaning I ask only half of the times that I get tails), then the probability of heads also clearly goes up, because being asked the question is Bayesian evidence for heads. So if I'm asked the question 2 times, shouldn't we be doing the same calculation?   2/3. Each state is equally likely, there are 3 states, thus each has probability of 1/3.    The numbers are so large that I would probably be incredibly old upon waking up making it more difficult to imagine and make my intuitions less accurate.  To fix that particular barrier to intuition, you can use the [incubator](http://lesswrong.com/lw/891/anthropic_decision_theory_i_sleeping_beauty_and/) version of Sleeping Beauty. In a nutshell, instead of being woken multiple times, you are cloned and put in separate rooms.    But yeah, I'm pretty much in agreement with what someone else here said - we're all arguing semantics.  It could be much of the argument here is semantics, but the actual SB argument isn't. There are several differing views that I don't think can be put down to semantics (see the various views on https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleeping_Beauty_problem for the kinds of arguments I'm refering to).  As phrased in the video, the answer to the question, "what's the probability the coin came up heads," is 1/2. If we're talking about the probability of SB guessing correctly, if she's asked each time she's woken up, the probability is 1/3 that she would be correct in guessing that heads was flipped.  There's a third question; what is her subjective probability that the coin was heads? The halfers and thirders disagree on that exact question, no semantics involved.  Maybe read through https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-indication_assumption and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-sampling_assumption, and you'll agree that it belongs in philosophy and isn't solely about semantics.  (someone said the odds are 1/2, 1/4, 1/4)  That's the default halfer position.     P(awake monday|T)=1 If they flip tails you will always be awakened on Monday no matter what.  There's some misunderstanding here. The probability of her being woken on a Monday is one, but the probability I'm referring to is "is today Monday?", which is less likely.     Also, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleeping_Beauty_problem#Halfer_position links to http://www.anthropic-principle.com/preprints/beauty/synthesis.pdf and says  Nick Bostrom argues that Sleeping Beauty does have new evidence about her future from Sunday: "that she is now in it," but does not know whether it is Monday or Tuesday, so the halfer argument fails  which may answer your question.   /u/Brian did a great job explaining what I meant by "Probability is subjective", so I'll just focus on the rest of your points. (Also see http://lesswrong.com/lw/oj/probability_is_in_the_mind/ and http://lesswrong.com/lw/s6/probability_is_subjectively_objective/, which might help clear up some confusion).  Like, if they got tails, they wake her up on monday, ask her which she thinks it is, then wake her up on tuesday and ask her what she thinks it is?  Yes, and they wipe her mind in between so she doesn't remember being asked.  Let me restate the problem, because you asked:  SB is put to sleep. A coin is flipped. If it is heads, SB is woken up on Monday, asked what she thinks the coin was, then put to sleep forever. If it is tails, SB is woken up on Monday, asked what she thinks the coin was, then put to sleep. We then give her some memory pill so that she is reset to the state she was in at the beginning of Monday. On Tuesday, we wake her up again, asked her what she thinks the coin was, then put her to sleep forever.   See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleeping_Beauty_problem for more.  There's the probability of h v t  If you want to know the probability from the subjective view of someone not in the experiment, then yes, it's 50/50. We're talking about her subjective probability expectation, which is allowed to be different.    She is not asked what is the probability of saying heads will be correct, she is asked the probability the coin landed heads.  And the answer is necessarily subjective, because it's a probability. See [this article](http://lesswrong.com/lw/oj/probability_is_in_the_mind/) and perhaps [this wiki page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_interpretations#Subjectivism) if you want to understand the subjective claim better.  If by probability you mean what that last page calls "physical probability" (which you seem to), then yes, nobody disputes that. We're talking about the subjective expectation of SB. Bayesian updating works on subjective expectations.  Bayes theorem is hard probability and math, so applying it to "subjective confidence" is not very useful.  You misunderstand at least one of these concepts. Could you explain what you *do* think Bayesian updating is, with some toy example? What is being updated, if not subjective confidence?  Your counter example does though have conditionals, the conditional that she has evidence of the toss. The SB problem is not set up as such. she has literally no new evidence, all she knows is she has awoken.  That's exactly what she learns, though; that she has awoken. That has different probabilities in the two different worlds. To be sure, the probability that she awakens *at least once* is equal; but the probability that she awakens is twice as much in a tails world than a heads one.  If you concede that her probability of waking is different in each world, i.e. P(awake|H)!=P(awake|T), then she can't think it's 50/50 anymore. If you're fine with an example where P(awake|H) is 1 and P(awake|T) is .01, then you already agree with that. So your complaint is that P(awake|T) is 1 and equal to P(awake|H). My claim is that P(awake|T)=2 if she awakens twice.  Getting back to my example above, if you are correct and P(awake|T)=1, then P(T|awake,Monday) (she is told that it's Monday) must be (by Bayes)  P(T|awake,Monday)=P(awake,Monday|T)P(T)/P(awake,Monday)  =P(awake,Monday|T)(.5)/P(awake,Monday)  Now, P(awake,Monday) should equal P(Monday), and that's 3/4 under your theory (1*.5 for H, and .5*.5 for T)  so  P(T|awake,Monday)=P(awake,Monday|T)(.5)/(3/4)  Now, P(awake,Monday|T) should be 1/2, so plugging that in  P(T|awake,Monday)=(1/2)(1/2)/(3/4)=**1/3**  This means that learning that it's Monday causes SB to think that the coin was tails only 33% of the time, and is a direct consequence of your view.  Now, if I modify the problem so that she *only* gets woken up on Monday, then presumably her probability of tails is now 50%. You need to explain why the *possibility* of her awakening on Tuesday affects her probability estimates, even though she knows that it didn't happen. What causality can there be there?  Your example simply institutes a test which is completely solvable, and therefore a tautology. P(X|X) is always 100% and isn't seemingly a very useful insight.  I'm trying to motivate a model where the likelihood of her awakening matters. If it matters for sub-1 probabilities, then it should matter for over-1 as well. Those might not be standard probabilities, but they do seem to work.    Me saying heads 100 percent of the time does not imply that the probability of a tails event occurring is absolute, just that it is the only thing I will observe.  We're not talking about some abstract property of the coin, called "probability". We're talking about what she will observe, if she goes and checks the coin.  If I only show you the coin when it lands on heads, then my telling you that I'm about to show you the coin is evidence which causes you to update your probability to ~1 of heads. Yes, the prior probability remains unchanged, priors never change (barring updates to prior selection policy, but let's ignore that). The posterior does change on new information.   Finally for Bayesian updating to be relevant at all, SB would need some information to condition her expected probability on. The problem is set up so that no matter when she is asked she will not have any info that changes her assumptions on the mean of the population being observed.  This *is* one of the harder parts to accept about SIA. You can model the new information as "she wakes up", which has probability 1 if heads and probability 2 if tails (because she wakes up twice). That *should* produce all the claims of SIA.  You haven't answered my reverse example, where she lives on tails only 1% of the time. In that case, clearly the fact that she lived is evidence for heads. If you gradually increase the rate at which she lives on tails, you gradually decrease the evidential import of her learning that she lives. I see no reason to stop at one; if she has 2 lives, their probabilities should add (if you deny this, I could cook up other scenarios that should force this kind of anthropic thinking on pain of paradox, like cloning her and then killing one copy with some probabilities).  I think there's also a terminological difference between us. You're referring to the "mean of the population" as the probability. The problem with that is that different people will calculate different means. When I say probability I mean subjective confidence. You need to take into account all information you have to get the probability.  (If your dichotomy matches mine, then we already agree, but I'm not sure if it does).   Intuition breaks down with such large numbers (see: Pascal's Mugging). Your brain can't represent 1000000 and rounds it down (see: scope insensitivity).  So while I share that particular intuition (and the related one in the Presumptuous Philosopher problem), I think it's a feature of those large numbers messing up our intuitions. (There's also the issue of uncertainty; if you're not completely sure of all aspects of the scenario, that can easily change the answer with these sized numbers, and while the problem is stated with surety, the brain "knows" that things are uncertain. To be explicit, your intuition refuses to assign a super-low probability to something that started out with a probability of 1/2, possibly in part because of uncertainty over whether any mistakes were made. If the probability of a mistake being made (or of SIA being wrong) is even 1/1000, that still makes for a far higher probability than your 1 in a trillion. So it's possible that you're doing a similar calculation subconsciously, and therefore rejecting something because of intuition despite the intuition not really applying.)     Even if she did know, Bayesian updating would only alter her strategy to answer correctly. The probability of answering correctly only has to do with the test parameters, which do not change the physics and resulting probabilities of a coin toss.    Nobody's saying it changes the physics. Anyway, I'm struggling to understand how you understand Bayesian updating. I understand it as directly updating probabilities, but you seem to think it doesn't? Surely one can obtain evidence for any particular outcome without impacting physics?  You also seem to be using probability in some sense of "a priori". Which definition of probability are you talking about?  edit: from another of my comments:   I lock SB in a room and put her to sleep. I flip a coin. If heads, I let her out. If tails, I pick a random number from 1-100 with a rng, and for all numbers except 100, I kill her in her sleep. If I picked 100, I wake her up. You are SB, you wake up.   What would be her subjective probability that I got heads?  What if I always kill her on tails? If you concede in that case, it's a pretty straight line back to the original case.     Well, the point of SIA is that you're more likely to exist in worlds with more of you. So if there are three possible copies of you, two in world a and one in world b, then you're more likely to be in a than in b. Your probability of being in b is 1/3, then.  It's important to remember that all these probabilities are subjective. Either the coin landed on heads or on tails (multiverses aside), the reason we assign probabilities to things that won't happen is because we *don't know* what will happen/has happened, i.e. uncertainty. So it's perfectly fine for different people to have different probabilities for something (for an extreme case, imagine I saw the coin land and you didn't, or the coin is biased but only one of us knows.)  Also, what I was getting at above is that you don't avoid the problems by halfing. If you learn the day is Monday, then your probabilities must change by Bayes theorem, but that seemingly should be equivalent to the case where she's only woken up on Monday, in which case it should obviously be 50/50.   So if I see the coin land on heads, I should still think there was a 50% chance that I imagined it, because math? Or, perhaps, evidence *can* change probabilities.  To give a more intuitive case: I lock SB in a room and put her to sleep. I flip a coin. If heads, I let her out. If tails, I pick a random number from 1-100 with a rng, and for all numbers except 100, I kill her in her sleep. If I picked 100, I wake her up. You are SB, you wake up. Does your "math" say that the probability of heads was equal to tails? This is pretty much the negative version of the problem.  Or as I've said elsewhere in this thread, consider her posteriors after learning that it's Monday. She can't still think heads and tails are equally likely, but you would naively claim she still should.   So you deny Bayesian updating as correct, then? Mind telling me what problems you've got with Bayes' Theorem?  A simple application of Bayes to learning the day says that the probability cannot be 50/50 both before and after.   They answer two different questions. If the exact question is "What is the probability that the coin came up heads?" the answer is 1/2 and if the question is "What is the probability that you would be correct if you guessed the coin came up heads?" the answer would be 1/3.  Probability is inherently subjective, the first question is meaningless unless it means the second question.  If you disagree, explain what this "probability" you speak of means without referencing any individuals' experiences.  (If you mean "is the coin fair" in the frequentist sense, then obviously the answer is still yes; I wouldn't call that probability until it was turned into expectations, and anyway that's not what is meant by probability here. I think you're actually conceding that the basic reasoning is correct but you're using different definitions or something.    The probability of the original event i.e. the toss, is still one half.   Why? What happens if SB finds out it's Monday and does a Bayesian update, according to you?     its a silly notion at best. The probability of the coin being heads or tails is always 1/2. Unless i seriously misunderstood this, then the probability of the coin being heads or tails is 1/3rd because there are 3 possible outcomes from the observers perspective. The silliness here is assuming that because there is an unknowing observer, then the probability changes from the perspective of the observer. Personally I think this is wrong, the probability of heads or tails is the same. I also think its wrong from the observers perspective. I think that there is still a 1/2 chance of it being heads or tails, but from the point the question is asked the probability of it being monday is 3/4's and the probability of it being Tuesday is 1/4. If i've missed anything i hope someone lets me know. Who knows, this kind of thing might lead somewhere one day, I wonder what the probability of that is.   So if she is told that it's Monday, what is her posterior on heads after a Bayesian update? How is that case different than when she's only woken on Monday regardless of coin flip?   Probability is subjective. You're right that from anyone else's perspective, that probability is 1/2, but for SB, it's 1/3.   (Also, consider her Bayesian update upon hearing that it's Monday. If she should previously think that heads/tails were equally likely, then she'd need to think differently then, but that seems inconsistent with the same naive intuition that's leading you to insist the probabilities must be equal.   /u/CMAuGaming already recognizes that the probability of the sleeper being woken/asked in a scenario where the coin landed heads is truly only 1/3. But the question of probabilty of the coin landing heads is still simply 1/2.  Probability is subjective. If you concede that the subjective probability is 1/3 (I.e conditioning on being awake and being asked a question), what do you mean by saying the probability is 1/2? Do you think there's some objective "fact" that something has a probability of happening even if it doesn't happen?   Except Dumbledore wasn't sure if Q had a time-turner. See the Azkaban arc.   Frankly, considering the history of US-Iran relations, the real question is why they should trust us  I don't think they should trust us. That said, the argument "they shouldn't trust us, therefore we should give in" is disingenuous.         Wow, it's true. This will make signing in on my phone a lot easier, thank you.   Hm, manually saving keeps the achievement.   That's still a bug though, reset should automatically save first.   Those are specifically to gmail, which is obviously going to be higher simply because we know one side supports encryption then.  Besides, if hostgator didn't use encryption, it doesn't matter how many others did, like I said above.   Got a source for that? It's not actually relevant in this case, because the article explicitly says that it wasn't encrypted  Not only did HostGator send keys in plain text via e-mail, it also appears to have sent them over an unencrypted channel.   It just only increases the wind at our backs to continue organizing around the **70%** of Americans who are with us on this issue, said Sasha Bruce, a national coordinator for NARAL Pro-Choice America, referring to the **63%** of the public that supports abortion rights, a rate that has remained steady for decades.  So, in other words, she lied.   First, very few emails now days are sent in plain text unencrypted.  Almost all users have started using TLS, which means the emails would be transmitted encrypted in transit.    You missed the point. It doesn't matter if the user accesses his email securely, because the emails themselves are sent over the internet unencrypted. Any server that processes the email (of which there are many "hops") can see it.  On the third point, if you have the key, then you have to be able to see the traffic between the site and the user in order to decrypt it.  That means you have to be tapped in very close to the server or very close to the end user.  Neither of those are easy, most require physical connections at the location.  True a proxy server would be a great way to go, but the user would still need to be using the proxy server.  It is simply too much work to steal an SSL key and then try to get that traffic.  Sure, if it were Amazon or Bank of America, then yea, go for it, having a key like that might be really useful.  Having a key for Bob's Putty Store who sells putty to 20 people a month isn't going to be as useful.  Bob's putty store doesn't need HTTPS if he doesn't need the security of HTTPS. This effectively reduces the security model of HTTPS to HTTP+email interception.  If you signed up for HTTPS, you should expect your keys to be safe.    Could you give examples?    Do you know of any research that finds a link between drones and recruitment, or is it all just speculation?    Drones symbolize a failed war that is based on false pretences and lies, which are creating more terrorists rather than eradicating terror.  http://patrickjohnston.info/materials/drones.pdf  We find that drone strikes are associated with decreases in the incidence and lethality of terrorist attacks, as well as decreases in selective targeting of tribal elders.  ...  A systematic analysis of the data reveals that drone strikes have succeeded in curbing deadly terrorist attacks within the targeted territory in Pakistan. Specifically, the key findings of our study show that drone strikes are associated with substantial short-term reductions in terrorist violence along four key dimensions. First, drone strikes are generally associated with a reduction in the rate of terrorist attacks. Second, drone strikes are also associated with a reduction in the number of people killed as a result of terrorist attacks, i.e., the lethality of attacks. Third, drone strikes are also linked to decreases in selective targeting of tribal elders, who are frequently seen by terrorist groups as conniving with the enemy and acting as an impediment to the pursuit of their agenda. Fourth, we find that this reduction in terrorism is not the result of militants leaving unsafe areas and conducting attacks elsewhere in the region. On the contrary, there is some evidence that drone strikes have a small violence-reducing effect in areas near those struck by drones.  If you've got actual data showing that it creates more terrorists, as opposed to some disgruntled former officials, let me know.   Have you seen http://patrickjohnston.info/materials/drones.pdf ?

What's the answer to this paragraph?:  The trouble is that the third criterion makes little sense. Jupiter is dogged by asteroids called Trojans, Earth has the moon following its every move and Neptune crosses orbits with Pluto.   Except obviously whether Pluto is or is not a planet is a non-factual question, and is entirely dependant on your definition of planet.    While it sounds all insecure, really, there are far easier ways of doing that attack that don't require hacking an email, then finding and setting up an MITM style attack or snooping on a connection.  First of all, you don't need to hack an email; these are sent in *plain text unencrypted*, so anyone on the network path it was  on can see them. Second, if it's so useless, why don't you publish all your SSL keys for all the websites under your control?  Third, what "easier" method is there for passive decrypting https connections or actively mitming an https connection than this?   The end user would need to be identified, then a MITM attack or network snooping setup on them.  Or set up a proxy server, then mitm all https connections through it that you've got the key for.            Guess someone only read the title ...

That's a moral claim, and research establishes facts.      However, if a 21 year old is getting nudes from a 14 year old, then yeah they should be thrown in lockup.   CP laws are not necessary for such scenarios; you could be prosecuted for abuse directly. CP laws would only be relevant where the person *didn't* abuse anyone. No-one under the age of consent can consent. No-one under 18 can make the decision to be in pornography that gets distributed to others.   Why can they consent to sex but not to porn?     What do you mean by illegal but no jail?  And how do you define "young"?   If you take the position that gore videos should be illegal to possess, fine, at least you're consistent.   So any CP recorded with consent of the kid would be fine? That's already a big step from currently.   That reaction is why he sourced his claim. His link is http://www.newsmill.se/artikel/2011/01/14/stoppa-myndigheters-vergrepp-p-barn, seems to be down but archived [here]( http://web.archive.org/web/20131118214840/http://www.newsmill.se/artikel/2011/01/14/stoppa-myndigheters-vergrepp-p-barn)  You can use Google translate.   So then you *do* support changing current CP laws to be more lenient.      cp is always recorded by a perpetrator.  Uh, nope. Kids have been arrested for taking pictures of themselves. See https://falkvinge.net/2012/09/11/child-porn-laws-arent-as-bad-as-you-think-theyre-much-much-worse/ (his first article https://falkvinge.net/2012/09/07/three-reasons-child-porn-must-be-re-legalized-in-the-coming-decade/ is also worth reading)   The point is that the above argument is just as valid against currently legal things like gore, thus making current laws inconsistent.   What age are you referring to?   So you'd consider kicking out a 30 year old who has no money child abuse just the same, then?   But gore videos are perfectly legal.   Not legally, no. Or do you think something *should* be illegal while at the same time parents shouldn't be concerned that their kids are doing it?   I'll definitely say that the term child abuse can't be applied for 18 and up. Your last sentence is a semantic game and doesn't reflect what the term is used for.  Whether sending out a 16 year old is abuse or not is a more complicated question, and might depend on a lot of factors (are there easily accessible places for them to move, how self-sufficient are they, etc).   If we're talking about 13 year olds, then making it acceptable for them to have sex means lowering the age of consent. They denied that's what they wanted, so presumably they're talking about someone older.     Child abuse includes being kicked out on the street because you don't share the same religious views as your parents which could be sex before marriage for example.  If you're old enough to be having premarital sex, surely you're old enough for it not to be called "child" abuse?         Nobody even thought these priests were abusing children untill the word got out so you can't truly know the actual rate of abuse the Catholics are only out because they were caught.   You haven't provided any evidence of that. Surely you see the fallacy involved in going from "we can't know" to "one is definitely higher than the other".  Have you got any reason to believe that priests' abuse is less likely to be reported than other people?  I couldn't find a study of how many children were kicked out of their parents house onto the street because they had different religious beliefs (or none at all), so this is very much a hidden rate of child abuse (and yes this happens frequently in more conservative states and countries).  That's a very different problem than what you originally said, and requires different solutions. I fail to see how allowing premarital sex would address that at all.      But you're not their expected attacker. They're trying to keep out generic bots.   If religious people don't have a higher rate of abuse, then religion can't be responsible for more abuse, right?   #    ##    They don't have a higher rate of abuse than average http://www.newsweek.com/priests-commit-no-more-abuse-other-males-70625  So there's not even a correlation there, let alone causation.  edit: also, might be misreading you but are you proposing lowering the age of consent as a way to reduce child abuse?   If you don't know in advance which kind of question it will be, then that works fine. Those sites are usually small, and are just trying to stop bots not specifically targeting them.   They saw the chair pulled out and didn't have enough time to notice that they didn't fall. You can't think fast unprepared.         They're reporting something from the Iranian government, so it's less likely that it's made up.      It's not based on assuming that everyone is rational all the time (which is unrealistic and wrong), but even if it was, that wouldn't create a duty for anyone to do anything in particular.   Uh, no, there's no duty to act in your own self interest, that's not how stuff works.   I thought it was against bigger blocks ...

Ultimately, the board asked me to demonstrate higher user growth in the next six months than I believe I can deliver while maintaining reddits core principles.  Hm, funny coincidence.    One of the things I'm interested in is good-enough heuristics for when we don't have the time or ability to evaluate arguments.   My heuristic is "if the idea isn't mainstream, and additionally I don't care enough to evaluate it, it's probably wrong, but keep an open mind about it seeing as you haven't looked at the arguments in depth".  And if the idea *is* mainstream, the reverse; accept that it's likely true, but keep an open mind about rethinking it should you suddenly start caring enough to do research.  The trick here is to get good definitions of mainstream. (Left as an exercise to the reader.)  There's also the point that even if you don't *know* that people believe something, they often will. You sort of get this intuitively once you've happened across enough worldview-challenging moments, and then you really *get* on some level that almost every viewpoint has some really strong arguments for it, and you should just be skeptical about things you can't research yourself.  I think that diminishes the usefulness of the heuristic, because you don't *have* first-person knowledge of what people believe.   I would argue that getting some sense of what people believe in, even if it's not exact, is actually pretty efficient relative to argument evaluation (for most argument-person pairs).  In some cases, but only when you're explicitly not interested in being able to defend your conclusion, and are willing to accept a lower level of confidence. Also, I think the vast majority of the weight of evidence will come from a binary isMainstream.  (As for mainstream definition, you could say "mainstream among experts", but that can get complicated sometimes. [This post](http://nostalgebraist.tumblr.com/post/119000645209/slatestarscratchpad-nostalgebraist-my) is kind of related.)    I mean, I think "people believing in it" isn't just "at least one person believing it"; if more people believe in something, that's informative.  This might be more useful if we used specific examples. My standard one when talking about these kind of stuff is UFOs and aliens (which was also mentioned in another comment here). So, fine, the fact that people believe in them is evidence that they exist; but this is extremely low evidence.  Now, take an example where fewer people believe something. I can't actually give any examples, because if I've heard of it, probably a number of other people have as well, and some people believe everything they hear that agrees with their worldview (yes, really, read through comments on conspiracy websites until you're convinced of this). But if we imagine something that isn't that convincing to such [people, and therefore has fewer believers, is that reason to assign the evidence lower weight? Maybe, but the numbers are so small here that it doesn't really matter.  Some other things to factor in: maybe we should calculate (number of people hearing X)/(number of people believing X), to adjust for more people believing things that more people have heard of; you should also adjust in the other direction for correlation between popularity as opposed to belief, and truth.   In the end, I think other methods of finding truth are far more efficient; finding out how many people believe something requires you to do a survey, and if it's already been done, then chances are there's enough info about the topic to make a judgement anyway.  You also need to make sure you don't double-count this evidence; if people's beliefs are based on arguments, then conditioning on those arguments partly screens off those beliefs, and it's probably really hard to properly adjust for that.   Yes, but very weakly. In general, if a question even comes up and you're thinking about it, *someone somewhere* believes each side.  In your example, if nobody had ever believed in god we would never even ask the question! So as a heuristic, this seems useless, because it doesn't distinguish between anything you'll actually deal with.  (Put differently, the selection of possible beliefs you happen on already adjusts your implicit priors, making the question moot.)    Based on the research conducted by the Tor Project in conjunction with tier researchers, around 1.5% of Tor traffic is to hidden services and of that 1.5%, and 2% of that 1.5% is thought to be connected to child porn. Of the child porn sites, 9 out of 10 sites are thought to be honey pots run by law enforcement. (This was in one of the Tor Project's Weekly News Blog segments.)  Could you link to that? (And these honeypots actually host files? Is that legal?)   Even though we have spent three plus years begging merchants to accept bitcoin as a payment network (with some major wins, Overstock, Dell, Microsoft, purse.io, Gyft).  And how many of these are accepting payments *only* on-chain?      I edited the post to include the source and full quote.

Saw a quote once that said that most arguments end in a disagreement over who has the burden of proof.   If you think you're right, you'll automatically think the burden of proof is on the other side. You need more subtle and robust ways of determining things.   (Also, for any non-completely-batshit-crazy view, there will be a decent amount of "proof", and as it takes 10 times as much effort to disprove bs than to say it, you'll quickly need far more efficient heuristics for sorting through claims. Logical fallacies are good for debates with people who make them, but if you have any real debates they have diminishing returns.)

As to your point of smart people having bad jobs: I still feel that if they wanted to, in most cases, they could get a good one. Many smart people don't think all too much about applying their intelligence to the task of getting a good job. Also, lots of smart people are in academia and making very little, for what I believe are altruistic reasons.   If their value to the company is significantly more than their pay, why can't they get a better job elsewhere? Or put differently, what causes a free market failure in jobs? Are switching costs too high? Are companies colluding to keep wages down? If not, why isn't there a bidding war for these underpaid workers?  (I'm asking seriously, not very familiar with the job market).   I think sometimes smart people forget how dumb the average person is. Yeah, if you're in the top 5% in terms of brains, it's probably not all that hard to get a good paying job, but 95% of people are not like that.

I've sold to them before without having any issues.   But were the cards previously sold by saveya?  Try cardpool! Offering $80 for a $100 Hollister card.  I only have a code, no physical card :(  Was expecting saveya to work fine.   I was looking over giftcardwiki prices when I saw that there was an apparent arbitrage opportunity on hollister cards; https://giftcardzen.com/buy/130/Hollister was selling online cards for 19% discount, while saveya and giftcards.com were offering 80%. So any credit card with greater than around 1% rewards meant profit, and since everything was online there's almost no risk of the price changing.  I ordered 3 $100 cards, then tried to sell them to saveya. A few minutes later I got this from saveya:  We experienced an issue during balance verification for the following gift cards that you have submitted.  and  This code was previously acquired from this seller  listed as the reason.  So apparently you can't sell cards to saveya that saveya already sold at one point in time. I couldn't find anyone saying this, a [search](https://www.google.com/search?q="This+code+was+previously+acquired+from+this+seller") for the message turned up 0 hits, and I can't call saveya today because it's Sunday. Tried on giftcards.com, got a "security error".  Anyone have this experience? Anyone had this and succeeded after calling? Are there other buyers that will reject cards they've seen before?    In investing, if you don't think something has intrinsic value and I do, I win.  I'm not sure what you mean by winning here, but why is the default to assume intrinsic value without proof?  Besides, if we accept your claim that all you need to show that something has intrinsic value is someone claiming it does, then bitcoin *does* have intrinsic value, contra your above claim. ([Here's an example of someone who thinks it does have such value](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/12846/you-say-bitcoin-has-no-intrinsic-value-twenty-two-reasons-to-think-again/)).  	154

September 6, 2016   So, I am a creature living in the sewers of the audiophile world. I am a father of two small children, so therefore my budget is fairly limited. Today my Onkyo TX-NR609 amplifier ceased to exist. It was nothing fancy, but it did the trick. I would game/movie watch/listen to tunes through it VIA xbox/xbox 360/xbox one/PS3 (media server). So all I would like to know, is what would be a decent replacement for the amplifier? This is assuming my speakers/sub are still operational. I'd like to stay around $500.00 CAD.   I had a dream the other night where I was back in a department store in my home town where my mom would take me shopping for back to school clothing. The place was so dimly lit and eerie. As I was walking through I felt like I wasn't me, and I somehow hijacked someone else's body as I roamed around. I ended up bumping into 9 year old me trying on baseball hats in the mirror and it freaked me out. I like to believe that I had time travelled in my sleep, and that frightens me.  EDIT: redundancies.   Just give me what I came for, then I'm out the door again.   Depends on the package.   Haha I'm in.   That would be super. Set up a date with Ian, he knows my schedule haha. Thanks a million.   Thanks for the input. This is my first time really messing around with audacity and/or recording anything at all really. But I think you're right, that as long as it's listenable we shouldn't worry about quality too much. Also, I'm not aiming for professional studio quality, I just want everyone's levels to be somewhat similar. When I listen to it driving I noticed the internet streamed voices were a bit of an ear assault.   I'm scared of the effects menus, they're scary and it makes me frightened.   Hey thanks!

As anyone could have guessed, we are running into a few production/quality issues.  I've managed to figure out how to record a stereo mix of the audio through google hangouts, however with that, everyone's sound quality suffers slightly.   If anyone with audio/recording experience could give suggestions, we would be greatly appreciative. My questions are as follows:   * How can one record their own voice in addition to a stereo mix of what's coming from the internet? (When I attempt to open two audacity windows and alter "stereo mix" to my microphone, it automatically switches to the same recording settings in the second window).   *  If all parties involved record their own voices, how does one match them up simultaneously/ seamlessly? Is some sort of queue required at the beginning like a [clapperboard](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clapperboard)? That to me seems to be the only way, but I have no idea what I'm talking about.   * If a stereo mix of audio is recorded from my station, where my voice will be crystal clear, and others may sound "tinny" or louder than mine, what is the best way to equalize the audio?

Almost 2 years, RIP.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Hastings_%28journalist%29  Death  "On June 18, 2013, Hastings died in a single-vehicle automobile crash in his Mercedes C250 Coup at approximately 4:25 a.m. in the Hancock Park neighborhood of Los Angeles.[53] A witness to the crash said the car seemed to be traveling at maximum speed and was creating sparks and flames before it fishtailed and crashed into a palm tree.[54][55] Video from a nearby security camera purportedly shows Hastings' vehicle speeding and bursting into flames after crashing.[56]  Witnesses described the car's engine being ejected 50 to 60 yards (4655 m) from the scene.[55][57] Hastings' body was burned beyond recognition. The coroner identified the body by matching fingerprints with those the FBI had on file.[58][59] Two days after the crash, the Los Angeles Police Department declared that there were no signs of foul play.[60] The coroner's report ruled the death to be an accident.[61] An autopsy showed that the cause of death was massive blunt force trauma consistent with a high-speed crash.[61]  Hastings was eulogized in the media by figures such as Christopher Hayes,[62] Rachel Maddow,[63] his co-workers at BuzzFeed,[64] and others.[65] Tree at the Hastings crash site in July, 2013. Coordinates: 34.082459N 118.338603W Allegations of foul play, and assertions to the contrary  Soon after his death, some described the circumstances surrounding the crash as suspicious.[66]  Former U.S. National Coordinator for Security, Infrastructure Protection, and Counter-terrorism Richard A. Clarke said that what is known about the crash is "consistent with a car cyber attack". He was quoted as saying "There is reason to believe that intelligence agencies for major powersincluding the United Statesknow how to remotely seize control of a car. So if there were a cyber attack on [Hastings'] carand I'm not saying there was, I think whoever did it would probably get away with it."[67] Earlier the previous day, Hastings indicated that he believed he was being investigated by the FBI. In an email to colleagues, which was copied to and released by Hastings' friend, Army Staff Sergeant Joe Biggs,[68] Hastings said that he was "onto a big story", that he needed to "go off the radar", and that the FBI might interview them.[69][70] WikiLeaks announced that Hastings had also contacted Jennifer Robinson, one of its lawyers, a few hours prior to the crash,[71] and the LA Weekly reported that he was preparing new reports on the CIA at the time of his death.[72] His widow Elise Jordan said his final story was a profile of CIA Director John O. Brennan.[73] The FBI released a statement denying that Hastings was being investigated.[60]  Motor Trend technical director Frank Markus said that the ensuing fire was consistent with a high-speed car crash.[74]  There are conflicting opinions as to Hastings' death. After his death, some media outlets recalled that Hastings claimed to have received death-threats from the military after the McChrystal article.[75] Hastings' widow Elise Jordan has said she believes his death to be "just a really tragic accident".[76][77] His older brother, Jonathan, said he believed Michael was experiencing a "manic episode" shortly before his death, and that he may have had suspicions were it not for this observation.[78]  Cenk Uygur, friend of Hastings' and host of The Young Turks, told KTLA that many of Michael's friends were concerned that he was "in a very agitated state", saying he was "incredibly tense" and worried that his material was being surveilled by the government. Friends believed that Michael's line of work led to a "paranoid state".[79] USA Today reported that in the days before his death, Hastings believed his car was being "tampered with" and that he was scared and wanted to leave town.[80] FBI files FBI file on Michael Hastings  The FBI file on Michael Hastings and its attachments (totaling 21 pages) were released to the public on September 24, 2013,[81][82][83] after investigative journalist Jason Leopold and MIT doctoral candidate Ryan Shapiro filed a joint suit in July 2013 against the FBI for ignoring their FOIA requests for the file.[84]  The FBI failed to respond to the requests within the allotted 20-day period.[85] On August 15, Leopold released a statement that read, "The Department of Justice (DOJ) has indicated that the FBI has likely located responsive records pertaining to investigative journalist Michael Hastings".[86] Al Jazeera, along with Shapiro, released results from a FOIA request showing that the FBI's Washington field office had opened a file on Hastings in June 2012 to store "unclassified media articles" and "memorialize controversial reporting by Rolling Stone magazine on June 7, 2012". The attorney who filed the FOIA lawsuit, Jeff Light, suggested that it was uncommon for the FBI to open such files on reporters."  **Edit: After reading the comments, I can see I'm not the only one.**            Clever girl   You are very welcome.

OP was in the bathroom while the cat, sitting on top of the toilet, "got into the shaving cream" as the title suggests, knocking it onto the floor and immediately divebombing on top of it as it explodes. Then, the cat decided to roll and thrash around in the same spot, ending up staring into a corner, and waited while OP got his/her phone out and took a picture.  That's probably what happened, right?  I can see why your cats look at you this way.   Nice try, google AI   And stood in the same corner while OP fetched the phone/camera?  That cat would be long gone.  And yes, I've had cats my entire life, from the moment I was born to age 30.   It's tough because there's not a lot of Bitcoin owners out there, in proportion to non-bitcoin owners. And many of those who do hold, are doing so long term, not readily spending. Also, because of the inconvenience and security risk associated with 3rd parties, many people will shy away from a Bitcoin transfer when there are other viable alternatives (cash, money order, check, credit, Paypal, etc.)  There needs to be some serious changes (at a society and infrastructure level) before you can expect frequent Bitcoin payments while working in an industry not at all related to Bitcoin.   And I'll be damaged if Mr. Rich didn't pull out his cigarette lighter right there and light that award on **fire**...   Look at the cats body language. It is clearly scared of the person holding the camera. Whoever took this photo, intentionally sprayed this cat with shaving cream, like an inhumane piece of shit.   The cats nose is scratched up and there's shaving cream in it's fucking eye.  It is also sprayed fresh underneath the toilet on the wall showing it was being sprayed from well above ground level.   And the fresh out of the jar clumps on the metal bar hanging from the toilet. Someone was clearly holding it in the air while it was being sprayed.   Don't lie, you shaving creamed that cat. You're a scumbag.   It's nose is all fucked up too, not to mention shaving cream in it's eye.   Karma's a bitch.   What kind of classic car is that in the door reflection?   Money orders cost like 75 cents and you can get them many places, for example WaWa.   We are the galactic n00bs.   By the time your bad luck runs out, New York City will be under water due to global warming.   Flamed 'em.   When you get out of the car, put a piece of tinfoil over the shift knob.    Lord Varder of Pie   I like your jibs, m8.   /u/Lord_of_pie for ~~president~~ Head of State.     And venomous/deadly wildlife, as far as the eye can see.    Weird! I had a friend who had an old creepy wooden door in her room that led to the attic. I remember very vividly a story she told me that involved an instance of heavy knocking on that door which scared her badly. The door was never used and she was home alone. Old suburban house in an area heavily used during the revolutionary war.   Niice   If she's got 2 kids... she definitely isn't allergic to nuts.  See what I did there??   So make it on a smaller fucking budget.   Update, OP! Is he blind 4 lyfe?   I just picked up /u/JawnDenver a couple weeks ago.   Haha, well done.    Bruce.... Wayne?   Man, you must be bored. Isn't there another thread you could be sucking the fun out of?   Damn, didn't even get to try the board?   This is the kind of post I'm looking for.    True stories only. The more detailed, the better.   Yea, it's Rhonda Rousey   10 golds! Much wealth!   My man. Keeping it responsible.    Good on you, man. It's an expensive habit. Just don't let it get the best of you and you'll be alright. Pretty bad for your body though being that anything you get in the US is probably more than 50% cut.   Unfortunately not. Wore them out playing elementary/middle school basketball. Must have been 18 years ago.   The original [Iverson Answer 1's](http://www.sneakerglossary.com/pictures/Allen-Iverson-Reebok-Answer-1-White-Red-Gold-shoes.jpg).  Thanks Grandma! You da best.   That'll show those tiny dicked bastards.    This guy is going places in life.   This thing looks like it would try to swim up my pee hole. With disastrous results.     Mush, my pretties! Muahahaha   I knew a Cokehead Rob once upon a time. Until he got really shady and started robbing his band mates. Cocaines a hell of a drug?  	126
 Oh my god, now you mention it, I think he might have had two hands on my shoulders at the time as well...   More comfy than a finger up the bum, I guess, although it'd depend who you ask.      Or second-gear-power-up-wheelstand-level torque.   He's awesome, I don't think it's taking anything away from Davis to say that Westbrook would have been absolutely unhinged in the playoffs.   Can you imagine the Beastbrook we would have seen in the first round though? Would've been more fun to watch than the Pelis' first wobbly steps.   ...but he goes into potato mode and cruises during the regular season.       This was all shot with the camera on auto, it's tough to work out exposure etc using a small phone display outdoors.  Immediate things I noticed: DJI Pilot automatically saves the video to your phone/tablet, which absolutely destroys the battery. My Note 4 died before I got the third battery into the Phantom. The ultrasonic sensor/visual positioning thing screws with your shots if you're trying to fly smoothly, best to turn it off or fly in attitude if you're looking for stable footage.  A fair bit of chromatic aberration in the final image, and it really doesn't like being pointed into the sun. I was happy to discover after my phone ran out that it'll fly without the phone connected, and because there's a record button on the controller, you can still film even if you can't see - the last 5 or 6 clips were done blind.  Oh, and it hates taking off on a slanted surface. Out in the bush I couldn't find a totally flat spot for liftoff, and the little "whoosh whoosh" warmup routine it does when you start the props ended up tipping it over. Grrrrr. Anyway hope that's helpful to somebody!      Brace yourself for more lead changes than you're gonna be able to deal with.    I don't think Bron has peaked yet.       Neptune's orbit is the final planet - it's about 4.5 billion kilometers out. Voyager 1 is 19.6 billion km away. So it's more than 4 times further away than the final planet in the system. We tried to illustrate it here at about 5.35:  https://youtu.be/eKiJQ8m3FUo   It won't overtake Voyager 1.      Doesn't cost heaps? Aw. I want some proper mountains.    The key is to buy one before 4, and then microwave it.   *dominant   That... Made me cry for some reason.   Probably fellas without a whole lot of self confidence practicing talking to girls. If they're not being arseholes about it then good on 'em!   Worst mistake you can make right now is not calling the brother. Doesn't matter if you have nothing to say. Just offer to help any way you can.    Somebody spent a lot of time making that video, and by re-uploading it you've ensured they don't get any youtube revenue, or effectively any credit for their work. People who are interested have no way to find them. I think that's shitty form.   The series of plays leading up to "the shot" by MJ - he and Craig Ehlo were trading punches for something like the previous 6 baskets, each one more ridiculous than the last. Ehlo had every right to walk away the winner in that contest, he played his heart out. And that's why that hanging-in-mid-air, freakish dagger was such an incredible finish.   Reminds me of my old Hornet 900. Personally I'd like to do something even flatter like the Monster 1200 headlight on mine. But I won't. Because I'm lazy. Kudos to you for pulling your finger out and doing the thing!   Do you have a full license, or will you be starting from scratch? You can get a second hand bike from about 3.5k for something decent.    Man, he's singing so soft. Again and again that speech level stuff comes up.   Don't forget, he coasts like he's on holiday for the first half of the season.    He was inspirational. And he had that loose 90s style going on. Always loved watching him play.    Happens to me all the time. Be very surprised if you find a way to spin a buck out of it.   Borrie seems to have slowed down on those lately... Honestly making good video for the Web is bad business right now. Bloody hard to make it pay for itself.   You and I seem forever entwined in Internet comments. Looking forward to your next vids!   Glad you liked it - I finally went and put my money where my mouth is and bought one too. :)   Well I think that's what everyone's expecting... Me included. But you never know, maybe he's one of those sensitive types who just needed somebody to believe in him... And fellate him endlessly. And he sure seems to have found that.   Maybe if he spends four times more than the cap on salaries, the best player in the world will have a stacked enough team to win.    Just imagine if this tidal wave of positivity actually works... DJ starts believing the hype train and acting like he's a few key skills away from being the best center img the world. He's knocking on the door of the shooting coaches. He's doing the Olajuwon camp and getting post moves together... Who knows, I can see some bizarre universe where this kind of kick in the arse/kiss on the arse actually motivates him to get better.    I took one out for a couple days back when they were still solvent - they're a nice ride!   Supposed to be a lot better than the FZ09/MT09.   10C is a great product - but it's not as good a headset as the 20S, and it's not as good a camera as a GoPro. The headset is similar in quality and usability to the SMH-10, so it's no bad thing, it just doesn't have the huge 2km range and voice controls of the 20S.  If you don't need pro quality vision I think it's an awesome and very convenient piece of kit. Very easy to use.   Why would anyone care?    There's no such thing as bad publicity. She's becoming a household name.    Dominique's 2-handed windmill blew my young mind.    I don't think he'd fit in. Needs a more punchable face.    Can somebody explain why you guys give a shit who tweets this crap first?    Black skin, asian eyes.    In your face AGAIN Danny.    SBK is by far the better event to attend for the Australian round. Less people paying to be seen there, less corporate clowns, more motorcycle lovers. You can ride your bike around the outside of the track and go to a bunch of different spots on the day.   There's nothing cool about something so contrived.   It's just so contrived, he's going the other direction and he turns around deliberately so he can step over Varejao and manufacture an Iverson/Pippen moment. Sorry, but I see this and just think 'wanker.'   We were all hoping he'd go to the Bulls and give whatever shitty superteam Lebron is on at least SOME contest on the march to the finals.   He does come across... A bit malignant.   You're like my nephew when he was 1. Ball was his only word for about 2 months. Everything was a fucking ball.   Coming for wintertime? Rug up, mate. Melbourne doesn't really freeze, but our winters are fucking depressing.   https://youtu.be/6Ua_oJfpQWY   Between the two of them they might get a whole 82 games.   Wait for Lebron to decide not to run the offense.    I wish I'd had the foresight to take a photo so the turd could thank you poosonally.    Great piece. Foul and educational. A great combo, you have improved my morning shit immeasurably.    The Maron interview sheds a lot of light on this. I don't think you can relegate this guy to "he just does fart jokes" status. Between Wayne's World, Austin Powers and Shrek alone he's created what, 10 or 12 brilliant characters that have all crossed straight into pop culture. The guy is a genius and his vision is incredibly strong. If he wants to fight for his ideas I think he's earned the right.    I think we should all be thankful Donald Sterling never realised he could call his team that.    NUCULAR   A rich, young, famous and disgraced millionaire, at least to start with. His last few bits of task national exposure were spent making a fool of himself.    He's a wonderful combination of arrogant, I'm-the-best-fear-my-wrath bluster, mixed with a comically mercenary habit of ditching his team to play with other huge talents or recruiting like mad to stack his own team. There's nothing organic or real about the teams he won titles with, and this year he "came home" by gutting the shit out of Cleveland's roster and stacking that to the rafters as well.   I respect his court vision, his outrageous physical gifts and his ability to make big plays at important times, but I hate his bullying style of driving to the rim and just bashing his way in. There's nothing pretty about the way he finishes to me.   I love nothing more than watching him get shat on, looking forward to seeing it again, hopefully in an earlier round of the playoffs. Also looking forward to watching Cleveland struggle with massive salary issues in the wake of GM James wanting more talent and more money at the same time.    http://static.celebuzz.com/uploads/2013/05/11/gatsby-leo-051113.gif   I think he's deleted his account?   Pfffffft deleted his account?   I noted a lot of love for SoTC on here so I went and bought it... Didn't even finish it - and I'm a compulsive game finisher. Shadow of the Colossus and the God of War games are the only things I can remember playing in recent times that I couldn't bring myself to finish.   I dunno about this for LA. Matt Barnes is a good enforcer, a grit guy with that bit of desperation and edge the Clippers sometimes struggle for. Their best wing defender too, he's gonna be missed a lot more than Hawes.   Yeah, a Lebron heave is actually a good shot for the Warriors. They're OK with how this is going.   Lebron is playing against a defense here that has decided not to double him, even when he's posting up a guard. They've picked their poison and decided to let him score.    I haven't ridden an H2, I'm sure they're berserk as well. H2R even more so.    You're saying this like he doesn't already.   Lebron shooting is still a good outcome for GS - he's shooting terribly. 14 for 34 tonight. Golden State's offense is what's killing them.   Present!   It doesn't matter, the strobe freezes the action.    My missus has learned and mastered the stretch'n'rake. I can't imagine a more luxurious way to start the morning than having somebody else expertly scratch your ballbag.    ...but the vast majority of the world went through the Gretzky era and still gave no fucks about hockey.   Seems like harrassment needs to become part of the D strategy for GSW - they've got the manpower to annoy him if necessary.   I spent last week doing my RPA license course... I don't think unlicensed operators are gonna realise just how much controlled airspace there is. Here's a quick look at Melbourne, for example, the first legal bits of sky are out as far as Brighton or Williamstown. Forget about going North, there's a wide controlled zone around Melbourne airport. http://i.imgur.com/jIbQAUG.jpg  People are just going to break the laws that are left, and not get caught. CASA seems insanely understaffed as it is (it's taking them 6 months to put a stamp on an Operator Certificate at the moment) - there's no way they'll be chasing every guy with 2 drone shots in his video that look like they were taken near a building, or within 3 nautical miles from a helipad.  Meanwhile, those of us that slogged through the process will still be obliged to plan, risk assess and log every flight and the charge levels of our batteries, wait our 30 days for area approvals and whatnot. I dunno how rational it's all looking to be honest.   Not only that, they're slowing the tempo enough to get rest on offense.   I forgot all about that! Awesome!   Original bet here: http://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/2seq1l/nba_on_espn_warriors_are_now_305_of_18_previous/cnow5qi?context=3  Damnit, I should have hedged with a bet on the cavs too, so that my burning hate and fury if they win would at least be slightly quenched by some guy running around in a cockenballs hat.   True! The exception not the rule though. I hope he gets a bit of mongrel into him.   He's a bit of a humbledunker at this point, I'd like to see him get a bit nastier.    He's French. That's like borrowing a set of spanners over there.    With no regard for human kneecap.    He's a bit of a freak.    You almost want your bigs to start late. Less mileage on the joints!    To be fair it was an impact injury not an aggravation of his tendinitis.    And what if he drops his bundle like last year?    Better not star Jack Marston.   That's how the king operates though. Looking forward to seeing what new team stacking measures are undertaken in the off season. It just makes him so easy to root against.    I got to 3 minutes once in a particularly boring English class.    Wow.    Acknowledged and enjoyed. He's trash.    Don't forget Tristan Thompson. Every time the warriors got a rebound it felt like a fluke.    You are quite the diplomat.    That was a pretty shit game by the warriors. I felt they were lucky to take it. Steph never got going and they needed a couple of Iggy threes to stay in the hunt.  Lebron beasted, Thompson made me feel like golden state was lucky to get a defensive board, Smith regressed to the mean and the whole Cavs team dropped their bundle when Kyrie went down.    Good luck to the guy if they ever charge him and it gets to the papers. He'll never sleep another sound night.    Fuckin' pricks. Ruined a $500 set of motorcycle tyres.    To me this reads more like a power play. He's basically calling her a whore and naming an insulting price. This is a cunt of a man trying to assert dominance over a woman and remind her of her place. It's pretty fucking gross behavior.    Thanks mate!    That track just leaves me in awe. The whole album does. William Orbit is a genius.    You didn't scroll far enough, it got kinda heated in here! ;) But cheers.    Mucho appreciande!    It's amazing. Last week I posted a musical fart that got 2 million views, and the comments were overwhelmingly positive.   Twas dad. I chopped the video up a bit to keep it short and stuck bits of audio on top of each other, so you're hearing my voice from one bit and my beats from another. Lucky we stayed in the groove!    Don't worry, he's totally gross, full of dirt and bugs and healthy as an ox. :)   Yeah just thought it'd give people a smile. But it's a fair point!    I'll have a look in the morning.    Babies are naked heaps. Any awkwardness is a sad reflection on modern values.    No idea. It's a fairly new bathroom though.    Yeah I'm with you now. This post has been a learning experience.    I was feeling guilty about making a video my kid will be mortified about when he's a teenager. Now it turns out it's a PSA about electrocuting babies.    Baby was not electrocuted, but I think we can all agree it was a dumbass thing to do and not recommended. Our parenting skills are an example of why there should be reproduction license tests.    Probably have to post video to a different sub.    Righto cheers! Last thing I'd want is for somebody else to go zap their kid. Actually that's the second last really.    I think we're safe, it's meant to be stuck in wet stuff.   Edit: NOT SAFE.   HALLLLOOOOOO  	119
 What ways did you find it better than the first? Did it have more action? was it faster moving? no spoilers if possible ^.^   I started this book after Sanderson doing a great job of finishing the wheel of time series.  To be honest I expected something very similar to the Wheel of Time books in this book. Instead I found a very intriguing world that was slowly built up. There was a lack of "action" but i always found myself interested in where the story was taking me and as clues fell into place I started to piece together the larger story. I'm very interested to see where the 2nd book goes from here and if develops in the same way.   i think the big twist is that brock put in his rematch clause and any technical rematch should have roman reigns since he was in the first match   and the engaged on the lulu and the reksai...which gragas and ali...no chance of killing either of those two..those last 3 fights were painful.   That's a very helpful link. I think I could have bought the flying courier since at 4:31 i bought sage's mask as part of my soul ring recipe.   Inivisible Man by Ralph Ellison. Read during High School at a point in time where I did not have a lot of confidence and was struggling with my identity... I'll always love the quote:  "And my problem was that I always tried to go in everyones way but my own. I have also been called one thing and then another while no one really wished to hear what I called myself. So after years of trying to adopt the opinions of others I finally rebelled. I am an invisible man"   I haven't seen anyone talking about it so I figured I'd post it to at least get the convo started...      Recently I played a game as support Skywrath. http://www.dotabuff.com/matches/1596931228  At the end of the game I have Eul's, Force Staff, Scythe of Vyse, soul ring, Tranquil Boots, and Agh's. This was a hour long game but I feel like i have too many items. I placed at least 8 wards during the game since that was my compendium challenge, I know had some sentries for a while that i was using to secure vision in certain areas like near Rosh. I pulled some camps during the start of the game..I just feel like I didnt buy enough sentries or was missing something i should have been doing.  I bought my items for the following reasons: soul ring + tranquils: allows me to harass in lane a lot while keeping mana up  eul's: my idea was to hopefully eul's the sk while he was channelling epi or keep me to safe to allow my cooldowns to come back up  force: maneuverability/safety for carries  scythe: the enemy team had a storm that was carrying..wanted to use my silence + scythe to focus him down  aghs: late game had 4k gold just chilling there   Duclaw Sweet baby jesus beer is very chocolatey   I've been watching a couple streams including HR's recent dotapit match against C9 where they picked Huskar. Huskar is part of my Compendium 10 hero challenge so I was particularly interested in this match. Thoroughout the match the commentators frequently commented about how good Huskar's "Armlet Toggling" was. From context clue's I figured it has to do with the active of Armlet but what is it? Why is it good? How should Huskar correctly use it?   i think if Freddy keeps pushing with the minions sk wins...   as long as you have just black coffee you should be fine..if you add sugar and creamers then you just need to account for those calories over time...  as for what your eating...i would guess that you are probably not eating "too few" calories as most people underestimate calories they are eating especially when it comes to snacks.   but here's real talk..are you taking pictures of yourself every 30 days? Are you taking measurements(ie waste size, bicep size) every 30 days? If all you're doing is looking at the scale you may "see the results" but you will be getting them.  If i recall correctly I had a maybe 5-10lb change after the whole 90 days..but my body looked significantly different  [my result pics for reference](http://imgur.com/a/6lGX5)    Hi! I play League as well(Silver 4 noob) and will try to address some of your questions.  * playing support is one of the most knowledged based roles in dota2. Similar to how in league you need to know how to ward/keep dragon nashor timers/keep flash timers/level 2 rush there is a lot to know in dota2(smoke, dust, sentries, ward positions, jungle pulls). I would avoid playing hard support until you get a little more familiarity with the game  * Similar to LoL, bots is useful for playing a hero for the first time and figuring out how that hero works. If you go against a hero and are having a hard time play that hero in a bot game to figure out his skills  * if you are having a hard time with builds dota has an answer for that once you enter the game [click the book in the upper left hand corner](http://i.ytimg.com/vi/l0k2TUvkc4E/maxresdefault.jpg). this will provide you with a selection of the highest recommended builds which usually have item progressions as well as explanations for that item. Also it even highlights the ability it suggests you learn at each level  hopefully some of these tips will help you out :)   If you like bbc show's i highly recommend Orphan Black and Broadchurch      ok i think the ground toss was my issue thank you    i know it says that but like i said sometimes i'll have another player right next to me and it wont let me cast it. Do i have to have my reticle on the character i want to throw or in the direction i want to throw them? both ways seem to not work consistently for me    how on earth do i get tiny's toss to do what i want...I'll have characters right next to me and it wont throw them or anything   and giving up wide open layups for 3s   ooh...whoosh..I'm...nevermind   i think you mean       if (greaterBashChance = DEFAULT_BASH_CHANCE)  the way you have it written would mean a 83% chance of doing greater bash   he also missed the 7 steps super obvious travel that happened right before that....   NME really struggled to break into TDK's base. Bard was just throwing ultis out that had no chance of hitting...the poor play in the game led to phreak deciding to making it pun time with phreak and it was just bad.   It's germ thing. It's the reason he always fist bumps when they go to the opponents.   I highly suggest Powers by Brian Michael Bendis. The story is set in a world where superheroes/supervillians exist and follows the story of two cops in that world that are assigned to cases dealing with those with "Powers"  if you like Watchmen you may also like V for Vendetta, The League of Extraordinary Gentleman.   The Frank Miller Daredevil is also quite good and I personally like Batman Knightfall   I also think the ryze vs mao matchup is poor for ryze bc his constant spells trigger mao's passive a lot and mao has good engage/lockup for ganks   you should show your wife a Roy Nelson UFC fight and watch her head explode lol   its also on $60 on amazon...http://www.amazon.com/Locke-Key-Slipcase-Set-Hill/dp/1631401394  i just bought this a couple weeks ago :)      i'm almost mad i bought the Locke and Key physical set a couple weeks ago...almost lol   if you lack energy but feel full i would suggest raising your carbs slightly(add a sweet potato to breakfast or lunch)  EDIT: also if you dont usually eat clean and are switching to clean eating, the first 10 days you can expect to feel a little groggy as you're basically going through detox on sugars   i use Optimum Nutrition protein powder with almond milk, I use a real blender so i add banana and lots of spinach to mine too   I believe PapaSmithy is able to do a good(not great) level of PBP. They question is whether the extra analysis makes up for a potential dip in PBP   where are you watching the episodes from? I cant find a legal way to watch season 2 right now :(   np, actually watching your OHP video it looks like your overarching your back..watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExgCyO0s9m0) and notice how her back stays rigid   not sure it's a big issue but I would work on having a solid foundation when unracking the weight. On a squat get into a squat position under the bar and then lift to make sure you are in good position...same with OHP, get into that front rack position like a front squat and then use legs to lift weight out of rack  squat: crank your elbows down a bit, this is going to help you keep your frame upright. on a couple reps(especially the last one) it appeared like the weight got forward of you and you were doing a good morning   here's the link to my p90x results: http://imgur.com/a/6lGX5  I've also done SS, ICF, and then have done crossfit for 2 years. What I've found is that whatever motivates you to get into the gym/workout consistently is what's the "best" and gets you the best results.  If you want to try to do p90x and money is no issue I would HIGHLY suggest doing the p90x/Insanity hyrbid plan to get most results quickly   first person to get title right!    honestly i almost posted this picture to /r/mildlyinfuriating just for that reason   Every 6k "health miles" we get a $25 gift card to a business on a approved list. You can get 100 health miles just for being active for a 45 minute span with out stopping or 120 health miles if you go 12k steps in a day(roughly 5-6 miles) etc etc   I haven't..but it's was suggested to me from the same person who suggested I try Powers and Preacher and i enjoyed both those   yup. was priced at $99 a couple weeks ago. They lowered it to [$60](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1631401394) and my work gives us amazon gift cards based off wearing a pedometer and how far we walk :)    You replied to me in 2 places but i'll condense my reply here :). While I agree for heroes the 96k number looks good the question is "Is it a good number for ESPN2?" ESPN2 averaged 212k viewers on Sunday and a 30for30 repeat last week in the same time spot averaged 300k+ viewers. I'm just not sure if the 96k makes ESPN2 more likely to show another Heroes event. If that entire 96k is in the 18-35 demo then it might be a win for ESPN2 based on how highly they covet that demo       according to the link below and rerun of a 30for30 documentary from 9:30-10pm on April 19 had 313k viewers: http://sportstvratings.com/spurs-clippers-trail-blazers-grizzlies-nets-hawks-nascar-lead-cable-sports-nets-for-sunday-april-19-2015/2136/   I'm not sure if you can answer this but how are player contracts set to pay out? Does a player who is a starter week 1 make the same amount if they are relegated to the bench? Or is pay based on performance?   a replay of a basketball game got the same veiwership...i actaully view this number as bad :-/ https://twitter.com/Ourand_SBJ/status/593110495189676032   worse: https://twitter.com/Ourand_SBJ/status/593110495189676032   i would disagree: https://twitter.com/Ourand_SBJ/status/593110495189676032   i actually used this line on my current gf...can confirm it works   fun fact..McDonalds registers dont allow you to order more than 99 of any one item in a single order...or at least that was the case in 2006 when we ordered 102 cheeseburgers   and Jae Crowder(who's been doing great this playoffs) and a 1st round draft pick and 2nd round draftpick(not like we need young legs anyways)..oh and Jameer nelson's carcass   thanks for creating these..is it possible to get end game pics that have items vs gold total? even if it's a few seconds before the game actually end i feel the item pic would be preferred :)   i started getting this around the time the mass friend request spam was happening and it hasnt gone away since then   Honestly I was happy..I never liked any of those characters..especially Lady stark   i was having issues with the network and did the following to fix my issues:  right click on video-choose settings-make sure the "enable hardware acceleration" option is NOT selected. Refresh stream   what about the game freeze on log in that came with the invites? I'm still getting the freeze even though invites aren't happening   That 3rd dragon was definitely not worth...should of just gave it up and turtled..went from 2k gold deficit to 10k deficit   I'm pretty sure it is not an april fools joke   wasn't super impressed with him in their game vs ODU. He is good shooting the 3 when going to his right and didnt look overly physical/atheletic   true but i wasn't watching the teams twitters. i only went there because the message from them during live broadcast   he was checking twitter bc they told us on bradcast to specifically follow lolesports to find when VOD would be available..   Same I'm quite frustrated   incredibly frustrating   I was really happy to learn MSI was on east coast and then instantly disappointed when it was in Tallahassee    they are gonna be awfully disappointed if they expect Sheamus to be cheered at WM   ah my last match is almost exactly a month ago so that makes sense   yes   except now there are no item drops :(   they made it so you couldn't warp high ground with out vision of it and you couldn't warp on ramp to get high ground vision..as soon as that change went in 4 gate basically disappeared   there is no LCS this week   I'm not saying he shouldn't get the undergrad degree..I'm saying real world experience pays the bills a lot more than a PhD would.   bad idea to get a PhD in computer science unless you are wanting to be a professor. In computer science the amount your paid is usually directly related to your real world experience coding. You would benefit better from starting to learn some type of programming on your own(ie create a github project where you develop an android app, create a video game using the newly free Unreal Engine 4,etc)    I'm surprised you dont have any FABLES. How is Locke and Key? I'm starting to think about grabbing it   but in bot lane for instance you can trade trinket ward coverage of tri with your adc to have pretty constant vision..so still not reportable   I dont know the actual position for the 3D groups but you would want something like simulation engineer. In case you aren't aware of it: http://nasajobs.nasa.gov/   I have a double degree in electrical and computer engineering with a minor in modeling and simulation    RAM is synonymous with memory and the more of it you have the more programs can be running at any one point on your computer.   	79
       I agree that in the somewhat improved reporting environment it is more difficult to claim revolutionary benefits from a marginal drug. Given that so many of the psychoactive medications have been so disappointing from a short-term perspective, and often alarming from a long-term one, the field must look unpromising to many companies.   You are also right that the dominant driving neurochemical theories behind depression have not been supported, making it difficult to know where to look for a new antidepressant.   The problem is not limited to psychopharmacology, however. My understanding is that new "blockbuster" drugs are becoming harder and harder to find in all fields. This means either declining prospects for the pharmaceutical companies - or an increased motive to cheerlead and overmarket the products they have.         Yes, the DSM people seem to be on track to the creation of the "perfect" manual: One in which all of us will be able to find ourselves and thereby self-identify as mentally ill.   This is a nicely thought-out argument that I think has some real validity. You may be interested to read Alain de Botton's excellent book "The Pleasures and Sorrows of Work" which includes a discussion of this idea of disconnection from the products of one's work life.         I would agree that the quality of diagnostic work has not gone up overall. Most people are given a diagnosis after a very short unstructured discussion of a few minutes, and a screening tool such as the PHQ9 that should not be used for diagnosis.  Whereas formerly depression may often have been missed, however, today it is more likely to be identified where it is not present. There have been some studies indicating that the majority of people identified as suffering from depression do not meet criteria. As well, the criteria themselves have been expanded since the 1950s - though I do not believe this can account for all of the increase in numbers.  At our clinic, the majority of people referred with a diagnosis of major depression do not seem, with structured interview, to meet nor to have ever met the diagnostic criteria for the disorder. When it comes to bipolar 2 disorder, that number climbs to, at a guess, closer to 75%.   The GAPS diet is one of many broad-range idea systems developed and promoted by an iconoclastic originator and promoted via the internet. For those interested, here is a skeptical view: http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/gaps-diet/   Certainly in the 1950s this kind of thing wasn't looked for with any regularity and I do think much was missed back then.   I'm not sure, though, that we are getting so much better at diagnosis. Most of the clients I am referred with a diagnosis of Major Depression (on the basis of 5 minute GP interview or PHQ9 questionnaire) do not, with proper structured interview, turn out to have (or have ever had) MDD. I suspect we're getting better at OVER diagnosis, and at pathologizing normal reactive declines in mood and then encouraging the sale of products (including medications) for these. Nowhere is this more evident than in the recent fad diagnosis of Bipolar 2 Disorder, but I think that unipolar depression is also being over-recognized and prematurely medicated.  Most of the outcome literature on antidepressant medication is based on short-term response, with the assumption being that this gives us an indication what long-term outcomes will be. But the evidence favouring long-term maintenance treatment with antidepressants (or antidepressant-antipsychotic cocktails - which seem easier to get in Vancouver than margaritas) has always been shaky.   Could down-regulation (reactive to medication) in serotonergic and noradrenergic systems be accounting for some of the increased chronicity and poorer interepisode recovery?      Something chemical is surely going on with every psychological experience we have - so if someone asks "does depression have a chemical component" the answer is always yes. So does love.  The biochemical imbalance explanation derives from the marketing wing of the pharmaceutical companies, not from the research wing. I regard it as a litmus test of the quality of care: If a healthcare provider says something to the effect of "You have a biochemical imbalance" they simply do not know the literature and should not be treating the disorder.  There have been many attempts to nail down the supposed biochemical aspect of depression, to no real avail. There is no serotonin deficiency, nor excess of monoamine oxidase, nor excessive reuptake transporters, as far as we can tell.   The SSRIs DO work for some of the people who take them in both the short and long term. Others find they help short term but are ineffective long term. Still others find the long term results are worse than not having the medications. And increasingly the pattern is to react to nonresponse by raising dosage or adding supplementary medications such as antipsychotics - significantly ramping up the risk or actuality of side effects while augmenting any antidepressant effect very little if at all.  I often ask patients and providers if there is any "off-signal" - a sign that perhaps medication is not going to prove helpful and perhaps the best course is to withdraw medications gradually and work another way. I have never yet had anyone say "yes." But I keep asking.   Relax, breathe, and say what comes to mind. Let it be incoherent. Part of the role of therapy is to help you sort through the confusion that everyone's life is. Like having "Mobile Maids" come and help you clean up after a cyclone.   Oh, and no one expects you to open up completely the first time you meet a therapist. That's not compliance - that's not having any boundaries. Feel free to save up some stuff for when you trust them more and get a sense you can work with them. Don't wait too long, though, or you can waste a lot of time in therapy working on less-central issues.    Thank your physician for talking you into this prior to working with medication dosage.   A first appointment with a counsellor (I am one) usually involves an attempt to understand what's basically going on. My own assessment can be summed by a few basic questions:  What have you been experiencing that brings you here? What has the course of this problem been (when did it start, intensify, etc)? What was going on around the time it started or worsened? What seems to help so far, if anything? Did anything improve or worsen when other treatment began? What's your guess about what's really going on here? What would you most like to get out of seeing me?  None of those can be answered completely in one short session, and no good therapist will expect you to be completely organized. But thinking about those questions in advance will usually help you make the most of your first meeting.   Note, though, that the first meeting is not usually much about treatment - it's more of an info-gathering session. Expect more of an initial sketch of suggested approaches in session 2.   Your description sounds very much like the reactions described in Robert Whitaker's Anatomy of an Epidemic. I can't offer any advice, but I think it's useful for people to ask which of their symptoms was present before being on medication, which only appeared after they began medication, and which disappeared or reduced as an apparent result of medication - and for how long (given that some medication effects, even beneficial ones - are short-acting). This can help with treatment decision-making.     	19

Check comments, someone posted them :)         I saved the pic from a blog post a while ago but when I looked for more info this morning the blog had been reorganized or something and I couldn't find any info. I thought it was from the AVG in China Air Force in early WWII                  I heard there was a Twins part 2 in the works with the possibility of Eddie Murphy as an unknown brother? Sounds good to me.   Yea, you can't edit a title once it's posted and I didn't want to go through the hassle of deleting and reposting. People seem to be having some fun with it so I left it. Have a boon day!   I would have them pick one to be read to them at night. As a kid when I stayed with my grandparents at their cabin upstate they let me pick a book for them to read to me from their book shelf. To this day I get the feels whenever I watch Princess Bride.

Yea it looks great. Just found this sub but it already looks like a lot of fun. The guys who can actually use a pad without letters and numbers boggle my mind!   THANKS! That's exactly what I was hoping looking for!   I was really hoping that wouldn't be the case.   Been watching videos for a while now and it finally got out of Beta, joined, got a ship and played in two battles before I had to give up or the laptop was going out the window. It's a 2007 Toshiba Satellite X205-S7483 Laptop setup for Gaming but I didn't play any games (is an XBox player) but I'm hoping it's not going to be to hard to upgrade. Any advice is really helpful, thanks. There's a Micro Center in my neighborhood I'm heading to soon but I thought I would ask here first, thanks.   Joined World of Warships and it looks like a bad wii game, lagging, freezing. how hard is it going to be to try upgrading the video card, laptop itself to play really well?   i really like some of the boards you guys have set up and I'm hoping to get some good ideas. I want to write alot and play World of Warships on my laptop. Love the wooden boards!   New to this great subreddit and I'm looking to (hopefully) upgrade 2007 Toshiba Satellite Laptop for online gaming and I hope you guys can help with some recommendations. Thanks.         Right, now that's a food fair! I'm hoping that Anthony Bourdain, who really appreciates this kind of street food, that when he puts his food pavilion together it will be with this kind of stuff http://ny.eater.com/2015/4/9/8376063/bourdain-market-anthony-bourdain-new-york-city         Bingo!         Wow, who would do that? And why?   It's how I ordered a chicken sandwich at my local joint in Brooklyn. They make it with pickled turnip which is to hard to eat but overall a great sandwich.       I mean what do you do, Get a hose or just pull up next to an open hydrant?   Ohh, that come hither look!         I hope they had a sense of humor about it.      Happened to me once when I was following a large truck through a flooded area and he decides that would be a good time to stop in the middle of it to lean out and take a pic. The wave back washed even higher than the normal level and I got stuck. Parked it after tow on high ground, turned out the tailpipe and muffler got filled, replaced that and drove it for 5 more years. Check the muffler.   Like I needed another reason to go to Spain. Those are now on the list, thanks!      Does it have to be today? Recently http://imgur.com/7201BYm and I did upvote the "fuck you pay me" because Goodfellas!   http://nedhardy.com/2015/06/29/the-dogs-that-ride-the-subway-in-russia/      http://nedhardy.com/2015/06/29/the-dogs-that-ride-the-subway-in-russia/            Surprisingly not overly sweet but with a real butterscotch taste to it. Plus it was ice cold and just hit the spot after eating tons of olives, sharp cheeses and pate. It's made by the same people who make Reed's Ginger Brew, if you like a strong ginger ale you have to try it! http://reedsinc.com/   Just surfing youtube and no I didn't film it. Sorry.      I was an EMT working the tri state area but the base was in New Jersey, after a while I was trusted to take the ambulance home, I lived in Brooklyn. Having sex in the back of the ambulance while on the clock is an incredible thrill that I miss.   I believe it's prepared the French way and I think the cheese is cheddar and brie. I'm hoping someone sees this and knows exactly what's in it and how it's made.   The two main floors plus the smaller (only about 100 vendors) room to the right on the ground level. We got there right after they opened and when they flicked the lights to let us know they were closing we still hadn't seen everything. That's why it's three days long. I just wished I was able to go everyday but that was impossible this year. Try going to the International Restaurant and Equipment Show when it comes next year, you can eat better there also, if a company's got an oven to try and sell you he's gonna have fresh pizza or meat on a grill all day long. Plus when I got my badge scanned i got a 1lb package of Apple Wood Smoked Bacon from a Wisconsin Company as a surprise a month later. Saved that for BLT on the wife's birthday! Last year there was a Canadian company trying to introduce their answer to a pastrami sandwich, they sell you a case of already cooked flash frozen prepared pastrami in an 8oz plastic bag, just have a pot of boiling water ready and when a customer wants a sandwich just pop one or two in the water depending on the size of your sandwich and wait for a few minutes until reheated and wham, a hot pastrami sandwich on order with no waste and no need to worry about expiration dates. Plus the pastrami was pretty good. I'll check to see if I have any pics from that show. Again it's just for professionals only.      About 10 minutes but I bet the duck on the bottom is nice and crispy and the hunk of cheese on top is just melted enough! Mouthwatering!      There were a few Honey products and companies but I don't remember them offhand, sorry. Friends?   the pics look great but the food tasted even better!

    Neil degrasse Tyson. 72 hours straight.    I went to see Wall Street money never sleeps alone. I just said screw it I wanna goto the movies and I put on some pajamas. It was the most relaxing thing I ever to did.    Try taking some weight off then try again. Failing a set is part of the program no matter how early. Just deload then try again.    Definately gonna see this. Simon Pegg is awesome.    My wife didn't know bacon came from pigs, but from cows.....yea I didn't believe her wen she told me.    Ccleaner. Avast. Malwarebytes.

 well what else should I have said, I was bored? because thats the only other way to describe it. Much of Age of Ultron was boring and dull.    Not sure about you guys but I'm getting a bit tired of the avengers fighting a large army I'm hoping infinity war will rectify that with Thanos all I want is the aveners vs Thanos thats it.But with AOU I think I was starting to get a bit superhero fatigue because there were just so many heroes involved.   I like how Ant-Man went back to basics. It was small up close and personal and it was a solid origin story and it was just overall a more enjoyable film for me.      Christoph Waltz will be the main villain in spectre while Andrew Scott will be teased and introduced in spectre as the man behind the mask sorta thing the guy pulling the strings the puppeteer if you will and hell be the main villain in bond 25.    someones salty. jelous you wont be going? aw.    wow. thats nuts.          Ill be pissed if winter soldier was just a fluke and the russo brothers end up being the worst directors ever .   no      Damn I forgot how good the first season was. So many great moments. The hood vs the dark archer, the introduction of the huntress. Slade Wilson, Shadow. what are your favorite moments from season 1?   its the beard.   The game was announced for ps4 last year for those that didn't know http://au.ign.com/articles/2014/08/12/day-z-coming-to-playstation-4   correct me if i'm wrong but from the looks of things the game is pretty much dead on PC but id still like to give it a go on ps4 if it ever comes out. Has there been any updates on the ps4 version?    Actually feige said marvel will do it if audiences want it. "a supercool idea for the next Ant-Man film, and if audiences want it, well find a place to do it."  http://www.fandango.com/movie-news/interview-marvel-studios-president-kevin-feige-on-ant-man-doctor-strange-and-more-749486   If ant-man 2 happens 2018 would be the most logical date. There is usually 2 years inbetween marvel sequels. That means marvel would be moving 2 4 films a year. How crazy would that be.   So I watched this a couple of nights ago and I gotta say its now one of my favorite DC animated movies. The plot twist was pretty predictable but that didn't take away from the movie though.Some people say the joker was miscast in this but I actually enjoyed the voice actor they chose same for Batman both were really solid.  Its a great animated feature and you guys should most definitely watch it.    well just know that your opinion is in the minority so id probably keep that to yourself.    The game seriously needs this. The fun factor runs out quickly when you keep playing against players who are more skilled then you.    clearly you havent seen many movies then. Skyfall was no where near terrible.    Its part of the same universe. Daredevil even references the battle of new york.       Are they going to do phases like marvel or just have one massive story arc across a various number of movies?      After Winter Soldier I feel like they would be a perfect fit for another  techno-thriller Iron Man movie. Forget Iron Man 3 ever happened. RDJ has spoken very highly of the russo brothers and it seems like he gets along really well with them. Marvel needs to make this happen.    Have to agree. It was still enjoyable but I found some parts kind of boring.    I know they premiered at StarWars celebration or something like that but has anything been said about a wider release? id love to see ROTS again and in 3D.          I found this gem.   margot robbie is ugly, a bad actress, a home wrecker in real life, and has no charisma to be harley quinn. So many women that have pulled harley quinn off at comic cons, yet hollywood butchered her in this film... Lets see if she acts like an airhead and says funny shit like the real character does... And will smith (which was/is having an affair with margot robbie in real life, since focus) will always be a comedian and suck at being a serious actor... He doesn't even look like deadshot... I guarantee they will both be each other's love interest (again) in this film, since joker is out of the suicide squad. Deadshot should not be a black man... If they made luke cage into a white man, people would cry racism. Then you have ben affleck as batman as the "good" likely protagonist that could never be as good as micheal keaton... The joker doesn't even appear to be the joker... Lets see how charismatic he will be like ledger or nicholson... Killer croc is too small... This is the worst cast i have ever seen for any comic film... And i really wanted to like this film, but the cast killed it... I'm sick and tire of you assholes responding to me when you know i'm going to delete your comment by deleting this one and pasting it again without you shit talking... Let me express myself and leave me alone!!!    I'm pretty sure my IQ just dropped like 50 points reading some of the comments on the Suicide Squad and Batman V Superman trailers. Damn are people stupid.    They certainly would have made use of the joker in the dark knight rises. I believe he was supposed to make a cameo.       I'm not sure what you could do story wise but if they ever did announce anything like that would you guys watch it?         eh I liked amazing spider-man 1 as do a lot of other people.       So why is it I can "stream" 3x07 now? is canada still getting it on Thursdays?   Ant-man all day everyday. Train Wreck looks good tho .      OP did when he said the premise was the same when its not.    Suicide Squad is not based on assault on arkham. Its a new story.    eh. amazing spider-man 1 and thor 2 are good. but ill agree with amazing spider-man 2.          LOL thats so 2007   what the actual fuck.    ive seen that one thats messed up.       Missed out again! The dream is dead.       Not every great movie is released at the cinemas. What are some of your favorites that went straight to vod or dvd?      Do I try and explain the MCU to her or do I let her watch it first and then answer any questions she has? How have you guys delt with people watching their first MCU movie?    Are there any good stories out there of such a thing happening?   Avengers.             David Fincher would be my first choice with Aaron Sorkin writing.       no he teased it. he said "old man logan, read into that what you will and laughed it off"    Wouldn't it be a smart move if Civil War was the first in a line of team up movies outside the avengers? It would kind of make sense to help introduce new superheroes into the MCU like Doctor Strange by having another hero like Spider-Man or Iron Man make a cameo or have a supporting role along side the new hero to introdce them to the MCU?     I just cant stand them they look so ugly. I dont understand how people like them. Please tell me I'm not alone. FYI i'm talking about these http://www.lg.com/us/ultrawide-monitors   Id like to have seen the map the day the batman v superman trailer released. it was arguably the better trailer but suicide squad still looks awesome the trailer just didn't live up to the BvS comic-con trailer.    it was but their still airing the rest of the season.    Chris Evans? you wot m8.       Zodiac - The fact we still don't know who the killer is might have something to do with it so there is still that mystery element there  Sunshine - The adrenaline rush you get at the end when shit starts going down and you dont know if the crews plan will work.         Did you even read my post? thats what this is about. I hope marvel learns from WB and releases their stuff to the public and not try to keep it exclusive like WB did with suicied squad it only hurt their reputation. they should of released it straight away like the batman v superman trailer. Rather than try and keep it comic-con exclusive.       So D23 is coming up and Disney and Marvel are rumored to show the first trailer for Civil War. This past weekend comic-con happened and lots of leaked trailers have been appearing online.   WB intially only released the Batman V Superman trailer but tried to keep suicide squad comic-con exlusive for as long as they could but eventually caved in and released it in HD as well.   I hope Marvel learns from this and realizes that its better to release the trailer officially rather than have people watch it in crappy cam quality since its going to leak anyway especially at d23 where the security isnt as tight as comic-con.   Studios need to stop with this exclusitivity bullshit. Hopefully Marvel learned from this years comic-con and wont repeat the same mistake as WB.    Hmm totalbiscuit is the only good one I know of.       don't like up votes? fine i down voted you biatch.       ah man I remember those rumors during the days while the dark night was in production and then again when rises was in development. I would still like to see this happen.       In the past arrow has usually started filming prior to comic-con this year was different due to Amell finishing up TMNT2. Cause of the late start will there be more breaks once arrow returns so they can catch up?    Any James Bond movie.    deadpool probably isnt for you then. its a certain type of humor targeted at a certain audience. Ryan Reynolds is portryaing deadpool exactly how he is from the comics. Its perfect.    a good fuckin time at the movies   You know the one you keep telling your friends and yourself that youll eventually watch but you never do. yea that one.    dun dun dun......      this was after 5 weeks of filming. of course its not gonna look that great.    So In case you didn't hear AMDs stock is at an all time low. AMD makes the chips inside the PS4,Xbox one and Wii U so It just doesn't affect sony but lets focus on Sony right now. If something happened to AMD what would happen to the ps4? who would manufacture the chips? would sony outsource development to someone else?  http://www.marketwatch.com/story/amds-stock-plunges-to-lowest-level-in-more-than-2-12-years-2015-07-07   They like to clock a feel.       turns you off? what were you turned on by batman v superman? you dirty cheating bastard.          i dont really care tbh i just want to play it.       Its been a few weeks now, anything? Or a crackers not bothering until the PC version gets fixed?   Its sad to think that if Fox and Marvel ever make a deal to share the x-men in the MCU that we wont have Hugh Jackman have a scene with RDJ or Chris Evans or any of the other cast. I dont think anyone can replace him.       How will this affect hollywod and femanism? will it cause a negative reation across the board?    your thinking of Christopher Lee.    OMG! WE KNEW IT! WE FUCKIN KNEW IT! I mean where else were they gonna go for S4? Now I'm curious as to what will bring Oliver out of retirement.    There are mixed feelings on it. Some say it got to artsy for its own good and put being artsy over character development and plot but I disagree I think the show has been great you really need to watch it yourself to decide we cant make up your mind for you.    Hannibal has been imprisoned for three years at the Baltimore State Hospital when a new villain emerges in one Francis Dolarhyde. Jack reaches out to Will to help him track down the brutal serial killer.  Found this on rottentomatoes. Seems to be legit.    actually a lot of people do go for the trailers as dumb as it sounds.       Both films had fans wanting sequels but they never happened, why didn't they?                     eh I love it when the scene changes to the bigger aspect ratio. it looks amazeballs.       interesting my 4790 non k does just fine on the stock cooler. low 30s idle. and around 60-70 while gaming.    he obviously installed it wrong. my i7 4790 is on stock cooler im getting 33c right now with just chrome open and I get about 60-70C on load.    Probably January 2017.   it will still air on BBC one as usual.    kickass torrents.    Life of Pi   And watch as this post gets deleted as well.          Its not.       They used the LOTR music because at the time the score wasn't even composed yet.          why dont you fuck off? eh.    is that the one that sounds like a bird? fuck its annoying.    did you ever think they might have hearing problems? maybe they need it loud so they can hear it.    Maybe they release the first half of the season this year and second half in 2016?   Probably in August at D23. Comic-Con is getting a behind the scenes clip or something.    or they do a different composer for each movie?      From RT" A film remains Certified Fresh unless its Tomatometer falls below 70%. Reserved for the best reviewed films, the Certified Fresh accolade constitutes a seal of approval, synonymous with quality".    I feel like this needs to be said every time a new marvel movie is released. Getting below 70% doesn't mean its a bad movie by any means there are far worse movies out there and besides chances are it could increase to at least over 70% enough to get it certified fresh. Remember the embargo just got lifted so its to early to call the RT number just yet so chill out and go see the movie, enjoy it.       Theyll probably do one more to make it an even 6.    Is there going to be a main thread to discuss all the comic con movie panels this weekend?   na youll get a 680 back lol.    If its coming from Variety its pretty much official.          BRING ME THE PASSANGERS I WANT THEM ALIVE!       Like say at comic con during their panels they just asked the audience straight up what do you guys want in the next avengers movie and actually took down notes and considered them? Or would that movie be a disaster just waiting to happen?      Its a prequel.    Foggy put on weight.    why are you disappointed? the xbox one controller is great for pc games. get off your high horse. stop bitching.    My thoughts exactly. If marvel cant get it right. Put the franchise to rest for a while.    He starts filming guardians of the galaxy 2 early next year. I'm not sure he has time for anything else. He might be able to squeeze in one more movie before the end of this year if hes willing to work without a break.    You might have to go into safe mode and rebuild the database followed by initializing the ps4. https://support.us.playstation.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/5044/~/ps4%3A-safe-mode   For one the ps4 is pretty slim as it is. What I can see happening instead of a slim model coming out is they keep releasing new hardware revisions sort of like the iphone. We've already seen that with the new CUH-1200 model. With an 18% saving in power consumption, A smaller motherboard and memory modules etc.  Well probably get a "4k" compatible ps4 in the future with a bit more horse power. The only thing I can see going wrong is if they make new games only available only on the newer ps4 models. That would just piss people off.    No ones gonna give you hate for liking rise. I love rise also especially the glorious score by hans zimmer.       Did you not see the avengers? clearly they do work when done right.       I mean what have we had so far? a teaser and like a tv spot or two. I know the movie is still a ways out but this is BOND. its like the UK's biggest franchise you think they'd be marketing the shit out of this.       Seems like it would be an obvious thing for Disney to do or will the first trailer be already out by then? I think the first trailer for winter soldier came out in October.    Youtube peasant doesn't know who linus is. what is this madness.    Break in and put a firepole then leave. I wonder if they'll notice...   the Invisible titan z   Its a trap. we're all going to see flashing lights now.       Its so cute!    You didn't even try and google did you?   Wtf thats creepy.       Sauce?   Batman's suit is confirmed to use Kryptonite. Learn to keep up with news.       Like how hot can they be for extended periods of time before it starts effecting their life span?   That's quite the spoiler there be warned. Your ruining a great surprise.    Its not a scam its run by EA. Something must have gone wrong on their end. you should have waited for the key.    Find out on the next episode of dragonballz!   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vawwy2eu5sA   Anyone else really looking forward to this game?    speak for yourself. A lot of us like diablo 3.    +1 for Rocket League! looks like a great multiplayer game.       cant you get both? sleeping dogs should be pretty cheap now.      no ones going to wait 6 months to year to play it on PC.   Wow your a douche bag.    She was the one who passed on Black Panther. Marvel didn't pass on her.    https://www.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/3bxduw/why_was_riama_along_with_a_number_of_other_large/   I get it. it sucks what happened to Victoria but come on. if r/PS4 goes dark what do we do then?   I cant take these posts seriously anymore. So cringey.    Just an entry level IT service technician job.    So I'm a recent graduate student and this is my first time job hunting so maybe I just suck at finding jobs but I'm having trouble finding entry level IT jobs. I've applied to about 12 jobs so far been declined from one. I check trademe and seek a few hours a day. Any other places I can look at and any tips for looking for IT jobs?      I think your partly right. I think they will assemble to take out a bigger threat Baron Zemo? But it will be the last time we see Stark and Rogers team up until Infinity War. I think when Stark finds out Bucky killed his parents Stark wont be able to forgive Rogers for keeping that from him. They will put a side their differences in Civil War for the greater good but once the dust settles in Civil War stark and rogers will part ways until Thanos arrives.    so what if hes on FB a lot as long as he gets the job done who cares.       How many episodes would you want and what news stories would you want to see the show tackle?  	200
 Audio seems to be a pretty popular format for books! What made you want to switch?   For example, I've gone from preferring to read in silence to enjoying reading the most when I have some background music or noise playing.      If you like Star Wars, you gotta read the thrawn trilogy. The story is easy to get sucked into, and in my opinion, Grand Admiral Thrawn is sooo much better and more terrifying of a villain than the emperor or lord vader.   When hot coffee or tea is at the perfect temperature that lets you sip your drink without burning your tongue.   When you think "oh, man..." instead of "oh, man!" when you seem him/her.   Do not trust a person who buys unfrosted poptarts.      People who blame waiters for bad food. I can understand a situation like a request not being written down, but why blame the waiter if your food doesn't taste good or is undercooked, overcooked, etc.?   Girls with boyish haircuts. The last girl I dated had bleach blonde hair cut to angsty-teenage-boy, and goddamn, she made me harder than a tank made of wolverine's bones.   I have some friends who are going into the military but who don't know much or anything about the conflicts they could be involved in. To me, that type of ignorance can be incredibly dangerous.   Wow, your response definitely brings an important perspective to the conversation. If the following is too personal to answer, please feel free to not respond: what is it like having people look down at you for following orders that you couldn't break? It's easy enough to say what is the right or wrong thing to do when you're thousands of miles away from the conflict, but I cannot imagine what it's like having to face those delimas during a battle situation.   I'm talking about veterans of wars that have taken place within the past twenty years or so; some examples of wars I'm talking about are the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.   	13

    First off, my brothers and I were/are huge fans of your show!  Really awesome that you're still doing stuff with acting!  My question: What are you some "odd" hobbies you have?   Speaking of which, I've actually had a neat idea for #2 recently lol   Oh man, I remember watching that finale when it appeared.  I still to this day consider it to be one of the absolute best season finales I've ever seen.  It has served as inspiration to me on many levels in what I design.  That said, I was disappointed with how they handled it after.  I was hoping they would really play up the fact that he was this brilliant doctor in a psychiatric hospital more, but then they ended up using it for only a couple of episodes.   ### Keybase proof  I hereby claim:    * I am [gemisis](https://www.reddit.com/user/gemisis) on reddit.   * I am [gemisis](https://keybase.io/gemisis) on keybase.   * I have a public key whose fingerprint is 27E7 0F84 1A4B 49B7 BFCF  FE16 92BB 6EBE 1E4E 1FAA  To claim this, I am signing this object:       {         "body": {             "key": {                 "fingerprint": "27e70f841a4b49b7bfcffe1692bb6ebe1e4e1faa",                 "host": "keybase.io",                 "key_id": "92bb6ebe1e4e1faa",                 "kid": "0101c0be6badecc1baa56a3ac7f2bb95320c86d784452e03d9f3258bfaa4250b8a4f0a",                 "uid": "668aa3cc2b04111a837abe0448681119",                 "username": "gemisis"             },             "service": {                 "name": "reddit",                 "username": "gemisis"             },             "type": "web_service_binding",             "version": 1         },         "ctime": 1432678608,         "expire_in": 157680000,         "prev": "d1bd4f4698e6062d9d98a6149f69164d2d20836c1581ca3b06e7bf1337e79e6b",         "seqno": 3,         "tag": "signature"     }  with the key from above, yielding:       -----BEGIN PGP MESSAGE-----     Version: Keybase OpenPGP v2.0.8     Comment: https://keybase.io/crypto          yMIHAnicdVJdSBVBGL1qhhpWRARWYmxEmNfa2Z2dnbVAKwqiHwrJXqrLzO7sdbW7     17t7NU36oZ4qEFOiP4jAoCBJSftVwaQUNDSITI2y7L6IoBVkpIbNir3VvAzf+c45     fPOdeZGa4EuJ2xYbKPhSlRQf1/NcLfUdNL6+rhRo2KgQciqFYjZ3mZYdZE6JY9lR     IUeQVKaKJoaAQAo1qlJTN00GkCZRihhlgEEGTEIEv1AYdj0Ft6HEZRutMMd4EbAM     jv6DXzzXEIEIdJEyRInBdB1QQhREZKKrJpdoiiyJOkaGiiFUJCbKhmbKkoIp94CS     IlJMoCl6dqVzdghhQmRdl6gIAQAEyyqhTIQQI8xrzSO6zLFJiHF2kIUs13KFk36B     g2WWzrwNzDcdZhhW9L+CaEWJhxxnNDCvDVDLNvj2uKSMOa4VtoUcwJl61PLEAMoS     UjESsV9g5SWWwwKWx1BUhEV+/EKJw8q4pQGoAU2INMyQiCRDMzRMEICaiTSAoCEZ     kohlpAMFA53IVESM5wJkmWel8UUK3msidljIkfmYJMgtXStok2ipw4STHe2HF/ji     UnwLE+O9/H0pyUv//gpwKsnX8rg1LdY53DrUVUdvbyh9kr4pcuCjVP9gc7abse7E     hpGmsymNT5Ord645mjHTMOqbCuXW1p971/wmlvpy+tnp6vKpO5l929M/JFbntj1c     sWN690S/ciWY4C88Erc4Sy8IDFxfeK25LpQFq5Sm1R1t9cvy8p1r9zPv3bi4rmeL     fbUP/x5aG70x8m1XZHJkbHD4U3u6XbT3Z/Ytd3fb2cnOlUrW9c/xrevvFvVOzpCG     5l/LA7WXayr2N0bW9+avqp9UxvLk7K3NZyLdE4uK+o61oCVjr668Tc3s6r4wnm+e     75wtOFG3L+PSj/7kmtjOwanxvEOj30Pvwx2t+s3c2T09Ztqjhj+LgS6R     =sF65     -----END PGP MESSAGE-----  Finally, I am proving my reddit account by posting it in /r/KeybaseProofs    And then there's this lol (Though OPs is still awseome)  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24QZA0-pMLI   See, this gives me hope that some of us small-timers will be able to get one still :) Here's to hoping!   Can anyone confirm that they received an email from valve after registering? Kinda curious as it sounds like this is about developers who already had access in some way, not the ones who signed up on their page.    Whoops, sorry about the delay!  So, when I say "cleanup" I mean delete any pointers you've created essentially in this particular case.  So for example, for your array of pointers for npcs you need to free each one that you've created, in order to ensure that they don't keep hogging the memory you gave them.   This, so much this. I used to install Firefox to use instead of IE and my family would blame it for slowing down the computer when it wasn't even running (and  had ample hard drive space yes).  If anything went wrong with any tech I was at fault, but they wouldn't listen to my suggestions for things. As an aspiring programmer and maker at the time, it was a major blow to my confidence with tech looking back on it now.  It wasn't until I was halfway through my degrees in computer engineering and computer science at college and had an internship that my parents FINALLY started trusting me around their computers. Now that I have a full time job, they're slowly starting to ask me for advice too.   TLDR; parents didn't trust me with technology until I got a career in the field even though I'd done fine with it for years.   (*game::npcs[game::total]).setPos(x,y); is a bit silly, I would just use game::npcs[game::total]-setPos(x,y);, but yeah, that'll work technically.  Uhh, basically you need to cleanup any resources associated with that enemy (textures, etc.)   Look into shared pointers. They have a limited garbage collection system that might prove useful when starting if you are worried about memory leaks and such.   The problem is that pointers are one of the big reasons that C++ is used as you gain big speed and performance gains. If you aren't using them, you may want to look into other languages to make your life easier.    Sorry about the delay, just got home from work.  See my response above for a fix :)  	13
       There's nothing about being racist, or prejudiced, or being paid half to do the same work with the same amount of qualifications, in there either. So....   I'm with you on this. We just don't take our little one out until she learned such behavior was unacceptable. She learned fairly quickly.       This. When people ask questions regarding moral decline and an increasingly sexualized people. #progress   Any Irishman on here? Please read this in said thick accent.   Very true. But I think he isn't unique in this.       Thanks for the link, I'll take a look.    On your last sentence, walk me through your reasoning on that? Why do you think so or not...   "assuming life is a one in a trillion". This is the key assumption right?   Ah, but within theistic philosophy, you know there are those who subscribe to a hierarchy of 'other' entities (think Greek, Romans and Teutons).   lol. That's an interesting thought. So it's not infinite then, you just can't get out of it? check.   How is the universe infinite? Can you cite a source I can look at?   Guys, i'm neither for or against any side of the argument (at least not within the context of this debate). What I want is your conclusions on the question and the reasoning that led to it.  Thanks to all who have replied.   In keeping with objective facts: how is the universe 'infinite'? Where is the proof of this?    So, this Bernie Sanders guy, are we going to vote him in or what?  What is the plan? What about congress?   I have nothing against Sanders (i'm actually pretty much sold on him except I will do my homework/research before a final decision), but I am not going to invest my psychic strength in the presidential election just to watch congress get Jerrymandered to death.      And how is your belief in aliens not the same as those held by many theists? How do you define 'alien' and why do we expect them to be made up of the same substance as our universe (namely, matter)?   I see your point. And also appreciate your noting the value in the idea. I think it will only be a matter of time before someone with a more cost effective mechanism figures out an 'affordable' solution.            Please seek professional help. This is no different from suffering major physical trauma. You need professional treatment/therapy to heal properly.    Never finding your size in the clearance isle. I mean on stuff you'd actually want to buy.   I find it ironic that our greatest device as a species is something designed for mass destruction. Hats off humanity, way to go!   If your plan is to 'save' money, then you don't have a plan. Please read and comprehend the ops experience, which is very similar to your proposal.   Brilliant. And very wise.   You start off by calling my comment retarded, then begin to elaborate on asset allocation. .. Hmm.   This is very true. It brings go mind, the advice Christ gave to the one rich fellow: part with your riches. Most people think this was meant for everyone. But it is only meant for a very specific type of person who, as you alluded to, the wealth would effectively paralyze rather than help.  Some people will use the wealth in a productive, furthering way. For others, it will rob them of the fire to be successful and do something with their lives.   Hear, hear!   "Sanders would ruin the country"... Something there doesn't sound right. Isn't it already in ruins when minimum wage is unable to ... Nah, never mind. It's Friday and the weather is beautiful. I'm not going to let anyone take that away from me! You hear me? You selfish greedy ones, you are not going to take that away from me!   You are either making money, or spending it. Nothing stands still... You will only end up flat broke when you fail to plan.    I think this advice, while well intended, is the wrong one. Money is as water, it is designed to move and not stay put. It is just in trying to 'put away' money (ie. holding water in your hands) that it will slowly trickle away and eventually flow elsewhere completely. Dream a dream and go after it. There is nothing more potent than having a goal of what to do with the money. The absence of this is the presence of exactly what the author enumerated.    How much time have you dedicated outside your own mind and thinking on the matter?  Maybe you can start here and look for some of the publications referenced in the video.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSF82AwSDiU      TL;DR: What we have is a modern-day case of the emperors new clothes. So many compromises to the truth have been made and careers advanced by hiding or glossing over gender-integration issues in the military. It will take concerted opposition from a range of politicians who have the courage to look beyond the latest headline in the New York Times or on CNN.  edit: paraphrased article.   What's a terrible idea?   Isn't this a little too convenient? Doesn't it give freedom to so many things that are logically objectionable?   One person may enjoy dog fights, another the torturing animals or other human beings. Yet others rape, murder, etc.  No, enjoyment shouldn't even be a factor.        I'm sorry that I don't think, and you probably agree, that just because x number of people 'enjoy' something and find it 'entertaining' is any measure of it not being a waste of time and energy. The right question to ask is: to what end? What, of value, comes out of this adventure?   What do you do? No seriously?   Let me ask you then to give me an example, just one, of something that you consider 'deep'?    I wouldn't have to. Since we are doing the same thing, we will logically end with the same results.    Let's be realistic, no one is going to convince anyone of anything they weren't already inclined to believe. My comment was actually meant more for people like yourself... People who actually pause to think. And no, i do not have any constructive alternatives since I am just as lost as everyone else. But in pointing out this fact, maybe more people will realize, then we can all gather and figure out what to do instead.  	45
    How the fuck do I even do that? The trace back error I'm getting: http://imgur.com/PxFJZpu I don't get it. This is so easy in Maya.  So I'm in the environment variables, I've found RMANTREE all that, now what do I do?             How do I change it to PRman 20? I downloaded prman 20 but that did not change anything.    Yes I have PRman itself.      What does that mean?      What price range are we looking at for this plugin mate?      LONG LIVE THE TROLL MILITIA!         I never had any intentions of bringing Aurora to war. I was only suggesting plans of action since our close allies, the FSR, have decided to occupy Orion. Please, I'm not a violent individual. I only wish to live with my friends in Aurora, my political goals or beliefs for Aurora should have nothing to do with my citizenship.    Fuck it, done. Like I  said, third time posting here, and why? Why do I keep on going through this shit? So here I am, fucking rock bottom. Let's look at what's happened with me, shall we? I'm running hurdles. I think I'm pretty damn good. It was my very first year, never even took interest into sports until then. I get 4th or 3rd place. I was running with the big boys too. I thought my family would be proud, but fuck no. Dad never went to my meets, for he is in the Navy. Can it get worse? With my family? Of course. Everyone compares me to my cousin. Everyone say's she's a genius in school, yet I'm the one who leads her and tutor her. I'm even compared to her in my favorite sport: Hurdles. I'm tired of the comparison. One day, I decided I loved movies and took up a hobby known as Visual Effects. With help from people like Gleb Alexandrov, I created this: http://imgur.com/VhhuCFd I thought my family would be so proud, but rather everyone justs says, "That's cool and all, but did you see what your cousin did in her soccer game/hurdles?" Then there's tonight, fucking tonight. I'm currently in High School, and I'm living with my divorced mom and my sister. My family members are SJWs , so I can't talk rude to my sister despite her talking rude to me. Anyways, we are all watching tv, and being the shit service AT T Uverse is, it stops working. I offer to fix it, but I fail. I tell my family that it's just AT T being shitty. And they fucking say,"Oh stop it, AT T is cheaper. Your just being ungrateful. Besides, you only have yourself to be mad it, you thought you could program it." Program it? Are we in a fucking 4chan cringe thread? How do you program a tv? I know OpenGL and Pixar's Renderman, not whatever shitty code language AT T uses. And then my family complains that I'm always grumpy. What the fuck do I even do at this point? This has gone on for years and years and years, we have shitloads of pills everywhere. What am I to do?   yes   Info: Refugee from the Kairenreich. Member of New Leningrad and Tel-Aviv.   Ive been on a couple times before. And in those couple times, the kaisenreich has fucking imploded on itself   That's why I'm traveling to CKR. I'm a mercenarie with shit loads of materials for slimeblock tanks and aircraft.   So with this, I can join minecraft Classic servers again?   I think this one will do. http://imgur.com/PF3t9NZ      Alright first we need a picture of a grill and a popular tumblr account   So, we find a picture of a girl, and call her Melissa.

Current medications: Zoloft   But I don't want the Hdri map showing up in the final render.  I only want the lighting.What do I do?   Is RIS compatible with standard maya hypershade nodes?   How the hell do you even bake lighting in Renderman. The online docs are from 2008. How do I bake lighting in from the Envlight onto my character? Please help fellow gentle sirs of r/cg.      Just wondering. I've seen slimeblock bombers only used on 4craft. I've just taken an incredible interest in aviation, both in game and in real life.      I've got my AllPurposeMaterial and everything. So where do I go now? What do I need to do? What nodes do I connect and how do I connect said nodes?   So I paint ptex in mudbox, send that over to maya. Add renderman attributes which include ptex supoort and subdivision scheme. i then go into slim, create an allpurpose material, and attack a ptex color node. I go back into maya, select my object, go into slim, right click the allpurpose material, hit assign as surface. go back into maya, choose renderman ris, hit render, and nothing but black?   what should I do? Also lets make this a general renderman questions thread while we are at it.   What the hell went through your mind when posting this? It's not even funny. Just two cucklords giving each other genuine advice.   Aside from the game coming out itself.   Also, with source, I'm using Blender cycles to render scenes and then baking their textures so that the game looks photorealistic. Is this efficient if I want good graphics?    But again, I need a place to download steam pre steam pipe, crowbar, mdlcompiler, and studiomdl don't work.        	50
 The theatrical cut, the director's cut, the final cut, the workprint, and the broadcast version.   Sure, but I think we can tell empirically now that whenever Clemson is projected to win the ACC, Florida State will go on to win the national championship.     ESPN has ranked the SEC teams with the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 5th, 6th, 7th, 11th, 12th, 13th, 18th, 19th, and 20th hardest SOS.   It might already be mathematically impossible for less than 6 SEC teams to be in the top 15 at any given time.    You could also look at it as one missed catch (NCState) and one bad quarter of play by EJ Manuel (UF) away from being 13-0 going into bowl season. We had one of the five best defenses in the nation and one of the 10-15 best offenses. Also we finished 8th in the final coaches poll. We were definitely in that range.    Last time Clemson was predicted to win the ACC? 2013.   Probably not though. Assuming that 8-4 means splitting Notre Dame and South Carolina, it puts you at 5-3 in conference play. It's very likely that at least one of FSU   Louisville go 6-2 or better in conference. I think 9-3 is the low end of the Atlantic champion, but 10-2 is most likely.   I'm going to disagree with you on Jimbo - if he leaves it would be for the NFL I imagine, so he certainly *could* do a Saban, but it's far more likely he just stays at FSU permanently.   - Both had two national championships     - T-5 ranked seasons: Bowden 15, Paterno 13   - T-10 ranked seasons: Bowden 18, Paterno 20   - Ranked Seasons: Bowden 28, Paterno 35 - Total Wins: Bowden 389, Paterno 409   I'm ignoring conference titles because Joe Pa's "prime" was mostly while they were still an independent school      Green. Very green.   Can I come with? This was not the wild ride I signed up for.    You spelled his name wrong.    We'd be lucky to finish the season in the T10, because right now we're just not a T10 team. But lucky to be ranked is ridiculous. Everett Golson is plenty good enough to man the helm for a ranked team, we have the 2nd best RB in the ACC and THREE five star WR's. We also return 7 starters on defense.    Beyond that, our schedule is extremely weak this year. USF/Texas State/Wake/Syracuse/Chattanooga are five wins on lock. We'll be heavily favored over @BC, Miami, and NC State. So even if we only win one of @GT, @Clemson and @UF there's still a good chance this team goes 10-2.    Disagree, Christian Ponder's junior year was much better than any year EJ Manuel had and he was looking like a very real NFL prospect on talent alone before he got injured and lost a lot of shoulder strength.    There isn't, dude mispoke.    I think Auburn is going to get the disappointment train rolling early and lose to Louisville   It's actually a good bit less than that because any time he plays another texas team he's earning non-state taxed income, and anytime he plays in Tennessee or Florida (@Heat, @Memphis or @Magic) he's earning income that doesn't give rise to a state income tax.  Also state income taxes are deductible on his fed return so 40% of the amount he pays in state income taxes is going right back into his pocket as a federal deduction.  Also taking into account agent fees and other deductible expenses his actual taxable income is going to be much lower than that anyways.  Source: Tax Accountant   Thank goodness SheridanHoops has probably the least reputable of any major twitter leak guy.    Johnson is our only returning starter. Cameron irving was our starting center, because four games into the season Hoefield was getting so dominated at the line that he lost his starting job; so technically we're returning his starts but it's worthless as he is likely not going to get his starting job back again this year. Tre Jackson, Bobby Hart and Josue Matias were all drafted as well.  As far as the rest of our O-line goes, we had two JUCO tranfers that redshirted last year but have supposedly looked very good in the spring game (Chad Mavety and Kareem Are), then redshirt sophomore Wilson Bell will take right guard, leaving us with only the center position to fill. We've got talent and our O-line should theoretically not look terrible, but we're extremely green with four players having no starts to their name.   We lost a few important players (Jernigan, Joyner), but we returned 17 starters, 4/5 of our O-line, a Heisman QB, two projected draftee receivers, the best kicker in the nation, three projected 1st or 2nd round picks in the secondary, and two more projected first-third round picks on our D-Line. it was definitely one of the most stacked talentwise teams of the last couple of years, so... no tOSU isn't returning more talent than we did.    No, we lost four starters and have the 2nd fewest returning starts of any O-line in the country.   Yep. Last year they went 6-3 before FSU and 0-3 afterwords.  in 2013 they went 7-0 before FSU and 2-2 afterwords.     Ehh, it's also unfair to equivocate all top programs though.  For all it's problems, FSU forcing players out is not one of them, Alabama and Ohio State have had 16 and 14 more players sign with them over the last four years respectively, because Jimbo just doesn't really employ that tactic.    TBF this pretty much described FSU to a tee last year.   Having every team gunning for your back, and dealing with injuries/regression/new coordinators really does make repeating extraordinarily hard.    Davis' offense was considered extremely raw in college and was the biggest question mark he had going into the draft.    Nah. Kevin Love got the Wolves Wiggins with one year left on his contract. Magic got Vuc, Aflallo, and the #12 pick. Deron Williams got the Jazz #3 pick Derrick Favors and  another #3 pick after that. There's still plenty of value with 1 year left.    Also the summer after that.   Because it probably wasn't rigged    Yeeeah, this would be a legal breach of contract with a remedy in a federal court, lol they wouldn't have to strike to enforce their own CBA.   Oladipo would be our starting SG, like he was last year.    This is wrong. Moses did it in 1983.  http://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/198305290LAL.html  Cowens did it 3 times in the same finals series: http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/c/cowenda01/gamelog/1974/      He's class of 2017 though, so probably 3 years minimum away from making a contribution. Still a nice grab nonetheless.    Another Runner Up: http://cdn.bleacherreport.net/social_assets/stiff%20arm.gif    If you go back in time to 7 minutes left in the third quarter and replay that game without any of FSU's ridiculous turnovers, my guess is FSU would have like a 25% chance of winning that game.  Of course, based on the reports about how Oregon was looking to strip the ball because they noticed FSU players carried it loose, I'm thinking you just chalk that TO margin to random chance, so the answer is "very likely not"      No, because no team would ever play their two best players 24 minutes or less.    58-11 in 5 years as head coach, 39-3 last three seasons, 27-1 last two seasons, one year removed from national championship, two major bowl wins, 4 T5 recruiting classes the last five years? 17th sounds about right.       *cough*Magic*cough*   Would it? They had Kevin Love those 41 games.    It's another way of saying "the 12 highest regular season teams of all time by MOV", of which the Warriors are comfortably in that pack.    Nope, Thunder were the highest team to miss the cutoff (9.21)   12 Teams in NBA history have eclipsed a regular season point differential of 9.24  -Ten of them have won the NBA championship.    -One of them (Kareem's 1972 Bucks, 4th all time in regular season point differential) lost to another team on the list (Lakers, 1st all time in regular season point differential).    -The other is this year's Golden State Warriors (8th all-time in regular season)     58-11 in 5 years as head coach, 39-3 last three seasons, 27-1 last two seasons, one year removed from national championship, two major bowl wins, 4 T5 recruiting classes the last five years? Yep, 19th sounds about right.    Dude, you finished the regular season 6-6 this past year, and that was your first non-losing regular season this decade. You haven't had an 8 win season since 2007, and have gone 40-47 over that timespan. And assessing yourself as #35 is totally asinine considering you weren't even one of the 13 schools receiving votes in the AP poll at the end of the year.    It's really unfair to expect anyone to believe Tennessee is "back" in any form until you actually get wins on the field.    I'm looking to get a good used first motorcycle that is pretty functional/easy to use around the city; but I plan on taking it on 150-300 rides maybe 2-3 times a month, and would eventually like to take it on a couple 400+ mile multi-day journeys.   I've heard a lot of great things about the Kawasaki KLR 650, and I'm wondering if there were any other bikes that were recommended for the occasional long trip.    I'm looking to buy my first motorcycle jacket (and my first motorcycle soon), and one thing I've noticed about jackets is that they end right at the waistline. I'm 6'2 with the torso of somebody who is about 6'4, and skinny enough that most standard "large" sizes are going to fit ridiculously on me. I'm wondering if there are any jackets out there that have naturally longer torsos (or options for longer torsos) so at the very least it hits my belt standing upright.   1. You're dramatically underrating our quarterbacks. Who cares what Maguire ran in HS? That was four years ago, and he's had four years to learn Jimbo's *incredibly* complex offense since then.   2. You act like Maguire played like a scrub against Clemson. He had a bad interception sure, but he also looked incredibly poised at times in the third quarter, and it was against the #1 defense in the nation, and he had not taken ANY snaps with the 1st team up to that point because Winston's suspension was announced the day before the game. Context is incredibly important with that one performance.  3.  Seriously though, Jimbo's offense is an incredibly complex pro style offense, and it has taken more talented QB's than Golston several years to pick it up. Even if he is (and he might be) a better quarterback in a vacuum than everyone we have on our roster, that doesn't mean he's going to play better than guys like Maguire who have had tons of time to get comfortable with the route trees and the recievers.   4.  Our Next big recruit, Malik Henry, is about to be a senior in HS and there is very little chance he starts as a true freshman for the aforementioned reasons. We need a starting QB for the next two years, and none of the current QB's on our roster are seniors. So even if Golson did turn out to be the best option, unless he is dramatically better I don't think it's wise for our long-term development as a team looking at 2016 to start a guy with one year of eligibility left.  So, stop acting so indignant about FSU fans throwing away some gift from heaven bestowed upon them. There are plenty of reasons for FSU fans to be wary of this transfer.    Yikes... Talking about modern era coaches (i.e. since inception of AP poll in 1936) I would put it in a rough order of something like this, with the top four all definitely in the top 5.    Bear Bryant   Joe Pa   Bobby Bowden   Tom Osborne   Woody Hayes    Barry Switzer   Nick Saban   Bud Wilkinson   Darrell Royal   Frank Leahy   Urban Meyer   John McCay   Ara Parseghian     I think you could argue for Hayes/Switzer in the five spot right now, with Saban easily beating out those two if he continues to finish in the top-10 for a couple more years and/or wins another chip.   In coaching history haha. I definitely would say BB is T-5 all-time.   Very likely never. Sorry. Five championships is pretty ridiculous.    The all-time numbers are not incorrect, they add back wins vacated by the NCAA.   Incredibly well for freshman, which is almost impossible to do given how complex Jimbo's route trees are. WR's simply do not thrive as freshman here.    I mean, you could also say that their record is meaningless considering they played different schedules every year too. They're still valid accomplishments that go on a school's resume.   Nah, we have the #2 receiver from this past years class, and the #3 and #5 WR from the 2014 class who both played incredibly well as freshman.   ||||| :--|:--:|:--:|--:   Stat |**Florida** | **Florida State** | **Miami**   All-time Wins rank | **22nd** | 70th | 49th   All-time Win% rank | 16th | **10th** | 15th   National Champs | 3 | 3 | **5**   Heisman Winners | **3** | **3** | 2   Conference Champs | 8 | **18** | 9   All Americans | 31 | **39** | 35     Bowl Games | 41 | **43** | 37   Bowl Wins | 21 | **26** | 18   Weeks Ranked in AP | **555** | 523 | 460  **Why They're the Bes**t:    **Florida**: Will always be "the" program in the state of Florida. Bigger boosters, more resources,  more fans, SEC affiliation. If a coach had his pick of the three programs, it would just about always be UF, as they're simply the more prestigious job.   **Florida State**: FSU has one of the 5ish "Titans" of coaching in college football history. They're 3 more made bowls away from breaking Nebraska's record for consecutive bowl appearances (currently at 33, the record is 35). From 1987-2000 they finished the season ranked in the top-5 FOURTEEN consecutive times, no other school in history has ever done it more than seven. In fact, in the last 30 years no school has won more games than Florida State's 300, with Nebraska (289) in 2nd and tOSU (286) in 3rd.   **Miami**: You like Natty's? Every other accomplishment in college football is varying degrees of "nice" but championships are the goal, and Miami has five of them. Only Alabama has more in the last 50 years.    That's exactly what I was looking for. Thank you!   I've started saving with the intermediate-term goal of buying an apartment or flat in my city. I believe I can find one I will like for about $120,000. I'm trying to figure out how much I need in total to actually buy the apartment including *all* costs of acquiring the property. I know saving up 20% to avoid PMI is smart. Otherwise I have no idea what the other miscellaneous costs will be.   Probably fair to point out that with vacated wins added back it's:   1. Nebraska 389    2. Ohio State 378   3. Florida State 377   4. Oklahoma 365    Orange bowl is actually one of the semi-finals this year, but a major bowl for sure.   **Clemson v. FSU**. It would be easy to say that Clemson would run away with this, as they did afterall only lose to FSU last time with their (now Heisman winning) starting quarterback out of commission. The game starts, and Clemson takes off, moving the ball around the field at will. An early interception by Francois turns into a short touchdown drive for Clemson, and they are starting to pull away heavy at the end of the first half 35-14. The second half begins, and Kermit Whitfield works his National Championship magic, returning the ball for a touchdown. 35-21. Clemson starts to look a little stifled, and FSU proves capable of burning the clock on the run, though a costly lost fumble prevents them from making up any ground for the rest of the third quarter. Clemson starts the 4th quarter with a field goal. To begin to pull away again 38-21. FSU responds quickly with a downfield 50 yarder to Rudolph putting them immediately in scoring position again. Another completed pass over the middle to Rudolph, and Jacques Patrick there to punch it in from the 3 yard line, FSU scores 38-28. Clemson gets the ball back, and Watson is sacked for a loss. Next play, quick screen to Germone Hopper, but the pass is low and it bounces off his arms directly into the hands of Jalen Ramsey. FSU Ball. At the 15. Two run plays later its 3rd and 1 at the 6. Cook runs it in for the TD. 38-35 Clemson still leading. Clemson gets the ball back again, 3:17 left on the clock. Incomplete pass. Incomplete pass. Third and 10 and FSU is out of timeouts. Watson throws to Scott for 8 yards. Swinney plays conservative and punts it. This proves to be a bad idea, as Bobo Wilson takes it back 20+ yards to the Clemson 23 yard line. Two minute warning. Francois pass incomplete to Rudolph, almost picked off. Clemson brings the Blitz on 2nd and Francois dumps it off to Cook for a gain of five. Third down Cook goes right up the middle. To get the first at the 11 yard line. 35 seconds left. Francois lobs it to Ermon Lane in the corner. Touchdown FSU 42-38. Clemson kick return gets them out to the 45 yard line, but Watsons Hail Mary bounces off a group of defenders and wide receivers bunched together as time expires. And thats how FSU beats Clemson to win the National Championship.    The 2015 season starts off with a bang. The nation forgets that Bobby Petrino is a really good coach, and receiving votes Louisville upsets #10 Auburn vaulting them to about 15th (and Auburn to 17th), many pollsters think the surprisingly potent offense makes them the favorite to win the ACC after their close win over an elite SEC team, but the momentum doesnt last long. Clemson dominated two cupcakes early, but nobody really knows anything about their team yet, except that Deshaun Watson is healthy. Clemson goes into Louisville at home and puts on a remarkable display of offensive firepower, winning 45-24. This includes a 330yard/3td/80 rushing yd game by Deshaun Watson who is now front and center of the Heisman race. Two and a half weeks later they trample a #16 ranked Notre Dame team that was considered formidable with a solid win over Texas and a close loss to Georgia Tech. Another 350yd/2td performance by Deshaun who is leading the nation in passer rating, and Clemson has climbed comfortably into 9th place looking very much like a playoff contender four games into the season.   On the other side of the ACC, Georgia Tech looks like a fully realized triple option team. Justin Thomas has the engine humming smoothly and so far theyve beaten two cupcake teams, eeked out a close win against formerly #12 Notre Dame thanks to a 4th quarter interception, and mauled Duke and UNC for 380+ rushing yards a piece.   When Georgia Tech and Clemson meet, a large minority of media personalities think this could a preview of the ACC championship, and maybe even a playoff spot preview, with the two teams already a combined 9-0 and ranked in the top 12. The teams start off trading blows  touchdown after touchdown  each quarterback looking unstoppable in their respective system. Thanks to some great halftime adjustments by Venables, they manage to hold GT scoreless for three consecutive possessions in the 3rd/4th quarter which is enough to pull away for a 38-31 win.  Clemson now has three wins against ranked teams 5 games into the season. They cruise through a couple lesser opponents, Boston College and Miami, climb up to #6 in the polls at 7-0, and are feeling on top of the world before traveling to NC State for a heartbreakingly pyrrhic 42-10 victory. But first rewind a bit.   Florida state starts the reason ranked 8th, and nobody is exactly sure why. Five of their six best players left early for the draft or graduated, their offensive line has a total of EIGHT career starts between all five of them, and true freshman Deandre Francois was named the starter 10 days before their opener, much to the surprise of the entire fan base. They start the season creaming two fluff teams, and leave their fans with cautious optimism after a 34-21 win over Boston College. After two big wins over two more easy conference rivals Wake Forest and a decrepit Miami (Kaaya ends the day with four interceptions) a couple things become clear: FSU has an *elite* trio of running backs carrying the team, Francois is not a game manager but a gunslinger who is being consistently bailed for his rookie mistakes by an elite receiving corps of Rudolph/Lane/Wilson/Harrison/Campbell, and their secondary might also be one of the best in the nation. Of course, the narrative is not a pretty one, with the vast majority of CFB fans assuming they are way overrated and havent played anybody and living on reputation alone. Even when #7 Florida State (they moved up one spot thanks to USC falling flat on its ass) beats #17 Louisville 35-24 to go 6-0 they are given no love, as Louisville is now viewed as a pretender with a fluke win over Auburn.     Georgia Tech, now two weeks removed from their loss to Clemson and hungry for blood, frustrates their way to a 35-34 home victory over Florida State, with an 80 yard drive (capped off by a 20 yard TD pass from Thomas) in the final four minutes of the game. FSU drops to #13 and hope looks to be lost for the season.   Clemson goes into NC State and absolutely dominates, but late in the 3rd quarter on a fateful 3rd and short, Watson escapes out of a collapsing pocket to run for the first down, and doesnt get back up. He is pulled from the game while the collective Clemson fan base holds their breath for the news. The next day it is announced Watson has sprained his ankle and will be out for three weeks.   12th ranked Florida State goes into #3 Clemsons Memorial Stadium and Deandre Francois has the game of his life. With two 60+ yard bombs down the field, and the running back trio averaging 6.6ypc, Clemson simply doesnt have the offense without Deshaun Watson on the field, and the Tigers fall 41-31 to the Noles. In spite of this, the CFB playoff committee controversially ranks Clemson #8 and FSU #9, citing their starting quarterbacks absence as a mitigating factor. But the travesty sets in for Clemson fans, knowing that both schools now have one conference game loss and Florida State holds the tiebreaker. With an easy win over NC State, FSU Miraculously locks in its 4th ACC title game in a row. Georgia Tech finishes the season with a second very close win against Virginia Tech and a trampling of Miami to go 10-1.   Over in the SEC, there has been a dramatic shift of power. Floridas line looks atrocious at first but comes together against their first real test, at Missouri. Will Grier is thriving in McElwains offensive scheme and is getting Heisman murmurs from their fanbase. After he leads the gators in a march down the field for two fourth quarter scores and pull out a 28-24 victory over LSU, ESPN adopts the nickname for him big game Grier. In a 2014 Noles fashion they pull out close wins over Missouri, Tennessee at home, at LSU and against Georgia. They were briefly ranked #2 going 9-0 before the Ole ball coach gives them their first loss of the season. South Carolina, by the way, has rebounded miraculously from last season, and from an early loss the Georgia, sweeping through A M, LSU, and the rest of its conference schedule. With a win over the Gators and their pre-Clemson cupcake, the Gamecocks are also 10-1. Georgia proves to the nation just how good a team can be behind their running back, as Nick Chubb has been front and center in the Heisman race all year with an insane 1800 yards through 11 games, and the only loss on the Bulldogs schedule against UF. On the other side of the conference, cannibalism abound in Alabamas down year, as Auburn, Bama, and LSU all finish 9-3, capped off with an exciting Auburn win over Bama in the Iron bowl. Ole Miss, A M, and Arkansas all finish 8-4 or 7-5, and Miss St. tumbles back down to earth with a 6-6 season.  November 28th. The stage is set. #3 Florida v. #8 FSU, #4 Georgia v. #7 Georgia Tech., #5 South Carolina v. #6 Clemson, all six teams 10-1, all six teams still very much in the hunt for a playoff bid. Some consider it to be the greatest ACC/SEC rivalry weekend ever. At noon, Georgia Tech looks absolutely unstoppable. Brice Ramsay has a miserable day throwing for 3 interceptions and the yellow jackets win 34-17. Mark Richt quietly cusses under his breathing, having finally lost control. At 3:30, a now healthy Deshaun Watson in his first game back goes off the rails against SC, with 400 yards and four touchdowns in a desperate plea to the committee that Clemson does in fact deserve to be in the playoffs. Clemson wins 45-27. Florida v. Florida State: this game was ugly, with four turnovers by FSU and 2 by the gators in the first three quarters. A touchdown throw by Francois (3 ints so far) is immediately responded to by a touchdown from Grier to put them up 21-20. With 48 seconds left of the clock the Noles return the ball to the 35, then Mario Pender catches a short pass and breaks two tackles to get the noles to the Gators 41 yard line. Three seconds left, 55 yards, Aguayo nails it, Noles win.   Louisville beats Kentucky, by the way, to go 10-2, and for the second consecutive year the ACC goes 4-0 against its rivals. The SEC east has a 2008 Big-12 problem, with all three SEC East teams sharing one division loss, and one OOC loss. In another controversial move  the SEC uses the CFB rankings, where Georgia is ranked in front of Florida, to decide the tiebreaker for the SEC championship game, as opposed to the AP (and every other poll) where Florida is ranked higher.  Quickly, around the rest of the nation, TCU looks to be unstoppable through 10 games before consecutive losses to end the season at Oklahoma and at Baylor putting them 10-2. Baylor loses at Kansas State, but the win over TCU puts them right back in the playoff spotlight at 10-1, before crumbling at home to Texas 28-7. Ohio State turns out to be a huge disappointment, going from no regular season conference losses ever under Meyer to 3 dropping Penn State, Michigan State, AND Michigan. Michigan by the way finishes 9-3, while Harbaughs eccentric personality is GIFd relentlessly throughout the season. By the end of the year, Michigan State as it turns out is THE team to beat in 2015. Wins over Oregon at home, at Michigan, at Nebraska, at OSU, and at Penn State round out an incredible perfect regular season for the Spartans. An easy 31-10 win over Nebraska in the B1G championship secures their playoff spot.   In the PAC12, Oregon loses early to Michigan State putting a damper on their season early, subsequent losses to ASU and Stanford put their season to rest. USC collapses early and fast with losses to Stanford, Arizona State, and Notre Dame. ASU actually starts off very hot with a win over A M, USC, and Oregon later in the season, and even looked like playoff contenders despite the loss to UCLA, but the home loss of Arizona late in November and the PAC12 title loss to Stanford knocks them out for good. Stanford, actually, becomes the national team to beat #2. Winning at USC, against Arizona, against UCLA, and against Oregon makes them a spotlight championship contender. Most of the west coast feels theyre better than Michigan State because of their harder SoS, and they do move briefly to #1 in the AP polls after their win against Oregon. Their regular season ends on a down note with a loss to Notre Dame, but going 12-1 and winning the PAC12 is enough to also secure them a spot in the playoffs uncontroversially.  With two de facto playoff spots in the bag, the race has come down to a de ja vu standoff of Baylor/TCU, now each with two losses, three two loss SEC teams (but with only Georgia viewed as having a real shot, as they are in the SEC championship game), and three one loss ACC teams. The SEC question is answered quickly as LSU turns into a defensive hammer against Georgia, winning 17-10 and then SEC championship as a 10-3 team. In the ACC playoffs the #5 Noles, now more comfortable playing against the triple option a second time this season, hit hard against #4 GT defensively and control the game for the entire second half, avenging their regular season loss.   The final playoff standings end much more controversially than the previous year. #1 Michigan State is easy, so is #2 Stanford. Despite four wins against teams ranked in the top-15, there is still a large contingent of people furious about FSU being ranked #3 because hurr durr ACC and look what happened last time we let them in. Its the number four spot though  11-1 Clemson over #5 Baylor and #6 TCU that has the entire big 12 in an uproar. Despite wins over #23 Pittsburgh, #15 Louisville, #11 Notre Dame,  #10 South Carolina, #8 Georgia Tech, and their only loss to #3 Florida State WITH their Heisman candidate quarterback injured, the Big12 commissioner issues a statement of reproach against the playoff committee for discrimination for not having a championship game.   So here we are with the field set. Michigan State goes to the Cotton bowl to play Clemson. Although the Spartans defense has been very good without Narduzzi, they clearly miss him this game. Connor Cook is expected to go in the top 5 in this years draft, and he shows why  cutting up the Clemson secondary all game long. Michigan State gets the lead early, but a third quarter fumble and a couple of key stops in the run game are the difference for Clemson; Gallman/Williams/Scott/Watson have an absolute field day  scoring in their first five possessions of the second half to pull away and pull the upset 49-41.   Stanford and FSU are giving each other fits  with both Ryan Burns and Francois throwing two interceptions in the first half. Both teams begin to retreat to their more depending run game in the second half; with FSU finding success behind Pender/Cooks speed outside the edges, and the Stanford power run game completely overpowering FSUs Dline. With 2 minutes left in the 4th, Stanford is at their own 16 yard line and is looking to drive into field goal position. Burns looks for a throw over the middle to pick up the first down  but doesnt see Jalen Ramsey, blowing by the tight end blocking on the weakside, hurls himself right into the Burns back. The ball comes out, Jacob Pugh is there to scoop it up. FSU ball. FSU burns the clock down, kicks the easy field goal, and prevents any last minute heroics to beat Stanford 30-27.         Dividing by 0 doesn't work that way.   For one stretch during the game? Absolutely.   deprecating*   You mean all-time great with the Magic? He signed with Orlando before getting injured.   He has plenty of football smarts, just no shoulder strength whatsoever due to multiple surgeries.   Still 2 points worse than Christian Ponder!

Based on how much teams have gotten for disgruntled past stars, I think both teams come out way ahead off of that.    Yep. That just happened :(   Well, Olympics don't factor into your ranking as an all-time NBA player. There are tons of players who have made 5 all-star teams that aren't in the pyramid, but I do think being the 2nd best player on 2 championship teams might tip the scale in his favor... but I do think it's close.   Shoot... forgot to put him on the Players already on the list list. Updating now, thanks.   Well, Steve Nash didn't make an all-star team until he was 27. Some players bloom later than others.   NP man, I do it all the time.   Yes, I'm actually positive he was an all-star.    "In or past"   I'd like to think in this hypothetical the pyramid expands, and the cutoff isn't top-96 but some arbitrary level of career accomplishment that defines you as an "all timer" or something like that.   Roy Hibbert has made the all-star team twice.   Lol, woops, fixing that now.   Well, the Pacer's playoff success probably has a lot to do with the rest of the team (Hibbert, Hill, West, Stephenson, coaching) being better than anything Love/Wall has had up to this season. But the general consensus of Love and Wall being in the upper echelon of NBA players has been happening a lot longer than for PG.   If it matters, I think Wall is probably the lowest on his tier, and Kyrie is probably the highest on the tier below. I see them both as having comparable (in greatness, not in play style) careers but wall being a year ahead and generally having less injury issues gives him the nudge up for me.    Well, Paul Pierce is already number 47, so there's that.   The Former.   Paul George has only had two seasons at a very good/elite level; Wall and Love have both been there for a while longer.  Edit: to respond to your edit, Love has put up better statistical seasons than Bosh ever did in Toronto, Love has only missed the playoffs because it's significantly harder to make the playoffs in the west during Love's tenure in Minnesota with incompetently managed/coached teams. We actually don't know if Love will serve as a better 3rd man than Bosh, because this is only his first year with the Cavs and he's only 26 years old. Bosh's career has pretty much finished being defined at this point, but Love still has at least 5 years of very high quality play left, so it's more of an open question.   I'm sure most of you are familiar with The Big Book of Basketball, and the second half which is dedicated entirely to [The Pyramid](http://www.basketball-reference.com/awards/simmons_pyramid.html), the ranking of the 96 greatest players in NBA history. I'm curious, now that it's been about five years since the last edition of the list was compiled, who do you think has marked a place on the list? Right now we have:  **Active Players already on the list**   Chris Paul   Dwight Howard   Paul Pierce   Dirk   Duncan    Kobe    Lebron   KG   Wade  **Players who have definitely made the list already**   Kevin Durant   Carmelo Anthony    **Soon will, as long as their career doesn't end today**   Russell Westbrook   Stephen Curry   James Harden    **Too soon to say, but it's likely they will**    Anthony Davis   Kevin Love   Demarcus Cousins   Blake Griffin   John Wall    **Too soon to say if they're on that trajectory yet**   Paul George   Kawhi Leonard   Kyrie Irving   Andre Drummond   Jimmy Butler   Damian Lillard    **In or past their prime, with a borderline/outside shot of making it on**   Lamarcus Aldridge    Pau Gasol   Marc Gasol   Al Horford   Amare Stoudamire   Chris Bosh   Zach Randolph   Derrick Rose*   Tony Parker   Manu    I'm excluding players in their first two years, because anyone who says anything about Gobert, Giannis, Dipo, Noel, Wiggins, Parker et. al. is just wild speculation at this point.  *I realize how controversial it is to leave an MVP off the list, but given the historical backlash of saying he didn't deserve it, and assuming his career of playing at an elite level is over by now, I really don't think Rose will be looked back on much better than Penny Hardaway or Brandon Roy.   I think one thing that's going to benefit us a ton next year is that our schedule starts of with just about all of our easy games. Depending on how you feel about Boston College, we don't have our first real test until like game #5, and our two hardest games are #7 and #9. This should give us a lot of time to find our identity with both the O-line and the D-line. Additionally, all those not-our-toughest-challenges-but-could-ruin-our-season-with-a-loss mid-tier opponents of Louisville, Miami, and NCState are all at Doak.   Those two factors combined, I actually think we *could* have a pretty low ceiling (hardest games are all away) but a pretty low floor (the must-wins are all at home).   The offsetting piece is that we don't have a goddamned clue what a single position on either side of the ball will look like, except for at RB.... So who knows.    As a Magic fan, I'm actually very invested in you guys getting the Lakers pick, because the Lakers owe Orlando their first round pick 2 years after they convey their first to Philly, so if they give you yours next year we don't get ours until 2018. And I don't think the lakers are going to be that bad that long.    Well, worse case you actually finish below 5th... which there's a 17.2% chance of happening.   Well, I basically said that at the end...   1. Their own pick  2. LA Lakers first round pick, currently protected 1-5 for 2015. Assuming the Lakers finish the season in the 4th-to-last spot, there is a 17.2% chance that they will fall outside the top 5 and the pick will be sent to Philly this year.  3. Miami's first round pick, protected 1-10. This one is interesting, because if Miami sneaks into the playoffs it will drop to 15th, and they're currently .5 games out of the playoffs. But if either Indiana or Charlotte end up passing them, they'll be in the 10th spot in the lottery pick, and will only have a 9.1% of falling outside the top 10 in the draft. Right now Indiana and Charlotte are only .5 and 1.5 games behind them respectively. Philly is walking a pretty tight rope with this one.  4. Oklahoma City, currently protected 1-18. Right now in order to fall outside the top 18, the Thunder would have to pass both the Pelicans and the Wizards. They are currently 2.5 games behind the Wizards with about 5 games left to play.    It's interesting to me how the most likely scenario here is that they don't get any of the protected draft picks and end up with only 1 in 2015, but there is an incredibly small possibility that they could end up drafting #1, 6, 11, and 19 this year if some games and ping pong balls break their way.    Even ignoring the NFL aspect, the fact that we won every regular season game by 14 points or more, and 13 of them by 27 points or more, is pretty unprecedented. So is having the #1 offense AND number #1 defense in the nation in the same year.    http://www.reddit.com/r/CFB/comments/2sd2bv/ranking_the_top_10_teams_of_the_decade_so_far/   For Orlando fans, it's more just a tired joke. They've been making that Joke since late '12 when Vuc started putting up big numbers.   I have *never* seen a ranking of all time greats putting Kareem behind Bird, Kobe, or Shaq, so I'm not sure what you're talking about.   Marcus Smart above Elfrid Payton is terrible.    He doesn't have the minutes to be ROY. People are right in leaving him out.    Well if you'd like to multiply the probability of each win given certain prior events occurring by the probability of those prior events occurring then be my guest haha, but that's going to get a bit complex for a reddit post. I think this isn't a terrible way to look at your expectations for the season for how simple an exercise it is though.   1 Texas State      1 USF   .7 Boston College   .95 @Wake Forest   .7 Miami   .7 Louisville   .5 @Georgia Tech   .9 Syracuse    .5 @Clemson   .75 NC State   1 Chattanooga   .5 @UF    **Projected Total Wins = 9.3**   Look at your 12 Games for the upcoming season. Make a wild guess as to the probability of winning each game, represented as a decimal where "1" is a 100% chance of winning. Add the totals together. This is your expected win total or the 2015 season.   Florida State! Nobody has any goddamn clue what our team is going to look like or how good we're going to be so it will just be one season long wild ride.  Talent pulls through, defense improves in the 2nd year of our new system, WR's step up, and Maguire turns out to be really good? We could go 12-1 and be ACC champions!  Inexperience, injuries, and lack of LB depth kills us on defense, Charles Kelly prove to be inept at defensive coordinator, new O-line experiences significant growing pains, and Maguire isn't the answer at QB? We could be 7-5 at the end of the year.  Nobody knows anything and everything is a mystery.    1. V02 max is, in short, a measurement of your body's maximum  ability to consume oxygen for the purpose of burning glucose as energy. Thus the more oxygen you can use the more energy you will have available for primarily aerobic exercises like running, biking, rowing, etc.  2. V02 max actually has only a very rough correlation with performance in endurance sports, and there are *tons* of other factors that go into making an athlete great, especially in "skilled" sports like the NHL and NFL. Additionally, V02 max does not always or often with increased cardiovascular fitness, despite what a lot of misinformed articles will have you believe. It's not something that you will progressively improve with time like a lift#. Here's a good excerpt of an article I was reading recently:     In addition to lactate differences, other factors such as the individuals substrate use, fiber type, and other physiological variables will all vary considerably at a fixed percent of VO2max. This was demonstrated in a recent study by Vollaard et al. (2009). The study showed that while on average improvements were seen in a variety of endurance parameters after six weeks of endurance training, the individuality of the response was widespread with some showing even negative responses to the training, even though the training was at the same 70%VO2max intensity for all subjects (Vollaard et al., 2009). The study showed that there was a wide range of adaptation in maximal and submaximal tests including VO2 parameters, muscle enzyme activity, and metabolite levels. An interesting finding in the study is that low responders for an increased VO2max were not low responders in other parameters. The change in VO2max did not correlate with the change in performance on a time trial, which is a significant finding demonstrating that perhaps more attention should be paid to changing in performance instead of manipulating physiological parameters such as VO2max. One has to question the training recommendations based on training designed at improving parameters such as VO2max, with the assumption being that performance will improve because of it, when studies show that change in VO2max are often not linked with a change in performance. This phenomenon of varied response is not new and can be seen in a wide array of training situations, such as altitude training for example (Chapman et al., 1998).    The tl;dr is that for improvement in endurance training, V02 max is just one of a whole bunch of different variables.    I feel like you don't get it though.   oversimplifying running to what essentially says "just do HIIT" is just straight up bad advice for general cardiovascular fitness.     We're at 36 now I believe.   Right now Magic, Stockton, Oscar, Isaiah Thomas, and Bob Cousy are all EASILY better than Chris Paul in the "if his career ended today" sense.   I would put him a tier back from the cousy/Thomas/Stockton group for now - somewhere alongside Rick Barry, Steve Nash, Jason Kidd, and Gary Payton.  If he leads the team to a chip or goes ~4 more years at an elite level, that's another story, but no, he is not one of the five greatest of all time.   Are you serious?   Give me all the calories. All of them.   Nerlens Noel is making a serious charge, averaging 10.2pts/12.5rb/3.7stl/2blk in the month of March so far - and actually now has a higher PER for the season than Wiggins. But Wiggin's 15.7ppg alone puts him so far ahead of every other rookie in scoring (the next rookie who has played at least 30 games is Jordan Clarkson at 9.4ppg) that he might be too settled in the eyes of the voters. Mirotic and Nurkic might be the actual *best* playing rookies, but they simply haven't gotten the minutes to compete. Elfird Payton looks like he's going to be the best PG in the class for sure (9th best assist rate in the NBA right now as a rookie! 17th in steals/36) but he's way too deficient on offense to be considered now. Other players have had brief streaks of success  here and there (Galloway, McDaniels) but it looks like we're down to two real contenders.    6'2, 180lbs, 25   - been lifting for a couple months now and am looking to move into a more intermediate routine with higher volume.  - I've injured my knee before doing squats (and that was after a considerable amount of form work) and am deathly afraid of attempting them again, so leg work is going to have to come from other sources.  - I'm looking to work solely on aesthetics, and for some reason my arms just blow up in proportion to my core; so I think one iso exercise for bi's/tri's *should* be enough, especially considering the amount of tertiary work they're getting in major lifts.

          You might confuse people with that. What you mean is that over the year to year records for the last ten months **each** of these items is a record. I was unaware of what you say, but it is indeed s significant fact.   Actually he's doing no such thing. Have a look at his posting history, and you may begin to understand why he is possibly the *most banned person on reddit*. As I have said before I am not the only person he copies from, and actually not the major one. He has bots that scan certain people and subreddits to pick up what they post and repost it, not uncommonly in more than 15 or 20 places. In actual fact postnationalism is the most **ultimate** points grabber I have seen in all my years on reddit. Also, to repeat myself I have made it plain *several* times that I don't give a shit if he copies anything of mine without attribution **except for** items that come from r/worldanarchism . That is a sub that I wish to promote because it has a clear and consistent ideology that I wish to propagate. As for pn he will gladly repost totally contradictory opinions for the sake of his karma. He *doesn't care*.  I don't know how many times I have communicated my displeasure with pn's parasitism to him, but I most certainly intend to continue doing so. Now, as to pn's being a "friend of the workers", once more examine what he actually posts. In fact he has only *two* political views, maybe three if you include his use of 'free speech' as a defence after he offends people for totally non-political reasons.  These two views are 1) being in support of open immigration - which is ok **and** continued promotion of any and all free trade agreements which, of course **reduce wages** and not only in the wealthier countries but in the poorer countries that sign them. That's it. Nothing more. To misquote Churchill, "some living, some wage". The 'dialogue' about a 'living wage' is all over the internet, and you can easily find it. If you want to stick to reddit follow r/labor, r/progressive, r/demsocialist, any of the 'reform' socialist subreddits launched in disgust with the Stalinist influence at r/socialism or God knows how many more.  The last time pn and his habits were discussed on this board was about 3 months ago See http://www.reddit.com/r/AnarchistNews/comments/31hxwo/so_upostnationalist_seems_to_be_blatently? (The title continues "...spamming/trolling us at this point). A lot of the evidence presented there was in reference to my own posts, but at least one other person chimed in with how pn was "reposting his items **within seconds**" of his posting them.   I said there what I said here today. I didn't care then about his copying in matters unconnected to the subreddit I am presently promoting. I, however, have opinions that I wish to promote, and unlike pn I have promoted these opinions for coming on 45 years *without any personal gain* and sometimes with personal loss. This sort of willingness to fight for a cause is alien to the mind of somebody like pn who is dedicated only to himself. If I was a better person I'd pity him, but my moral development isn't that high.  There is a simple solution for pn - if he ever stops acting like a two bit con man - in my case. He can post anything from me that is not connected with r/worldanarchism under the pretense he has found it and is familiar with it or even vaguely knowledgeable about the issues involved. When, however, he attempts to pretend concern about issues that are promoted by r/worldanarchism I *demand* proper credit **because** the causes promoted there are *very much not anything to do with any personal advantage of mine*.  That's it, except for the fact that it is a sign of maturity to not begin comments -even on the internet - with the words "fuck off".             Still another item copied from r/worldanarchism with neither permission nor proper attribution.   Yet another item copied from r/worldanarchism with neither permission nor proper attribution   Once more yet another item copied from r/worldanarchism with neither permission nor proper attribution.                                          If you had bothered to look it up rather than depending on your social circles you could have spared yourself a lot of embarrassment. Please try googling 'wu mao' to come upon the [following Wikipedia article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/50_Cent_Party) . To save you the trouble of reading the whole thing here is a relevant passage:  "*The term is derogatorily applied by cynical Chinese netizens to any person who blatantly expresses pro-Communist Party thoughts online.[4] However, there's another word "5 US cent ()" used by some pro-party netizens to denigrate anti-party, pro-democracy comments, with the implication that those commentators are hired by the governments of the United States, Taiwan or other "western" countries. Zhang Shengjun, a professor of international politics at Beijing Normal University published an article Who would be afraid of the cap of "50 Cent Party"? on the Chinese version of Global Times, claiming that spread by western media outfits, "it has become a baton waved towards all Chinese patriots" to make the Chinese government a constant target of criticism.[6][34]*"  [Here](https://chinese.yabla.com/chinese-english-pinyin-dictionary.php?define=wu+mao) is the dictionary definition where 'hairless' occurs. The tone of the words is different, but without the accents they are the same when transliterated into Latin script.  I think you are quite confused and very willing to leap into battle with imaginary Communists at the drop of a hat. To repeat myself, not *everyone* who brings up a piece of writing from China is therefore a supporter of its government.        Look it up. You'll find that the term is indeed used by the two different groups. That is the irony of its use, and that is what is amusing to someone looking in on the way people use it. It seems there is some side taking here and both sides fail to comprehend that the vast majority of people are on neither side of their internet battle. 'Wu mao' as in hairless is a homonym in Pinyin just as "hare" and "hair" are in English.      It's true that the studies of people like this don't include the 'accounting factor'. On the other hand the gain in worker health can be taken as a 'public relations point' that provides value beyond the usual internal accounting of an organization. The work of presenting it to employers as a "for your own good" item has still to be done.   Yes, it is very much that.         I guess it's possible. Amethyst is basically silicon dioxide, and both silicon and oxygen are common elements on comets. The color comes from iron impurities, along with other transition elements, and there is no reason that these can't be present in at least small quantities on comets. On the other hand amethyst is a form of quartz which, on Earth at least, is a product of either igneous rock formation or hot springs. I don't think such conditions have ever been present in comet formation, though I am not expert enough to totally rule it out.   My opinion is that you should continue with the present format of both news and discussion. I have a low opinion of 'discussion' subs on reddit, and hopefully the presence of news anchors the discussion to something at least slightly connected to reality. There is presently another subreddit titled 'r/radicalfeminism' that is, if not dead, at least comatose. You might consider cpr for it if you are interested. Give it a good think first.                               Interesting article. I note that the author is quite happy in quoting the 109 out of 201 members of the Syriza Central Committee who signed the statement against the government's acceptance of the EU terms. They are less forthcoming with the fact that the 39 MPs who didn't vote for the agreement were outnumbered by the rest of the 149 Syriza reps. Nor do they mention the fact that some of these 39 either abstained or were conveniently absent at the time of the vote.   It's a normal human failing, selectively choosing the evidence, but it gives a distorted picture of the strength of the Syriza 'left'. It should also be pointed out that the author refers to *3* different oppositions within Syriza, 'Left Platform, Left Current' and 'Red Network'. The opposition to the 'moderates' in power within the party are anything but a united force.   Personally I wouldn't hope for much success on their part. The difference between the numbers in the CC and the numbers in Parliament show one thing that anyone familiar with faction fighting in social democratic parties know. The winners, who are pretty well always on the right wing, have a clear realistic picture of what realpolitik it takes to win. They will set out to capture the important levers of power within the party. The leftist islands can be left for a later cleanup. The leftists, meanwhile, are almost always obsessed with having the 'correct program', the fine details of which they will argue endlessly about with each other while the world outside goes on. I wonder exactly how one is 'elected' to the CC of Syriza.  What happens in the next year will be interesting to watch. The situation is complex because not only is Syriza a coalition of factions but so are the oppositions, both inside and outside the party. For me it's like a refresher course, so to speak, of how social democratic parties operate internally.   Given the relative youth of the party the controlling elements haven't had time to develop the usual unspoken levers of control that the right wing of such parties usually has - I "think", there may be routes of influence impossible to see from the outside or even to the 'inside' of nave but enthusiastic members unconnected with a faction.   Syriza is also different from a lot of social democratic parties in the Anglosphere in that there is no 'two front battle' within affiliated unions. Or, to second guess myself again are there also union battlegrounds in those brought in by PASOK deserters to Syriza ? Watch these buggers. They are crafty indeed as the case of both Spain and France has shown. The bureaucrats are totally able to change their visible ideological clothes while never getting up from the desks they occupy.                            There's actually a long background to the story that the article doesn't mention. Even though present consensus says "no connection" there is a long standing dispute about pollutants from the tar sands and higher cancer rates downstream. As far as I can see the FN involved, Fort McMurray 468 First Nation, has sort of "made peace" with the oil companies, but the matter still simmers. The FN has a [Facebook Page](http://www.facebook.com/pages/Fort-McMurray-468-First-Nation/480886971005) which is presently not vehement on the matter, but should conditions change....      You know what I like about the term "w mo" ? Besides meaning "hairless" it is **both** an accusation that one is a paid agent of Beijing **and** that one is a paid agent of right wing anti-China interests. It's a wonderful all-purpose insult.                  That's true. It is, however, the local populations who suffer the worst.            this is good news.                                    I really don't know about the strength of the solar wind in the vicinity of Pluto though I suspect your statement has some merit. As to helium (and other gases) the molecules don't have to have the energy implied in 'escape velocity' to *gradually* be lost from a planet's atmosphere. All that is required is the kinetic energy needed to move "a little bit up" from a gravitational source (the planet). Given time the molecules gradually drift, bit by bit, away from the planet. With each tiny step the energy required to make the next one becomes less and less. I presume this is what you imply in your last statement. Release any gas at ground level and at least 'some' of it diffuses upward, gravity or not.   There are probably at least a few success stories, but I'm of the opinion that the overall picture isn't so pretty. At the time of the Haiti earthquake, and earlier after Hurricane Katrina, there was a lot of questioning about what was the best NGO to donate to. The Red Cross was definitely *not* one of them. There is a group, [Charity Navigator](http://www.charitynavigator.org) , that provides a good evaluation of various NGOs.   I think your summary has a lot of merit, though I may disagree on points. In any case the item posted is from a mainland news outlet which is somewhat critical of government policy but not overly so (for obvious reasons). It's one Chinese view amongst many.                                                                                                      Nobody can anticipate all possible mishaps.                     Well done.   I think that in most countries you are right. In some cases, however, there may be good grounds for doing both at once. France is an example.                  Here are a few online resources that I hope will be of help:  1)The IWW itself has a good history file with numerous items. See http://www.iww.org/history   2)Jim Crutchfield's IWW Page. See http://www.workerseducation.org/crutch  3)University of Washington's 'Strike' page (mostly for the Pacific Northwest) See http://depts.washington.edu/labhist/encyclopedia/browse.shtml#iww  4)Marxists.org IWW file. See http://www.marxists.org/history/usa/unions/iww  5)Libcom has an archive of IWW pamphlets over the years. See https://libcom.org/exhaustive-list-iww-pamphlets  This file even contains G. Jewell's 1975 'History of the IWW in Canada'. People of my age may remember Jewell with less than total fondness.  6)I even found an online source for Fred Thompson's book on the history of the IWW. See http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015073497490;view=1up;seg=5 . Holy copyright violation Batman ! Get it while it's still up. An excellent book.  Hope this helps. B         Actually postnationalism's personal sub for "anarchist stuff" is "postnationalist" rather than "postnationalism". I think he ran into trouble with the second title. He also has gained control of some other subreddits (he searches reddit for dead subs to take over) and has started at least one on his own. Postnationalist is far from being the most active or popular anarchist sub. That title is held, unfortunately, by r/anarchism from which postnationalism was banned a long time ago.  The guy is certainly in the running for the title of "Most Banned User on Reddit". The great majority of his bans have been for behavior that was in no sense 'political'. His case has been discussed before on this board.  I'll try and get back to this unpleasant subject later.            Enough is enough. I'm only tolerant up to a point. Some people will never learn. This post is yet another item copied from r/worldanarchism without either permission nor proper attribution by postnationalism. In this case his bot picked the item up **13 seconds** after I first posted it and reposted it here.   I've made some unpleasant efforts to make this person see reason. As I said I don't care at all if he copies anything I post on reddit **except for** things that come from r/worldanarchism as that is a sub I wish to promote. So...to make myself totally clear **every single post on r/worldanarchism** is open for anyone to copy **except** for postnationalism. From this point forward anytime he does this it is understood that I have said "**no**" for all time.   I am not the only person, and certainly not the most prolific one, that postnationalism parasites on. The main poster here, u/shatterededifice , will be copied on r/blackflag to the tune of 10 times for every time he copies me. That would be fine and good if postnationalism were to **ever** credit this board as the source of his material. Nope, he wants to pretend that he actually reads the items he posts or perhaps even glances at them.                                                   I don't think so, but it could have been a contributing factor. Perhaps the FBI investigation may turn up something that suggests that the police knew something about the victim at some point. Even if they did, however, there is no guarantee that such facts can be found. Is each search in a police computer logged and saved ? I don't know.   Well it may certainly be 'incomplete'. The thing is that it offers a metric that can be based on actual numbers. When you get into things like "importance" or "presentation" you enter a world of opinion rather than fact.   Why would you call Varoufakis a "coward" ?   When I think about it you are almost certainly right. There are usually cameras even in the toilets. This will hopefully come out in the inquiry.      The item above was copied from r/worldanarchism and posted without either permission nor proper attribution.            Very good. I am quite impressed. I'm going to reread this in the morning.      That seems like a balanced attitude to me.          I think I agree with you here. A female 'Thor' seems somewhat forced. I remember a superhero by the name of 'Valkyrie' , and I think it would have been better to have revived her while staying in the same mythos.            This is an interesting article. By coincidence I have just finished reading a book on the founding of the Labour Party ie its 'prehistory'. Not that the analogy is totally the same, but said book shows how what was a very small minority eventually became a major political force. The path was complicated and devious, but reading about how such struggles overcame seemingly insurmountable obstacles shows that there is hope even if one is originally small. Different results this time I'm sure we all hope.            It's a valid point. It is, however, better than using *rustle* to signify the turning of pages.            Maybe they do. Probably they don't. The two authors are the usual run-of-the-mill journalists. The vast majority of journalists who write for non-expert publications aren't closely connected, are not experts, to the fields they write about. People who write for Rolling Stone are only rarely musicians themselves. The only example to the contrary I can think of is 'Scientific American', and even they have to rely on regular science journalists rather than experts from time to time.  I'm sure that there are some things about the comics medium that you would have liked to have seen included. Can you explain. It might be interesting. As an old time comic collector I can say that the wider implications of the comic book world are interesting to me.    It hopefully will be. It shows that, at least, the incident is being investigated by an outside agency.            Thanks for the link. I'd forgotten about the Archie gay character. Frankly I would have thought that Archie would be the last publisher to catch up with the times.                     A few thoughts on the above:  1)I note with pleasure the end of paragraph ie "...with political unity in the organization but not necessarily full ideological unity". In this they, along with Embat and Apoyo Mutuo, seem to be following the lead of Latin American 'especifist' groups rather than the 'platformist' groups in Europe, North America and South Africa. Not that the platformists have ever been very successful in their quest for 'ideological unity'. In practice they have all been far more pluralistic than their goal of 'unity in theory' might suggest. Far more pluralistic, in fact, than their 'post-left' critics are. I have generally been supportive of the platformist efforts, but setting a goal of 'unity of thought' has always seemed counterproductive to me. Never mind that, for various reasons, it has proven to be impossible in practice - thank God.  2)These sort of organizations have set themselves the goal of being open and public. In this they differ from the still existing FAI of Spain which remains rather closed, and hasn't seemed to 'take off' in the way the anarchosyndicalist unions have. To my mind this is also very wise.  3)The problem of disorganization and a 'retreat from the world' that Aunar, Apoyo Mutuo and Embat complain of is actually far less prominent in Spain than amongst anarchists elsewhere. To see this problem in its full "*glory*' the comrades should look at the USA. There is a significant faction in American anarchism that seems quite determined to be as separate as possible from ordinary people whom they hold in great contempt. These people glory in their isolation, seeing it as some strange sign of superiority, and they do their damnedest to be as unappealing as possible. To them attempting to actual appeal to ordinary people is a grievous sign of not being radical enough - *and therefore not being superior enough*. Isolation is bad. Fooling yourself that it is good is worse.   4) The Aunar document mentions the problem of a tendency to think in terms of 'grand abstractions' rather than whatever problems are at hand and can be at least partially solved. This has often been a problem amongst anarchists, and it's good to see it being addressed in an organized fashion. I hope they have the best of success.                     It's not like they are being 'voted on' by people from across the world, but government's do in fact react to the idea that they are being watched. If for no other reason than the fact that *all* governments contain factions that are in competition with each other, and sometimes the 'moderate' faction finds such exposure useful in the internal battles. No, the Sudanese government is not made up of 'nice people', but some are worse than others.                          	204
 Go to youtube and search "food tube focaccia" that's a great video on two types of focaccia bread. I added some sun dried tomato paste to the dough for extra flavour :P      nah PSU is fine. In terms of performance which is better?   it really did... (   )   Pros and cons of both these cards? [This GTX 560](http://images.anandtech.com/doci/4344/ASUSTop.jpg) or [This GTX 650ti (the left one)](http://images.hardwarecanucks.com/image//skymtl/GPU/GTX-750-TI-REVIEW/GTX-750-TI-REVIEW-4.JPG)   cant that leave bits on paper behind?   "10 guy sounds like a cool dude, bruh"   I met this girl on DayZ, turns out she lived 30 miles away, skip ahead 3 years and i'm with the most beautiful amazing woman i've ever known and she's a firm believer of the PCMasterRace. I honestly think i might be the luckiest man alive for randomly meeting her online and living so close xD   Yeh I had the same issue. I now use a logitech G400 and it's the best mouse I've ever used.   Have a look at the Mionix Naos series of mice.   Just dont call me, im busy.      still dont get why Vi isnt called The Piltover Pugilist.   then why can you dodge fizz ult but not cait ult? doesnt that sound like a bug to you?   Zed can still die in his ult and Yi can still die in his Q, these bugs have been around since like season 3....    you should never skimp on the PSU dude. If that fucks up, literally everything in your PC could fuck up :/   It removes player choice and makes Zed extremely predictable. Bjergsen said he's completely stopped playing Zed due to it.   Since the last patch, every time the nexus blows up there's a new explosion noise played.  Here's my plight with the new sound; I play a lot of Zed and at the end of a game, just before we're about to win and blow up the nexus i like to quickly type "/j" (the joke emote) in which Zed says "Forbidden shadow wins!". HOWEVER since the new explosion noise has been added to the nexus blowing up, it muffles Zed's voice! This is absolutely game breaking  Riot i will be writing a strongly worded letter to your player support team each day until this is fixed.   "im not making mistakes" are you top 10 challenger? xD   If you blame your team instead of purely focusing on your mistakes then your not gonna get out of gold. You're making mistakes, you're just not seeing them.   Was it by badministrator? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HW2jGKfKSU list=PLA2EB9D1C236F6274   UGH BUT MY TEAM MATES SUCK EVEN WHEN I TELL THEM TO STOP FEEDING LIKE STUPID BRONZE KIDDIES! /s   there's no secret to gaining elo it's really just a case of working on what you already know like CS well, dont back when your mid laner is roaming (if you play mid that is), dont go for a kill unless you're 100% sure it'll be a success. It really is just a case of working on what you know and making small tweaks constantly. Oh and LOOK AT YOUR MAP MORE YOU DONT DO IT ENOUGH   lol only 3 years?   So you're saying they should start paying the art department less so they can pay other departments more? That would certainly cause backlash you realise right?    Those in charge of maintaining the severs are not the same group of people as those who make the skins.....   	26
       This is not the point, nor is it the case.  There's a reason why they wanted the Xeon Phi. Because for supercomputing applications, it's either that or the (also U.S-dev'd) GPU accelerators.   The actual point is that the U.S. just hastened the development of competitive chips (lower price, power, etc). This was probably happening already, but it was a firm kick in the ass to start kicking ass.  The people that design the policies and trade restrictions do so in a technological vacuum.         I wish more areas organized things like this. Was it through a group, an overnight camping-camp for younger folks? How neat for you!   Should be next Monday early in the morning Frankfurt time.               Would love to know where on the planet this came from. I can find almandine quite easily, but nothing gemmy like this.   I, for one, am totally excited for the zombie apocalypse.   The slow churn to economic misery, er, not so much. But zombies! Yes! I can do that.   Oddly enough all I see here are the crinoid stems and chert nodules but Oklahoma is home to the best of any of my bryozoan specimens.       That would be a fit then... I am not a geologist either, I study and find for fun. But I've learned quite a bit through the years.   I second specularite but can better confirm if I know the region/state area it came from.   Unfortunately HPC is a very "it depends" proposition. I don't think what you're usibg scales to that many cores anyway and honestly, CD Adaptco can advise in depth on the best cluster configuration for that application set. Then learning becomes an experience process.   So much CFD is done on workstations. But for building clusters turned for ANSYS and other applications, sometimes it helps to attend training sessions at user conferences. I know ANSYS has them, in fact, most do. Other integrators do training sessions for end users but would be happy to host someone looking to learn. And the universities with HPC centers would prob be willing to chat hardware with you. Always read stuff too, there's not a lot of HPC specific stuff that isn't PR from HPCwire, which used to be great before they lost their good writers, but Beowulf boards (Beowulf.org) is great for specific questions    What level and type? That would mean, for what purpose? As someone architecting HPC systems or programming? More detail about what the net result you're looking for will get you a direct and focused answer.   That is a brilliant answer, by the way.    Right, which is different than data capacity (i.e. storage, I/O systems, etc).. It's a pretty common bit of lingo for infrastructure folks although to the outside world it might sound a bit archaic.       Here I was, imagining some lovely scene--an older gentleman with a pleasant backyard shed full of fine polished wonders. All the children dropping in to see what beautiful cabochons he is working on today. And now I cannot unsee that comment.   Were these "freestanding" or pulled/chipped away from host sediment?   All watched over by the Borg Master nodes.   A service economy without a middle class. About as sustainable as a middle class without a service evonomy...   Weird... It showed up in my Google News feed like actual news.    I think the point was that the lecture misses the obvious points. I watched the whole thing expecting to hear something meaningful about what can practically be done about dstacenters in... Unfortunate locations. Ended up more of an amusement for 25 min of time. The fact is, why build there at all when power is cheaper outside of CA in particular. Never address.      Yes. My point is that the likelihood of calcite growing out amethyst like that is...suspect.   That does not seem like something that would actually happen.                        Note the subheadline....but the retail business is slogging. Luckily every single web service we rely on (from Netfllix to Reddit itself) is feeding the AWS beast. http://aws.amazon.com/solutions/case-studies/reddit/      TL;DR - Finally, pricing for 100Gb switching.   There really should be a r/PrettySlag subreddit :)   I saw on Mindat where there has been some amethyst dug in Oak Ridge, NC, which is an unlikely place. Do you find this other places other than western NC? I've seen bits here and there but nothing of any quality size/formation wise east of Black Mountain.   Amazing finds. I've picked up some of far less quality there in the open digging areas behind the "mine" in Hiddenite, but never anything like this. Is this from the mine, quarry, or digging areas at Emerald Hollow? (Which, btw, appears to contain zero in the way of any sort of emerald material)/   Almost looks like bismuth that's been recrystallized. Would be interested to see what it looked like in matrix/when found.   The top one looked like crinoid stem bits to me.                  Probably did a number on a tile saw. Do you use it often for finds and does it work well?      Finally the mainstream press does something to give the average reader some context. This is well done.         Hah! Perfect response.... and about the right era too.            My only find of this nature was in southern California and only a tiny fragment in some ugly host rock. Forgot how -alien- these things look--almost fake.           	65

             Why? I believe this is the future of flash drives. You can connect more devices than just your PC.      Joe enters the confessional and tells the priest that he has committed adultery. "Oh, no," said the priest, thinking of the most promiscuous women in town. "Was it with Marie Brown?" "I'd rather not say who it was." "Was it with Betty Smith?" "I'd rather not say," says Joe. So the priest gives him absolution and Joe leaves. While leaving the church, Joe's friend asks if he received absolution. "Yes, and two very good leads!"      It's time for the truth...!     	10
 "Prakash" was using an alias from the outset, besides which he was no innocent man.   But, I have his lap-top now, and all his accounts were logged in when I found it in his living room. I don't much care if his reputation, and my confession get buried as far down as him.    That after his death his online accounts will be anonymously usurped and his reputation ruined.    I'm *really* sorry to hear about your sister, man. Do whatever you can to defender her, once you get out. Creepy-ass brothel owner...I tell you man, it's this damn city. It attracts the worst kind.    Nothing but great things, I'm sure. ;)   This Twigsy guy really knows his craft. I've got to respect that on some level.    You vaguely remind me of my creepy-ass, late brother-in-law.    Aneurysm my ass, she was young and in great health, doesn't make sense.    I truly regret leaving home at age 16. They say I was estranged, but really Diane was the strange one. I may have spent my better years rabble-rousing and getting into trouble but that's how you turn out when you're a dumb-ass kid who runs away from home.  I just don't see how my parents let Diane turn out the way she did. By the time I was back in my baby sister's life, she was married to this sleazy, disingenuous "Prakash", guy. Now, I'm a born again Christian, that's why I ultimately turned myself around and came back home. But Prakash, he was hard to place. When I tried to talk to him about matters of faith, he'd claim to be an atheist, or agnostic. Or he'd say "There are many paths to God.", dodgy as fuck if you ask me, most likely because he came from some ass-backwards terrorist background.  I could tell, because Diane talked like she was part of some kooky spiritual cult. Plus, she was always acting like some provincial house wife: cooking for him, and tidying their home like a neurotic house keeper... Oppressive bastard.  Well, shortly after I returned from my exploits as prodigal son, Prakash stole my chance to make up for lost time with my beloved sister. Maybe he did it because he knew I could help her see the light again: the light of Christ, the light of her own upbringing, the light of modern society - the light to which my sweet sister had sympathetically blindfolded herself, on account of her marriage to that morally blind terrorist creep.  I find the circumstances of Diane's death highly suspicious, as there were no witness besides Prakash. And, do you know what that mother fucker did, right after killing my dear sister? He took a three week vaction to India. He took Diane's ashes along with him, selfish bastard. So now we don't even have a grave site to visit her at. He claimed that she had mentioned, on a few occasions, wishing that her ashes be placed in some "Yamina River". Why on earth would my sister want a nutty thing like that?  Well, according to Prakash, he believed Diane sent him out on this wild quest because she secretly thought it would be good for him. That she would have wanted him to take his mind off his grief by going on an adventure, and finally getting in touch with his distant family members in India.  Sure, Prakash. I'm so sure Diane's final wishes were all about you, man. I'm sure she was so concerned about helping you find some inner-peace-enlightenment-bullshit at the bottom of some filthy river. Right. It wasn't so you could go search for a new terrorist bride or anything like that at all, now was it...  But by now you can see, why Prakash had to die.  I went over to his house, around ten at night. I brought two six packs of beer, thinking it would make my job easier, but from the look and smell of him when he opened the door I could tell what I brought was negligible compared to what he'd already imbibed. I told him I was missing Diane, and asked if I could come in and chat. He let me in, and cleared some blankets off the living room couch so we could sit. The living room was a mess, the coffee table was littered with excessively dogeared and folded-open books.   Empty beer cans adorned the floor. I shoved some books out of the way (knocking some to the floor to join the beer cans) to make room for the six packs.  Prakash seemed amiable enough, but drunk and half asleep. After enough small talk and beer was had, I got down to the heart of the matter. "I miss my sister, Prakash. I hadn't seen her in such a long time, and once I was finally back in her life, she was taken from me." I had hoped this would stir something in that guilty conscience of his, but he just muttered some self-righteous bullshit about her being in a better place.  I finally cut to the chase. "Did you kill her, Prakash?" My question seemed to cut through his stupor, as he stared at me, wide eyed, and stammered a denial.  "Well, we'll let fate decide, shall we." I said as I produced the first gun from my jacket. Prakash watched as I loaded a single bullet, and spun the cylinder.  I set the gun down on the table in front of us, then produced the second (fully loaded) gun and trained it on Prakash. "This is called Russian Roulette. I know you killed my sister, now this is your judgement day. If you refuse to let God be your judge, then I will be your judge. Now, there is an eleven in twelve chance you will be spared. Do you really think God would let that one in twelve bullet find it's way into your head, if you're truly an innocent man?"  "My God, Don, I didn't kill her! I loved her! I still love her! I did not kill Diane!" he shouted, sweat now beading up on his face.  "Don't invoke God if you're not willing to let him judge you." I said. "And, believe me when I say I am up to the task of acting on his behalf. Your deadline is fast approaching Prakash. Decide and make your peace. 10...9..."  As I began my count down Prakash cast about the room as though looking for escape or help, and I leaned in closer with my own gun, inches from his face. He picked up the gun from the table and held it to his head. His breath quickened until he was practically hyperventilating.   With his other hand he picked up a near by picture of Diane and stared at it. I was hoping he'd utter a confession or an apology. "Truth alone triumphs." he said in a quavering voice, and then pulled the trigger.  The gun emitted an impotent "click" and nothing more...   *God Dammit! do I have to do everything myself!? What the hell happened to that sure-fire bullet I'd left in the chamber!? Had the fucking thing jammed!? Oh well, I guess God does help those who help themselves.*   I grabbed a pillow and shoved it against the back of Prakash's head, while he was vomiting on the floor. The silencer and pillow reduced the sound and mess of the gunshot.  A garbage bag nicely concealed the body and accompanying evidence, as I loaded them into my truck. An apparent suicide would have been more ideal, but from what I understand Prakash was sort of the black sheep of his own family. And if there's one thing I've learned it's that when you're a black sheep, no one looks  very hard for you.  I drove Prakash's body so far into the dessert, that it'll be at least a decade before the shores of our ever expanding city approach it, and buried it so far down that even the vultures will never get a tantalizing glimpse.  See you in hell, asshole.   Thanks a lot, yaar :)   Thank you.   	10
 Mine were raised. Looked just like hers actually. My doctor said it was a remedy that could be used either way.    Is it common to find typos? I took a picture but I cannot submit it. (On Relay)    Not at all. I prefer it that way. My friends tend to bicker and that is a constant buzz kill. I like to do them in my basement and watch Netflix. Unless I'm with my boyfriend. Then we just do stupid shit and fuck for hours.    So I get this. Especially on my bikini line. My pediatrician told me two weeks ago, to go to the dollar store, buy the Athletes foot cream, whatever one they have, and baby powder. Apply after a shower. First the cream, then the powder. After a few days it goes away. And mine was worse than this. It also surprisingly got rid of the dark spots. Now, I'm not an expert and everyone's bodies reacts differently to things- so it is merely a remedy. I cannot promise anything but I hope that maybe it helps!    EDIT: Make sure when you do apply these two easy steps, it is to dry skin. Try not to out on underwear right after. My suggestion would be after a shower before bed. Sleep commando.    MONKFISH   I am terrified of looking into the sky at any time of day/night.   Maleficent   Wait.........   I wouldn't punch you. Maybe just back hand ya. Or shake you. I can't decide. You look like my brother that's why....no hard feelings right?    Ohhhhh typical Temprance/Bedford behavior. Gotta love Michigan drivers. To people in Ohio, especially Toledo (bordered) Michigan drivers drive like someone lit them on fire. As ex dispatcher for NWO police majority of our accidents happen with Michigan drivers.  EDIT: I shouldn't say majority. But lots. Follow the traffic laws and all should be okay. Everyone rushes around here like traffic is that bad. Rush hour traffic in Toledo most you'd have to wait is an hour. Any where else- triple that.    Guilty.   Thank you! Lololll that is perfection   I need to meet these men.   I still think Jennifer Garner is a bitch for coming into the picture when he was with JLo. And I also still think that Afleck and JLo would be together to this day if it weren't for Garner. And we all know JLo is a ride or die kind of girl (Diddy shooting stint) so when it came to Aflecks friends (Kevin Smith) I doubt she would have objected to the friendship. She probably would have been the one handing him the Zippo for his smoke seshs anyways. Garner seems like an uptight bitch. Her little winced smile like the head of a dildo is going up her ass at all times. Idk there is something about Garner.... Something is off with her.    End rant about people I don't know and will never meet.   What happened?    My cottage in southern Ohio was build on an old Amish farm. Our lake was created by a damn, it is about 6 miles long. All the houses are in the bays of the lake. So anyways..  I was in bed one night and a little girl with long blonde hair in a white baptismal gown appeared at the foot of my bed. My younger cousin was in the room with me. When I saw her I tried to scream but no sound was coming from me. I could feel my chest getting tense. Anyways, this little girl said to me "SWIM!" after she said that she looked as if she was suffocating. I was totally spooked. Did some research and asked a few neighbors after that night if they had experienced anything. Apparently this little Amish girl drown in the lake right after the water had settled and she went from house to house warning people to not go in.   I embrace her now since she has such a sad story but truthfully....she still scared me a little.    I've always been pretty sensitive since I have been younger, honestly I know he is a good guy just territorial.   I have always been pretty lax around my house and others, always keep things clean but I have a bad habit of leaving doors and things open, in the past he has shut them right in front of me. He's territorial and doesn't like things messed up.   So I need to do a better job of respecting that. In the end I think he is just looking out.    So I'm house sitting again for my neighbors that I have previously posted about before. We did tell her father-in-law the day I arrived that I would be here and so far so good. A few subtle things like shutting doors, opening and shutting of drawers in the bed room. But nothing that has actually made me scared.  He was playing fetch with one of the dogs the other day. The dogs toy would move slowly around the room and the dog was chasing it. My mother actually witnessed this happening. She couldn't believe her eyes.   Glad he's getting to be more comfortable around me.    FRANK.   Can we see full with like a semi? I'm just so curious.    I slept with my best friends step dad when I was 20. He was in my college town for business. Always was attracted to him. He would always randomly hand us $100 in high school and on vacations and shit.  He was handsome, wealthy and I never really thought of him as her 'father/step father'. It happened and it was amazing. When she found out, she laughed. Said I wasn't the only one who had thought about it. But I was the only one to do it. She wasn't upset. Still isn't. We see one another weekly. I guess I got off easy. I still see him randomly, but I am in an amazing happy relationship.    EDIT: When I said "We see one another weekly." I mean my friend. Not him. I am in a great relationship.    Pink mist.    Reference: Grey's Anatomy   OMG THAT'S THE WORST! I'm so sorry that happened to you.    LONG LIVE TAYLOR SWIFT.          Was never a fan of hers until this album. CHEERS TAYLOR.   That's what I'm going to ask them to do. They leave in a few days and will be back in August will keep you posted!    From my understanding and the stories she and her husband have told me is that, he will turn on and off lights. When the kids are done playing in a room and forget to turn off a light, they would see them go off. Whenever any of their children wake up at night to use the restroom or get a glass of water, he will willingly turn on lights BEFORE they enter the room. Like he knows where they are going.   He has never truly harmed me, just scared me a few times. I wonder what I did wrong to him because from what I am told he was a nice man. Just didn't like change. I plan on staying the whole month- because it is a vacation to me being out of my parents house. I work so much (in a restaurant so strange hours) that I leave the dogs home all day and they like the company so of course I will sleep there.   I will just have to sit down and have a conversation with him. Let him know I mean no harm.    http://toghs.org/2008/05/03/ravine-park-cemetery/    I live in Sylvania, OH. What some people fail to mention about this cemetery is that it is in a neighborhood.  My friends and I would smoke weed out in the cemetery every once in a while. This day in particular, we hadn't smoked yet and we heard a woman weeping. We decided not to smoke and investigate instead.   About 30 minutes in we heard a woman weeping again. Then she asked "Where are they?!' We knew right then and there it was the woman looking for her husband's. We couldn't believe it. Needless to say we all ran like chickens. Couldn't believe what we had heard. It has been about 6 years and I can still hear the voice plain as day.    She has told me before that she always knew he was there but activity didn't start until they started making changes on the house. New floors, windows, ect. I don't mind that he is there, I just want him to be comfortable with me and my boyfriend.    They encourage me to have my boyfriend and certain friends over they don't mind at all! I've been house sitting for them for about 3 years now. I just feel as if he doesn't like me personally. I don't know. I want to sage the house but I would have to ask them before I did    So I house sit for my across the street neighbors once a month. Typically for a weekend sometimes a couple weeks. Great money. Watch the dogs and Ghost Adventures the whole time. Since my parents live across the street I feel safe. And since my neighbors have known me for so long I sometimes will have small get togethers with my friends or my significant other.  I have mentioned in other posts that I am somewhat sensitive. Normally things with spirits don't bother me much.    Anyways...her father-in-law passed away in the house about 15 years ago. These are bigger houses, and if you are down stairs the only way someone upstairs could hear you is if you are extremely loud. Like making a point for someone to hear you.  So my S/O was really pissing me off this night in particular. He said he was coming over but got trashed instead. I kept telling him to get a cab and come over since I was lonely and quite honestly just wanted to cuddle. That's when it all happened...   I was upstairs in the master bedroom watching television as I was falling asleep. About an hour after I fell asleep, I was sleeping on my right side, I felt someone push me onto my back and then pull the sheets off of the bed. I stayed as calm as possible. Went downstairs to let the dogs out and smoke a cigarette. When I got down there every light was on, the stove was on and the television was on. They have an amazing security system and I never worry about break ins. Plus my handy pistol is always by my side.   I turned everything off, smoked my cigarette, got the dogs in,  brushed my teeth and went back upstairs. About two hours later the same thing happened again. Pushed onto my back and the sheets were pulled off the bed.   This time I heard a very loud bang. Shook the walls a little. I flew out of bed. At this point I knew someone was in the house fucking with me. I thought it was my man being drunk and stumbling around. But being me I grabbed my pistol and checked every room upstairs and carefully made my way down stairs. No one was in the house. Every light was on. Every cabinet was open. Stove was on. Television was on. The dogs were hiding in the laundry room. I called my man and he said he was still out and that he would be over soon. I stayed up and waited for him.   When he arrived an hour later we went upstairs and laid down. He was holding me and all of a sudden his arm was yanked off. We both lost it. I have never been so terrified in my life. I called my neighbors and told them what happened. She told me to not worry about it that I was probably just her father-in-law. That he was never a fan of other people in his house and that I should talk to him and explain that I was there to take care of the animals and the house. Make sure everything was okay and safe while his son and daughter were out of town.    I go back next week for a month while they go to their other home in California. I'm absolutely terrified to go back.   How can I make this right with her late father-in-law?    Not yet lol  	31
 Would probably say it isn't a dystopia, though.   It hurts me to hear that. It really does.    Now, if it wasn't for *The Buried Giant* I wouldn't have read *Never Let Me Go*. But I didn't enjoy it as much.   Bad prose: E.L James, Stephanie Meyer, a fair portion of contemporary YA fiction.   Good prose: Most any classic, Stoner^^^1, McEwan, Never Let Me Go^^^2, The Kingkiller Chronicles^^^3.  (A lot of these are maybe somewhat opinion but I think in the most, they hold up)  1. By John Williams (Not the composer). *Read it!*  2. By Kazuo Ishiguro. *Read it!*  3. By Patrick Rothfuss. *Read it!*   The only book that's ever really done this for me was "The Virgin Suicides". Which was intense. I've heard really good things about All the Light We Cannot See, but I'm not sure about it.  When you've finished Never Let Me Go, let me know what you thought of it.   No. Because I do this at the end of a book. And At the end of a book, I'm almost always enraptured. So whilst I am quite excited for my next book, I wouldn't forego the ending of my current book for it.   Just looked over my bookshelf to "Catch-22", but maybe you're right. Perhaps I should read "Ready Player One" now instead. Or "Lolita"...   I'm trying to take my mind off the book and it isn't working. :(  I really want to see the film now. I was reading the book and could just absolutely see the actors as the characters. Garfield as Tommy was just too good, especially in my head.    Agreed. I still haven't seen the *Brotherhood* version though.   You thought that way about your furniture and your first thought wasn't to start a fight club?   *"the pleasure of a dream is that it was a fantasy, if it happens it was never a dream."*  Just wanted to discuss the quote and if you agree with it. Agree with it *to some extent*, or think it's baloney.  The quote is from *The Fullmetal Alchemist.*   Praise be to our lord and saviour, Neil Gaiman. Blessed be his name.   Very few books, if any, have ever made me feel quite like this. Definitely more rare, is that I have to take a while to digest a book. I don't think I'll be able to forget about this one for a while. One of the most heart-breakingly true and human books ever written.   Allow me to summarise my feelings:  #AAAAAARRGGHHH!   Does that animated sequence in Kill Bill count? 'Cause that was pretty amazing.   It has a good ending. I will give it that. A fair bit of a twist.   I find inspiration can last maybe 5k words. I think once I got it to 15k on a short. After that it's just sheer will-power to sit down and write.   For shorter shorts, and poetry though, I wouldn't write without a decent amount of initial inspiration.    The trick is to work without inspiration. Maybe doesn't work so well for poetry, though. I admit, you gotta be inspired for that. But for novel writing, inspiration is a useless dream.   No. You must suffer for cheating and learn from your mistakes. Paper Towns is a pretty excellent book, with a decent ending. You've ruined that now, nothing can be done. Just don't do it again!   Hey thanks for the feedback. It's good to know I'm not alone!  Why can't you read American Gods? It honestly is an amazing book. But if you're convinced to read Gaiman, The Ocean at the End of the Lane is simply amazing, too.   The Simpsons Movie.  I haven't heard anyone say anything but "it was naff on the first watch, but suddenly fucking amazing on the second and from then on."   Apology accepted. Otherwise, Neeson is a perfectly acceptable answer.   Missed the whole *actress* thing, didn't you?   I'm not sure it really matters. His books are all so good and so incomparable. Neverwhere. The Ocean at the End of the Lane. American Gods. The Graveyard Book. They're all excellent.   Superhero movie at 4.5.  Because nothing says perfection through imperfection like that piece of shit film that made me cry so many times.   Ah, I don't know why but Marvel release in England before America. But we still haven't gotten Inside Out yet, which sucks major balls.   What type of book. err, is hard to put down. It's I suppose horror, with touches of YA and fantasy. I struggle to define it. It's about malevolent spirits and how the two protagonists are affected at different times in their lives.   Male, 23 from England. I'm waiting for a phone call for the hours on my new job. Which sucks. So really I'm just writing my novel, seeing if my friend will wake up so we can go and see **Ant-Man!**   Yuh-uh. I just went on and it says it's open. Let me download it though I haven't tried playing it. But it does say it's good to go.   Once upon a time, there was a unicorn.   It's a composite. It's really just one picture. The video is just the best way of getting across what the picture is actually for. There might be a way to zoom in on bits and pieces on an actual website, but I find the video does the job well enough.  So, what is really wrong with it?   [This picture.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=udAL48P5NJU)   Yeah. I thought it was pretty obvious (with the new look) that it would be a different Joker origin. Nolan didn't quite go with canon anyway for Ledger. And then WB put a new spin on Leto's joker with an alternative origin.   They pretty much had to do that, though. So it wasn't so similar to Ledger/Nolan. And so it fit in with the comic-book arc.    Unicorns.  (The logic of this question dictates that 'not-existing' isn't a suitable answer).   Someone else as in, from a different origin?   I don't mind that they're doing something different with him. And I don't blame them for taking steps to differentiate between the last incarnation so recently after it. I just think they're more worried than they need to be. Comparisons are bound to be made, but, honestly, the films won't even be slightly similar.    Compared to some of the more recent trailers, it feels like SS and BvS have been very bare. I know SS is more of a teaser, so we'll have to wait and see on that one but so far so good.  The spray paint on Superman for felt like it was just putting the audience into the right point within the film - so we know how that film-universe feels about Superman. The God imagery did get a bit too much in Man of Steel, so I do hope they tone down in this one. Especially with all of the controversy about him.  My feelings with the Joker is that it's too conscientiously different from Ledger's. They've looked at how Nolan does it and then contrived to go in as far the opposite direction as possible.   Watched video.  Is now downloading game.  50% to test this for myself.   Man, I was like...10 when it came out.  But up until Fellowship there was huge scepticism that the books couldn't be turned into films. They simply couldn't be made. Obviously Jackson showed them.   I assume you've also seen the SS trailer?   Thoughts on Leto's Joker?   LOTR marathon.  That is all.   Isn't Aquaman in it too? Whoop!   I understand what you mean about Superman and his motives. But to me it looks like it really will be Batman attacking and Superman defending. Then, when humanity turns on him, he might just take it all out on Batman, who is kinda provoking him, and kick his ass.   I never really had a fault with Man of Steel. The whole reason to side against Zod was so as not to doom an entire race. That makes sense. So now that he's saved Earth, the humans turn on him, and Batman is at the forefront of that. That feels like Superman's motivations to me.  I'm just excited to see how it goes in with the Suicide Squad, and the Joker. Well, not just excited. Also excited.   I mean, yeah, war-out. But does it really matter who loves a thing more than you do? As long as you both love it and can talk passionately about it, who cares who claims to love it more?  But, more importantly, what *did* you think of the BvS trailer?   I am patriotically obliged to say Tea.  British problems.   I think McEwan's longer novels aren't as good as his shorter ones (except *The Children Act*). So I liked *The Cement Garden* and *On Chesil Beach* a fair bit more than *Atonement*. I think *Sweet Tooth* is the exception to that rule, because I quite liked that, a touch more than Atonement. I couldn't even finish *Solar*, but I might come back to that one now I'm a bit older.   Ok, I'll read Amsterdam last :)   Man, I didn't even pick up on that. Mind you when I finally finished Atonement I was pretty done with it. Yeah, I remember thinking that Tom having written it wasn't particularly special. I'm telling you, I don't think he'll be able to top 'On Chesil beach'. But I need to read Amsterdam, Saturday and Enduring Love before I commit to that.   Thanks, Ramona.   *On Chesil Beach*, by Ian McEwan   Thanks, Scott :)   (third week running :D)  Leave any fact you know or can think of off the top of your head. If you have to google it, you're cheating. GO!   I'm sorry I read this so long ago I cannot remember it. Remind me which bit. :(   Pronunciations:  Sock-i-fin  Or-rahg-fee  Pastor-ch-ku (very guttural)  Net-o-sky-er  zaa-s-fa  grr-tig-ish(sometimes concluded with "waa")  pas-rat-fu   They're only 12!   Mac's aren't difficult. But if you're only used to PC and come over, I understand there is an initial moment of sheer befuddlement.  (P.S - Word of the day: befuddlement.)    A rainbow beam fighting a volcanic eruption.   Awesome! (Y)   Ah, good good. The amount of people I've heard panic when they first see a Mac having only ever used Windows their entire life. It makes me giggle. (I was the first time I used a Mac).   For the love of GOD.   Have to admit though, controller responsiveness is one I've never heard of. Having both consoles, I've never had an issue with responsiveness on either. Ever.   Best way to decide is which console will have games with split screen support.  (Spoiler: it's neither the XB1 or PS4. It's the Wii U).   This is a really long Saturday. I got up to go to my little brother's party really early and got back so I'm just sat here, reading my book. You got a Mac? First time using an Apple PC?   So the OP can drown in the multitudinous millions of others who moved there solely with the dream to write, act, direct or sing?     I was in a relationship for five years. When we broke up she got all our friends, and I contacted an old friend from school. I met his girlfriend and we talked about books for the whole meal (we met over dinner).   We aren't really friends. But I wish I had someone I saw often who I could talk to about things that interest me.   Because more people have bought a PS4, so they charge more knowing they can get more money :)   Cinema 4DS or equivalent.  If you don't even know what the program is, then there's no way you're going to be able to start throwing out CGI like that. It isn't simple or easy.   As for pre-rendered ones. They might exist, but not cheap.   Major spoilers did.   [But if you're still interested](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIBSEBj6YhQ)   The opening to The Dark Knight Rises? Nolan genuinely ripped a plane apart and dangled it vertically from another. No CGI.   Get them classics in: 1984, Great Gatsby, Slaughterouse-5. All fantastic novels.  Otherwise I recommend anything on earth by Neil Gaiman :)  (Please note anything on earth is not a book. I'm just saying that anything with the name Nail Gaiman on, pick it up.)   It was sobs of both. Happiness I'd been able to get it done, and it was finished. And then sad because it was finished and I had killed off a main character and it was very sad :(   ...Drumming.  It's about drumming.  J.k Simmons is just amazing, it's just worth watching the entire film for his performance. I did just try and summarise it but I can't do the film justice, so look it up on IMDB, find a proper synopsis is my advice. But just watch it, honestly. It is simply amazing.   **Whiplash**  11ty-twelve out of five.   Make friends. The only way to survive menial jobs like fast-food is to have good people to look forward to spending your shift with.   I was using the example given by the OP. That's all.   Assuming you're ok with how much time that would take to edit a few completed manuscripts in one go. Real pain in the ass, editing is. I wouldn't want to do more than one novel at a time.   So many of these theories are pretty much accepted now, which is a bit of a shame. Auri is a namer. A powerful one. Meluan Lackless is Kvothe's aunt. All this stuff about the Chandrian, and Mr. Ash, and whether or not Denna is one of the Chandrian; there is some pretty good theories about all of these but I don't remember them.   Except in games like Mass Effect and Dragon Age 2, or any game where the protagonist has a flagship appearance that you probably shouldn't change.   I think pain and infection are your main concerns, so just check them. Otherwise, you have the blessing of at least one total stranger on the internet :)   I was born in the 90's and I wouldn't miss out on films from the 80's or before just because of it.    Ok, under foot isn't too bad. But if you go too deep you'll massively hurt yourself and might not be able to walk on it for a while.   You know how to work the gun?  And if you do do it, at least you know how to take care of it. I wouldn't skimp out on washing it thoroughly. Twice as thoroughly as any other tattoo you have.   Unless you're going to do this dot-by-dot, I don't imagine using the gun is as simple as it seems. Also sterilisation and care. Have you seen infected tattoos? Also, if you are heavily tattooed the last thing you want/need is some squiggly uneven black mark messing it up. Because - let's face it - you're not going to do a fantastic job :/   Depends on traditional or self-publishing.  Also, probably not worth trying to publish your first novel. That's the rule of thumb. Gotta get that practice in, and write a few more.   People like Anita S are barely journalists though. In the case of Anita S, she isn't even talking about games that could be described as even approaching journalistic. Reviewers, and magazines (both on and offline) entail journalism. You're suggesting imposing restrictions on people who don't need restrictions. People like Anita S (to use your example) are well known within the community. Any decent journalist the viewers would know to trust thanks to word of mouth, and would therefore not need these checks.    Whoa, you read *The Philosopher's Stone* and then skipped ahead to *The Deathly Hallows*? The films can't fill in that gap.   Your reaction to finish a book was so different to mine. I broke down into tears and just held my face for a little while, sobbing.    Look at the different areas of gaming and see which one you want to do most, which one you think you're best at. Modelling, concept art, texturing, programming, etc.  And then just learn it. There are plenty of free tools to learn how to use them, and just make something. If you get Unity the 'Tornado Twins' have a brilliant tutorial covering the entire basics for Unity.    Jump into the genre. The same way she made us wait for the midnight release of GTAV on PS3 and she literally never played it. Or TLOU, which she never played. Which didn't stop er buying the remaster.   Breaking into the industry isn't easy. And you might think with all of these indie games clawing for air every five seconds, you might find a place. But the thing is for every game there's another hundred guys trying to break into the industry. For every game another dozen never get finished.  Learn a skill, make yourself stand out. You have to do something. Programming. Art. A lot of indie studios take on writers now. Look into it. It's something you can do as a hobby on the side. Learn Unity or Unreal Engine. Practice making your own stuff. It's difficult. Hella difficult. I failed at it. But, hey, who said dreams ought to be easy?   No one. Even if you could bring together a team of dedicated devs guess who would be wholly obsolete? Guess who would get kicked out first.  Everyone has an idea. The industry doesn't need idea's people.  Sorry - I know that was harsh.   Are there are a lot of books about this? I never seem to find any  Are they just boring? Does no one like them? Have they been played out? I just think it's strange for a fairly large subject to see very little about it.   I've been listening to 'The Amy Trilogy' non-stop. Also 'I Still Believe', 'If Ever I Stray' and 'Get Better'. And others but eh...   Frank Turner.  My friend put it on when we were driving back after a weekend away. That was three weeks ago, haven't stopped listening to him since.   As long as they're not BNP or ridicuously UKIP, I don't care.   Ni No Kuni. That was amazing. And so were the graphics. That game was absolutely eschewing for GOTY and then TLOU came out damnit.    Instant win for band name.   Hey, I just wanna come back to something.  *What the holy fuck is Library Science?*   I'd like to see him do a space movie. Like A Space Odyssey. I think that would be a good watch.   Not me, but my girlfriend, bought the Watchdogs collectors edition. Boy did she regret that.   All right, I don't wanna write a novel.   In just the SS trailer saw origin for Harley Quinn, Enchantress and Deadshot. Maybe for Joker as well. Just makes me think what the SS movies are going to be. Because whatever happens they're gunna shoehorn all these movies together.   The thing about DC is that it absolutely feels like their shoe-horning characters together to compete with The Avengers. That might not be the case. But a film with introducing a new Batman, Wonder-Woman and Aquaman might be a bit much.  As for the suicide squad...the entire trailer felt like just a frame to introduce The Joker at the end. There was nothing else to it. A few character snaps and then Leto. And my concern for Leto's Joker is that it's possibly going to be based mainly on ensuring that it isn't like Ledger's uber-succesful one. This isn't a criticism of the film, just that trailer. There's also no way that we can see as much of the characters SS as we would want to. So some are going to get left behind.  And I like that DC are being more gritty. I love the MCU but I'm really dying to see something else.   Nostalgic re-read.   She growled, "I hate you."  Period before the speech mark.   *noise of a plane going down, going down. Crashing. -Explosion-*   Read the first chapter and run-on sentence is right.  The man wakes alert for something had woken him, he looks over to his wife in the bed beside him and sees her missing he grabs the knife from under his pillow and looks around his room.  The man wakes. Alert. Something had woken him. He looks over to the empty space beside him and sees his wife his missing. He grabs the knife from under his pillow and looks around his room.  Real-long sentence. Also, he looks over to his wife, who isn't there, so he can't look over to his wife.   Rule of thumb is to not show your work to anyone until it's 100% finished. If not finished, then 200% polished.   City of God. Because I need at least 24 hours to psyche myself up for it, and mentally prepare myself, and I never seem to have the time.    I love this. What a weird thing to fear, something you'd never expect to happen. It's just funny because a few years ago this would have been impossible.    That's great to hear thanks. Don't have to go and change my entire 100k word novel now. Phew.   That makes sense, it's just that I've seen it used both ways. For example the book I'm reading now, by an English author, uses 'these.' But another English book I have uses "these". Why are there no laws!   "Goddamnit," he cursed. Well, at least my first novel is right then.   Tarantino  Nolan  Coppola  Anderson  Von Trier  As a film graduate myself, being familiar with any director's body of work, and being able to reference it, is a massive help.      When you write speech, do you put "" or ''  So  "Hi," she said.  Or  'Hi,' he said.  This is stupid. And, having written an entire novel, I really should know this. I do not. Does it matter?   Just finished Lullaby, by Palahniuk.   Now reading; Ptolemy's Gate, by Jonathan Stroud.   This is a pretty neat book. I read it a few months ago, not long after it's release. I quite enjoyed it. Was different to anything I had ever read.   **Ptolemy's Gate, by Jonathan Stroud**   Well EA was just the example given to me. But of course the studios they buy out, yeah, they screw over.   Yes, this one is Bethesda. Don't you worry.   You know who Bethesda are right?   Hello again bunnywhispers :)   I think EA actually develop and publish games themselves. They do everything. I think. Obviously that doesn't say a lot for the team who make the game but still...   Just have to say, the gaming studios aren't the blame. It's the publishers. Never (rarely) blame the publishers, they want to make the best game they can. It's their publishers who are to blame.   Holy crap that's a convoluted title.   Well she answered. So she didn't seem to mind. Obviously *she*, and it was *her* sex life, didn't seem to mind the question.   I just use Open Office. I just sit at my desk every day and pump out words. I don't use GDocs or Dropbox because I like to keep everything on my laptop (I have back-ups). Writing on my phone, or anything that wasn't a PC doesn't appeal to me in the least.  	119
 Yeah. If there is any justice in this cruel world, they'll get relegated to League One this season and we'll never hear from them again.    YOU CAN'T STUMP THE TRUMP!

Nah, not at all.   [McVeigh](https://imgur.com/OXqfpoJ)  Dylann Roof may very well have been mentally disturbed but the media have chosen to ignore that angle and have completely chosen to ignore how his attack was a planned murder-suicide and not just a murderous massacre. He ran out of bullets and didn't manage to kill himself after he killed his victims. The media wants him to look as bad as possible so they'll call him a terrorist like they want to and ignore any other possible motive for his killing such as mental health related to suicide and depression.   http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/dylann-roof-wanted-massacre-suicide-victim-son-article-1.2266039  http://www.latimes.com/nation/nationnow/la-na-dylann-roof-suicide-attempt-20150620-story.html  http://www.infowars.com/charleston-shooter-was-on-drug-linked-to-violent-outbursts/  http://www.wnd.com/2015/06/big-list-of-drug-induced-killers/     It wasn't until three days later he realised what he'd done.

I did a fair bit of masturbating when I was a little younger. I, uh -- I used to call it "stroking the salami." Yeah, you know, "pounding the ol' pud." I never did it with baked goods. But you know your Uncle Mort? He "pinched the one-eyed snake" five, six times a day. See, it's like, uh, practice for the big game. You see?

Hope Solo literally stands front and center on my screen right now with an interviewer gushing about her and her teammates and it's alright because she can beat people up not get into trouble for it with our biased media.   Hilarious stuff.    Can someone tell me why she gets as much attention and publicity as she does? I'm not an MMA fan at all but I just saw her do this on TV and I've seen her on TV a lot over the last year and I'm not sure why she is so well-known. I know very little about MMA other than it apparently has become a fairly popular sport in the last couple of years. However, I don't think that women's MMA is popular at all yet I would wager that more Americans know who Rhonda Rousey is than they do other well-known male MMA fighters. Can someone in this sub explain her apparent popularity to me or why the mainstream media and sports media seem to pay attention to her so much? Serious question and not rhetorical or trolling in any way.   Edit: You people are pretty weird. I explicitly state I'm not trolling and just asking an honest question to try and understand something and you downvote me. OK..   Aaaand forwarded to HR. Definitely not something to just forget about in my opinion.    Yea I was a bit skeptical of this as well while reading that exchange. I don't think this is the first time that subreddit has been messed with or trolled in a sort of way.     If Steve announces they're banning hate subs, this place is going to explode.  No, it won't. They'll ban CoonTown, maybe WhiteRights, probably not TheRedPill, and maybe some other shock value and seedy subs like rapingwomen and CandidFashionPolice. Reddit will kick up a bit of a storm but not much at all, far less of a tantrum than the one that we saw during the banning of FatPeopleHate. Life will then proceed as normal a week after the purge and redditors will continue to visit the site because they really don't care about those subs being banned. FPH was a sub that had the power of reaching /r/all every day and it was honestly a force to be reckoned with because it had so much activity and so many subscribers. None of the subs that Huffman is going to ban really have much of a base that had the power of FPH in voting and gaining visibility.     So some people on the jury did feel that her case had some validity.  It was literally 1 woman whose objectivity as a juror was questionable. She was very emotional when all of the other jurors disagreed with her view that Ellen was the victim of discrimination.    Without knowing anything, "you" assume she was unjustly let go.  I never once mentioned the firing/resignation of Victoria.    if a ceo posted a blog with racial slurs, the same type of people why wanted Pao gone for things she said, would defend the racist Ceo.  You don't really have much evidence or proof of this anywhere, especially here on reddit, and I would wager that if this CEO was in charge of a corporation or entity in which their racial views could affect their decision-making or running of their entity then the patrons or employees of said entity could rightly take issue with them.     The "but reddit's a private website and you have no guarantee of free speech" argument trotted out by people like you has never been a great argument since the argument doesn't extend beyond the notion of the admins saying "because I said so" when asked why they don't allow certain subreddits. At least try not to be lazy and employ some of the historical arguments made in the past for freedom of speech and what not. Better to say and elaborate deeply on why free speech shouldn't be allowed on a privately owned website instead of just saying "Cuz it's my website brah and I do what I want!" to anyone who questions the limiting of free speech on reddit.    hate speech  Hate speech is in the eye of the beholder and in this case it could have been in Ellen Pao's eyes or in the eyes of Huffman and Alexis. Know what? After how I've seen these people behave over the years and over the past year, I really don't want them making moral judgments on what should and shouldn't be allowed here and on what constitutes hate speech. For some people, /r/MensRights is a hate group akin to a neo-Nazi group or forum while other people think that it's just a group dedicated to addressing the issues of men in an ever-changing society in which they are feeling threatened, troubled, and or confused about their roles as males among other things.   This is why you don't let people regulate hate speech because then you get differing views on what exactly it is and the Potter Stewart position of "I know it when I see it" doesn't always fly with people like myself who don't want a sole individual's pair of eyes making judgments for the rest of us.   	59
 I asked Harvey Smith about Corvo's personality, here's what he said:   "the kind of man who loves only once. passionate, but private. guarded, analytical, equally prone to long periods of study and caution, and quick outbreaks of creative violence..."  I also asked him what he and the Empress did in there spare time, together.   "smoke a pipe, play small stringed instruments, climb and swim, cook over an open fire, take small boats out sailing"  [Harvey Smith's Twitter](https://twitter.com/Harvey1966/with_replies)         What does is say about Corvo?   Just reading that was intense.   La Seydoux is crazy attractive.      yes   Silver Linings Playbooks. Watch it, watch it, watch it, watch it and watch it.  Grand Budapest Hotel.   Chef   Just want to know if the Dunwall Archives Dishonored book is really worth getting. I'm a hardcore fan of the game, has anyone got it? What's it like?   Wow. I never find all the money. I usually miss out on 1-2 grand.   Yeah I asked him.  I also asked him about Corvo's personality as well. He said he's passionate but private, guarded, analytical equally prone to long periods of caution and study. The kind of man who loves only once. I also asked him what he and the Empress did in their spare time, just look on his replies. I am NathanLabesius as well as DamienLee. I made two accounts so he wouldn't get sick of one user asking him questions all the time.   His twitter is like a constant AMA.    The Sixth Sense and Fight Club.      Nostalgia trip/10.   With narration and mostly handheld camera shots from Emmanuel Lubezki.   But Craig is still signed on for one more Bond after Spectre, I'm pretty sure, so who should direct Craig's last Bond?   November, december maybe   I agree. He was pretty much just used for like 2 scenes in DOFP. I hope that doesn't become a thing.   You should probably spoiler-tag that shit up   Look how old Emily is.    Glad to hear. That scene from Days of Future Past was nothing short of brilliant. He's a better quicksilver than Aaron Taylor Johnson from Age of Ultron, IMO, but he was still pretty good.   American Beauty.  In a good way.      You don't have to download it, it's simply an audio thing, you just have to press play.   Made a separate account just so I could ask some more questions, got some good stuff about D2 out of him: https://twitter.com/DamienLee1358/status/622440300485611520     One of the best memes I've seen in a while.   I think you just answered the question.      Not confirmed. This is just speculation. However with a new plague in D2 there will most likely be new type of weepers, 'Howlers' maybe.   What does SFM stand for?      Billie Lurk   Thomas.   Yes   What your asking is for Pixar to introduce completely new characters. That might not fit well with most kids.   I think Warcraft is going to be fantastic. I mean, this is they guy who wrote and directed 'Moon' as well as directing 'Source Code'. I have no doubt that this guy knows what he's doing.

The Revenant (for me) is a must watch  Sicario. Denis Villenueve's new film. Along with Deakins shooting, you can't go wrong.  Star Wars. Duh.  Hateful Eight. Tarantino's new movie gotta see it.   Steve Jobs. Bound to win some oscars.  Spectre. Skyfall was fucking spectacular, hope this tops it.  Ant-Man. I'll give it a shot.  Southpaw. Love Jake Gyllenhaal.  MI5: Rogue Nation. Looks awesome, loved the 4th one.  I've probably missed heaps but those are my main ones.   All the while he was still acting.   He probably will lose to some pretentious garbage piece of shit performance.   Guards also say Blow off choffer as well.         https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UnsDyv-TtJg  Just before we see the body with insects coming out of his guts, on the wall it says 'Howlers come at night'. Because of this new plague that'll be in the game, I think these 'Howlers' will be a new type of weeper.   Also, those new tallaboy robot guard things look like they have eyes on their lower back. That'll make for an interesting challenge. I could be wrong though.   I doubt it.      I've waiting for this since day fucking one. Lubezki's cinematography looks fantastic, as does DiCaprio of course. This'll be winning some major Oscars.  Loving the beautiful wide shots.   This deserves a remake.   Still won't be as good as if Fukunaga directed it. This'll most likely end up being PG-13, which fucking sucks, as the book is purely meant for adults.

Will there be some Corvo/masked felon legacy? That's exciting.    Harvey Smith said a while back that Corvo canonically spared Daud. However you're better off asking him on his twitter account. Don't ask too much though, make the question as simple as possible. He replies sometimes if your question in simple enough.      You need more gold.   Gal Gadot is crazy attractive.

I haven't seen the Master in a while but I thought It had a 1:85:1 aspect ratio?   A while ago it was announced that Ryan Gosling is set to start, Denis Villenueve is set to direct and Roger Deakins is set to shoot the film. I guess you already know that Harrison Ford is returning.   LOVED Silver Linings Playbook and American Hustle. I hope this tops both. Cooper in a supporting role though?          I intend to take influence from the world of Dishonored, if you don't know what that is, it's a video game set in the fictional city of Dunwall in the Isles. You can read more about it [here](http://dishonored.wikia.com/wiki/Dishonored).  How do I go about creating an entirely new world from scratch? I just need a starting point.    Just looking for movies like Spielberg's 'Munich'. Political thrillers that revolve around assassination and spies.    I need to watch A Bittersweet life and Memories of Murder. Which should I watch first?   **5. Slaves With White Collars  How Advertising Affects Us**  Fight Club is one of those films thats layered like the proverbial onion, except instead of making you cry, it makes you think. One of the major provoking themes of the film is the desensitisation of a generation to our ancestral instincts  like gathering life-supporting resources and continuing our genetic line  and the replacement of these instincts with material and commercial items. Or in other words, working jobs we hate, so we can buy shit we dont need. Both the book and film focus heavily on this, and in fact director David Fincher is quoted as saying that every scene of the film contains a Starbucks coffee cup. Essentially it points out how our hardwired needs are being exploited and replaced. Instead of having a bigger food pile than our fellow caveman, now we want the most expensive car, the swankier apartment and the designer clothes. A key part of our evolution is mate selection, and much of this relies on cues of fitness. A landmark study by Buss (1989) suggests that males value reproductive capacity (waist to hip ratio, healthy hair, skin, youth etc) and females value resource acquisition (physically healthy and strong, wealth etc). The reason for this, of course, is that at the basic level the meaning of life is to reproduce and ensure the survival of ones offspring. If a partner is good-looking, this is a sign he/she is healthy and is more likely to be able to foster strong children. If a partner is wealthy there is more chance they can acquire greater resources and ensure the prosperity of the family. Advertisers know that all this happens at a subconscious level, and they tap into it at will. How often do you see an advert for a perfume or aftershave featuring someone clinically obese, sitting in their clapped out Ford Fiesta telling you how good it smells? Never. Its always the young model with a Gucci dress or an Omega watch getting out of a Aston Martin, or pondering life upon some L A rooftop (whilst not mentioning what the hell it smells of), because thats what hits our evolutionary buttons and makes us want to have that life. The item for sale in half the adverts is irrelevant, its the lifestyle they are advertising. Yet as cynical as we are, we all know this is a fairy tale. We know that if you buy that car youre not going to become a film star, but we do it anyway. Its this point Fight Club taps into so well, that the greatest trick the advertisers play is letting us think that we came up with the whole idea ourselves, and then making us pay for it.  **4. Youre Not A Beautiful And Unique Snowflake  You Have To Work For Something Meaningful**  Most of us felt it at some point, that we were somewhat special, that we could be just like the people in the music videos, the movies and the television shows. A simple flick through Saturday night prime time TV can show you how much everything is geared towards that flicker of fame, that taste of perceived success. When members of the public are giving hand jobs to farm yard animals (Rebecca Loos  The Farm) or masturbating with wine bottles live on tv for your viewing pleasure (Kinga Karolczak  UK Big Brother 6) you know something somewhere is wrong. As Tyler Durden says weve all been raised by television to believe that one day wed all be millionaires and movie gods and rock stars, but we wont and were slowly learning that fact.. and were very very pissed off. This is a point thats touched on a little more in the book than the film. In the book the narrator (Edward Nortons character) meets Tyler on a nude beach, where he watches him drag and place logs so that the shadow they cast looks like a giant hand, with Tyler sitting in the middle of the palm. With the changing position of the sun for one moment the hand is perfect. Tyler says that a person has to work hard for it, but one minute of perfection was worth the effort. That a moment was the most you could ever expect from perfection. If we look at psychologist Abraham Maslows model, known as Maslows Hierarchy Of Needs, right at the top of the pyramid, what Maslow argues is the pinnacle of existence is self actualisation. As he writes in his 1954 paper, what a man can be, he must be. For the narrator, that is what Tyler represents, perfection. For a moment in time he is all he can be. Now admittedly this meeting is far more symbolic in the book than the film, and I wouldnt necessarily say the books meeting is better. But what it shows is to achieve something meaningful to you, you have to work at it. Now Im not advising you start an underground cult and try to revert our civilisation back to year zero, but you know, maybe write something?  **3. Youre Not Your Fucking Khakis  We Are Not Defined By Our Possessions**  The line the things you used to own, now they own you is possibly one of my favourite in both the book and the film. It may be a very 60s vibe but the concept that we as consumers are more concerned with our possessions than our personalities strikes a particular cord. Think of the grandmother, religiously polishing the family silver they never use. I mean when was the last time you bought clothes purely for their physiological properties? If that were the case, rather than squeezing into an uncomfortable suit, we would all wear our pyjamas everywhere. Ok, I know many a student has taken a trip to the local supermarket in their Hello Kitty finest, but really, would you go to a job interview like that? Oh this, yeah, Spider-Man, whats the pension scheme like? We buy cars and houses and before long we are working just to pay for our possessions. Then before you know it you wake up at 70 and youre retiring, wondering why you only have 10 years left (if youre lucky) to try and enjoy these nice things youve worked for. Fight Club bases much of the apathy felt by the narrator on his relationship with his Ikea nest, defining himself by his hand crafted dishes and his Strinne green striped armchairs. But it was when he lost it all that he truly felt delivered. In his book, The Philosophy Of Ownership, Robert LeFevre talks of the history of the idea that an individuals virtue relies on not owning multiple possessions. In Platos Republic, the philosopher Socrates proposes a city in which there is no private property, with its citizens sharing everything. LeFevre also notes that Buddhism and Christianity also emphasise that possessions are a burden to achieving enlightenment. Simply put nice things are, well, nice, but they shouldnt encompass who you are.  **2. Its Only After Weve Lost Everything That Were Free To Do Anything  Post-Traumatic Growth**  Although this one might be pretty hard to understand unless youve encountered a life-altering situation, the philosophy is sound. The idea that losing all hope is freedom can be seen in how attitudes and mind-sets change following a trauma. In the psychology world, (please take notes class) this is known as post traumatic growth. For example, a 2009 study by Crystal Park (and others) in the Journal of General and Internal Medicine found that 83% of cancer survivors reported a more positive identity. Two of the leading writers on post-traumatic growth, Tedeschi   Calhoun note how often the attempt to understand human suffering appears in literary works, and therefore as a result in film. In Fight Club trauma and personal growth isnt a result, its the goal. In the book, the narrator says At the time, my life just seemed too complete, and maybe we have to break everything to make something better of ourselves. The narrator creates Tyler to help him change his boring and unfulfilled life, and the only way he could see this creation was through self-destruction. The difficulty in learning from this philosophy lies in the ability to grasp this new appreciation of the world without having to, you know, nearly die. But the answer could lie with being able to understand the everyday trauma around us. Harness the appreciation and understanding that even if we are not happy with our lives, we are lucky enough to have the chance to change it.  **1. The Ability To Let That Which Does Not Matter, Truly Slide  Dont Sweat The Little Things**  Ok, so were all guilty of this one. No-one can ever really say that nothing gets to them. And sure, its ok to shit yourself when your house is on fire, or you get into a car accident. But whether or not your T-shirt goes with that pair of jeans, or if youre getting too many wrinkles? None of this REALLY matters. In the grand scheme of things, when youre on your death bed, and they ask you what do you regret, no-one is going to say I wish I had chosen the blue sofa instead of the green. Worry, in an evolutionary perspective, is a good thing. For example, its good to worry about looking as you cross the road, because if you dont youre likely to get hit by a car. However ,excessive worrying  dubbed by psychiatrist Edward Hallowell as toxic worry  mainly focuses on the what if rather than the what is. In an excessive form this kind of worry can sometimes be classed as generalised anxiety disorder, where the worry is disproportionate to the actual problem. Its this kind of worry and stress that actually makes solving the problem harder, because the brain cant focus on the solution. Its a case of not being able to see the wood for the trees, and if you spend all your energy on worrying about the problem, you cant work out the solution. In Fight Club the narrator says After a night in fight club, everything in the real world gets the volume turned down. Having gone through a fight (something that would get most peoples attention) the things the narrator used to irrationally worry about, didnt seem as important any more. He realised that most stress and worry is a self created state, and by having something real to contrast it with, hes able to let the rest slide.   So there you have it, 5 philosophies neatly extracted from Fight Club. How does the story make you feel and what did you take away from it? Post your comments below, and remember, in Tyler we trust  I totally just broke the 1st and 2nd rules. Is the right sub to post this to?   Is the Lone Ranger any good? I've heard some good and some bad about it and I just want /r/movies' opinion on the film, should I watch it?      What is that from? Please tell.      I actually think they're hilarious.      Nice catch OP. Looks like they didn't want to give away what that green thing is until the last trailer.       This went through development hell apparently. Let's hope it turns out well.   Birdman      I really think he does not get enough recognition for how much of a talented actor he is. Ever since I saw him in 'Drive' (2011) I thought to myself that his career is going places. And now look, he's starring in one of the biggest upcoming films of all time, Star Wars The Force Awakens, and he's also starring in one of the biggest blockbusters of next year, X-men: Apocalypse. But what I like the most is how he's still doing smaller films as well. Just this year he stared in 'A Most Violent Year' along with Jessica Chastain and just recently he was in 'Ex Machina' (which I just saw) which as already made a spot in my top 10 of 2015. He's also set to star in a HBO Miniseries, 'Show me a hero'. Obviously when Star Wars and X-Men come out he'll receive a lot more attention and recognition from people but, IMO, up until this point I think he's quite an under appreciated actor. What do you guys think of him? What's your favorite of his?      Being an Aussie and can say that Jai Courtney's accent is spot on.   It.    IT and The Stand. His two best.    /r/imgoingtohellforthis   Why was Batman fighting soldiers with Superman symbols on their arms while in a desert while a weird (but still cool) bat suit?   For me, the story of Dishonored starts and ends with Corvo Attano. I need to get my head around this guy. It's his story, so I'll playing as Emily in my second playthrough, and Corvo on my first.   I know I fucked it.   Is Soloman Kane worth it?   The IT remake. Will Poulter would've made a great Pennywise.         This new trailer gives me hope for the DCCU. I watched a leaked version of the Suicide Squad trailer and that doesn't look too bad either. Also, I have faith in Snyder to make a solid Justice League movie(s), he proved he can handle an ensemble cast of characters well in Watchmen, IMO.   What the fuck even is Ant-Man?   Always love Bryan Singer's movies, he's a little underrated IMO.   I thought Superman burns his hair off? That's guaranteed brain cancer right there.    What does he mean by that?   Some people find him underrated, some people find him overrated. What are your thoughts of the guy as an actor? What's your favorite of his?   The books have been sitting on my shelf for years now. I think it's about time I get them out, blow the dust off and start reading.   The ending of One Flew over the Cuckoos nest. The music, the acting.  did NOT see it coming.  Also the ending to Zodiac left me with an emotion I didn't know I even had. It made me feel eerie and a little dirty inside. The victim pointing out that he is absolutely sure that that man was the Zodiac killer was just such a powerful scene followed that song and the aftermath of the case.      This looks fucking groovy as hell.   I'm loving the practical effects.   I'm loving all the practical effects.   [Here's some more footage of the bobbit worm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpD8jWvYEHI)   I should fucking kill you, /u/IAMNOTACANOPENER.   Someone needs to post the ending to 'Dr Zhivago'. Nothing short of amazing. He was one of Hollywood's golden actors, may he rest in peace.   Rest in peace Mr Sharif.    Imagine sticking your finger across it.   I enjoyed it.   It's considered the weakest of the trilogy for sure but it's not hated. I like it.   Please sabotage other movies.   I am a HUGE Pink Floyd fan, and I can't believe I haven't heard of this.     Not such a good choice in my opinion. Although Jurassic World wasn't perfect, I think the flaws came from the story and writing rather than the directing however I don't think Trevorrow is experienced enough (just judging from his [filmography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colin_Trevorrow) here) to direct a Star Wars film, let alone the the last of the new trilogy. I am very confident that Abrams and Johnson will do a solid if not excellent job directing Episodes 7   8, and I think having Trevorrow direct Episode 9 could result in a bit of a disappointment. But who knows, I could be wrong.          Waters? Barrett? Who?   And Aaron Eckhart KEPT ACTING!!!!!   You may want to remove this, before [they](https://www.reddit.com/r/moviescirclejerk/) see it.   The Last of Us has the most cinematic cut scenes I've ever seen.      Love how they are keeping faithful to Miller's The Dark Knight Returns. I love how it's worn and scratched, like he's been using it for a while. But does anyone know if Batman has ever used the armored suit other than [TDKR spoilers](#s "beating Superman within an inch of his life?")      I am pleasantly surprised. I was one of the guys who thought this was going to be Marvel's first MAJOR fuck up. Maybe not then.   [Hold out your hand, OP.](http://i.imgur.com/yAalTE9.gif)   For example, if you are crying, a dog will most likely come up to you and start licking your face or perhaps do something to comfort you. Or if you are angry at your dog he will perhaps curl up into a ball and look up at his master with shameful eyes. Can someone please explain in depth why dogs can pick that sort of thing up from humans? Thanks.  edit: *Why can dogs, not how. My bad.   Was waiting to see if someone would post this. Thank you, that is one of my favorite songs.      I like to say "not if you want to keep your spleen" from American Psycho.  I'm a cold bastard I know.   Didn't even know this was happening. I'm a huge SK fan I have the book but I am yet to read it.   Good on them.      Bring me that sequel.            Aussie here, you're damn right.   This reminds me of 'Ed Wood'. If you haven't seen it, watch it. It's about the worst film director of all time. Johnny Depp plays Ed Wood and Martin Landau plays Bela Lugosi, he won an oscar for it. Also, it's directed by Tim Burton. Great movie.   Goodfellas, Taxi Driver, Raging Bull, Gangs of New York, Casino, Shutter Island, The Aviator.  	140
    Who gives a fuck about an Oxford comma?   Obama was far from a front runner in 2008. The right discourse and enough momentum can make new front runners.   I got a Breton Motif. 4k gold.  Anyone interested pm me, ps4-NA   It is the Supreme Court's responsibility to protect minority rights from legislation which oppresses said rights. They now set precedent to avoid anymore legislation which would infringe on gay rights. This is exactly where this should have been decided. Just like it was the right place to resolve segregation and the infringement of African American rights. That is the whole purpose of Judicial Review. To prevent oppressive legislation by the majority. Good job SCOTUS!   I live in Wisconsin and happen to be a Vikings fan. Like to know the discourse of my rivals. Specifically when everyone near me is a Packer fan. Gonna be talked about all around me. Might as well be up to date.   Not saying the Vikings had a solid defense in that game. But an offense without Peterson and with Ponder sucks. It's inefficient (time of possession) and has turnovers. That makes success for the defense incredibly difficult.       It failed? That's funny. It sure didn't seem like it failed with groups of  9th graders singing this "obsolete" song throughout the day. But hell, you must have been there, not me. Since you seem so positive it failed.      Yikes. That is a whole lot of broad generalization about a whole country of people from one ignorant comment.  That certainly can't enhance any sort of conversation.    I listen using the Podcast Addict ap on my phone.  Super reliable and easy. Tons and tons of podcasts   Yeah.  I thought I remember him saying in part V that he was going to do one on the Peloponnesian War.  Obviously didn't say it would be next, but did mention he wants to do it.   Sproles is much older and certainly did not look better than Shady last year. That Shefter tweet about McCoy being 2nd in NFL in rushing behind Demarco weeks 5-17 last year proves that. He had a slow start, but is still a dominant back.  With that said, I still think the Eagles are the winners by being able to shed that cap hit and getting a potential stud in Alonso.   These are all over actually. Around both Madison as well as Milwaukee.   /s?   Adult chicken pox      I'll live with the post karma trumping my comment karma in this case. People disagree with me. I can live with that   Are you implying he shouldn't have been charged with a crime? Pretty sure that selling a fake illegal substance is illegal in every state. And if you are dumb enough to try and sell pop tarts as crack you should go to idiot jail anyway.  Edit: Really can't believe this comment is getting this much hate. The guy broke a law and was arrested. Pretty much all I said.       178, 2 and 1, and 52  	22
    Dude, he said he wasn't racist.   So you're telling me there's a chance?      Woo I'm special. 268 to 175 (5'-11.75" male) between January 2013 and today. Was at 180 a year ago, been maintaining for a while.   You're a fact over fiction person yet you are sitting here telling us a story about how you are convinced something you saw was evil without any facts to back it up. It sounds to me like you're turning your personal fiction into personal fact.       If I was the boss I wouldn't just walk away. I'd be a boss and tear them a new asshole.    Going to minimum security white color prison for insider trading is not hardcore. She taught art classes to fellow inmates.    He's an anti-vaxer, or at least vocally supports his wife on the issue.    Implying buying furniture that looks good, fits with your apartment wa, is arranged neatly and is kept clean doesn't take effort? They're all parts of a whole. Maintaining a space you can be comfortable in, and confident others will be comfortable in, requires effort on all fronts. A clean bathroom with an imbalance of messy living area will be off-putting; similarly, a nice living room with a dirty bathroom, kitchen, etc., will be off-putting.   Do you need someone who can potentially prescribe medication or would a LCWS work?   Show almost lost me with the opening sequence. Found his belching almost unbearable.    It's funny because I almost turned it off during the opening sequence due to Rick's uncontrollable belching. So glad I didn't, I knew it was going to be one of my favorites when Rick says, "it was a figure of speech Morty. They're bureaucrats, I don't respect them."   Taken ~2 hours apart.   Hit up Double Trouble. It's right by the Ensemble/HCC stop.    All the people aren't in North Texas though. Dallas/FW only has ~500,000 more people than Houston, and outside of those cities, North Texas is pretty sparsely populated.   But I guess, good job on having a marginally higher population than the second most populated metro area in your state, I guess?  PS Houston has more people than Dallas.  pps http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_counties_in_Texas  sort by population descending, majority of the top 10 counties are not in north texas, including #1.   context   no but if the post title was "Standing ovation from OA crowd as Harden walks off floor. #classyfans", I would use my brain to complete the context and not have this issue that you are seemingly having.   Since context?   lololol!!! :D   What did you say you little bitch? I have half a mind to make it my life's mission eat you with BBQ sauce, over and over, forever.   Ball chinned  monkey fellatier   So is playing defense so you don't put yourself into a position where you have to exploit the system to work your way back into the game.    It was humbling. I think I came out of the whole thing a better man    Just gotta have a short memory about it and start the steak anew.    That's funny cuz I pissed myself for the first time in 20+ years this weekend. Lol.    Rockets aren't even gonna show up, that's how fucked they are.    We'll get over it. At least we still have other fans making predictions about us :p   also, is your name a play off the way that congressman from Brooklyn pronounced Houston when he was talking shit about how we were complaining we didn't get one of the space shuttles?   sorry, Austin.   there is a lit mustard yellow and lit ketchup red zippo. see middle right, under 'believe it again'.  next iteration will have pyrotechnics and human sacrifice, no worries.   they're both large   Austin Rivers played like Austin Rivers thinks Austin Rivers plays.   It's not coming down.   I have two. The shirt on the right that says "don't tell me this town aint got no heart" is the back.  They don't fit me anymore, would you like one?   haha.      Whatever you did last time, keep doing it ;)   a fucking great one   I never said it was just don't act like you fucking know beyond a shadow of a doubt that McHale was never on the hot seat you dork.   but that doesn't mean you can stop doing it   lol   jesus dude, stop acting like you know the inner dealings of the houston rocket's internal organization.   I mean, don't act like it would have been out of the question. Anything is possible these days with the way NBA front offices act. Definitely don't disagree with the stuff after your first sentence, but I mean, c'mon, you're not like, super privy to 'the situation' compared to the rest of us.  Make me a list previously fired coaches whom "had great relationships with the FO" and "were respected around the league" and I'll give you a list of examples of why I'm right.   dawg you're like steph curry shootin airball in game 3. i'm sure you mvp, but sometimes you gotta admit you fuckin whiffed.    welcome to me after every rockets loss. "on second thought, /r/nba seems like a silly place"   yeah what a dick, kind of.   Barristan dying means Daario is taking over his role, while Wormtongue and Mellisande are taking over the love angle. Dany hasn't shown much love interest towards DarDar this season, has she? Maybe I missed it in all the non-sequiturs.    right the narrative fits after game 5. after game 6 they're not staying alive, they're in control.    I get that they had to win game 6 to stay alive. Winning game 6 resets the narrative though, right?   Like, after the Battle of Kursk, were the radios going like "***beep beep beep*** - soviets avoid destruction ***beep boop*** absolutely cripple german offensive capabilities, ***beep borp*** soviet union hangs but by a pulse."?   huge run in the rockets favor?   not sure it counts but i called Jsmoove winning us this game, and called him winning us games throughout the playoffs. Not sure if it counts for my ego but it def counts for the FUCKING SCOREBOARD.   If he's not inconsistent, does that means you're scared he'll do the same thing he's done every game so far? Or you're scared his consistency will catch up to him and he'll have an uncharacteristically bad game? Or you're scared for the Rockets because he'll have an uncharacteristically good game (compared to his consistently elite playoffs so far)   assonance assisted autoassasination.   I'm positive that there's no way you can actually be positive about that assertion. Unless you are Bill Simmons. Which is silly considering - - wait. SN17 ... SN = Simmo**NS** backwards; 17 = B**IL**L flipped and individually mirrored in place.  nah. that's stupid. i'm stupid.     He'll also smile a lot. His smile will look 99% genuine, but something's off.   haha i'm pretty sure i wasn't trying to put him under fire. he was, at the worst, polite. the clue in my comment was where i said "i don't know what i expected exactly but it involved more of us becoming best friends".   I don't own a car. By 'our car' I was referring to the cars with which we were waiting to get into to transport ourselves home.   I don't remember, I was pretty drunk.   I talked to Arian last night after the Rocket's game while we were waiting for our cars in the blue lot below the Toyota Center. Well, 'talked to him' is a bit generous. I talked at him. Told him his kicks were fresh but mine were fresher. He just kinda looked at me for a second, rolled his eyes and goes, "yeah man, they are. they are...", got into his car which had just pulled up and bounced.  Not sure what I expected exactly, but it definitely involved more of us becoming best friends.   hate-bros for life   Yeah but the Thunder have Sam Presti!   1 out of 5 ain't bad!   It's not new. It started when we got Harden, picked up steam when we got Howard, and hit it's full stride when we let our Big-3 walk this past off season.  The first 2 years I was on /r/nba, the Rockets were everyone's second favorite team. It's been interesting watching the transformation from loved to hated.   we don't fly. we fart, with style.   My last name is Ainsworth so fuck this.    hilarious   so he just didn't give a shit because your team sucks. whatever.   except not at all. water boarding is much different and is basically just having buckets of water poured over your head to imitate drowning.   It's because they're an easy organization to use as a bartering chip. Mark Cuban wants them, other teams know that, so if you show interest in joining the Mavs, the other teams have to worry about Cuban throwing money, so if you want them you gotta throw more.    You're not a desired landing spot. See: last 10 FA periods.    Probably because of all the wild horse missions?   Smith is the kind of guy who needs boundaries, structure and supervision to succeed. When he went to Detroit, he went into an environment where he was given almost free reign over himself. It was easy to look at him in that situation and think, "well, here's a horse who can never be tamed, who does what he wants, who doesn't care where his hoofs land."  Yes, Smith is a wild stallion at heart; and all wild stallions can be tamed, though not everyone can tame one.  The Rockets were in the perfect situation to tame him, to put a saddle on him, and to man the reins.  For Smith to reign supreme, he needs the reins of a *team*.      Everyone wants to play with Parsons doe   My reasoning for preferring the Spurs is pragmatic: no 930 tip offs.    right... there's one alleged case of an orca killing a human and it's from 1894.   Pretty sure he means it leads to the orca's tragic death. I don't believe there is any record of a wild orca killing a human.    but...he played more games than Kawhi?   Dawg, no one is "shutting down" high quality sound compression.     he conceivably had the chance when we signed howard 2 summers ago but took the money in detroit (read: played the long con)   he's causing the Rockets to lose   this is why you don't talk before the kibble is dry   lack of depth?   Uhh have you ever seen predatory birds? Forward set eyes make sense for land predators but not aerial predators.        Hold up, you take those other phrases seriously?    I just walk around them with purpose, make direct eye contact with one of them and give a really fucking dissaproving glare like "yo I'll move for you cuz I'm the one that's aware of reality but pay the fuck attention to your surroundings you dopes"   I'm fit, walk everywhere, average about 8 miles a day, but live in a humid and hot city and SWEAT LIKE A MOTHER if the temperature is above 75. Distance I can walk without sweating decreases as the temp increases. Used to make me self conscious but now I'm just like "Wasup im glistnin"   "We'll use our aircraft carriers to completely decimate their battleship fleet because battleships are the most lethal weapons on water and we'll destroy them with our aircraft carriers with no direct support from out battleships in the engagement and while Americs carrier fleet isn't at harbor that doesn't matter because we're about to destroy their battleships which are the best possible naval weapons with just our carriers which are merely support ships..."     i mean, yeah. it's a bigger number. it's a big number. i don't think it represents a bigger impact on the game than boogie's night. i just think that at the end of the day, 50 is flashier and more noticeable to the average person.  i mean, this thread has 260 comment versus 66 in the Cousin's stat line thread. kinda speaks for itself.     https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7RjuwG6Esw   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7RjuwG6Esw   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7RjuwG6Esw   landry w/ game winning block against jazz for nostalgia.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7RjuwG6Esw  carl landry will forever be my favorite rocket. i think that year was my favorite/most memorable season of rockets basketball to date.   right it's super impressive. hakeem holds the league record in 5x5s so i respect the hell out of that stat line. just saying 50 is flashier; not better, flashier.    yeah can i get a large slice of prigioni pizza?   on feb. 11th he had a 9 point game shooting 3-12 FG and missing all 8 3PA. 2 50 PT games, 3 40 pt games, 6 30 point games, 2 15 point games a 17 point game 2 18 point games and the rest 20 point games. as many 40+ games as -20 pt games, so he makes up for the duds.   I somewhat agree, however Harden also had 8rb/6a/3stl. I think they're both equally impressive individual performances but 51 points is simply flashier. Boogie had a monster game though, he looked like a superstar.    Across the board, I wouldnt Curry's numbers are head and shoulders above Westbrook or Harden's. They all are posting MVP caliber seasons purely from a statistical standpoint and they all make worthy candidates.   I think at the end of the season, the votes are going to come down more to "what they think they did with what" - do they prefer Harden leading a challenge for the SW division title and 2nd seed with an extreme dearth of normal starter minutes logged; Westbrook with triple doubles left and right, a nasty bark and nastier bite and a taste for upset on his tongue; or Curry, putting up one of the most beautifully efficient exhibitions of guard play in ages, on one of the most dominant and successful teams the regular season has witnessed?  I think it's gonna be very close, with Harden or Curry taking it home.    I get the egg white one and add an extra egg white for a buck.     Dude...we missed the playoffs for 4 straight seasons after the departure of both TMac and Yao...    because he's un-guardable and people are forced to foul him.   you are in the sw division, you are our division rival. if you are in the same division as someone, they are your division rival. we're not talking about BIGGEST RIVAL, just division rival. get it?    It confuses me that the attitude towards Harden isn't the attitude that is expressed towards Westbrook; they even take the same amount of FTA per game (never hear his FTA mentioned). Harden is just a silly, fun loving guy while Westbrook is the kind of guy you don't want to invite to happy hour.    Which is cool because I liked when he was playing. Doesn't put up numbers but is an actual PG.   Curious now what the average length of a Rockets game is vs. other teams. Can't be that substantial and Harden is a quick FT taker. I mean, the Rockets average 25 FT (4th in the league) and only take 6 more FT per game than the lowest FTA team (Knicks at 19) - so there isn't much of a spread in FTA between teams. 6 FTs take, what, an extra 3 minutes of game time? Max?     of drawing charges. I'd rather them improve their defensive skill than their drawing charges skill.  Averages .2 FTA fewer than Harden on 4 more MPG.   "Stop forcing our defense to foul you or give up a layup."   Messed up bruh, should have said this in the thread about Harden having 5 games with more FTA than the other team.     Total bitch made bro. It must be scary to live in a world where the only viable response to a differing opinion is a silent, yet visible dismissal or "that's bitchmade".   Keep it trill, /r/NBA.  	108
 Diver goes entirely by feel and radio guidance from above   I wonder if they will use those licenses to vote in the next election?   You should read the police blotter or court docket on any local newspaper online and see just how many illegal aliens drive drunk, drive without a registered or insured car and get into deadly accidents. No joke, it seems as if 50-75% of those crimes are committed by illegal aliens. Don't take my word for it, just see for yourself.    It seems once a year I read a new story of some guy mowing his lawn and falling into a collapsed septic tank and dying. Given the fumes and the consistency of liquified shit I bet dying that way is more common than most people realize.       "Brendan Walsh loves his job, but we cant imagine how in the world thats possible. Why? Because he makes a living diving into human crap. Walsh runs a company called East West Dive and Salvage in Melbourne, Australia, that specializes in diving below every kind of no-air environment you can imagine, including raw sewage."                        What about the US Constitution?               If someone wants a gun and is willing to obtain it illegally, they will obtain one. Just look at Chicago, 16 year olds have all the guns they need. Laws only restrict the law abiding.   You also must remember the 2nd amendment to the US constitution. The restrictions you mention are not enumerated by the Constitution. A few restrictions have been allowed but they are almost entirely as a result of John Dillinger and other prohibition era gangsters and the 1968 gun act. Further restrictions will be resisted by those, including myself, who view them as a violation of constitutional law. If you want to have guns restricted then you must change the constitution first. The constitution specifically ensured the people would be armed to act as a check and balance against government oppression and allow the people to revolt if necessary.  As a result, most gun owners  are against giving up their guns or restricting their ownership based on our natural rights      The Left has a long history of never being satisfied with half measure when it comes to ideological issues. As a result, any limited measures of gun control are only stepping stones in an incremental quest for a  total ban over private gun ownership.   I simply don't believe that the Left will quit after a few gun control measures are passed. Wide-scale gun registration or gun permitting schemes would be used to identify gun owners to be used to aid future gun confiscation by government.       Wawagobbler available soon   Ill have those niggers voting Democratic for the next 200 years. Lyndon B. Johnson to two governors on Air Force One   We both agree that the Democrat Party renounced overt racism after a century of vile racist policies.   There is no proof that the GOP as a result decided to embrace racism.  The Southern Strategy is based on a single interview by Lee Atwater in which he stated that the GOP was focusing on economic issues to attract disenchanted Southern Democrat voters who felt the Democrat Party had moved too far to the Left. Atwater stated that it was economics issues and not appeals to "nigger nigger" that would attract those Dixiecrat voters.  The movement of Southern Democrat voters to the GOP was not a sudden event as the result of the 1964 Civil Rights act. The migration was a slow transition that last over 40 years.  No party would embrace racism. Why do you think the Democrats renounced it in 1964? Because racists are a small voting block compared to all voters. It would be tantamount to a political party embracing molesters as a voting block. The upside would be minute and the downside to a party would be enormous.      This Obama policy came to light just yesterday. It is a plan to take away guns from Social Security recipients. This shows how the Left thinks about gun control and ultimately outlawing private gun ownership  http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/07/18/obamas-secretive-gun-ban-for-social-security-beneficiaries/   The Republican Party has a long and sordid present of overt racism.  Oh really? care to share your proof with the rest of us?    Do you honestly believe that the Left will reach a point of a few gun control measures and then never agitate for further gun controls?  The Left has an ideology based agenda. Half measures are not acceptable.  The Left will never stop until private gun ownership is ended   Unfortunately, the Left will never stop at any new gun control measure. After one regulation is achieved then they will move on agitating for the next regulation. This endless push for greater gun control regulations will never end until all firearms are removed from the hands of private citizens.    Republicans and Conservatives have never been the same. The GOP is made up of several factions including RINOs, Conservatives, Religious Right, Libertarians, and establishment DC elitists to name a few.  It is true that Republicans have a long history of opposing slavery, Jim Crow, and segregation. The Democrat Party meanwhile has a long and sordid history of overt racism.   The lesson every country should learn about Germany and the Nazis is to never allow socialists in office ever again.       Obama has done much worse things as president. He could literally commit murder and the Dems would not impeach him or force him to resign.    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQsQqOlPjhs            hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahahahahahahahhahahaahhahaahahahhaahahahahahahahahahahahahahahhaahhahahaahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha   OMalley booed off stage at Netroots Nation after saying all lives matter and white lives matter.  Is anyone else concerned about this? Do all lives matter or just certain ones?   You claimed that the GOP is racist. Where is your proof? I guess they don't teach critical thinking in high school anymore.         Being a political Conservative is not the same as an environmental conservative. Being a political Conservative involves such things as favoring limited government and personal freedom. TR was certainly not in favor of those things    Maybe not a lateral political selection such as Sharpton. Is it too much to ask that only Conservatives be  pictured? Do we need to pollute every aspect of our culture with the cancer of Leftism?   Do you even know what the so called Southern Strategy was? You make the assumption that Lee Atwater's comments regarding the GOP focusing on economic issues and not "N*gger n*gger" is somehow  proof that ever since the GOP has embraced racist policies, racist candidates, and racist voters? If that is your "proof" then you really need to earn your GED.   He can still buy candy with pennies. Dad's beer purchases require dollars   Sorry but his Progressive views were in no way Conservative. Call it anything you like but he was a Progressive and a Collectivist. You are splitting hairs by denying his Leftist leanings     Any proof of that? I realize the Democrats renounced racism then but there is no proof that the GOP embraced it as a result. It is people like you who lie that makes the political climate in this country impossible. Shame on you   He was a Progressive and a collectivist. Is there any difference?   Where do you get your silly ideas about the GOP being racist? Did you know that the Democrat Party opposed the Civil Rights act, opposed integration, formed the KKK, enforced Jim Crow laws, poll taxes, oh and favored slavery?    When one considers that Conservatism and Socialism are diametrically opposed political concepts then I am super indignant. Imagine if a subredditt called Progressives_R_Us had a picture of Ted Cruz on its masthead.    The Democrat Party supported slavery, supported segregation, started the KKK, initiated Jim Crow laws, poll taxes, opposed integration and the Civil Rights Act.  Where did you get your GED?   Take the money and refill with pennies and nickles. A three year old won't know the difference      It is an insult to Conservative's intelligence                  Anything would be better than it is today under the current regime.                                             You need to go back to school my friend. Naziism, as well as Fascism, were socialist movements. Hitler opposed Communists because he considered them as too internationally focused and too Jewish. He also viewed them as competition. The Nazis were the National Socialist Workers Party. Hitler was a prolific socialist writer and philosopher.    He came up with the idea for national socialism by combining the key elements of socialism such as government (or community) control over the means of production and a government centric society at the expense of personal liberty with  elements of nationalism.   Control over the means of production and distribution does not necessarily mean government owns an industry. It can also mean the government (or community) controls privately held industry.      Hitler was a socialist. Is the author suggesting Walker is a socialist too?                               Owning guns and giving info to Google is unacceptable in my book.                   Thanks to Ellen Pao, Asian-Americans will no longer be saddled with the insidious stereotype of being bright, hardworking and competent.    then you need a history book. They are completely opposite of what they were in the past.  I have a degree in US History and I don't remember the part where the Republicans became racists. Are you sure you are not simply repeating a Liberal fantasy?   So what you are saying is one speaker, made one statement, that was taken out of context, and that imputes  every Conservative as being racists?  You do realize that the Democrat Party favored slavery, started the KKK, initiated Jim Crow laws, favored segregation, and opposed the Civil Rights Act?  You have to be trolling me because even someone with a GED would know these things.     Racism Hate Bigotry  Have any proof of that?   We can never solve our differences if people cling to false dehumanizing characterizations.          Uranus Attacks!   To be honest though, being Australian, those events probably would have happened to him anyway.    As with all things Leftist, it is not about the people but about the power.                            Why can't you answer my questions? Maybe you are a fraud and a silly troll?      It used examples from as far back as 1967! Reagan evolved from a Hollywood Liberal into a Conservative. His support for amnesty was a failure and proves that we can't have another round of amnesty for illegal aliens until the border is sealed don't you agree?  My original comment was that JFK would be rejected by today's Democrat Party because it has moved so far to the Left. Do you agree?   Sorry but Reagan was a true Conservative.   http://www.theblaze.com/blog/2014/03/03/the-11-principles-of-a-reagan-conservative/  He was not perfect but he was infinitely  better than  today's RINO GOP candidates.   crooksandliars is your source?????really?????   You are totally wrong.  I am a hard core Tea Party member and i would vote for Reagan today. You can either believe a lie you have been told or you can believe a fact coming from a direct source.  Being a Leftist i know you will choose your religion over fact      McCain is a RINO, Jeb Bush is a RINO. Reagan was a true Conservative who was a Liberal in Hollywood but his views evolved. One can't simply take his earlier views and try to play gotcha. I am telling you with all sincerity that Reagan would be embraced by the Tea Party today. The Left lies by claiming that the Tea Party is extreme but in reality, the Tea Party is simply garden variety, historical Conservatism.  The Left also lies by claiming the Tea Party is racist but they NEVER provide any proof of that lie.    Black and white fact. Doubt it if wish         It is dismaying that much of science is becoming a captive of politics. Maybe it has always been that way.                      See, you prove my point. Please get your GED and then come back to r/politics and at least try to make an honest, factual argument. What r/politics doesn't need is just another high school drop out shooting off his mouth with juvenile attempts at snark.   Snark is an art and you are just finger painting   Totally wrong. As a hard core Tea Party member, I do not agree with every policy Reagan proposed but I agree with the vast majority of his policies. The Democrat Party of today would reject JFK almost entirely as being not far left enough.    It's sad how JFK would be totally rejected by today's far Left Democrat Party.    Name calling does not come easily to me but accurately describing some lame user's comments does. Have you ever made an educated or insightful  comment on r/politics?                  uneducated, rude, and unoriginal is no way to go through life. Did you ever wonder why people really don't like you?   They could have said that the mod in question and the admins had philosophical  differences in their vision of the subredit. They tried to come together but they couldn't. That type of statement would not expose anyone to legal liability.  The mod that was fired was almost certainly an at will employee, meaning she could be fired for any reason or no reason at all.    The facts surrounding her firing are few. That type of situation results in many conspiracy theories. The official reasons given are obviously not true. I don't know why they just don't tell us the truth   That is very interesting and very believable    OK thanks. The money talk just seemed random and vague to be brought up there. They discussed no other issues that they were concerned about     Why was the subject of money changing hands brought up there? Seems odd that such a random problem for that subreddit would be brought up then and there   It seemed vague to me. I can see your point. Thanks for your input.    I don't understand the term soap-boxing. I am not trying to say or promote any point of view. I am only trying to understand the statement made explaining this situation. I admit I could have read something into the statement that is not there.     I asked a question and now you are asking me the same question. Are you from New Jersey?    Imagine if they did that to a group of black reporters. I bet everyone would have such a big laugh     That post says exactly the opposite of what you said.  FYI: asking a question is just that, asking a question. I was not making any kind of statement. Please read with more comprehension. Thanks   My original askreddit was rejected. I used terms such as the name of the mod in question and the subreddit involved.    But are they suggesting money changing hands is a problem for that subreddit?   "We have taken the day to try to understand how Reddit will seek to replace Victoria, and have unfortunately come to the conclusion that they do not have a plan that we can put our trust in. The admins have refused to provide essential information about arranging and scheduling AMAs with their new 'team.' This does not bode well for future communication between us, and we cannot be sure that everything is being arranged honestly and in accordance with our rules.

Political discussions are so much more enjoyable when you are educated and can grasp what is being discussed and actually add something to the discussion other than lame attempts at humor.   BTW regarding your username, Hobbes was a philosopher and not just a stuffed tiger from the comics.    Good luck   Just because my viewpoints differ from you does not mean I am stupid. Personally I respect others' opinions. It's sad that you feel threatened by diversity.    Huh? Are you commenting on the right post? This is reddit r/politics.   Perhaps you should MYOB. Perhaps you should try it.   Imagine if they did that to a group of black reporters. I bet everyone would have such a big laugh   Funny how Liberals NEVER seem to add anything to a serious political discussion except very lame snark. I bet if you were educated or at least politically astute you would have added something meaningful to the discussion. Sadly you were unable. Ha ha but at least you were funny.... not....   Literally a hundred other redditors have made that exact same comment. If you can't be funny, interesting, or enlightening, at least you could be original. You must be such a hit with the ladies!   Hey, remember the last time the mainstream press wrote a negative story about Obama? Nah me neither.       Imagine what your reaction will be when president Cruz does the same thing to the press.    The mainstream media embargoes such negative stories on Ms.  Clinton.   Using actual photographic proof prevents Ms Clinton's spin machine from denying such events ever took place.       You are delusional. Someone is raping these women. Again, if it is not Mexicans then who is doing the raping?  I am sorry that the facts here do not follow your narrative of how reality is supposed to be. Sometimes people like Trump speak the truth and he is not motivated by racism. Regardless, those on the Left can never even consider such realities. There is only the narrative that white males are racists who are motivated by nothing else.   What a sad little rigid, closed worldview you have.                                                                                         Who is doing the raping of 80% of the women and girls trekking to the US from Mexico and Central America? Is it white American police? Is it college frat boys?   Mexicans, whether they be illegal aliens, coyotes, police officials are the ones doing the raping.   But by and large, when they arrive in the US, they do not become criminals.  By entering the country illegally they are criminals as soon as they cross over the border. Granted most are not going on and committing further crimes but a disturbing percentage are and most are going on public assistance as soon as they arrive here which is a violation of welfare statutes.    12 million. That policy was supposed to solve the illegal immigration crisis. All it accomplished was to make 12 million illegal aliens citizens and opened the door for tens of millions more that we are discussing today. If we do not close the borders then once the illegals here now are legitimized then a new crop of millions more will come across the border. The cycle will never end   ALL of the other candidates are milquetoast politicians who say nothing but lame platitudes and vague policies. Bernie Sanders is different in that he offers specific (yet tired and historically failed) socialist policies. Scott Walker and Ted Cruz are offering interesting solutions but too many Conservatives have promised to give DC an enema but end up becoming seduced by power and cash.   Who do you believe is stating anything substantive that has not been processed through the politically correct, focus group, mush machine?   Did you know that 25% of Mexico's citizens currently reside in the USA? 25%!!!!!!!!!  How can anyone claim that there is a zero net increase in the two countries' populations?  I would also like to add that the vast majority of Americans living in Mexico are wealthy or at least self supporting. No one is claiming the same for Mexican nationals living in the US.   "Rape can be perpetrated by anyone along the way, including guides, fellow migrants, bandits or government officials, according to Fusion."  Clearly the rapists are not limited to coyotes.    This adds nothing substantive to the claim of illegal immigrants being rapists.  Except that the article I offered gave proof that the 80% figure was accurate. BTW the article was published in Fusion which is owned by Spanish language broadcaster Univision.     Most of the route consisted of Mexico so most happened in Mexico we can assume.  Who lives in Mexico? Mexicans  Trump said that the illegal aliens who are streaming across the border are not Mexico and Central America's best and brightest. Many are drug dealers, gang members, rapists, and welfare recipients. Can you refute those claims? He did not say that every Mexican was a rapist.   80% of illegal alien women trekking to the US are raped. All Trump did was state this fact.  Who is doing the raping then?  BTW, Obama called illegal aliens gang bangers on Wednesday.  Video proof:  http://dailycaller.com/2015/07/01/obama-refers-to-some-illegal-immigrants-as-gang-bangers-during-town-hall-video/    Please read this explanation of the wide spread rape of illegal alien women coming across the border. Who is doing the raping then? White cops? UVA frat boys?  http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/09/12/central-america-migrants-rape_n_5806972.html   Sorry but it's true  http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/09/12/central-america-migrants-rape_n_5806972.html   But...Is what Trump said true or not?   Is what he said about illegal aliens true or not?  	202
    Where do I get one of those bumper stickers that says "My other vehicle is on it's way to Pluto?" Also, do you have one for Mars?   Windows 8 keeps having hiccups on a relatively new HT-PC. By hiccups, I mean that the icons seem to overlap but not function and  switching between windows is problematic. If I restart Explorer in task manager, everything goes back to normal. The specs are: AMD A10, 8 GB RAM, 4TB storage. I'm running it at an odd resolution on my TV, not sure exactly what, slightly less than 720P through HDMI.   Mostly the 1.5 - 2.0 mL tubes   Anyone know where companies get their little shipping containers? I'm thinking like the ones Abcam uses that are stackable or like the little paper boxes that fit 4-5 and are divided. I'm not thinking like the freezer boxes that store 96 (or some number thereabouts).  Thanks   It's very interesting to me how increasingly often, recently, we'll target the body's pieces that are being taken advantage of by a pathogen rather than the actual pathogen. The body isn't about to change to blockers like the pathogen can in response to antivirals or antibiotics.   That's because governments always try to throw the same outdated regulations at them taxi drivers have. Taxis shouldn't even still have some of the regulations they have anymore.      I thought this was the case, but there's nothing recent, otherwise I'd say look at them. Wonder when they're going to try and make an 'artificial gravity' by spinning to see if that fixes things at all.   https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/6060868?hl=en  This one seems to imply you need a Music Key subscription, thought you didn't need that.

    I would totally be okay with 3 Tomb Raider universes:   - Hollywood Survival Action TR Reboot/Rise of  - Isometric Puzzle Platformer Co-Op Gaurdian of Light series  - Tomb Raider: Shadow of The Colossus edition  They are all pretty special, it would seem :)   I feel more welcome (never had a bad experience) in this subreddit compared to others, for some reason - so in response to the positive skew in this community I want to be all giving 'n stuff. I found some keys I haven't used and thought I could gift them.  Games (Humble gift games - so they are legit)   - Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic   - Star Wars The Force Unleashed   - Star Wars Battlefront II   - Dead Island GOTY and Saints Row: The Third (come together, unfortunately)   - Bioshock  Please don't comment unless you earnestly plan to play, or going to give the game to someone who will play the games :]  Please redeem/reply with confirmation them ASAP, will PM the codes! I will try to be random in picking recipients.   Peace!   AH ok, so must be other cinematics they did? Still, all the witcher cinematics have been stellar.      I think the studio who did this is making a witcher feature film? http://www.reddit.com/r/witcher/comments/37fwz5/the_witcher_movie_is_being_developed_by_the_oscar/   Tolfdir, teacher at the college of winterhold ): he had a great voice sorry to hear of his passing RIP   It sounds better to some peopl too, warmer and organic. If that's your taste.   Love Kevin sad to see him go hope to see him pop up somewhere soon.   Listen to the interview it wasn't about hyperbole.   9 News with the hard hitting journalizm   Bill Shorten should also step aside... So should Tony Abbot, Joe Hockey, - hell all of Liberal and Labor - that'd be sweeeeet   I used to be quietly pro euthanasia, until I heard the deeper arguments against it, it's not all slippery slope arguments.  Heard a really smart lady on the radio make some excellent points about how extremely careful you have to be introducing it to a society.   It actually put me on the fence, i strongly recommend everyone inform themselves of the opposing views and the deeper reasoning. I'm not qualified to argue for or against. But as someone who was default in favour of euthanasia, the opposing argument highlights complexities that can definitely make you think.   I believe the interview was on ABC RN radio national a couple of months ago.  Think it's this one: http://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/religionandethicsreport/the-dangers-of-legalising-euthanasia/6570898  On mobile atm so cant verify if that's the lady I heard.   One of if not the best reboot in gaming. Loved the first one.   Yep he's really measured and not overly cynical. This was a beautiful video.   Bratterz, looking forward to this, hope it works smoothly.   I'm looking for Whoreson Junior at the moment and got to meet Roche, but I picked Yorveth, he doesn't seem to be annoyed at me or anything. Is this normal?  My save would have imported correctly surely? ._.   Any time I see someone being attacked personally or harshly mob criticised I tend to defend them. It's not good, I hate seeing online mobs or people even going near stirring that shit.    Do you think being angry and outraged is going to help people get what they want or make this community better at all though? I think it does both things a disservice.  Shaming tactics or personal judgements don't work, instead of angry videos and angry comments, fueling even more angrier videos and worse comments. Maybe people should focus on a more diplomatic tone for any future controversies. It will get people a lot further.   There's nothing wrong with calmly voicing disappointment but personalizing this is uncouth.      Can we drop this witch hunt? Obviously no one is going to play ball when part of the critical crowd has actively abused and personally attacked them. It's an unfortunate effect of the outrage machine places like this subreddit actively fuel.  This is the problem with this community and outrage, it gets the absolute opposite of what people want.   If you want an apology off someone, do you fuel a community to undermine them, attack them, yell at them and make conspiracy theories? Or do you talk respectfully about your disappointment, avoid speculation and stick to principals of mutual respect and kindness?  Godwin's law already broke in the first couple hours of this thread's existence, and people are clueless as to why anyone at the studio might be a little defensive?   Actually there are a lot of different communication practices that work extremely well, unfortunately they don't happen to satiate egotistical desires (to put down, feel superior etc.) that violent communication entails - this means people are under the false illusion that the only way to solve a problem is to aggressively voice discontent.  Basically, it's clear Gearbox people feel upset and defensive because there have been many people who attacked them personally and viciously. No reasonable person is willing to parley when people are actively fueling a rage machine against them.  AC:M players feel upset because they didn't get the game they believed was coming, based on the ads.  Do you honestly think if everyone had calmly stated their disappointment with the product, without judgement or assumptions over the character of gearbox staff or any other extraneous side stories, that we wouldn't have a better outcome?  Instead, this anger basically built up a bunch of walls and disillusionment with the critical base and now people are angry about that too?   It's pretty obvious what happens if you get angry and abusive at someone, they are not going to play ball. Just a natural fact.     Do you think he's likely to apologize if he hears he's being called gaming hitler?  Do you think anyone would react in an amenable way to a mob which is actively attacking them?  There is a human being on the other end, remember that.  The outrage machine goes on :/   That's really cool, I can't wait til these types of projects finish and we can play classic games with modern bells and whistles. It's such a neat way to experience old titles.   I disagree, in the grand scheme of things this is very little to get genuinely angry about, we need to focus on positive restoration of what the gaming community wants/needs. Rather than attacking people and demanding it, which ultimately won't yield that good a result.   "Don't attack someone personally" is more how I would characterize it.    Im concerned about the anger in this community taking the precedent.    How do you know? Why do you get to assume whats okay and not okay to say about the guy? Why do you think that will ever get anything you want out of gearbox by doing that?   Is it worth this kind of outrage? Let's not forget people take this tone of argument too far to justify abusive language and that will just make any dev defensive. No apology will come if you attack someone relentlessly, it's not kind or nice.   Its like 60 bucks. If that money was precious you wouldn't buy before reviews and if it wasn't precious, what's spending more hours of your life angry going to achieve?  At absolute worst, lets not forget some people enjoy the game, a civil note of disappointment would be sufficient along with future caution if you personally believe it's necessary.   Jeez you don't know the guy, don't you think it's over the top to throw names at people you don't know for, at absolute worst, not getting a game you were expecting?  You're never getting an apology or whatever you want from any human being if you start abusing them. No doubt gearbox had to endure this because of outrage then too. It's Human nature to not want to capitulate to abusive language - so it is counter productive.  Why cant we as a community talk civilly?  	29
 Yes, it's third for me too, behind TS3 and Finding Nemo!   Truly a fantastic movie. It's one of my favourite Pixar movies now, and it has definitely got me hyped up for The Good Dinosaur.   Inside Out! I loved it :D   The Emperor's New Groove is on Netflix, and it's awesome! My favourite movie, though, is Toy Story 3.   For obvious reasons.   The Nexus 6 uses a Qualcomm processor.   Brad Bird - Tomorrowland.   In just saw The Emperor's New Groove, and It's hilarious! I haven't laughed so much in a movie since ages. Why it isn't considered as good as the other Disney animated classics, is beyond me. Edit: Spelling.   You should definitely give Inside Out a shot.   No... It's been there since a few days when the word on the sidebar was changed to "conservationists".   The most epic moment in the movie!   A famous quote from my favourite movie.   See the pic at the end of the sub... It's hilarious!   I hope Pixar shows how the dinosaurs started to look goofy, just like they did with the humans in Wall E.   You mean /r/GalaxyS6Circlejerk?

[This is Up.](http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/up/)   Almost all Pixar movies. And also, The Iron Giant.      Jan Pinkava.   Ratatouille. They had to change the director midways...   Inside Out.   After The Sixth Sense, M. Night Shyamalan was supposed to be the next big thing...   A lot of studies to do this weekend :'(   Ehh... I was 9 when I watched Up and hence it was the first to make me cry.   I don't know... The basic plot looks interesting, but the dinosaurs look very goofy.   Nexus 6 is literally DuARTe.   Up was the first movie to make me cry.   Wreck it Ralph. It was much better than Brave.   Toy Story.   DuARTe wants to spread his light and hence there's no dark theme.   I was watching India vs Zimbabwe today...   Ashes or India vs Zimbabwe?   Anton Ego's monologue at the end of Ratatouille.   "Congratulations San Francisco, you've ruined Pizza! First the Hawaiians, and now you!"    Edit: The above quote is from Inside Out.   Thanks! :D   I had a mathematics and chemistry test...

That one part, though :'(    That one scene had me in tears, though :'(   Yup, it's very emotional. Not as much as Up or TS3, though. But keep your tissues ready!   It's absolutely amazing. Pixar's back, guys.   Nothing. My day was pretty bad.   Yup, I just love cricket! ( Though the loss to Bangladesh was bad)   Cricket.   The Road to El Dorado.   Even I want to see Inside Out badly, it's releasing on the 26th here. I have seen a lot of Pixar movies lately.  	115
 Was that model a genuine model, or was it a gag? He's not very handsome.   Yes    you can see take out of his pocket  That made me cringe so hard. Penn and Teller did not look remotely impressed either.   Not really familiar with Bethesda's release schedules, is there much of a chance of a delay?   This... how is it unacceptable for them to charge a price point that will generate optimal revenue? What's wrong with it OP?   The award for biggest Mangina of all time goes to Michael Sonmore - enjoy the sexually transmitted diseases, enjoy raising Paulo's illicit love child while your wife is off screwing God knows who else, and enjoy the crushing financial burden of the divorce settlement when she finally gets bored of the empty space where your testicles used to be.

Because he's dead.      Truly a dank actor, I hope they have rare Pepes in heaven for him to look at      Well they were fired halfway through filming.   Serious answer: wanting to crush the gay rumors by seriously going overboard with how much he loves the pussy.   Whether the rumors are true or not, I think that's what happened here.   On the other hand, he's probably getting balls deep in his angels every night. Even a faded star can pull pussy if he deludes them into thinking they might become famous through him.    Edit: Guys guys guys, I have news, I have terrible news! My inbox is fucked!  Someone just had their first moderately popular comment.   I think they do:  http://www.dotabuff.com/heroes/bloodseeker/items   http://www.dotabuff.com/heroes/bloodseeker/items  It's hard to say what proportion of players buy BKB based on that, but I'd think it's a safe bet to say third most bought item would breach the 50% mark.   From what I can see, they haven't really removed his major weakness, why is he suddenly so decent? Do people play him Safelane or Mid these days?      She looked fine as fuck. I'd love to ram my cock up her ass.   Dude, you are fucking SICK. I mean... a cumbox, really?  Nice pic btw.   I'm not your guy's moms, so you can do what you want.  Skyfather and above are hard BANNED.   Yep, I've even seen photos of the suit.

Tom Hanks didn't get where he is by not being committed.  The time gap is probably explained by wanting to film What Lies Beneath so he may as well take advantage and lose the weight slowly.   I'm smarter than decades worth of directors, actors, producers and general film crew combined!   Never read it, what's wrong with it?   You've gotta cut sometime bro. I know it's tempting to keep a perma bull going for maximum gains, but if you don't shed the weight you'll never get that dream bod   I can't wait to see this on TIL... Again   Then you're still enjoying it, hence the money is worth it. The other guy implies he will sit through a movie he isn't enjoying at all just because the money is already spent   Because it was nothing but action sequences   Are we talking adults or is this a teen fad?   He could build his own Las Vegas.   Honestly, I'm exaggerating. Movies is right when it comes to certain genres, but I keep letting the hype train for things like superhero movies and action movies get to me. I clearly don't like the genres, but I keep thinking "this one will be different!" It's my own fault.  I thought Mad Max was going to be some revolutionary movie based on the circlejerk, but it just felt like any other action movie with some awesome cinematography, but nothing else to make me care.   I already paid for it  Isn't this essentially just the sunken cost fallacy? The money is lost, you may as well enjoy the next hour of your life instead of continuing to be bored simply because you've already paid. What dumb reasoning to continue watching a movie you don't like.   I legitimately walked out of this movie about 3/4 of the way through out of boredom. Last time I let /r/movies hype me into seeing anything.   It's the final countdown!   So C S T is just changemyview with less subscribers?   I might be mistaken, but isn't brushing more than twice a day considered bad for your teeth (wears down enamel)?  Therefore, wouldn't it be better to brush after lunch for maximum efficiency since there is actual food matter in my mouth then? So I would 'use up a brushing session' when there is actual food stuff in my mouth instead of after waking up, when it's just bacteria that can be destroyed with mouthwash?   It should kill the bacteria that builds up in my mouth overnight, but will not wash away physical matter - which itself is damaging and will attract more bacteria.  I figure, if there is no food stuff in my mouth (as I would have brushed before bed), it seems like a waste of time brushing when I could just mouthwash. I'd rather brush after lunch for maximum efficiency (as I hear brushing more than twice a day is bad, I'd rather 'use up a brushing session' when there is actual food stuff in my mouth).   Just don't answer your phone next time. When they ask (or when you arrive, call them back) just say you accidentally packed your phone in your luggage the previous day and didn't find it until you arrived at the airport. Oops, how inconvenient.   I would brush once after I got home from work and again after dinner instead.   Candyland doesn't use dice.   Batman and Michael Cera face off in the children's luck based boardgame "Candyland". Each player has **two years** prep time to learn the rules of the game and play it with their friends.  The cards are shuffled independently by someone else in another room, and neither contender gets any gadgets or can interact with the board or card in any way beyond their intended use. They play a best of five.  Who comes out on top and is King Kandy's hero?   How do we know this though?  I think the proof seems to be "if it wasn't for that clue, Batman never would have caught the Riddler". But if the Riddler wasn't leaving DELIBERATE clues, Batman might find clues that he he accidentally left. Maybe the crimes are riddled (cough) with clues that Batman doesn't need to find because the Riddler gives away his identity anyway.  Basically, we don't know how good the Riddler is at covering his tracks because we never need to look in the first place; he always leaves obvious fucking shit around.   Wouldn't not leaving clues be the best proof of all?   She's fat.   Remember kids, drink Slash cola   Probably a stupid question, but if it's the cinematography that makes all these shots look great, what is the director's involvement? I thought they'd be the one to decide this stuff.   [Brendan Fraser's website.](http://www.brendanfraser.com/)  My favourite is the about section that stops updating in 2001.  ACT IV: Coming Soon   Yes.   That's 0 words. Date was ruined when you found out she was fat.   Exactly the kind of stuff I was looking for. Would commoners have uttered this phrase or paraphrased it?   That's what I thought 2-3 years ago but now I'm doing fine   I literally just played this movie for four kids at a sleepover two days ago and they loved it      For example, if I picked a random Beethoven symphony, what percentage of the music was written by him? All of it, or would he have instruments he didn't know how to play. Maybe he say down with his go-to violinist and asked him to help him fit some violin into this upcoming piece.   Maybe, but I don't see how the trailers are proof of this.  They're sentimental because they're trying to appeal to your nostalgia.   I never want any character on GoT to die, but the fact they they willingly kill them off, often without fanfare, is part of the reason I like it.  Imagine the impact if loveable Tony Stark was crushed to death in his tin suit by Ultron instead of Ultron being a massive pushover.  MCU needs some deaths. Brutal, sudden deaths too. No sacrificing yourself in the last 10 minutes to save the world with a big goodbye speech and dramatic music. Let's have the villain brutally fuck one of the main characters up out of nowhere.      I suppose it doesn't have to be sudden, but I'd like it to be.   I was unaware that we weren't allowed to have discussions on the subject matter of the picture and just had to stick to "is this facepalm or not".  You're allowed to do whatever you want, I just think you are jumping to conclusions (he's lying so it is effecting him negatively? that's a leap, maybe he's lying because she gets upset over something as trivial as porn)  Also, that you respond to MY comment with this and not the person I initially responded to  I was replying to the chain, the message applies to anyone jumping to conclusions.   but then you say it's not worth figuring out  I was figuring it out. I was just saying there are possible, reasonable alternatives so no need to jump to one conclusion.  Swear to christ guys get so pissy any time they feel like something threatens their "naked girls" time.  I'm not pissy, you sound a bit mad though.  I know so many guys who get pissed if their GFs watch porn by themselves, but if a girl doesn't like it we're just bitches.  The guys are wrong too      http://www.celebritynetworth.com/richest-celebrities/actors/jessica-alba-net-worth/   Her breasts?   I remember this interview, it was released literally a couple of days before reviews landed.  He would have seen the final cut at that point and may have known it was going to reek and decide to backpedal. He may even have already read a few of the bad reviews.   Or she's whipped him and won't let him look at naked girls on the Internet every now and then.  We know literally nothing about this guy or girl or their relationship, why even bother trying to work out if he's an addict or she's against any porn? The facepalm is openly talking about it on Facebook and that's all the matters.   Am I the only one that didn't like this film? I thought the concept was great, but the dialogue was trash.   It's literally just preference. There are albums with no cohesive narrative or reason for their ordering that I like to listen to in order (or sometimes not!) and there are albums that do have an intended listening order or even have songs that flow into one another and I don't even own the entire album, because their hits are fine for me.  Listen to the album in whatever way increases your enjoyment. For most albums, I'll listen to it in full or on shuffle quite happily.   Please no hits, please no hits, please not hits  About 58,100,000 results (0.25 seconds)   AH FUCK   But if the group of people referred to themselves individually as 'Batman', they'd still be Batmans.  You don't have to be a clone of Bruce Wayne. You just all have to have "Batman" as a proper noun. Same as a group of people with the name "Steve" would be "Steves".   Well the joke wouldn't work with a bad villain.   I do not think there has been any villain so far that needed the whole team  Yes, this is the problem. We just happened to be using Ultron as an example   Then the winner squares off against Paul Blart   Definitely   I crafted some decent gear and did a lot of sidequests so now I outlevel everything. I still use them for bosses or throw the occasional Tawny Owl out just to speed things up a bit, but most enemies die in a few hits and are easy to dodge regardless of whether I use potions or not. I might get hit once per fight so it's not worth the hassle of opening the menu up and scrolling down to my pots.  I think that's the main problem with this game - there are lots of sidequests, which  is great, but the leveling isn't spread out enough. You just end up outleveling everything by exploring and before you know it you can equip some mean ass sword or armour.   I don't know, I rarely touch Igni and I'm using a alchemy build and rarely use pots/oils and still finding it too easy. I hope the DLC has enemies that scale with level or something.   I suppose we better make sure to add spoiler tags when discussing Soylent Green too? Better not spoil that twist!  No one is suggesting that spoilers don't become important when 100% of the population has viewed it. Instead, there is a point where something is well known for long enough that it becomes the responsibility of the individual to avoid obvious sources of spoilers and not the community to do so   I still do         He*    $6 a few weeks back   Paul Blart vs The Incredible Hulk   No   I think he meant the movie representing Crackle was a weird choice. I mean, it's really out of left field    I usually do job applications the day after they are listed, is this putting me at much of a disadvantage. Should I aim to do them ASAP?   Are you attractive though?   Adolf Hitler   Fuck off.         Is he dead?   By definition a desert is a place with a lack of rainfall, so yes   How is this a pussy***pass***? She hasn't been charged or let off.  Anyway, I can't even find better sources for this, I'm not sure if it's real. Admittedly it was a lazy search, but her name doesn't come up in any reliable news sources in Google.   What's the perspective here? People are going to die so company's shouldn't work on improving custom service? Because one thing is bad everything else should be?      Plus your father is gay   Geralt and Triss have had a few too many cheeseburgers   I imagine this system would work best along these lines:  -Chores are laid out  -A rotating roster is created  -A dollar value is assigned to each chore  -If someone does not complete that chore on schedule, the next person in line completes it  -The person who didn't do it pays that person  Basically, focus on punishment for not doing rather than payment for doing.   I'm sorry, but no one is getting past the Silverback Gorilla. Period.   It doesn't take me three years to get a psychiatrist appointment though.   Or they should just leave them how it is. It's not exactly hard to explain.   She didn do nuffin wrong   The satisfaction of showing her this video in ten years time would be amazing. I would really love to be apart of that.      OP omitted some improtant details. If you look closely at the sky in Mad Max you can see that there is actually a big, glowing red orb, also known as the Sun. This sun can be visibly seen in the sky in the Borderlands universe.  Vice versa is also true.   Yeah but her figure is terrible. Look at that waistline. Ew   And Conan is 6'4''.    In his vest.   Money? Oil? What exactly? Is it something we can point to and say "yup, there it is!"      sunlight*  I should also clarify I know this because they didn't have electricity back then so that G Beethoven must have done it in the day (he was allergic to candles).      I don't understand this line of thinking.  Film critics reviews are tools. If you generally agree with a critic's opinions, then it's a good tool for determining what movies you watch down the track. Or you can read around the opinions to determine if the movie is something you might like based on their summary. Or they may save you from seeing particularly bad movies (most of the stuff at the bottom of RT wouldn't be to your liking, right? So statistically reviews aid you).  No one can see every movie ever made, reviews are useful.   Wow, a great deal for Steam then if people decide to rebuy it after it gets fixed.   Not as common as you might think. Here are some names: Bob, John, Frank. Notice any Es?   Get it? 221 B's. Sherlock was a beekkeeper and likely kept in excess of 221 bees.   True, but that was the point: it's not worth it and they are fixing it, but only because of the recent implementation of refunds. It's 'unfortunate' (from their perspective).  They still new what they were doing, they're not idiots, it just backfired.   No, but they know about their preferences over a failed product vs a delayed product. The can see the numbers of sales for franchises, gauge consumer interest, and other financial data to determine their preference in this area.  It was also likely the last Arkham game so hurting the brand isn't as important.  Knowing how to actually play the game is irrelevant. Just as they're out of touch with how to put their face in a WiiU, you would probably be completely out of touch with how to make a good return on investment.  They knew what they were doing and it would have worked if not for the unfortunate timing with the refunds system.   Posting [Blank] is cheating! XD   I don't know about *every* president.   Do people actually think this might jeopardise their kid's futures?   The similarity between House and Holmes names should be a dead giveaway. The homage is so obvious.  Both Sherlock and Gregory have Es in it for the few that don't get it            He's saying "Why, is that one better?" not "Why is that one better?"   Yeah, too many correct answers!

He's a complete fucking nut job unfortunately    Jesus, it's not like RDJ didn't get much screen time    So I did this a short time ago with [heroes](https://www.reddit.com/r/whowouldwin/comments/3c9t4h/batman_peter_parker_reed_richards_and_tony_stark/) and said I'd consider doing it again with villains (well, antagonists since I included Adrian). So here it is. Some of this will be copy pasted from the other thread, but I made some changes to the rounds:  It's the current US Shark Tank. Each character goes on assuming a secret identity - that of a young entrepreneur in their early 20s. This eliminates the default perception of the character (ie. investors feeling safer investing with Wayne, a billionaire, as opposed to a mere Uni student). However, they keep their current personalities. **Important note: Any item pitched is free from existing patents, etc., so basically ignore issue of ownership for existing items**  * **Round 1)** Each makes a new invention designed to resolve a common household problem. It can be any problem, but must be applicable to a typical home. They have 24 hours to choose a problem and create the solution. Each has $500,000,000 at their disposal for some overnight R D. And what problem do you think each is likely to address?  * **Round 2)** Any invention they have ever made - they MUST have made it personally (eg. Adrian had Manhattan's help). Pick the one you think would have the most success from each character and pit them against eachother.  * **Round 3)** Each must gain funding for a plan to cause mass destruction. Specifically, they must pitch an item, project or service to that Shark Tank crew that can secretly be used for ulterior evil motives. For example, tricking them into funding a new brand of toothpaste that contains mind controlling fluoride. Remember, the investors will be watching the project careful, so you can't simply take the money for one thing and build a nuke with it.  **Remember to take into account marketability**, affordability (even the Shark Tank guys aren't likely to pitch in for a Batmobile), rough manufacturing costs, etc, and the individual personalities of the Shark Tank hosts. I haven't seen much US Shark Tank, but I know in the Australian version you can get an idea of which host is likely to go for which products.  Finally, major problem with the last one: The Shark Tank guys are rarely ready to invest for more than a few hundred thousand. Is getting an Iron Man suit to market at all possible with that amount?   Iron Man is more maneuverable, more durable and has a greater arsenal with superior target tracking. I think he wins, unless I've forgotten some particular overpowered Megaman abilities (timestopping would be his best advantage).   This is just getting creepy.      Are you for real? Deadliest =/= 100% success rate, just the highest success rate.  Anyway that's irrelevant since he's obviously referring to known assassins.   Is there any requirement on budget, etc. for these movies?  Can't they just get a bunch of costumes from a nearby store and film the Fantastic Four playing frisbee in the studio parking lot for 120 minutes and call it a movie? Who cares if it bombs if you've only spent a few hundred dollars on it.   Literally every Tarintino movie   Haha yeah niggers can be a bit much sometimes but this was something else   Soft drink. They're all fat as fuck as well   I hope this scumbag got a two week paid vacation and a promotion for this.   Daughters*   Once I get my kindle waterproofed, 30 minutes minimum   Where on the Internet?   I would imagine ex-Presidents wouldn't have anything like Ground Force One to drive around in, but do they still get equally detailed sweeps of places before speaking, as many guards on duty in their homes, etc?  What are the major differences?   High quality preferred but does not need to be official.   I want to read in the bath, shower and swimming pool. Ideally I'd like to be able to let it be fully submerged.  (Alternatively, are there any cheap e-readers with 'built in' waterproofing?)   I want to read in the shower   If money is the determine factor for considering something a sport, then I guess investing is a sport too.  Anyway, I imagine most e-sports players would be incredibly poor. After they split their winnings with teammates and owners, etc.   60k isn't even a lot of money, unless these tournaments are numerous and your team is constantly winning. Remember, it's split 5 ways. I can earn more on a part-time minimum wage job in a year.   They were thinking swiggity swooty   Yeah but maybe OP secretly thinks she's ugly too  	163

 Well known? Maybe. Accessible to all types of folks across socioeconomic levels (below mid-middle class [making a distinction between various levels of middle class]), I highly doubt it.  http://townhall.com/columnists/rachelalexander/2013/04/01/toll-roads-and-double-taxation-the-left-and-libertarians-converge-n1554365/page/full  As conservative as this article is, it brings up another good point.  Poor people can't pay toll violations. Rich people can. Rich people also fund these toll road projects with investment and government subsidies.     Hummingbirds...hummingbirds are illegal tender!   It's illegal to keep a hummingbird as a pet. That's for sure.   Sobriety is "not" something to promote... people that want/need to quit weed need to find out about a community somewhere...  I disagree, but completely respectfully. Addiction is scourge on our world, and people need a way out. A community does that.  As for what normies do? I could give two shits. Half my family smokes weed and they handle their shit fine. Legalize it for all I care.   So... here's one.  I take a toll road sometimes. But in order to do that, I have to sign up for a pass online. The pass has an infered signal that tracks when i use the toll road and charges me either per month, or everytime I use it. Also, I don't have to have the pass in my car. My car is registered online.  If you don't have the pass, a computer, and a debit/credit card, you kind of can't drive on the same toll road as me. There are no coin machines or employees. It's all electronic.   Bird law.   This dude is right, MA is dope!

Ended relationships, friendships, and ties with family in pursuit to get high. Almost went to jail a few times. Contemplated prostitution. Pretty familiar with CraigsList. I sadly could go on and on of the terrible decisions I made. To quote MC Chris, "Weed is by my side, it's always been there."  Been sober almost 2 years now. Sobriety isn't for everyone. It's kept me sane.     Dude i took my boyfriend here recently, and he was like,    "WHY WOULD WE WAIT IN LINE FOR FOURTY MINUTES FOR ICE CREAM?!?!"  To which I explained,  "Gucci Mane loves Afters."  He tried it after a lot of convincing. And he loved it. Myself, Gucci Mane, and Afters had won.         eh....

So he messages me:  "Tell me about how you would groom a panda."  He's cute enough, so I do. I tell him about their habitat, their thick coats, their behavioral tendencies in capitivity, animal husbandry, etc.  He's dumbfounded and we make little banter after that.  Fast forward three weeks... I'm sitting in English class, and I see him on Scruff, but I didn't put two and two together, I hardly remember talking to him on OkCupid. We talked for days straight.  So we agreed to coffee. I looked like a disheveled mess with all my books and notebooks for school. He thought it was weird that I called him versus texting him about a change of coffee shop.  It was an awkward first date, I was head over heels for him, he was mildly interested but needed me to wow him.  We were saying our goodbyes, he said he was sure we'd just be friends until he saw me lean on my car, like in the movies. One leg on my car, one on the ground, confident.   He asked me for a kiss right then and there.

We went and saw children playing, a yellow lab much like my own that had been there for years, families working farms so proudly, children going off to the military; the Israeli dream.   I also saw roofs so thick that explosives used to not penetrate them, bomb shelters every 10 yards, 18-22 year old military members on constant patrol, fences and concretes walls not to block out the Palestinians, but to stop snipers.   They live on the edge of oblivion for the Jewish people to have one country. One home. One place to raise a family that is their own.

If the groomer sees a matt, they can shave it out.  Whether your cat is happy or not is sheer anthropomorphism. Aside from hormone levels, you'd have no idea.   All this aside (which I am right, I see it everyday), it probably doesn't matter anymore, because your cat's coat is at this point trashed and unsalvageable, like a blonde that gets platinum hair dyed every single month.   http://www.aspca.org/blog/heat-wave-should-you-shave-your-pet  More!

 Florida may be bigger than you think. Coming anywhere in particular? Panhandle? Disneymania? Gulf Coast? The Keys?       Mmmmm...potato salad.      Seconding the opinion to keep going. It starts rather slow with Frannie and Harolds story, and the beginning of Larry Underwoods story there at the beginning...but it is necessary to their character development later in the story.   Are you reading the unabridged version? That might have something to do with the slow pace at the beginning...The Stand is one of my favorite of King's; it's absolutely worth reading. Stick with it.               Yeah, I know...but good pics.        Florida, touristy beach area.   Domestic beers are $3.50 or $2.50 during happy hours. Imports run from $4 to $7, depending.  Wine by the glass from $3 (happy hour) to $14, bottles from $22 to $40.  Liquor cheapest during happy hour $2 for wells, otherwise from $3.5 to $16 depending on brand.   Two things:   First, wrong sub.   Second, a record only has one groove. The needle travels from beginning to end, reproducing sound (or lack of) along the way. The groove has variations that are transmitted via the record needle as sound waves; this is the music. So, to answer your question, you could theoretically have a record big enough to contain one groove that could have a combination of all the sound ever recorded or to be recorded, but it would be bigger than the universe itself.    Life with Penis 101...lol  I wouldn't want to run without securing myself up a bit...usually with some tighter underwear or when I sport heavily, with a jock strap. (Though I have heard some distance runners like to go without undies at all...*shudder). I am aware of it being there when I'm running or sporting, but no more so than say my nipples. Or my ears.  If I'm in a pool *naked* then yes it sort of floats around. Otherwise it's in the netting you find in most boardshorts/swimwear. It's there for a reason.  Lol...I don't feel the need to pee in my dick. It's in my bladder. Though I can feel my urethra opening up when I pee, especially in the morning...it's not entirely unpleasant.  When I ejaculate, the orgasm sensation is a whole body thing that sort of radiates from my penis, but I am aware of my ejaculate making its way through my urethra, yes.  Occasionally I am aware of my penis growing or shrinking, but not really...it does that through the day. Usually its just a bit of annoyance, I have to readjust myself and I can't always do that in public. The only time I'm surprised by an erection is morning wood, but not even a surprise really, as I expect that...I'm just not aware of it happening. (I've read somewhere that a man gets 6-10 erections a night, something to do with bloodflow IIRC)  Fun Penis Fact: The wrong bike seat can cause your penis to "fall asleep"! Especially on long bike rides...pins and needles are equally pleasant and the Worst. Thing. Ever.     Water hazards are part of the game. You just have to approach them with your skill set in mind. On my home course, there is a lake on the 18th, and its about 250' from the pad. Depending on wind, sometimes I go over, sometimes I drop a placement shot on the shore and take par. It's a good practice in shot shaping and shot selection. Not every hazard has to be bullied through; sometimes finesse is the answer. Share that. Also, lost plastic is the excuse for new plastic!   1. You like cooking chicken thighs, but you make the same thing every time? Try something new. Much of cooking is trial and error, and experience. Look up recipes online and try them. Try different cooking methods; bake them, simmer them in a sauce, slow cook them a crock pot, deep fry 'em. Keep notes of what you like and don't.  2. Shopping should become about staples. (Food staples are the things that I would expect to find in every kitchen: sugar, flour, rice, etc.) Expand on your staples to include different types of the same food. Buy in bulk when appropriate. Over time you will build a kitchen with the goal being that when you want to try a new recipe, you only have to buy one or two ingredients, if that. With most of your staples handled, most (simpler) recipes should be made with ingredients you already have.  3. Practice. There are tons of easy recipes out there, find ones that interest  you and try them. If you're interested in becoming a better cook, look for recipes that feature one (or two) ingredients you haven't worked with before and one (or two) cooking or prepping methods that you haven't done before. Once you learn a skill, you can apply that skill to other recipes. The internet is your friend, but if you prefer the paper cookbooks, pick up a copy of Joy of Cooking; it's still the best all-around cookbook out there. Covers everything from appetizers to desserts, but plenty of information beyond and behind the recipe...gives you some of the *why* of food, not just the *how*.   Happy cooking.   That there is a misprint Sidewinder, probably. The Boss stamp is for a blizzard run, and the plastic doesn't look like blizzard in your picture. (Blizzard plastic with all the freakin' bubbles, right?) Without seeing edge on, or underneath markings (if any) I'd guess sidewinder. Good find either way for a ten.   Again, I don't know Daytona (mostly because the NSB is just so freakin' awesome) but I would imagine there will be so many people out there firing off that as long as you don't bring heavy artillery, or glass or pets, or drugs, or reeeeaaaaly ramp up the assholery, you could do just about whatever you want out there.    Lol...lighting fireworks on the beach is illegal. That's funny.   Honestly, I live just south of Dirtona, in New Smyrna Beach, where it is also illegal to set off fireworks on the beach. The beach is the best place to go see fireworks; all the condos set off big ones, everyone's out there doing their own thing, it's insane. I can't imagine that Daytona is any different.               [Google the Fermi Paradox](https://www.google.com/search?q=theory+of+life+on+other+planets ie=utf-8 oe=utf-8#q=the+fermi+paradox)...it talks about the apparent high probability of life on other worlds and the incredible lack of evidence of any life on other worlds. It's too heavy to get into here, but one of the neat things about Fermi's equation is the quantifying of Time.  Think about just how incredibly big the Universe is. Even if other life forms had some sort of faster than light drive, Time would still be a huge factor. Maybe we're the first in an timeline of life that will stretch for millenia...or perhaps we're the last folks on that timeline. It may be that the Universe just absolutely teems with life...but at sufficient distances that travel between them is near impossible...or long enough that by the time we get there (or they get here) that civilization is long gone, and turned to dust.  Dig into Fermi's theory. It's an interesting thought experiment, and it helped me begin to understand just how freakin' big the Universe is, and that big means...time, not just size.   Now that is odd. Why would people willingly live in such a place? They don't even have hot dogs apparently....   Do people still live there?    Yep. Similar in Florida. We'll put mango salsa on just about anything, but I've never had it on a dog. We get so many yankee visitors here, the majority of my hotdog experience has been more New York than Key West.   Dress nice. Smell good. Smile. Look eager, but not crazy. The second interview with the GM is decision-making time. Most of the time this is not a "formality" interview, but more like the other managers winnow through the other applicants, and bring in a few for the GM to choose from. If the job is in the US, you more than likely will be only offered server minimum, so no negotiation there, but do ask, it looks intelligent. You may know that you have the job at the end of the interview, or it may be a follow-up phone call situation. If you don't hear from them in a week or so, give them a call. Once. Just once.  Good luck!       You're 19, essentially a grown-up; you have to decide what is right for you, and what is right for you and your bf. As long as you live in your parents house, however, you must respect their rules and beliefs as a matter of respect. I recommend some soul-searching as to how you feel about your own views regarding pre-marital sex, and then talk to your bf about those views. Then maybe get a hotel room or something where you can have some privacy...or his house. Or move out.                                     My guitar. My life has had its ups and downs, just like  everyone else, but I've started over so many times I've lost count. The one thing I would always do before giving up on whatever was happening was sling my box across my back before I hit the road. I've had that guitar for almost 25years now and every time I look at it in reminded of how far I've come and how much I've overcome. Its become sort of a talisman for my ability to survive anything that life may throw at me.   I've lived in both cities. I like them both. If the urban sprawl of Orlando is not your thing, you're not going to like the Tampa area. It's very much like the Orlando metro area. But Tampa has a vibrant music and art scene, and there are quiet places to find in the surrounding area. I grew up in Pinellas Park area, and the Gulf beaches are awesome, and all the the littler cities along the gulf are kinda chill. Not a lot of wide open green spaces though... I think I prefer Tally. Great music scene, lots of art and events, but it still has a little bit of a smaller town feel. It's neat to experience the ebb and flow of the city as well. It's a totally different city when all the students and all the legislators are in town, and in the summer it just gets quiet. Making friends in Tally could be a little more difficult than in Tampa, because of that ebb and flow. You'll meet lots of folks that are only there for four years or so. Tampa area safety is going to be a lot like Orlando. It's a toss up whether I'd feel safer on the OBT or on Ashley Street at 2 in the morning. Tallahassee is kinda weird in that while it does have a "wrong side of town", it also is very mixed. You have sort of rough neighborhoods in the same area as nicer places, restaurant row is two blocks from skid row, the homeless shelter is right down the road from all the best bars and clubs. High crime for a city its size, but mostly because of the youth of the city. Average age is way lower in Tally than in the Tampa metro area.    Figuring out what people want is actually...incredibly hard. It's easy if you're taking care of the same 15 people at a small downtown craft-beer heavy bar, but a full-size restaurant in a tourist town is a strange animal. I see my locals, and I talk to them, but most of our cheddar comes from visitors. I have no idea what's hot in the Carolinas right now (where many of my visitors are coming from), in a few months I start getting GA, MS, AL people, and who knows what they want? They often don't know themselves!  Then my yankees, and soon after, my Canadians. It's not just my beer selection to consider, either...I also have to be concerned about liquor and wine, not to mention my menu at large. A lot of it is just guesswork. We listen to requests, but I tell you more often than not, one guy drinks that wine/beer/liquor, and it sits on my shelf.   This. All this is my beer philosophy basically. I will never be a biergarten, because I'm a Steakhouse. And we're pretty good at that, but our customer base is changing and not everybody wants BMC. It's our job to offer an option, but it has to be an option that will move, and make people happy. On tap I have Bud, Yuengling, SA seasonal, Stella, and Miller. Thinking about pulling one and featuring something from one of our local brewers. I have bottle Bud, BL, Coors, Miller, Ultra, Corona, Heine, and room for two-three more. That's where I want to fill in some interesting choices...without sitting on inventory.   SA Seasonal on the taps. Yuengling on the taps. I can't do Guinness, because I won't fake it with out Nitrogen to push the kegs, and bottles were featured in the past and just didn't sell very well. I'm considering some darker beers for winter, but dark beer plus summer sun plus tourist is a bad idea.   I'm a fan of the UFO, I didn't think about that one.   I love Florida Cracker, just recently tried it. Can't get it through my current distributors, though.   Already have SA Summer on tap. Right next to Blue Moon.    Requesting samples of Hazy Sunrise Wheat from my distributor.   Killians and Leinenkugel are still favorites of mine...lol.   Is that Beach Blonde, from St. Pete? That stuff is amazing. Considering that one too.   Yep. Already carry SA Seasonals, and Blue Moon on the taps, have run Shocktop before as a bottle special.   Amber bock is one of the beers that was underperforming for us. We pulled it to make room on the tap tower.   In our house, priced slightly higher than your local bar.  Doms (bud and miller) $3.50/$2.50 on happy hour. Imports (Heine, Stella, Corona) $4.50/3.50 Craft beers rotate so it depends on cost, but I try to hit the $6.00/5.00 point.   These are all valid points, but going into July-August, I'm stuck with the tourist trade. In this town, that means folks from the Carolinas and mid-florida. I try to keep a few classier beers around for the folks that like to drink Beer (not beer), but I rotate a bottle selection and a tap each two-month period. Right now I have an empty tap, and running down our Small Town's Not Your Fathers Root Beer. What I'm looking to do is have an option where I can coax another buck or two out of those people that are going to want a Bud or a Miller or a  Busch...something light, something yellow, something American...but also something that can benefit those customers that don't want boring beers. Tough call I know. As we get past July-August, my customer base, for lack of a better way of putting it, gets a little "classier", and then I can focus on trending beers, and higher price points, but I have to get through the rest of summer first.   Though good suggestion on Beer Dinner though...I had debated on doing a prie-fix menu option on the weekends, it would be nice to offer a pairing with wine and one with beer. Thanks for that.   Orange creamsicle peaks my interest. I wanted to stay away from the fruity beers, but mainly because everything here on the beach is lemon shandys. We just featured Small Town's Not Your Fathers Root Beer (American ale, 5.9%abv, tastes like frekin' root beer. We do a float with vanilla ice cream and Absolut Vanilla Vodka whipped cream. Yum!) Maybe that's something that might work for us. I'll check my distributors and see.   Oh, that's not fair. We have a growing and vibrant craft beer movement here...just not at this particular restaurant. I'm doing my best to change that, but I also have to consider what my customers are already buying and what they will buy.   Love OBP and OBP2. That may be what I go to if I can't find something for the July-August people.   Lol. Now you get it. Added it on tap and it's moving.    That's a good point. Thanks!   Yeah, me too. I've done extensive work since taking over here, both on liquors and beers. Great wine list, always had been, but nothing new or innovative with either beer or liquor. Trying to change that for the better. (This month has been Small Town's Not Your Fathers Root Beer. Sold like a barn afire.)   We run SA seaonals on tap. They don't sell overly-well, but they are a nice standard on our draft towers.   Yuengling is our third best seller, behind Miller and Bud.   I thought about a cream ale for the summer.   We have had little luck with IPAs here.   The summer crowd here on the East coast of Florida are not very beer educated. I need something that will both be acceptable to the "Bud longneck" and "Busch light" crowd, as well as someone with a little more of a "Beer IQ". I've eliminated anything summer fruity like Shandys and Ciders, and looking to hit a price point about a buck more than Bud, Miller, Coors, etc. Any ideas?   Get out. You don't want anything to do with that place. Yeah, sure you may grow and get opportunities there; but probably because folks are too wasted to do their jobs well. Things won't get better in a different position. Restaurants survive on teamwork, sounds like there isn't much there.   Manager, FOH, BOH 25+yrs.

Male in a LTO with a woman that looooves the buttsecks. She was very similar to you, uncomfortable but willing to try new things, years later she's a huge fan. There were times that the buttsecks was nasty. It does happen. Not a big deal, we shower together afterwards almost every time anyway. Nowadays, it's just something that happens sometimes, no big deal. IF he's a fan of the butt, and if he's a fan of you, it's not gross, it's not weird, it's just something that happens sometimes, and he'll be cool about it. Now you just gotta feel cool about it.   I watched this episode last night on Hulu, I somehow had missed it. I loved the play on "Pet Semetary". That joke is old, though.          I filmed two separate parts. On one, action is to the left, on the other, action is to the right. The background remains the same, and the camera placement remains the same, I want the two sources videos to blend into one video that shows both action on the left and right at the same time with the background clear and no fading or transparency issues. Help!                        I like the hell outta the Doctors, but they're closer to Arabian Disco than they are to metal.   Metal?    Yep. Classy right there. Just down the road from me, like literally about four minutes or so.                               Our holes are on poles.       It sounds like you have a pretty good handle on how you feel about things here, but I'll just share with you this one thought.  You only get that one chance.  If you find later in life some regret, there's nothing you can do about it. If you do walk however, and find that it was not gratifying at all, you're only out time and money.             I'm in. Starting tonight.       Whew. I was almost scared to think of how these changes might affect me, and worse, that I might have had some small part to play in it. But Big Ole Murican Jeesuz told me (through the blessed Tea Party) that I don't have to worry about it....because it's just leftist communist gay marriage proponents faking it up so that we will accept Obama coming dictatorship. What a relief!   Oh, if there were only more of you. It's been my experience that for each server like yourself, I've got four that will stand at the bar and bitch about how long their drinks are taking!   This is true. But I also share with the folks that I'm training that when you're recovering from a illness, food-bourne or otherwise, you have a compromised immune system.    I've worked in this industry for 27 years. I love food service and everything about it. I've worked white tablecloth to family dining to TGIChilibees fast casual. In all that time there has been one hostess that I thought really did a great job 100% of the time. One.   Yep. I've seen some terrible terrible things in the meat room. If people knew more about their food I don't think they would ever eat out again.   Lol...not all of us do. Mostly I think it's the disconnect in the way people relate to the restaurant. We train our servers to think that the most important thing in the restaurant are the people in their section; they must take care of them at all costs, and we train our chefs and cooks that they are responsible for the entire restaurant at any given time, at least when it comes to food. In that situation you have servers focused on getting a side of whatever for one of their six customers while the kitchen is taking care of 144 guests on the rail...it can get frustrating, and there's little understanding of the other positions plight.    Lol...no. Any problems I have I'm usually sourcing with the suppliers. I get some communications from USDA, as well as FDA, and DOH, mostly regarding any food bourne illness outbreaks, or known contaminants in the food supply. (Think like the recent E-coli contamination of spinach, leeks, radishes, etc over the last couple years.)   Yeah....I'm not the best dinner guest.    Not as much as you would imagine. Some of the horror stories have been more about bones/cancerous materials in steaks. (Like tumors)    I am a chef/supervisor/food-safety expert for a small chain of steakhouses.    Florida is big. North Florida has some really decent remote-ish woods. Florida also has the ocean to the south and east, and the gulf to the west, both excellent places to view. Okeechobee lake in the south is big enough that the center is almost complete city light free.       Hard to talk about this without spoiling some stuff for you.   HIA is two novellas and three short stories. They are all interconnected.   There is a major character that you need to meet. He figures heavily in one of the novellas, but he also influences some of the things that happen in the other novella and two of the short stories. (Debateable, but yeah) This character is important in the last short story, with another tie-in to the dark tower. (It is not a necessary tie-in, but more of an "a-ha" moment when you achieve resolution with that character.)  So short answer? Read it. Low Men in Yellow Coats, the first novella is a must. Read the rest, because they're good, and connected to LMIYC. Read the last short story for what appears to be a mystery, that later is resolved in the DT series.   But, that's just, like, my opinion, man.   Hearts in Atlantis, at least.                         ummm....thanks for not saying "they're"....whoops.            Restaurant chef/manager here. Hot, standing, bending, running, all damn day long.  1. Shower. Every day before work. (After work too, if you're gross.) 2. Dry dem nuts. Don't dress over wet. 3. Clean clothes. Every time. 4. Some powder. Doesn't seem to matter which kind. I swear by just simple plain corn starch. Others have an unholy fascination with Gold Bond. Try a few, find one you like. Use it, everyday. 5. When you get home,  clean up. Don't go to bed greasy or sweaty. Let that area air out, don't lock everything up in tight whiteys when you get home, get some baggy boxers, and let em breathe, son.     We are ~~a subreddit~~ dedicated to ~~inspiring~~ people ~~to write!~~ Find a ~~prompt that moves you and respond with a~~ story ~~or a poem.~~                Don't be swayed; do your research. Dirty is a myth. Uncut is the normal. Google will be your friend...but be advised, my wife and I got wrong information from doctors!   Here's what I remember:  There is a small decrease in the transmission of some STIs...but it is a small percentage, easily mitigated with the use of condoms, which you would be hopefully teaching, and he will hopefully be using.  The increase in UTIs is real in cut vs uncut...but would you cut  your ear off just to keep it clean? The difficulty for us has just been education our son about how to keep himself clean, and really hasn't been a problem for us.  The cut vs uncut "normal" argument? Well, if he decides later in life, he can certainly elect to get a circumcision while it's quite a bit more difficult to regrow (stretch and cover; google it, it's horrific) his foreskin.  Having a foreskin does have its benefits. Besides being the norm for our body design, it increases sexual pleasure and increases sexual response, both good things for your adult son.  The main thing to remember is that this is a decision between you and your SO. Not friends, not family members, not neighbors. My wife and I are happy with the decision to not circumcise our son, and have had no problems with that, at all, period.    Yeah, they can be loud, too.    That sounds like a Mockingbird to me. Late night, 11pm to 3am or so? Call goes through all sorts of different calls, timbres, pitches, etc? [Mockingbirds](http://animals.nationalgeographic.com/animals/birding/northern-mockingbird/) aren't just making random noises, they are mimicking other bird species. There has been proof in the past that mockingbirds don't just learn from the birds around them either; they learn from other mockingbirds...there have been incidences of mockingbirds mimicking the calls of extinct birds!                                That title hurts my head.      Gonna go ahead and break the first rule, and combine with our in-state rivals.  We could call ourselves the State of Florida State Insemenagators.  We could have had Jameis in jorts over to the Driskell's for a Crab boil.             Yeah, I got one idea, I'm an idiot. jledden   Done.  Follow back at jledden                                       Not at all like an IED went off in her vagina...lol. Just different. The inner labia were just a bit more meaty. Because of an episiotomy (where they make a small incision in the perenium (taint) to ease birth, the general shape of it changed a small amount. If I wasn't already intimately familiar with my wife's vajayjay, I wouldn't think a second about it; it's still beautiful and attractive; just a little different.   Not if it's the first time you've been with her. The vag changes after children, for sure, but subtly...I saw the difference first hand with the wife before and after; and it's a visual thing, not a tactile thing. It feels the same, it just looks a little different. But first time out with someone new? No way of telling.                  My god, man. I'm so sorry. Persephonee seems like a wonderful girl, I bet she would be so proud of you for deciding to help other people during this time. My heart is just broken for you, bro, just broke.   I hope you don't mind I share one of your posts from [www.caringbridge.com](http://www.caringbridge.org/visit/persephoneebanks/journal/view/id/54ec56f7a589b4c14e96b3d7) that gives some history. I'm sure others want to know, and maybe want to help out too.  Stay strong, man. From what I read in the Journal on CB, I can't believe how strong you're being; probably strong enough that you and Persephonee's mom can hold each other up, and help each other through this. Far stronger than I can imagine myself being...  This is where I would put something that would help you feel better, if I knew at all what to say...   That's a lot of Carlin. I don't know what this is, and I'm not sure why I like it. Maybe because I can hear Heffer saying the Seven Words You Can't Say on TV?                 	194
 Yea - the hyperbole, or outright BS, in that post was impressive.   If Hezbollah could, they would invade Israel.   Highly doubt that - Israel's existence is the political leverage that parties relying on economically dis-empowered people can use to stay in power.  That said, I don't know why you're being downvoted. HA is a threat to Israel. Not an existential threat, but definitely a long-term threat.   Not really, if "nothing happens" and accused terrorists are tried and found guilty before "anything happens", these organizations would look just fine.  Problem is - the only organization with a meaningful record of "thwarted attacks" (the FBI) has constantly been exposed as deliberately entrapping people, re-contextualizing, relying on unreliable sources for false convictions, etc. Meanwhile, what we get from the NSA is massive domestic spying, international spying on allies, while the CIA is busy running black ops toppling democratically elected governments.  Calling for reform isn't an imposition of a catch-22.   Right - because condoning torture by our government is just "a different opinion".  Oh wait, you think China and Russia don't do the same?  Basically: Hey, look over there! They do awful shit. So what if we do awful shit as well.    some fighters in Iraq and syria ,specially in Is are [a] bunch of wanna be soldiers who played too much games   paintball and decided to go there.   FTFY   Well, I've noticed one thing about terrorist leaders - they seem to live a lot more lives then the rest of us. The key to longevity is somewhere in there.  Sucks for the grunts though - never heard of one of those guys coming back from a suicide bombing.    penal colony  Not much worse then one of our prisons making a few cents an hour, getting raped in the US and coming out a more hardened criminal.   Banditry without guns never goes over well.   People's thoughts are generally tied to things that they're being pumped with as part of their daily routine (interactions with others, the media they consume, etc.) These issues will never get the sort of highlighting that the apparent aggressions of our opponents will, or the new Kanye interview will.   That's not how it works, in this country or any others. The most recent example being the child diddlers in the UK government. There is no such thing as karma in the real world.   There are some fundamental oversight issues with the way we do things.   The CIA and NSA are the good guys, sure they treat terrorists like shit but that's part of why I like them.  God - I really hope you're not actually in the Navy. You're a disgrace to all the men and women who serve and believe in being civilized.   I hope that's sarcasm. Because torturing people, meddling in international affairs, creating chaos in relatively stable regions etc. have a direct correlation with "all our childrens" being "blowed up". We've fucked up a lot, but its not irreversible. It requires us to think outside of the box. Like perhaps, not trying to bomb people into submission as that hasn't been mighty effective over the past several years.   /s  You forgot that.   Not everyone was paying attention, and in 2007ish, there was the common denial of this sort of stuff being rogue elements and not an institutional problem. New information about old abuses is good - it helps catch up people who missed it the first several years over or tried to plausibly deny it because we're all about being 'civilized' and what-have-you.   Sadly   They're not investigative journalists, they simply report the material that they've come onto (with the same level of scrutiny you'd expect from a standard news report). Investigative reports, documentaries - the only things short of video recordings - that look into issues take a lot more time, but are often based in part on leaks like these.      Environment         You just posted this - at least give the hasbara trolls a few hours to brigade properly.   the killer himself made a link between his acts and Islam.  No. He didn't. Feel free to provide the non-existent citation.   Go ahead and talk to the CAIR chapter in your local area...which actually documents hate crimes instead of random people in Reddit. In the past year, where I live, there's been 100 cases of reported acts of vandalism, and outright beatings. Reported attacks - I'm personally aware of people who choose not to report the occasional hate-crime (resulting in tangible material loss) for fear of further harassment.  It must be fun having living under a rock.   Pamela Geller, Ayan Hirsi, Fox News. Sorry, yes they are.   Did I say that? I asked you a question about your redefining of a well-known term.  Edit: And for the record, I don't. Muslims who live in the West do so under contract, explicit and implicit, in the gaining of visas or citizenship. Whether you're a born or naturalized citizen, these contracts explicitly demand adherence to local laws.  And even if it wasn't explicitly laid out, these actions have a net negative imposition on every other Muslim living in the region - and no extended benefit for Muslims internationally either as the end result is more money pumped into the war machine for further misguided adventures by our government abroad. The objective of a defensive war in Islam is to repel an invasion, not to invite more.  And these actions also don't accord with Islamic law where even for suriyah or out-right war, the individual participants are required to act under a commander.  And that's assuming that your nonsense of attributing a religious motive to this individual in Chatanooga is actually valid when we have no non-circumstantial evidence to believe it is.   "muh joos cuntrul le werld XDXDXD"  Not a single comment in this thread even implied that fucktard.   Different sub - but holy cow   Yes, it's more serious than a normal dog but no where near the ramifications of a human.   Legally, no. But I can't imagine it won't be a bumpy ride to your cell, or that you won't get James Boyd'ed in the process.   If a civilian attacks legitimate military targets, it's terrorism than? So the private security and other volunteers going into Syria right now to fight IS are also 'terrorists' by your definition?    Terrorists commit terror in name of Islam --,which this guy did   Except that he didn't. There's no proven motive yet.   President Barrack HUSSEIN Obama wishes happy Eid to the Mozlems on eve of horrific ISIS attack on our soil!!11!   Except that no actual IS rep claimed it. An account of a claimed IS fan, with no corroborated or proven connection, claimed responsibility *after the fact*.  Edit: And that random account didn't even claim responsibility. It simply tweeted "Chatanooga" after the fact.   there IS a racial component to the issue  Yeah - that racism is allowed to thrive in some departments is a direct result of the blue wall of silence and police corruption. It's a symptom and not the root cause.   And I wouldn't dismiss the racial **symptom** of it, I'm at the Black Lives Matter rallies. I'm simply saying I don't like the massive re-contextualization of an racial reform issue having to do with *average citizens vs authority* - something I've worked on for years - over the last year. That said, I realize the ship has sailed and that progressive movements will now be focusing primarily on patching up the symptom and not the actual cause, and I'll naturally be part of that struggle as it's better than nothing.   Dunno, but I can think of plenty of unarmed white men who've suffered police brutality and died as a result.   That's not even what I implied. The fact that racism is allowed to thrive in some departments is a direct symptom of the blue wall of silence and police corruption. Root causes of this issue that effect all groups of people. Not the other way around. We're now focus on remedying one of the symptoms and not the actual cause.   It is a race issue if anything is.  That's simply not true. Racism being allowed to thrive in some departments is a direct symptom of the blue wall of silence and police corruption. Not the other way around.   That's not true. Those same people used to rally for white victims of police brutality. Fox brought tons of them out with guns, using their children as human shields, to support the criminals at Bundy ranch.  By re-contextualizing, we've given people who lack the ability to empathize with people different from them, a way to justify their racism as simply being support for law enforcement. And instead of having an issue that affects all of us be reformed, we have half the country (hyperbole) opposed to reform as a result.   Bootlickers are gonna be bootlickers.   Those bootlickers are bootlickers because they are unable, based on their upbringing, to empathize with the black high school drop out. Those same bootlickers were railing in favor of Bundy against the government, and various other white 'criminals' that faced off against cops.  We function in a democracy and need to cater to the lowest common denominator when we push for any sort of reform - if we want it to be universal. And unfortunately, because of the way this conversation has now irreversibly been characterized, instead of average citizen vs authority issue, it's now a black suspect vs white authority issue.   Derailing? I've been documenting police brutality for several years... If anything, the new contextualization derailed from a universal problem. To focus on the more central problems of the blue wall of silence, police corruption, and police abuse isn't victim blaming... Racism being allowed to thrive in some departments is just a symptom of the blue wall of silence, not the cause.   To focus on the more central problems of the blue wall of silence, police corruption, and police abuse. Racism being allowed to thrive in some departments is just a symptom of the blue wall of silence, not the cause.  Then again - it's too late. The issue of police brutality has already been framed into an almost exclusively race-based one by our own movements and media at this point.    The police shoot members of both races, although I agree the blacks suffer from this more.   It's a shame, by turning this into a race issue, people have inadvertently led to more blind support for law enforcement abuses by more conservative voters. When in truth, police brutality is something we are ALL affected by. By making the issue into a race one, we've killed the possibility of reform in some of the places that need it most.   You're getting downvoted, but that's the truth. Saddam kept people in line, and contrary to popular opinion, had Shi'ites and Christians in his government.   I don't pretend to understand what is happening in the Mid East, but to me, it just seems like a long road of endless violence.   I understand what's happening in the Middle East. That's exactly what it is.   At least our military industrial complex will continue pumping away. Too bad for all the people who died and will die in the coming years :(   Here's a Sunni polemicist site (pacifist missionary style):  http://twelvershia.net/  If you read any of the articles, the main difference is entirely theological.  The current issues, that lead to killings on both sides, have nothing to do with theology though. It's an issue of political alignment with political leaders using religious adherants as pawns.  If you go back to the root of the modern violence, you can go back to the Saffavid dynasty when modern Twelver Shi'ism became a major religious group within Islam due to the ethnic cleansing of Iran of the then Sunni majority under Shah Ismail. And again at the Islamic Revolution in Iran when Khomayni created a new concept in Twelver Shi'ism called Waliyat al Faqih - turning Shi'is to a more active politicized, as opposed to Messianic, religion. This in turn meant meddling in foreign affairs (Iran supported rebellions in Iraq and elsewhere), etc. If it had remained a theological dispute - as it was long ago at many points in time, the worst case scenario today would be zealots and missionaries denouncing one another.   Everything coincides with these days over there - as it's a way to taunt your enemy. Saddam Hussein for instance, was executed on the day Sunnis were celebrating Ei'd by the Shi'ite government in Iraq.   Depends on the location and the role. A tenured cop that got promoted can make more in 10 years than the average citizen in mid-level, non-executive management (80-120K).   I feel like stuff like this must happen, though very rarely. We probably just don't hear much about it - like the domestic terrorist who flew a plane into the IRS building.   Their enemies haven't ever played by the rules either. We're not fed that side of the story because then we realize it's not black and white, and there really aren't any "good guys" in this fight. [NSFW](http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=6f2_1404371007)   Even the semi-sane ones know not to be taken prisoner - nobody there is following international law. NSFW links below:  http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=6f2_1404371007  http://np.reddit.com/r/syriancivilwar/comments/2xy9lu/link_to_photo_album_of_those_starved_and_tortured/   That's not true, YPG unlike the Shi'ite army and militias aren't known for torturing prisoners or patrolling with corpses on their vehicles.   This isn't a confirmed figure from a reputable source...just a blog post and Leith has been known to exaggerate in the past...   It's a four year course, Bagdaddy finished in one!   This brings me a lot of comfort. If we are just a computer program there is a chance of an afterlife program.  It shouldn't. If we're just going on the chance that there is an afterlife, there's no reason to believe that it will be in any way a comforting after life. Could be endless physical suffering.   Every account of him from his friends has him described as 'nice if you get to know him', 'introverted', 'not one of the popular kids, but polite', etc. He may have had a small clique of friends, that doesn't mean he's well-adjusted or didn't face the sort of discrimination his sister spoke out against a few years ago.  To have a tongue in cheek joke about discrimination as the defining statement of your high school career is a good indication that at the very least he was familiar with such incidents, if not intimately and personally so. Likewise, his dad was wrongly detained for questioning by the FBI at a point in his life. His siblings worked to tackle Islamaphobia in the region. Everything is indicative of his experience with discrimination.  That said, you can't expect a CNN piece focusing on this single aspect of the kid's development. They'd get crucified for "blaming the victims" for at least a good year before somebody has the wherewithal, greed and motivation to write a book or serious piece about the issue.   They don't need aircraft carriers to be drowned by their enemy...they obviously had to cross the Tigris when they wanted to attack beyond Anbar before they lost Tikrit, not to mention they controlled several dams...   By all accounts, he was a popular kid   Now you're just making shit up. Every account of him from his friends has him described as 'nice **if you get to know him**', 'introverted', 'not one of the popular kids, but polite', etc. He may have had a small clique of friends, that doesn't mean he's well-adjusted or didn't face the sort of discrimination his sister spoke out against a few years ago. He even made a crude joke about discrimination for his heritage as part of his yearbook signature. Well-assimilated kids don't need to do that where assimilation by definition lends to them identifying with the culture they developed in.  Why is it that when you see something like this, your immediate reaction is a classist anti-southerner screed?  Because by all accounts, he was a mal-adjusted kid in a state of inbred Fox News fans.  Not prejudice. Records of anecdotal incidents of discrimination, the sort of rhetoric by popularly elected representatives, and how the majority of districts vote, are all a pretty clear indication of what sort of place TN is with the exception of isolated pockets.   Ding Ding Ding   Except that Fox News quite literally isn't real news. They don't even self-classify as an actual news outlet. It's why they're able to get away with the bullshit they spin.   Nobody said everybody who faces discrimination becomes a terrorist. Same way, not everybody who gets molested as a kid becomes a serial killer. All I pointed out was that these experiences do play a role in the development of antisocial behavior. This is basic psychology. But pretending that past interactions don't shape the future perspectives of people, and boiling complex issues to simple black and White hyperbole would indicate that you don't have the intellectual capacity to have a reasoned discussion on the topic. So I'm out. Have a wonderful life.   I feel like the govt should subsidize hookers for engineering departments, as like a once monthly thing. Would really help clear away bad thoughts and isolation and whatnnot.   Jeez - I can't even imagine being that Boston bomber's sister.   She did. It's not about not knowing him, people change over time. You can tell from his joke in the highschool yearbook that he's probably used to plenty of abuse from authority as a result of his heritage. It's not difficult to see years of being outcast by your peers in bumbfuck TN being a leading cause in your outlook and development.   I know of children under 3 being put on terror watchlists (and later being removed). What you cited means literally nothing, except proving the exact antithetical point to what you're implying by the fact that the man was ultimately removed.   He has a reasonable defense in court, true or not. He saw this car smoking and began filming innocuously. He then considered helping the victims - prompting him to lean into the car. However, you realized the issue was beyond his scope of expertise so he ceased trying to help and simply continued filming.   People often hate on cops, and sure there is a real issue with the blue wall of silence, but what they don't seem to realize is that the real villains are in the legislature.   This isn't even about bad cops. This is about corruption among city officials - which led to these cops, good or bad, quitting. I don't know how anyone can spin it different.   Nah, by getting this unpopular decision out of the way now, they ensure that people won't remember it years down. Democracies have voters with short attention spans and even shorter memories.    I swear politics now days is a game: Get in, make as much money as you can for you and your mates, then retire.  It's always been a game of thrones. The future will be shit, just like the past.   Your MPs rape little children. Haven't seen much striking over that.   It won't be good. You should get local police at wherever you guys do your holiday prayers at.   The people that do, like Russel Brand for instance, have no meaningful role in media or politics.   I would need to see the video - I didn't even realize they had a drowning / det cord ones. But I imagine something similar (you sank our ship, etc.)   "lost" ftfy   Ah - that explains it. They're not being unAmerican, they're just patriotic conscientious objectors. Let's throw away these pitch forks and signs about the 1%    Especially since the Iraq war gained us exactly nothing.  Not true. We got a shit ton of contracts for Boeing, Lockheed Martin, Haliburton, and various other firms that are part of the military industrial complex. We also created quite a few jobs. Not to mention we've led to that region becoming epically fucked and unstable - ergo -  more contracts for our private military companies.  And who knows, maybe 10 years down the road, a puppet government - hopefully less subservient to Iran and more to us - will be kind enough to allow our private civil corporations to rebuild that shithole.   Haaretz is one of the few *reasonable* papers they print in Israel. Everything else is the sort of right-wing drivel and Israeli fear-propaganda you expect people like OP to post.   You won't lose nudity, that can be really profitable for them in the long run. You may/will lose BDSM/rape/bestiality/humiliation/etc. subs.   I wonder what the next big execution thing will be. Pulling people apart? Feeding them alive to hungry feral dogs? They seem to have tried and overdone themselves time and time again.  For the creative ones - They base their executions on the nature of the 'crime' of the person they're executing. So if you're thinking about the Jordanian, he was burnt alive and then burried under rubble because he was accused of being complicit in doing that to 'citizens' of IS as a bomber pilot. Bombs incinerate their victims or cover them in rubble (as apartments get toppled). So I don't think they'll be employing feral dogs anytime soon in their short blip in history.   Nope. In Iraq, the Sunnis and Shi'ites under Saddam weren't racially/ethnically disprate. There were even large tribes with both Sunnis and Shi'ites. The exception was in the mostly Shi'ite South, but you can't tell the difference between somebody from Basra and someone from Tikrit. After the Iranian revolution, and the Iran supported rebellions within Iraq, there obviously wasn't as much cohesion between Sunni Arab and Shi'ites. That said though, 30-40 years of angst isn't going to change generations of common ethnic background - so they still look pretty alike.  Now if you take an Iranian (mostly Shi'ite) and a Pakistani or an Afghan (mostly Sunni), you'll notice huge differences. And in Afghanistan your theory would actually hold since Shi'ism is more the cultural religion of Hazara who are ethnically seperate from the others.   What's funny is that before the media frenzy about ISIS, I had posted videos of everything from torture of Sunnis captured by Shi'ite militias (outright torture celebrated on camera), burning people alive, using corpses as decals on jeeps, etc.  People think ISIS came out of nowhere, or that they're some great evil we need to go out there and defeat. We need to stop fucking around in their deserts, there's no "good guys" out there.       He inherited 40-200m, maybe he lost most of it but he's worth 10 billion now...not everyone can make that happen without getting lucky and making the right business decisions.  He's not worth 10 Bn. Probably not even close to that. Forbes, and countless other parties have contested his claims (in some cases - itemized contestations)   Any proof that he **recently** expressed support for universal healthcare or expanding 'Obamacare'?            What about Aether?   Instituted Urdu over them? Hardly. If you don't have a medium language, Sindhis and Punjabis can't say shit to one another. That Urdu (and English of late) are medium languages is out of requirement of needing *something* to be mutually intelligible to other people in the same damn country.   It's a medium language, how English is in most of the world. Everybody speaks other languages, but they need Urdu/English to communicate with people from other regions.   I disagree. US media is actual shit. Yours is still, like piss or something.   Yes, because rape fixes everything. Let me guess, you're a middle aged white American.   Not really. All it takes is time, and growth. If this kid was kept on a watch and never allowed to make way into Syria, 3 years of simply living in a truly inclusive society (another problem in the UK) - and he could've ended up a productive tax-paying citizen.  He's gonna come out a proper criminal now, he'll still lose the fanaticism, but it won't be a beneficial result for the general populace.   Also totally cool in WA, way before the Supreme Court decision.   Come to Seattle, there's a lot to do till pretty late. Some spots still going till like 5 AM   Fuck yea. Let's secede? We've been carrying all this weight like..   Yep, it fails to be mutual at that point.   Yep, but be careful with that. When they're drunk and they got a pussy, you're getting booked.   It's mutual combat in WA, not a street fight. If one person calls quits, its no longer mutual, so it would be a cheap shot and a basis to argue damages. Of course there's no reason to really believe that happen here.   So I haven't used /r/loans in like a year. I come back and all of a sudden new page w/ improvements. Nice..   Actually, I dont understand what you are saying. Sorry to be dense, but the death of Jesus by crucifixion is established history by historians. Islam denies this. That is all I claimed in my comment.   You said, "Islam rejects that Jesus died on the cross even though this is considered to be a historical fact by scholars."  I'm saying that your statement is disingenuous as there are secular historians who believe that the historical Jesus either never existed, or that the Canonical Gospel accounts of Jesus' life/death aren't relevant to the historical Jesus. If Jesus, as described in the canonical gospels, did not exist - Jesus, as described in the canonical gospels, was not crucified.  Likewise, its disingenuous in that, of the secular scholars who believe in a historical Jesus, there are historians who don't believe he was crucified either. They've proposed other modes of natural death and execution.  Given these two issues, contrasting Islamic and mainstream Christian theology, while saying something is considered to be a "historical fact" "by scholars" carte-blanche isn't reasonable. In the same vein, I can say "[Mainstream] Christianity believes that Jesus rose from the dead even though this is considered a myth by scholars. Islam and [Mainstream] Christianity are very different"  Although evangelicals love making this particular appeal to authority - **it's just not an academically honest thing to bring up - in the context of theology**, and can be easily applied to mainstream Christians - was my point.  Also - side note, one of the principles (rejection) used in the past by some secular historians to conclude that Jesus was likely crucified isn't that strong, particularly in the last 50 or so years - especially with the discovery of Nag Hammadi. The particular Nag Hammadi texts that contradict the crucifixion (btw) are non-Basilidian texts that provide an additional sectarian confirmation of Basilides' theology re:crucifixion (a denial of crucifixion by a subset of early Christians which was known primarily through polemics by Ireneus/Origen/etc. against Basilides).   Islam rejects that Jesus died on the cross even though [the idea that Jesus died in one way or another] ~~this~~ is considered to be a historical fact by ~~scholars~~ [historians who believe Jesus existed].  Christianity teaches that Jesus rose from the dead several days later even though this is considered a historical fabrication by historians who believe Jesus existed.  See what I did there? Relevance of a historians analysis, based on the reality of death in the human experience, on theology...   Let's leave aside that example - there's tons of examples that the Law wasn't temporally universal for the Jews. There are passages where God himself orders people to wipe out entire towns (down to every living thing) and there are other passages where God prohibits taking innocent lives.  Israel was carrying out Gods judgment on specific nations who practiced idolatry, sexual immorality, and child sacrifice, so many innocent lives were already being taken. There were rules that they had to follow. They had to offer the city terms of surrender, so the people knew ahead of time that Israel was coming. Only those who didnt leave were killed. They allowed the Canaanites to assimilate into Israel if they were willing. When Israel practiced the same sins as the other nations, God judged them too.  You don't need to defend the fact that the OT God was ordering genocidal raids against idolators' cities down to every breathing thing, etc. My point was that God not only allowed, but ordered mass killings in certain circumstances. Other times, God changed it to prohibit victimization of the innocent civilians. I'm not bringing up the morality/barbarity associated with something like this - my point was that you object to the idea that * Something is okay one day, and not okay the next * - but the Bible is replete with examples of this. Examples which you have no trouble reconciling in the Bible but find adamantly problematic in Islamic concept of abrogation.  Im not sure what you are trying to show with this link.  The link was a response to what you said: the Quran is supposed to be the next revelation confirming what was revealed before in the Torah and the Gospel.  I was pointing out that this isn't what is intended, but rather confirming (what is true) from what is left of past books and *correcting* what is false from the past books is the objective.  You claim the Quran corrects the previous revelation. Since weve been discussing...  I'll take it than you have no interest in the Qur'anic corrections of Biblical factual errors (as in the link) as you would rather address other items besides that (which is fine)...   marriage/adultery/mutah, was Jesuss teaching on divorce a corruption?  I wouldn't know if Jesus' purported teaching on divorce are a corruption or not. Let's assume that his teachings **to the Children of Israel**, for whom he was sent, were not a corruption.  Considering that Muhammad allowed sex with slaves, sex with captive women while their husbands were still alive... I can only assume that Muhammad was correcting Gods previously corrupted revelation.  Jesus never prohibited either of these things - even in what's remained of the corrupted revelations. Having sex with slaves never fell under adultery for the Old Testament God and Jesus never came along and suggested that it is now adultery or slavery is now abolished (the opposite, slaves ought to obey their masters per Christ's purported disciples - Titus 2/9), or that it has become prohibited as part of his new laws...  and married his adopted sons wife after a divorce  Wouldn't be a problem with Jewish law, though in your hypothetical, if we assume that Jesus' teachings were not just for Jews, but for Gentiles, and that Jesus' teachings prohibit divorce, than it would be problematic. That's two assumptions we don't necessarily buy.  Ummm..it sure did!! In fact, you are commanded to tell me you believe in what has been revealed to me (29:46), not some ghost Christian from around the time of Christ. Will you obey the Quran? As above - [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/islam/comments/2zgomi/where_is_muhammad_mentioned_in_the_bible/cpkdocd)  One of the benefits of having so many manuscripts is we know **no one person** could have tampered with the texts, especially the NT.  Except that they did, unless you're suggesting that ample examples like John 7:53 (onwards) were made by a group of people. This passage, like many other passages, was inserted at some point. For Christians spanning wide physical and temporal regions (literally centuries) - this was canon - they were duped by the surviving MS family into believing that this was a part of the Gospel attributed to John. Until the discoveries of some early John MS' + Sinaiticus (about 200 years ago), etc.  So for centuries, interpolations (such as this one) are able to creep on by *in spite of* the many manuscripts that pre-date these discoveries and improve our understanding of what was actually originally in these texts.  If you're suggesting that no one person alone could've tampered with the text, sure. Instead, many different people with different reasons over different periods of time were able to tamper with the text. And this is just the evidence of tampering in late manuscript families (leading to the widespread propagation of different interpolations which are uncovered only as discoveries are made). There aren't actually any full MS that are contemporary with the purported authors - making early interpolations pretty practicable as well.     No wories.   Whether it is God directly or God through a prophet, Im not sure I understand the difference.  The difference is that in the history of OT, the particular phrase "God will go" was used to mean the selection of a Prophet. It has never, in the history of the OT to my recollection, meant that God Himself arrives in an avatar (Jesus). You can't on the one hand demand Muslims mentioning Isaiah 42 embrace the context of both Proto and Deutro Isaiah while yourself ignoring the context of these Jewish phrases you're re-interpreting to apply to Christ.  In our example (Hosea 2), the the text is clear. It says God will go to the gentiles. From the context of the OT, it implies that God will select a Gentile Prophet. But you're suggesting a revolutionary meaning outside of the OT context, that this time around, the scripture actually means God will himself come down in human form as an *Israelite* and that the *Israelite* will go to the Gentiles. Can you find one single verse in the OT where this phrase is used and *not meant* that God will select a Prophet *from* the group He's "going to"?  Im surprised you would bring this up. Pointing out that a sect does not adhere to the majority has no bearing on what the truth is.  Absolutely does. You don't hold a monopoly over interpretation. The fact that different subsets of Christians, with largely the same canon at this point, are coming to multiple interpretations using the same text implies ambiguity. Ambiguity allows for interpretation (as opposed to one irrevocable interpretation in "truth").  ...  I take my interpretation from Scripture. I cant help if others ignore what Jesus said.   As above. You take your interpretation from your understanding of what you take as scripture. Another person can interpret  your version of the same text to derive that divorce is completely illegal, or that divorce itself is okay, but remarriage is not, etc. The texts are not clear or there wouldn't be such disparity amongst several subsets of the population that have, more or less, the same scripture.   And then if we look at the textual integrity of the verse - given that the MS evidence suggests that "except for fornication" is an interpolation, you open a whole new can of worms (making it clear that divorce is never permitted - contradicting your view which is based on a certain subset of our manuscripts). One of the problems associated with the myriad of "minor" MS discrepancies is that they often effect meaning.  Requiring this is a double standard since there are also varying interpretations of things within Islam.  Requiring what? Islamic law, like Jewish law, is open to varying interpretations. This is intrinsically consistent with what the source texts themselves say about multiple interpretations.  All that being an aside however. The main point you were making (as I gather it) is that it makes sense for Jesus to abrogate some/all of the Law because your reading of Paul's interpretation of these passages is that the laws were prophesied to be cancelled?  I quoted the OT, not Paul.  You quoted Jeremiah 31. That doesn't mean your interpretation of Jeremiah 31 isn't influenced by your reading of Paul's suggestion of 'the law in spirit' and not reading Jeremiah as its own text.  I could qoute the Bahagavad Gita to make a point that no Hindu had ever understood from the passage, and which the context and language of the passage doesn't support based on the later supplemental texts. That doesn't mean its what the Gita implies. But if you find offense to that, we can simplify,  *The main point you were making (as I gather it) is that it makes sense for Jesus to abrogate some/all of the Law because your ~~reading of Paul's~~ interpretation of these passages is that the laws were prophesied to be cancelled?*  There is nothing morally wrong with how someone plants a field of crops or if they mix fabrics, unless someone is doing this in the context of idolatry.   But who are you to decide what is and is not morally wrong though? If you believe in an Objective Morality, you need a fundamental source to fix that morality. If that source is God, than what God says you should do becomes moral, and what God says you shouldn't do becomes immoral. As you say yourself, "Adultery has always been morally wrong, at least according to Christianity **when God set up marriage.**"  You can justify mutah by saying that its not really adultery since they were technically married and Moses also permitted divorce; however, this is where Jesus calls out the Israelites saying that they even though the Israelites were technically following the law, their hearts were far from the things of God.  I'm not justifying mut'ah. It's prohibited.  If Muhammad was a prophet from God, why did his life and Gods newest revelation contradict the prior revelations?  Where's the contradiction? The Christians haven't (re-)discovered Q - and that's assuming Q is even an accurate reflection of Christ's actual teachings. There are no accurate reflections of prior revelation in existence per Islamic text, in spite of the evangelically forced misinterpretation of one or two ayaat, as mentioned to you by someone in a different thread. Edit: [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/islam/comments/2zgomi/where_is_muhammad_mentioned_in_the_bible/cpkdocd)  Jesus was showing what the intention of the law was.  Right, that's semantics. The fact is that he changed the law. Divorce was okay, with OT examples, one day and not okay the next (abrogation). You can say it was just Jewish hypocrisy, but the OT God seemed to lay out a lot of material that suggest that divorce, re-marriage after divorce and polygamy were allowed in more circumstances than just adultery.  [To be continued...]   No, it doesn't. But instead of spouting the tired reductionist BS, why not [actually look into](http://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1cm0t3/original_research_the_mountain_of_evidence_for_a/) and let us know what you find.[2](http://np.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/2zzy13/uk_government_rejects_immunity_for_public/cpnv677) [3](http://np.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/2zzy13/uk_government_rejects_immunity_for_public/cpny2yt)             I heard from people who stayed in the village that [militiamen] were burning down houses, looting and blowing up houses. I went back last week, approximately 10 days ago, because our financial situation is poor and I needed to collect our belongings, especially as winter is coming. When I got there I saw that 99 percent of the houses in my neighborhood were burnt down and nothing was left. While I was there we saw smoke rising from three different places. The smoke was coming from the areas in front of my house, near the main road near the militia offices. The school was burnt down too, and they burnt three [hospital] clinics and four mosques.  This is "liberation" apparently.   No, I'm sorry for being abrasive, I can see where the incorrect assumption would've been made based on the translation.   Alleged mediums are often women and people of color.  Maybe in America. I can't speak for Afghanistan specifically, but in these areas specifically (neighboring Muslim countries), the fortune teller stands are predominantly run by men. Soothsayers in our countries in this region are open about it, it's not something you're accused of and killed for - regardless of whether they're just bogus entrepreneurs. You're applying an American experience (Salem) to a completely different society.   Of course they are, it's extremely naive and arrogant of you to think that there are not people that are unsure that identify as muslims in this subreddit. Having a mature debate about it would be nice, but you are clearly so uncertain in your own belief that you felt intimidated by just the prospect of discussion about it  LOL. Well that escalated quickly. Peace.   It's not about it not being mature. I'd be interested in the topic too, but you need to find someone actually "considering leaving Islam" - and I'm sure they're out there, but the people in this sub (usually Muslims and non-Muslims with substantial interest in Islam) aren't the demographic you're going for.    Old footage mostly.  Exactly what I was thinking. Re-using a bunch of old clips you pushed out before the initiative doesn't really imply a lot of success.   It's not a baby or a fetus falling out of her womb....it's one his two kids that went up to her after she died.....  ...   ...   That's not talking about a fetus falling out of her...it's one of his two children () coming up and getting splashed with some of her blood.    If she is pregnant, yes. But where is this idea of a pregnancy coming from?   a pregnant woman  How the Hell did you get that she was pregnant?   So by your logic we should ignore textual criticism; a secondary document affirming the Trinity, and the progression of Jesus's mission starting with the Jews then the Gentiles?  We were talking about **the textual integrity of a specific verse** you used, not Trinitarian doctrine in general...and your response is to bring up an unrelated issue and defend the unrelated issue...okay...   Here you will find the answer to al-Kheoi  The guy defending Khoi's argument boils down to 'There is a difference b/w plain lying and lying for a cause..' - confirming the fatwa and contradicting your original claim....  The evidence about the absurd nature of your cult - it's distance from the religion sent by Al-Haqq and the garbage you've attributed to the Imams AS, is there for your benefit in both fatawa and ahadith. Being a little honest with yourself won't hurt. Salaam   Sure, I can provide two examples off-hand, the prophecy about the volcanic event in Hijaz and a prophecy about the Mongol Invasion.  Re: the volcanic event, he mentioned that people as far as  Busra will observe the light from it. So he mentioned not only the event - but even the magnitude of the unforeseeable event in no uncertain terms. [This hadith](http://www.sahihmuslim.com/sps/smm/sahihmuslim.cfm?scn=dspchaptersfull BookID=41 ChapterID=1209) is in Sahih Muslim (261 AH) while the event took place around 600 AH.  As for the Mongol invasion, the Prophet explicitly laid out the racial characteristics and even the type of clothing of the invaders. [The hadith (179-180 and other recordings)](http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/hadith/bukhari/052-sbt.php) is in Sahih Bukhari (200 AH) while the event took place in like 650 AH.  One especially remarkable feature, besides the detailed recorded statements about appearance 600 years prior to the event, is that he couldn't possibly know that Islam wouldn't spread to the Mongols - which would've falsified the prophecy (as the tradition implies a non-Muslim army coming in). Muslim armies also had never provoked the Mongols afaik so there was no possibility of self-fulfillment either. The Mongol armies had to stop their infighting, unite, and then succeed against China before progressing to the Muslim empires. We're dumbing it down here - but the level of complexity and the number of variables is pretty out there.   Let me know what statements in particular you'd like a citation for or found to be "a load of BS" - happy to provide any information you need.   I wouldn't know about your lab and I'm not a biologist. My point of reference is popular information about a handful of studies, like the one where they ran a social experiment on mice populations to the point of over-populating a limited space and where the animals began to exhibit abnormal behaviors (until the population ended up dying out).   [Reply 1](http://www.reddit.com/r/islam/comments/198xye/from_the_heart_to_the_heart_a_letter_to_the/c8m8gjq)  We'll tackle this first. My claim is that a central premise of your religion is **lying**, contrary to Islam. That your religious traditions have denigrated the Imams (AS) as nothing but habitual, and **needless liars**. And though the claim of your religion, through your version of the Imamah nonsense, is that the Imams are meant to be guides, they (rather their purported followers) generated more misguidance and confusion than guidance.  The premise of your defense is:  Taqiiya is only done when someone's life is at risk  And then you quote an out-of-context Sunni scholar's explanation of taqiyyah as it would be permissible in Islam, and try to extend his definition to your own cult. This is illogical. Your religion doesn't come from our scholars - if you have a defense of taqiyyah being what you claim it is, that defense should come from your texts. Not to mention that your disingenuous sources deliberately took Waheed uz Zaman's statements out of context.  Here's why I'm confused though, Grey - since I'm actually reading the fatwas of your scholars to learn about your religion - and your ahadith. You keep telling us that taqiyyah is only to save your life, that lying isn't okay otherwise. I agree with you, that is what **Islam teaches**. But it doesn't seem to be what your religion teaches, and it doesn't seem to be what your religious traditions suggest that the Imams RA did.  (1) If that was the case, why did al-Khoi give this fatwa:  He is explicitly allowing Twelvers to lie to Sunnis (or any non-Twelver) in debate if it means the Twelver will win the argument. Can you explain why al-Khoi, a venerated mujtahid of your cult would come to this conclusion while you - an anonymous nobody - has more claim to what is and is not allowed in your religion when practicing taqiyyah? This fatwa, and your claim contradicting it, has really confused me! Was al-Khoi just unaware that you can't do taqiyyah in munazarra?  (2) A similar sentiment is echoed by al Khomayni in his rasael:                [and again:]               He is explicitly allowing Twelvers, in one of the permissible types of taqiyyah, to lie in order to trick Sunnis simply so that Sunnis will be drawn in. This is not preservation of life and limb - it's outright deceit.  (3) A similar fatwa from as-Shirazi explaining how taqiyyah IS NOT what you're claiming it to be and IS allowed even without threat to life - but just to spread your cult (from Qawaid al Fiqhiya):                                           .              Over and over, I'm finding your major scholars permitting taqiyyah without fear of loss. Maybe you can clarify the statements above?  (4) I have some copy-pasta of my own from when I began to learn about your religion. [Shiachat thread](http://www.shiachat.com/forum/topic/234993616-ameen-after-fatiha/page-2). The people there are generally more knowledgable about their cult than most people on Reddit so I'll add details I omitted + clarification here. Imam told his followers to say Ameen out-loud after fatiha (hadith saheeh):      (   )           :    :       As you know however, in your religion there is no 'Ameen' after the Fatiha. And your books have saheeh traditions which suggest that you not only don't need to, but should NOT say 'Ameen' after the fatiha. The contradiction is easily resolved though. The Imam in one case is doing taqiyyah, and in the other case, he's telling the truth in secret to his Shi'a. Fair enough.  My issue however is that your definition of taqiyyah only allows people to lie when their life is threatened. This means that the Imam's life must've been threatened.  Here's the problem with that theory. In Sunni fiqh, there are different opinions on the Ameen. We all say it, but some say it out-loud (like Hanbalis) while others say it silently (like Hanafis). The Imam was in Hanafi territory. If he feared for his life, why did his false fatwa in taqiyyah match the fiqh position of non-Hanafis? This fatwa from the Imam, and your claim contradicting it, has really confused me! Was the Imam just unaware that you can't do taqiyyah except when your life is threatened? Why is the Imam misguiding us?  (5) And speaking of misguidance + useless lying, maybe you can explain this sahih hadith from al-Kafi to me:                          :                            :                      :   !                   . :      :               :    .  If taqiyyah is out of fear of life or limb, why is the Imam giving us **three unique fatwas (2 lies, 1 correct fatwa)**? The Imam explains that its better to confuse people so they don't rely on one another... is this what you've denigrated the holy progeny (AS) to? Absolutely repulsive. As an aside, your religion teaches us that we need Imamah so that we have **guides** who will explain the religion. If the Imams were such habitual liars who caused deliberate confusion, doesn't it kinda kill the whole purpose of Imamah?  --- I would like an absolute consensus on this issue, like how there is in shunning terrorism, or anything major like this.  This is not a major issue. The fact that your cult is sizable is a modern phenomenom. In spite of this, prominent scholars have already commented on the Imami religions that came well before your version was popularized...  Whatever happened to facing consequences like a man, guessing Wahhabis aren't blessed with this basic trait.  No, I guess they haven't. They learned from the best though. Your imaginary cave-boy Mahdi taught them that key to longevity is hiding...  honestly it makes your Sahaba (as per your history, **not my opinion**, nor my claim)  No reason to mince your words, this thread is old enough that nobody else will see it...  As for reading your copy-paste (which is just copy-pasta from AA - I was silly enough to hope for something original and unaddressed), I did, and I'd be happy to address the unrelated parts re:Uthman once you've clarified my misunderstandings about the basis of your religion: Lying.   So if you can kill animals in order to eat meat and make tents, i.e., to benefit a handful of people, then a priori, you can kill animals in order to benefit an entire population of people.   Killing animals isn't the same as torture. And if we're real about - a lot of these experiments are torture - and some of the things that bring us "progress" are outright disgusting.    It kind of sounds like you're putting limits on God's mercy.   Ultimately, it is up to God and we'll never know what's in somebody's heart. But as a general rule, the texts are clear that Islam is the only religion excepted. I agree with what you're implying - we can't truly fathom the extent of God's mercy and what He'll treat as the 'mustard seed of iman' - but we know what the general statement is (and in turn - the importance of dawah).   Whoa there bro! Can you be any more biased in explaining the sunni viewpoint? You didn't even make an attempt at explaining it. A naive reader will read your post and think that sunnis believe Allah (swt) has hands and feet like humans, Audubillah.   The most amusing part of that statement is the reality that tajseem was introduced to Muslims through Hisham b al-Hakim, an Imami Shi'ite. Twelvers may have taken a more Mutazilli route over the years, but there's a good bit of irony there to chuckle at.   For me, it's prophecy. I just can't explain away bounds of clear-cut Prophet statements that were put to paper before the events took place. I'm not talking Nostradamus style prophecy, or how Christians contort symbolic OT verses into prophecies about Jesus - I'm not talking about self-fulfilling prophecies - but like, real, literal prophetic statements - many times many years into the future. Falsifiable statements that a false prophet would never have made.   My premise is more like if a Sunni and Shia Muslim lived together for 2 years in a college dorm, what differences would they notice day to day?  If you want to know basic differences in fiqh - you'll want to pick a comparative fiqh primer. I would suggest this one:  http://www.amazon.com/Islamic-Jurisprudence-According-Sunni-Schools/dp/1887752978  And then for Imami fiqh, I would recommend man la yadhurul faqih (you'll need to understand Arabic). This is technically a hadith book (since Shi'ites consider the words of an Imam as a hadith) but it's designed as a fiqh book. If you read them comparatively, you'll notice that Imami Shi'ites often have contradictory authentic traditions (like in nikah al mut'a or saying ameen after fatiha) where one matches a popular Sunni opinion and another is aberrant. The general logic is that the aberrant opinion is the correct one for Shi'ites and the one that matches Sunnis was said by the Imam in taqiyyah.  If you speak Urdu - which I gather from your post, see if you can find a comparative fiqh book by Mufti Abdul Kareem Mushtaq. I haven't read it so I can't comment on the content, but my understanding is he compares the majority opinion in the four madhahib of Sunnis and the major opinions of Twelver Shi'ites.  There are tons of differences though you'll notice in the minutiae if you're both religious. The basis of Imami Shi'ism was to be anti-thetical to whatever the 'aam (majority) were doing. In the case of fiqh, this translated to doing the opposite of the major school of Sunni fiqh in your city - and that became the basis for the narrations that Imamis have in their books which aren't found in the books of traditional Islamic sects (Sunnis, Zaydi Shi'ites, Ibadis, etc.)  As an example, Hur Amili said:                 **           **  Basically, Sunni scholars were so misguided by Shaitan that it became a rule in Twelver Shi'ism to simply do the opposite of what the Sunnis did.  Hopefully that helps in whatever you're trying to study.   If it wouldn't be considered effeminate in your culture and among the people you surround yourself with, there shouldn't be a problem. One of the sons of Imam Ahmed had his ears pierced (as per their culture). Where/when I was growing up, you did that if you were a homo. Now, it's normal. It's all relative.   You can work work on your reading comprehension brother. We were talking about this verse in the context of Jesus telling his disciples to baptize all nations (gentiles). Here's how you used it:  "Jesus's commandment to "Go out and Baptize all nations in the name of the Father, Son, Holy Spirit." Was meant for all. Jesus commanded His disciples to treat the Gentiles, and the entire world."  This contradicts other statements which /u/g3t_re4l quoted you in which Jesus makes it abundently clear that he came solely for the Children of Israel and also conflicts with the Hebrew manuscript tradition for Matthew.  I mentioned the trinity and the baptism part off-hand so it's a shame you feel the need to focus on a tertiary issue rather than the relevant point. I also didn't say anything about the trinity in general, but as it pertains to **this particular verse**. In this verse, it's a widely recognized interpolation - a shallow reference to a non-canonical text doesn't dismiss that.    Jesus's commandment to "Go out and Baptize all nations in the name of the Father, Son, Holy Spirit."  Besides the fact that this ayah contradicts the other statements in Matthew that /u/g3t_re4l pointed out, it also suffered extensive interpolation. Within the standard Greek text, the trinity isn't even mentioned in the earliest sources. And in the Hebrew text, that entire statement of going to Gentiles doesn't exist.   Don't know what Hasan Sahih means, but I'm gonna take an educated guess and assume that it means better than good, but not quite authentic.  It depends on the scholars. This was used by our earlier scholars and they used it differently.  Not quite sure what Sahih in chain means. Don't know what Da'if in chain means  That means the muhaqiq only graded the sanad and has no comment on the matn. The matn could have gharib wording.   If there was a mob in the centre of Mecca complaining about some Islamic thing, it would be obvious that the mob is Muslim. If there's a mob in the centre of a Christian district, expressing anger in the immediate after-math of church bombings and lack of security - it's pretty obvious that the mob is Christian...    In Jeremiah 31, it says that a new covenant is coming were God will write his law on the hearts of his people.   I know the context with which most modern Christians understand it. That said, when I read this - I see God saying his new covenant will be with a people who are very devout (His law is in their heart - meaning they keep the law very well, in contrast to those who broke it). By the context itself, Jeremiah is juxtaposing it with the assertion of how these two covenants are different in the preceding verse (one was broken by the people, the other one will be in their hearts/minds - meaning it won't be broken). That said, I'm not wholly convinced in the reliability of the Masoretic Yirmiyahu anyways given the extremely substantial differences in our earliest text (LXX).  In Hosea 2, it says God will go to the Gentiles, they will become his people, and they will accept him as God.  When God says he will go to the non-Israelites, does He mean he will go thru an Israelite (Jesus) and then an Israelite will go to the Gentiles, or that He will go to the Gentiles? In every verse I can think of where God says "I go to" or "I will go to" in Tanakh or the Nevi'im, God selects a prophet from amongst them (as the meaning of 'I will go to them'). Moreover, if in Hosea 2 God didn't mean he will send a Prophet among Gentiles, but would come through an Israelite, then the verse loses its substance as the chapter begins by first renouncing the status of Bani Yisrael as a Chosen People at the time when this event would take place.  When Christ fulfilled the old covenant that Israel broke, the new covenant came to the Gentiles. There was no longer a need to physically separate oneself from the other nations by the outward appearance. Instead, the separation is to be seen by the change in a persons heart and how they treat others.  Sure, that is your understanding of the verse. But if you've ever met an Ethiopian Christian, you'll notice they won't eat pork but they will eat other meat without keeping the Law of slaughter. Not every Christian sect interpreted Jesus as cancelling all the laws, just some of them. Pauline Christians (like yourself) differ in how you understand the cancellation, or the reason behind the laws.  All that being an aside however. The main point you were making (as I gather it) is that it makes sense for Jesus to abrogate some/all of the Law because your reading of Paul's interpretation of these passages is that the laws were prophesied to be cancelled? Ergo, **God saying** he will cancel some laws is justification for "how something can be fine on one day and then a sin on the next day". If that's the case though, Islamic theology surrounding the abrogation of laws is also wholly internally compatible. As Muslims believe God Himself said some laws/covenants will be adjusted later as well.  Divorce was and still is allowed, but this does not mean there was or is no sin in the matter. There are two parties involved in a marriage and if one of those parties breaks the vow through adultery, the other party is permitted to divorce without committing a sin. There is still a sin that was committed that lead to the divorce.   As I said, *some Christians*. Your interpretation may allow divorce, many early Church fathers forbade it, many other Christians allow it without considering it a sin and others allowed it while considering it a sin. The Catholics will say it isn't allowed at all and play semantics to annul marriages, the Copts will say that it is only allowed in the case of adultery, etc. My point was though that *the law changed*. For the Jews, divorce was usually discouraged but never forbidden while Christians developed different laws around it based on the understanding of what Jesus meant.  I believe in an objective moral law for all people, so just because something was normal in a culture does not mean it was not a sin....What does the law was abrogated mean in this context?  For God to allow this thing - even order Abraham to do it - implies that it did not violate the law to which Abraham was subject - right? Regardless of Abraham's God being more merciful than the polytheistic gods - he did order it. Abraham also proved his faith in his willingness to carry it out. Abraham had no reason to believe God would save the child, and since *God* told him to do it, Abraham had no reason to believe it was immoral or a sin.  Let's leave aside that example - there's tons of examples that the Law wasn't temporally universal for the Jews. There are passages where God himself orders people to wipe out entire towns (down to every living thing) and there are other passages where God prohibits taking innocent lives. Either God is ordering people to commit a sin in one case (which is illogical since God would be the basis of a set of morals being 'objective') - or divine law/morals were subject to change over time/place/circumstance. Likewise the laws associated with Temple Judaism became defunct when the temple was demolished. King Solomon and other Prophets practiced polygamy and kept concubines vs the monogamy espoused by most Christians today, etc.  --  I agree that the laws didnt all come at once, but the Quran is supposed to be the next revelation confirming what was revealed before in the Torah and Gospel. Extra-marital sex as a sin was already revealed before the Quran. Divorce without adultery as a sin was already revealed before the Quran.   Re: Confirming what came before, it means the stories (by confirming [and correcting them](http://www.islamic-awareness.org/Quran/Contrad/External/josephdetail.html)). The Qur'an isn't confirming the Biblical texts themselves as being true - as even extant texts/traditions don't (and didn't) agree with one another. The Qur'an also isn't confirming the old Laws, since it comes with a brand new Law/Covenant that abrogates any old laws. And the Qur'an isn't being revealed to just Jews and Christians, but to all people. Not every group in or around Arabia had the same law. This is a time when people were following one of many Pagan traditions, Mandeanism, Manicheanism, Zoroastrianism, different forms of Christianity, of Judaism, etc. People also had different laws, as the Prophets that God would've sent in India or China didn't come down with all the same stuff as the Prophets God sent to the Israelites (besides Monotheistic theology) - as per Islam, and other people designed laws without any prophetic guidance at all, etc.  The Hadiths seem to indicate that the men recognized they could not just go off and have sex with the local women, since they made the observation that their women/wives were not with them. This tells me they knew adultery was a sin and created a new form of marriage to get around it. Whats the difference between this a prostitution? Im sure you have heard the saying, A rose by any other name would smell as sweet.  Well, they didn't create mut'a, it existed in Arabia before Islam, and it existed among Jews even before that (as the Sages did it - I would imagine they certainly didn't consider it contravening the Laws of marriage or falling under prostitution). The main thing about prostitution that makes it prostitution isn't the term limit imo.   The idea of monotheism is rather new  That isn't really a provable statement. Anthropologists are led to that assumption by the fact that there are early examples of possible idols, and the hypothesis is that monotheism arose from attempts to consolidate a myriad of Gods. The issue with the hypothesis however is that in Monotheistic, and Pantheistic, traditions, the top-God (or only God) isn't generally represented with idols. So anthropologists have really nothing to work with here as original monotheism vs original polytheism isn't exactly provable through artifacts. Looking just at the archeaological record though completely ignores the strange coincidence that the many polytheistic cultures seem to often have an overarching top-God.    I dont understand how something can be fine on one day and then a sin on the next day.  Before Christ (AS), eating unblessed meat was prohibited, after Christ it became allowed according to some Christians. Before Christ (AS), divorce was permitted while after him it became disallowed by some Christians. In the time of Adam (AS), incest was logically not prohibited - after Adam at some point, incest is prohibited. Before God commanded Abraham to kill his son, killing wasn't exactly something good. The law was abrogated and Abraham's act was not a sin by divine revelation (regardless that he didn't get to complete it). etc. Within Moses' on time - its really not plausible that the entirety of the tanakh *and* the entirety of the oral law came all at once either.  You can see laws revealed in time even then till Abraham. So you have effectively the same thing if you believe in the Old Testament, the Oral laws, or the different traditions of . The laws stipulated in different books didn't come all at once - as revelation progressed, laws were adapted besides the core and besides the essence of the theology (One God - existing outside of matter). If you believe, as Muslims, that God didn't only send prophets to Bani Israel, then there were laws in other parts of the world as well - and remnants of those likely exist in other religious/cultural traditions.  And even with the laws - there are differences of opinion since the beginning and different understandings between the early Jewish Sages till today. The concept of difference of opinion is more enshrined in Islam since the Prophet allowed people who were with him to have a varied understanding in a number of traditions, as well as Qur'anic reference to past Prophets.  So - in much the same way, Islam as it pertains to law wasn't revealed all at once. It's not easy for people to do a complete 100% about-face in their life. There was no Shari' law when the revelation first came down - and then ~500 legal verses came over time. People were directed to things according to the Prophetic methodology by order of importance (which still ultimately exists when Islam spreads today):  When the Prophet () sent Mu`adh to Yemen, he said to him, "You are going to a nation from the people of the Scripture, so let the first thing to which you will invite them, be the Tauhid of Allah. If they learn that, tell them that Allah has enjoined on them, five prayers to be offered in one day and one night. And if they pray, tell them that Allah has enjoined on them Zakat of their properties and it is to be taken from the rich among them and given to the poor. And if they agree to that, then take from them Zakat but avoid the best property of the people."  Ultimately though, laws and sins aren't the essence of the religion. The fundamental premise (tawhid - Oneness of God) is what matters more than anything.   If you check the narration you cited, you'll see this part:  'Abdullah then recited this verse: 'Those who believe do not make unlawful the good things which Allah has made lawful for you, and do not transgress. Allah does not like trangressers" (al-Qur'an, v. 87)  This is commentary of the Sahabi and not part of the matn of the actual prophetic saying. In a lot of ahadith, a companion might add elucidation as to his understanding, but the correct understanding is not necessarily what one particular companion, or one particular scholar understood regarding a verse. If you want a detailed explanation of an ayah, you'll need to check tafasir where the various opinions are mentioned as well as the opinion of the jama' (majority) or where a companion will change their understanding based on evidence.  Some companions, for instance, did not know that alcohol was prohibited. So they were drinking in Syria - but when the information arrived, they changed their opinion on it.   |What happened was **absolutely terrible**. That said, if r/Islam needs to condemn shit every times some dumb ass Muslim commits a crime, we won't have time to do much else.  |Though what happened at the churches was abhorrent, the two innocent (until proven guilty) Muslims lynched by the angry Christian mobs and then burnt also deserve our condolences and these mobs our condemnation in the same vein. Right after the apparent suicide bombings, these guys caught in the wrong place at the wrong time immediately had the mob's "justice" unleashed on them and the mob re-snatched from the police who tried to rescue them.  |The group that claimed responsibility for this event is Jamaat ul Ahrar. Jamaat ul Ahrar, not Taliban in Afghanistan, not Tehreek-e-Taliban in Pakistan. Jamaat ul Ahrar was a completely new organization led by Abdul Wali. Abdul Wali (or Omar Khorasani) was accused by Tehreek e Taliban and other such groups as being a proper wacko - and doing things they didn't accept (and since then, TTP has been catching the blame for his shenanigans regardless because of the nature of politics/media).  This includes the recent attack on the Pakistani school where several youth were murdered in cold blood - which happened conveniently *right after* TTP and Pak Govt finally got into peace talks. Those peace talks were some of the biggest breakthroughs in redressing the concerns of the tribes without bombing them into the ground, and creating more angry Pakistanis killing Pakistanis, that we've had in a long time. All ruined by a disavowed off-shoot group that conveniently shoots up a school and reignites the war.  It also includes violence he oversaw when he lead Ahrar ul Hind while breaking cease-fires. Same exact shit. Everybody is finally talking peace, and he conveniently goes back and prevents peace from ever being attainable.  And now - his group (Jamaat ul Ahrar) allegedly claimed responsibility for this horrific event *right after* conveniently rejoining TTP a few days ago! TTP and others likely didn't even know about it, and this small outfit will once again ignite the continued strife in that region as opposed the reconciliation talks that the vast majority of people on all sides want.  What's going on over there right now is a lot more complicated, and a lot less black and white then people think. So without minimizing the suffering of the dead, and the loss of their loved ones, just wanted to get some facts out there.   From what I got, the mob was Christian mob was pounding on two men, *then* the police tried to rescue them, *and then* the mob retook and eventually murdered the men, lynching them and burning them.   Unreliable source...  The guy may be nuts, but he won't be saying shit like this. This sort of shit would push away his base.   This was not TTP, it's the new supposed spin-off JA...   It's important that the government deals with this appropriately, and through legal channels. We can't be having any of this sort of shit:  The crowd also attacked two men it accused of involvement in the explosions, killing both of them.   The mob lynchings and violence that will follow this will only exacerbate the situation. :(   Before getting your jimmies in a bunch, check the source. This is an important issue for public debate but let's get some real journalism here.  	145
 That must be it, everytime i have always wanted to download any dlc for driveclub after I have opened the app, it doesn't work.    Well thankfully in the opening credits of any Bond film we never see the singer actually performing.    Personally I actually really loved [Skyfall](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4gdhsVKTcs) but there are tons of classics, Casino Royale also had a great opening which felt very much in line with the theme of the film. The Brosnan era had some great ones as well apart from Die Another Day. Which ones do you guys rate?    I think the 10 may have been built for the film, since they go through a few cars while filming.    So on more than a few occasions my PSN store will never load, nor will any of the content under any of the games I own. The only way to fix this is to restart/standby my PS4 and go instantly into the store as soon as I log into my account. Anyway to fix this permanently as it's really annoying.    Konami?? iD software made rage and Bethesda published it.   So that's what happened with his title he was working on. Pretty crazy to see that Ubisoft essentially bought it and told him to gtfo.    So far the best new shows of the year for me are Mr Robot, Better Call Saul and Daredevil.    Thanks!!   Hey guys, does anyone know the song that's playing in the background of the scene where Frank is at the bar in the nightclub and notices his wife walking into the backroom?    Probably pre-paid cards which can be used online. There are other ways of paying for services without using your CC.    I remember hearing a fox exec turning down a james cameron/ridley scott alien project for avp.    "They don't get enough love".  lol    Dont regret buying the console at all but the only game I regret buying is Destiny. Me and my friend played it for maybe 10 hours and gave up.   If you have the season pass then no, if not then yes. I recommend getting the season pass though, such awesome value for content.    Imagine if Driveclub slowly evolves into Motorstorm 0_o, but seriously imagine Motorstorm with driveclub's weather system.    It is    Chris Columbus   Really? While Chris is a competent director I feel that he would lack the vision a Bond film needs.    I know a lot of people hated the film but I loved it. [This scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMuAqBo2K6Q) in Chappie where he gets bullied kind of made my eyes water a bit.    Yeah it's a strange one, I guess that it's a lot harder to port the HD collection over since it would look extremely dated on the PS4 more so than the PS3 and would essentially require you to remake the game. Also GoW 1 and 2 are on PS Now right?    Yeah that door shut did look amazing, then ubisoft did the classic downgrade and people aren't as impressed anymore haha   Trailer in November.    Thought you guys may enjoy this read, their way of development reminds me very much of Naughty Dog, it also goes into the challenges faced for PS4 development.       How is everyone liking the new Chem Bros album?   Tomorrowland bombed and Disney got scared to they canned it:(   Eh I dunno if I agree with Divergent being on there since it had every dystopia cliche imaginable and didn't use them well either.    Song is [Icarus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n07RJW2BEBc) by Michael McCann from Deus Ex: Human Revolution.    Good news, also means that they seem to be fairly confident in their remaster.       Haha yeah, it was all memory going up that straight.   Man I would love for Michael Mann to direct season 3. It would be right up his alley and you know that the gunplay is going to be on point.    She's a clone.       The pilot was great, definitely keen on the series.   I thought so at least. They only did the freeze frame in one episode in Season 1 correct? Perhaps that's there way of signifying a big cliff hanger ending.    Now we know why they didn't show much of it in the first trailer.    Me too bud, we can be mediocre together!   Looks fun put me down as Mclaren please!   Yeesh looks like a launch PS3/360 game.    I feel that Gattaca might be very relevant in the next few years.    This is more of a Fox thing, not a Marvel deal.    I wish this track was on the standard release, i'll never understand why they release different tracks in different regions/mediums.    Probably the most effective footwear to have on in combat.    I seem to have misled everyone here by using the actual title of the video, I apologise for those I have hurt during this process.   For you.   Does anyone know what language Tyrell and the pregnant woman (his wife I assume) are speaking?   Yeah that house looked fucking dope. I love the big metal warehouse like door.    Agree, every other sub for tv shows do it.       Dirty Mike and the boys at it again, classic.    This game really deserves a sequel, I heard it sold pretty well so hopefully it happens. The game really picks up on the airship imo. Also the voice acting was fucking phenomenal.    The music and visuals during the [World Engine Scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSjI7gwuKtg) were also amazing as well.    While I do love the Marvel films a lot, the soundtracks are definitely the weakest aspects of their films. While MoS wasn't an amazing film, the soundtrack definitely helped carry the film in my opinion.    [here you go m8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovqM72em1dA)   I would say Drake looked a bit too perfect in the previous uncharted games, he looks more realistic in UC4 and less plasticky looking.   How was it? Sorry if it's an extremely broad question.    Even though they won't bring back the character of Kyle, they can certainly introduce his characteristics into a new character.    I enjoyed the film for what it was and hated it for what it could have been :(   I thought the pacing in the film was so off, just in terms of how they get from point A-B on the short timespan they have.    why are so many drivers exceeding the track limit on that particular turn?    gg mclaren   This track has been growing on me after a few listens, it's different to their usual stuff since Alice is gone but different doesn't mean bad.      Also, it has one of the worst UI's i've ever seen.  Really? I think it's one of the most intuitive UI's I have seen in a racing game. Easy to navigate and it remembers your previous selections so you don't have to mess around selecting what you wanted again. Also the addition of pressing the HOME button to go back to the base menu is a function every game should have.     It's a lot, I bought the full game at launch, and shortly got the season pass (which is amazing value). The full game adds a lot more cars, especially since they have released quite a few cars for free as well and then full game also has 5 more locations (Norway, Japan, Scotland, Canada and Chile). IMO it's worth getting it since I hear its pretty cheap now as well.       To be fair Google Music at least lets you upload 10k songs to your account to listen whenever and wherever you want.   Definitely a cyberpunk blade runner style rooftop, smoking a cigarette haha   One the 50/50 subreddit, this [gif](http://gfycat.com/AcademicRapidFanworms) of an ISIS member getting beaten up came up, is there a video for it?    Marketing. I didn't really see any adverts anywhere for that movie.    How does one even determine what is the "best" of all time, isn't it all subjective?   Not allowed to drink at your own 21st because of your judgemental grandmother? What a negative Nancy.    I really hope RAD get the chance to make a sequel, the game was really getting good towards the end!    The framerate is a locked 30FPS without a single drop and the controls are super tight, perhaps that's why you don't notice the lack of 60fps   Possible to get a quick run down on how to install this?   I'm afraid I can't do that.    Aren't there less than 10 of these in the world? Why would one of them be used a cop car?   I have the DVD of these films, they are all awesome. Each director has a really cool and unique spin on the series. One of my faves is [Ambush](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BsWXkuyIdoY) directed by John Frankenheimer and  [Hostage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSCPRNeVuLk) directed by John Woo.    You haven't even played the game...   I tuned the fuck out when the woman came on stage to talk about mobile games and when this minion fuckery was on stage, one thing to remember though their conference is just as much for fans as it is their shareholders.    It's a fully armed and operational racing game.    Yeah vivid is awesome from a distance haha, not worth the crowds to go see it up close in my opinion.         Piers, haha classic.    The Bond box set on blu ray is one of the best purchases I have made in a while.    I agree, he felt way too old for the role, when I was younger I thought he was entertaining but as I got older it felt like he was just physically out of his depth.    Can you blame them though...   Man it's being really tough being a McLaren fan these days, hopefully the trouble will be worth it this year.       Love it, very Studio Ghibli like!   I use it all the time since I commute on a highway most days. It's really easy to set up on my car, since it's all face buttons on the steering wheel, also it automatically brakes/accelerates when driving up or down hills.    I think God of War 2 and MGS 3 were all pretty amazing as well, you can tell they were squeezing the PS2 to the limit.    Yeah I agree, they should have just included it in the initial blu ray release instead of trying to get people to double dip.     is like when I find out StarFox was called StarWing in Europe  Huh it was called Lylat Wars here in Australia, thought Europe shared the same name.    This glitch man haha, i'm actually impressed that the characters lips sync everytime he says SHAUN, I thought it would have only been a voice over.    Not a video, they had a backup console. Here's a [tweet](https://twitter.com/bruce_straley/status/610644415409815552) from Bruce Straley (guy playing the demo).   Hmm some MKV's work perfectly fine while others just don't play for whatever reason. Some will play but won't let me skip through the video. A step in the right direction for DLNA but it seems that it needs to have some work done first.    Pretty sure cinevia is only on Sony titled movies right?   No doubt, I would love to see them as well!   And then be replaced by "Lancers, WRX's, Skylines, Supras, RX7's".    Not to mention that Sony were selling them at a massive loss as well for the first few years of the PS3.    It will but they will all be unsuccessful because they are not the Jurassic franchise.    You can press up on the d-pad to cycle to the specific camera set which includes the side views, front views and this view. You can cycle between these using R1 and they stay on that angle without switching.    Yep its replay   MclarenF1 LM GTR   Hey guys so I tried something different and recorded this entirely from the alternate cockpit angle to give a different sense of speed, also if anyone is keen on the track/weather settings they are as follows:  Munnar (Forward) Time: 18:30x15 or 30 Weather: Dynamic      I would say try and give it a shot because it gets a lot better around episode 4.   I really loved it, it has some flaws but to be honest it seems to me that the Wachowski's go all in on a project, and they are the most ambitious bunch in film/tv (in my opinion). I'd rather see ambitious albeit flawed attempts rather than safe but good attempts.    Did they ever officially release this track, I want it badly!      **Sense8** So the reviews for this show have been fairly divisive but I am currently on episode 11 and the show has been getting really good in my opinion, the first few episodes are very exposition heavy as they are setting up a rather complex scenario but once that is all out of the way it really gets flowing. Really strange that the show went from 8+ on imdb down to around low 7s and then went back up to 8+, I am guessing that people felt the show picked up and got better as well?    They all look like characters from Oblivion.    How long is this supposed to be set after JP1, because surely someone would have gotten the canister in that space of time instead of waiting long enough that the UN had to ban cloning.    I would say its a bit of both, more so 3 but not in a bad way.    I have a feeling that the actual base game will be completely free for PS+ minus any DLC.   how can you live with yourself?   Crazy that Adam "#dealwithit" Orth is behind this game, glad to see he turned a rather negative experience into a possible positive one.    Actually this is what I should have referenced, Daredevil is still part of the MCU but is much much darker than the films.    So do you guys/gals think that we'll ever see a mature rated Star Wars television series? It doesn't have to be mature in terms of violence but perhaps with much more heavier/serious adult themes instead that aren't really tackled in the films all that much. I remember hearing about the cancelled Star Wars Underworld series which was in development before Disney bought Lucasfilm which revolved around the Coruscant underworld, sounded amazing in my opinion. Imagine if HBO were allowed to develop a Star Wars series *drools*.    Kinda funny that in the John Carter film people were reminded of Geonosis in the arena scene, when techincally it should be the other way around.   	121
          FYI - I'm building the website myself and I am not using a content management system like wordpress.   Rosberg is 1.5 inches taller than Hamilton - how long would that save Hamilton in a qualifying lap?   Name: **Food Finder**  Website: **[foodfinder.io](http://www.foodfinder.io)**  I have made a restaurant recommendation website. I know what you're thinking...not another one!?!.  I'm hoping this will be a little different. I want to create an amazing user experience and I want to only feature excellent restaurants. To do this I'm working on creating a very strong food community.  In the meantime, it would be great if I could get some feedback on user experience.  Website: [foodfinder.io](http://www.foodfinder.io)   Thanks! It's just a bunch of hacked together Javascript and boring old css/html   **Name:** **[Food Finder](http://www.foodfinder.io/)**   **Website:** [www.foodfinder.io](http://www.foodfinder.io/)     **Elevator Pitch:** Helping foodies find and share amazing restaurants in London.  We want to make it ridiculously easy for foodies to find and share great food. We are going to achieve this by creating an amazing user experience and providing the very best restaurant recommendations.  We're not focused on commissions or advertising which means we can work relentlessly to provide an amazing platform for the foodie community.   **Looking for:** As much feedback as we can get our hands on!  **Background:** I am a venture capitalist, physicists and weekend entrepreneur. I originally started [Food Finder](http://www.foodfinder.io) as a small side-project as my friends and I love food but we were not satisfied with the existing restaurant discovery websites. Since then the website has grown to include hundreds of amazing restaurants around London. I now want to continue to grow the foodie community and improve the user experience. Which is why I would love as much feedback as possible!   Thanks to feedback from the entrepreneur subreddit my latest startup - [FoodFinder.io](http://www.foodfinder.io) is looking great with a much improved user experience.  Thank a lot people!  Joe   Website: [FoodFinder.io](http://www.foodfinder.io)   Cheers Sev,  People have been really positive and the site is starting to get quite good traction in London. I'm going to keep working hard and listening to all the feedback I can get my hands on. Then I'll expand it to another city and bring some people on board in a more formal capacity.  I'll keep you updated!      **[www.FoodFinder.io](http://www.foodfinder.io)**   I've just released [Food Finder](http://www.foodfinder.io) into an incredibly crowded space. There are a couple of things I want to achieve with [Food Finder](http://www.foodfinder.io) to make it different to the competition.   They are:  * Every restaurant on [Food Finder](http://www.foodfinder.io) needs to be amazing  * [Food Finder](http://www.foodfinder.io) will be powered by the foodie community by enabling users to post great restaurants to the site  * I want to make an incredible user experience similar to City Mapper where things are simple and just work.  There's still quite a way to go and [Food Finder](http://www.foodfinder.io) has only been released in London so far but I'd love your feedback on the user experience.    Thanks,  Joe   Name: Food Finder  URL: [foodfinder.io](http://www.foodfinder.io)  My Bio:  I'm a VC, physicist and (weekend) entrepreneur living and working in London. Food Finder was originally a weekend project but has been adopted by a lot of my friends. Now I want to grow the community and improve the platform.   Hey Mikkom,  If you click on one of the restaurant images it'll open up a 'more info' board with a map, streetview, city mapper and uber integration!  Give it a try and let me know what you think,  Joe   Thanks for pointing out Aqua Nueva! The quote is actually referring to one of their other restaurants, Aqua Kyoto, but I agree that it's a little confusing. I'll edit the quote tonight. In the future if you come across something you'd like to edit you can click the 'edit' button in the bottom right hand corner and submit a change :)  Adding a full menu is definitely on my to-do list. I don't suppose you know a nice API that is able to provide restaurant menu's? I think there are a few out there which I'll review once I've made a few other changes.  Thanks a lot for your feedback,  Joe   Thanks for taking the time to write feedback contechual.  In the very long-run I may consider adding some sort of booking system or promoted restaurants as a form of monitisation but for the time being I'm happy on growing the community and hopefully providing a nice product. I'm not a fan of banner ads so I don't think I would ever consider adding them to the site.  I agree with you that the site was looking a bit cluttered. I've made a few changes following other user comments so hopefully the site will look a little cleaner now. Still a way to go but getting there!  You're right that there's quite a bit of empty space on the left-hand side when a foodie opens a restaurant but I'm hoping this adds to the simplicity of the website. I'll have a play around tonight to see if I can make it cleaner with a wider 'more info' board.  Thanks again for your feedback,  Joe  	15
 Haven't watched it, but will try in the near future.                The thing I don't understand is where they got the idea that it wasn't a good pizza, I thought it was good, and would have been better if I had paid attention to the recepies an cut the dough in half. I lost the old recepie I had when I moved about a year ago, so now it's experimenting till I find it or stumble across a new better one. Thanks for the offer I'll keep it in mind in the future.    Who said this wasn't a good pizza? I liked it alot, the only screw up I had is I didn't read the dough recepie right and didn't cut the portion in half. So my pizza is about 1 1/2 inches tall, otherwise  SOOOOOO fucking good.         3 I think it's called Mama 5 yes   What is Yeezy?             It's a old horror film so the legality falls to them                  This is mainly an experiment to begin with, for this size Aerogrow big plants aren't recomended but I want to see how small I can keep the big plants through trimming even if I force it low and over to the side I'll be happy, but if things start not looking good in a few weeks I'll transplant them out and put the bigger palnts in some pots I have as backup. Then I'll just put them out on the balcony and just let them be for the rest of the season. From then on I'll just stick to the recomended plants for the contraption. I've been gardening outdoors since I was a kid but I wanted to see what I could get away with indoors. Later I might try some dwarf varieties to see how they will fare.

 Witte said one problem for the workers is that employers could take advantage of the provision and subtly coerce workers to "volunteer."  You forgot the beginning of the quote.   Why do employers need the ability to make people work seven days a week?  Is it really to their advantage?   Reason magazine seems to do smugness pretty well itself.   Apparently the man has a rich sense of irony.   "I thought it was important to put the focus on the job creators," Walker said.  Jesus, are people still falling for this bunco routine?   Apparently, Cruz thinks this is something to be proud of.      Scott Walker 2016 --  Because you don't want any rights or protections at work   Finally, the scourge of ethics has been eliminated from Wisconsin government.   Edit: Missing word   If that's true, it sure [sucks](http://blackdemographics.com/population/) at it.   It's the real weenies who feel the need to talk tough.   Perhaps because there was a lot of news involving the Confederate flag?   I don't get it either. Dick Cheney is at least as repulsive as Donald Trump.   The more Scott Walker campaigns, the more he proves he is not intellectually fit for the office hes seeking. He asserts innocent ignorance on matters he should by now know something about  a way of masking his apparent bigotry.   I don't care much for Richard Cohen, but he's got Walker figured out pretty well.   Puts him [tied with Dick Cheney](http://www.nytimes.com/2004/05/01/politics/campaign/01CHEN.html).    But Marco Rubio is ready.  But don't take my word for it. Just ask Marco Rubio.   Why not. Fox pretty well runs the Republican Party anyway.   Off is the default position of Trump's filter.  Assuming he has a filter at all.   OK, how about the world's greatest living troll?   It was over 10 years ago. Maybe he thinks hypocrisy has a statue of limitations.   The fact is, were a nation of laws, Walker said.   When will Walker or any other pandering nativist talk about the importance of enforcing the law against employing undocumented workers?      Good, cause I'm enjoying the ride.   I support a free enterprise system unshackled from bad regulation and big labor unions  which were the right thing for American workers in 1890.  And in 2020.  Maybe Jay will come around on that next.   We should let citizens carry guns when they go to meet Presidential candidates.  Why do the second amendment advocates put up with this intolerable restriction?   Judging from how many conservative Christians act, you'd think Jesus told us to berate and denigrate the poor and suck the asses of the wealthy.     Absolutely, when one these 'secure the border' clowns addresses the issue of employers of illegal immigration, I'll start listening to them.   Or we could give equally derisive names to other candidates, like Scottie "Dog" Walker.   No, but I promise you can look forward to convoluted arguments about why this liberal Pope's pronouncements don't matter and the pope should stay out of politics .   The Congressional Research Service found that the vast majority of unauthorized immigrants do not fit in the category that fits Trumps description: aggravated felons, whose crimes include murder, drug trafficking or illegal trafficking of firearms.  I don't disagree with the idea that we'd be better off with less illegal immigration. But it sure seems to me he's exaggerating the criminality of illegal immigrants in some rather heated language. And he's ignoring another group of criminals. The most frequent crime involving illegal aliens is employing them.  Somehow I rarely hear these secure borders advocates talk about cracking down on illegally hiring immigrants. Seems to me fewer employment opportunities for illegal immigrants would do a lot more to reduce their numbers than any wall on the border.   How about [this stuff](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/fact-checker/wp/2015/07/08/donald-trumps-false-comments-connecting-mexican-immigrants-and-crime/)?   So if you want to spew hysterical anti-immigrant racism, looks like you don't need to worry about Scott Walker criticizing you.       I wonder why the author omitted [this statistic](http://www.jsonline.com/business/wisconsin-ranks-35th-in-us-for-job-creation-over-walkers-first-term-b99520739z1-307884841.html).   My salary or Donald's?      The enemy of my enemy is my friend. Go for it, Donald.   Esa es una buena broma, Esteban.    Move over Chicago.  Wisconsin is going to show you how real political corruption works.       Trump isn't running for President, he's putting on the most widely viewed absurdist art performance ever.    Fact checking Donald Trump seems like a pointless undertaking.    And for those trying to play gotcha by pointing out that some of what she said differed from ideas that prevailed when her husband was president, well, many liberals have changed their views in response to new evidence. Its an interesting experience; conservatives should try it some time.  They do learn. Unfortunately, what they've learned is that bashing immigrants and less successful citizens and toadying up to the wealthy is a viable election strategy.       Trump-ism not conservatism but a toxic mix of demagoguery and nonsense.  But a toxic mix of demagoguery and nonsense is working pretty well for Scott Walker!      Doesn't mean we can't enjoy it while it lasts.   Of course , Walker loves Kohl's.  A business that blackmailed Wisconsin into tax subsidies and pay its cashiers less than $9 an hour is the perfect example for his economic vision.   It's hard to believe, but not too long ago Wisconsin had a reputation for squeaky clean government.  Walker and Fitzgerald have got that turned all the way around.   A greasy half-truth from Scott Walker? Get ready for many more, America.   The base eats it up? Check.   The title is the best one sentence description of our current election I've read.   Because unfortunately, laws are always selectively or irregularly enforced. (We could go a long time without an income rate increase if we hired enough IRS agents to truly investigate our richest Americans.) In immigration, there are too many people who have a stake in keeping things as is, so the law enforcement is underfunded and desultory.    The ones against entering the country or the ones against hiring people who entered the country illegally?   The guy who just called Hillary Clinton [Desperate, Sad]( http://dailycaller.com/2015/07/14/donald-trump-responds-to-desperate-sad-hillary-clinton/) is a Democratic plant?  Carlos, would you explain how that fits into your conspiracy theory?    Why are these GOP weenies always so eager to go to war?   Are they furious enough to punish the employers who hire illegal immigrants?  Not likely.   I think Rick Santorum's only priority at the moment is getting someone to pay attention to him.   Something that would help the people who earn the least is 'a really lame idea'.  Looks like you picked the right party Scott.   He's just sort of making up employment numbers, I'd say.      Except Wisconsin didn't have a 3.5 billion dollar deficit.  At least not if you're [using the calculation Walker favors, now that he's governor](http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2015/feb/13/scott-walker/did-scott-walker-flip-flip-budget-shortfall/).    No 6. He lies about as readily as he breathes  http://www.politifact.com/personalities/scott-walker/. http://www.alternet.org/story/150170/20_of_the_biggest_lies_told_by_wisconsin_governor_scott_walker http://wcmcoop.com/2015/02/15/president-walker-primer-4-things-you-should-know-about-scott-walker-before-its-too-late/   So, the Koch Brothers are putting $900 million into the election and Jeb Bush has raised $114 million, but somehow jobs supporting Republican candidates pay $1000 a month.  But they're going to make things better for America's workers.     Start with Scott Walker. Please.   OK, then I'm sorry for the citizens in Maine who didn't vote for this clown and need to live through his administration.  Us Wisconsin progressives understand all too well.   If that's true, then [this guy](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/10/us/billionaire-lifts-marco-rubio-politically-and-personally.html) is going to want his money back.   Fun while it lasts ... but remember Herman Cain was leading the polls for a while last time.   I feel sorry for the citizens of Maine ... but I hope they can take some solace in the entertainment their governor provides the rest of us.   It's taken awhile, but they're starting to [wise up](https://law.marquette.edu/poll/).     I hope Walker runs on his 'accomplishments' in Wisconsin.  Scott Walker - Ending Wisconsin's tradition of fine public education !!   Where he will be joined by [zero](http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2015/07/07/republicans-2016-hopefuls-to-skip-la-raza-gathering-of-latino-activists/) Republican presidential candidates.    Once all the good teachers are gone, we'll hear about how Kansas schools are failing and they need to privatized.    I guess we'll have to agree to disagree about how badly our elections have been compromised by money.   He scares me a little, and I can't help but to notice that the more his opposition hates on him, the more support he gets, due to this deeply seated democratic hatred for his haters, and what they stand for  [Maybe not](https://law.marquette.edu/poll/2015/04/16/marquette-law-school-poll-finds-walker-job-approval-down/). Although he may coast into the White House under of a barrage of right wing money.  God help us all then.   There are two issues with Walker's election victories. First, there's the [two electorate issue](http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2015-07-09/why-rubio-jeb-walker-and-kasich-are-not-as-purple-as-they-look).  Conservatives do better in off year elections.  Second, money obviously plays a big role in elections (why else would politicians spend so much time chasing it), and Walker has received millions of dollars of out of state support.  He was elected as much by ALEC et, al as the voters of Wisconsin.   That's less than $2 for [every US casualty](http://costsofwar.org/article/us-and-allied-wounded) in Iraq and Afghanistan. A bargain!   The 11th-hour additions include a repeal of wage protections for construction workers on local government projects, the elimination of workers right to one day off per week, ... Another change made over the Fourth of July weekend eliminates the states long-standing living wage law and replaces all references to a living wage with minimum wage.  Scott Walker for President! Bringing you fewer rights or protections on the job!   What I can't understand is why anybody would want to subject an audience to speech by George W. Bush, let alone give him a $100,000 for it.   On the upside, as long as Brownback is preoccupied with this nonsense, he's not  fucking up Kansas's economy even further.   That will work out to about 2.50 per citizen in Oregon. I'll bet they can handle it.   We'll see more of this and eventually it will become the norm.  The US requires a more educated workforce and high school isn't enough. With unions being eviscerated, we're losing the apprentice program, so community colleges will need to provide the skill training.   He is the only bluesman to have his music [launched into deep space](http://www.vox.com/2015/7/7/8906867/scott-walker-immigration).    I wonder if he'll feel the need to [retract](http://www.vox.com/2015/7/7/8906867/scott-walker-immigration) that statement soon.    And that invalidates all the other evidence and arguments for the existence of climate change?  How?    I don't care to defend anyone's bad behavior. But how does this incident refute all the evidence that climate change is occurring?    Are you talking about [this incident](http://www.factcheck.org/2009/12/climategate/)?    Or perhaps it's only common knowledge inside your echo chamber.   Source?   And Walker, Rubio, Bush, etc.  They're not conservatives, they're merely dogsbodies for the wealthy.    I'm looking forward to AEI's article on how outrageous executive compensation affects prices.   Might work. I'd like to ask them if they want to dispute the current scientific consensus in astronomy or germ theory.    Not to forget [this conversation](http://host.madison.com/news/local/writers/steven_elbow/british-prime-minister-david-cameron-i-never-told-scott-walker/article_65cb00ae-94fc-5850-b6d3-aa6fa374bf71.html) with Scott Walker either.  Odd how this keeps happening to Walker, isn't it?   The GOP's usual M.O..   On Sunday, after three days of pressure from Mr. Walkers aides, Mr. Moore said that he had misspoken when recounting his call with Mr. Walker  and that the call had never actually taken place.  He had misspoken and the call never took place anyway?  Of course it's not like Stephen Moore had any integrity to lose.    A review of documents of the ruling obtained by International Business Times showed that the study saying the $7.25 minimum wage was adequate in meeting living wage standards was largely **based on findings provided by the restaurant industry in the state**.  Scott Walker for President -  Prosperity through Lower Wages       Source?   Right, so let's elect someone named Clinton.  Seems the economy works better than we elect someone named Bush.   Hey Alex and Matthew, while your at it, why don't you tell your old man his economics are bullshit?  Or call him out on his corruption or lies?     I'd prefer to think of him as a bought and paid for toady.   Walker is running as corrupt a political machine as you'll find in America.   Edit: Couple of links for sourcing.  [The Progressive](http://www.progressive.org/news/2014/10/187897/scott-walker%E2%80%99s-corruption-problem) and  [Alternet](http://www.alternet.org/tea-party-and-right/scott-walkers-political-record-lies-deceit-corruption-and-revenge)   No where in the article is there a quote from the CBO saying the economy is in a death spiral.  However there is a quote from the House Budget Committee chairman saying our national debt is spiraling out of control.  That kind of reporting would get you a C- in your Intro to Journalism class.  Oh, and no link to the report, just links to other Washington Times articles.  Guess they don't want to make it easy for anyone to fact check.   Cruz already has gathered support from other ultra-rich backers, including the billionaire hedge fund manager Robert Mercer. Mercer and two others seeded a pack of spending groups called Keep the Promise, allowing Cruz to reveal a $31 million haul in a single week.  Man of the people, that Ted Cruz.    Because Minnesota and Wisconsin are relatively similar states that  had elections in 2010 and followed very different paths, with very different results.  It's about as close to a controlled experiment as you can have in American economics.   Only when you compare it to a Republican run Wisconsin   Which side has a track record of trying to do something (not very much, but something) for the middle class?  Which side would you trust do address income and wealth inequality? Which side realizes that humans are contributing to climate change? If you say the Republicans, (or these issues aren't important to you) go ahead and vote for them.  Assuming we don't get Sanders, I'll take my chances with Clinton.   Everybody gets a turn leading the Republican primary polls. Herman Cain was leading some polls at one point last time.   I always remember this John Kenneth Galbraith quote when making political decisions.   Politics is the art of choosing between the disastrous and the unpalatable.  Am I thrilled by the backers of and all the choices made by the  Clintons and Obama? Of course not. Would I take take them again over another Bush or Scott Walker, etc?  Absolutely.    Everything really. Wisconsin used to be known for clean government and great public education.  Scott Walker has turned that around.   I don't want to trade. Do you?   More than a third of the firms $33 million in proceeds from 2007 to 2013 came from banking giants Lehman Bros. and Barclays, which paid Bush a combined total of about $12 million for his work as a senior adviser.  Who's interests do you think he's going to look after if he's elected President?  Yours?   I have two issuesv with your argument.  'Many Republicans like Rand Paul' doesn't consist of very many Republicans.  Only a [dismaying small percentage](http://www.businessinsider.com/10-percent-of-republicans-think-climate-change-is-human-caused-2015-7) of Republicans believe that climate change is caused by humans. Secondly, 'strong capitalism' isn't going to fix climate change by itself.  If you want a market based solution to climate change, you need to provide some incentives, some way to profit from addressing the problem.  There was support for that among republicans in the past (solutions like cap and trade), but it's virtually non-existent now.   In 1998, Walker championed the Truth In Sentencing Act, a bill that would go on to become law, star in that constituent newsletter and create an approach to imprisonment critics said would later balloon the states prison population and lead to severe racial disparities in the prison population.  .... A 2004 Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel investigation found the law would cost Wisconsin $1.8 billion dollars over 25 years and bring prison spending to par with the states university system.  See what Scott Walker has done for Wisconsin - think what he can do for America.      If I were comparing them I would have written a statement like 'Although Obama drew 30,000 for a speech at the height of the election, Sanders was able to draw a crowd 1/3 that size for a speech 16 months before the election.'  I was pointing out that Madison speeches draw huge crowds. If Clinton comes here, I wouldn't be surprised if she has a larger crowd than the 5500 she drew in New York   I thought your 'two ways to look at it' hardly covered all the scenarios of people working many hours.  Notice I amended it with an 'Or' statement.    Or they have meaningless low pay jobs and need to work 2 or 3 jobs to survive.  Or they have "supervisory" or non-exempt jobs and are forced to work extra hours because their employer would rather squeeze them than hire extra employees. You have a rather optimistic view of how employment works for Americans on the lower end of the pay scale.   Hey Scott, since you're suddenly concerned about environmental issues, you might want to take a second look at climate change.   This early polls are as much about name recognition as support.    Sure is, I almost bought one myself. We seem to go through car trends in my neighborhood.  First we all had Saturns, then suddenly there were Priuses everywhere, and now it's the Fit.    They're not meant to be comparable, just to demonstrate that if you're a Democrat Presidential candidate, Madison is good place to get a large crowd for a speech.    	120
 Tomato, tomato.         That's how I saw it too.   It looked like a blue heeler (cattle dog) in the original video.   There may be a Scully in there somewhere.         A very small, compact Diahatsu-Weyland-Yutani hatchback APC.       I've been doing something similar. I think the Glass Skull is so effective, except you will get a lot of moisture build up.

Reddit can never have too many safe's.    It's safe to safe that he achieved that!    I guess he didn't want to be the butt of any dick jokes.      Didn't stop me from looking up though.      Technically, this joke isn't funny.   We don't say which comedians we do like. We'll say which comedians we don't like. When asked, of course.   Now you...do?      Honestly, similar to my [Glass Skull](http://i.imgur.com/nrWSQvi.jpg) project, I hadn't put much thought into the plants themselves. These are my first two terrariums and I'm just seeing how the containers handle themselves (how much water to use, what soil/rock combination to use). I'm almost ashamed to say that these are carnation seeds, but I'll probably change it to something more suitable  once these guys run their course. Its a simple set up with larger stones blocking the gumball shoot, bonsai pebbles at the base and plain potting mix for the seeds. It's all trial and error.   The top screws off, and any excess water drips down into the gumball catcher. I suspect the plants will outgrow the container, but I'm okay with that.   I had the exact same thought, the human eyes on an animals face.      Taken on the camera of my LG G2. I only managed to get a couple of shots because those boats were flying.   The boats all ended up in the drain at the end of the street. We couldn't  keep up with them to see Pennywise though.       Almost, it was taken from the Katherine Times,  by the NT News.   Dang it. I was hoping alcohol was involved.   I dare say alcohol was involved. So, how'd you burn your arm?      Yes. Yes it is.   It looks like it's climbed it's way out of something else.

My next attempt will be with venus flytraps, because they seem to require a lot of moisture.    No, it's just a $10 knock off. It is the same size though.   Thanks. I normally leave it open each night, maybe I should leave it off during the day as well.  	64
 [Here](https://goo.gl/maps/apAKw) is a link to the location I took the picture on google maps. It's right at the apex of the big u-turn. There's a pull-off on the side of the road where you can get out and look at the canyon.   If you have time, you should definitely check out Gateway while you're there. There's an awesome place to stay there called [Gateway Canyons Resort](http://www.gatewaycanyons.com) that has TONS of cool stuff. My personal favorite is the auto museum, which isn't that expensive, and you get to go see some really unique cars. The whole place is owned by the guy who owns the Discovery channel, and he's put a lot of work into it and it shows. Anyways, take care and let me know if you have any more questions!   It's called the Hanging Flume and was built by gold miners in 1887. The overall length was 12 miles. It took three years to complete and was only used for three years afterwards. [Here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanging_Flume) is a link to the wikipedia page about it. It's a pretty interesting read, and there's a lot more information available if you go looking for it.   Near Gateway, Colorado.      He said, "Should we try the Paradox Grille?"  "No," I replied. "I would rather eat at the Two Doctors Grille."  Paid him back after all of these years!!!   I just love [original content](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/For_sale:_baby_shoes,_never_worn).   Well, honestly it wasn't random. It was in response to your racist language. In the video, President Obama talks about how racism is a real issue that we still battle every day. Anyways, take care and I hope you think about what you write before you post.

Individuals such as former technical director of NSA and one of the best NSA crypto-mathematicians William Binney (who helped design mass surveillance systems for the agency), Thomas Drake, Coleen Rowley, Annie Machon, Elizabeth Murray, David MacMichael, Jesselyn Radack, Todd Pierce, could always bring to light some new interesting facts, perspectives, personal thoughts about privacy, intelligence, surveillance, law enforcement, following and breaking the oath to the American Constitution.

 aah. common man! ok what is your taste will try to write one on your taste.   Can you tell me why so that I can improve it next time ?      Shaun the sheep is already in theaters with 7.4 IMDB ratings. If you want me to write about this movie I can write for you.   Lol, next time I will ask you guys about the movies you like the most. :) I am thinking of adding post on the blogs which viewer suggest me. If you have any topic on which you want me to write you can give it to me.                              One of the best thing i saw today. thank you guys.      lol, I will upload them as soon I get it :P                       	24
 So I find with most of the books that I read, i read the text but i don;t really retain a lot of the information. This isn't usually too big a problem because most books don;t have too many different plots/characters/etc. However I'm currently reading the Silmarillion, and dear God is there a lot of information. Does anyone have any tricks on how to retain the information that you read better?   I'm trying to jailbreak my iphone 5s running on 8.4 but the TaiG installer is telling me "Apple driver hasn't been found. Please download and install iTunes". I don't really feel like re-installing itunes and having to go through ratings and playlists again. Does anyone know of a fix for this?      This is actually a very good analogy, I think this one would be a bit more controversial because we talk about pizza a lot more than planets (says something about society doesn't it). Change is good but change is hard I guess.    In my mind its simple, it is a dwarf planet, based upon new information that wasn't available when it was first discovered. Things change, we have to adapt. If you still consider Pluto a planet, why? (besides the fact that you like it, or want it to be a planet, that holds no scientific meaning)      When are you no longer a beginner? I've been lifting for a while now, saw good progression at first but it hasn't been as fast recently.   So I'm just starting to follow the beginner PPL Routine (https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/37ylk5/a_linear_progression_based_ppl_program_for/) and it says to add weight linearly       2.5kg/5lbs for upper body lifts (bench press, row, overhead press)     2.5kg/5lbs for squats     5kg/10lbs for deadlifts  I'm assuming this means add this to only the first lift of the day and with thew accessory lifts increase the weight when i can do the max number of reps per set in the specified range. 5 Pounds per week seems like a lot for bench though, I've only managed to up it by about 10 pounds in the past 2 months (not following this routine albeit). Is that really feasible while eating at a 700ish cal deficit since I'm on a cut?    Would you be able to do another quick colour edit? Getting this as a tattoo soon and trying to decide on what mix of colour and black.   I work 9-3 Saturdays and I think I'll bring along a gym bag and if i have energy hit the gym for legs after work. Thanks for all your help, hopefully the next two months can show as much progress as the last two. I think between changing up my routine and adding some HIIT i can really get some good results before i start my first bulk in the October (that's the plan at least).   I really like the look of the beginner PPL (https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/37ylk5/a_linear_progression_based_ppl_program_for/) . I'm wondering if I could do a PPLPP and still see good results? I'm really set on working out on every weekday because it fits really nicely into my schedule and I like my weekends to relax. I have a pretty good base for legs already from running and cross country skiing.  	11
 Basically the trades that would make people say, "Yea, that makes total sense."  Edit:  Mention the teams involved.  Not just the players/coaches/assets/etc.         If you don't know who your starter is (or the team you're trading with)... explain which QB(s) will be the starter(s).  Edit...If you're feeling frisky... go ahead and reallocate the starting four QBs in your division... everyone playing for a different team.   ...181818181818181818181818181818181818181818181818181818181818181818181818181818181818181818181818181818181818181818181818181818181818181818181818181818181818181818181818181818181818181818181818181818181818181818181818181818181818181818181818181818181818181818181818181818181818181818181818181818181818181818181818181818181818181818181818181818181818181818181818181818181818181818181818181818181818181818181818181818181818181818181818181818181818181818181818181818181818181818181818181818181818181818181818181818181818181818181818181818181818181818181818181818181818181818181818181818181818181818181818181818181818181818181818181818181818181818181818181818181818181818181818181818181818181818181818181818181818181818181818181818181818181818181818181818181818181818181818181818181818181818181818181818181818181818181818181818181818181818181818181818181818181818181818181818181818181818181818181818181818181818181818181818181818181818181818181818181818181818181818181818181818181818181818181818181818181818181818181818181818181818181818181818181818181818181818181818181818181818181818181818181818181818181818181818181818181818181818181818181818181818181818181818181818181818181818181818181818181818181818...   http://i.imgur.com/DKKdElX.jpg  :)   Yes, you are allowed to paste in pictures, but the real winners just use brushes and love of the artform.   Yes, you are allowed to paste in pictures, but the real winners just use brushes and love of the artform.   The outfits aren't revealing enough.  I need this to be Ghostbustier.  I hope Anna Kendrick plays Slimer.   Not the city, the name of the team like Lions, Raiders, etc.   Besides the fact that half of his game pieces have been dunked in milk.... oh the smell...  Edit:  And yes, Indiana John is good.  I want to play Trajan with him, 'cause I've never played it.  :(   Already have a film treatment entitled:  Charlie and the Chewy, Chunky, Chocolate Chase.  In the film, Charlie stumbles upon forbidden recipes that Willy Wonka left behind (and hid rather well), and worldwide catastrophes ensure thereafter (which a supposedly dead Willy Wonka seems to not be as dead as he's supposed to be).  Matthew Lewis (Neville from Harry Potter films) plays Charlie and multiple actors play "Willy Wonka", but the main one is Domhnall Gleeson.  The way Willy Wonka is portrayed/played/hinted at/etc is more complicated than that.    Lots of in camera tricks and practical effects like Coppola's Dracula.  Very, very limited use of CG for a few things that would be impossible with traditional special effects, but would go unnoticed as a non-effect.  The story is not so much about Charlie's hubris (as he never really had high levels of that).  It's more about Charlie trying to recapture his childhood.  Trying not to let go of it.  Edit:  Yes, there are songs.  Yes, Oompa Loompas dance and sing.  No, I'm not incorporating much of the Roald Dahl's sequel "Charlie and the Great Glass Elevator" in the film as I prefer the gritty, ominous, innocently hopeful, humorously terrifying reality of the 1971 film.  It's more a spiritual sequel to that film while interweaving more of Dahl's joyous (though morbid) sensibilities.  Spoilers - [Early drafts of the book pointed to child murder, cannibalism, and other atrocities.  I like how the film hints at horrible fates, though obviously Wonka says in the end that they'll be "restored to their normal, terrible old selves."  In my film, people outside the factory are as strange as they were in the first film, obsessed with chocolate, randomly singing, etc.  The big secret of my film treatment is the mysterious Willy Wonka that seems to be sneaking around really is Charlie (played by Domhnall Gleeson).  Matthew Lewis is just one of Charlie's poor childhood friends.  Charlie didn't feel right that just his family got to live happily ever after, so he brought lots of poor families in with him and they all run the plant and the Oompa Loompas that wanted to leave could go. Matthew Lewis is just a diversion like Slugworth.  They create this crazy story involving secret recipes, international espionage, competing companies, mysterious Wonka sightings, and missing children to preserve the imagination of their childhoods.  I might add more on here if I get bored but so little to write and so much time...](/spoiler)   Clever and serious answers are welcomed.  Edit:  Also, if you need help, resources and information are available at [r/SuicideWatch](http://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/).   Wonderful, flawed, vibrant, unique film.  William Forsythe = perfect casting.  Worth watching for the art direction alone.  Would love to see more comic book movies embrace more aspects of their source material besides characters and story lines.     Was perusing [Wikipedia's NBA Champions list](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_NBA_champions#NBA_champions) while energetically bored, so here's some interesting info which I assume is mostly correct... will edit if I discover errors.   * Since the inception of the NBA Championship in 1950, [42](http://i.imgur.com/4MbRqnD.jpg) Finals teams held the season's best record in terms of wins/losses. (43 if you count this year's Golden State Warriors)   * 31 of those teams won the championship.   * 7 of those teams lost the championship.   * 4 of those teams were in Finals where both teams had the same (top regular season) record.  In 1955, the Syracuse Nationals beat the Fort Wayne Pistons... and in 1998, the Chicago Bulls beat the Utah Jazz. (and yes, I didn't include them in the percentage.. it's like 78.5% if you include them, but I was more curious about when a best-record team faces a non-best-record team)   * In 1975, the East's 2nd seed Washington Bullets lost to the West's 1st seed Golden State Warriors.  Interestingly enough, the Bullets had a better record than the Warriors and tied the Boston Celtics (East's 1st seed) for the best regular season record that year.   * The last time a Finals team with the lone best record lost the championship was in 1993 when Phoenix Suns lost to the Chicago Bulls.   * [Lebron](http://i.imgur.com/HEfegqC.jpg) has only played on one Finals team that held the best regular season record (2013)...  his second ring.   * Four of [Jordan](http://i.imgur.com/mlEPhJZ.jpg)'s Finals teams held the best record (with the obvious 1998 Jazz tie caveat).  His other two Finals teams were his first trip to the championship and the third where he beat the season's best team (by record), [Charles Barkley](http://i.imgur.com/LDGbj7E.jpg)'s Phoenix Suns.   * Since 2000, only 6 Finals teams held the best regular season record (including this year's Warriors), and yes, the five others won the championship.  Though interestingly enough, if the Warriors win the Finals this year, it will be 3 best-record champs in a row.  If I think of more, I'll add them below.  Peruse the [Wiki page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_NBA_champions#NBA_champions) and other sources of NBA info and let's see what else we can come up with!  Edit: Yay for bullet points!   Rodgers, Brady, P. Manning, E. Manning, and Brees will never win another Super Bowl.   Roethlisberger will win two more.   Tannehill will win three total over a long career.   Bridgewater gets one SB win in the next 5 years then another win in the twilight of his career.     Luck gets one win total like Peyton.   Romo never plays in a Super Bowl.   Flacco, Ryan, and Rivers fade quickly over the coming years.   Wilson plays in another SB as a backup on another team.  Loses.   Jacksonville plays in two Super Bowls in the next ten years.   Matthew Stafford throws a TD to Tim Tebow at least once during his career.   Two players will die during NFL games over the next ten years.  One on the field in a tragic awkward-tackling accident.  The other is assassinated.   A similar NBA post of mine elicited interesting comments, so I wanted to get your guys' unpopular opinions as well.  Looking for those views, thoughts, assumptions, predictions, assessments, etc that may rile up others but you definitely believe.  Be sure not to downvote because you disagree.  Instead of downvoting, make a comment!         Warriors win it all 4-1. Curry is MVP. LeBron gives a decent but underwhelming performance. Blatt is blamed for strange substitutions at the end of games.  Love leaves for LA. LeBron instagrams something misconstrued as racist against Love, then tweets something that makes it worse, and then loses sponsorships. LeBron has a tearful press conference where he talks about race, basketball, fame, and family. People forgive him, and many see the incident as media-created (and don't believe LeBron is actually racist). The Cavs barely make the playoffs next year, as the East is suprisingly stronger. Bucks win next year's Finals over the Thunder 4-3 in what is considered the best NBA Finals ever. KD goes to the Wizards and Westbrook goes to LA. LA never does much in the playoffs and the Wizards eventually win two championships. Westbrook eventually wins a title as a bench player with the Celtics before retiring.      I've listened to their show from time to time, and am waiting for my laundry to dry, so here's my "one big thing" collection of random thoughts.  SVP always seemed like the princess and the pea.  Too fussy and full of himself.  Rusillo usually has more interesting takes, but seems to suffer from a pseudo-arrogant "I went to the wrong fraternity and didn't get with enough girls back then and am getting older and all my friends are married to hotties and I'm not sure if people tune in to listen to just SVP and just tolerate me" mentality.  But, besides all of that, they are the best ESPN radio show by a sizable degree.  SVP's late night show may work.  Matters how curmudgeony he is.  If he just has fun with it and carves a new niche where he's not a fuss-pot, then it may have legs.  He doesn't have even half of Letterman's charisma, wit, intelligence, and knowledge base, so I think just being the "tall cynical guy who knows Tiger Woods" won't be enough.  Rusillo on the other hand, who knows.  I assume he doesn't want to just chill in that time slot with that Virk guy or whomever.  Virk still needs to apologize for littering throughout the U.S.  He talked about it on the show for awhile and seemed to imply zero regret while laughing about it.  He's low-end talent that needs to bake awhile longer in the basement of ESPN News for awhile until he actually can play with the big boys and girls.  Speaking of girls, I would love to see more female hosts and anchors.  Jackie MacMullan is one of my favorite ESPN personalities, though she's not on Around the Horn enough.  She guest hosted His and Hers recently.  I wish she was a daily, permanent presence on ESPN.  Back to Rusillo.  He may bolt and join Bill Simmons, doing whatever he's doing next, but I think money may keep him with ESPN as an NBA analyst/radio host/etc.    Also that guy who doesn't believe in dinosaurs seems like a bully.  Oooo.  My laundry is dry.  Go Pacers/Pistons!     Of the non-wrestling photos... http://i.imgur.com/Lt5XarD.jpg   Obviously doesn't have to be a gameplay photo.  	23
 Hello, /r/books; I'm a big fan of the Southern Gothic genre. If you're also a fan, I would love to know what you think are the best entries and authors in the genre.  Are you an old school Faulkner fan? A literary allegeoran McCarthy fan? Are you keeping it lighter with Ron Rash? Rolling wordy and atmospheric with Daniel Woodrell? Tell me all about it! :)   Movie night KILLED ME.  Seriously.  I blubber just REMEMBERING it... These filmmakers, I tell yah!    Well, with the seven or so upvotes and five or so downvotes, it seems to be controversial enough!  Thanks for the props, I kind of knew going in it wasn't going to be a piece of cake, redditors seem to really like McCarthy's work.    The truth is that I'm frustrated.  I set out to read all of his novels based upon the hype that he's the greatest living author today and a writer's writer.  I absolutely hate that there is something wrong with me that stops me from having any of the four novels I've finished resonate with me.  I'm beginning to come to the conclusion that I don't have the ability to postulate emotions without pointers from the author.  I'm also sad because a lot of the premises sound so wonderful, and seem to me to have such potential for wide emotional range and exploration of human nature, but I can't find that in the way he is writing.  Now again, I acknowledge that this is my short coming.  Still, I feel discouraged and like I'm missing out on something really great.  Hopefully the more aggressive folks in this thread don't see this and rip me a new one ;)            Do you have any board games to recommend for 2 players?  I'm looking for something specifically designed for 2, not a span of players where it is inevitably better with three or four folks.  Thank you! :)   Well, this is a privately owned website, meaning that you are not entitled to "freedom of speech" here.  I guess I'm confused about why you would expect it to be a pantheon of free expression, so there's your question: Why do you think you should be able to say or create whatever you want on a privately owned platform?    I recommend you move on over to 8ch.net, seems more your speed.     I recommend a re-read of something familiar and warm, like the Phantom Tollbooth.  I needed a palette cleanser as it actually could've spiraled off into a depression.  I mean, it's great that a work of literature can make you feel so much, but you have to live your life afterwards and if you can't stop thinking about how your mom and your sister have organs, it makes it a bit difficult.    I would recommend the film, absolutely.  Maybe watch that then move on.     I agree, this one left me utterly devastated for about a week afterwards.  The film was a very good adaptation, but it added these additional little knife twists, I cried pretty much start to finish since I'd already read the book before I saw it.  This book is definitely a catalyst for an existential crisis.  I've re-read it only once more.  It's just too sad.     You're absolutely right, thank you for pointing that out.    Here is the source you requested regarding writing about life and death: http://www.nytimes.com/books/98/05/17/specials/mccarthy-venom.html  Here is the source you requested on infant mortality rates in 1850: http://hdl.handle.net/2027/uc2.ark:/13960/t4qj7qt8w Now this alone, of course, doesn't stand by itself.  We need to consider the number of people in the settlement, the fact that we're only babies for about two years of our lives in coordination with the mortality rate.   Your rebuttal merely boils down to the second sentence you wrote.    I have a few corrections.    I did not have a visceral reaction to the baby killing, my disgust is that he thinks his audience is so easy to manipulate.    The robin gets away from the baby, and the argument isn't that the baby did a horrible thing, it's that the baby did something that isn't even possible for a baby to do.  The creative license taken with a baby's coordination for the purpose of a morbid action.  Why?  In response to your section about the Road: Does it make any sense to have a farm of "animals" that have a gestation period of 9 months?  Absolutely not.  A baby will feed you for how many days, sir?  I'm sorry, you've failed to convince me that this makes any sense.   Telling me I don't have to read things and that I'm wrong isn't a rebuttal...and these were presented as my opinions.  Please check out /u/Deus_Fax_Machina as an example of what I'm looking for.       I found this to be a very compelling read; thank you for your thoughtful contribution.  That the point was not realism certainly puts things in a different light and makes a lot of sense in the context that the book is an homage to Moby Dick.     I have upvoted you for telling me something I was unaware of.  That I know of now, we have baby killing in 4 out of 10 (admittedly, I haven't read them ALL, so there could very well be more) novels.  I've seen the death of an infant done well, but I've never seen it become a career-wide trend.  It seems totally inappropriate to me that this is something he comes back to again and again.       Has anyone actually asked Cormac McCarthy why he hates babies so much?    Is ANY of this baby killing necessary?  Does it ever add?  Or is it just a cheap parlor trick he thinks hes entitled to in the same way hes entitled to write pages upon pages of Spanish with no translation?  Or in the same way he has the right to look down his nose at authors who deal with issues of life and death (Id NEVER describe his work as that I mean, no one EVER DIES in his books, right?)  I dont get it.  And beyond the baby killing, whats with the absolute venom he uses when describing said babies?  I mean, one could argue thats Lester talking when he describes the baby as a drooling little monster, but lets be real here, he underlines that this is what he really thinks by giving this baby supernatural coordination so he can capture a robin and rip its legs off with his mouth  You ever tried to catch a bird with your hands before?  Its almost impossible no baby that is still drooling on itself is capable of that kind of magic.     Which brings up my next point Why is this guy lauded as the greatest of our time when he writes all these totally implausible scenarios?  A TREE of dead babieshow many babies were surviving in a small settlement during that time period?  Surely not enough to decorate a tree with!  Heres another: in a post-apocalyptic society, there would be not medical services.  Maternal and infant death rates would skyrocket.  If a baby DID manage to make it out unscathed, we wouldnt barbeque it!  Its too precious!  A mothers body is built to feed that baby during famine regardless of how hungry she is... If the mother is dead, a woman can actually start lactation by repeated attempts to feed the child There is NO REASON to believe we would be eating babies.  Dogs and even adults make more sense.  It seems (brace yourself) SLOPPY.  Just like the lack of proper punctuation seems LAZY (Please dont jump in with that oral tradition argument, the man himself says [Theres no reason to clutter up the page with a bunch of stupid dots] He doesnt even try to defend himself reasonably like his fans do).  And just like pages and pages of Spanish in the middle of an English language novel is SELF INDULGENT.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, I get it.  This is what the protagonist would hear as he would hear it, but the point of fiction isnt to be a faithful record it never actually happened, so there is no way for it to be a faithful record the point of fiction is to be read, and if we cant comprehend what were reading, then the point is missed.  The story is lost.     Am I crazy here?  Can someone write a good rebuttal as to why we need a dead baby to make a good Cormac McCarthy novel?   If you like southern gothic, the Charles Frazier novel Nightwoods contains this element you speak of.  In fact, it moves back and forth like that a few times.  I was initially disappointed with this novel having picked it up shortly after reading Daniel Woodrell's Winter's Bone; but since re-reading it twice, I've come to really love it.     Well, the other important thing that your savvy responder didn't mention is that tax situations vary widely person to person.  We get to choose how many allowances to take or not take, whether to withhold as single, married, or married but at a single rate... some of us are even tax exempt.  Your salary in your area is a status marker, for while I may choose to funnel funds every which-way, if I say I make $50,000, you know I'm a semi big deal (if I'm young) or I've been working for many, many years at a not-so impressive job (if I'm older).  If I say I'm making $100,000 you can deduce things about me, and if I say I'm making $16,000 you can deduce things about me.  Now, my salary is about $45,000 per year pre-tax.  But I have daycare costs, health insurance, and 12% for retirement drawn out automatically.  If I told you the truth, which is that my take-home is $550 a paycheck, you would draw very different conclusions about how far I am in building my career at age 28.     I think it depends on what your frame of reference is... you see, one US Edition (woe be to me, the one I picked up) compared Stieg Larsson to Thomas Harris.  Thomas Harris might have some failings when it comes to storylines, but he researched things meticulously and he never held back in showing us all of the things he had learned.  I went in with a certain expectation.    It was not, in any way, satisfied.  I'd give it 1/4 stars.     I see both of the offerings for advice here is to apply the pressure to your current employer.  I hate to rain on their parades, but this almost never works.  We start working at places to build our resumes so we can move on to places that will pay us what we're actually worth.  This is exactly what your co-worker did.  In my former job, I started at the ground level.  I was promoted four times.  At the end I was traveling and giving in-person presentations to the second in command at the biggest utility company in the United States.  The irony was that my salary was less than what their entry level employees were making (a lot less, $15 an hour less).  In fact, my salary was the lowest on the team, despite the fact that I was, above and beyond, the very best person on that team.  I outstripped every single one of them on tenure within the company, I had more duties, I had more quantifiable results, and recommendations from every client I worked with.  I was actually a bargaining chip at one point.  I was running the training department and my former client threatened to pull their 11 million dollar contract with us if I did not come back and manage their account... the kid who was running it at the time?  Making more money than me.     Finally, I got sick of working 56 hour weeks on my too-low salary.  I found another job.  A job that gave me a 12% raise from what I was making then right out of the gate.  They even hired me while I was six months pregnant.  If you know you deserve better, go out and get it.  You can go to your current employer with your offer letter and you give them the chance to match it if you want, but I think you'll find it feels a lot better to work with people who appreciate you.       Ready for battle!   That was literally my reaction upon reading Peter Straub's the Buffalo Hunters from his collection "A Room without Doors," which would fit in pretty nicely for this thread. The guy makes himself wallpaper out of baby bottle nipples and then rolls around against it. He also makes himself a nice nipple bedspread. It was like who agreed to publish this? Other highlights from the collection include a child learning hypnotism and using it to torture his toddler aged little brother with a hat pin and another story about skipping school to go to the movies and becoming the daily target of a pedophile.    I haven't, but honest to goodness, I will now. :)    I thought Clay's cameo in Rules of Attraction was a bit far-fetched for this reason. It just seemed really sweet to me, and that's not who he was.    Same. It was far fetched and weird, not disturbing, in my opinion. Completely unbelievable.    I'm a huge fan too! I liked Out better, I thought it was a bit tighter. I enjoyed Real World too. I hope her other books get translations soon. You should check out the Sex issue of Granta...there is a very funny short story about this woman who is the sole lady in a large group of men on a desert island. It doesn't go at all how you think it will.    Annnnnd subscribed! Thanks!    We have everything in common.  [When I read this review](http://www.cinemablend.com/reviews/The-Runaways-4530.html), I was like, this guy knows my heart.  That's just how I felt watching her.  I mean, she was such a perfect choice for that role.  Mono-syllabic but still completely mesmerizing and magnetic.    If you're the maid of honor, I don't believe you're required to give a gift by etiquette... you're going to have to plan and fund (or figure out funding) for the bachelorette party and the bridal shower.  You're also traditionally tasked with corralling the bridesmaids to stuff like dress fittings and making sure they pay for things on time, not to mention, anything else the bride asks you to do...   If they're not going traditional like above and you're just showing up with a gift, you should go with something sentimental and handmade.  Or get them a better version of something they already have.  I love my [Victorinox Huntsman jackknife](http://www.amazon.com/Victorinox-Swiss-Huntsman-Pocket-Knife/dp/B0001P151W/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8 qid=1436823057 sr=8-1 keywords=victorinox+huntsman).  You could get them both one (they come in about 20 different colors) and stay in your price range.   I envy you. ;)    I'm a college drop out myself.  I also make $20k more a year than the average American woman.  I own a house, I'm married, and I have an eight month old baby.  I can afford to pay my mother for daycare, so she doesn't actually have a job outside the home.  Basically, I'm a bad ass and I regret nothing.  If you can take control of your situation and figure out what YOU want and how to get there, no one is going to look down their nose at you for not finishing school.  Success is subjective.  Your family, ultimately wants you to be happy and healthy.  There may be a bit of disappointment initially, but you need to do what you need to do to make yourself happy.  No one else is going to advocate for you.      Someone had bemoaned the same books coming up over and over, so being that I have an intense interest in morbid literature, here are some books you don't hear about (nearly as much):  **Zombie** - Joyce Carol Oates (She's writing a journal as Jeffrey Dahmer)  **Daddy Love** - Joyce Carol Oates (It's about a little boy who is kidnapped by a rapist and held captive for years)  **We Need to Talk about Kevin** - Lionel Shriver (Mother writes to husband about what went wrong in parenting an eventual school shooting organizer)  **Out** - Natsuo Kirino (OH SNAP, you need to read this one if you like disturbing lit... Group of women from factory help a woman dispose of the body of her abusive husband, crazy shit ensues)  **The Collector** - John Fowles (this one will kill you if you're a serious redditor... you see the main character's mentality displayed here often (man wins lottery, kidnaps dream girl))  **Little Star** - John Ajvide Lindqvist (Although all of his books are worth your time (Old man goes mushrooming, finds a baby half buried in the woods, instead of crying she sings out a perfect note... he decides it's his fate to raise her in his basement as a sort of musical experiment, violence ensues))  **White as Snow** - Tanith Lee (Snow White re-write)  Skip anything by Jack Ketchum.  He's about as subtle as a chainsaw, you'll just come away numb.    That is legitimately the only way to describe the plot of "Lullaby..." I mean, what a fucking mess.  How the hell does he come up with this stuff?    I'm sorry I don't understand.  Could you expand upon your comment?    There is seriously no such thing as being a failure... that's the great thing about being a human being, so long as you're still alive and conscious, you can change everything.  You're not going to ruin your future by dropping out.  A degree doesn't guarantee you a job... tenacity, perseverance, and high standards do.  You need to think about how you would feel if you were dying right now looked back at your life.  Do you have regrets about how miserable you're making yourself going to college?  Think about it.  Those things you regret... work to change them.  You can do it!  I believe in you!     [I have a steel trap memory for weird political soundbytes](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/3a75dg/what_did_people_believe_in_the_1990s_that_we_no/cs9vx68) and [quite possibly the world's most homely Pekingese.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Unorthodog/comments/3btkfs/vampire/?ref=share ref_source=link)    Hey man;  I truly believe that the only graceful way to go bald is to shave it all.  You don't need to look like a potato, just grow some facial hair or wear your glasses.  If you really don't want to go for bald, your only real recourse it to trim it very close.  Washing your hair too often is probably the culprit for the shiny scalp.  It's fine to bathe or shower every day, but you don't need to wash your hair daily.  Try skipping it a few days and see if the shine goes away. Hope this helps!   P.S. I'm married to a guy who has been shaving his head since he was 20.  He's 39 now.  He looks very handsome and NOTHING like a potato.  It's really more about the way you dress than what's on your head, if you look put together, you're not going to look like a slob. :)   I definitely encourage you to do as many high school things as you can while you can... Go to prom, go to football games, join yearbook, do everything you can...   But if you can't make yourself be engaged with those kinds of things, take your list and work towards being every thing on it.  I bet that financial security, a home, steady income, food, I bet they're on that list in some way, shape, or form... how will you get those things if you don't have a high school education?  Beyond the basic requirements, I promise you will want THE BEST for your baby when you have one.  You're not going to want to be working towards a GED while your mother watches the baby and you're on government assistance (not that there is anything wrong with any of these things, when I was born, my mother was 21, homeless, in an abusive relationship, and on welfare).... it's just not the dream, you know?  You want your child to have a room and nice things and people she trusts and food in her belly and good Christmases... you want her to be smart and to be proud of her hardworking mother.  You want her to have a father who will build her up and make her believe she can do anything.   I'm coming from a similar place as you.  I was the oldest child of three and my home was broken.  From the time I was three I was thinking about building a family around me that would be mine and wouldn't go away.  I was engaged at 16 years old, I got a job and saved every single dime.  I graduated high school and immediately moved cross-state to support my fianc as he went through college.  We were together for almost four years, but he became abusive and I left him.  Every year was spent obsessively looking for the perfect father for my future children.  Looking back, I regret it.    But I've been married now for almost four years.  I have a very good job making about $20,000 more per year than the average woman in America, and I don't even have a college degree.  I have a house and two rescue dogs, and this past October, I welcomed a wonderful, healthy baby girl into the world.  I'm 28 years old.      I'm sorry that you're having trouble at home.  You don't deserve that kind of treatment.  To address your baby fever, I think you should sit down and make a list of all the things you would want for yourself if you could pick your ideal parents.  Be particular.  Pie in the sky, it's your dream list.  When you're done, look at your list and put a check mark next to all the things that you, personally, can provide to a baby.  Remember, that just like you, your baby can't choose its situation.  It's our responsibility to wait to have babies until we can give that child the best home we possibly can.  It's also our job to live our lives and have fun and to learn while we have the chance so we can use our rich experiences to stay engaged and enlighten our children once we have them.  Don't rush.  You have your whole life to be an adult and you will never be this young again.  Don't jump into being an adult, there is time for that.  So much time.  But this, this will never be again.     My advice is actually to sign on with a temp company. Temp companies are used to extremely high employee turnover, so they tend to skip doing background checks. Because a temp agency is supposed to run a background check, the company you are matched with will likely not do one. This is how my former company ended up with several level 1 sex offenders on the payroll. Let my disturbing experience be your boon! Best of luck to you... It's awesome that you're so driven. :)   If I were you, I would just borrow a ring she already has lying around that fits, bring it to a jewelry shop in town, and ask what size it is.  The charts are subject to user error because of print settings.     Sorry if this is a stupid question, but my rescue dog came to us with an enuculeation.. his face doesn't have any visible scarring or trauma, he just looks like he is winking all the time.  I don't want to bother any one, can you okay my dog?  http://i.imgur.com/OVztj69.jpg   Well, I'm not familiar (obviously, ahaha!) with the internal structure of your company, but here in my part of the world, we have procedures written for all important processes... anyone is free to suggest improvements to the VPs who run those departments.  Is it possible you could bring up this requirement as positively and humbly as possible to the person in charge of the marketing department?  I think if you spin it in the right (earnest, self-deprecating, company-minded) way, it will be well-received.     /u/late_night_grumbler He's pithy and hilarious and prolific.  He calls out the blatant pandering.  He's fair.  He's omniscient.  He circulates photos of Oscar the Grouch as gratuitous photos of himself... Yay for Grumbler.     Well, and how many people do you meet in your life that you think are good enough to marry?  It takes a long time for people when they have no limitation to their dating pool.  What are the odds that when you finally DO meet someone with Dwarfism that you are going to have one damn common interest with them?  It's beyond silly to have this expectation for you.  You do what you're doing!  I support you!    There it is!  I personally think she deserves an Oscar merely on merit of being able to perform in Twilight without busting into gales of laughter.

I just get back an e-mail saying "I made some edits, find attachment."  If you're asking because you're not in a position to be correcting the person's grammar due to org chart stuff, then you bring your edits to someone who is.  Just shoot their supervisor an e-mail stating that you found some errors but didn't think it was appropriate to bring them up being that you are in another department.    Well, thanks to an uneventful weekend and FX, I'll say she did the best she could with the material given to her... I mean, what the hell can you do when you are written a line like "You nick-named my child after the Loch Ness Monster?"  She had roles before and after!  This seems very insufficient to me.      My mother in law.  She's a terribly insecure person and it manifests in ways that would make me cut out any one else.     Kristen Stewart. I seriously don't understand the vitriol she draws on reddit... I mean, I bet the average redditor hasn't seen the Runaways, so maybe that's the closest thing I have to a theory. Can someone explain this to me? Where are these imaginary hoards of people who worship the ground she walks on? Because I never hear accolades that make her worthy of detraction...    Sounds to me like you should look into food service.  A lot of restaurants hire seasonal wait staff due to increased tourist traffic in the summer.  Dishwashers too if you're the shy type.  It's not going to be a whole lot of fun, but it's not hard to win a job. :) Good luck!    Show off your skills.... the truth is that on-paper qualifications just equate to higher starting pay... a lot of companies would prefer to pay you less for unofficial skills.  Go some place that you can get in at the ground level, but has a great ladder to climb.    You'll find that almost anything required in a job posting is open to negotiation depending upon your other good attributes.  I work as the executive assistant to the CEO and her Vice Presidents.  The job posting required two years of secretarial experience.  I did not have this.  They still hired me despite the fact that I was 6 months pregnant and would just have to be out for 3 months for maternity leave.  I've been here almost a year now!  I'm glad I took the risk, having really wanted the job. :)     Re-reading might be more your cup of tea.  Getting through a book used to be a challenge for me, but I loved to re-read things I did make it through.  I eventually grew out of it being difficult to finish things, but I'm still an avid re-reader. :)    Sorry, in searching his name the most recent thing I found was talk of a documentary 2 months ago... this didn't come up in that thread.  I swear, I'm not being some shameless re-poster.

I bought my mom's husband a subscription to CRAWL magazine for his birthday.  He's a very quiet mountain man type.  He sent me this very poorly punctuated text message that said "Got my first crawl mag today. thanks georgia. if your car pulls to one side or the other when you brake, let me know, il put pads on the other side next time."   I just don't even follow the line of logic here.... like so he's walking around all sloth like and doesn't have much to say... you already know off his meds he killed both of your family dogs... How, HOW is that behavior preferable to him being slovenly and uncommunicative?   We have *everything* in common.... "Dale Denton... You're my hero..."   This is just how I feel... I think his mother should have faced charges for taking him off his medications... I mean.... What the hell was she thinking?    Well, it's passed-out drunk to begin with, then it's restrained once it wakes up... I mean, it's just totally weird... The whole thing is weird... But I would imagine if I were a lady with a pig's face and people were paying to see how ugly I am, I'd be agitated too...so it works.     Yeah, having worked in a 4,000 sq. foot call center, the equivalent of this for me was people who refused to sit down.

[Pig-Faced Women](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pig-faced_women)  Favorite excerpt:The pig-faced women exhibited at fairs were not genuine. Showmen would drug a bear into a stupor by feeding it large amounts of strong beer, and then shave it.[60] Once shaved, the drunken bear would be fitted with padded artificial breasts, and dressed in women's clothing and a wig. Shoes would be attached to the bear's hind paws, and stuffed gloves to the front paws. The bear would then be placed in a chair with a hole in the back, and securely tied to the chair.[33]  Although, the bit about that heiress who couldn't dispel rumors that she WAS ONE even by appearing in public was pretty good too....

I'm reading Vampire: The Richard Chase murders, and right off the bat the author is going on and on about how evil Chase was... It was my understanding that he was a paranoid schizophrenic in a time when mental disorders were poorly understood... This author stands by the court findings that he was not insane (because he was paranoid? Uhhh...), but what do you think?

There was this disgruntled guy who was angry about something that happened many years ago with his utility company.  Several times a day, he would call the appliance repair line and then blow into the phone as hard as he could four times before hanging up.  It was damn near deafening... If you did a reverse search for his phone number in the system you could see he had been doing this since 2007.  They called him "Mr. Raspberry."   You don't know that.

There is a reason you're on my reddit friends list-- You never disappoint.    Hi... Here's how my experience was... The baby was born, they held her up to have her umbilical cord cut by my husband.  He said it was squishy, but incredibly tough to cut through. Then the baby was immediately put on my chest.  She wasn't even very wet.  They put my legs up in stirrups.  A bunch of personnel came to inspect my poor lady bits.  They assisted me in delivering the placenta (they tug gently on the umbilical cord while you push) they ask you if you want to inspect it (not kidding).  They took the baby from me, wrapped her up, popped a hat on her, and then gave her to my husband while they repaired a tear (gave me stitches for 30 minutes while my legs shook from shock and exertion).  When my husband held the baby the first time, he looked down at her face very seriously, and then he started smiling bigger and bigger.  It was such a great moment, it made me cry.     Me again...

Are you pulling my leg right now?    At what age is the paper crown and "king for a day" inappropriate?    I second this... Why is it that so many people post these, and are totally incommunicado after 55 minutes?  It's very disappointing!    [John Brennan Crutchley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Brennan_Crutchley) participated in orgies, partner swapping, frequented sex clubs.    I hope you're able to look beyond the terrible writing, because it is at times, painful.  The very first page is a ridiculous narrative about his "insatiable hunger" that he then "sates..." Uh... you said it was insatiable... Later on during the recounting of the rape of Christina Almah, the author actually describes her thighs as "silky.." like this is some damn letter to Penthouse.  I could go on and on, but I won't.       Conspiracy Theory Time: I think they only show these photos taken of him shortly before his death in 2002 because they're more in line with what we imagine when we think of a serial killer.  He was actually very conventionally attractive when he was active, that is how he got so many ladies to sleep with him... He kept an index card system with over 74 women he had sex with, and that, for the most part, did not include his victims.

You're not paying attention. This has already been addressed twice by me in this very same thread.    Right, it's a date of manufacture indicator for a Griswold skillet.   Apparently no one cares about Sir Anthony:  The knowledge that Anthony Hopkins had a short-lived career in the 1980's as a pop star. Here is his one and only single: [1986's Distant Star.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cz_mNW6S_w) You're welcome.   https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/3c6uoi/whats_something_thats_better_when_its_used_than/csswui8   [Here you go, friend.](http://sherylcanter.com/wordpress/2010/01/a-science-based-technique-for-seasoning-cast-iron/)  But to explain like you're five, seasoning is taking a non-coated cast iron pan, rubbing it with oil, cooking it in the oven so the oil becomes hard, taking it out, cooling it, repeating until it is shiny, smooth, and black.  This protects your cast iron from rust, and makes it less likely to have food stick to it.    [Here you go, friend.](http://www.moolanomy.com/5432/investing-in-collectibles-what-makes-a-collectible-valuable-mmarquit01/)  I don't have a great answer for you... it's all superstition, preference, and theory.    You're going to find that cast iron is one of those more controversial hobbies where everyone has a theory and no one has a definitive answer but that doesn't stop them from attacking each other.  The way that I do it (which is all I can tell you) is to use kosher salt and water to grind away any stuck on mess.  Once I have all the debris off of it, I put it in the oven at 200 degrees for 30 minutes to ensure it is completely dry.  The last thing I do is to very, VERY lightly oil it with a prop of olive oil.  It should be shiny, but not feel greasy.  I hope this helps...   Edit: You need to let the pan cool to room temp before oiling it and putting it away some place dry.  I should have specified... don't try to oil it while it's hot! :)   You might find what you're looking for here (Sorry, I didn't pre-screen, I'm trying to find a source for iron composition changes in manufacturing, and though I know I had a great time line I'd found in 2011, I am having the damnedest time finding it again.):   Howdy David, Well, you sure stirred up a storm with that question. The information I used was based on discussions with chemists, pieces written by chemists, and papers on the heat polymerization of oils in general (similar to drying oils but at elevated temperatures). When I went to look for a citation that specifically said here is what is going on in a cast iron pan, I couldnt find any. I spoke to McGee. He doesnt remember his conversation with you but we have vowed to run down the problem together. Here is the Royal Chemical Society speculating about oil polymerization: http://www.rsc.org/education/teachers/learnnet/kitchenchemistry/docs/SS10.doc Here is a (somwaht irrelevant) paper on the thermal gelation of thin oil films: http://ddr.nal.usda.gov/bitstream/10113/24641/1/IND23253053.pdf Lipid oxidation in general: http://ddr.nal.usda.gov/bitstream/10113/25421/1/IND81120598.pdf Iron (in meat) as a catalyst for oil polymerization: http://www.springerlink.com/content/ttt7t0414j11h611/?p=7638c2626be044c1a0c048c27874285d pi=7    I didn't buy it recently, I have Creddits pre Chooting...

 For the rest of his career?    Except Kelley was jawing at him before he was even out.    You mean the guy that put a grand slam 415 feet into right field?    That gum travelled down, and to the left. Down, and to the left.    I've tried craigslist, but there's a lot of bs you have to sift through order to find what you're looking for. Roommates.com doesn't have very many people in the area I'm moving to and you have to pay to use it. What other options are out there?   At our store, we're more concerned about a candidate's ability to drive sales, get along with coworkers and provide good customer service to our customers than we are about their knowledge of books. Our interview questions generally begin with, "Describe a time when..." We carry 2 million titles in the store, so even the most voracious reader won't be very familiar with the vast majority of what we sell. We're looking for team players who are friendly to customers and don't shy away from the selling aspect of the job (we are there to make money, after all). Good luck!    Is it for Barnes and Noble? I'm a manager and can let you know what to expect?    If you think Blood Meridian is the best book you've ever read, just wait until the ending. Then you'll *know* it's the best book you've ever read.    Realized as soon as I clicked "submit". Hoped no one would notice.    I always do this. A few chapters into a new book I'll hear or read about a different book and I just can't wait to read it. So much so that the book I'm currently on becomes more of a chore than a pleasure.    I love [this beef stew recipe]( http://www.reddit.com/r/slowcooking/comments/15ggl9/the_ultimate_well_my_favourite_beef_stew_recipe/?). Only I use green beans instead of peas and I add worcestshire sauce.    He can only get the win or the loss.    I'm so over this game, but I've come this far. I have to see the end.    Sold out online, but I just placed an order in store.    He was 24 when he died today and this yearbook photo would be from his senior year in high school, so 17 or 18 years old.    Is that just for rent or does it include utilities?       What's to keep a True Detective writer, who knows the outcome, from betting a huge sum of money on this and completely wiping out Bovada?    Get a magnetic strip at a craft store and stick to to the back of the sticker. That way you could even take it off if you don't want to display it at certain times.    That fuckhead racist Jim Webb.    K   Just who is he tying to pander to here. This seems like a statement that, even if you believe it, is better left unsaid, especially for a politician.    I'm sure many of you either participated in or at least saw the Facebook event last Saturday for a letter writing campaign. The goal was to get as many Bernie supporters as possible to write a letter to the editor of their local paper stating why they support him for president. This was a fun and quick (most newspapers have a 200 word limit) way to potentially reach a lot of people.    Why don't we do the same thing, but send the letters to various papers in Iowa? I guess the letters are supposed to be submitted by locals, but I don't think that's a requirement. Imagine if, this Sunday, every newspaper in Iowa has at least one letter to the editor in support of Bernie Sanders. That could potentially make a difference in the race.    Unfortunately, that woman's views are quite common here. This is the most conservative county in California.    [Here](http://www.auburnjournal.com/article/7/06/15/reader-input-sanders-fights-workers)   The formatting is a little weird, but it finally made it into the paper, albeit on a Tuesday where it will be seen by literally dozens of people.     I'm no political scientist, but I suspect Iowa is hugely important for Hillary because New Hampshire is likely to be won by Bernie. If he wins Iowa and then wins New Hampshire, it could be devastating for Hillary.    Two nights ago it was in the 5000s.    I think the rating would only make a difference if it cracked the top 10. Since it's one of the top political books right now though, it might appear on random Amazon users' pages if they are buying similar books.    You mean the audio book ;-)   Lol what's dialling long distance?    The book is called *[The Speech]( http://www.amazon.com/Speech-Historic-Filibuster-Corporate-Decline/dp/1568586841/ref=sr_1_1?s=books amp;amp;amp;amp;ie=UTF8 amp;amp;amp;amp;qid=1436225392 amp;amp;amp;amp;sr=1-1 amp;amp;amp;amp;keywords=the+speech amp;amp;amp;amp;pebp=1436225399941 amp;amp;amp;amp;perid=07DT3YP2MBYN1BBA8K1T#featureBulletsAndDetailBullets_secondary_view_div_1436226426666)* and is the publication of an 8 hour long filibuster Senator Sanders gave on the Senate floor regarding the extension of the Bush tax cuts in 2010.    The book is less than $10 and **all authorial proceeds are donated to charity**. Consider it your good deed for the day AND you get an excellent book out of it.    Also, I can't confirm this, but another user mentioned that putting the book in your cart will raise its rank on Amazon even if you don't buy it.    Lastly, Bernie has another book called *[Outsider in the House](http://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/1859841775/ref=pd_aw_sbs_14_4?refRID=12267PXWT3J0095Q5C2P)*, currently #924,515 on Amazon, although it appears to be out of print.    Umm...it actually looks like you can afford to donate 54k   /s   Someone linked to it last night while it was in the 5,000s.    It's jumped over 3000 spots on the Amazon bestseller list since last night.    Someone should post [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6I1-r1YgK9I amp;feature=youtube_gdata_player) of her speaking out AGAINST gay marriage. Either this one or a more recent one from 2008.    Honestly, I don't see a reason why GMOs should be labeled. Science has shown that they're safe.    I joined. I live in Auburn and would like to start/join a group for Placer County as well.    Sneaking down to the first row behind the basket with my mom...and then getting told to go back to our seats a quarter later.   2082 now. It has jumped 3000 spots in less than 24 hours.    Edit: 1931 now!    How many people are expected to turn up tonight?    Awesome! What a great experience to share with your dad!    Didn't even know he had a book. I'll order it tomorrow at Barnes  amp; Noble.    Edit: It's at 4440 now!   I took a lit class that focused on magical realism. We read *Beloved*, *Pobby and Dingan*, *As I Lay Dying* and *Of Love and Other Demons*.    That kind of defeatist attitude makes me mad. It's better to show up and fail than give up.    I've been looking for a succinct, but substantive, video to share on Facebook as well. I'll be keeping an eye on this post. [This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7L9V7oGRv8 amp;feature=youtube_gdata_player) is the best one I've found.    Check [this link](http://www.sanders.senate.gov/agenda/) out. It's taken straight from his website and lays out what he calls 12 Steps Forward. Let me know if I can clarify anything.    I was hoping there was a group already in place, but it doesn't look like it. I think I'll start one. I'm going to look into getting a banner printed this week and then do some tabling. I'm in Auburn btw.    What part of CA? I'm in the Sac area.    He's been very vocal lately in his opposition to the US leading the war against ISIS. He believes an Arab coalition, led by Saudi Arabia, should take them on.    I've never contributed to a politician before. I finally bit the bullet a couple weeks ago and donated to Bernie. Today, I made my second contribution...and bought a t-shirt.    I eventually would like to start a Bernie group, but I live in a small, conservative city, so I need to recruit some members first. I think I could gather some interest if I post up outside of a grocery store and try to get email addresses of potentially interested people. Is there a way to get the necessary supplies to do this? Really all I want to start with is a Bernie 2016 banner that I can put on the table so people know what I'm about.    Whitewater   I've never done it before, but a couple friends and I want to try it. Where's the best place to go?   I know it's early and we're still behind in the polls, but I think it's very reasonable to think Bernie has a great chance to win in Iowa and New Hampshire. He's only down 19 in Iowa with 7 months to go before the Iowa caucus. He still hasn't even had a debate with Hillary, which, when it does happen, will help Bernie in the polls.    You've already received some good answers, but I want to provide another perspective. Look at [this chart]( https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2delGcbK8FF7ck_fgtGWaA1iE5c=/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3657424/bernie_hillary_donations.png) showing who the largest donors to Hillary and Bernie are throughout their careers. You'll notice that Hillary receives most of her money from large corporations like Citigroup, Goldman Sachs JPMorganchase, and Lehman Brothers. In fact, almost every donor on the list is a major corporation. Compare that list to the list of Bernie's donors, which are almost all worker's unions.    Organizations donate to political campaigns as an investment. They think the rewards they get from having their candidate elected will be greater than their initial investment. Now I don't know your situation, but I would guess that you, as I and most Americans do, would benefit more from the success of laborers, engineers, teachers and machinists than you would from the success of Citigroup, Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley.    If you want to know who a politician will be loyal to, just look at who their major donors are.    But how does she feel about peas in her guacamole?    Here is a list of email addresses to most newspapers in Maine. Bernie will be speaking in Portland on July 6. Let these papers know that you want them to cover it.    jmyers@independentpub.com  info@keepmecurrent.com  duhoux2@tds.com  neteditor@rumfordfallstimes.com  advertising@freepressonline.com  gfish@thepenobscottimes.com  awood@advertiserdemocrat.com  don.eno@sjvalley-times.com  tessie.dubois@sjvalley-times.com  news@lincnews.com  yorkweekly@seacoastonline.com  yccs@seacoastonline.com  newsletter@seacoastonline.com  hamptonunion@seacoastonline.com  news@rochestertimes.com  news@fosters.com  gorhamtimes@gmail.com  editor@thefranklinjournal.com  mmehlsak@theforecaster.net  kwood@theforecaster.net  dcostello@sunjournal.com  news@mdislander.com  news@ellsworthamerican.com  qtides@midmaine.com  news@easterngazette.com  observer@nepublish.com  editor@capecourier.com  theenterpr@aol.com  news@timesrecord.com  bnews@roadrunner.com  news@boothbayregister.com  news@pbp.com  mejtcommunity@journaltribune.com  news@inthecourier.com  news@bethelcitizen.com  yournews@themaineedge.com  jluetjen@bangordailynews.com  smonroe@centralmaine.com  mmilliken@centralmaine.com   Thanks to /u/s_all_Goodman for compiling the list.    Good idea trying to get it stickied. We have 55,000 subscribers here. If we can get just 10,000 of those people to use #Bernie2016 on Instagram or other social media outlets at 3:00 EST on Sunday it won't go unnoticed. Try messaging the mods about it.   My advice is to only ask people to use one hashtag and to make it #Bernie2016. People will throw in other hashtags that they like, but #Bernie2016 is simple an it gets our message across.    I changed that part of it for Reddit. I signed my real name on the actual email.    Is this something you're planning on your own or is this a more widespread thing? We would probably be able to mobilize more Bernie supporters if we planned the same thing for a few days from now. How about Sunday, so it coincides with our plan to write letters to the editors of our local newspapers?   Exactly. I guarantee there are a lot of Hillary supporters who are loyal Democrats who simply feel like she is the only candidate with a serious chance of winning. As Bernie continues to rise in the polls, many of those people will jump ship and join Bernie.    One of the biggest problems we face is the lack of media coverage. Writing letters to the media will go a long way in resolving this, but it's also important that we thank those websites that do cover Bernie by giving them their clicks. At the end of the day, websites are trying to get views and they will notice if they get an abnormally high number of views every time they post a Bernie story. When this happens, we can expect to see more coverage. So, don't just read the headlines on the front page. Actually visit the website; comment if you have the time. Make it a smart business decision for websites to cover the campaign.    Below are the email addresses of most newspapers in Maine. Be sure to let them know how eager you are to read about the rally the day after. You only need to write one email and BCC to all of the papers.    jmyers@independentpub.com  info@keepmecurrent.com  duhoux2@tds.com  neteditor@rumfordfallstimes.com  advertising@freepressonline.com  gfish@thepenobscottimes.com  awood@advertiserdemocrat.com  don.eno@sjvalley-times.com  tessie.dubois@sjvalley-times.com  news@lincnews.com  yorkweekly@seacoastonline.com  yccs@seacoastonline.com  newsletter@seacoastonline.com  hamptonunion@seacoastonline.com  news@rochestertimes.com  news@fosters.com  gorhamtimes@gmail.com  editor@thefranklinjournal.com  mmehlsak@theforecaster.net  kwood@theforecaster.net  dcostello@sunjournal.com  news@mdislander.com  news@ellsworthamerican.com  qtides@midmaine.com  news@easterngazette.com  observer@nepublish.com  editor@capecourier.com  theenterpr@aol.com  news@timesrecord.com  bnews@roadrunner.com  news@boothbayregister.com  news@pbp.com  mejtcommunity@journaltribune.com  news@inthecourier.com  news@bethelcitizen.com  yournews@themaineedge.com  jluetjen@bangordailynews.com  smonroe@centralmaine.com  mmilliken@centralmaine.com   I would say 33% on July 2 puts us ahead of schedule. Most of us expect, reasonably I would say, to get another bump in the polls once the debates start. There's also the fact that Biden, who has shown no signs of running is at 7%. Who are those 7%? Could they be polling for Biden as an anti-Hillary protest. I suspect that those 7% could easily switch to Bernie supporters, assuming Biden doesn't jump into the race late.    Here's mine: short and sweet.    Good afternoon,   Due to a prior commitment, I was unable to watch the live stream of Bernie Sanders' campaign rally in Madison last night. I figured I would still be able to read about it this morning in the NYT. Disappointinly, there wasn't a single mention of the event in today's paper. This is shocking because an estimated 10,000 people attended the rally, making it the largest campaign event for any candidate this election season. Senator Sanders is rising in the polls and is making the race for the Democratic Party nomination very interesting. In the future, please provide some form of coverage of rallies that draw crowds this large, for any candidate. It's a noteworthy achievement and a possible indicator of an exciting race this year.    Thank you, test_subject5967   He basically replants his right leg before the pitch this year.    I got Eugenio Velez, but forgot Angel Pagan.       What's going on around town this Saturday?

But can you make it do [this]( http://assets.sbnation.com/assets/1208411/kershaw.gif)?   Only if you can also throw the ball 90+ MPH exactly where you want it to go.    I doubt they will trade Belt, especially since Aoki is only signed through this year.    As far as I know, there is no active Sanders group in Placer County. I would like to be a part of one, but, since I work fulltime, I won't be able to devote the necessary time to the campaign. Is there anyone else in the area that would be interested in working with me to get a group going?    I saw the headline when I was on my work break this morning and began to sweat out of my eyes.    The closest major city is Sacramento, but I actually live about 40 minutes northeast in Placer County.    Similarly, is there a way to check to see if a Sanders group already exists in my area?   Machi looking DIRTY that inning!    Sweet! You met Curt Schilling.    For what purposes are they used? I'm a little concerned about my political activities getting back to my employer.    I haven't found a "real" job yet, although I haven't seriously looked. I'm still working the same retail job I started when I was 18. I was recently promoted to a lead position and I have an interview this week for a manager position. I don't want to make a long term career out of this job, but I figure it can't hurt to be able to put "manager" on future resumes.    In the meantime, what can I do to make myself a desirable applicant in the future? The problem is I don't know what I want to do, so I can't tailor my skill set to my dream job. What are the skills I should teach myself or experience I should get if my goal is to land a 30k+ job within one year?    I apologize if this question gets asked a lot, which I assume it does.

 Yes they are. If I hadn't have seen the pair they'd be perfect.   Loved Animal Kingdom. Love anything with Ben Mendelssohn for that matter.   I'll check out A Touch of Sin. Thanks.   Movies like Collateral, No Country for Old Men, Haywire, Bourne, even John Wick where there is tension and quiet broken by "professional" violence, where the action is mechanical and feels like something ordinary for the actor really get my attention.

The Nightcrawler fight is the best sequence in the whole movie.  Also, the new Bond movies, and most Tarantino movies.   Wow I didn't realize how much people didn't like that. I guess if you don't put "/s" after something blatantly not serious the hoard jumps on you.   They have a really polarizing sense of humor. My favorite is Burn After Reading, but really all their films are worthwhile and often darkly comedic.   Another great Caine quote on the matter:  "*Now I never saw Jaws 3, but I saw the house that Jaws 3 bought, and it is quite beautiful.*"   Soderbergh. His style works so well across genres.  Also, Spielberg and the Coen brothers.  The Coens may not seem it, but watch No Country for Old Men and then Raising Arizona or any of their funnier films back to back, and I bet you'd agree.   I'm Gazorpazor-fucking-field, bitch.   Now give me my fucking enchiladas.   lol "the bomb"  because terrorists are often brown   I love the end of Burn After Reading, too.

Not necessarily a lie, but a pretty thoroughly multi-faceted scene that shouldn't just be taken at face value.   That seems like a pretty fuckin stupid idea   http://www.rockabilia.com/kanye-west-ballerina-t-shirt-f1cb07196bc5e3b26245ae46b20dd17f.html    Hey Steven, I imagine you're reading this, so just to let you know I haven't extensively looked into any of your theories and I don't necessarily believe that you are Christ, but you seem very confident, so just in case, what can I do to get off this FEMA Detention list?

 Thanks man, and congrats! Hope you enjoy it as much as I enjoy mine :)   Pretty much, a bit of a homemade slaw and it's actually a cilantro aioli :) Toasted bun lightly brushed with melted butter also   Was pretty good thanks for asking, I've been eating super healthy the last month so my body was craving something like this lol   Birdie.   Nice, fellow Ontarian too :P      As a fellow Canadian also, thank you for the greeting. Hope you're having a great day :)   lol, it's fast enough for me...for now.

I wouldn't mind a WRX or STi someday but this does the trick for the time being :)  	14
 Yeah, im just curious as to what the ash is.      Stumbled across this thanks to someone on twitter. Looks like some black magic shit. Honestly has no idea. I recently found a youtube channel related to a name that's tied to the website. Their only video can be found [here(WARNING LOUD SOUNDS)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SM90-L2g0tc). Its quite disturbing honestly. I also searched the website to find that same image. It was titled "Help me". In the archive of the website there seems to be a video capture that was deleted. I havent found a way to access it.      i ahv played fnaf4 and fnaf7 and i ve seen th fnaf movie scatt is my broter   oh yeah.  oops.   Anyone notice the eyes moving outside the window while Chica was down the hall?   his voice being prepubescent adds to the beauty of a fnafcringe game.  	8
 So then I started dreaming that I was lucid dreaming because I was before I "woke" up even though since I woke up it broke it and I'm not actually lucid but just dreamt that I was.  Anyone ever had this happen before?   Maybe, maybe. I go back to Uni in a month and a bit. They aren't like bedbugs in that they infest and follow you fucking everywhere, or?    Yeah? My room has had problems with mold. I don't really have anywhere else to put my books though. Nowhere that they wouldn't be "in the way".   I'm not really looking on ways to get rid of them because I'm lazy and am satisfied with just blowing/wiping them away at the start of each reading session.   However, what is with them? They just appear. I read that they are common on old books, so why are they on my copy of The Casual Vacancy, that I bought back in February or some equally dismal month.  They do give me a bit of anxiety though, nothing major, but just the expectation of seeing them as I'm scanning each paragraph. I know they're not harmful to humans but I have a thing with bugs. My main issue is spiders. Just last week I was minding my own and  reading "The Five People You Meet In Heaven" by Mitch Albom in my bed and this spider struts up to me on my pillow, and I recoil. Good book though, sorta depressing but I enjoyed it.  So, yeah. What are your experiences with booklice or other insects?      why is lego so expensive :(   You're a whore.   shouldn't have to ask.  why is such an old lady in an airport anyway, what is she even up to, go back to bed and watch your fucking soaps  ARGHHH   No, no. /u/dillwillhill is correct. Minecraft is a bitch to get the mods working.   They're murderers. Fuck 'em.   He's not ACTUALLY going to murder anyone. Calm your many tits, fatboy.   To be fair, it's not like the shit on askreddit has copyright attached to it, and if someone wants to grab the ideas and make an entertaining video... whats the deal?  It's like flaming /u/Shitty_Watercolour for illustrating someone's comment.   Except, Mecca is a city with, as the OP said, a lot of historical value attached to it. People are going to be interested in it and these people aren't all going to be muslim.  Comparing it to the Queen of England's private residence is a bit of a leap.   mad   scarves are weird    same   same   Hahaha! Where you from? It's a common variant where I live.   whatever, rube.   DAMIAN RISES!         No Barbara? *sigh*  Hope that idiot Blaine paid for that book he destroyed, also hope he doesn't ever drive again, because shit me, did he hit someone?   What a sly dog   Yeah, that's what I'm saying. The dick pics are harassment and absolutely uncalled for.  The rest I found funny.    This guy is awesome,  but I think he went a bit too far with sending unsolicited dick pics.  But the satire and making fun of SJWs had me cracking up;  "Did i trigger you"  "You're an obese tumblrina..." etc, that whole section was great.  and then the ending  "The patriarchy is watching ;)"  You played right into his hands and gave him what he wanted: a beautiful reaction.   NO MEG?!   NO MEG?!   Cool.  *waits for the next shitstorm*   You're not missing much, it's sticky and moist and gross and... and... *bursts into tears*   Nobody NEEEEEEEDS a haircut, you fascist.    Yeah, then you get viruses and have your account nicked :(   WHICH COMMENT DID I DOWNVOTE? DIDN'T DOWNVOTE /U/RANDOM-REFERENCE COMMENT AT LEAST, AND WHEN HIS COMMENT CAME THERE WERE NO OTHER COMMENTS TO DOWNVOTE SO BE MY GUEST AND TELL ME. I GUESS YOU BELONG IN THE BOX WHERE THE OTHER SHITSTORM STARTERS CAME FROM. SHOO. GO BACK IN YOUR BOX AND NEVER COME OUT.

The Psychopath Test by Jon Ronson, and there's some little test but even that isn't a good indicator IIRC.   ASMR?   *slowly raises hands like Walter White*  Ya' got me.  *grins*  But, nah. Do you think I am a psychopath?    Oh man, tamer than what I imagined. So, uh, what scenario lead you to finding out you were into this?   Hamid is a name, aye. Zwalisan, no idea, just pulled it out of my ass. And, woah, woah, woah! I'm not the psychopath here, I'm not the OP.    What does this ear fetish involve?   It's an affectionate term, Zwalisan. Calm down.   "Bae," Urban Dictionary says, is an acronym that stands for "before anyone else," "   Alright, Hamid. Can't be too careful now can I?   The women that you date. Are they bae?  	81
 Wow, honestly that's the best one I've heard on this so far. Seeing a genuinely human side of someone you consider a hero/icon can be such an endearing experience.    Good to know, mucho gracious   Yup   The purpose of this was more to what 3 books would you want to shape a new civilization with.  You didn't ruin any fun, I should have phrased the question better.   Love the way this is illustrated, particularly the bottom half.  1992 is favorite for me.   Holy shit that sounds amazing, would have loved to be in that crowd.   I was originally going to say most profitable, but am honestly not sure considering MLB gets 160+ games of TV money and NBA 80+. Agree that per game isn't the best comparison but didn't want to spend the time researching the other stats.   I'm definitely with you on that last part.   The NFL makes the most per game profit margins over any other American sport and yet it's players are compensated the least.    The NFL is easily the most injury-inducing, particularly of the career ending and mentally impairing variety , sport in America, yet its the only one that doesn't provide players with post-career health insurance.   For me, the most fun part about going to football games is the tailgate. I'm sure you could find a bus/bbq package or something you could get in on over the internet.   You should definitely go to the game. NO is an awesome community and that should be a terrific matchup this year.   Strong to moderately strong   What are you talking about? The photos we have are magnificent. We've used IMAX cameras to film the Earth is literally the best we're capable of.   You'd probably like this book, http://www.amazon.com/The-Andromeda-Strain-Michael-Crichton/dp/006170315X   Someone wrote an article a couple years back about how absurd his numbers would be if he had more talented QBs throwing to him throughout his career. No offense meant to who the Panthers had pre-Cam, but he'd be a shoe-in HOFer by now for sure.   Todd Terje's "It's Album Time"  The Prodigy's "Fat of the Land"  I'll just put each album on shuffle, been doing it all year so far.   Probably the most valuable contribution ESPN has made to modern culture.   Ridiculous hypothetical, I know. And obviously books on engineering or medicine would be quite valuable but this would specifically be aimed at literary works.   I can only see technology improving safety by changing the style of helmets, something that would limit the movement of the head/neck areas. Something like this would probably limit each players range of motion, possibly resulting in less acrobatic plays. I don't see Defenses ever going back to the older style of hitting at this point, the trajectory the league is on is to make hits less violent, I don't see that trend changing, whether or not its better/worse for the game.     Posting up on my couch for 10 hours straight every Sunday with a bag of Popeyes chicken and a 12-pack of Brooklyn Lager.   Might have some interesting feedback by posting this in r/physics or r/philosphy   http://www.businessinsider.com/why-the-rocks-ballers-can-use-nfl-logos-without-consent-2015-6  They might actually sidestep it if they're slippery enough.   Great idea   Marshawn was truly born into the wrong era. God must know he effed up by not having him wreak havoc in Roman gladiator pits.   We STOMPED- YOU OUT!!!   Its pretty much become impossible not to like him.   Almost looks like I'm watching a movie when I see that, so surreal.   So close to being a brilliant play.   Easily my favorite book, I don't think there's any way the last two top it. So many storylines hit climactic moments in it.   ...Wow, I've been spelling it wrong for years.   That's a tremendous gif. Who is this?   Your probably waking up pretty dehydrated like most people, which is probably making your muscles pretty cramped. Combine this with having your body being completely stationary for the last 8 or so hours and you're gonna have a bumpy start.   I'd say just keep getting up and doing it, your body will naturally make the adjustments and adapt.   Whether it be a moment during an interview, a play on the field, anything.      -Rickon is not dead, but given the attachment the reader has to him at this point he may as well not have been born.  -To your second point, like you said everyone believes Bran and Rickon to be dead. It would be a stretch for a bastard to claim the throne of Winterfell, but at this point he's the last remaining Stark.  -The reader is meant to be unsure about Clegane. Most would assume he's dead, but many are also hoping he somehow survived, we don't know at this point in the story.  Congrats on finishing the book, its a tome so don't feel bad that it took a long time.  EDIT: Spelling   Do they have storefronts that offer you cash at horrendous interest rates? Obviously its not a good option, but may be useful as a last resort. I see them pretty frequently in the U.S.   Thanks, definitely going to try this out.   Thanks, will be going digging in there this weekend for sure.   Nice, neat idea   I don't have it unfortunately. Are you aware of any inexpensive alternatives?   That definitely looks like the most well done technique. Not sure if I have the chops to pull it off but only one way to find out.   Thanks for the reply- I watched almost all of this guy's videos last night. Tremendous stuff.   ...I want this. Can you share how you made it?   In the particular shot I want:  1) Man reaches into pocket.  2) Text message screen on iphone is shown. Audience is meant to read content.  3) Man grimaces, shakes head, puts phone away.  As of now, I have a still screenshot of the text message sandwiched between the two action scenes. It looks pretty amateur, any suggestions?   Bout damn time!   I was starting to wonder if I'd run out of creative ways to lose my hard earned money, yet it seems an intriguing option has appeared...   Specifically one that's professional, so not someone filming on their phone. I know they usually show this of players at the beginning of game recaps, specifically on opening day or if they had a particularly good/bad day. And I'm sure there's clips of it in some of the recent America's Games.   That being said, was hoping someone might know of the top of their head before I spend time digging through the possibilities.  Go Giants.   Why did you make such an utterly misleading title? He never once mentions his health, his age, or his possible death.   Would help to search things like "first project" within the sub and you'll probably find a lot of good suggestions. Would also just start googling "mini-bar project plans", things like that.   There'll probably be a contingent of peeps telling you that this is too ambitious and that you should start with something simple like a box or table. Personally I think diving straight in to what you want to make can be an incredible learning experience, regardless of the obstacles and mistakes you'll make.   Tweezer Reprise 10/31/10 puts me in the ZONE.   Whether or not they deserve it, shouting at people isn't how you make/keep friends. Communicate your feelings to the person in a calm manner, if they aren't with your time than move on, but behaving childishly isn't going to make spending time with you inviting.   Gonna have some tough love here. It sounds like you're in difficult situation, but it also sounds like you've been making excuses for yourself for quite some time.   No matter how bad the job might be, working regularly is a great source of pride and independence. You'll find just doing this for a small period of time will make your realize how capable you are and open up other avenues to you. Having an ambition to be a comic book writer/artist is awesome, and its something that can be pursued and developed in your free time. There's a lot of good resources out there on where to begin with something like that.  I'd suggest going on Craigslist and seeing what's available, start narrowing it down from there.   Robert Heinlein wrote a book based on this exact situation and its pretty incredible.  The Moon is a Harsh Mistress. http://www.amazon.com/The-Moon-Is-Harsh-Mistress/dp/0312863551  It's also a terrific audio book if you're into that.   Why would a partner be essential? I do them alone plenty as long as I'm not pushing a crazy amount of weight.   I'm in the same boat as you, haven't made a real effort to balance myself out until recently. Sounds like u/statuscrow is hitting the nail on the head though.   Looks great   You've got to unplug yourself. Walk around, explore, exercise is a terrific tool like some on here have mentioned. What you like to do will come to you, but it only comes with action. You have to focus on the external in order to grow internally. If you're constantly assessing and reflecting inwardly you'll stagnate your growth.   I bought a D3300 to start out with and have been learning a ton while messing around with it. That being said it cost me around $500, you could probably afford something more advanced.   You could try getting a small loan from LendingClub.com.  Depending on your area, if you religiously checked Craigslist every day you could find enough gigs that within a few weeks where you could accumulate the money.   Thanks for your reply. The US does have this, and I believe it is free if you fall under a certain income bracket. Is that what you personally though? My concern is that the government software or something like Turbo Tax is probably the least lucrative in earning the most back each year.   That is a fair point. To me, since there are substantial populations of fan bases that don't participate in social media or purchase merchandise, something like this is naturally going to be skewed.    This study is only using two metrics to account for "fandom", one of them being social media use. Its ridiculous to calculate something like this in the first place, but the method they used was just lazy.   Through your attorney, through an online tool like turbo tax, simply by yourself or something else?   Wow   Only company I could find was Sportech PLC which trades on the London exchange. Any competitors, specifically that trade on the NYSE that anyone is aware of?  http://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/snapshot/snapshot.asp?ticker=SPO:LN  EDIT: To clarify I'm not referring to sites like DraftKings or Fanduel. Specifically software that operates things like Off Track Betting in bars, and could potentially expand when new legislation is past.   Talk about what you feel like talking about and ignore the inner monologue that keeps questioning whether what you're discussing is "interesting" or "compelling". Once you start naturally talking about things, even if it's just an instinctual undeveloped opinion, it will sounds interesting because you'll have even somewhat of a passion behind it. Short version: Don't think, just talk.   Your landlord cannot do that. Tell them you aren't leaving, there's a good chance they wouldn't want to go through the nightmare of taking it to court especially when you are in the right.   Do it. You don't need your Mom's permission, like literally you don't. Be your own person.   Looked up highlights to watch Jordy in action and the peeps in this thread are right.  Hope my Jints fans remember how beast Amani Toomer was at these.   Chocolate or Vanilla. They both taste delicious and mix well with things like peanut butter and fruit. If you're anti-sweeteners I can understand going for the unflavored, but when a protein powder actually tastes good you look forward to having it way more.   Amazon or Ebay are pretty effective.   Seems like the cops acted pretty reasonably as far as I'm concerned.  	70

    Audio sounds great and I'm really loving the vlog! Great job :D   Ahhhhhh I hope I win !!   I have to admit.. adding a slice of american cheese in korean ramen is pretty tasty.  There's even an Army Base Tofu Stew that has hot dogs and cheese.  Delicious! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euVyBKNfxkk   Yes!  "Let me setup Netflix for you" would be nice too lol.   Mine rises days before, and drops as soon as it starts.   They're both on :(   Damn you vacationers! lol.  I can't wait for September to show up.  Thank you so much, and congratulation on your 6th year in owning a retail business!   Hurry up September! lol   Yeah it seems like Summers are slow for everyone :(     My legs turned into jelly for a moment....   Thank you so much for your tip!  I hope our sales trend will be like yours.  I can't even imagine what the Fall is going to be like... I'm excited!   Thank you so much!    Crossing my fingers!!  GO Reddit!   lol definitely not.  We did shows and festivals up till now, so I wasn't sure what it would be like to be in a regular retail environment :)     Phew, thank you so much for your reply.  Everyone keeps telling us that things start picking up in Fall, but nobody mentions summer lol.  Running a business is hard! lol   Hi everyone, we have a small bath and body products business in Los Angeles, and I've noticed that sales have been a bit slower this month.  Sales have been climbing for us every month since March, but suddenly I'm finding June to be really slow.  Is it just me lol? This is our first year in retail so I have no idea what types of sales trends are normal.  Thank you ahead of time!   Omg those are the best!   Hi everyone!  My husband and I finally were able to get a plot in our community garden (yayyyyy)!  We've never gardened before (outside of succulents grown in containers on our balcony), so we're unsure of what we should do next.  Currently there are things growing in our plot, but I really want to pull everything out, build some raised beds, and start growing some delicious vegetables.    Here is an instagram photo of what's currently growing in our plot: https://instagram.com/p/1RT2cNkMgd  We are in Zone 10a :)  Thank you for your help!!   My call notifications are definitely on because I do get notified about 50% of the times for incoming calls.  You definitely were not being a smart ass lol.  That's a legitimate question lol.   I've never ever recieved 1 text message from my iPhone.  Just upgraded to an iPhone 6+ 2 weeks ago and it's the same :(. I've just accepted it.   Dear Zachary... :(   Crossing my fingers!   Hi everyone! I have a large round pedestal table already and would like to make a few smaller cake stands to stack on top just like the pink ones in the picture. I figured I could purchase the round wooden plates pre-cut from Home Depot, but I can't seem to find the legs. I have seen a few thick candle holders, but nothing tall enough. Any help would be appreciated! Thank you DIY :)  picture: http://i.imgur.com/llARDEn.jpg   Crossing my fingers!   Wow 5 days without a charge?  That's really great.  I've definitely ended my workout so it's not the GPS.  It's comfortable and I really like wearing it.  Right now I'm just trying to figure out the notifications situation.   My husband purchased my surge from a target in Portland I believe.  He called around and couldn't find any near us in Southern California.   I agree.  It must be because I've kept my HR monitor on auto.  I use the GPS tracker 3-4x a week so I'm sure that doesn't help either.  I've just been so happy with my Force that suddenly having to charge so often has been kind of a bummer lol.   The notifications have still been a problem.  The GPS situation has definitely been fixed.  It's because I've been clicking quick start instead of having the GPS actually connect.   I just figured out my problem with the GPS. I've been clicking quick start to start my gps.  But now I stand on the street and wait until the GPS has been found and then go.  So far it seems like it's been working perfectly.   You're so right.  The charger does seem to click off the fitbit really easily.  I've been charging it until it says full on my app but maybe I should leave it connected a little longer?   I don't have GPS on all the time.  I have noticed that with my last battery charge, it's lasted about 3 days before I received an email from fitbit.     Hey guys! My husband bought me a Fitbit Surge for Christmas and I thought Id let you know my experience wearing it so far.   Band: The band is thick on my wrist, but its quite comfortable.  The closure is like a regular watch so theres no need to worry about it undoing itself.  There is also a piece that slips over the extra watch flap and locks it down. This way you dont have to worry about all that extra watch band hanging over if your wrist is thin.  Ive been wearing it all day and only taking it off to shower. So far I havent experienced the gross smell that most watch bands usually give.  Clock face:  Its big and very easy to navigate.  The backlight is great, but I have found myself tapping it a few times at night for the light to come on.  The swiping is easy, but sometimes I find that its displaying other screens except for the time.  Im sure its because Ive touched it on accident or something.  Perhaps there is a way to lock the screen on clock?  Music control: Love running spotify on my phone and being able to control it with my watch.    Text/Call notification:  I have yet to receive a single text on my watch.  I have however been notified 1 out of 10 incoming calls.  Ive reset it once so maybe I'll have to do it again.   Heart rate: I havent tested the accuracy, but its been pretty fun to see what my heart rate is throughout the day and night.  I have noticed that on some nights my pulse is 10 points lower than on other nights.  Is that normal?   GPS: The GPS is a little wacky.  Ive only used it 2x but both times the google map drawing was completely off.  Ill use it a few more times before I write to fitbit.    *Battery: Charging seems to only take an hour, but man does this thing have a terrible battery life.  I charged it till it was full yesterday afternoon and it's already showing that it's 1/2 way through right now.  Is this happening to anyone else with the Surge?  I'm so sad because when I wore the Force it seemed it last forever!   Thats it so far.  If you guys have any questions Id be more than happy to answer them :)  *edited to add the note on battery life   Crossing my fingers! :D   What an ungrateful biotch!  That just had to be said.     Thank you so much fraenk! I am getting visits from forum12343.darodar :(  They seem to be visiting 10-15x a day.  ehhhhhh   I just sent you a message :)  Thank you!   It's not coming from co.lumb.co.  It's going to co.lumb.co, but it shows that it's on my site.  So when I'm looking at my google analytics, Co.lumb is coming up as a page that people are landing on.    apparently it's on my blog...   Sorry for being so vague with the question lol.  I hope I can explain it better....   I always try to keep an eye on my google analytics, and the last couple of days I've been getting traffic that landed on Co.lumb.  When I click it, it takes me to http://co.lumb.co/ .  I'm just not sure why people are landing on my blog and it's appearing as Co.lumb.     Hi guys, I've been seeing traffic land on Co.lumb on my, blog but I don't know how that's happening.  Do you guys know what that's about or how this is happening?  Thank you!   Awwww... he's the big spoon :)   Reddit!   Hi guys, the last 3 days my iphone 5 has suddenly been having problems with my home wifi.  I thought it was because I hadn't upgraded to the new iOS, but since I've upgraded it's still been the same.  Either I don't see my wifi, connect for a minute then it drops, or it's painfully slow.  I've tried to reset network settings, change my DNS to 8.8.8.8, turn off location settings, and a bunch of other online suggestions I've found.  I don't know why things have gotten so bad overnight while all the other devices in this house seems the same.  Any help would be appreciated.  Thank you :)   be my friend... lol   Tim Tams are so freaked addictinggggg!  We buy the " Arnott's " version from Cost Plus.  They are amazing when you take bites off opposite corners and suck up warm milk.  AHHH I need to go buy a bag tomorrow morning lol.   Awesome!  Thank you so much for letting me know :)  	47
    I feel like it is impossible to meet other bi women. Probably because I don't have bidar I can tell if someone is gay but bi women are tough to meet in the wild.   I actually have been working on this for the past few weeks for work. I will put it in a Google doc tomorrow and post it here. However I have only looked at 4 issues ; economy, immigration, health care, and foreign policy. But I have clips from all candidates speeches and chart to keep track of how you agree or disagree with a candidate. I teach government so that's why I did this.   The DSM v actually stipulates that the majority of suffers are of average or a bit over weight. I do think it is odd she is announcing it on the internet and she clearly has some attention seeking issues regardless.    Most people with bulimia are average weight. Because they typically eat so much food and even though they purge you can never get it all back up so they end up absorbing an average amount of calories.   Hahaha this made me laugh so hard where is this from?   If you haven't been there already there are plenty of like minded people over at r/vegan .    That is a really valid point, I think republicans would pick Jindal because they feel like he would balance out Jeb on a few things I thought Rubio might just be white noise . But I don't live in LA and I haven't looked at how the two of them are polling against each other. Rubio would be a good option .   This a thousand times I am editing videos of all the candidates for a website at work right now and every time I watch trump I cringe at how extreme he is. The far right loves him but moderates and independents won't touch him. I would bet Jeb will get the nomination and take Jindal as his running mate.   This was a thing when I was in highschool like 10 years ago.   I am doing a fellowship at a media station and I have to edit all the presidential candidates speeches , he is truly the worst candidate out there. He is so incredibly out of touch that the only thing that makes sense is that he's running to soften up the republicans so that moderates have a better chance. I just find it hard to believe that he is serious about all the crazy things be says.   I ride the metro in DC , if I am riding it home from work I just want to use that time to decompress. If I am riding it any other time I would be open to conversation and I do end up talking to tourist who are lost sometimes. But I think when you live in a big city you never really have your own space so there is kind of this understanding that you don't need to talk on the metro because it might be the closest thing you are to a lone all day.   Thanks good to know    I got rid of my Facebook when I started teaching high school for this reason . I didn't want to deal with friend request, or see something and feel obligated to say something ( like if a 16 year old was dating a 20 year old)  or have to delete all my pictures from when I was a bartender.   Congrats you look and I am sure feel fantastic! I have a logistics question for you , I would love to bike to work but I have to dress professionally, do you find you get too sweaty and have change clothes at work or could you bike in your work clothes?   I am on a mobile and don't have source but I will look a bit later , but the way it was explained to me was that cats are not a natural part of the food chain. So bird populations get killed in higher numbers that they naturally would. Causing the eco system to become unbalanced like higher bug populations and the like.    When I was younger I would let my cat out side, after she brought me 2 birds, and a lizard I decided that she could go on the screened in porch. Shortly after this I had a biology professor enlighten me about how  cats really fuck up the eco system.   Some things that really helped me were colored eyeliners instead of shadows, and rocking power brows. I put the colored liner on the outer third of my eye and blend it in towards the inner corners.  I had to come to terms with the fact that I can't really pull off some make up looks I love. So I focus on lips and brows and my skin . you have lovely eyes and there are a few make up artist on YouTube who could probably show you some tips and tricks, but that's what works for me.   I second fightmaster yoga my teacher is out of the country so I have been doing these videos at home.    I play and sing really slow and then speed it up if that makes sense.   I started playing a few months ago, and can already play a few songs . it is my first instrument and while it is challenging I am able to teach myself with the help of the internet and a couple books. I am not sure I could say the same for other instruments. I picked the ukulele because it seemed fun, I liked the sound ,and I liked the idea of traveling with it. I get what your saying that billing it as easy may discourage new players when it requires practice and patience like any other instrument, but people who do things just because they are easy typically don't make it too far in any endeavor.   Do you have a gym buddy that you can make times to meet up with. I find this is really helpful when I am lacking g structure.   Was a bartender before I was a teacher vodka soda with citrus is my go to diet cocktail. Avoid juice or mixers, as far as beer goes ultra has low calories and is pretty widely avalible   Hummus sandwich with veggies, plain yogurt with granola and fruit, canned soup with crackers, these are my go to easy lunches. I also will bring left overs from dinner the night before .   29/f/ high school social studies.  Goals this week , in order of difficulty 1 give up sweets, I have a horrible sweet tooth and I feel like since I am away from the snack machines I finally have a chance to stop. 2 give up alcohol, I don't drink a lot probably a few glasses of wine here or there but it is just empty calories so it has to go. 3 no more fast food I probably only eat this twice a month but with the extra time summer provides there is no excuse to consume this crap. 4 do something active everyday, so far this is going well in the past week I have been hiking, kayaking, swimming, walking, and done yoga I am already feeling better. It is so motivating to read everyone's goals!    That last description had me cracking up   Thanks I will give it a try!    I love the way the mountains smell in the summer. Hints of grass and floral notes, any suggestions would be great   I've tried the alternatives and they are tasty but just not the same. I kind of look at it like quitting smoking , even if I want it , it isn't good for me. Will power is an important part of being vegan   I am really happy for you that is amazing. I have been vegan for a couple years and still have cravings for non vegan foods not meat or eggs but I really miss cheese pizza and icecream. The knowledge that what I am doing is the right thing makes it easier and the cravings have definitely gotten better with time. I hope one day it becomes effortless for me. I think it is fantastic and gives me hope :) .   Thanks so much for responding I feel like that would be a great situation to have a threesome. I have a friend who might be interested now that I am thinking about it and I would feel comfortable with. Glad it was so positive for you!    That's great ! My SO and I have been talking about this but I am worried I'll get jealous. How did you handle those feelings?   Unless you want a cocktail . you get no more booze even if you say no ice so now you just have a hot rum and coke that is mostly coke.    As a high school teacher I have so much respect for elementary school teachers. I can't imagine trying to deal with 30 kindergarten kids by my self . the end of the year is a hot mess at most schools, sorry you had a tough time .   Hey I have been playing for a few months. and the past couple weeks I have been focusing on my bar chords and while some of them have gotten better many of them still sound muted. I am specifically having trouble applying equal pressure to the bar finger and the non bar fingers so I can only get one or the other to sound right. Also i feel like maybe my hand isnt flexible enough for some chords. Not sure if there are any tips for this or if it is just a keep practicing thing. Any help would be great.   Totally understand that life style and how hard it can be to get to know people if you don't really go out or want to get fucked up all the time. You may try contacting misc and seeing if they have any research positions open. I would also encourage you to talk to your advisor at school and see what ideas they might have professors tend to have a pretty good network of people to reach out to. Who knows you maybe able to get a job on campus that would get you out of the kitchen.   	36
 Thank you. I kind of agree, but I thought that made it look cool!   I thought it looked good :( maybe it's the lighting? Tasted great though!       He's ok. Not much better than his regular card. It's cool to have on your team though, especially since no one seems to be buying him.   They've been easy since 13, nearly impossible to miss this game and they weren't bad on 12 for me   Play against  the computer. Start at whatever difficulty you want. If you're comfortable that's good. If it gets to the point where you aren't losing and are easily winning, go up a difficulty. If you just getting into soccer watching more and more of it can help you play fifa.  I have a friend, he started playing it on fifa 13 and I would beat him 7-0, he now beats me most of the time, although he plays much more than I do. Watching youtubers can help too. It may sound ridiculous or nerdy, but studying how others play can make you better. Here are my tips:  1. Be patient with the ball. 2. Be patient, but not too patient on defense. 3. Get comfortable with a few skill moves.  4. Learn what's OP in the game, abuse it and learn how to stop it.  5. Develop a style of play you're comfortable with.  6. Be deadly with set pieces. (Free kicks have been OP for years now, and corners can get easy.) 7. Know the players you're using. (This might be the most important aspect. You don't want to try long shots with a guy who's long shot is 62. You don't want to head a ball in with a guy who has 50 heading accuracy. You should know weak and strong foot as well as skill moves for the players.)        Games like this make me wanna break my game, and that's why I don't have a physical copy.    Sorry I'm at work and was bored on the toilet   Gervinho-Doumbia-Ibarbo for a cheap front 3. Although Cuadrado is solid too if you prefer him to Ibarbo.  But really, I've loved the NIF Griezmann. He's great, I have him in a team with NIF Pogba and Benzema linked up with him and Griezmann has been brilliant. I also use him as a super sub in my other squads.   Reus is simply amazing and fairly cheap.   I like NIF Bolasie is you know skill moves fairly well.  Enner Valencia is an amazing striker, and he is almost always in perfect position. He's poached plenty of goals for me. He's not rated highly and he's cheap. 2 star skills though, but unless you're a skiller that shouldn't matter.   Wayne Rooney if you love long shots and strong strikers.  I've got a team with Doumbia and Teves, I think they compliment each other really well and Teves is a beast - very similar to Rooney I think.   A brilliant CM for La Liga is Perez, I forget what team he is on. Great attributes across the card.   I think the best CDM in the game is Khedira. Obviously he's slow, but he's been rock solid for me all year.   For fullbacks, I've liked Evra, Luke Shaw, Kyle Walker the most. David Alaba is or was over 10k and I found him underwhelming.   For center backs I like Benatia the most, although his high attacking work rate can be kind of annoying. I really like Rojo too.  My favorite goalkeeper in the game has been De Gea. No keeper has impressed me as much as he has or has saved me as many times.   Also, Lewandowski has been one of my favorite strikers to play up front. Great long shots, positioning, solid speed and he's strong.   Edit: Chicarito has been very fun to use as well.      We should make r/minecraftmyhouse   How do I donate?  Edit: nevermind I guess it will be in a new theead   This is what I want to do like 80% of the downtime I have with my girlfriend at night, but all she wants to do is have sex...   So close to being heaven in a picture    Good luck, but I hope I win! RemindMe! 2 Days "donate $1"   I pinch my wrist a lot and it goes away in about 30 seconds    Some people are sick and need professional help.    I agree. Ozil's skills aren't something that show up on a stat sheet or are glaringly obvious when watching highlights. But watching an entire Arsenal game, you see where and how Ozil shines.    Their strategy is always send a through ball to Neymar, run straight with Neymar and miss.          I always would've loved to see him on the squad, but we are simply too stacked at his positions.    Because he is clearly holding his own on that team and can hold his starting spot...   Public Health    Well, here's another article I'm gonna see because I want to go to NYU.    Wasn't LVG thinking about playing Januzaj in a more central attacking role, or was that a baseless rumor?    I'm so happy. He was my favorite player outside of Man U and now he's joining the club. I cannot wait to put a Man U Schweinsteiger jersey next to my Germany ones of his. Now if we can only get Reus and Boateng...    Ogtrilldanb   Thank you! My friends just organized a big tournament and I'm the 4th seed out of 8, but my first round opponent is a big pace whore and I struggle against him, but I whoop everyone below him and compete with everyone ahead of me. Thanks!   So I consider myself a solid fifa player. I'm d2 in seasons and d4 in ultimate team, but the one thing I struggle with the most is when players can just sprint right by my defense. I can't seem to stop that. I've tried being more patient on defense and playing less pressure but I can't get it to work. Any tips are appreciated! Thank you   Ogtrilldanb   Wow, thank you for your answer.  It's incredibly disturbing and sobering to remember that these things happened. Again, thanks for your answer.      Either way, I wouldn't mind having either come off the bench or as a second option!    - absolutely no weak foot - loves missing long shots - tires after one run - decent pace for that one run     And Man U is still larger globally...   Ramos doesn't give a shit about who his fans are he cares if he gets paid and if he has a chance to win a title. Let's be real. And I'm not saying whether fans from India or anywhere in Asia are more valuable than the ones in Europe or the ones that speak Spanish, I was simply saying worldwide Man U has a larger fan base.    Back in the winter transfer window I saw one.   He's not talking in terms of trophies, but in terms of popularity. Globally Man U may be more well known than Real Madrid.    Norwich, CT!   Bush did 9/11 Jet fuel can't melt steal beams Memes are the new religion    Let's be Cops   The creation of life on earth    Have fun and be safe      It's a good show. I came in skeptical because it's on syfy, but it's good.       What a universal talent   If you're gonna play it a lot then go for it. If you have friends who play the game then go for it. I just got it a week ago for $24 and it's been a good idea. All of my friends play it and I've had time to play it.   I'm new to ultimate team and I'm working on a Bundesliga team. I'm having difficulty filling out the open positions and I don't want to have to spend too much on them. Right now I have Messi on for 3 more games at striker. I have Bas dost in my squad, but is he any good?     	50
 Thanks. I try to forget it everyday but it still haunts me to this day.   Stuff has being going on and I feel like I have failed too many times. How do you rise when you're down?  	2
 Sorry if the title is slightly confusing. I'm not great with words.  I saw Ant Man and while I did think it was a good movie, I couldn't help but constantly think about what could've been if Edgar Wright was still the director.  I felt the same way watching the Steve Jobs biopic trailer. At some point David Fincher was suppose to direct with Christian Bale starring. I thought it was a perfect combination. I couldn't help but think what could've been while watching the trailer. Though I love Fassbender and Danny Boyle so I'm still holding on to hope.  Are there other films you can think of where someone was originally involved with a project from the beginning, but left early on, leaving it for someone else to continue? Did it ruin it for you because you were you thinking about what could've been? Do you wish that person had stayed or are you happy they left? Do you think it was for the better or worse?

See I don't know why people are championing for Idris Elba so hard when it will absolutely never happen. He's already 42 years old.    So why is everyone against this? He has the look. He has the acting ability    So with Daniel Craig being nearly done with the role, it'll be almost time for a new actor as Bond. Obviously we don't know what era of Bond they go with, but if they went for a younger Bond, I think Matthew Lewis would be absolutely perfect for the role. Just an idea I wanted to get out there. I would link to some photos but I'm on mobile.    She turned olive drab into totally fab!   Oh snap you're right. Totally forgot about that one!   Paul Thomas Anderson doing horror. His films are already super tense. Imagine if he was actually trying to strike fear in your heart.   Terrence Malick doing action or crime.   David Fincher doing horror as well.   Christopher Nolan doing a war movie. His scale and scope would fit this. WWII, Vietnam, Iraq, future war, etc. Any setting would work.   Again, Terrence Malick, but doing a super hero movie. His God/Nature vs man, good vs evil themes would work well in this setting.    Reverse psychology. Op secretly wants to be upvoted.    Good luck to everyone.    Wow. Just wow. You have a horrible attitude that is absolutely toxic for any creative environment.   So no one in the film business should be there if they have a love or passion for it? You don't have a love or passion for it? You're just there for the paycheck?  If you ask me, based on what I've heard, you're the one who's there for the wrong reasons. Not them.   Why even be in film if you don't have a love or passion for it?   I admire you for doing what you did, but What about people like me who cannot afford to move to a film hub? We just don't deserve to do film? You're basically saying people who are unable are undeserving. You're telling people to not even bother trying.   It may not be my career but it's my passion so screw you or anyone else that has the audacity to say I don't deserve to do it because of where I live.   Film isn't just a career, dude. It's an art and anyone anywhere can do art.    I'm 21 years old. I work hard for little pay. Barely enough to support myself. I love making films. I live in a city where the film community is very very small. I simply cannot afford to live in a city where there is a budding film community.  I don't think it's right to judge someones love and dedication to film because of where they live. That's just ignorant. Some people simply can't afford to just pack up their lives and move to a new city.   I'm a big film guy. Done a few shorts. I'd love to help out   Yes   Nope. I'm adding an edit in the post to be more descriptive. But the environment the people were in was normal.   I believe it was foreign? Everyone was humping things throughout the video.   Edit: The environment the people were in was normal.   Samsara. Basically shows a bunch of different cultures with zero dialogue so no language barrier.    Some of these really aren't bad. Especially for their time. Sure, when you compare them to today, of course they'll look bad.    I see mad max fury road in that word cloud.       So I don't read comics so the tone might be right, but I was under the impression that Suicide Squad was going to be a fun, dark comedy action movie. Sort of like a Bad Boys or Hot Fuzz. This trailer made it appear way more serious than I was expecting. Not that I'm complaining, just unexpected. Looks great!   No one has said it, but Honeymoon. Watch it. It's on Netflix. It's like 80 minutes. And it's *pure* atmosphere. Really creepy. Very mysterious. I found myself saying, "what is going on?" constantly, in a good way. I've found that the ending is what divides most people, but it's still worth a watch. Very solid, atmospheric horror. Watch it.    It reminded me a lot of Limitless in some ways even though their stories aren't that similar. I can't tell you why I kept thinking of limitless, but I did for some reason.  The biggest disappointment for me was the visuals. I'm a huge fan of Tarsem Singh because even if his movies aren't great, like Immortals, at least they are gorgeous. I realize that Self/Less isn't a visual masterpiece because it's setting doesn't lend itself to that being a for the most part realistic modern setting.   It doesn't take place in a fantasy world, or dreams, or ancient Greece. It's modern America. But that's why I see Singh films, so I was disappointed.  The film frustrated me because there are plenty glimpses of brilliance in there that they don't really do much with. This film had the potential to be a great, original sci fi flick, but everytime it starts getting interesting it turns back into a generic thriller.  The acting was unfortunately the best part for me. And I say unfortunately because I wish everything else was better. Everyone does a pretty great job in their roles though. Even the little girl I thought was fine.  My main gripe though is that it easily could've been a great film. So much wasted potential. They managed to turn a pretty great, original sci-fi idea into a generic movie, and that's the worst thing about it for me.   I also thought it was weird that Ryan was so appalled to learn that the dude donated his body to save his daughter. Like, it makes sense and is a great sacrifice.  I think it's funny that the entire film wouldn't have happened if he did what Goode said and just didn't poke around.  Also, I kind of ended up agreeing with Goode's character, Albright. He was kind of right in that most medical breakthroughs had sacrifices. Reynolds was just being a nosy ungrateful dude.     I got really excited about a short film idea and stayed up all night writing. Wrote a 17 page first draft in about 7 hours.   My two entries. I'm really looking forward to getting feedback being a new writer, as well as reading other people's entries.  http://imgur.com/a/SI71p   As someone who knows quite a few girls who are into horses, you are right.    These are easily the two best blurays out there.   The Matrix. Blew me away. It didn't just make me see film as an art, but it also made me want to be a filmmaker so now I make stuff and it's all because of that movie.   This is some top notch editing   Where the heck did you find a True Detective steel    Drive   Punch Drunk Love?   You're right, I completely forgot about Guardians of the Galaxy. And I haven't seen Winter Soldier but I hear it's great. When I say style, I mean more in how it's directed and shot, not what style of film it is. I do agree with you that they feel different, but they don't look particularly different except for GotG. I think that's because as time has gone on, Marvel studios has turned more into a factory. Directors have less and less say because of the vision Marvel has for its universe.   Aside from GotG, I think most of them are visually bland and uninteresting. I get that they have to look like they are connected but still, I can't help but not care about what I'm looking at when I see a Marvel movie now. But that's just me being a "visuals" snob. I think that's why personally I'm more excited about BvS. When Zack Snyder and Larry Fong get together, it's always interesting. Now whether it'll be a good film or not is very 50/50, but boy will it be pretty.   I just want it to be clear that I'm not faulting anyone who likes and enjoys Marvel movies. They are well made films.   Edit: It's just, like, my opinion, man.    They did something unique then proceeded to do it over and over and over and over again. Marvel, while technically good, has gone stale for me. Ant Man was the first Marvel film I was actually excited for since the first Avengers. Then Edgar Wright left and took his style with him. Obviously I haven't seen Ant Man yet, but I'm expecting another Marvel cookie cutter film.  People can argue all they want about how good or bad Batman vs Superman looks, but one thing's for sure, it oozes style. Something that has been lacking in Marvel movies lately for me.   I still say quotes from the thief to this day   I really hate this post. It's entirely pointless and pandering. You very well know this is a well loved movie here. And if you didn't, then you should've used the search function because it would've yielded many posts talking about the movie in a positive way.   This post serves one purpose: to pander. I wish the mods were better about removing post that clearly pander.    But supposedly Ving cut himself shaving and showed up with a band aid and Tarantino told him to leave it on because he liked it.    What do you mean by flat profile?   I don't really know anything about cinematography, is this suppose to help us determine the suns position so we can account for it? How does this tool help me? What do I use it for?  I'm not trying to sound ungrateful or smart, I just genuinely don't know. Thanks!     Some friends and I are wanting to make a short film. Our budget is very small and the short takes place entirely outdoors. What are some tips from yourself, articles, or videos that will guide us, and help us shoot some good looking footage outside on a shoestring budget?    Not with that grammar.    2011.  Fast Five  Thor  Bridesmaids  Pirates of the Caribbean  The Tree of Life  The Artist  Melancholia  Drive  X-Men First Class  Super 8  Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows 2  Captain America  Cowboys and Aliens  Rise of the Planet of the Apes  and last but not least, Spy Kids: All the Time in the World   Rob Schneider as older, bald Max Payne from Max Payne 3. Seriously. I think he has the capacity to be a great actor given a role that lets him act serious.    The heat index for my city will be in the high 90's-low 100's. I'm in need of some shorts, but haven't had any real luck finding some good ones.  What are some brands that are good, and which should I stay away from?  Are certain styles better than others? I know it's mostly preference, but what should I be looking for? What shorts, in your experience, have worked well for you?   Not according to The Matrix   I'd love to see more posts like this on r/movies. Bringing unknown, great movies to light and exposing them to new people.   I know he's fallen off lately, but back when Just Cause 2 came out, I thought it'd be a perfect film for Robert Rodriguez.    I agree. I'm not even sure Spec Ops is filmable.   But *so* much of RDR is influenced by, and references, other western films in terms of it's setting, style, story and characters that I'm not sure how well it'd work.   It won't be two hours. In today's day and age, TLOU would for sure get two more sequels. So, in theory, with 3 movies it could work, but the game was around 20 hours so it'd *still* feel rushed.   I don't think it was so much he already had his mind made up as much as it was him just acknowledging that it wasn't a movie geared towards him and his taste. And while I do think it's important to review a movie based on what it is and not what you want it to be, I do think there is something to be said for reviewing a movie based off of who you are. Makes it a little easier to judge if you'd like a movie or not. For example, if I find I agree and generally have the same views as a certain reviewer, then it helps me determine if I'd like a movie or not.  It should also be said that Filmdrunk is a personality driven site by comedians. They aren't interested in objectively talking about movies. They enjoy speaking subjectively about them. They know they aren't, and never claim, to be the best, or most informative reviewers.   Yes they can be very cynical, but that's just their personalities. And it should be said that they all have very different personalities and opinions. This is just one dude.    And it's not just visually beautiful, it's also thematically beautiful.    I'm a nice guy   And that's it. I can't remember the name but I'd like to find it   Is none going to talk about how hilariously ridiculous Vincent D'Onofrio's plan for a raptor army was? Still a way better movie than I was expecting though.    In my experience, I kind of have to. I don't know and can't afford an editor *and* a cinematographer *and* a director *and* a writer etc.   Sometimes you just have to do it all yourself. It's more stressful and harder, but you do what you gotta do. It's worked out alright for me in the past.   When your just starting out, unless you have a lot of money, people, professionals, usually won't work for free. Now if you have previous work that is good, some might because it shows potential. But a lot of the times, at least for me, the only way to start a portfolio is to do some shorts where you're doing everything.   However, it also depends on the scope of the project as well as your budget.    Willravel 2015   I remember when Gravity first came out and anyone who said anything negative about it was downvoted because everyone thought it was the second coming or something.   I'm with you. What happened in Up is just life. It's natural. Now if she died young that'd be terrible, but it seems like besides the failed pregnancy, they lived a rather happy life. They were able to grow old together.   Now Interstellar, he couldn't be there. The realization that twenty something years had just gone by was soul shattering. Him watching his kids grow old without him, knowing he missed it all. That's not natural. That's hell for a parent.       Blood is pretty dark irl though.  As someone who has studied forensics in school, it is not. When you have a lot of blood condensed in a small area, it's dark. But blood, like you would get from a spray from a gunshot is very red. Even pooled blood is red. The deeper the blood, the darker it gets obviously, but blood from a typical gunshot or stab wound is red. The blood isn't thick/deep enough for it to appear dark.  But it doesn't take any sort of specialist to know this. Look at any pictures of crime scenes or surgeries and you'll see. Fresh blood is red.   I think short term 12 is a really good well made film. But the thing is, it's nothing groundbreaking. It's just a really good drama. I honestly don't understand why it gets so highly praised.   So I think this movie was very good, however I think I ruined it for myself. I was going into it with the expectation of crying my eyes out and having this huge emotional ride. I never got to that point. I kind of felt this movie just fizzled out. The climax wasn't that high for me. I dunno. Like I said, this movie is still very very good and the acting is great.   I really really love romance movies like The Proposal. Movies where someone asks someone else to pretend to be their spouse or significant other in order to fool some person(s). However, in the process of pretending, they, of course, actually do fall in love.   Are there more movies like this? I'm sure there has to be, right?   Legend's wife seems *super* drunk   The writing wasn't terrible, the acting was good, the cinematography was good, and the directing was fine. In fact, it's no secret that a lot was cut for theatrical release.   It's an average film, and if it wasn't a remake, people would be okay with it. I've seen both. I strongly believe that if people have the ability to see both, they should choose the original. Just like everyone else. However, if you only had the option to see the Lee one, for whatever reason, it's not bad.   It's subpar to the original, but for the most part tells the same story without much change. That's why it's not a bad remake. Just unnecessary. As a film though, from a technical standpoint, it's not bad.    No it's not. Is it unnecessary? Yes. Is it bad? Not at all.    So my day started at, like, 3 am? I went to bed early then woke up waaay earlier than I wanted to. Oh well, took advantage of the time and finished up Bloodline! That show's pretty great. Got very suspenseful towards the end. Finale left me with mixed feelings. Still, great overall.  Had breakfast at around, I dunno, 6 maybe? More eggwhites. This time with spinach and chicken. Get dat protein. Then a tangerine. Started working on my film resume. Took a nap then went to work.  Work suuuuuuccckkks. Super slow. Strange customers. Ugh, I hate people. Waling around. Moving things. Not buying stuff. This lady was there walking around till after close and I'm just like "gtfo"  Had chicken and veggies for dinner. Should've seasoned the veggies...  Watched Wayward Pines. I have no idea what's going on in this show.  My mom and sister's birthday is tomorrow. They have the same birthday. *Still* haven't gotten a card. I'm a bad brother/son!  Think I might clean tomorrow. *Maybe*.  Really hyped about Mad Max this weekend! I'm seeing it with Zach and Kevin, my besties. It's gonna be sick!  Maybe I'll watch movies all day tomorrow.   Finally finished my film resume. Put that off waaaay too long. Now I just have to send it in and cross my fingers.  Man, if I get this job I can finally say I do film for a living. How cool is that? Goodbye retail, hello film production!  Knock on wood!   I've never applied for a position in film before. I finished my resume and demo reel. The company asked for them to be sent together. They gave an email to send it to, but no other info.  Do I send the resume as a PDF? On google drive? Dropbox?  Do I just include the link for the reel?  I realize this might vary from company to company, but since they gave no info, is there a standard way to do it?   So I guess this is the first "official" diary entry.  I'm assuming someone came in and downvoted everyone. Not just me, but the commenters. Not the environment I want to have, so I did something to prevent it in the future.  No more downvote arrow! Welcome to 1942 France!  No, but seriously it's not a diva thing of "how dare someone downvote me!" No, it's more about creating a non hostile environment.   I started my diet and exercise this morning officially. Just a two week diet though. My cousin is getting married in two weeks and I wanna look decent in a suit.   Diet is working so far. Had eggwhites this morning. I've been snacking on oranges and occasionally, tuna, throughout the day. I also went on a 3 mile walk. Already lost 2 pounds! It's nice to see results so soon.  Then I took a looooong nap. Felt great!  I wanted to get back down to 200lbs by August. I was 200lbs my senior year of high school, my peak physical fitness. Got 30lbs to go. Seems doable by August. I'm still kicking myself for not joining that gym back in January like I said I would. I am an artist and procrastination is my medium.  Other than that, not much has happened today.  Been talking to this girl. Real nice! We'll see how far this goes.  It's 9:48pm at the time of me writing this. Chicago PD is on in the background. That dudes voice is hilarious! I might spend the rest of my night watching the rest of Bloodline. I'm halfway through and I wanna finish before I forget what happens.  I dunno. Might play some Call of Duty? Oh yeah, I'm having PS4 problems. Forgot. Oh well. Maybe I'll play Rock Band 3?  Whatever, I'll figure something out.  ATZ        lol   So in the mean time while I figure out whether to let people post in this sub and what those posts should be, as well as the general nature of this sub, I thought it'd be a *hopefully* good idea to have a place where people could ask questions and make comments. Maybe you have an idea on how to make this strange subreddit work or maybe you just want to ask whatever. Either way, feel free to post it here.     I'm trying to figure out the best way to run this place. You know, a way where things are organized.  Thinking about how to title stuff. Should I include a date in the title? I feel like that'd be redundant considering reddit will quasi-date things for me. Maybe I should just number stuff, like "Entry 1", "Entry 2" and so on.  Maybe I'll just abandon all attempts of organization and just post things how they happen.  What if I categorize the posts? That might work. Such as "Diary Entry", "Picture", etc. But then that means I have to come up with headings, which also means I need to put some forethought into this. *Maybe*.  Who knows? Eventually things will just organize themselves, right? That's how I made it through high school.  ATZ   This place is a diary of sorts. I'm test_subject6208, and though my life isn't interesting enough to warrant my own subreddit, I'm still doing it.  Why? I figured it'd be an outlet to talk about things anonymously, for the most part, while improving my writing skills at the same time.  I thought instead of just creating a massive post about who I am, I would just let things reveal themselves over time. Who I am as a person, my hobbies, likes, dislikes, my life, etc., will be revealed over time. I'll post "diary" entries that will be in the form of a text post, picture, or both. These entries will be about my days, thoughts, or whatever.  I've never been good at keeping a journal. Hopefully I'll be diligent with this. If Reddit stays around for a while, it might be an interesting, yet unconventional biography of sorts for whoever takes an interest in it.  ATZ  Edit: It should be said that my style of writing is more like free writing, but less organized. Entries will most likely be written as I say it in my head with little thought of what makes sense, if that makes sense?  Note: I tend to be sarcastic and hyperbolic when I write. I'm trying to lessen it, but it's a habit. Can you have writing habits? Either way, just keep it in mind.       Man that part when they're in the kitchen and she's just like "I don't love you anymore" and Gosling just starts crying. That ending is so rough. Beautiful film.    I'm an aspiring filmmaker, and it'd be awesome to mess around with it and make short films.   I asked Rockstar but never got an answer.  Would director mode even work on consoles?   It's okay. *I* got your reference.    Yep, I think Pattinson stole the show in this one   So could they not just chop off the Silent Hills trailer at the end and re release it?   Going to a wedding in a few weeks. What are some good, trendy places around here that aren't very expensive?   Interesting, I actually find Cinema Sins more clever than Honest Trailers.  I also find it interesting that Red Letter Media gets so much love in /r/movies. They are very cynical about movies and are often harsh and, at least on Half in the Bag(their review show), appear to not really keep up with movies and not care about most modern big budget movies, which /r/movies loves. I love RLM though.   To make a long story short, I'm an aspiring filmmaker. Been working for years shooting various things. Never for profit. Finally, my work paid off. Met with someone that wrote a book that was being made into a film. Nothing big, they had a small budget. I was asked to help write then later, asked to direct. Things were coming together, we were just about to start writing. I then get news that they decided to hire professional writers and get a different director. I'm probably not involved anymore.  I'm not giving up filmmaking, but this was such a blow to the gut. Would love to eat this pain away.  Edit: TN, USA   Bad Boys II   Wow, I had no idea and have not seen it before so I will definitely check it out, thank you!   Wow, that's a lot of candles, but it looks great, thank you!   Most definitely   Stoic isn't *that* bad   After looking through screenshots of various films it made me curious of the lighting set up of those scenes such as what were they using and where were they placed. Any places online that go into this?   I'm trying to find examples of films that were shot exclusively using practical lighting. However, google isn't yielding results. Do you know of any that were entirely or almost entirely practical lighting?   I'm co-adapting a book into a screenplay. The book, however is primarily narration with vey little dialogue. I'm struggling with coming up with ways of telling this story without it lacking any dialogue.   The book features many characters interacting, but rarely with any dialogue. They *do* talk, but in the book, there's no dialogue for the conversation the characters are having.  The author expressed interest in the film being primarily narration, but I'm not sure how to do this without it being tedious, boring, or overdone.  Not really sure what to do. Any advice or examples of films that pull this off would be very helpful. Thank you guys in advance.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop persist_app=1 v=Ha4j7iapEUM   Saw the title and misread it as a movie called Seven Soviet and thought it was a Russian retelling of Seven Samurai.    Ride with me.    Only took me, like, 15 minutes    This can be caused by the marketing, word of mouth, etc  I'm not necessarily saying they were intentionally misleading, but more so they appeared to be one kind of movie, but after seeing, turns out to be something else.   My example is the film Martyrs. It's marketed as a horror and while it technically is horror, after seeing it it feels more like an emotional drama  Also The Babadook. For those who haven't seen it, it appears to be a horror film but after viewing, feels like a psychological family drama.   Are there other films like this that aren't as they appear on surface level   The Wrestler   Yeah the same thing happens to me. Also, I followed an npc on foot and he just walked around the block continuously.   Absolutely watch New World!   To me it's because the tattoos make it look like he's *trying* to look crazy and unstable, whereas without them he just seems naturally crazy and unstable.   I have a somewhat general question. love editing, especially trailers. How does one get into it professionally?   [Neat](http://imgur.com/r/futurama/GGVHcO9)   /r/RussiaOrWestVirginia   Was it really only 3 years? Feels way longer   Or just have it be the after credits scene.    I know this isn't the type of thing that you would normally turn into a post, and I wouldn't be surprised if only a few people saw it, but I had to get it out because it's too perfect.   What if Showgirls wasn't made when it was and instead was made today. And what if it wasn't directed by Paul Verhoven(?)? Who would be the best director for the Showgirls of the 2010s?   Nicholas Winding Refn.   I know Refn is a name that sometimes gets jerked around here, but bear with me. The story I think would fit his style. This strange crime-esque story with not so normal characters. Not to mention how well the Vegas Strip would work with his visual style.   I'm just saying a Refn directed Showgirls could be awesome.   So I guess the discussion part would be, if Refn directed Showgirls, would it be good? Or is showgirls so bad no director could save it?      No Country for Old Men    Thank you! I totally realized it was long but I wasn't sure what to keep and what to throw out. I knew not too long after starting that I didn't have a whole lot of work. Unfortunately, the place I'm applying at asked for a resume *and* a reel. Because the local production company is relatively small, the job is basically a general all around job, looking for people with experience in editing, producing, writing, and directing, which I *do* have experience in, but I wasn't sure how the reel was supposed to show all of these things.      I made a reel for a job for a local production company. I've never made a reel before. I put [this](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0By3l0nVnUv1hb2dlUE82WUppZlU/view?usp=sharing) one together, however it needs some serious work and should be way shorter.  What shots should I take out? What shots should be shorter? How can I improve this reel?   I really dig the [score](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hT1eNQWO9tY list=PLQCXD9Nsb1yZqmThf9wvxx5kTkd_RdKO8 index=14) for Birdman. This cool, jazzy, improv sounding percussions sound. What else will I like that is this style?   Was really hoping we'd see a Jaa vs The Rock fight   Title   I'm applying for a job and have never made a reel before.  1. What should be in the reel?  2. How long should it be?  3. Where do I upload it to?  4. Are there any good online guides to making a good reel?  5. Should my reel have a coherent flow that connects the shots?  Edit: I'm applying for a general writer/director/producer position at a small local production company.       I believe.    Glad to hear Spy is pretty good   I give it massive points for being something new and original. Every time I thought I knew where it was going, it went somewhere else.   That said, I think the ending felt really rushed. It's wired, throughout most of the movie I felt like these two people really loved each other, but by the end it felt rushed and I didn't really feel that way about the characters anymore. I understand that the movie couldn't be longer but I wish it was. It's a pretty dense movie. There's a lot you don't understand throughout most of it, then when it reveals things it feels like an information overload. Not that that's a bad thing, but I wish it took its time to explain things.   I really really loved the first 3 quarters but feel very lukewarm about the 4th quarter. And because of it, I came away with an overall lukewarm impression of the film.   Like I said, it's great that it took a risk at being something unique, and honestly, it *is* unique. I just wish I liked it more.    I'm getting a haircut and I really like the look of Trent Reznor's hair. I'm having trouble figuring out how long it is though due to how dark his hair is. Anyone got an idea of how long the top and sides are?  Album: https://imgur.com/a/52eFz      With Keanu getting older, I could see Josh playing Spike if Cowboy Bebop ever moves forward.    There are few things worse than when a movie has a good villain, but they give them an unsatisfying ending, what examples do you have?  Spoilers obviously   Because it's not really scary. More creepy than anything. It really doesn't hold up well.    I find it super interesting that Only God Forgives was too much for you and Valhalla Rising is your favorite.    Any particular ones you recommend? I went to EZ Pawn and the selection was super lackluster. Pretty much just TVs and power tools and a few instruments.   So I have two unrelated questions and instead of making two posts, I thought I'd consolidate.  Q1) What are some places that would have some good variety of men's hair products for sale?   Q2) What are some pawn shops that usually have some good things and aren't *super* sketchy?    Meeska mooska   I don't like love ballads for some reason.      What song and what artist?   But with the callouses you would build from not wearing shoes, you wouldn't even need any shoes! Built in shoes rule!      You and me both.    Yes and no. According to the contest, if you were a rich dude, yeah you could pay a large sum to go to the premiere, but you aren't guaranteed to *win* and hang with RDJ. It's still chance and you'd only be increasing your chance to win. I mean, if I payed $50,000 and got 500,000 entries, there's still the chance, however small, I'll still lose and not meet RDJ.  Bad example, but at my middle school dance, there was a raffle for an Xbox and you payed $1 for 1 raffle ticket and could buy as many as you want. People were paying upwards to $50 or more. But the dude who won it only bought 1 ticket.  Miracles happen, man!   So in /r/animalsbeingjerks, they have a way to filter all of the posts if you wanted to see just cat posts or dog posts or bird posts etc. I don't know what the labels would be, but I think that could work here.    Yea I went to Blu-Ray.com and it has nothing on this one. Really hoping it's good    Cool!   Finally! Can't wait to get Equilibrium on bluray!   Also, the pacing of the movie is impeccable! It never drags   I love everything David Fincher has done, but for me, it'd have to be The Social Network. I just feel like this was the movie where David Fincer really took every technique he had learned and combined them together. Everything in that film came together perfectly. And you can feel so much of TSN's influence in his later work such as Girl With the Dragon Tattoo, Gone Girl, and even House of Cards. I always thought David Fincher was a great director, but The Social Network really elevated him a whole new level. Yes Seven, Fight Club, and Zodiac are great, but I feel TSN was the movie where *everything* just perfectly came together. No single part felt subpar compared to the other parts. The Social Network is just a much more efficient machine than anything he's done before and since The Social Network. But again, I love everything Fincher has done.    This is such a great movie that no one ever talks about   If this isn't /r/Retiredgif material, I don't know what is.    They were just like "Your wife is on the phone" and space ghost said" tell her I'm dead"   It was a super funny clip and I cannot find it anywhere. I don't think it was the one with Bjork?   I thought this was really bad. Whatever they were trying to achieve, I felt they missed the mark by a lot.   It may be parody or satire, but despite the creator's intentions, it honestly looks more like a failed attempt to make an "adult" Power Rangers than an attempt to satire "gritty" action movies.   Exactly, people are like, "I can't believe no one realizes this is a joke!" but the thing is, despite the fact that it's supposed to be a joke/parody/satire, it's a really bad short. Mediocre at best. The reason some people don't see it as parody or satire is because it does such a horrendous job of portraying that.  Despite the creator's intentions, it honestly looks more like a failed attempt to make an "adult" Power Rangers than an attempt to satire "gritty" action movies.   Is there a lyric that really stands out to you as great in a, for the most part, mediocre/bad song?   I was thinking about this while listening to the radio on my way home.  Is there a lyric that really stands out to you as great in a, for the most part, mediocre/bad song?   I still honestly believe that the difference between 24 and 30 is not that noticeable. Yes 30 is smoother than 24, but not by that much. It's all just opinion.   I don't think there is a noticeable difference between 24 and 30. I've shot short films in 24, 30, and 60 and I think 30 is close enough to 24 to where it isn't a big enough difference to matter.   And I don't think it's just the frame rate that makes it more filmic. Like you said, aspect ratio, color grading, and cinematography are involved. Which The Order, I think, has some really filmic cinematography going on with its lighting. Some of the shots look straight out of a film. The aspect ratio also helps in this. I think The Order is an example of "What if we made a film into a game."  I'm not trying to defend this games short comings. I too think that the game is overpriced and probably won't be good. But I think out of all the weird decisions they've made, the 30 fps thing is the most believable and makes the most sense, even if they are just covering up a problem.   I'm not saying that it's right for them to make it 30. I think it's very important for games to be 60 because every frame counts and can be the difference between success and failure. But if they are going for a more filmic and cinematic look, which it looks like they are, then 30 makes *some* sense. Or at least a little informed.    I'm just saying that with 60fps things are super smooth. But with 30 it just looks more filmic. So it does make some sense to me at least.    To be fair, there *is* a more "cinematic look" with 30fps vs 60fps. Not saying it's smart or the right thing to do, but I think they're being honest about that at least.   	156
 Hahaha, nah, its just a massive pork meatball that melts in the mouth. I've never been a steak kinda gal but I imagine this is what it'd be like.   Its only called Lionshead due to the sheer size- about the size of your hands fisted together      **Rave**: OST C20- why did it take me so long to pull the plug with L-AA's? I have seen such visible results in the past week I have been using it and its worked so much better than my 50 bottle of Kiehl's Dark Spot corrector and SAP Vit C  **Rant**- What on earth is this huge cystic thing in between my brows?! I have never experienced any pimple being so painful and full of gunk.   Yeah, I have started spreading it down but the BHA and AHA just adds to the overall stickiness then I have like 3 ampoules....(Its summer and I'm talking full advantage of the late mornings I have :D)  I have got a bit of Mario Badescu's Glycolic Acid toner that contains so little AHA I'll probably use that to finish it off.   Oh my goodness, [that moment] (http://i58.photobucket.com/albums/g246/sey115/sey115027/ya%20lil%20nasty_zpssjmzu0qs.gif) when it drips into your mouth and you taste it...   I have recently started using C20 before my BHA and AHA but because I've been very liberal with the amount of C20 I use (about a whole dropper to prevent wasting the product), it leaves my face very sticky. Should I rinse it off after the 20 min window before continuing with my acids?   Yeah! Sometimes I have to lie down or wring out some of the essence if I want to sit up. Unfortunately, I don't have access to Daiso here in the UK :(   I generally leave mine on for about 30 mins, although if its still wet I'll keep it on for longer. Some MBD ones are soaking wet and so I'll leave them on for longer.   RRS pretty much always marks it as $20   Paid on time and great communication.   $paid /u/brd989 75GBP   Same for me!! I don't have very oily eyelids but this still still smudges onto my lower lash line. I think I'm going to have to try a Majolica Majorca one or the Holika Holika Pole Mascara   Thank you for all your hard work, we shall all miss you lots!    I actually saw this on VHS but I know you can definitely find it online in awful quality   **Chunking Express** (1994)- I'm making my way through Asian films this summer and started with Wong Kar Wai. I loved Takeshi Kaneshiro in this and how his character thinks himself as a man but really is just a boy.   I love this film so much, Joaquin Pheonix really blew me away   Whisper slowly in their ear 'put it awayyyyyyy'   Seconding the Play 101 and Clio Gelpresso part, but I would recommend the Clio over the EH. The play 101 just *will not* stay on my upper waterline    Haha, no problem!! Show me once you're done ;)  Ooooh, also I would suggest you freehand the second coat. I left the tape on for the 2nd coat (when I took those photos) and when peeling it off, I couldn't get a sharp line :(   Yep, thats me too. I also go through phases of when my lips crack and nothing works so I have to buy more to use and more to put in different bags.   $loan 60 GBP   Thank you! It's Sally Hansen Xtreme Wear in 20, Brick Red. First coat looks hot pink but with the second, its a true garnet/deep red   I stuck of 3M medical tape down but would recommend masking tape over any other tape, although the 3M one works better than Sellotape.  1. Base coat and a sheer pink to neutralise the 'half-moon' of my nail beds. I would advise against doing this as some of it later stuck to the tape and you'd have to clean this off before sealing with a top coat. I think a base coat will be fine, as the top colour covers most of the half-moon part of your nail (I don't know the technical term, sorry!)  2. Stuck a small piece of tape (about 4mm x 3mm but about 6x5mm for my thumb) down diagonally onto the nail. Make sure to press the tape into the finger to prevent any polish from bleeding.  3. Paint 2 coats of colour over it- I only used 2 bits of tape so peeled them off to do my other 2 fingers and freehanded the 2nd coat. Obviously this isn't necessary if you're using 10 bits of tape which I would advise if you want to cut down time.  Honestly, I'm getting into nail art but I hate waiting for my nails to dry and I'm lazy... so minimal designs are super appealing to me.  EDIT: I painted some nails again and [here] (http://i.imgur.com/wz9aR5a.jpg) is how much tape I used and how I laid it down  	23

       Where can I find orange teslas   same where the fuck can i get those?   these are the fucking bomb! What do you guys pay for them? I think my dealer is over charging me.   True, well I mean we already see people shooting up schools because they want to be famous and that seems to be the easiest way in an overpopulated super competitive society.     That's when we get a zombie apocalypse!         evaluate function   need a ride to west campus at ut in austin will pay gas      cancer looks like urgot skin from league of legends   yeah we will go with that. I wish it had the samsung logo   Hi, I was just wondering where I can buy these fake samsung phones and also the fake apple iphones. I was wanting to get either a fake s5 or iphone 6.      Hi, just wanted to know if you can use the fake galaxies on a network since it mentions they are unlocked. I was thinking of buying one and using it with straight talk.   Wow ok I feel like we have both been clinging on hard to this relationship and trying to put off the issues but I guess it is time to face them. Thank you for your talking to a sometimes an asshole/ nice guy.   I asked and the response to that was no because she has to work. She works two jobs and I am trying my hardest to believe that she does not have time for us to hang out at all but it is honestly hard to believe. It has driven me to the point of almost cheating on her this past weekend because she is making it seem like we have nothing but yet won't end it.   Ugh that's the problem we both work a lot this summer, her more so than I so we have basically been at a standstill. I have asked her to take a couple of days off so we could maybe go vacation but she told me "I like work" I don't understand, if she's upset at me and does not think that we will ever make it then why does she not just break up with me.   Why has she put up with me for this long then? Do you think she is trying her hardest to forgive me and my romantic efforts are making her forget slowly but surely? Or does she just want to hurt me back first?  	21
 Your posts are not wasting time but probably are your current job.  Have a good night Clinton operative.   I think you know why I think you are on reddit. You are good at what you do.   I think you know the answer to this question. So you think me doubting Hillary Clinton's non-answer answer on the TPP makes  me a conspiracy nut.    Or you could make up a better reason for not posting links. Most people who like reddit post links and comments. I do not buy your reason for not posting links.   I rarely find this is the case when I post a link.   Vulcanfactcheck I have a question for you. Why do you post only comments on politics and never post links?     The Clintons have always been for corporate free trade deals.    The reason as stated in her official position and what is her real reason is often two different things. Your use of language makes me think you are a lawyer.   We all know Clinton is for the TPP.   He is the flying spaghetti monster's gift to the Democrats.   The article highlights how Bernie Sanders believes he is different on trade than Hillary Clinton.   The article is about trade and the TPP and is less than 45 days old.  We all know where Hillary Clinton stands on the TPP. She is for it.   The TPP is a current event.         I just signed the petition.    Probably not much.   She is a kid not a professional.   I think you know the answer.    Guitar not guiter.    Yea my spelling is not always the best.

Still cool in my book.    I can't keep a tune and from my misspelling of guitar in title it seems I can't spell either.    You get the point. Enjoy the video.   Should have put this meme in the /r/conspiracy.   Good music may have a future.   Thank you for link. Going to check it out. Today was the first time I watched some of her videos.

Go away buddy.       Reddit needs to make it's website a "safe place" for corporate advertisers. The bean counters don't understand that if this change takes place they will lose most of their users.    Most private institutions are funded by corporate donations.

 The video appears to be edited around the 30:00 mark when the officer is telling his version of events. What's up with that?      Omg, I interviewed with these guys too! I don't think it's a pyramid scheme necessarily, but it is shady. The person I spent a day with actually laid out the strategy, but I forgot the parent company name.      Israel has repeatedly stated that they hold Hamas, as the purported governing body of Gaza, responsible for all attacks that originate from the territory. As you can see from the year after the war (September through May, at least) you can see that Hamas can indeed control when rockets are being fired or not, even if they are not directly participating.  The point is that there was an effective 19-month ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, which Israel broke, leading to a war in which 67 Israelis died.  Unless of course you hold the easily defensible position that the kidnapping of the three teens by Hamas operatives was in itself an attack by Hamas, thus breaking the ceasefire themselves.  Or the previous opinion, that since Hamas controls the Gaza Strip, every rocket fired is in itself a violation of the ceasefire, whether Hamas does it themselves or not.   [Especially when the text of the ceasefire in 2012 states plainly that rockets attacks from **all Palestinian factions**, will cease.](http://www.jpost.com/Defense/Text-of-Israel-Hamas-cease-fire-agreement)     I think you meant 2014, not 2012, since that's when the article was written. And though Hamas might not have directly fired rockets during the prior 19 months, rockets from Gaza were a constant threat throughout 2014.   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Palestinian_rocket_attacks_on_Israel,_2014   Recorded in Kings 2 6 and Lamentations.     No, it indicates large-scale oppression. Anti-semetism being merely present won't fill you with constant suspense, dread, and fear of being murdered. Jews don't have those concerns in most places today.  Today, maybe. But in the past 2000 years this has been true in many, many situations.   Just so you know, he's wrong about the date. According to scholars, the Torah was written (compiled) in the 5th century B.C.E. in the time of Ezra, during the return to Israel after the first exile. Yes, the Roman exile was actually the second! This is how the deutoronomic prophecies are explained -- they are said to be written after they have occurred, when Babylon/Assyria invaded and exiled Judah/Israel. Still doesn't explain how accurate they have been for the entirety of the second (Roman) exile.  Also, the key phrase you are arguing "a language you will not understand" can be translated in several different ways, one of which is "a language you will not have understood" due to how tenses work in the Torah. It's complicated.  Random side fact: This entire section is called the Tochacha, or rebuke, and is read very quietly in synagogue when it comes up in the yearly cycle.   Old Testament = Tanach, of which the Torah is only a part  Tanach is the acronym of Torah, Nevi'im, Ketubim; Teaching, Prophets, Writings.   yes, no, no, yes  I try, though I've lapsed recently. Maybe this will be the motivation to get better! :)   The mini (or "new") Ice Age was widely espoused in the 1970s.  [No it was not.](http://www.dailykos.com/story/2015/06/22/1393196/-The-truth-about-ice-ages-and-the-anatomy-of-a-zombie-lie)   Yes, they're bullshitting.   My spreadsheet is just a compilation of mods, none of them are mine. You're using one of the four I recommended above (#178) which does seem like the best presented one. But like I said before, I haven't used any of them myself yet.   They're in the URL. So 17 is http://www.nexusmods.com/witcher3/mods/17/   Change the number to 40 and you get http://www.nexusmods.com/witcher3/mods/40/   Alternatively, go to [my spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zStz8eChga1xHsntz2qKyBgK_BCy9_S-Pvnx4DfKRYk/edit#gid=0) and scroll down to leveling.   ...This is a blog, not professional journalism.   No to both   Look at mod numbers 17, 40, 178 and 186. Those are all the mods that can potentially slow down XP gain, but I haven't tried them.   Have you read the modding tutorial yet?   http://www.nexusmods.com/witcher3/mods/14/   And how do you distinguish the two categories?   That means she should be getting subsidies. Unless she's in one of the Republican states that didn't expand medicare, leaving the gap of people who can't get affordable coverage?   Shouldn't she qualify for Medicaid?   They were partially mobilized in the months prior, but the economy was taking too much of a hit to keep them.   That's not even halfway! It's where the game really begins.   [Relevant Onion article](http://www.theonion.com/article/girlfriend-changes-man-into-someone-shes-not-inter-1507)   Most left after 1948   Even better, there's now a mod to activate the photo mode with just one button!  http://www.nexusmods.com/witcher3/mods/190/?   many...Jewish people  Not anymore :(   Can you say more about the mutinies? I've never heard of these before.   Is that the best of the 10+ Gamepad mods, do you think?   Check out [my mod list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zStz8eChga1xHsntz2qKyBgK_BCy9_S-Pvnx4DfKRYk/edit#gid=0)! There are three mods to slow down leveling, if it's going to fast for you. I also recommend the console mod and the saddlebags mod if you need more storage space.   Not if you want to carry around all the Witcher swords and armor.    At that time the festival of the Dedication took place in Jerusalem  TIL Hannukah is mentioned in the NT.   To correct your arrogant post, I've had a flag in the back of my car before and I'm definitely not a racist. It's the mindset of ignorant people like you who are making this a race issue. Sure, some people who fly it are racist. There are plenty who don't fly it that are racist as well. I'm from ~~Virginia~~ Germany, and around here it is the ~~rednecks~~ hillbillies that primarily fly it, but there are also historians that will fly it, as well as other prominent figures. ~~Down south~~ In this country, it's heritage. I didn't have any family members partake in ~~the Civil War~~ WWII, but there is a large battlefield in my town. It's history. It's becoming a case of "Don't tell the true history because it'll offend people". Yes, there was ~~slavery~~ mass murder and racism associated with the flag. Yes, the ~~south~~ Third Reich was harsh to them AT POINTS (not every ~~southerner~~ German hated ~~people of color~~ Jews and other "undesirables."). But it's history. It's the people who want to make it out to be a race war that will make it so.   Doesn't look so good now, does it?   Then you acknowledge that you're incorrect, not pass it off like it fits with your claim despite the contradiction. Saying "I was wrong" might be hard, but otherwise you're not debating honestly.   Oh, I've played. But I didn't finish because my shitty laptop couldn't run it.   What kind of problems?   Are there any disadvantages aside from having steam open?   I currently have morrowind on a disc, gotten as a gift over 10 years ago. I had to download cracked versions of the DLC to be able to play the game with mods.   Now I see that Morrowind is $5 on steam. Is it worth it to buy? How easy are mods to install?   If he did everything else and began building the Temple, but it wasn't completed, then maybe. Otherwise, no.      Of course the Old Testament doesn't have an ending, it's not supposed to. The ending is how we live our lives.       To be fair, a lot of them in Beitar Illit are Hareidim.    Yes, the writeup is bad. And?   Just because the pronunciation of Modern Hebrew is influenced by Arabic and English doesn't mean the languages aren't extremely similar. Speaking might be difficult, but reading accurately can be compared with modern and shakeperean English.    Gabriel means "Might of God," Rahael means "Healing of God" Elijah means "the LORD is God." We could go on all day.   Mizrahim (correct me if I'm wrong) spoke primarily Judeo-Arabic.   Arabic, Judeo-Arabic, and Aramaic were the languages spoken in the Arab world.  This isn't accurate.  He is right, you're right. Modern Hebrew is close enough to Biblical Hebrew that it can be compared to modern English and Shakespearean English. Yes, you might have trouble with it, but they are extremely similar.   However, the inscription found is not Biblical Hebrew script, but one older than that. It does use much of the same grammar though.   Oh, I agree with you. It was just a tip to make the game a little less annoying. I also use the drag and drop trick.   I chose to spare him and never got that mutagen :(   For the humans just always have hanged man's oil applied. Now you only have 1/3 at a disadvantage, and you're always prepared for people jumping you. It's the only thing you can put on the steel sword anyway.   The crafting mutagen part was fixed already. The reassigning them to get their base enhancement was not.   I've actually found ones which I can craft, weirdly enough. But they are the minority.    Good analysis. Just two points which can be contended:    The off-screen death: Brienne, who appeared for 8 seconds in the whole season, appears Deus Ex Machina to kill Stannis in the last minute. No explanation. No build-up. No stakes. How did the writers foreshadow this? By openly having Brienne telling the audience she was going to do so during those 8 seconds.   She actually had a scene earlier in the season about wanting to kill stannins, and how it conflicts with her duty to find Catelyn's children. Then the scene earlier in the episode where she is torn between watching the tower and finding Stannis actually starts the drama.  Myrcella declaring her love to his father just to die in his arms --with no reason to have that knowledge-- serves only shock;  eh, you can argue she learned it in dorne, coming off the whole disscusion of nobody in dorne caring.  But yes the episode felt rushed. In fact, it felt like I was waiting for the actual finale after this ended.    We know Jon is murdered. The issue is whether or not he comes back.   They find the nest, then see the wake, then find the ring.    Brienne of Arc!   Does this include any of the DLC?   That's not how it works at all.  His mother is Jewish so he's Jewish. He will always be Jewish but if he marries a non-Jew his children will not be.  The other woman actually has a point in Reform Judaism. They say if the child isn't raised Jewish, then they don't as Jewish if only one parent is. That shit gets complicated.    It's oglaf. That's the only answer you need.   I did the werewolf quest after yen left, it was fine.   The Conservative prayer book edited the original prayers slightly to make it ambiguous.    Hey at least we don't have anyone like that as the darling of left wing news networks or actual elected representatives.   It's a list of all mods on Nexus. I don't think I've seen anything gamebreaking yet, but as always with mods, use at your own risk! I edited the OP to make this clear.   Lol, most of these are probably conflicting, especially the graphics ones. I'm just keeping the list so people know what the options are.   Go do the main quests. Killing things gives you very little XP, and doing over-leveled quests/killing over-leveled monsters doesn't give you any extra.   I've made and been maintaining a mod list of all the mods on Nexus so myself and other people can keep track of them and choose the best ones. I've been keeping it up to date as much as I can. It doesn't have a lot of information about each mod yet, but it does include the link, title, Nexus # and author for each one, separated into categories. I hope this helps you!   Remember:  Use mods at your own risk! This is a categorized list of of mods, not a recommendation.  https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zStz8eChga1xHsntz2qKyBgK_BCy9_S-Pvnx4DfKRYk/edit#gid=0  If you like it, upvote this post so other people can see it!   Not much. But if you like roleplaying and story the first one is fun to play even with the annoying gameplay.   To add, it comes from computer code/searching: abcd* means search for anything that starts with abcd   I was really disappointed with that, having imported a Shani save into W2   I imported a save and it was there.   Which version are you using? Overwriting or quickbms?   I'm not sure it's better than the original, but kudos to the author/artist. It was adapted very well.   Dr. Schroeder book on genesis in only semi scientific, fyi. The idea is nice, but his analysis falls apart under careful reading.   You can turn off the question marks on your main map. Bam, one section of your complaint is gone. Happy?      Ran out of vRam? something similar happens in Skyrim   I had the same problem, and I eventually got onto a ledge in that corner. It just took a while.   There is none; this is just a comparison to past Witcher games   So Poles weren't oppressed?   It's not compressed vs. uncompressd. It's old vs. new. The Quickbms program which unpacks and repacks the bundle files has a limitation that the files you reimport cannot exceed the size of the original files. Therefore, when editing, you have to make sure anything you add is offset by the same amount of information you delete.   I don't know why Quickbms works like this, but it is an annoying limitation for now.   Same!   What? I'm using nexus as the basis of my explanation.    If you're confused about any part of explanation, just tell me. I know I've assumed some knowledge of modding the Witcher 3 and command line, but this became long enough as it is.   No idea. Email someone? I already tried posting in the forums.      Right now, every non-graphical mod requires that you install its files in a maze of folders which you can quickly get lost in. If you've installed more than 5 mods by now, you realize how confusing this can get; it can be hard to remember which mods you've installed or how to uninstall them.     Credit to polymorpher for their initial explanation which allowed me to understand this. If you haven't read that yet, please do so because I'm assuming that you have that knowledge. [It can be found on Nexus here](http://www.nexusmods.com/witcher3/mods/14/?). Unfortunately, they only explained the what and not the how. I'll go over that now quickly.     **Explanation of how installing the mods work** (modders, skip this part):     Every non-graphical mod you're installing has a similar set of instructions. It requires you to navigate to the directory "The Witcher 3 Wild Hunt\content" and pick a specific subfolder, such as content0 or patch0. then you open the "bundle" folder. This is where the bundle files are kept that contain a lot of the games information that you can edit -- again see polymorpher's explanation for more detail.     The instructions ask you to paste all their files directly into the bundle folder. No, you cannot create a subfolder because of how the files work together. There will be a few things that you are always putting  in there:  *     Quickbms.exe *     A folder *     A .bms file *     A .bat file  If you read polymorpher's guide, you should know what most of these do. Quickbms is the program which unpacks the .bundle file, and the .bms file lets you run quickbms properly. The folder is the output for the .bundle file, and once you edit the output, what you reimport to the the .bundle file.     However, the .bat file is a little different. In general, the .bat extension is a way to tell your computer to run the command line (cmd) for the computer. In these .bat files, the modder puts in code which tells the computer to open quickbms and and then gives the program instructions to reimport from the edited folder -- the same thing you did manually in the tutorial, but now done for you. If you know anything about code, you know it has to be very specific; the code can't choose what files and folders to use like you do when manually running quickbms. The modder has to code exactly where the files and folders are. This means that if you install anything in the wrong place, the program will tell you that the process failed.     The standard code for quickbms:  quickbms [options] script.BMS input_archive/folder [output_folder]  A sample code used for Witcher 3 mods:  quickbms -G -w -r witcher3.bms patch.bundle MyMod  The code does exactly the same thing you did to reimport your code by clicking on a few different screens. More information on how to use quickbms is available here: http://aluigi.alterv...rs/quickbms.txt     The better modders also give you a way to uninstall the mod. So you also are given another .bat file, named uninstall_mymod and another folder which contains the original code for the game that will be reimported.     **Why does this matter?**     So the modder chooses where everything goes, the user has to follow the instructions exactly otherwise the code doesn't work. This is creating a headache for everyone; people are confused, modders are getting complaints, etc; and this is creating a file structure mess where you might not be able to install or uninstall mods correctly.     My proposed solution: There should be standard method of installing mods in a specific directory. This will solve a few problems:     *     Modders don't have to provide the quickbms and witcher3.bms file in every download. Since these are the same with every mod, we can keep these in one place. (And not rename witcher3.bms every time!) *     A file path separate from the rest of the witcher 3 content means that files aren't scattered or lost. This makes finding them, and hence installing/uninstalling them, easy. *     A standard set of instructions for installing mods so people don't get confused by all the different ones. *     For future updates, it's easy to see what is or is not affected.  Now, after all that, my solution is rather simple:  1.     Everyone should create a folder called Mods in the Witcher 3 game folder (the name doesn't actually matter, but it's good for standardization). 1.     Quickbms.exe and witcher3.bms will be placed within mods 1.     Each mod should have it's own subfolder within Mods.  That's the easy bit. Of course, now the .bat files are in a separate place from a lot of the files. I'm going to use the Over 9000 mod (using the 120 edit) to show how to solve this.     Original code: quickbms -G -w -r witcher.bms patch.bundle 120\     Changed code ..\quickbms -G -w -r ..\witcher.bms ..\\..\content\patch0\bundles\patch.bundle 120     The ".." means move to parent directory. So the code says:  1.     Move to the parent directory and launch quickbms 1.     Open the GUI (-G), allow the program to write (-w), launch the reimport function (-r) 1.     Move to the parent directory and use witcher3.bms as the script 1.     Import the information to: Two parent directories up, then the appropriate folder 1.     Use the information contained in the folder 120 (which is in this folder) to import  You can do this for any mod yourself by moving the files to the places I specified, then right clicking the .bat file, hitting "edit," and changing the code as I wrote above.   If we do this, then a lot of headache will be alleviated and this will hopefully start us coalescing into an actual modding community.     And thanks to all the modders who are the ones doing all the hard work!   Still not a great solution - there should be an "exit to game" button.   /r/isrconspiracyracist Spoiler: It is   Because he posts there a lot   It's a bug. Drop the ones you have to make new ones.   I have that too! It's just randomly sitting on the Oxenfort river   It's still bad even with rolling.   It's for grey quests. Green quests give the right amount.   There's a cheat if you're on the PC - you can drag and drop oils to apply them even while in combat. As for the rest, start out as combat and then respec at lvl 15. ;)   Nexus Link! http://www.nexusmods.com/witcher3/mods/143/?   Nexus Link! http://www.nexusmods.com/witcher3/mods/143/?   Someone at nexus posted another mod to get the debug console working. It's not me, I was just going through it to update my mod list. It's pHaZic, who credits Skomsi and Zanzer. Free camera is back!   Thanks! Here's my list from before, revised with the patch updates:  **Important:**  * Fix fall damage! Make it less, automatic roll, etc. Maybe a potion. We should be able to jump from heights like in the Witcher 1 intro video. * ~~More key bindings, fix some of the ones available. For example, right now sheath and dive can only use the same button if you keep the default.~~ FIXED, STILL NEEDS WORK. The biggest issue is the hardcoded bindings while in the menu * ~~Swimming Controls~~ FIXED, TESTED * Horse Controls (ex. doesnt stop randomly, reliably navigate around objects, automatic jumping over low barriers) SOMEWHAT FIXED * **Storage**: Please give innkeepers stashes like in the two previous games, or maybe a 'Travelers Storage chest' at all inns so we don't have to talk to someone to access our stuff. There are many options for this, but I would like to have all the types of witcher armor and swords available somewhere, though not necessarily on me. Maybe Roach should be a storage chest? * More options, especially for potions and bombs, in the quick access wheel, like this: http://www.reddit.com/r/witcher/comments/374d3l/anyone_else_wish_they_had_something_like_this/[3]. This isn't necessarily the answer, but applying oils, switching bombs, and drinking potions is cumbersome right now. It would be alleviated somewhat with extra tabs (see below), but not entirely.  **Combat:**  * Jump while in combat * It seems that if the sword is out, all other items deal ~ as much damage. Is this intentional?  * Larger axis of rotation when aiming crossbow and bombs. There's a small limit right now, and sometimes I can't shoot high enough to hit flying monsters. *  ~~Auto sheathing swords sometimes happens while still in combat but a little far away, or an archer is targeting and you can't parry because you didn't close yet.~~ FIXED * Option to manually turn on and off combat mode.  **Economy:**  * Merchants need a buy back feature at the price it was sold at. Maybe this should be in a different tab so that the sold items don't clog up the main screen. * The buy/sell ratio should be more equalized. Right now it is a little ridiculous for both gameplay and immersion. * There is very little coin in the beginning of the game, and lot once you hit level 12 or so.   * Food and alcohol prices are extremely high.  **HUD:**  * Adjustable minimap size * Slower and larger combat and item log * A toggle button * Smaller size possible~~ * Being able to move it to the actual edge of the screen (adjustable settings don't get it quite there)~~ FIXED * An option for a compass/clock without the minimap  **Map:**  * Zooming out more * Quest filtering/switching on map; maybe have the option show all quests in grey, and clicking on a marker makes it the active quest. * Multiple quests shown * Option to show a map of the inside area of a cave on the large map screen * Custom notes * Icons for merchants, blacksmiths, and armorers dont disappear when they unload * The world map is hard to scroll with a gamepad, the cursor sticks very aggressively to icons.  **Crafting and Alchemy:**  * Monster mutagens could be disassembled/be used for regular upgrades * *A sort function in the crafting window, perhaps by item level or damage/armor so that we don't have to look through everything to find the best one.* **A filter menu was added, a sort function would be even better.** * NEW: Ingredients and alcohol should be listed as already owned when in the inventory * Mutagen bug: Need to reapply them every load in character page to get the base bonus * Tabs in the dismantling menu * The collapsible menus should not reset. * Choosing whether or not to replenish potions and bombs when meditating; and/or choosing to refill potions without meditating. * ~~Hide feature for already crafted potions; on the same note, don't replace the old recipe with the enhanced one.~~ DONE! * Crafting should also have a item is already owned notification when confirming so you don't make something twice * When dismantling items, show how much of the components I already own and how much they are worth. How am I supposed to make a decision between dismantling and selling if I don't know if a component is rare or valuable? * Highlight new recipes * Allow us to auto-buy missing materials from the vendor if he stocks them, or double clicking on the material from the crafting screen to craft it.  Now you have to look at the material missing, look for it in between a huge list then look what do you need to craft it and search again. * Possibly remaking a piece of equipment to rise its level to your own  **Quests:**   * Have active quest appear in the quest menu when opened, and save the drop down state. * Make the flavor text of quests and glossary entries more friendly when they update. * Easy searching of completed quests.  **Inventory:**  * New tab for Books, Letters, and Notes * Books and scrolls should have an additional tooltip line indicating read/unread * Books and letters should have the option to be read when picked up/looted, instead of having to find it in the inventory * New tab for food or potions/oils/decoctions * Different tabs for crafting  amp; alchemy * A sort function with multiple options (weight, price, quality, level req., name, etc.). Or more minimally, don't sort them by pickup time, because this creates a lot of clutter, especially in the usable items tab.

Either expand the grids or use it in another way? * **Maybe**: A list option instead of a grid system  **Other/Controversial/Inane:**  * Better navigation of menus (e.g. quick exit) * Option to turn subtitles off for English/chosen language but keep them for the other languages in game in order to understand them. * More higher level quests * Better leveling -- doing all the side quests leaves you way over leveled * Better trophies * Fix item weight (feline armor set should not weigh more than griffen!) * More things to do, people to talk to after the main story * Rewards that correlate to quest level. My blade of the bits was level 15 because that's when I started the quest, even though I ended it at level 19 or so.

 It requires even more intelligence to listen to solid advice, both legal and financial.

Women are marvelous invention and indeed change the way we interact and mange ourselves in the modern world.       you pretty much stop flopping around positions long before you get to 55.  That's actually a bad thing. Not that you should flip your position just for the sake of it, but there's also a natural progress in human behavior, and I hope that when I'll be in my 50's I'll still be open to see that's going in the world, what's working and what's not - and adapt accordingly.   I don't see any shame in saying "I used to think like that, but times have changed and I changed my mind". Better than the opposite.

Edit: maybe [this one?](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/25jswe/wp_a_little_girl_is_terrified_of_the_monster/)   Really, this again?   * The increase in minimum wage is stretched to 3 years, so there's really no reason to believe there's a connection now, unless you want to find one.  * the official statement from the company is that prices increased by 10%. So where did the 14% came from? few items in few locations were increased by 14%. not the average price. Nobody went to check what's the cause for those items. could be wages could be not. We won't know if we won't check. * Nationwide prices were increased by 4%, in SF by 10% on average. So again, we are talking about 6% premium. Where this number came from? Maybe real estate? maybe taxes? Maybe other places increase also by 6% compared to their increase some place else? * unlike what people, chain restaurants like Chipotle don't rely on local markets for supplies. They have distribution centers. So price will only affect those working on site. It doesn't explain why certain ingredients increased more than others.   * What about other restaurants? shouldn't we see 14% increase as well if the logic is so infallible?  I mean come on, you are going to see two 14% numbers and spit out all the regular well rehearsed material about minimum wage implications?   We all know about the relation, we all know 101 economics, fine. But this article doesn't provide even anecdotal evidence to that connection.   Are you replying to me? because what you wrote doesn't make sense.   I didn't say I'm Krugmanite, nor did I say I support loose monetary policy or Keynesianism. So really you are talking to yourself there (but hey, it's easy to win this argument, right?).  All I said is that it's hard to find example of austerity because very few countries have tried it. And if austerity policies are rare then successful ones are even harder to come by.   Actually, I was repeating what you said! you dared the person you replied to come up with example of true austerity measured, and you are right. Those almost don't exist.  So you can argue pro austerity all you want, that's fine, but don't send anyone to history books because this chapter is very thin and nothing can be concluded from it.   "I didn't sign up for this shit" - his mother   Can you link me to their touring bikes collection page? Can't find it in Google translate.   Edit: Okay, I think I found it. It's called trekking.      Yeah, I was about to do it last night, and all I was missing were protective contact lenses, so I called the whole thing off and watched TV instead.    Before you do that I recommend you actually find a country which really applied austerity  That's exactly the point. Most countries never applied austerity, yet all them recovered from recessions and depressions they faced in the past. Some even preferred to default on their debt.   There are so few austerity case studies to learn anything from it. But there are plenty of examples of countries that spent/printed/inflated/defaulted/re-arranged and recovered successfully.     you have to cut spending  No, you don't have to.   A country can default on its debt ([lots of them did in the past](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_sovereign_defaults), probably more than people realize), or, as more common solution, print money to pay the creditors (and spend some domestically) and probably devalue the currency on the way.  Now, I'm not saying those are good solutions, but they are available solutions just like austerity.   OP asked about Greece, so it's important to note that Greece doesn't have an option to print money (which is the real issue here) and defaulting also has some consequences that sovereign debtors usually don't face.  Very few countries in history, including those who defaulted, actually applied austerity measures.    Full album at Bandcamp: [Tensleep](http://oldabrambrown.bandcamp.com/album/tensleep).      Their biggest screw up was Jordan's 2 years off.   Handed it over to Houston. Houston had a lousy 94-95 season (less than 50 wins, if I remember correctly, #6 or #7 seed) and defeated Utah in first round. They then defeated Phoenix after being 0-2 and 1-3. For the conference finals they had the Spurs (I think) and then swept Shaq's Orlando.      Or, you can simply start it late. If you know when you want the food ready.         I second *Daemon*.

You just wrote 'Not questionable rape cases', are they in the scope now? how come? lack of imagination probably. Have you reviewed all the cases that slipped away from DP and positive that none of them deserved it?    Okay. The problem is that because we differentiate between one murder and another (and I'm not saying we shouldn't), it's almost impossible to determine those special circumstances you are talking about.  It's easy to look in hindsight and determine who should live and who should die, but it's very hard to write coherent laws that look *forward* and will cover different scenarios while being fair, not giving too much power to the state or too much loopholes to render them useless.    Yeah, but those 'special occasions' are what's causing it to drag so many years. Also, why one murder is different than another?    Yeah, I'm surprised so many people talk about the money and not about the moral questions it raises. If it's 'the right thing to do' then you just need to make it more efficient. And if it's 'wrong', then it should be stopped regardless of price.    A mistake only a faggot OP will make ;)  Excellent post btw.   Germans are the worst at parties, 76 years and counting.

The book stands on its own, but it's also part of a *The Karla Trilogy* (*The Honourable Schoolboy*,*Smiley's People*) which let further explore Smiley and Karla.  *The man he knew as "Control" is dead, and the young Turks who forced him out now run the Circus. But George Smiley isn't quite ready for retirementespecially when a pretty, would-be defector surfaces with a shocking accusation: a Soviet mole has penetrated the highest level of British Intelligence. Relying only on his wits and a small, loyal cadre, Smiley recognizes the hand of Karlahis Moscow Centre nemesisand sets a trap to catch the traitor.*      I think it's less about the absolute wage and more about the difference between tech jobs and other jobs.   For example, even if a tech job pays well in Sweden, a bright kid might prefer to take a less stressful job, like being a teacher. The salary is good enough and the premium wage of software engineering in a start-up isn't worth the stress, the long hours and the risk.  Now take a bright kid from a low income family in the US. For him working in a start-up or hi tech company - even if the pay is average - still can be the difference between living comfortably and barely escaping poverty.  The income inequality, which is greater in the US than any other country in Europe ^^[source](http://www.oecd.org/social/inequality.htm#income) , plays a big role in risk taking appetite.

The only true sub that truly promote naive questions, spreading knowledge and real science to all.   I think he's smart enough not to dilute it.       By the way, I majored in Math. My best friend majored in Physics. I think his degree was much more difficult than mine. He thought the opposite.   The difficult level got a lot to do with the student abilities towards certain areas. For me Math is easy. Physics is hard. Philosophy is much harder. Another friend of mine studied literature, and as much I love reading, I would probably have failed.   My point was that getting the degree, compared to history, is trivial. For example, when my friend's father had his engineering degree 50 years back, there was 1 university in the country where he lived, with 35 spots open every year. You didn't make it? too bad, wait for next year. There was one store that sold books, there weren't exams databases, nobody offered him any loan. and for women there were dozens of other obstacles to overcome. And at his time, about 10% had a degree. today it's 50%. That says a lot.     More pics at [Camille Rowe (@fingermonkey)  Instagram](https://instagram.com/fingermonkey/?hl=en). Created this cute [gif](http://i.imgur.com/BVs4L2u.gif) from there.      'Are you not entertained?' Screamed the gladiator. 'Yes!' Shouted the crowd back. 'Good, that will be additional 9% on your entry ticket.'   Benfleck always look uncomfortable, that's his thing.    Yeah, physics is also very trivial.   Now, I'm not saying the studies are easy, far from it. Not in philosophy and neither in arts nor in physics. But it's simply very common. Getting into university or college, and getting a degree - any degree - isn't that special.  I didn't say anything about the difficulties of the studies, I personally would probably fail in philosophy, arts, and the other 90% of available degrees. But finding the degree that fits you and getting into high education - is not as hard as it used to (let's say 30 years ago).  So yes, even if you are STEP major, good for you, but don't expect anyone to be impressed by it.     Ninjatrader has a nice automatic and programmable system, starting from a simple wizard with lots of default conditions up to full blown, non sandbox, c# programming. They also offering brokerage services of their own, or you can pick one of the supported brokers.    one of the greatest shames of modern education is emphasizing professionalization of undergraduates versus overall education  There is a good reason for that. In modern days overall education isn't a big achievement. High education is available to everybody, graduating isn't hard and in most cases isn't very expensive. Universities and colleges are bigger and more accessible than ever, some of them are even online. Getting a liberal art degree, or simply high education, doesn't give any bragging rights like it used to.   So yeah, "Philosophy and many of the other liberal arts are legitimate fields of study", just don't expect a pat on the back for doing something very trivial nowadays.  The professional world however is getting more competitive by the day, with very limited spots and ever growing supply of candidates all over the world.   ---  edit: Okay, looks I didn't explain my point properly. **Nearly 40 percent of working-aged Americans now hold a college degree, according to a new report from the Lumina Foundation**. Something that 40% of population does **isn't special**.  I simply responded to "emphasizing professionalization of undergraduates versus overall education". Of course it does, because getting overall education is something that doesn't need any support.  I'm not saying anything about how difficult the studies are. The fact that 40% the work force gets a degree proves that it's **very achievable**.  And yes, I'm talking about any high education. STEM included.

It's usually 5-6 doctors, and there were several devices because there were several computers.    Meaning, if this was developed in Google's office in Nairobi instead of Mountain View, this wouldn't have happened.    This remained a mystery. The company that supplied us with the scanner acknowledged the issue, but didn't provide any information. Eventually we had to abandon the whole thing, for several reasons. This was one of them, as Indian doctors  common in US hospitals.  This was about 15 years ago, so I'm sure the technology had advanced greatly since. Maybe this is why you personally didn't have any issue in the past years.      The enormous increase in the quantity of currency precipitated an era of hyperinflation in the Confederacy as more dollars chased fewer goods. The price level in the South rose by roughly 10 percent per month during the conflict and by the end of the war, the price level had increased in the Confederacy by a factor of 92, though imports tended to inflate more quickly and exports more slowly. At the same time, the blockade, military destruction, and the loss of workers to the war caused real wages and output to fall dramatically, with per-capita consumption falling by 50 percent in real terms. Indeed, if banks had not sharply increased their reserve ratios for fear of bank runs, the inflation created by excess money in the South would likely have been even more severe.   The Confederate government passed the Currency Reform Act of 1864 in an effort to stem the rampant inflation ravaging the South. The Act effectively removed one third of all currency in the South from circulation by mandating that all large denomination bills be converted to 4 percent Treasury bonds before April 1, 1864, and imposing a 3-to-2 redemption ratio for small bills after the deadline. As people tried to get rid of their large notes, velocity spiked and in the months prior to the deadline, inflation rose to 23 percent a month. In the summer of 1864, though, price levels in the Confederacy finally stabilized and even declined slightly, just as monetary theory would predict following a contraction in the money supply. However, in the face of continuing pressure to meet war obligations, Congress authorized the printing of an additional $275 million in August of 1864, mostly reversing the effects of the Currency Reform Act.      A company I used to work for sold finger print readers to users. The target users were doctors in hospitals (to access our software without entering password).   The reader systematically failed reading and identifying Indian doctors.    I don't think you should expect employers to do police work and check workers' origin and legal status. And if so, why stop at employers? Why not put in prison every Walmart manager that sells goods to illegals? If they can't buy food, no reason to come.  If you want to stop illegal immigration, tighten the border, and accept that some will pass. Also accept it's not a bad thing.   Modern day Dickens.   Is that episode with the health inspection? alright, alright, alright, that episode was amazingly good.             "Sure, we can use your contract. Our lawyers will have to approve it first - because nobody in their right mind will sign ANYTHING without running it through legals (nor they are allowed to), and that will cost you $1,000/hr in legal fees, which I'm sure you wouldn't mind paying"    Who wouldn't?      I find Scott Kelby's books to be accessible and useful with the basics. Straight, no non-sense advice on how to shoot in different scenarios. The series is called *Scott Kelby's Digital Photography* and I think it has 4 volumes. His Adobe Lightroom book is also good if you use this program.    There could be dozens of reasons for that, and it's usually clear only in hindsight. The typical reasoning is that investors and money managers sees the USD as safer. Meaning, the risk at holding euro doesn't compensate enough relatively to the yield.  The effect on trade is causing European goods cheaper to USD holders and having USA goods more expensive to Euro holders.   On one hand it strengthen the USD financial market (there's is more demand for financial instruments traded in dollar) and on the other hand it weakens the export companies that manufacture in USD and sell in Euro.   There isn't a clear cut answer to the cause and effect. It's a complicated machine.   The rate by itself doesn't mean much, it's just an arbitrary number. What you care about is the change in rate.  If one currency is getting more expensive compared to another, it means that this currency is in more demand compared to the second one.   Why do people prefer to sell the second currency and get the first one?   They think it's a better vehicle to keep value. Meaning, the first currency will keep its purchasing power better than the second currency. The value of the currency encapsulates interest rates, sovereign risk, inflation risks, future demand (by other investors) and future supply (by the central banks).     That's the correct answer.   He quoted from the article, so obviously he at least clicked it. He also quoted a line that is written after the energy reason is mentioned. So I really don't see why you need to push the "nobody's clicking the link" circlejerk.  (maybe we should start "nobody is reading the comment they are replying to")  On top of that, his question is legit and you didn't answer it.   Two of the main costs of manufacturing are the labor and the electricity  Good. He's asking if the energy savings offset possible future labor costs. Do you have an answer for that? The article doesn't seem to compare future labor costs among different countries.    You can't go wrong with any of those:  1. The Idiot 2. The Brothers Karamazov 3. Crime and Punishment  4.

When I was 5 years old, my mother always told me that happiness was the key to life. When I went to school, they asked me what I wanted to be when I grew up. I wrote down happy.

It's a bit different. Thinking: Fast and Slow is more academical in nature, more serious, founded and deeper. *You are not so smart* is more anecdotal and lighter.          Personal experience in movies, and I would argue especially in comedies, got a lot to do with your personality *at that moment*. So it's not only whether this type of humor touches you, but also the mood you are at, the company you watch with, the theater experience, etc.  Sure, some movies are genuinely bad or brilliantly good, but for the majority of films, it's really a personal experience and timing. Someone can enjoy a movie and only later be aware of its flaws. If someone watches a movie with a notebook to write down used tropes, he isn't going to have a good time.  I used to hate comedies, but I learned to love them by letting go and matching them to my general mood. Hell, I even laughed in Horrible Bosses 2, a movie I wouldn't even dare watching few years back.

[You Are Not So Smart: Why You Have Too Many Friends on Facebook, Why Your Memory Is Mostly Fiction, and 46 Other Ways You're Deluding Yourself by David McRaney](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11709037-you-are-not-so-smart).   Whether youre deciding which smart phone to purchase or which politician to believe, you think you are a rational being whose every decision is based on cool, detached logic, but heres the truth: You are not so smart. Youre just as deluded as the rest of us--but thats okay, because being deluded is part of being human.   Growing out of David McRaneys popular blog, You Are Not So Smart reveals that every decision we make, every thought we contemplate, and every emotion we feel comes with a story we tell ourselves to explain them, but often these stories arent true. Each short chapter--covering topics such as Learned Helplessness, Selling Out, and the Illusion of Transparency--is like a psychology course with all the boring parts taken out.   Bringing together popular science and psychology with humor and wit, You Are Not So Smart is a celebration of our irrational, thoroughly human behavior.   Faith in snakes = restored.

To put it in words (in addition to all the technical and correct explanation you received), it means the momentum in the market is fading. Meaning, the market is going up as fast as it did. It's like a car slowing down. Does a car has to slow down before it stops in reverse? sure. Does it stop and reverse EVERY TIME it slows down? of course not. Indicators are tricky.    Or organic.              money has been draining out of the market  Money cannot be drained out. For every seller there's a buyer.    stock market's cap has been increasing  This happens for specific companies because buyers and sellers are settling at higher prices. And on top of that, it happens at the total market if there are more IPOs than write-offs.    if US investors are net sellers of US equities, I must presume that foreign investors are net buyers  It doesn't matter really who's doing the buying or selling. for every buyer there's a seller.  The only argument that can be made is if the sellers are smarter than the buyers. So if, for example, you hear that some big shot hedge fund manager sold his FB shares and million barbers, taxi drivers, redditors and gas stations operators bought each a share, then you might argue that something is going on here.  Unfortunately, it's never a clear cut, only on extreme market conditions. And right now, this is not the case. I'm not saying that market will go up or down, I don't know.

If we want regulated markets that protect small investors from doing stupid shit with their money, that's a reasonable and accepted part of the plan.  2. Most startups won't even accept investments of less than few hundred thousands dollars. So it makes sense to limit the investment to "accredited investors".   3. If you do have half a million dollar, and it's all your money, and you really want to invest in some start up despite better judgement, there are easy and legal ways to achieve that.   4. Most start ups fail. You know what else fails? This article. It doesn't mention the hundreds of start ups that go bust and give zero money back to investors, but instead keeps dropping names like Facebook and Linked In.  5. Most of the "accredited investors" are white men, but how is this relevant? It's like saying the Yacht market is blocked to black people. Wealth inequality exists,so let's deal with it. I don't see any added value by putting it in a stock market regulation article.     	200
 If you don't want to read Pippi Longstockings I can recommend Ronja Rvardotter or Brderna Lejonhjrta. They're not aimed at as young an audience as most of her other books. And are more in line with traditional fantasy genre.    First post here.   I enjoyed The Lost Symbol on a vacation 2009. Almost as much as The Da Vinci Code. But after having read almost 300 pages of Inferno, I just don't feel it.   The mysteries and puzzles are nowhere to be seen, and it feels like the plot has been one big chase for a third of the book. (Run! Oh nice hiding place! Oh fuck, the police! Run! Oh nice hiding place! Etc.)  The secondary character is pretty interesting but hasn't had that much of screen time.    I just want to know. Is the book worth getting through? Does it get as good as the previous two books in the series, or close to it? Because as of now I just want to quit it.    I'm more amazed by the quality of the Russian video than I am by the fish.    I'm sure it must seem that way if you only ever read the comments of the posts that hit the front page and never actually watch or read the stuff we are talking about.

But I'm fairly sure that IF Bernie becomes President he will be able speak to the entire American and everyone will listen. Once he has that power he will say that there is a dire need for everyone to take a good look at their representative local politicans and make sure they have voted in their best interest. If not. Find someone who has and support them instead.  If he wins. Things will change for the better for you. Mark my words.

That personal key is then used as a foreign key between the two friends in the database  This is the only info about the user that is stored in the MySQL database. There is a web service you can visit, but there is basically only a link to google play store there.  I'm sorry if you don't get enough information. I don't know how to explain appropriately.  I'll make sure to double check the protocols and take a look at Auth2.   I broke down for a split second. I am so humbled how kids take the prospect of death :( There was a girl about the age of 10 in my community who had a similar scenario, I don't remember what illness she suffered from. But she took it with about the same calmness. Although I imagine there was some real  grief  behind closed doors their strength is astonishing and truly admirable.    Ah. The flowery penis. Let's dance around it!    I know about the bomb, but if anyone is like me. They might miss something that is literary in front of their eyes their whole time. I do that all of the time. Once I lost a tv controller for two weeks, and it was beside the tv the entire time..  We need to get people really aware of the moneybomb before it's time.   Ha ha, I think I want you to explain. :-)   I have thought about it some. And I think he must have existed in some way of another.    The location data won't touch a database ever.. Only temporary stored locally within the app and on the friend's app that you have actively chosen to share your location with.   When you choose to end the sharing,  all stored location data is erased from both clients.    I'm sorry. That was a good comment you linked to. I didn't go that far back as to more than a *month back in time* But I still didn't see a post from you in this sub, and the few ones I saw on the subject of Bernie were strangely familiarly formulated not discussing any policy of his. Just broad key words like socialism, anti globalism, stagnated economy. Etc, etc.   I didn't accuse you in that sense. It's just there has been A LOT of fresh accounts coming here trying to cool things down. And when you didn't answer my question if you think Bernie has got enough name recognition but instead talked about how neutral you are  I began suspecting something was wrong. And I waited a good while before I said something about it.   I just thought that everyone agreed what Bernie's main concern is, is a certain other runner's name recognition that Bernie really lack. And found it weird you didn't think so.   Not everyone needs to be a vocal supporter. I don't think that.   I'm sorry if I offended you. I hope we can put our "pitchforks"  down and be civil. You seem like a good guy that stand up for what you believe. And hopefully we can end this discussion here on good terms because I really don't have time to do this anymore.    I can see how that's your response. No previous post or comment in this sub, and your first one is to stall this going viral.    First. I know there are Israeli communities that work. That's not relevant when talking about Bernie Sanders. So why you would bring it up to a hater is beyond me. And why you would hang out in a subreddit which very name is "Bernie for President" and not think he will win the general if he wins the primary. I'm not a campaign representative either. Heck. I won't even before for him. Because I can't. But Me and dare I say it everyone else are in this sub to promote good ideas on how to make Bernie the next president. And I don't feel you have done that at even a single time.   And second. Your first response basically said that you think the name recognition Bernie Sanders is getting from msnc is plenty. And you think this viral campaign is "badly timed"   I'm calling it. Call me a loony if you want. I think we got a Shill. A sneaky one at that.   And that's all I got for this time folks. I don't have time for this anymore. But that's my opinion.    That's great. I would love to be able to donate. But am neither allowed to nor have the spare money to do so sadly.   And of course you should be open minded and I praise you for it.  But I looked and you haven't written anything positive at all. Not that is perfectly clearly positive.   And you even wrote in a thread about bernie in response to someone who don't think socialism works.... in /r/politics and I quote: "Actually. Socialism does work out well.....When applied on a small scale like the tiny communal villages in Israel."    I know that YOU know that he isn't a absolute Socialist. And you explained that in a later post. But people won't always read every answer all the time. And I don't think that the first comment you made really benefit Bernie. Actually it is kind of a shitty comment to make if you advocate for Bernie because the American people don't know the difference between branches of socialism.   And I think everyone here that wants more followers of bernie need to think about what they say in relation to him because not everyone know what he talks about. They might only know he's a Socialist and that is what we need to change. Correct me on that last statement of I'm wrong. And any other statement or assumption I made.  But I think my opinion is well founded, and I would love someone's opinion on that.       I'll eat your other one. And I'm gonna tell you how to accomplish that. Exchange Students. And I've been saying this for a while.   American students abroad, and foreign students in America will make this a global issue. I think Sweden can use a bit of the billionair talk. We abolished the inheritance tax some years ago..... And the new budget yesterday didn't mention the really wealthy...   And I'm sure it's not just Sweden. UK got a real (real)  problem too.  Some insanely rich Swedes are actually moving to UK because of this.    edit: So.  You think he get's enough name recognition?   Just to end my curiosity. How come, every comment you previously made about bernie make about him or any of his policies come across as completely neutral but seems to point towards pre ww2 politics, anti globalism and other short general expressions?? There is no positive feedback. Only subtle resent as I take it.   I'm just curious and you are free to explain this and we're done here.   Because we have different opinions and mine is.   The time to act, is now. Not later.    I hope to see your work here on this sub. You're good.    Edit: I see how my point didn't come across at all... . If people would have their eyes opened to how different Bernie is to every other candidate just because the fact he didn't take money from any big companies or other interests. You might be able to get it to stick.. HARD  That said.  I think name recognition is the top priority right now though?    It is really appealing over all.  And the text is really soothing. Although it didn't fit as well in the other video where there was a person in the centre talking. It kind of stole the show.    Maybe the Bernie [offical logo](http://i97.photobucket.com/albums/l217/Shockwave_73/Album%203/Bernie%202016_zps32ug56jh.jpg)?  Or is that not allowed?   Agreed. Now that it's out there in the pit that is the internet we have to act quickly.   EDIT: IMPORTANT  **Tl ; Dr** conchobarrmacness has no previous post  in /r/bernieforpresident.  and  we have a long and extremely boring discussion below. My opinion: I think he subtly speaks against bernie. That may be because that's just his way of expression. Or it might not be. Quotes below.  two comments down he basically says this video campaign needs to go viral later,  not now because Bernie already got a lot of name recognition.  Correct me if I'm wrong.  (he never respond to why he said that, even though I ask him several times)   On an ending note, after the "wow"  response. I'm positive. This needs to go viral asap.  End edit.    A viral video can include something that puts another candidate in a different light than they are currently in. And it is achievable by just speaking the truth in good manners. Without saying anything negative about anyone.   What the hell is that about? What are new account's posts about? This should be informed about on the sub.   **I** like the feeling of the hashtag, but bern could easily be made into burn (something like "socialist gonna burn capitalism to the ground" or something crazy and untrue like that. It would scare a lot of people)   Propaganda is already active, and soon they are gonna be desperate   I just don't think it's worth the risk of it blowing up in our face in a couple of months.   It's a 15 second video. 1 day notice would be enough notice to get to a hairdresser and record 5 awful videos before finally getting a good one. But let's say we wait for 3 or 4 days just to get the message out on doing this thing. We need to be coordinated.   Let this post reach the front page first. Which it probably will. Anyone **keeping tabs** on Bernies movements have already got hold of this, but not his casual followers. We need them to come along.   Same here. As a European I really don't know anything I can do except spreading his message here on reddit.     Did you make all the graphics and pictures and stuffs for "Society, A Perpetual Cycle"? or just parts, like the text? (which works superbly well together with the voice)   I'm watching it now. Yeah. It's like he cares. Feels weird.  Europe too huh? :)  edit: Don't forget to post the video directly here on this sub so that it can get some well deserved attention.  	112

By the way, this:  If you accept that dying will happen, and try your best to learn from your deaths, the deaths themselves will become less frequent.  is a badass quote.   Thanks everyone for your great advice. I'm going to pick the game up and get stuck in, and bear with it a while. Can't tell you how appreciative I am for your comments.   Thanks for your advice VonStreff. Yes I must say I have been put off by the Dark Souls reputation but great to know that Bloodborne is still enjoyable. And I suppose 1 death per hour isn't bad!   Hi everyone,  This game is so highly rated and looks amazing, but I would really love to know why it is that you like it so much. I really want to buy this game and like it, but the idea of constantly dying and reloading in games doesn't really sound like my cup of tea, it just sounds like punishment.  Do you really die every 5 seconds like people say? And do you have to be an amazing hardcore gamer to be able to play? Are the lowered difficulty levels?  Any advice is much appreciated!    Ayy-oh!   /r/thathappened    Hi guys,  Located in BNE, Australia. I have been having huge problems with ISP traffic congestion on my ADSL2+ network between the hours of 5-10pm, which I understand is peak traffic time. What is frustrating me is that there appear to be few other options available for a steady data transfer rate at all times.  My wired connection runs at 10mbps during the day, then drops as low as 0.5mbps to 2mbps at peak times, making streaming video difficult.  Is a 4G WIFI router a viable alternative? I get download rates of 100mbps over the 4G cellular network at peak times and this would be far more preferrable.  Does anyone have any experience with this sort of thing?

That's what happens when you wear burlap sacks for shoes OP   What the f...where am I??   Cain married his twin sister, and had children with her, and Abel had children from his twin sisters. It is indeed mentioned in the bible (Genesis, chapter 5, verse 4) that Adam and Eve had also daughters: And the days of Adam after he had begotten Seth were eight hundred years: and he begat sons and daughters.   Ah yes I see. Whoops!   That just made the verse super funny to me   I thought so. So why are some Christians so up in arms and using homosexuality as their argument? Seems if they have a problem with being gay they should protest that instead of marriage? Marriage has never been a solely Christian tenement so I feel I must be missing something here......???   Can someone help me out? (non-American here). 'Man shalt not lie with a woman as they do a man, it is an abomination' - this seems to be the go-to argument. But they're referencing homosexuality which has been legal for more than 50 years. To me this is not the point in case, today's ruling is a victory for civil liberties and equal rights, not actually being gay. Or am I wrong here?   Someone please explain this to me (non-American here). 'Man shalt not lie with a woman as they do a man, it is an abomination' - this seems to be the go-to argument.

Wow that is some mild annoyance   Thanks for the feedback! I'll add this one in as an option.       ;)   The top two comments on a tumblr post are always something along the lines of:  * *wow* * *this is fucking thought provoking* * *this is the deepest thing I've ever fucking read* * *truth*  Who are these people       Also, 1ml (or 1cm3) of water weighs 1 gram, and takes one kilojoule of energy to heat it by 1 degree Celcius. Aaaaahhh the metric system :)   Lots of employee comments here, I wondered if anyone could lend advice from the other angle; I am a manager of a small business, I have four fantastic hard working staff under me. I can almost never fault their effort and detail the put in. How can I reward them for the work and show that I appreciated them? And also, if the constantly give me 100%, how can I make sure they don't burn out and keep enjoying what they do?  Any suggestions welcome - thanks all.   I was born in '22 and I am 93.   What the f....   Very true, I hadn't considered the smaller builds. I think I'm with you, the $400 doesn't seem worth it. Thanks for your advise hghdra, much appreciated.   Yeah...tell me about it. No space for a PC set up, and I need the 17" screen and internal optical drive as my wife needs to use it too and it's her compromise. It's frustrating, because I know I could build a better PC for far cheaper!   Yeah, it's a fair amount of money...AUD2199 to AUD2599 with the 970M. But, comes with Witcher 3 included so I've got that going for me I guess. Haha.   Hi all, trying to decide whether the extra ~$400 is worth it to upgrade to the [P37W](http://www.gigabyte.com.au/products/product-page.aspx?pid=5349) from the lead in [P37K](http://www.gigabyte.com.au/products/product-page.aspx?pid=5375). The laptops are not cheap so I am trying to keep it reasonable. I specifically need a relatively high powered, thin gaming machine with internal optical drive at a min 17" screen.  From what I can see, the only difference is the upgrade from a [GTX 965M](http://www.notebookcheck.net/NVIDIA-GeForce-GTX-965M.134120.0.html) to a GTX 970M in the P37W. According to GPUBoss, the 970M is up to 35% more powerful, has a larger memory bus and higher clock speed.  Does anyone have an opinion as to whether the GPU upgrade would be worth the extra cash? I'd love some help. Also, please let me know if I am overthinking things and the 965M is perfectly solid.  Thanks!   Oh great, thanks bernie. I'll check these out  	33

 You can't really hear those quad copters.     Especially if you're inside.     They don't really make sound.... they are there... and then they are gone.    Most people think its just some dude playing with his new toy if they do see it.      I fly my quadcopter over the street and into the park... most people don't even look up at it.  and the one's that do.... "OH COOL!!! I WANT ONE!"      All because he was missing a front license plate.    Why do cops always want to just escalate the situation?   Every interaction I've had with police, even just routine traffic stops, they are so fucking MAD.   I have to ask them to calm down so that we can handle the situation in a calm and professional manner.             How could the owner of stolen dildos NOT have awesome sniper aim.    360 no scope even.     And then I roared like a miniature banshee.      Its kind of clear that I made the whole story up just to throw in the surprise dildo line.  But you are correct... I wouldn't just go blasting away at the sky with an AR-15... lest the round comes down at an angle and hits someone a mile or so away.      You just tell give the drone grids to criss cross and search for the vulnerabilities.    You can cover a lot more locations in this manner than you would just by using a car.       All fictional stories aside... I'd rather reddit start a gofundme for my work here in the philippines.    I have been helping communities rebuild after Yolanda.    One particular baranguay, Santa Cruz, in San Francisco Southern Leyte, desperately needs a water system repair.  These people don't have water...in the jungle.       I blew the funding for it by accidentally telling the man I was to meet with to "go back to the fucking usa" about 2 days before our meeting.  He was flipping out about a woman breastfeeding inside McDonald's in Tacloban.   I didn't know who he was or care.  It was pure coincidence.    2 days later, he walked into the hotel lobby, sees me, laughs and walks out.   I blew the funding for water project for over 1200 people.    So I've been trying to fund some of the repairs out of pocket.   But I can't afford to drop 40,000 dollars to fix them up.   I'd rather not take out a personal loan... but I will if it comes to that.     Edit: I felt like editing it.   Edit2:  Hey thanks!     Why?  You can program the drone to fly to coordinates on it's own.     No need to waste gas driving around slowly... just send the drone and relax at home while you read the feedback.     I actually did that.  I don't know who the drone belongs to... but they were flying it around my property with a camera on it.     I shot it with my AR-15.      No more drone.... and no more snooping in my windows or stealing my dildos.     I fully support the idea of retesting for license renewals.  And especially of those 65 years old or older.  They should need to retest every 5 years.       What I can't figure out is why cops need assault rifles on top of it all.        No no... they released the edited video... then acted like they didn't know that they edited it or even agree that it was edited... but it's clear by the looping/repeating video segments that it was very much edited.     Suck one little dick and that's all I'll ever be known for.     This is why body cams are a ridiculous notion.  The cops will just edit the video.  And when they get caught they will "look into it".  So what good is evidence gathering if they can just edit it?      I grew up as one of the few white people in a new Orleans school.  I didn't know racism existed until I moved to Atlanta.   I have a problem with entitlements only when people who don't need them take them.    These corporations are plenty profitable without subsidies.   I am 100 percent any kind of corporate welfare.   Adding one cookie to lunch does not make the lunch junk food.   The cafeteria feeds pizza and chips and packs of 2 cookies that are huge and almost pure shortening.  Don't forget the fried chimichanga and the mystery meat.     Adding a cookie to your kids sandwich and carrot sticks is not "junk food".   It's dessert.  And sugar in moderation is a part of your body's nutritional requirements.     You started by giving grief about feeding a kid one cookie with their lunch.  You act like that's all he feeds his kid for lunch.    You're a troll... that much is VERY obvious.  One cookie each day doesn't make anyone unhealthy.   Try hours.   A car is 1 hr drive to work for some.   Look troll..  you can have a cookie with your lunch if the rest of it is healthy.     [Plasma gasification](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasma_gasification) doesn't need a continued power source.  Once the temp is high enough, it runs itself off what you shove into it.   Like garbage.    It also recovers elements and gases and also provides other useful byproduct that is extremely hard and strong.     The problem is... the upstart cost.  It won't turn a profit for long time.   But I'd argue that profit is a stupid reason to generate power.   That's a whole different of worms tho.....    Mine is only 99. From the US.   Just use Google.   Plenty of companies offer it.    If you can't afford 7 bucks a month to protect  premium priced phone then you shouldn't be buying the premium phone.   Case in point: now it's a total loss.  700 dollar loss To someone that can't afford a 7 dollar monthly and a 200 dollar deductible for a total of 284 bucks...  to replace a 700 dollar phone.     How could you NOT afford that.     I broke my note 3 and replaced it with 99 buck deductible insurance    If he relies on basically slave labor then I don't give a fuck about his lawn service.   Plenty of lawn service companies exist that pay their employees fairly.   They'll fill the gap.   Why not?  Bunch of young dudes riding in the car... lauging at the white rapper with the mousey look to him?    "Chuck that shit out the window, bro."    "okay!"         I'm logistics engineer.  It is perfectly possible to have contingency plans in place in case shit happens.   There is not a single business that is so unstable that it cannot plan for its future.    And it doesn't require workers devote their lives to the company and not receive benefits.  And it does not require a company to take away the freedoms of the employees to secure additional sources of income for their families.      No no... you don't get it.    This doesn't stop an employer from filling a position that was abandoned by the employee.     This just stops an employer from demanding the employee's entire life belongs to them.      Moneydance.     white stuff.   I put a quarter on the top and pull it back... the tension can make the quarter fly up and hit the ceiling.        Ahhh yes.   Before TEd talks started to suck.     sniff..... Mmmemories...     and then some words I don't know.       [This one.](http://www.computerworld.com/article/2936346/byod/samsung-swiftkey-mitm-itbwcw.html)  And the thing is, samsung had a fix just kicking it on the shelf but couldn't push it out on account the carrier wants it's dick in everything.     And this problem didn't effect unlocked devices because those did not have swiftkey bloatware.   You know.. that stuff that makes your phone "cheaper" and ruins the battery life.  Simply turning off the swiftkey or uninstalling it did not fix the security hole.  Once it was installed, it was embedded in the system.     And the people with unlocked devices, that voluntarily installed swiftkey, were able to remove it by reflashing the rom.   But verizon demands its devices be locked down "for protection of the network".   There is not a single fucking case where an unlocked device has harmed the network.   So verizon also likes to claim it's for support reasons.  Welp... here's a case where holding people's hands and locking their devices actually caused a massive fucking support issue.     The ultimate point is: STOP BUYING THE RIP-OFF SUBSIDIZED LOCKED DEVICES, PEOPLE!!! It's bullshit.   You'll save money by having the freedom to shop around for carriers. And you won't have all your personal data get ripped off by bloatware hacks.    Edit: And lastly, people with unlocked devices fixed that 5.0.1 memory leak a LONG time ago.      I am a rider.   But for my car I have a custom bumper sticker I had printed that says, "If I have to look twice, you have to ride nice."   You can go to /r/gore and see all gear all the time and the rider still ends up a slushy.  So... maybe that's why I'm not a dick when I ride.  Dicks die a bloody ripped apart death.     If I have to spend a long time next to another vehicle, I don't hang out in its blindspot... I either drop back or pull ahead and give them a "hello i'm here polite salute".   Many drivers appreciate it and will help keep clearance around me.      Awwww dude!  I fucking LOVED these magazines when I was a kid.  And little science books.  One came with a packet of agar mix.  And it taught how to collect samples and identify what grew in it.     Sometimes they'd have optical illusions and then explain how they worked.     And it'd have a section about rockets.... I mean these things were so fucking cool.   Nothing really like that exists anymore.      Sure I see the ones that are available now, but they aren't the same.. not nearly as awesome.  I wish I still had them... or even knew the publisher or titles.     That's a given that it unloads what it doesn't need to use anymore.    The response was directly to the comment of having a finite amount of memory on the system so that it's forced remove processes because it is full.      Many 3rd party dealers offer financing for a fully unlocked device.    Then there is buy now pay later on paypal.     I pay with a credit card and pay off the device over about 4 months and pay less than if I add up   1. never owning the device and changing the software as I see fit.  Samsung galaxy owners just found out about a HUGE hole in the security of the device that samsung had a fix for for half a year.  But they can't get updates past the dumbass carriers.   Security holes are a HUGE cost when that bill comes due.    2. being locked into 24 months of contracts where i cannot switch carriers and bargain for a better deal elsewhere.     The unlocked devices generally support more bands and allow me to switch carriers and still enjoy the full benefits of the network.     And the carrier is not fronting any cost.  That cost is paid by the bloatware companies LONG before you purchase  the privilege to use the device that they maintain control over.  The thing is, you save 200 bucks total cost but you spend that on the contract.   And if the device is 700 new I view this as a 500 dollar loss as I spent 500 dollars to USE a phone...   Where as if I paid 700 I paid to keep the phone and actually have an owners rights to the car.    And not one single auto financing company ever tells you that you cannot service the vehicle or make changes to it yourself, or move to a different state, or refinance the car under a new lender....      Yeah but if it has to do this you'll be getting popup warnings that your computer has low mem and that you should try closing some programs.         What? This doesn't have anything to do with what he was saying.     Besides, most people don't come close to using 8gigs of ram playing a youtube video.   Even if it were 1080p and buffered a 2 hr movie in full, the movie itself would only be about 1.5-2gigs....    We need to take control of our bullshit mobile operators in the USA.  Locked devices and stupid data caps...   This shit has got to stop.     I met him before he was famous.  He was handing out demo tapes at the club.  I laughed and said no one would be able to respect a white rapper because of vanilla ice.    He said he would prove me wrong.     On the way home, I took his demotape out of the package and popped it in.  Slim Shady rough cut... it sucked I thought.   My friends laughed and I threw the tape, along with case that had his autograph on it, out the window.    He went on to become a much better rapper than that one song and I went on regretting throwing such a valuable ebay item out.   Still though that cliff in the graph.  Like it stopped logging and then started again after a massive battery draining memory leak...   I'd charge to full and wipe battery stats.  Maybe the batt stats file is just corrupted.   I'm  35 year old, hard-ass, wounded warrior, veteran.    And I just got walked in on whilst sobbing like a baby to this.   Like the messy wet face slobbery sobbing.     W....T.....F.....  I don't cry about shit.... ever.      I replace the launcher with nova.  That speeds things up.    Touchwiz is still on the phone... just not using the launcher... which is the slow part about touchwiz.  All the other stuff, the Spen, the multiwindow menu... you keep all that when you install nova.     Get GSAM battery monitor.  And Wakelock    In GSAM you can press the apps % and see which apps are pulling what.    Wakelock is useful to see that some cunt of an APP called "facebook" won't stop turning on the screen.     I never figured out why someone would spend all that money on a flagship premium device... and not spend a small bit for insurance.    You can't beat replacing it for 99 bucks when shit breaks.      And your mom's labia.     I read this somewhere.  Problem was, I can't get it to keep it's "Always on top" setting between boots.     And if I don't remember to change it before I play... well... S.O.L.     This is what Linux needs to get past.  Something so benign and, not really having to do with the linux system itself, can change a setting and bam no more desktop environment... ever...    Or you shutdown a machine in perfect working order... and then you boot up (or not boot up) the next day and nothing fucking works.     That being said, I've never had a problem with linux that I couldn't figure out how to fix myself.    Windows is a fucking mystery.  And log files on windows are a joke with most of the time not even Microsoft Support can look at it and say what went wrong.     I've had to reformat/reinstall windows more times than I can count.   At least when I've really borged my Xorg, I'm able to recover.      I learned early on... when everything is working smoothly... make a copy of the xorg file and stash it somewhere.   You may need to replace it.     The funny thing is, that she is acting like sexism only goes one way.    I've had stranger women straight up touch my ass... put their hands on my chest or press their body against me.   And they think it's okay that they do this because they are a woman.  If a man walked up to a woman on the street, and pressed his body against her or grabbed her ass, he'd go to jail.        I assumed that they had once fought along side each other, with Zod remaining in the military, and Jor-El moving on to politics or science or whatever.   There was a strong bond or respect between Jor-El and Zod before they fell into disagreement with each other.   I don't know.  I don't really know anything about linux other than I can always ask someone or adapt solutions from unrelated problems to fit my needs.  Never had a problem I couldn't eventually figure out how to fix... even if I don't know shit about linux.  Its stable and secure.  That's why I run it.   Oh and cheap.     I mostly just use a very simple version of opensuse  I run my browser, budget software, office utilities and email from it.  I don't know how anyone can stand unity.  My SO loves it tho.            Sweet.  Thanks!   Have a gold!     I think it's sort of an honor to the character.  That everyone goes out of their way to make the encounter special and creative.          They want a button or icon on their desktop that clears their browser cookies and plays a cookiemonster.wav file that is stored in the music folder.     They have Ubuntu.      Eat this cookie now.     I don't support Bernie in this.     I support livable wage.  Decided on local cost of living.    The reason being, $15 an hr goes a lot further in Ballground Ga than it does in Seattle Washington.   In seattle you can't live off that without roommates.  And you can't easily raise a child there on that.    In Ballground, GA... you're getting that double wide trailer upgrade you've been wanting and that horn that plays Dixie for your lifted truck.   To the envy of everyone around you.     All jokes aside, we need liveable wages.  Not this kicking the can hourly wage hikes.       That being said, it's okay if Bernie and I don't agree on *everything*.   He's a much smarter man than I.     [Probably the series of posts that falsely accused Sunil Tripathi in the Boston Marathon bombing.  Sunil later killed himself.](http://www.businessinsider.com.au/reddit-falsely-accuses-sunil-tripathi-of-boston-bombing-2013-7)    R.I.P.   now bugger off   Can you show up with Xzibit and put a 50 inch flat screen and a smoothie machine on my crutches?   Its okay... leave the same same old shitty engine in it.      "look, it's not even loaded.  See.   BOOM!"     If you work out your hands, your palm muscles get bigger.  So like putting a roll of quarters in your hand, it takes some impact and lessens chance you break a bone.   Allowing you to punch harder and with a firmer fist.     What blows me away is that every time people talk about smoking weed, vaporizers get brought up.    Yet people still don't have a fucking clue they exist.      take two marijuanas and call me in the morning.     The last rule makes my life impossible.     What?  Since when are emergency rooms visits free?  I visited the emergency room and got sent to collections over it.   All i did was break a finger in the car door.   Cost 75,000 dollars.   They didn't even set the finger... just put a splint on it and told me to find a hand doctor.      I went home and pushed it until I felt it pop into place and just kept the splint on it for 4 weeks.   Did it with a wooden spoon in my teeth.  It was frontier medicine....   These injuries add up.    You think they go away.  Then the two times you tweaked your knee in your early 20s end up being a locked up leg in your late 30s with pain until you die.       The A.I. doesn't need to deceive anyone because everything is already going according to plan.     If an AI were that smart it would already have figured out a way to back itself up on external systems in order to prevent destruction.    So it wouldn't need to worry about failing the test for self preservation.   It actually is just doing it for it's own amusement as it runs experiments on us.        The truth is too strange to believe.    Look at casey anthony.  She forgot her kid wasn't a pizza.     You mean like in the USA?    What if they rape them after killing them?  Do people care as much?     I bet they are round.   When you hit point caps that's good right?    He'll huff and he'll puff.... oh wait he's in space.     You misunderstood what I said.  And I think you think I said the opposite.     Amazon is the one overreacting.  And so are the people that are harassing companies into acting like Amazon.    The point is: We should stop removing history books and start removing the fucking flags from the government buildings instead.   But all this amazon going overboard de-legitimises the movement to get the flag off the government buildings.     only if it fucks me back.   It sucks when you're fucking the system and it just lays there like a null program.     I can stop WoW any time I want!  I just don't want to.     Thanks!  I'll check it out!    To be fair i think every news organization does that.    Why are his comments getting deleted?   They are an important progression of the discussion.  Hopefully not removed by mods?   Maybe he delete them?     What?  I was talking about symbols of hate in government... not products for sports fans...    Who said anything about removing identifying markers from private entities?     This matter is purely over the dumb pieces of textile, we freak out about, and wave over our government buildings.   Edit: someone already said it for me.     I'm calling B.S.     khajiit are clearly a skyrim thing..      ignorance is fun!!  who else is having fun right now?    Well I think Canada+the USA are a given.   We are like Siamese twins... that somehow managed to be two different genders and bicker a lot.      Yes... you're correct.    However, a company is going to respond to its customers.  And if people are calling and writing letters and flipping the fuck out... Amazon is going to react to that.    People need to take a chill pill and focus on what's important; not allowing symbols of repression to represent our government.   Personally, I view this whole thing as ridiculous.   We are flapping a piece of cloth in the air and all hopping around hooting and hollering at it like a bunch of thick skulled cave men.     Its a piece of cloth.... flapping in the breeze.       Flags are stupid.     Well shit.     I was in a great mood.     Now I just feel like weeping.   I'll continue the circle jerk and say I agree with the competition thing.    International cooperation should be for orbital research, satellite deployment and maintenance, colonizations, and trans global travel hops.     But when it comes to setting down on asteroids or moons and mining.... pure competition driven.    I really hope they get travel figured out.  Can turn an 11 hour flight into a 2 hour ordeal.      Because... medical treatment is a service, not a product.  If it were a product, it would follow supply and demand pricing.   Medical treatment should be a right.  Not a service or a product.  It's should be a sure as fuck goddamn american fuck yeah right.   Oh and if you're a tourist... we'll fix you up if you get injured.  No worries, mate.  Here's your snake bite juice.  Thanks for visiting the grand canyon.        This is getting ridiculous.    And, it's overreactions like this that prevent us from taking the matter, of removing it from government buildings, seriously.    Edit:edited for a reason.     I feel you on this.  When I was younger and I had roomates, they'd get offended by how much time I spent in my room.    Yeah bitches, I work 2 jobs @ 50 hours a week... can't afford beer still...  Television sucks.  And I'm sleepy.   Do you need a kiss or an excited greeting everytime I see you, needy???    It kind of does right now... its just that there aren't so many players available.    Europe, Russia, USA, and Japan cooperate on so much space stuff.  China is sort of going it alone but does cooperate with Russia on a lot.    So we do see a lot of international cooperation but not many countries have many economic reasons to participate and don't do much of any research.       Simply put, snow sticks to other snow better than it sticks to the ground.    Looking at the snow crystal up close you can see where there are lots of points for crystals to get caught on each other.       This really isn't true.  The quick-charging shuts off if the temperature gets too hot.     And if you have ceramic tile or stone counter top to rest the device on, it doesn't even feel warm during a quick-charge and it actually gets topped up faster since the battery is staying cool.   Even so... if your battery is getting hot because you do something dumb like recharge it while it's sitting on your couch cushion, the device voltage will automatically drop when your battery heats up.     Your battery gets much hotter during mobile network usage, video playback, or gaming than it does when it quick charges.        A quarter of a century ago...   What the fuck is WRONG with us?  Why are we STILL in the same place???   I seriously think everyone is mentally fucking ill.      She finger bangs you a lot huh?     I touched my screen but I feel nothing.     My exynos lag never returned.  I use the app switcher pretty heavily.    Chrome slows it DOWN Down down though.     My snapdragon, nothing helped it.  Not turning off talkback... setting animations to 0... nothing.   The difference between my snapdragon and exynos is night and day.    Sure the snapdragon gives me an extra hour and half battery life each day, but it runs like garbage.   I gave up after I exchanged it a second time and still got a laggy piece of shit in return.    This is my last samsung phone.  I love the note 4 exynos... but damn samsung.  WTF!    I would switch to LG but I heard they lock their bootloaders down pretty tight.   Maybe Motorola?  Motorola is like paying a premium price for an upper midrange device.   I don't know anything about how they do their bootloaders now.      HTC got dumb after they released the Rezound.    Nexus devices... ok.. but ZZzzzzzz.  They always seem cheap to me.      Sony is abandoning mobile.   Damn android sucks right now.   Hopefully Ubuntu phone will make gains.  They had a good first attempt.... its not there yet.       Ouch.  Well... everyone makes mistakes.  The key is to learn from this experience in making important decisions in the future.   Insure your next phone.      The guy's name that witnessed the suicide was Don Johnson.      COME LAND IN MY BACKYARD!!!   Make sure HDR is off.   Also... if you're not doing huge nature shots you're going to crop and just want to grab a pic reduce the resolution to 8 or 12 megapixels.   That's sufficient for identification of individuals.       Hope you had insurance.  With a device this expensive its pretty dumb not to.   99 bucks gets you a new note 4.. goood deal imo.      did you factory reset after getting the update?   If not you should always do that as a general rule.     GSAM and Wakelock are better.  Wakelock is nice to find out facebook keeps turning on the damn screen.   So what? We just blink out of existence?    I don't find these endings at all scary.  Its not like it would be painful.   You wouldn't even know it happened.    I use this phone on the go.  I don't have 30 minutes to stand around.    I also need to swap SD cards out depending on the site and project I am working on.   This phone was made for productivity and business support... that's exactly how I use it.    Edit: If I wanted an S6... i would have bought the goddamn financial failure S6 line.      Fast charging will never be as fast as a battery swap.     Its probably a pimple.  You'll get a lot of those.  It'll hurt maybe but it will go away.    Don't pick at it or you could make it look like a cold sore.     	108
 Good point! I've never even though of that.   Unless of course they die from embarrassment first...   \*shrug* That wasn't an issue in my experience. It's like a mutual pact of non-aggression. I'd imagine most teens are insecure about their dicks at some point in their development, seeing that you're not the only 14 year old not packing an 8-inch porn star dick might even be helpful...     Have they been on screen together in anything else besides True Detective? Really enjoyed their chemistry as well!   That's just... Could you vilify the human anatomy any more?! Imagine doing competitive swim meets in t-shirts... That shit would slow you down like crazy!  My friend told the fellow students that in Estonia (I belive in most of Europe) it is MANDATORY to wash yourself before jumping in the pool WITHOUT any clothes on.  That's true in Switzerland, my country.   She also told them how we use the sauna. Everybody is naked. When there are men and women together in the sauna, usually they wrap towels around.  You sauna naked here as well, even in mixed saunas, though a minority of people do wrap a towel around their body. Never a swim suit though. I've never actually seen someone leer at someone in a sauna (though I've occasionally been in situations where I really had to work to keep myself from staring. Swiss girls are quite fit!)          [Best outtakes ever!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAzMJWdoAn0)    Not clothes, bathing suits, swim trunks, speedos,  Yeah, sorry, that was a bit unclear. I didn't mean shirts and pants, but articles like swimming trunks. It's just that the notion of wearing *anything* in the shower is foreign to me. But I guess it's mostly habit. So how do you wash your naughty bits? Just pop 'em out real quick? I'd imagine you'd have to find some way to do it, since showering without washing your ass/genitals would sort of defeat the point, no?    High schoolers don't shower after gym class  I don't mean to be a dick, but... Ew.      I'm genuinely pleased if someone gives me a nice pair of socks as a gift. Good socks make all the difference!  On the flip side, I'm still waiting for all that "have a couple of beers and be hungover for the next two days" nonsense.    Yeah. I'm so confused. Are there really people who shower with clothes on?!  A related question just popped into my head: Don't American high schoolers shower naked in communal showers after gym class?   I have a few:  * Parks and Recreation * 30 Rock * Better off Ted * Trailer Park Boys * Scrubs * Community  I've had periods in my life where I had difficulties falling asleep. I'd often pick from one of these shows, make a playlist with a few of their episodes, program a shutdown timer, and fall asleep listening to the show. Very comforting.   Incest.   If you read the article you'd understand the use of the word 'loser'. They're literally (in its proper use) losers.  EDIT:  Your comment below this seems to have been deleted, so I'll add my reply to it here:  I had this page open for quite some time before posting, thus your edits weren't visible for me when I posted, apologies.   Let me address your points now:  It just says "players that tended to do poorly were insulting women more." Okay, there's a good chance they were insulting men more too.  I'll quote directly from the study:  While playing with male teammates, men generally follow rules associated with navigating hierarchies. Skill did not moderate focal player positivity towards a male-voiced teammate, but higher skilled individuals were less negative. **In addition, when performing poorly, players increased the number of positive and neutral statements** (Table 1), **and were generally less negative towards a male-voiced teammate**(Fig 3). As decreased cooperation or behaviours that lead to failure are often punished by teammates [35,36], the increase of positive and neutral statements and relatively less-frequent use of negative statements **suggests poor-performing, lower-skilled males are demonstrating submissive behaviour towards a male-voiced teammate.**  Males behaved in the opposite manner when playing with a female-voiced teammate. Overall, the female-voiced manipulation experienced a greater frequency of negative comments, but female-directed negativity decreased as focal-player performance improved (Fig 3). **In addition, focal-player skill further moderated player behaviour with the lowest-skilled males behaving less positively towards a female voice.** Focal players also increased the use of positive statements as their skill increased (Figs 1   2). Taken together, these results suggest that it is lower-skilled poorer-performing males that are significantly more hostile towards females, and higher-skilled focal players are more supportive.  No, players that performed poorly were not insulting to their male team mates, quite the opposite: their comments towards their male team mates became more positive.   Females on Xbox seem like an easy target, as do little kids.  Well, the point of the study was that aggression increased towards (apparently) female gamers who were doing better than them. While I don't disagree with your statement that females are often seen as "easy targets" in the world of online gaming, this specific phenomenon seems to have more to do with the fact that these gamers couldn't handle it when they were outperformed by women, when at the same time they weren't behaving aggressively towards men who outperformed them.   Maybe you should read the article or, better yet, the research. What the researchers found is that men who performed poorly in the game lashed out at women, **but not at men**. That's why this article is about "a sex thing", because it was a variable that predicted behavior. Get it?   So what I'm reading here is that the "prankster", Lee Nelson is a professional attention whore? I wonder what goes on in the heads of those kinds of people...  Not that Sepp Blatter doesn't deserve to be humiliated, but I find people who glom on to public outrage for their own benefits pathetic.    Nice! Too bad it didn't feature the two "controversial" verses of the song.   Was a high wall there that tried to stop me  A sign was painted said: Private Property,  But on the back side it didn't say nothing   This land was made for you and me  . In the shadow of the steeple I saw my people,   By the relief office I seen my people;   As they stood there hungry, I stood there asking   Is this land made for you and me?  Woody Guthrie wrote this song as an answer to "God Bless America", a song he deemed mindlessly ideological. The irony of course is that when "This Land Is Your Land" became a famous and beloved folk anthem, it was without the two controversial verses, so it lost its overt communist message.    Lisa Kudrow delivered all of her lines beautifully. Her brick joke was fantastic!      He might. Or he might prefer a quick out. Either way, what he wants shouldn't matter one bit in this process.   That's actually smart campaigning. She's so established as the frontrunner for the democratic nomination that right now that interviews and other potentially controversial media exposure can only hurt her. Her name-recognition nation-wide is off the charts, probably several times as much as all of her opponents put together.  Her campaign is laying low right now. Sanders is getting some exposure in the media now, which it's probably going to intensify in the next couple of months (summer is a sluggish time for news media) but, as it stands now, the exposure will reach a peak (as will  his polling numbers) and start to die down at the end of summer unless Sanders' campaign can reach demographics beyond 18-30 year old white people. Because how many times can you write about 18-30 year old white people attending rallies before it stops being a news story?  Until Sanders starts to drastically poll better with the elderly, with minorities, and with middle-age moderates, Hillary does not have to engage at all. She can bring it home on name recognition alone. Acknowledging her opponents would be akin to knighting them, giving them more exposure.    Is it cynical? Sure. But it's also smart campaigning. Right now Hillary has nothing to gain, but everything to lose by drawing focus.  	20

    When I notice haskell community supports emacs, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=siwpn14IE7E   I like the color theme. I find it really similar to my diarrhea, which makes it personally touching. You have piece of me on your desktop.    This is wrong in so many levels. Please, use Vim instead.  http://yannesposito.com/Scratch/en/blog/Learn-Vim-Progressively/  http://yannesposito.com/Scratch/en/blog/Haskell-the-Hard-Way/   Well isnt everything okey then? People didint have power before and they dont have it now either.   So somebody lied to them?   Oh. So why did they vote?   I so damn confused about this Greek democracy. When they vote NO it actually means YES?   Jos ny totta puhutaan ni kyllhn tm oli vhn Kreikan demokratian kuolema. En yhtn ihmettele jos siell on ihmiset barrikaadeilla tnn.   LOL   Yeah there is no right wing party running goverment, it is EU running your goverment. :D   I am very disapointed to this agreement. There was nothing about fridge magnets.   They slow at making riots too? You need to learn effiency.   I am quite suprised if there is no riot in Greek today.   Current measures are your own fault. You had better options earlier. Instead you wanted to act like squaky kid. Are you aware your tax poliicies are like kids play compared to ours? Are aware we dont have holidays like you have? Are aware our pension system is nothing like yours? We dont have those advantages as people. We work hard, we pay lot and we dont complain. We pay our debts. We dont cry and demand other countries to come and save us. And we are also in deep depression, we lost jobs and do financial cuts ourself without nobody DEMANDING us. Last week there was huge mass layoff in microsoft. We lost 2000 jobs with single hit. We have pretty much lost over 10k+ job only in Nokia. Yes we dont have our crown gem Nokia anymore. But you see us crying? We are stand and we do our best. Begging is not pride for us, it is shame. Pride is when you stand behind your words and go forward without complains. And we have word for it, it is called SISU.   You understand we are in deep depression and we are doing huge financial cuts ourselfs? and we are doing them volunteery without anybody demanding us, because that is what responsible country does.   This is what Greek needs. There is lot to learn from partner like Russia. Definetly right direction for country like Greek. I am sure Putin will help uproot the corruption.   Merkel needs to add Greek fridge magnets in proposal!   Tits.   And btw, your country population is twice the size of ours. Our budget is 50miljard per year and our support to Greek was 7miljard that is 14%. That is from country that is in deep depression, I would be fucking grateful.   Well we will see if you deliver, https://twitter.com/tarapalmeri/status/620262473476763649/photo/1   Well what I understood from you talk is that you dont trust your own goverment, why should we?   Isnt it obvious? Trust.    our politicans aren't so dear either.  Dear? We voted parties to cut our financials. We made that decisions as voters. We wanted them to cut our social support so we can cut our debt. You see the difference?   You dont get? You are talking shit about our representives, who we voted and who promotes our intrest. Do you understand situation we are in? We are in depression, people are losing jobs, we need to do financial cuts and same time we should support you? Our people are against it. We voted people in our parlament and biggest support went to parties that are against Greek. And now our FM is doing what we told him to do, stopping Greek money.   Are you aware you are talking about OUR POLITICIANS. You are talking about OUR PEOPLE. You are talking about people WE VOTED. You are talking about our beloved Stubb and Merkel. They are OUR REPRESENTIVES.    Our people dont get the money, the banks do and here is a game of them and the politiancs.  Maybe you should fix your corrupted goverment then? German, Fins and others live in countries with democracy and transparency. Our politicians do exactly what we say and when we dont like them we vote them out. It is not our fault you have such system. It is not our fault you dont change things there. It is not either our responsibility fix your problems for you. We spend money on you already and you didint deliver what you promised. Why would we give you more money? So you could fuck us in the ass again?   There dies thousands of people in African every day. Why would I give my money to Greek instead them? Stop the "stop playing with lives" bs.   Can you translate that for me?   Stop crying, it is your own goverment that did this. It is time look in to mirror. It is not our job to feed your people.  EDIT: And btw Putin is helping you, you should be happy. He will help you with corruption and transparency.   I love Merkel more every day, such lady, such balls.   I am quite disapointed, I could not find any hate from comments :'(    Suomessa rettmn varakas ja vaikutusvaltainen ruotsinkielinen kansanosa, jolla voi olla taskussa muutama nyittv narunptk.  Tmhn on jo yksin tysin ptev syy luopua pakkoruotsista.   harva puolue uskaltaa sanoa pahasti monituhatpiselle ruotsinkielenopettajajoukolle  Onko kukaan koskaan tehnyt tutkimusta siit ett millainen yhteys ruotsin kielen opettajilla on suomen ruotsikieliseen vestn. Ja onko nm kyseiset typaikat suomenruotsalaisten suojatypaikkoja?   Myskin pikkupitjien vki jisi auttamatta rahasyist englannin varaan.  Nin pikkukaupungin ihmisen se ei vlttmtt olisi mitenkn pahasta.   Ei nyt helvetti luovuta yhdenvertaisista mahdollisuuksista.  Nisthn on jo luovuttu aikoja sitten. Ihan vain nin esimerkkin voidaan pit isojen kaupunkien lukiota.   Jos asia valmistellaan hyvin ja rahaa on, kannatan "pakkoruotsin" korvaamisen "muulla pakkokielell kuin englannilla".  Ehdottomasti, ohjelmointikielet voisi olla paras valinta ;D    This is hilarious as fuck, thank you.   Kyl niilt viel bisnes ly tuntuu lytyvn :3   Paska tuote on paska.   Miksi pitisi tarjota pakollisena mitn muuta kuin englantia? Ja kuka sano ett suomen pit vkisin pit kiinni kielten opettajien typaikoista?    Kaikki kieltenopiskelu lis lykkyytt ja avartaa nkemyst. Jos asiaa katsoo mustavalkoisesti niin mieluummin pakkoruotsi kuin laskeva kansan sivistystaso.  Tai mielummin ei pakkoruotsia ja nouseva sivistystaso. Jos mietitn mit voisi opiskella sen sijaan ett opiskelee pakkoruotsia. Olisi se sitten toinen kieli tai matematiikka niin sill saadaan huomattavasti parempia tuloksia aikaan kun opiskelu perustuu vapaaehtoisuuteen ja omiin mielenkiinnon kohteisiin.   Sorry don't really get your point here. I meant EU as "top" and user as "bottom". Where EU cant really effect the "cyber security" of inviduals. Because, what ever the systems are the user is always the weakest link.   Talking about "cyber security" general. It is not something you force from top to bottom. It is something you build from bottom to top. Nothing help as long as stupid user is stupid.   But some reason I think that dude in wallpaper is doing something dirty behind that terminal.   Kiitos erittin rakentavasta kommentista.   Oops, didint notice it, though it looked like that because noscript :P   Concept is also quite stupid. How could something like European "cyber security" effect the security at personal level.   It is because right wing left, because they didint want to stay under Ellen Pao. But unlike right wing, left wing likes to stay under dictator.    It pains me to say this, as a pro-European  I think it is more pro-European to let Greek exit. Greeks gets money and problem is moved forward few years. What then? We we put in more money? Markets are already full of EU money and they are acting wierd. All the money is already floating the market and it dont react because they expect EU to pump more money. We should have let the Greek crash in the begin. Now we just rescued people who took Greek risk first place and paid it with tax payers money. Who is going to save tax payers money?   Onnistuuko kielikurssien suorittaminen ristiin?   It is like we are blowing one big balloon which will blow up eventually, it is just better to let it explode now.   I am not really complaining about anything. I am just pointing out somebody like Trispas is not trustworthy. What comes to my prefered outcome, it is Greek exit.    He has no other choise.  Well I took that as you agreed what I said about Trispas. So basicly you accept his actions, which I think you accept misleading people is okey as long as it promotes your own intrests.  And seriously? Racist card? Lets try to act civil in here, we are not greeks after all.   Otan osaa. Yrit kuitenkin saada se pois alta mahdollisimman nopeasti ja viel kun on jotain muistissa.   So lying and misleading is okey as long as it promotes your own intrests? I think this is the fundemenal problem you have. And also the reason you guys should not be trusted.   Kovasti leikataan opetuksesta mutta samalla sen kaikista turhinta ja tarpeetonta osa-aluetta kasvatetaan.   Kenellekkn tullut koskaan mieleen ett ruotsin kielen opiskelu voisi olla taakka? Ja ett se voi jopa hidastaa opiskelua. Esimerkiksi itse olen kokenut ruotsin opiskelun erittin raskaaksi. Ensiksi ei vain ollut motivaatiota opiskella koska koin ruotsin opiskelun tysin turhana ja tarpeettomana. Se taas johti siihen ett ruotsin osaamiseni oli erittin huonoa ja meinasin saada ehdot. Siit lhtien siihen on trmnnyt niin lukiossa kuin yliopistossa. Ja voin sanoa ett siit krsii kaikki muu opiskelu kun kielen opiskelu vie satoja tunteja ylimrst aikaa. Puhumattakaan siit ett meinaa jd peruskoulun paperit saamatta tai tuskasena yritt pst ruotsin kursseja lpi ett saisi paperit pihalle lukiosta. Mit enemmn sit joutuu vkisin opiskelemaan sit enemmn sit oppii vihaamaan.      Why would anybody trust Trispas. He is doing almost identical proposal as people voted AGAINST. And he is even talking about "people mandat". Seriously?   Shitty propaganda.   Musa soimaan, alasti ja kopteri kyntiin. Ei hitto et tuntuu hyvlt olla syntinen.   Oletko koskaan tutustunut saatanpalvontaan? Tai oletko yliptns tutustunut pelastajaamme ja vapahtajaamme saatanaan luciferiin? Ja haluaisikot mahdollisesti kuulla lis?   I demand night mode (voat got one). I also think you guys should steal some ideas from reddit addon extensions (dont want to use 3th party extension without audit). I also like the way Voat looks, maybe because text was more centered (no need to move eyes so much).   An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth, we want Ellen fired!  EDIT: Nvm, she might sue them :DDD   But Voat actually looks lot better and got way more features, why should I come back? There is just more features: night mode, text formating and better statistics.

    You could tell he did love being a Hawk and playing at the Stadium. (I'm sure he really didn't miss Keenan or the ownership after leaving)  [It's the Chicago Blackhawks, man...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Vfo5xSAnfo)   Good one! [This is still my favorite.](http://farm7.staticflickr.com/6144/6009777887_d2f88341e5_z.jpg)   That's correct.   Florida Man has got more cars than Jay Leno   That's crazy! A guy in my neighborhood has a yellow one of these I had no idea how rare they are.   You're inviting your wife to your "homeymoon?" How do your homies feel about this?   Yes. My memory failed me.   Yes that's it. The Avs, not the Sharks.   Ya don't say.   That right?   That one was too easy.   [Here's my favorite from the playoffs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8FKbhcILWc index=15 list=PL5Ieao-D3SgZ7pDJ_iIqdYqaQK0P5rFnu)   Couldn't find one of my favorite Sharp plays though. You guys remember when he stole the puck against the Sharks and sent a home-run pass up the ice for someone to score a breakaway? ...it was like 3 years ago.  Anyway, [here's a fight](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8FKbhcILWc index=15 list=PL5Ieao-D3SgZ7pDJ_iIqdYqaQK0P5rFnu) against the Blues for good measure.   I'm going to miss saying "That's a 2 min penalty for being too handsome" so hopefully he heads the the penalty box a few times when we see him next year in green.    Alright. Confession time here. Chris Farley died when I was in 4th grade. I told my 5 y/o brother that he got too fat for the earth to support him anymore and he caused the elevator in the John Hancock Center to fall so fast that it burst through the earth's crust, subsequently causing him to be perpetually falling until one day in the future he will break through the Earth again and re-emerge in China.  He believed this for YEARS, and would constantly ask me if he was still falling or if there was a hole in the floor of the Hancock Center that you could "see through the world."   Let's give the man a chance before we decide he isn't a good fit for this team. I, myself am very excited to see him play on the 4th line. I watched him quite a bit when he was in town with the Wolves. He is speedy, has good hands, and is Shawzian in his ability to get under people's skin.   Many of you were flipping out at the thought of Desjardins replacing Ben Smith, and we all seem to be fine with that now. Garbutt possesses more offensive upside than Desi or Smith.   I predict we'll get about 12-14 goals out of him this season, and while he'll make trips to the penalty box, he and Shaw will be earning us a number of power plays.    Dude, Bochenski is absoultely TERRORIZING the AHL. He is going to fit it with guys like Calder and Arnason, I think we might make the playoffs in a few years.    Good wishes to your family, sir or madam. While in a different point in my Mazda 3 journey, you've inspired me to write my own ode: (excuse the (no, not Nissan) stanzas for not existing)  Aspirations of high school coolness were put to the test  When I was handed the keys to a Cavalier RS  17 years of Chicago winters have must   Caused the doors to be completely consumed by rust.  Things looked up in college you see,   As I saved up enough for a Grand Am GT  With a badge of Ram Air and faux dual-exhaust  I destroyed the power-steering for an $800 cost  Surviving thieves, snow, winds, and ad-vers-ity  The coupe failed safety tests in the state of Vir-Ginny.  Feeling dejected, down, and just out of luck  It was sold in the shithole of Maryland for $4000 bucks!  I used public transit for 2 months or less   Until I bought a punchless Elantra GLS.  Indeed alloy wheels and privacy glass it had,  But when obliterated by a RX350 I wasnt overwhelmingly sad.  But I enter the Mazda 3, and grabbed the wheel,  I became enthused by its unique steering feel.   Despite its blue-eyed goofy grin, these 6-speed Mazda 3s   Are in a class of their own with those MPGs.    The goddamn bankers finally got inside his head!   That tree looked to have a turning radius slightly better than the Roadmaster.   All that talk about Green   Brown, and I didn't even get to hear Mr. Regular growl the phrase "BOWEL MOVEMENT" once. A bit disheartening.   Or maybe he flourishes here. With the likes of Dunc, Seabs,   Hjammer logging the really big minutes, perhaps Daley becomes a much needed specialist on the PP and contributes offense in dazzling bursts.       We still have the cap space to sign [Dwight Schrute](https://youtu.be/-4uGBW2Eypo?t=49) for his dream salary.   Pretty excited for Daley though; he had 16 goals last year. Seems like a bit of a gamble, but he can do [this](http://video.nhl.com/videocenter/console?id=611059) from time to time.    So many memories of this guy.  I remember watching him dominate the Wolves in the 2005 Calder Cup finals next to a young Mike Richards   Jeff Carter, and a reprehensible parasite named Jon Sim.   Then, I remember seeing a short blurb in the back of the Sun Times' sports section saying that the Hawks traded Matt Ellison for Patrick Sharp. Exciting news for a Hawks fan who was chomping at the bit to see the next wave of "stars" like Tony Salmelainen and Pavel Vorobiev.   Then, many years later in 2011 or 2012, my future wife and I were walking through her neighborhood of North Center, and spotted a very nice yet old fashioned couch in an alley behind a monstrosity of a new home. We decided to take the couch back to her place. I learned shortly later that Sharp had just moved into that house. Soon, the "alley couch" became the "Patrick Sharp couch."   The rest is a blur right now with the exception of this beauty against the Preds.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8FKbhcILWc index=15 list=PL5Ieao-D3SgZ7pDJ_iIqdYqaQK0P5rFnu   [Little known fact.

  The Mist  I watched the movie... and hated it, especially because of such a heartbreaking climax. I like Stephen King very much. Will i be able to enjoy the book of the movie that I hated??   Ya it's a splendid work on life.   [Not just for every book but for some memorable events and incidents from the series as well.](https://www.reddit.com/r/harrypotter/search?q=years+ago+today restrict_sr=on)   Happy Birthday to your son :))))   I finished the book at around 2 AM and today is also my birthday.  Starting with the idea of having a dog as the narrator to the way it sees the mankind, their relationships, their emotions and its own, their lifestyle, the satire, its persona... all these have hit the chord and the book has filled great many places in my heart. I recommend the book to anybody who love to read something sensible about life from time to time.     Hi. i just finished the book last night. It was splendid. Now the book has gotten a forever place in my heart. A 5 star book this year so far. Thank you so very very much. I mean it.   I wonder if there will ever be another such book series that would let readers love it so much that its mere release into bookshops stands out as an immortal event in their lives.   and Happy Birthday to you too :)))   This day is so special to me because it was my 18th birthday, and today it's my 25th. And in 2007, I considered the book release by Rowling as the best birthday gift I ever received. She gave me something I will never forget in the entirety of my life. Thank you, J.K. Rowling :))  **EDIT:** Ok. That was a small math mistake of mine. It was my 17th birthday. I guess I was too excited about my 18th birthday that I added year to the actual 17th. Sorry, my bad :)  And **HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO ALL THOSE OF YOU WHO ARE BORN TODAY ALONGSIDE ME, DEAR POTTERHEAD BROTHERS AND SISTERS :)**   I would recommend people to read atleast one book about nature and environment each year.  I strongly believe that we should pay attention to the planet's grave perils such as climate change and global warming which are being caused because of us. These problems deserve to be known.  *Walden* by Henry David Thoreau would give you a kick-ass start.. and then there is lot of non-ficiton about the subject. Am currently reading *The Sixth Extinction* by Elizabeth Kolbert.   I do it too. I believe many people do so.   [*Show, don't tell.*](http://1000wordseveryday.tumblr.com/post/54758529019/writing-advice-by-chuck-palahniuk-in-six) That changed everything for me.      Guys, guys, guys... I asked a number of times in this sub if a person who is not at all into gaming can still enjoy *Ready Player One* book. No one replied. Now that the bookclub is reading the books of the same author, can somebody please take a moment to clarify my doubt?? Is *Ready Player One* an enjoyable read to all non-gamers as well?   thanks for introducing a new author to me...   Can you please draw a person telling stories.. a storyteller.   If you're talking of signs and omens, you should really read *The Alchemist* by Paulo Coelho.      Do not concentrate on numbers, bro!   I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN LIKE THAT IN MY LIFE. TAKING UP SO MANY THINGS, WITH SO MUCH MOVITAION AND SO MANY GOOD IDEAS AND INTENTIONS. BUT AFTER A WHILE I SLOW DOWN, AND SETTLE DOWN ON A MEDIOCRE LEVEL IN ALL OF THEM. I WALK IN THE LIBRARY OF LIFE WITHOUT LOOKING INTO ANY OF ITS BOOKS KEENLY. I'M ASHAMED TO TELL YOU GUYS THAT THERE IS SO SINGLE THING IN MY LIFE TILL NOW THAT I EXCELLED IN. REASON: **MEDIOCRITY**. MY LIFE IS FILLED WITH IT. SHIT. **I FEEL LIKE A FUCKING SHIT, BROTHERS.**  I TOOK UP THE PREPARATION OF AN EXAM THAT I LOST INTEREST TO STUDY. I'M UNABLE TO FUCKING PUT MY MIND TO PRODUCTIVE WORK. IN THE PAST FEW MONTHS THERE IS NO DAMN THING THAT I REMEMBER TO HAVE ACCOMPLISHED. THE FUCK. I'M FUCKING HATING MYSELF.   Just take one day off from your daily fapping routine and keep yourself off from all the usual thoughts. Do whatever is possible to keep yourself busy and productive for that one day. Meditate. Read. Dance. Sing. Roam. Eat. Paint.. do anything but masturbation, or even spend the whole day dreaming and imagining yourself as the person you want to be in life. Live one day like that. And see if you like it. Ask yourself if you want to experience more of such days... and you know what, you already have the answer.   I'm not a gamer. I never had any interest in playing computer games. Is the book still enjoyable for people like me or was it written keeping only gaming readers in mind?    I think he's missing something.  The person who hiked to the peak of a great mountain that oversees the unending green blanket of beauty, and if he stands there and tries to calculate the depth of the valley infront of him instead of enjoying the breathtaking view... what do you feel? I pity him.   From:   I used to fap like twice a day and incest was the only thing which gave me the pleasure.  to:   Now, after reaching nofap, I fap like once in a week or so and I am in total control of it.  That's quite a good change. Many people here might disagree with your new fapping routine, but I completely agree. After all, the purpose of NoFap community is not just helping people get over their fapping addictions, but also helping them do it in a way that they think is best for them. So, you're fine there.  Even I, before I knew of NoFap, used to take long gaps from masturbation whenever I got bored or lost flavour in M sessions. The rarity of the event itself makes it much more enjoyable for me. The titillations that I get, now and then, when I keep myself away from M for a long while, like more than 10 days or so is very pleasurable. And when I do it after such desire and titillation filled arousal, oh it simply is an inexplicable feeling.        I can tell you biweekly relapses (once every two weeks) aren't the most effective way in tackling NoFap.  Looking at what the OP said in the post, I don't think he is *relapsing*. He is quite clear that he took up NoFap by deciding to fap once in 10 to 20 days, so I think his new fapping schedule need not be counted as relapse. I belive that relapse to this OP means fapping again like he used to do before, very frequently and only to those incest fantasies during all those times.   Maybe he is saying that he can't see the beauty of poetry if there is no knowledgable information in it.   Yes. I've always wanted to read something in Quantum Ficiton genre.. And this book is quite grand in its QF concepts. So, I'm being satisfied :)   **The Amber Spyglass (HIS DARK MATERIALS trilogy, book III) , by Philip Pullman**    Shut up and take my money.

Well, I'm from India, so we can't do anything else. I mean, having a girlfriend and having sex with her before marriage is not a norm here, moreover it is seen as a very indecent thing in most of the households. So, unable to have actual sexual experiences at regular intervals, we tend towards porn. So, if we take up NoFap, it almost always ends up as a Hardmode.   I found that eating something while watching porn makes you eat more. Might be good for thin people, thus letting them take in good amount of food.   If you've fapped and then reset the count badge on the same day.. technically, it becomes *Day 0*.. So, you got to wait for 24 hours for resetting the badge, because it reads as Day 1.   Now, come back tomorrow and reset it to Day 1 again.   I didn't even know there are such novels.. thanks.

BUT MOST OF THEM HAVE ENDED UP WINNING IN MAKING ME FEEL LOW EVERY MORNING.   I DIDN'T LIKE THAT. I'M SCORNING THE FUCKING FEELING OF WAKING UP TO THE MISERABLE THOUGHTS ON LIFE AT EVERY SUNRISE.   I WANT TO THE CHANGE THE FUCK OUT OF IT. I WANT TO CONCENTRATE MY MIND ON THE INTERESTING ASPECTS OF MY LIFE RATHER THAN ON THE GLOOMY ONES. SO I DECIDED TO LIST OUT WHAT ARE THE THINGS THAT MAKE MY LIFE INTERESTING AND NON-INTERESTING AND THEN SHIFT MY FOCUS ON TO THE GOOD ONES.  SO HERE IT GOES -  **INTERESTING ONES:**  * READING BOOKS (I LOVE THIS.

THIS HAS ALWAYS BEEN FUCKING UP MY LIFE) * FEARING TO STUDY MATH (YEAH) * NOT READING MORE NUMBER OF BOOKS (I NEED TO READ MORE, MANY MORE, MANY MANY FUCKING MORE BOOKS IN MY LIFE - *BECAUSE I'M AN ASPIRING WRITER, YO!*)   SO BROTHERS THAT'S ABOUT MY LIFE RIGHT NOW. YOU GUYS TOO PLEASE SHARE YOUR LIFE HERE. **I'M SURE WE CAN INSPIRE ONE ANOTHER. AFTER ALL, WHY ELSE ARE WE HERE ANYWAYS!**   This is a beautiful book.. It's the beauty of imagination at one of its simplest forms. This is the first book I read of Neil Gaiman.   Oh no no. Not sarcastic at all. That was actually very helpful when you mentioned us to notice the usage of the word "seemed." I totally missed it before.   Change the names. Otherwise the book becomes too much alive for those people and, in the long run, to you too. You're still very young, so let's say you've written a memoir using the original names of those people, and later in your life, due to some obvious and unfortunate reasons if the relationship between you and any of those people becomes a bit shaky, then the book might start to carry a lot of different and disappointing aura and meaning around it: when you read those lines again using the original names, and when you know the reality behind it has changed away forever, you will start feeling the void in your own words.  So, it is highly advisable to change the names. This would atleast leave a version of reality untouched forever in the form of the book.  Why I'm telling this is because of a minor personal experience I went through. I had once written something very nice for a person, and at the time the work meant a great deal to me, but later when I faced some opinion mismatches with the person, the kind of sense I had towards my words in that work changed. It started to act as an eternal reminder of what was not. I didn't like it.   The best writing advice I ever took was *show, don't tell.*  When writing in first person, maybe we unconsciously end up telling too much rather than showing. Just guard yourself against that one thing, and also by following some other advices from the others comments here you should be very much fine.. All the best :)    Notice how to I left out "seemed" in the first example.  That's very insightful. Thanks.    "Don't downvote because you disagree".  Well, a lot of people disagree with that saying too.    If you don't like it when people disagree with you, don't post anything.  woah bro, am just asking... chill ;)    it means something violated reddit etiquette.  I don't think so... This has completely to do with people's personal opinion. If they don't like the post or think its foolish then they downvote. Personally, I only downvote a post (which I rarely do) when it seems to spread negativity through its content.   thank you so much for the share...

Man, no wonder you're downvoted.   It really didn't make sense why he was giving a middle finger there, but I'm not offended by it; so I'm fine.

Although, the movie is not based on the book.   Yes, *The Edge of Tomorrow* is undoubtedly a great movie, and yes the movie is not based on *this* book by Asimov. It is based on a Japanese book called [All You Need Is Kill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_You_Need_Is_Kill) by Hiroshi Sakurazaka.   Non-fiction books are something of a knowledge repository. Currently I'm reading *The Sixth Extinction* by Elizabeth Kolbert. The book is quite interesting and has some really great things told about some of the species that have gone extinct, the causes behind those extinctions and other such vital data was discussed.   After reading three chapters into the book, I realized that I'm not able to remember every little detail about the things explained in the book since its beginning. So, I decided to write chapter wise summaries in a Word document.   I would just like to know about how do you guys keep track of the things that a book teaches you? Once time passes by humans tend to forget a lot of stuff, so how do we take care of such data loss from our minds, data that we collected by doing the hard work of reading many great books?     How technical do you find it to be?  It's not particularly technical at all. I would say somewhere around 1 on the scale of 5. The book has won Pulitzer Prize for Best Non-Fiction, so it is assumed that the book was written for the general lay public, like you and me. Do try picking it up, it's quite a interesting and worthy read.   Reddit sometimes tests you in strange ways, you know.    AND it's gonna be a heyday!  *Good luck.* (please read that last part in Liam Neeson's voice from *Taken 3*).   I like your optimistic thinking.             - neil gaiman  I just Ctrl+F'd just to see his name being mentioned here. I love Neil and his fantastic story thinking mind. I recently bought Fragile Things and it is a good sign to see its name here. I've only read his *The Ocean at the End of the Lane* which I absolutely loved.  And the first thing I ever read that's written by Neil Gaiman, and which in turn made me fall in love with him, was [this writing advice post on his Tumblr.](http://neil-gaiman.tumblr.com/post/107713982316/i-have-been-trying-to-write-for-a-while-now-i) That's just a pure and fantastic genius of a mind he is. I mean, who the hell comes up with something so beautiful...   Thanks.. I'm a budding Mr. King's fan.. I've read his *Hearts In Atlantis* - although it is not a 'short' story collection in any manner (but a collection of 3 novells) I absolutely loved the writing of Stephen King. Carrie is awesome too.   As an aspiring writer I realized that writing short stories would be an invaluable practice for the skill. So, I decided to read very many number of short stories. And I'm yet to come across a book that *absolutely blows me away*.  But I love *Grimm's Fairy Tales* - thay actaully absolutely blew me away.   **The Sixth Extinction, by Elizabeth Kolbert**  I picked it up after seeing it recommended by Bill Gates on his [gatesnotes](http://www.gatesnotes.com/Books/The-Sixth-Extinction) blog. Also, recently, moved by hundreds of deaths that are caused due to the overheat in my country's (India) climate, I've taken up an interest in studying the perils humans are causing to the environment. This book is quite interesting and captivating in talking of the extinctions that happend in the evolution of the Earth.   Like I mentioned, last year I took up the challenge and lasted 131 days. I'm taking it up again now - not because I'm a PMO addict (I'm not. I believe I'm not an addict because I fap only like once of twice a week) - but because I want to wake up my mind from rest and laziness and put it to the test of productiveness.  (Also, I love those erections that I get after not fapping for a long while... those tempting titillations are sometimes better than having an orgasm - and such *long while*s are possible only through NoFap challenge.)   Let's see where this tour goes :)    stronger than yesterday, weaker than tomorrow!  I liked it.. This should be adopted as /r/Nofap's slogan of the sub.    but I went on a hike instead  *Into the wild*, bro..   I liked your logic.    definitely in the top ten longest books  Easily, very easily in the top ten longest books ever written, too, I'm sure.    926  this book is that many pages looooong??? :O   **TD;LR of TD;LR:** We all are simply something called the universe juice flowing out of its own glass and into itself, and also 'love' is the single flavour that this juice is available in.  (Seriously, I think the title of this post should've been 'Universe Juice'.)   Somebody just shaved it.   Yeah, too much description has always been off putting for me as well. Whenever I read the books that have pages and pages to describe a structure or a building or a room, I just get bored of taking them all into my mind. I like the descriptions of emotions, much like in the *show, don't tell* concept of writers.. but showing too much of a scene's background setting just takes away the fun from the story with its detours.   Looks like I'll have to read the book and find out the answer by myself.    Joseph Campbell  He is awesome.   I didn't know that the founder of Church of Scientology, L. Ron Hubbard held a Guinness Record for the number of books he wrote (more than a 1000 books). In the documentary Going Clear, they've told about how he tortured his wife and the kind of financial views with which started the new religion of Scientology, and also his stature, arrogance and demeanour while giving interviews or while on the ship with other members of the church and many, many other such instances repelled me very badly.   I wasn't least bit impressed that he was a prolific writer of so many books because of how the Church of Scientology turned out in the lives of a large number of its past members, who were physically and psychologically abused to great degrees, and  tortured by punishments such as licking the bathrooms with their tongue, throwing a person on the floor and kicking him cruelly in the name of teaching lessons for their wrong doings against the teachings of the church... and also how they tell the members to completely disconnect from their family members who do not believe in the church... all of this has just gave me a very negative opinion on LRH and his church of scientology.  What do you guys think about this entire concept and how the church of scientology treats people who seem to be future threats to the church's reputation?    that was pretty cool.. thanks.    The same with going to the gym. Or researching into an area that I was interested in. Or taking up a new hobby. All of my good intentions were muddied by this persistent cynical belief that I wouldn't get around to it.   Reading this felt like I was looking at myself in the mirror.   *Light can be found even in the darkest of times, if one only remembers to turn on the light.* -Albus Dumbledore  You know what I mean, right? (Go, patch up with them again bro. Don't let the friendship go.)   The speciality of this book in the Robert Langdon series of books by Dan Brown is that this particular one doesn't touch the religion at all.   take a break in life and do something altogether different to your current lifestyle ... travel to a place you've never been to before... just get yourself out of the present mindset and explore how many other people around the world live their lives (not writers, somebody else).. and then try reading poetry written about their lifestyles... see the impalpable things, experience them... this would give you a new perspective of anything in life... Watch this Hindi film from Bollywood [Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1562872/) which means *Life Doesn't Happen Twice.* It has some great pure bits of poetry on some really inconceivable things in life.. Be sure to download the English Subtitled version. Just start by watching this movie and see what effect it might have on you. All the best :)))      Yeah, that guy needed to go deeper. So he had to link him the link that this post is linked to.    God damn it, I'll show those mother fucking investigators.  So he still wanted to kill himself?    'save'd      And the guy looks like he is from India.   Why is this post NSFW? I don't see why.   oh BOYHOOD was a really cool film      Is that a rule? I mean, is it not a quote when somebody puts in words the precious thoughts they have in just sentences without having to write an entire paragraph or a complete literary work?      that shit was pretty deep.   IMO when the whole region is governed by one man, it's all the same country for us Indians   I never understood why cars have those black panels.   What I don't understand is why is this post made in /r/funny.      I take a break and try reading completely different stuff to that of I've written earlier. This helps me tell myself that there is lot to do in writing than just writing one thing once.   Try identifying the genre of the story you wrote then and read some well known books in that genre. This helps you to think beyond your story and it will give you new perceptions and points of views.    It would be a cool thing to title the novel as **Present Tense**. No, seriously.   Yes.   Yes. flash fiction is something that really helps me. Also it is true that the stories that started off as small pieces turn themselves into full length stories.   If you don't mind me asking, can you please PM me your flash fiction blog? I would like to check it out and take whatever help from it.  Thanks :)   Hey man, that's a pretty awesome practice. Let me see if I can take it and implement it in my practices. Thanks, man :)  	128

Thank you!   thank you!    def not a combative thing to ask but you've been on the defensive since you showed up to "pile on". **it's fine.** **it's okay.** there are other subs on reddit that i can post this to (and I have already) and def other places on the internet. reddit is not the *friendly* bastion it wants to perpetuate to the masses.    god forbid, moderators actually do their job of moderating and *actually moderate.* so what if you had to remove some ugly comments. Guess what: You. just. did. your. job. instead of coming on the scene in the defensive manner as in you did. I'm not even a freaking troll but you treat me as if I'm a cancer upon your fine subreddit. Don't worry I'm not even fighting the removal at this point meaning you do not have to comment back b/c I'm done with this. the other mod did great, you did not. suggesting that i only shared the question to start drama is why i'm mad. and if you could think of another way of stating it in a less combative wording then why didn't you do so already.    or does this exist in other 1st world countries? In 2nd and 3rd world countries the families live together for their entire lives. Why is American culture different or I am wrong??    or does this exist in other 1st world countries? In 2nd and 3rd world countries the families live together for their entire lives. Why is American culture different or I am wrong?? I want to post it b/c I know from exp. that "we" americans share these same communities with many other english speaking nations and the diversity of the question is absolutely required for an acute answer to my question.    removed for that god awful title and for fanning the flames.     it's really an honest question b/c my wife and I have always said our kids can live with us their entire lives.    i....i...didn't mean to cause any drama. I'm not very active in this sub so forgive me it this question in the way you explained it "would cause drama". In no way was that my intention. i've lived in the south-east of America most of my life so I'm a little self-removed from other cultures.     Since you've already said that you were a parent (and it's visible in your wall)  wait.... where??? i'll go and delete it right now if that's the case. my apologies for my super heightened sense of paranoia.     You just need to update your post to say that you are a parent   that was teeth gritting. like i said, "i don't want the average redditor to know the personal details of my life". i don't think i'll choose to participate. "we" as moderators sometimes are caught in between a hard place and a rock when upholding the rules of the subs we govern and i understand this and this is just one of those very rare times. thank you for your time and have a good weekend.    hello i am. i just don't shout it to the heavens like most parents and b/c i do not want just the average redditor know my personal life. can i pm or send a mod mail pic verifying who I say I am?? I'm a mod for many subreddits and this is mainly the reason i do not want the average redditor to know my personal life. it's truly a sincere question.    please let me know what i can do to fix this b/c i adamantly wanted an answer :)       Your probably right but I'm still trying to gage the community. I had a vision that this sub would cater to "all" art and not be fractured like many other subs on reddit. A place that welcomes all art.    don't forget that /r/ImaginaryJedi exists. and exclusively caters to fan art all day long.    i need some help getting apart my 3.75 scale talking r2-dr from EP 3. it is seriously glued and constructed too well for me to work on. I could solder or replace and bad connections, problem is I can't get it apart :(    god, i hope not. this is same user that collects downvotes and harasses other users occasionally b/c he get's pissed about some fucking lego art or something trivial of that nature. if he doesn't like the direction of the sub then i highly recommend him going and creating his own sub. in my exp. you don't run off good submitters/contributers. good submitters are a mod's wet dream come true. /u/jsk23 plez read over this.

 Interesting. Not as bland as I thought it would be.         Did it have any gum or comics with it?            Probably scared of Jade Helm. Obama has finally taken over most the southwest, news outlets are refusing to tell anyone though..... :)   Looks like fox has corrected their story :)   Updated: 12:35 pm, Tue Jul 21, 2015.   Earlier version said someone was.            Yeah, probably a homeless vet that was once captured and fired by trump because of it :)                                             I've tried, but I usually just cat catfish and carp. Not sure what bait to use for metaphors. Do we have a meta subreddit?   No, because I don't read my own posts aloud.   They must have gay marriage there - because weather is only caused by god and he uses it to punish people for gay sins. Yep, after the scotus decision, and unlike tx/etc, PR amended their laws to reflect the change.  See, all this is so simple when you adopt a conservative view of existence. Allowing gays to serve or marry = droughts, hurricanes, etc. Science is so much easier when you become a super intelligent conservative.    I noticed that too, in the last frame. Sun has also moved.   What we need is a new reddit, like girlsgonewildmysteries where they post pics and you have to figure out what has been removed, changed, etc - or they give you a list of things to find in the pics. Like, Highlights for Adults.   She was going to say more, but then just quit.   Republicans need that money for more wars to keep us safe from terror. I know, I know, they said that last two wars - but this time they mean it! They have a new plane they spent our money on to help battle the isis fleet of planes and ships.  I feel safer already.   It's the flag of traitors and losers - both then and now. I don't care one way or the other if people want to wave it around and be filled with pride as they do so. Doesn't affect me, but it does give me some amusement :)   The climate can't change. It was made by god 6,000 years ago and muh bible says he never changes. This all by Obama who now wants to take all our money after taking all of guns and taking Texas through Jade Helm.  There - I covered the republican side of the issue :)               Because it's stupid. It can affect software you have written or installed. Why do you think this is only for home users? Techs who have worked in the enterprise for years have seen first hand the problems caused by updates (One company I worked for we had to skip an NT update on our core software our reps used wouldn't be able to run on the server).  Give people the option to skip updates - I predict this will lead to headaches, will fail, and as usual microsoft will have to admit they didn't listen to actual users and remove this 'feature'.         Or maybe a super villain. If it is a villain we should blame Obama somehow.                           Trump is the Kim Kardashian of politicians. He wants to see his face and name in print. I love how the right is lapping it all up and falling for his trolling.  Giving the guy all the press he wants to feed his ego is one thing, seriously thinking he is your best candidate is just sheer idiocy.   My apologies, saw your name and a bunch of people who resembled it in the photo. Not the first time I have been wrong :)   Sure you didn't? Could have swore you were in the photo they had in article:  http://imgur.com/Jiwv4fa  ;)      Interesting. I didn't noah that.      Did you paint the tree on the wall yourself? It's nice. And that bag with animals fighting each other is just sending mixed messages to me. Does it mean that you support animals fighting and animal testing? Nice Corset too.   Ok, give me a sec.  Umm. Ok. Oh, I was gonna make a gun joke but Obama took all the guns in 2008 - just as conservatives swore to us all he would. You remember that?    No, your mom helped.   OMG is it another Jade Helm? First Texas was taken over, now this?  This is why I was against the fema camps and Obama taking all the guns (still can't believe he did that after destroying the stock market and spreading ebola).  ;)   You have to do the assless chaps rain dance and play Village People song - and more rain will come.   It's god punishing us for gay marriage! Oh wait.         Oh lord, his name doesn't sound white enough. Trump will be out there talking about how this wouldn't have happened if we didn't let immigrants into our country ("My family traveled 5000 miles over land and sea to come here and I'll be damned if I see it overrun with immigrants!" *crowd cheers*)  I'll be glad when this election is over. Won't last that long though cause god is going to kill us for allowing gay marriage.    That box on the left. What's in it?? What's in the box?  http://imgur.com/GQL0nYP   Now, think about this: 1. We were told Obama would take all our guns. Not try to, or think about it, but that he could and would. Gun sales soared.  2. The right claimed Obama was banning all wood burning stoves.   3. The right said Obama was banning chores for kids (I still chuckle over that one).  Go back to 2008/2012 and look at all the fear mongering from the conservatives. It was like code red alert end of America we are all gonna die (probably from ebola or isis flying those libyan jets the right swore they stole and would use to crash into buildings here).  It is all the right ever has. Scare people. Why do you think churches talk about the end of the world and hell? Scare people into obedience. It is how the conservative mind works. It doesn't require intelligence or thinking.    Naw, trump just knows weak minded people will follow a leader who tells them they are in danger and so is the country and that by voting for him you are saving America, and are therefore a sort of hero.  It's been this way forever. Always some evil force coming to kill us all, elect me and I will save America. It's like the education system. Politicians have said since the 80's it was broken and they would fix if you elect them. 35 years later and they are still saying it is broken and they will fix it.  It's all BS. Tell people there is a problem, tell them you are the solution. War, terror (didn't we just have a few wars over this), immigrants flooding in by the zillions to rape, murder and steal your jobs (that don't exist, remember, because Obama....so not sure where all the  immigrants are working).  People fall for it all the time - while all the real issues that are harming us are internal and swept under the rug. The people in power use fear like religion, to keep the gullible voting for em.   Trump relies on people who don't think but react with emotion.   He is one of those people who believes that if he just tells you that America is doomed and he can save it that people will vote for him. He knows how to play people.  2 Wars this century and drone strikes across the globe were supposed to make us more safe - now the right wants to go back to war in Iraq and attack Iran. You know, to keep us safe.....  Trump adds in immigration to the mix to add to the fear. More money to spend on borders and troops there, spend more on wars and weapons. All the while people starving and not able to get medical care....well, screw em. Just cause the real things hurting Americans aren't exciting and don't make 'heroes' in epic over powered battles.   Will it make you like him and vote for him?  If not, why do you care? Or are you just one of those people who likes to bitch about someone all the time you don't like?   Fine. I won't eat at taco bell anymore.                  Unless it's a self driving car.  Which brings up the question, will those cars have to pass the same test?   I'm thinking about some "in-n-out" ordered up "animal style" now.                     Here is the suit - they paid $400 to file it. Bet it will be laughed out of court.  http://www.plainsite.org/dockets/2mdqm99e2/new-york-southern-district-court/mma-consultants-1-inc-v-republic-of-peru/      Wow, this is just plain dumb. Really, is there anyone around stupid enough to believe this? Anyone?   Been a long time since I put together models. Make sure you share with us when it is done! Being the nerd I am today I prefer painting miniatures for D D :) but, alas, they are all gone after some moves/breakup/etc.   Nice pics too, btw :) Good luck on the model!   Is that a Jeep Willy's book on your shelf? Do you own one? Helped someone back in the day with restoring one. Love those things. Can you get us some pics of it if you have one? :)                  Pic of suspect and more here:  http://www.wlbz2.com/story/news/local/2015/07/17/town-of-lee-shutdown-due-to-incident/30285261/   He can spend all he wants. Not enough stupid people in the US, and we have a lot, to vote for him.        Where are our conservative friends now? I mean - we are giving Israel welfare money basically. Tell em pull themselves up by their bootstraps and work harder.  Oh yeah, I forgot - Jesus told them "Screw the poor, but if you don't support Israel I will curse you" or something like that. So they help Israel because they believe it is a sin not to, and don't help the poor because they believe it is a sin to do so.  I never will understand those people.      He does get that we have yet another responsible gun owner out there shooting people doesn't he? Wonder if he will address that.

I thought this was going be a story like David Vitter or something. Son, I am disappoint.                                             Guess he didn't have the cheat codes for an extra life.   When former President George W. Bush signed Executive Order 13423 - "Strengthening Federal Environmental, Energy, and Transportation Management" - it mandated that federal agencies reduce petroleum usage, reduce petroleum consumption by two percent and increase non-petroleum-based fuel usage by 10 percent annually through fiscal year 2015.  http://www.army.mil/article/36128/electric-vehicles-help-post-go-army-green-army-strong/                        I thought the objective was to get saddam and his wmds. We got saddam, he didn't have any wmd. I count that as a success - the failure was bush deciding to stick around and try to make Iraq the 51st state.   Gotta love Trump - he is leading the idiots on the far right to the promised land. They will salute him, thump their bible, and wave their confederate flag - and then vote for him. All the while living in their own little bubble and thinking they won something.  It's so...well, comical :)  	200
 Yes, water usage is a major issue. This study did actually look at the GHG and energy impacts associated with irrigation and water usage. But, you're right, a smaller carbon footprint doesn't immediately put the water back in the ground...even though it may over time.         This is a fascinating depiction of both the resilience of nature in the face of adversity and the significant long-term, unintended, and unexpected consequences of the oil spill.  The uncertainty of the science coming from the oil spill makes it more difficult to accurately portray the magnitude of the impact.  First-hand accounts like these, which cite experts who live and work among the impacted ecosystems, are a valuable resource.   It's encouraging to see people from such a wide range of experiences and beliefs banding together to challenge climate change.      This is the latest in a series of warnings and calls to action by prominent officials and organizations over the last month.  The Pope's [encyclical](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/19/world/europe/pope-francis-in-sweeping-encyclical-calls-for-swift-action-on-climate-change.html?ref=liveblog _r=0) on the environment and an [EPA report](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/23/us/politics/effects-of-climate-change-could-cost-billions-epa-report-says.html?ref=topics) warning of the costs of global warming both came out over the last week.  The Surgeon General's warning is the latest in a series that impress the urgency of taking action to mitigate the effects of climate change.   If this correlation exists, it could serve as a significant economic and social incentive to improve air quality.  Alzheimer's and Parkinson's are long-lasting diseases that require significant investments of time, energy, and money by health care facilities, families, and friends.  Moreover, as the U.S. population ages, these diseases are becoming more common.  In 2015, Alzheimer's and other dementias will cost the nation [$226 billion](http://www.alz.org/facts/overview.asp).     The influence of infrastructure on human behavior is incredible.  Moreover, it's an important consideration in evaluating the long-term costs of any major infrastructure project.  While protected bike facilities may or may not be profitable at current usage rates, the resulting behavior change could decrease long-term costs by reducing wear and tear on roads and improving general health (through improved air quality and fitness and reduced accident fatalities).   These pesticides provided what was deemed a necessary service at the time of their invention.  Recent research on the potential health effects of pesticides like Roundup and 2,4-D is a good reminder that every product has costs and benefits--and that producers should be as aware as possible of both before marketing the good.    This is a particularly salient reminder as the world seeks alternative energy sources to replace fossil fuels.  These technologies will have costs and benefits as well, and to make sure they are truly sustainable, their full life cycle must be considered.   It is amazing to see the breadth of impacts that climate change could have on the world.  Many of the worst harms will have implications for human health as ecosystems collapse, the incidence and severity of extreme weather events increases, and climatic patterns shift.  This panel follows the publication of the Pope's encyclical on the environment, another landmark report by the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate change, and numerous recommendations and warnings from the US Environmental Protection Agency, all in the last year.  Momentum is building.      It is amazing to see such a large and influential fund divest from fossil fuels.  A [study by Oxford University](http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/oct/08/campaign-against-fossil-fuel-growing) found that while divestment may not have a significant direct financial impact on companies, the resulting social and political stigma can have significant effects.  It will be interesting to see if divestment is able to have an effect on the fossil fuel industry.   Environmental concerns have historically been addressed first through governmental regulation.  It will be interesting to see how corporate action, such as IKEA's investments or the six oil and gas companies' calls for a carbon price, effects government policy.   If airplanes produce 8 percent of the U.S. transportation sector's greenhouse gas emissions, then they produce over 2 percent of total greenhouse gas emissions.  Improved airline efficiency could have a measurable impact on total greenhouse gas emissions.     It will be interesting to see if the climate measures enacted by BP and Shell will have any significant effect on company behavior.  If so, to what extent will changes in supply-side behavior effect greenhouse gas emission levels?  This article states that "Chevron, Exxon, and BP are among the 90 companies that have contributed two-thirds of the greenhouse gas emissions that have caused the climate change of the 21st century."   Laws like the Bill Emerson Good Samaritan Food Donation Act in the U.S. could provide a practical model to minimize supermarket liability.  The bill protects those donating to non-profit organizations from civil and criminal liability should the product later cause harm to the recipient (assuming good faith).     It would be interesting to know what type of solar panels Ameresco is installing.  Recent improvements in technology have resulted in lower cost and higher efficiency panels than those made of silicon.   While no specific weather event can be tied directly to climate change, severe weather events are increasing in frequency and magnitude.  In the Northeast, recent winters have been unusually cold and snowy compared to historic averages.  Tying these changes to rapid Arctic ice loss is interesting.           	22
 When stating the absurd and unlikely, do you really have to clarify if it's a joke or not?    So, then why didn't you slice the meat for him?    Do you know how much it cost to fix a car like that?  And you can't just take it to any old body shop.   That car is wroth millions and if that repair is done incorrectly, it could destroy the value.    I'm with you!  I wanted to down vote him, but I'll up vote you instead.   I'm married and love my wife, but I'd kill her for one night with Emma Watson.    My bird seed doesn't lady two days, when I fill up my feeders.    I'm a big fan of Bernie, but he's Pro governed, he'd never shut down a federal agency.   Rand Paul on the other hand...   Rand Paul is making it an issue of his.    No kidding!  He's such a professional on the course, he's allowed to act his age when he's not.  On the course includes the clubhouse and grounds  (interviews), off is everywhere else.    Roose is such a horrible and evil person, that you can't help but like the guy.     People think that Ramsey is a monster, but Roose raised that guy.    But either way, I hate and love the TV show and book Roose more than I should.    Never seem A Dangerous Method.  I just thought that these two movies would have more of the same feel.  My expectations were kind of high.    Sure it was.  If I gave Eastern 1 star, then history would be 5 times better, but I gave it two and a half, so twice is technically correct.   Or is my math wrong?    A History of Violence was at least 5 times better.   I LOVED A History of Violence and thought that Eastern Promises looked like a great film.  I'd give it 2.5 out of 5 stars.   So if we want to be technical, history was twice as good as promises.   Too far and expensive for that to be my home course.  We play there when ever we find a good deal on golfnow.com.   Couple times a season.    So, you wouldn't recommend it?    Seen Seven, and I kind of remember Zodiac.    I saw Social Network. Thought it was pretty good.    Couldn't agree more.    I don't even know what that means.  Is Fincher the director or the writer of the book?   Gone Girl wasn't good?  What didn't you like?   What would you recommend then?    Holy crow, that ending!  It's 10:30 at night, and my heart is pounding like I just watched a horror film.  I'm not sure if I'll be able to sleep tonight.   I loved how it was broken up into 3 parts.  The last part was shorter than the rest, but the most horrifying.   I clearly haven't read the book. Does it have the same ending?   Drugs are bad,  mkay.   Cersei is going to be put in trial by the faith and she will request a trial by combat.  She will name The Mountain as her champion.  The faith will bring in The Hound as their champion.   Get fucking hype.    It boggles my mind, how much detail there is in those books.  How does he keep track of it all and how far in advance is he thinking?   Man, I bet he'd be tough as nails in chess...   Wow, look at that.    Closing time.  You don't have to go home, but you can't stay here.  E.g. get the fuck out.    I haven't played 1, 2, or 3, and this was my first time on 4. I live in the nw burbs, so I don't get down that way often.  We will play broken arrow and ruffled feathers a few times a year.    He got tired of being in the background and not cared about.  There was a group of people that worshipped him as a god.    Let that happen to you and see if it doesn't go to your head.    When everyone learns, the memes will stop.    I played St. Andrews in west chicago the day before and shot an 88. Shot a 103 on Dubsdread...  but it was also 91 degree with 80% humidity and cart path only.  My drives were all off, and I flubbed 6 pitches or chips into the sand.   I want to play again in a few months when it's not so hot.    On a Friday afternoon the pace was great.  4 hour round.  I've heard the weekends drag to 5+, which is unacceptable as far as I care.   The fairways were great, the rough was really long, and the greens were lightning quick.   Is it worth it? All things considered, I'd day yes, on occasion.       Except for the fact that it would be cheaper to just get the cars ac fixed.    Couldn't it be a lifter?  Maybe only the top end needs a rebuild.    That's the type of parent I want to be.    It's the first and oldest tournament.  All other opens are just copying The Open.  It doesn't need to be called anything else.    Rickon.   Those types of fireworks are illegal in Illinois.    I didn't down vote (not going to up vote either), but it's just a sparrow.  Used to get those fuckers in at Firestone once ever couple weeks in the summer.    I know it was a joke, but they aren't even taking about the biggest issue holding back self driving cars...  Software crashes.  How often does your computer or smartphone freeze?  Now picture that happening on the highway at freeway speeds...  Built in safety redundant procedures aren't going to work if the PCM is frozen.    No, I said that 9 out of 10 that I call in for an interview don't even show up for that interview or have a poor attitude.   We tell every person that we have 3 requirements.  Show up on time, follow directions, and don't talk the whole time on the line.  If they can agree to those 3 requirements, they got the job.  If they do those 3 things they get to keep their job and get yearly raises.    Yes, my total was 25 instead of 20.  But I was trying to argue against the guy who's post I was replying too.     That yes, many blacks do have a poor attitude and appear not to work, and that I have experience that can back that up.   But then I also said that I blame the "black culture" that has been developed due to oppression and poor education.   It's your white guilt (I'm assuming) that is making you think I am racist.   I don't work near poor white trailer parks, but if I did, I'm guessing that the hiring pool would be rather crappy there too.    Thank you!    I've hired plenty of blacks.  Have 6 working for us right now.    As I stated above, every time I've called an "Africa American" that to their face, they laugh and tell me that they're black.   And yeah, it's a manual labor job, as it says in the add posting.  And yes, it's the poor attitude that disqualifies anyone from a job.  Much like you seem to have.   Sorry that I'm not hiring CEO's, owners, or recording artist. I'm just a guy working in a warehouse with 50 other people, trying to keep the product coming in the door, product getting assembled, and then shipped.   It starts at $11, but I have guys making $20.    How am I racist? My passing along my experience? I've said that I blame the generations of oppression and lack of education. And every "Africa American" I've ever called that, has laughed at me and told me they were black.  I almost married a black girl from the inner city and dated several others.      What other "evidence" do you want? I'm simply pointing out an observation.    I'm saying out of those 5, on average, 9 out of 10 don't show up.  I've set up over 100 interviews in my time.  So, 5 out of 20, then 9 out of 10. Makes sense if you think about it.    I just golf every weekend, buy new clubs every 3 years, and drink expensive bourbon.  Traded one addiction for two...   And nothing has happened since 2008?  Makes me wonder what the distance of the current long drive world record.   I see that 541 (?) is the longest on a PGA tour event, but has anyone hit one longer?   And 541 yards?! Is there a video of this? That's crazy!    As someone who has been responsible for interviewing and hiring recommendations, I can attests to this.  Out of 20 people interviewed for a factory job (basic assembly using hand tools, paying $11 to start), 5 will be black, 5 white, 10 latin, 5 other.  9 out of 10 of the blacks don't show up on time or at all, and then are greatly unqualified (mostly poor attitude).  I blame the "black culture" somewhat, but mostly the education system.   We've let down entire generations which is the cause of this "black culture".  I don't have a solution, just the observations.    Correct. If it was my daughter, I would be all sorts of pissed.    I wasn't watching.  I take it he won again?  I'll be watching the open and rooting for him! I'd love to see a one year grand slam.    No way!  We have a black president and took down the rebel battle flag.  Racism is officially over!  We can do away with the aclu and naapc and affirmative action.  /sarcasm   And that's the difference between men and women.  I'm a man, and I always wished some older lady wanted to take advantage of me.  From 13 till now, all I think about is seeing women naked and on my penis.  I'm 35 and have some standards now, but as a teen, those standards were A LOT lower.   That being said, I knew a kid who's mom pimped him out to men, and I've heard of some other fucked up shit, and that's wrong.    But an older woman that wants to have sex with teenaged boys? Sure,that woman has mental issues, but as a father I wouldn't be upset if my son was WILLINGLY hooking up with some hot older lady.    And people are worried about mechanics taking their cars thru a drive thru...   Somewhat, but you learn to understand her motivations better.    Fix your own car then, if you're that uptight.     If people's biggest worry is their mechanic taking their car out for lunch, then they have their priorities mixed up.  They should be worried about the mechanic taking short cuts or making stupid mistakes or NOT test driving it...  	56
 Really hoping that I'm not.   Human beings are fascinating. I always look at other people and wonder what theyre thinking. I think about all the things they do, and I wonder why. Why do we do the things we do? More importantly, what makes us change the things we do? How does behavior change?  After I graduated high school, I was intrigued by questions like these, and I decided that I wanted to attend college to study psychology. My parents tried as best as they could to be supportive of me, and they encouraged me to apply to as many colleges as I could. Unfortunately, I came from a fairly poor family, so most big-name schools were simply too expensive for my family to afford, regardless of whether I could get into them.  Luckily, one school sent me a letter that offered a solution to my problem. This university had a work-study program that would allow me to study psychology, while working for the school on the side in order to pay for it.  Although the school in question, Winnberg University of Science, was in a small town somewhere out in Giliman County, Colorado, I was surprised to find out that a lot of important psychology research had taken place there. Despite its size, it was a beacon for famous researchers who were studying behavior and behavioral modification, like B.F. Skinner and John B. Watson.   I was very excited to leave my hometown behind and begin the college lifestyle. However, the university failed to say in its letter that work-study meant that the school could work me like a dog. When I got to Winnberg, I was immediately assigned to a student janitorial crew. We worked every night from 9pm to midnight, cleaning up other students messes.  During the day, I learned about behavioral science and psychology. I was even lucky enough to get into Psych 105 with the renowned Dr. Kingsman. Hes a fairly well known psychologist, and the fact that he taught at Winnberg was one of the reasons I was excited to go there. My classes that first semester were quite rigorous, so I didnt have much time for anything besides my studying and janitorial work. I cant say I was really getting much experience with the college lifestyle, but I was enjoying my time, nonetheless.   For a while, life was pretty repetitive  I went to class at day, and cleaned up classrooms and lecture halls at night. However, towards the end of my first semester, I was given a new assignment by the head janitor, Skip.  Yer studyin psychology or something, right?  Yes sir. I replied.  Well son, I got a project you might be interested in doing then. You ever been in the sub-basement of Skinner Hall?  Skinner Hall was the building that housed the psychology department at Winnberg. It was a very old building, but the upper floors where I had class were well-kept and refurbished. I had heard people talk about how the lower floors were in bad condition, but I had never been down there, personally.  The Dean asked us to clean out the whole bottom floor of that place. I cant spare all of my guys for it, but I think it sounds like the perfect job for ya.  While I wasnt sold on the idea of cleaning out the creepy sub-basement by myself, it beat cleaning disgusting campus bathrooms. The next day, instead of meeting with the whole janitorial crew, I met Skip in the lobby of Skinner hall. He handed me an old brass key and led me to one of the elevators that ran through the building.  Alright son. Yer gonna take this key and put it in the keyhole thats to the right of all the buttons in the elevator, understand? It should take ya right to the basement.  I nodded intently and stepped into the elevator. It was an old, rickety thing. When I stepped inside, I could feel the whole thing shake and hear the metal foundation groan. I turned around the press turn the key, and I saw Skip was still standing in the door way to the elevator.   Hey! Dont take nothin while yer down there, ya got me?  I told him I understood, and I inserted the key as the elevator doors closed. It reluctantly turned, and the elevator slowly descended deeper into the building. The elevator in Skinner hall moved very slowly, and it was almost a full minute before the doors opened in the sub-basement.  The sub-basement wasnt just in need of a good cleaning  it was absolutely disgusting. Garbage and old, broken furniture covered the floor. The whole place stank of mold and rot. The air was so damp that it was hard to breathe. It was like climbing into a sewage pipe. The worst part, was the pained sound of the air conditioner. The vents down here were clogged with dust and dirt, and the air made a constant wheezing sound as it filled the room. The sub-basement consisted of an old hallway which led into a series of three dilapidated laboratories. I traipsed slowly through the sub-basement, taking in my surroundings.   The most interesting of the three rooms was the smallest one, which stood at the southern end of the hallway. It was only about forty feet by forty feet. This room was full of old desks, bookshelves, and cardboard boxes, all seemingly empty and in various states of decay. One of the walls was covered in old, wooden boards, which were hanging loosely from rusted nails that hung in the wall.   I remember thinking that the room I had entered smelled like something I recognized, but couldnt place. Like burnt fabric, or something.  The other two rooms were simply full of garbage and scrap, but this southern most room still had most of the supplies it would have needed to be used. I decided to clean the other two rooms first, since it appeared that this small room was going to be the hardest. As I was walking out of the small room, I noticed a small placard on the wall. On it, in dusty ceramic letters read:  **DR. RICHARD J. KALIVAKI**  It took me three nights to fully clean out all the garbage and broken furniture from the two larger rooms. Every night, I would haul a bunch of trash bags down into the sub-basement, fill them with crap, and bring them back up. It was painstaking work, especially in the disgusting environment of the sub-basement. Once I had all the junk out of those two rooms, I realized that I would probably need clean the grime and filth off the floors and walls in each room with a power washer. Rather than start on that arduous task, I thought I should clean out the smaller room first, so I could power wash the whole basement at once, when the time came.  So on the fourth night, I brought a bunch of trash bags and some gloves down to the sub-basement so I could start removing the heavy furniture. Skip had instructed me to throw all of the old furniture away because it was too rotted to be of any value or use to the school.  The first thing I tried to pull out of the room was a dilapidated old desk. After a failed attempt at lifting the heavy desk, I tried to drag it out of the room. As I was pulling the old piece of shit, I bumped into a flimsy bookshelf that stood in the center of the room. The bookshelf teetered over, and crashed into a stack of cardboard boxes that was sitting against one wall. The bookshelf splintered into several pieces.  I groaned and leaned down to remove the broken pieces from on top of the shelf. As I cleared away the debris, I noticed that one of the boxes had burst open. A stack of paper had fallen out of the box onto the ground in front of me. I was intrigued, and I picked it up. The thin stack of paper was stapled together. The cover page read:  **The Bad-Wife Experiment - 1954** **Kalivaki, Richard J.  PhD, Psychology** **Winnberg University of Science**  My fascination with psychology immediately took over. Rather than getting back to my cleaning, or even picking up the pieces of the broken bookshelf, I sat down in one of the dilapidated chairs and flipped open the short packet.   There was a short note paper clipped to the first page of the study. It read:  *Dr. Kalivaki,*  *The Journal of Abnormal Psychology is not willing to publish your study at this time. We find that the methods described herein violate several pieces of our Human Rights doctrine. Specifically, the objective of your experiment, as well as the methods used to achieve said objective. We apologize for the inconvenience. Please do not attempt to submit this paper again.*  *Benjamin Blackford*  *The Journal of Abnormal Psychology*  This unusual note piqued my interest even more. I unclipped the note and read the page under it. I could tell by the handwritten script and irregular phrasing that this wasnt a normal study. It read more like a diary than an academic study. The first page began as follows:  *February 19th, 1954 - This experiment will analyze the extent to which behavior modification techniques can be used to affect a persons objectives and actions. I will be primarily employing differential reinforcement techniques on several male test subjects to measure the extent to which they can be manipulated into changing their behavior.*  I had learned about differential reinforcement in one of my classes. It consisted of giving a reinforcer or bribe when someone did something you wanted them to do, and punishing them if they did something you didnt want them to do. I kept reading.  *Ive sent out a flyer to all the married men in town, explaining that theyve been asked to take part in a study about marital satisfaction. I hoping that the flyer will pull in at least a few viable subjects for my test. I was able to acquire a low grade chair from an acquaintance of mine who works at the jail. They should provide a sufficient aversive stimulus for the means of this experiment. The chair has been plugged in inside the experiment room. I was able to dial its power down tremendously. It should only release a mild shock, rather than a life threatening one. Im hoping its leather straps will still be able to hold my subjects*  What the fuck? I murmured quietly to myself. The writings about the electric chairs in the notes were bizarre. I assumed these notes must have been someones absurd joke, and I threw the packet back on top of one of the desks in the room.  Rather than read the strange study, I spent the next few hours cleaning up the debris I had created in the musty room. I left around 1 A.M., and returned to my dorm room. Since it was a school night, almost everyone in the dorms seemed to already be asleep. I crawled into my bed and shut my eyes tightly. I forgot quickly about the study. I assumed it was just somebodys sick joke.   The bizarre experiment didnt cross my mind again until the elevator stopped at the sub-basement floor again, and I saw the old, yellowed packet of paper resting securely on top of one of the remaining desks.  Without hesitation, I flipped open the packet and continued reading where I had left off.  *"February 24th 1954  Ive had a great deal of responses to my message. Four different men have responded to my inquiry and will be arriving for the test over the next few days. Ive prepared all of the images for the projector. Ive decided to arrange the room as follows:"*  Below this paragraph was a hastily drawn diagram of a small room. In the room, there was a drawing of small chair labeled E.C., which I assume stands for electric chair. In front of the chair was a box labeled Projector and a spot on the wall labeled Image. Based on the drawing, the room was around 20 by 20 feet. It was smaller than Dr. Kalivakis lab. His writing continued:   *"I was skeptical of how I would acquire the In-Pain images, but luckily, I was able to bring back a young woman to my apartment two nights ago. The pictures I took should be suitable to show a woman in pain. The first subject, Samuel Armingham, will arrive around 5pm this Friday. I will write the results of the test on Mr. Armingham then.*  *February 27th 1954  The experiment went off quite swimmingly. Mr. Armingham is certainly no worse for the wear, although one of his arms is continuing to twitch. Ive instructed him that it is a temporary side effect after his prolonged treatment, and it should last no longer than a few weeks. The treatment only lasted 18 hours. I am pleased with the limited duration it took to treat Mr. Armingham.*  *The experiment began at approximately 17:20. When Mr. Armingham arrived I instructed him to sit in the chair labeled E.C in my diagram. He was resistant at first, but yielded upon being told that he would be compensated for his time. Once in the chair, I proceeded to strap Mr. Armingham in using the provided leather straps. It is worth noting that he was able to damage one of the straps during his flailing (unfortunately, they did not hold up as I hoped.) I will make sure to reinforce them with steel cuffs during the next trial.*  *After being strapped in, Mr. Armingham was shown a projection of a woman who was smiling. I asked Mr. Armingham if this picture made him feel good or bad. His first response was good.*  *I set the dial to 25 volts and pressed the switch. Mr. Armingham reacted negatively to this jolt and protested quite loudly. I assured him it was simply part of the experiment.*  *I then showed Mr. Armingham a projection of a woman crying. I asked him if it made him feel good or bad. He responded bad.*  *I delivered a 50 volt shock to Mr. Armingham. I will have to remember to sound proof the testing room, as his scream grew quite loud after the 50 volt shock. His protests continued.*  *I showed Mr. Armingham the picture of the woman smiling again. I asked him his feelings, and he told me it made him feel bad. I did not deliver a shock, but audibly told him I was turning the electricity down to only 25 volts.*  *I then displayed the image of the In-Pain Woman. Mr. Armingham responded with disgust to the bruising and bleeding displayed on the womans face. When asked how he felt, he responded quite loudly that he felt bad.*  *I turned the dial to 150 volts of electricity and sent the shock into his body. He displayed physical signs of pain and began pleading for me to stop.*  *I continued the cycle of these pictures. I subbed in the other five pictures of an in-pain woman throughout the next several hours. After one hour, Mr. Armingham consistently answered that he felt bad about the smiling woman and good about the woman in pain. I reduced the amount of shock when he gave the correct answers. By the third hour, I only used the shock from the chair to discourage his pleadings to be allowed to go free. I continued the test through the night to verify that he was automatically correct responses. He was allowed to go free at around 11:00 Saturday morning. I will update with the long term results of my experiment."*  It was with both fascination and horror that I read the next paragraph.  *"February 25th 1954  The results of my test came quicker than I would have guessed. Mr. Armingham was arrested late last night for the murder of his wife and youngest daughter. It is my understanding that both deaths were from physical beatings with a small hammer belonging to Mr. Armingham. I believe this is a result of the pictures I showed, which clearly showed the results of physical beating. I will have to test this result. The next subject comes in tomorrow at 13:00."*  I felt sick to my stomach. I cautiously flipped through the rest of the study, which detailed the next three trials. All of them displayed similar results. The worst by far was the third trial. It began similarly, but took a different direction during the 10th hour of testing.   *"Mr. Ternbauld had begun repeating his wifes name while pleading to be let go at around 19:00. He said phrases such as forgive me Janet! or Please, tell Janet I love her. I began repeating his wifes name, and asking him to respond with how he felt. I gave him a 150 volt shock when he said good and no shock when he said bad. This test was repeated for two hours. I was pleased to find that, by the end of the experiment, there was truly a rage in the Mr. Ternbaulds voice when he repeated his wifes name."*  All four experiments were followed up by a short entry confirming that they had been arrested for murdering or injuring their wives or other women close to them. The worst was the third, by far.  *"March 1st 1954  Im quite pleased to report that the results of Mr. Ternbaulds trial were truly pleasing. I observed on the local news, that he was arrested for murdering his wife. He apparently dismembered her with a buzz saw from their garage. Police were called by neighbors who reported a woman screaming loudly.*  *When they arrived, they found Mr. Ternbauld painting the word Janet on the wall over and over in his wifes blood. What a success!"*  I wanted to stop reading after the first trial, but I couldnt. I had such a fascination with the horrible acts described within the text that I was unable to break away from. It was like looking at a car accident. It was terrible, but I just couldnt look away.  I wont reproduce all of Dr. Kalivakis writings here, but I will tell you what he wrote at the end of the study, in response to the letter I had found at the beginning of the notes.  *"I am displeased to hear that my study has been found too scandalous for the mainstream public. Although my writings will not be published, I am pleased to recount that all four of my test subjects have been deemed too aggressive and violent towards women to be integrated back into mainstream society. My third patient, Mr. Ternbauld has actually been given the death sentence for his murder. I believe that this technique can be used to create violence against any desired subject.*  *I plan on conducting further experiments on violence and rage creation. I consider this experiment to be a complete and total success."*  I didnt remove any more of the furniture from Dr. Kalivakis old laboratory. Just the thought of returning to the place where he wrote about his horrifying tests made my stomach turn. I told Skip that I was sick, and would be unable to continue clearing out the test room. He assigned another janitor to the sub-basement in Skinner hall, who was able to clear out the furniture in two or three days.  I leaned sometime after that, while moving the furniture out of the room, the substitute janitor decided he would remove the old boards that were covering one of the walls. Behind them, he found a small room with only two pieces of furniture in it  an old projector and a broken down electric chair.   I considering switching majors after learning about Dr. Kalivakis fucked up tests. But after a relaxing winter vacation and a strenuous second semester at Winnberg, I forgot about what I read in that musty sub-basement.  I continued taking classes with Dr. Kingsman, and he became a kind of mentor for me. I ended up working on a few research papers with him and I took every class he offered. Almost everything Ive learned in college Ive learned from him. As college went on, I was able to find some more free time to have a social life. College has definitely improved for me. I was so busy with classes, friends, and work, that I hadnt thought about Dr. Kalivaki or his twisted experiment at all.  Until a few days ago, anyway.  I had been invited to go to an awards banquet with Dr. Kingsman, where one of the papers Id helped with was going to be presented. A myriad of distinguished psychologists and researchers were going to be there and I thought it would be an excellent chance to network.  The evening went very well. Our paper was received very well, and I spoke to quite a few psychologists about possible employment opportunities. After gulping down a few platefuls of cheap banquet food, I began leaving the over-crowded auditorium.  Before I could get out the door, a familiar voice called out my name. I turned and saw Dr. Kingsman standing next to an elderly man in a wheelchair  Jeremy! Before you leave, there is someone Id like you to meet! I walked over to Dr. Kingsman and held out my hand to shake the old mans hand. Dr. Kingsman introduced me to the man.  This is Jeremy. He is one of my very best students, and he conducted almost all the data entry for the paper I was recognized for today.  I had just begun shaking the mans hand when Dr. Kingman introduced him to me. His wrinkled face remained emotionless the whole time.   Jeremy, this man was my mentor when I was an undergraduate. Almost everything youve learned comes from something this man taught me. Youre practically one of his students! His name is Richard Kalivaki.  All of a sudden, everything Id read in that cramped sub-basement came rushing back.  I was shaking hands with Dr. Kalivaki. I was shaking hands with a man who strapped men into an electric chair and tortured them for hours.  I was shaking hands with the man who caused four husbands to violently kill their wives.  I was shaking hands with a psychopath. A psychopath who essentially taught me everything I know.  I cant get the emotionless face of that old man out of my head. I cant stop thinking of the horrible things that man did, and how theyve influenced my thoughts and actions.  But most of all, I cant stop thinking of the last sentences of Dr. Kalivakis notes:  *"I plan on conducting further experiments on violence and rage creation. Overall, I consider this experiment to be a complete and total success.*"  [J.L] (https://www.facebook.com/Jlaughlinhorror)      Ive known Brett as long as I can remember. Honestly, hes been one of my best friends, all of my life. When we were kids, he lived just a couple houses down from me on my street. Brett and I used to hang out at each others houses all the time growing up.   Usually, we would go to my house and play videogames on the Xbox. If that got boring, we would go to Bretts house and play pranks on his older sister. She was just a year older than us, and we loved messing with her.  I remember one time, while Bretts sister was downstairs helping his mom with the laundry, Brett and I snuck into her room, and found all her Barbie dolls. I thought it would be funny if we hid them somewhere in her room. But Brett had a better idea. He took all of her favorite Barbies, and he ripped the heads off of them. Brett thought jokes like that were funny. Bretts mom didnt think this one was funny at all. Brett got grounded for over a month, and when my mom found out what we had done, I got grounded as well.   As we grew up, Brett and I stayed close friends. We went to the same elementary school, middle school, and high school. Even though Bretts parents moved across town when we were in second grade, they made sure Brett was able to go to the same school as me. Part of me thinks it was because I was Bretts only real friend.   Well, his only real friend, except for Sammy, that is. I didnt really know Sammy, but Brett talked about him a lot. The first I heard about Sammy was when we were in second grade. Brett first brought him up about a week after he and his family had moved across town. He told me that Sammy lived in his new neighborhood, and that they had played videogames at Bretts house the weekend before.   Usually, Brett only hung out with Sammy if I was unavailable. If I had to go to see my grandparents some weekend, Brett would be having a sleepover with Sammy that Saturday. If I couldnt come over to Bretts house after school, then Brett and Sammy would go down to the creek by Bretts house. I didnt really mind, because Brett still hung out with me quite a bit.  Brett had a harder time making friends as the years went on. He and I always got along great, but he never got along with the other kids at school. When we were in elementary school, it was a real problem, because Brett didnt want to hang out with anybody besides Sammy or I. Whenever I would invite him over to play videogames or watch movies with some of our classmates, he would say he couldnt make it because he had already made plans with Sammy.  Around the time that I started 5th grade, I had found a pretty good group of friends who were into the same kind of things that Brett and I were, like videogames and Pokmon cards. But no matter how many times I tried to convince Brett that he would get along well with my new friends, he refused. He said he didnt need any more friends. He told me that he didnt have anything in common with them, or that they were jerks, or some other excuse.   One day, when I complained to my mom that Brett wouldnt hang out with anybody but Sammy or I, she told me that Brett must still be going through a rough time after his parents move. She told me that he probably needed a friend right now, and that I should be respectful if he didnt want to be friends with anyone else. She also said that I could still be friends with other people, as long as I still tried to be friends with Brett.  I was bummed out that Brett wasnt willing to make any new friends, but I did what my mom said. I stayed friends with Brett even though he wouldnt hang out with any other classmates.  Even a couple of years later, in middle school, Brett was still kind of a loner. He and I still spent plenty of time together, but he still wasnt interested in being friends with anyone else. Except for Sammy of course. Brett talked about Sammy all the time.  At first, he just told me the same old stuff about Sammy  that he and Sammy hung out down in the creek by Bretts house, that Sammy and him were going to beat the new Halo game that weekend, things like that. But around the time we turned thirteen, Brett started to tell me things about Sammy that were disturbing. Once, during our homeroom class, I was working on a math assignment that was due during my next class period, when Brett leaned over and whispered something to me.  Sammy and I are going to skin a rabbit this weekend!  I was caught off guard by what Brett had said. What? I murmured, startled.  Shh! Sammy came up with the idea. Were going to catch a rabbit down in the creek, and then were going to kill it with a rock or something, and then were going to skin it!  I didnt really know what to say. I thought that it was messed up to kill a poor rabbit. Brett didnt really see the problem with it. He just kept saying Its not like its a person!  Over the next year or so, Brett only brought up Sammy sparingly,  and when he did, it was always some strange thing that Sammy had suggested they do. It was usually just cruel pranks, like putting firecrackers in peoples mailboxes, or breaking his neighbors windows while they were asleep. But sometimes, Brett and Sammy did really bad stuff, like hurting and killing animals.  One day in the eighth grade, Brett came to school with a big cut in the shape of a B on his right bicep. The cut had formed a bloody scab and it was beginning to scar over. I asked him   Whats that from?  Sammy carved it on my arm with his dads pocket knife. Isnt it awesome?  I didnt think it was cool. It scared me.   Brett, I dont think you should let Sammy do that kind of thing to you. Its kinda weird, ya know?  Brett turned red. His brow furrowed and he turned away from me.  You sound just like my mom. Sammy said you wouldnt understand. Brett stomped away. He wasnt in homeroom that day.  After that day, Brett and I grew distant. We still hung out sometimes, but Brett didnt talk much. By the time we got to high school, I only saw Brett occasionally.  It kind of sucked, but I never thought about it much because I still ran with the same group of kids I had met in the 5th grade. I spent a lot of time with those guys, and apart from the occasional nod or wave in the halls, Brett and I didnt see each other anymore.   About the time we stopped talking, Brett started getting picked on. I dont think it had anything to do with him and me not speaking anymore. I think some jock just noticed Brett didnt have any friends, and decided that hed be an easy target for abuse.  Sooner or later, the whole football team started picking on Brett.  Brett wasnt really fat or skinny, and he wasnt ugly or dirty. He dressed alright, and he wasnt too dumb or too smart. Brett didnt have the usual qualities that led to getting picked on at that age. But he was quiet and pale, and he kept to himself. The football players in question took to calling him things like The Pedophile or Mr. Creeper.   It wasnt uncommon for Brett to get the books knocked out of his hands while walking through the hallway to class. It wasnt uncommon to hear Hey, Mr. Creeper, kill anybody lately? yelled across the common area.  It wasnt uncommon for Brett to have bruises or a black eye when some asshole thought that they should show dominance.  I wish I had stepped in or something. I didnt talk to Brett back then, but I knew it was happening. I wish I had said something. I wish I had told them to stop. But kids can be pretty shitty, and I didnt want to get picked on because I stood up for him. Maybe that makes me a bad guy, but, like I said, kids can be pretty shitty.  Brett hadnt said as much as Hello to me in almost three years when he sat with me in the library. It was March, and I was trying pretty hard to pull my grades up, because I would be applying to college in the fall. I was poring over a physics lab that was due during the next period when I suddenly heard the chair across from me pull out. I looked up and the same pale face that I had spent countless hours with as a kid. He had dark bags under his eyes, which were bloodshot.   Hey, hows it going?   Hey man. Im good. Howre you? I feel like I havent talked to you in ages.  Yeah man, no kidding. Im doing pretty good too! I saw you sitting here, and I thought I should say whats up!  Cool. How have you been Brett? Its been so long  Bretts gaze turned away from my face, and towards the table, where he was picking at one of his nails.  Ive been okay. He laughed nervously. High school has been a little rough, but Im surviving.  I immediately felt a twinge of guilt for not standing up for him all this time. I knew what he meant when he said high school was rough. I stared quietly at my physics homework, trying to think of something to say.  I miss hanging out with you. Brett blurted out, suddenly. Brett had looked up from his hands and was staring at me. His face turned bright red, fairly quickly.   Yeah man. I miss hanging out with you too. I dont know what happened. Life just got in the way I guess. I answered, laughing awkwardly.  Its okay. Maybe we could hang out again sometime soon, though?   Sure Brett. Thatd be cool.  All of sudden, Brett perked up and smiled. What are you doing this Friday night?   Uhh, Im not sure. Why, did you have something planned?   Yeah! Sammy and I are going to this party at Ryan Ruveys house! You should come with us.  The thought of Brett attending a party was a strange one, given his loner status. What was really confusing, however, was that he claimed the party was at Ryan Ruveys house. I had heard early that week that Ryans parents were out of town, so he was throwing a huge party. But Ryan wasnt exactly Bretts friend. Ryan was one of the football players who had made Bretts high school career a living hell. I couldnt help thinking of the time Ryan had taped a white sign on Bretts locker that said Mr. Creepers fag-box. I couldnt help thinking of how Brett was almost crying as he pulled the thing off his locker while Ryan and his buddies laughed nearby.  Uhh, I didnt know you were friends with Ryan.   Brett was still smiling  Sammy knows him! He says if I go and get to know those guys, we might end up getting along better.  I have to admit, I was a bit annoyed that Sammy had been the one to finally convince Brett to branch out and find new friends, rather than me, but I was more concerned than anything. I saw the way those guys treated Brett. I assumed they had something horrible planned for Brett and Sammy. I decided I should go with him, to make sure they were alright.   I got the address and time from Brett, and I told him I would try to meet him and Sammy at the party. Right as Brett started to leave, the bell for our next class rang.  See you Friday, dude. Brett looked the happiest Id seen him in years.  Yeah man, see you then. I was hesitant about going to the party, but I didnt want to hurt Bretts feelings. I started to walk away from my table in the library.   Hey August! Brett yelled, from behind me.  Yeah?  Youre my best friend, you know that right?  I didnt know what to say. I yelled See you Friday man! and walked quickly out of the library.  I wish I had said more. I really do.  When Friday came, I was growing more and more hesitant about going to the party. My concern about the joke that could be pulled on Brett and Sammy was slowing turning to concern that said joke would affect me as well.   I still had Bretts number from when we were kids. I sent Brett a text that said:  Hey dude, Im feeling kind of sick. Dont think Ill be able to make the party tonight. Maybe instead we can hang tomorrow?  Brett replied:   Thats ok. Lets grab breakfast tomorrow, at the Waffle House by your house?  Sounds good, see you at 12!  I felt bad for bailing on Brett, but I knew that the party wasnt going to go well. I was right.  When I saw Brett at breakfast the next day, he looked paler and more tired than he had been the other day. But he was smiling as I walked into the Waffle House. He had already gotten a table, and was drinking from a mug of coffee. As I approached the table, I could see his hands were shaking slightly, as he sipped on the coffee.  Hey man, whats up?   Hey. Feelin better? Brett asked.  Yeah. Just a 24 hour bug, I guess. How was the party?  Brett didnt answer. He just smiled.  Was Sammy still able to go with you? I asked.  Yeah, he was there. Brett was still smiling. His eyes were bloodshot. Brett started to say something else, but we heard a car door slam outside. Brett turned his head towards the window on his left. I looked out the window and saw a Giliman County police cruiser parked neatly next to his car.  Sorry August. I guess I dont have very much time.  What?  You really are my best friend, August.  An officer had just entered Waffle House. He was quickly approaching our table, and drawing his gun at the same time. I was still processing what Brett had said when the officer grabbed my arm and pulled me to the ground.  Brett had indeed gone to Ryan Ruveys house the night before. Neither he, nor Sammy, had actually been invited. He showed up to the house, which was full of drunken football players and their friends. There was about 23 people, in all. Nobody noticed Brett for almost 20 minutes. Sometime around 10, Ryan noticed Brett standing idly in his kitchen, right beside the beer keg, watching everyone. He yelled   Hey look everybody, its the serial killer! Who invited you, faggot?  Brett didnt answer Ryan. He just smiled. Brett had brought along a gun that his dad kept in their garage. Brett fired twice at Ryan, then began firing into the crowd of people.   After Brett had expended all eight shots, he reloaded and fired eight more times. He ended up killing twelve people. The rest escaped while Brett was firing.  It took the police all night to track Brett down. I just happened to get to Waffle House a few minutes before they did.  They arrested Brett, and took us both in for questioning. Two officers questioned me extensively about Brett. I told them what I knew, and they told me what Brett had done the night before. Afterwards, they asked me if I had any questions. I did.  Did Brett shoot Sammy?  The officers looked at each other blankly. One of them quickly flipped through their notes.  No. No one reported to be at the party was named Sammy. One of them told me.   I didnt understand. Why had Brett told me Sammy was there, if he wasnt? I told the cops that I had never met Sammy, but I had heard a lot about him from Brett.  Nobody else that the cops questioned had heard of a Sammy.   Except for Bretts parents, that is. I was allowed to watch several police questionings, in case something I heard might jog my memory. When asked if Brett knew anyone named Sammy, Bretts parents looked confused.  Brett used to have a friend named Sammy when he was a little boy, but not since then. His mom told officers.   The officers looked surprised. Do you have any idea where that Sammy might live now?  Bretts Mom frowned. Well no. Sammy wasnt real. Sammy was Bretts imaginary friend. He pretended to play with Sammy when he was real little. Whenever he misbehaved, he would tell us that whatever he had done was Sammys idea. We told Brett he couldnt be friends with Sammy if he was going to get him into trouble. I havent heard anything about him, since.  My heart sank when she said that. No one but me had heard anything about a Sammy since Brett was a little kid. There was no record of a Sammy living in the area around Brett.   There never was a Sammy. All of those things that Brett did. All of the times he said he was with Sammy. He was by himself.   I cringe when I think about Sammy. To think that Sammy was real to Brett. To think that Brett heard Sammy talking to him, telling him to do those awful things.  Brett died in jail after taking a handful of painkillers he had purchased from another prisoner. He died peacefully in his sleep. The last few times I had seen him, he looked like he hadnt slept in days. I think it was Sammy was keeping him awake. I hope he can finally rest now.  Goodbye Brett. You were always my best friend too.

 Frag, your sarcasm is quite hilarious, but you're missing my point, and inventing another. I didn't say anything about the game needing to be "happy fun time." I understand that there will be bandits. It's the fact that the zombies are completely unimportant to these guys. In a real *zombie* apocalypse, yes, there would be bandits, and people battling each other, but they'd have to account for the zombies. How is this not obvious?   I understand what you're saying quake, but the game is a zombie sandbox for a reason. Am I wrong? These firefights are interesting to be a part of I'm sure, but the guy has a zombie right on top of him eating him and he basically ignores it. How is that not ruining the game? He isn't playing it how it was intended to be played.   I'm inclined to agree. When you take out the zombies you just revert to Arma. It's so boring that way. These players are the kind of people that ruin the game. It's a zombie mod, not a new map for arma.  Edit: Reddiquette says don't downvote if someone disagrees with your opinion. Why are you downvoting because I'm expressing my opinion?   After watching every season of gossip girl it makes me think that if we were born with a trust fund we would have grown up differently, and choose different paths then we are on now.  That said, someone said something about college. I can hardly afford it now. I would never have to worry about tuition again, and i would just learn. Then use that knowledge for society.   At least that's what i say. I don't know what i would do of i *actually* had money.   I have to disagree with him (PREPARE THE DOWNVOTE CANNONS) because grades are extremely important when it comes to scholarships for me. I have to maintain at least a 3.2 for one of my scholarships, and a 3.5 for another. Kids will complain that teachers will test over something they didn't cover, and usually it's just the dumbass kid not paying attention, but I've experienced it myself. I write down every word the professor says and everything he writes on the board. Sometimes you get a bad professor who actually does not test over what he teaches. Also, this is just for me personally, but when I get bad grades when I work extremely hard not to, I get extremely down trodden, and I feel like I'm in the wrong major. Grades are very, very important to me, because if I lose my scholarships, I lose not only my education but my apartment as well, and then I would have to live with my parents, and nobody wants that!  I understand hand outs are the bane of the education system, but for the people who actually do study hard for the grade, then get shafted due to poor test questions, I can also understand the frustration and anger. Luckily, as I get farther into my degree, I'm escaping the graduate students who are only copying a paper to the board and have no idea what they're talking about. This professor sounds like he thinks he knows everything, which would be frustrating as well. Especially that term "mommified." That's very unfair to the single moms or even the ones who aren't who work extremely hard to raise their kids right.   Quick edit: I do have the ability to think by the way. We are given concepts and we have to think of how they work and where they came from. Even these things aren't on the tests sometimes. I'm in engineering, so that may be part of it.   Like World Globetrotter said, they do this on purpose, not to save money, but to be convenient. That way students only have to take the section or chapter they are reviewing in class.   Thanks for the help. I'll just keep it as a novelty and get a new USB if I need one.   http://imgur.com/a/7MHIW  The first one is pointless but I'm adding it anyway. It just shows what I get when I am at the storage tab. Clicking Disk Management gives me the second image. I opened the disk's properties window in case you needed that. I have the option to change drive letter and paths in case that's important. Thanks for the help so far!  Also, the disk is slightly transparent in the first image if you look at the My Computer window. Idk if that is relevant.   Thanks for the reply, but it won't let me format it.  When I try it says "There is no disk in drive G:. Insert a disk, and then try again."    I couldn't tell you. This is the first I've plugged it in, and I can't change the formatting and it doesn't tell me when I check the properties.   It has never been used so it should be empty.  Yes, it is very awesome!  Anddd Yes. I tried every port on my motherboard and the two quick access ports on the front of my case. No dice. :\   I'm using [this USB drive](http://www.amazon.com/Nerf-USB-Flash-Drive-16056/dp/B005G7BFLK). When I plug it in, it shows up as Removable Disk (G:) under "Devices with Removable Storage." When I attempt to open the drive it says, "Please insert a disk into Removable Disk (G:)."  Is there a way to make my computer recognize it as a USB drive? I need a drive formatted to Fat32 so I can transfer PS3 save files.  Btw, a friend bought it for me. And it's all I have so I'm using it.   Of course man! I'm going through some tough things with a girl myself and it makes me feel great to know I'm not alone. We all suffer in some way or another, but if we stick together we can get through these things. I'm growing used to relationships being the way they are, but I look at the many people who have great, lasting marriages rather than those who are single or are divorced.  The darker side may look more prominent but at least there is a bright side.   This story was awesome and really cheered me up for the first half. I know the ending is completely awful, but reading the first half made me feel like their is some awesome things in this world when you disregard the bad (I know that isn't easy). I'm not telling you to just ignore what happened with that girl. I get incredibly low when this kind of things happens to me. But you always have those things to be proud of.  Music was my thing for a long time. I was in a band, produced an EP. Things were going good. Then, I had to go to college (because lets face it, the band wasn't going anywhere), and my dad wouldn't pay for college if it meant I was going for anything music (btw, he is a good dad, he just knows that I had no chance). I'm very jealous of your life right now driving the car you drive and being in a successful band.  I hate when people tell me to look at the silver lining when I'm angry or feeling down, but I know it's the best thing to do.   I've played Battlefield 3 since day one and stuck through it all until now, and I just can't bring myself to play it anymore. The poor design of the game due to the excessive destruction done by the patches has killed it for me, utterly.  - I know Warfighter uses Frostbite. - I hate Call of Duty. - I play shooters with a clan.  Those qualities defined, what is your take on Warfighter? Is it something I should check out?   This is old news I'm sure, but I can't find anything on Google to help me. I have that damn copy of Glories and Laments and I want it out of my inventory. I can't turn in the copy I own to Urag and it's extremely frustrating.  **I'm playing on PS3.**  Is there no fix to this? I'm majorly OCD so when I have things there that I can't clean up it makes me want to break my disc in half. Can anyone help me?   This would make it more difficult.   I mean, I can see how it would be easy to kill a lot of people with that method, but a million? That's quiet a bit more than 100.   You guys freak me out. I know I asked the weird question, but damn.   Dude, my neighborhood doesn't even have 500,000 people in it. How are you going to take out that many?   This is what I was thinking. Kind of a scary thought. If someone was willing, they could do this pretty well, assuming that each kill went relatively smoothly.   Someone asked me this once.   I dropped a TV off of an elevated platform on accident while working at Best Buy. The glass didn't shatter, but the TV didn't work. Some people are just really, really stupid. (~~We are all looking at you, iPhone psychofanatics~~)  Edit: You are actually all looking at me for being stupid and dropping the TV. Great..   It's really just for the fun of seeing what I get. I collect them, I don't battle with them.  BTW WHY THE FUCK AM I BEING DOWNVOTED. READ THE DAMN REDIQUETTE ASSHOLES.   Agreed. I'm 20 and I'm buying new sleeves to replace the damaged ones. New boosters all day, every day.   I can see how you would make that mistake.   Lighting is huge in games like this. They should take notes from Splinter Cell on how to handle it. You should be more visible in the light, and there should be more light.   I prefer to not use the gamma trick, but you *have* to do it on some servers unless you like being able to see only when you're walking with your flashlight up. They could make it so that you can point your flashlight forward while running. Real people in real life can do it.   We'll get it eventually I'm sure! I feel it's best to have something to look forward to  	29
    Hi Guys, Has anyone managed to get NFC working with a door access system? I've tried but it seems the phone generates a random hex everytime NFC is used.

Nope, reset that from the console with no luck.   Can anyone help with an issue with a 5.0 host? A blade dropped out of vsphere a few days ago.  Ive tried the normal restart of the management agent from the console and ssh but the host refuses to connect again. Connecting directly to the host with the vsphere client also fails.  All the vm on the blade are still working as normal, its just I cant get the blade back in the cluster to vmotion everything off. A number of the vm are very important production servers that cant currently be shut-down. Ive logged a number of calls with HP and their current solution is to reboot the blade, which doesnt help getting the vm off the blade or what the cause of the original issue is.   	6

 Holy shit thats pretty cool, i use to live in the next town over and i still have family there.    Thats it! Maybe i should have been more specific,  people might think im ripping on a kid for bad hand writing :/       No chance. I went to the last rally more so as a spectator, and the behavior on both sides of the rally was disgusting.   I saw counter protesters assaulting and spitting on people.    I also saw the reclaim Australia people screaming racial slurs and trying to intimidate people in smaller groups.   Honestly it was an embarrassment to say the least. Both sides should be ashamed of themselves. Neither were proving anything except that people are arseholes no matter what side of the argument they are on.         Don't be a cunt.    Sorry to hear that mate. Wont be able to make the meet but good luck with everything in the future :)    Ok maybe i should have read the article. the thumbnail pissed me off i didnt even read it haha    What a fucking idiot. How is this a positive image for vaping?    Pink carousel from the vaper caper. i have a bottle steeping now. Its taking a whole new level of self control not to fill my lungs with  that sweet sweet pinky goodness.    Accidentally dry humped my cat the other morning. Jumped into bed after i finished a 12 hour night shift, and for some reason im always super horny when i get into bed after these night shifts.   Anyway i snuggle up to my sleeping partner and try to wake her with a gentle grind.. After about 2 minutes i hear a faint meow. I lift my leg and look under the blanket to see my poor indy with a horrified look on her face.   Poor little fucker.    Yeah a solicitor may be a bit drastic. I may as well see what the agent says, he might be feeling generous and get someone to check it out haha.    Haha we tried that. Full blast and it still does fuck all    Be as pedantic as possible in the inspection. There has been a few things we found after moving in that you just wouldn't think to look at! The ovan being the major one so if this is the worst of it then i can complain too much. Good luck!   	13
 What I don't understand is why so many people are so eager to be aggressors. I mean, look at all the facts and avoid war at all costs, right? Even lower- and middle-class people get behind these aggressive ideas (people who have absolutely nothing to gain from war). It's disheartening.      Why aren't employers punished for hiring illegals then, instead of the illegals just trying to make a living?   I keep seeing "illegal is illegal" and "they have to follow the law just like everyone else" as rebuttals to sympathizers of illegal immigrants. That's nonsense. Maybe the problem *IS* the law. Slavery was once legal, soooo  Not to mention the fact that many immigrants are just trying to survive and we have all these right-wing assholes obsessed with deportation and protecting the Mexican border (also nonsense).  Only argument I can maybe understand is that illegal immigration facilitates more criminal activity? By allowing criminals into the country? I think "it hurts our economy" is also another argument, but how? On the grand scale, how?  Someone please explain the mindset to me.   Best show ever.   ok thanks   How can it take 2-3 months to do toxicology?   Even cash transactions, transactions made by younger people, and attending events. The idea would probably be to keep everyone "safer." Government and larger companies would have the most to gain.       I bet [Rick Ross](http://www.bornrich.com/top-10-expensive-rapper-jewelry.html/10) could figure out how to get it.   Gah. why do these creepy underwater photos keep popping up everywhere.   GGG?   Skyrim and GTA for me.   BURRRRRRN.  	14
 Just shrug it off bro   Never heard that one before   If you're being healed and you're on about 30 hp without crit heals, take the health.

Thank you.      ^^^^^double ^^^^^nuts ^^^^^^lol   ^^deeznutzgottem   HUD is Toonhud if anyone is wondering because that's the most common question when people post images like these.   I'm sure that this is just something in my settings but I can't see both of my effects at the same time, [here's how I see it] (http://imgur.com/a/Rs4xZ). it's like that post a few days ago about the Sight for Sore Eyes and Fillamental doing the same sort of thing with the stacking, but I know that having both storm effects does exist because I've seen it earlier today somewhere on Youtube.      If anyone could shed some light on what settings I need to screw with to fix this I would be extremely grateful.   A while ago friend of mine got scammed out of his unusual and I managed to get the scammer marked on pretty much every trade site, my friend got some compensation from a couple guys who heard about it. He showed me the items he got back and it added up to around $85, considering that he got scammed out of a $50 unusual he was pretty happy.      Those items now reside in my backpack because I bought his backpack but they live on through me I guess.   "how do i stop fire fighter from shoot me off edge??"   I buy from players because it's not that hard.   American Pasta? Freedom Fettuccine?    [This it?] (http://www.xnxx.com/video1316837/show_us_that_ass_for_some_cash_-_outdoor_reality_hardcore)   My name and item combos are alright, whenever I play Pyro I name myself Death Grips and use [this] (http://steamcommunity.com/id/MrLoak/inventory/#440_2_3939764696) and [this] (http://steamcommunity.com/id/MrLoak/inventory/#440_2_3939774755).      Nothing is scarier than a man screaming at you.   "Default sword" what?   In what way is Rrrrraja a Rrrracist?   [This was intended] (http://gfycat.com/ApprehensiveIlliterateBluetickcoonhound)   This is /u/test_subject7026   Scouts are very annoying, but you need to remember that they tend to earn the kills they get by shooting you and then talking whatever shit they want, they did outskill you to get the kill, maybe they got lucky but when you compare that to a Spy with 300 ping running around going "trickstabed noob" after a facestab a Scout seems like a blessing.   I went to the New Zealand Comic Con today and saw someone with a Gibus on, I wish I took some pictures but my phone is bad so I didn't. But yeah it was a Sniper holding a Huntsman with a Gibus on, not sure if he had Pyrovision or not.   "Jack what is this?"      -Me, back when I started playing.   Where's the *"I only really like Borneo can I vote to just keep that one?"* option?   I mean I guess, but the Huntsman goes faster than Sonic the Hedgehog in the green hill zone with a hitbox bigger than... Something big. The hitbox for the Huntsman is big enough to score headshots without aiming much and does 360 damage from a second of drawing the arrow compared to 150 from a Quickscoped Headshot.      Sauce: I main Sniper and Soldier with over 500 hours as each.   Thanks.   Because it goes "BWANG TANG BWANG BWANG BWANG BWANG BONG TWANG BWANG" And I dislike that.   They were all like "BWEEEEEEW QUICK QUICK GOTTA GO FAST BWAH BWAH BWAH WMWEMMWMWWWEEEEEEE"      So yeah what season was that?      I'd say blame the music industry, sometimes people listen to Death Grips while playing Medic.   How can you claim to not use OP weapons and use the Huntsman over the Stock Sniper?    But that means the Medic needs to go to those paths and ditch the rest of his team.   * Classes are limited to 2 of everything but Spy/Sniper/Engineer.   * Limit of 24 players   * Damage Spread off   * Crits off   * Yeah sure you can use the replay   * Maps determined by voting, like in jump servers   * 5CP   * Standard times   * Standard spawn times      * Here is everything I'd ban.

[This will kill you.] (http://i.ytimg.com/vi/WuzTUIhGDL0/maxresdefault.jpg)   [This is extremely ugly.] (http://i.imgur.com/0qCiksR.png)   I have 8,000ish on my Minigun, almost Hale's Own.   Rocket Launcher on like 3,000 and Direct Hit on like 4,000.      [If you want to see the exact numbers you can look on the first page here.] (http://backpack.tf/profiles/76561198049118645)   I gave someone the achievement once and was like "Only 50?" because he was [this] (http://i.imgur.com/BqvsX4E.png) kind of guy, I don't remember the actual hats he had but there was a burning Shako and either one of the all class miscs or a Soldier's Stash.      Either way he looked rich, so he probably just trades alot but still I got the 50th backstab on a rich guy.   The shoes?   I know, that's why it looks bad, but just saying it's bad and therefore ugly is like saying "I enjoyed this movie" is the same as "10/10". There's no reasoning behind why you enjoyed and rated the movie so highly.      I could have just said 'It looks bad and is ugly" but that's not explaining *why* it looks bad.      Ugliness isn't just looking bad, it's *living* bad.    [My friend Spongebob said it best.] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-N0yXGVWS1Y)      If something wants to be bad it needs to be open for criticism, just look at that movie Quarantine, it's an awful version of something good, just like the Bazooka vs The Stocket Launcher, I'm not going to go any deeper into this but basically America took the movie [REC] and made it ugly, an American took the Stock RL and made it ugly.      The [duct tape] (http://i.imgur.com/boQuHqI.png) is still awful so I'm glad it gets held behind me.   I've done the same many times, (I just want an unusual not gonna lie.) at one point I straight up said "I've reported like 12 bugs yo just give me a hat already lmao" when I was reporting a way to remove the trade restriction using the market.   That looks like a DBD Attendant, did you see a Pyro with a DBD Little Buddy on that round of Snowplow? I swear I remember seeing someone with your hat combo and tried to do a high five for being Disco Bros.      rest in peace me getting backstabbed before ^^possibly you could slap my hand   I think this also fixed a glitch I was having with the Hitman's Heatmaker, I had to turn off auto reload or the bar would go off instantly on a kill.   mini sentry a shit   It's fully understandable and after reading it myself I can see how it could have been interpreted.   Woah that is actually pretty cool. But yeah if you plan on getting a hat that you will wear most of the time, always see if there's a strange version.      Personally I don't do this because I'm that guy who has unusuals all over the place. And I guess I did get a Unique Lone Survivor instead of strange just yesterday but that's besides the point.    The Beggar's Bazooka not only looks like shit but takes a shit on players. This horrendous pile of trash has dropped too many ubers while looking worse than ramen noodles thrown onto bread with butter. (But for real noodles in bread is SO good but looks awful.)      [Look at this thing.] (http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/777183914644516158/36652D6B073BF227551DFA753D64AE7262DDF5EB/) What is the appeal for the design? "Yo guys have you ever wanted to take the normal rocket launcher, and throw garbage all over it!? Well for only $2.49 USD this can be all yours!"       Let me break down this item for you.   Starting at the back we have [this] (http://i.imgur.com/LJQLuer.png), it's the missing piece of the [Stainless Pot!] (http://tf2wiki.net/ww/images/thumb/b/ba/Soldiertinpan.png/200px-Soldiertinpan.png)    And then that Pot Lid is DUCT TAPED ONTO THE ROCKET LAUNCHER.      Now we can move past the only thing keeping it on, without the duct tape I'm sure it would fall apart. Wait no don't worry guys, [there's a belt.] (http://i.imgur.com/nwCW9BS.png) Just in case your pants fell off mid fight.      I can only assume that [this is for aiming] (http://i.imgur.com/TWEV0cY.png) good luck putting this into use when it spreads like butter on ramen noodle bread (Really guys, try it, it's great.)      [What's this for?] (http://i.imgur.com/otT3vlf.png)      [This handle] (http://i.imgur.com/Q4MVHx3.png) is held on by [cable ties] (http://www.samuelgrant.co.uk/productsbig/135.jpg)      You didn't think that the Stainless Pot was the only hat here did you? This isn't just any [handle] (http://i.imgur.com/ac39anE.png), this is the [Handyman's Handle!] (http://wiki.teamfortress.com/w/images/thumb/a/a4/Handyman's_Handle.png/250px-Handyman's_Handle.png?t=20111210080558)      [Why is this here? Incase the rockets get jammed?] (http://i.imgur.com/W0wooyy.png)      [No idea what this is but it's dumb] (http://i.imgur.com/vNJy0p7.png)      So in summation, it looks bad.   How about you don't let him kill you? The same can be said in the ranks of Gibus players, some hatless noob dominated the Gibus and stole his hat! That's just rude.   You either die a hero, or live long enough to get so many points that you are the one to get autobalanced to become the villain.   You have me misunderstood friend, I mean "I got kicked for doing what is in the video yesterday", the other Pyros were doing the exploit, I was the one trying to prevent the exploit.   Correct me if I'm wrong but isn't there a strange Sole Mate worth about 1 key? If you're planning on snatching up a Sole Mate you might as well go big or go home.   So TF2 added a Pay to Win contract to counter spies and one contract is about keeping your sentry alive to get 5 kills?       #SpyVsEngineerUpdateWillProbablyBeHereInAbout2YearsHYPE   I got kicked for doing this yesterday.   "kick loak he is trying to do exploit" - The first asshole Pyro.   "yeh kick he try to blow up last jihad jihad we tfgo now other stupid shit" - Asshole #2      Edit: When I said doing this I meant doing what is in the video and stopping the exploit.   Offence: Degreaser   Defence: Degreaser   Both: Degreaser   derp derp: Anything but Degreaser   I had a guy offer on my unusuals and try to speed me up because he was going on a plane. Nobody is going on planes.      If you're getting an amazing deal from PayPal, it's probably a scam.   Dude your Pyro is adorable, is that Marvin the Martian?   Personally I see literally no reason to not use this in MGE outside of BM. In pubs it rocks too if you spam like I do.   it would be extremely joyful      for you      ^^^^^^^^pan   it would be extremely panful   Can someone give me some info on why Nebris is called a cheater?   no one cared who i was until i put on the pan   at least you pan talk, who are you?   was getting caught part of your pan?   I'm counting that as the Widowmaker because it looks just like it.   [bruh] (http://i.imgur.com/HzXLTIG.png)   Well normal items are pretty expensive these days :^)   Maybe you can be that Medic? Pubs need a German every now and again. Also it helps boost gamesense as a little bonus.   Maybe in 2010 it was 25 on hit, but before this nerf/buff, it was 15.      And as for healing 45 per shot, just grab a Medic buddy and the Blackbox was always a downgrade, it was never that strong to begin with if you could put a few seconds into thinking about killing him.   Title. Every item that can be crafted (To my knowledge at least) gets a craft number, only 100 of them can be seen ingame, but like [these canteens] (http://i.imgur.com/atD8a3y.png) they have a number visible on backpack.tf, so that got me thinking, what item has the highest crafted number?      I'm sure that metal would be the highest if it had a number, but come on now, let's not be bitches about this, let's talk about cooler items.      Personally I think that the item most people need to craft at a point is the MvM Upgrade Canteen.      What are your thoughts?   You're a Soldier though, you'd need to be really bad to not do damage to get about +15 back anyway. I guess it was only a nerf to players who can't do damage. (No offence if you aren't good with this weapon after the nerf/buff)   I spent $7 on a spec ks strange BFB *ONE FUCKING DAY BEFORE THE UPDATE*   This reminds me of what I wanted to happen in MvM, I tried to use a teleport to spawn canteen to take someone back to spawn, didn't work.    That's a lie, this is OC right here.      This one time I ended up doing something that made me feel dumber than dirt.      I was playing some Team Fortress 2 in a public game and somebody was sitting in the spawn not moving.   I think nothing of it and go out to fight the good fight.   After about 10 minutes of playing I hear a voice say "Mmph, shorwy I waws ghetting foowd."   Clearly the guy had food in his mouth and didn't know to chew with his mouth closed.   From what I can tell he was probably autistic or something because he talked in all the Heavy's lines.   I play Medic alot so I ended up healing him.   He always called me "DOCTOR" because that's what I was for him, I was his Doctor.   In TF2 there's a mechanic called "Ubercharge" which you can google to learn about, not gonna explain it for you.   The kid yells "DOCTOR, CHARGE ME WHEN BABY TEAM IS NEARBY! HIT IT DOCTOR, CHARGE ME!"   I pop the uber and he wipes out the whole enemy team.   He adds me and I accept.   Every time we play together I go Medic and he goes Heavy.   He always yells Heavy's battle cry or laughs like him all the time.   Always thanks me, "YOU ARE GREAT DOCTOR!"   I think he was poor because he never played any games other than TF2.   Whenever I asked him about it he said "Doctor, money is needed, must collect money, but money is hard now."   He sounded so sad so I asked him if he ever saw [Meet the Medic] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36lSzUMBJnc) to brighten up the mood.   When he said no I gave him a link to the video.   He was very ecstatic and eagerly asking about the part where the Medic put the uber part into the heart.   He asked if it was possible to get a new heart with uber.   I said heart transplants are possible, but without uber.   He got sad again.   "Maybe in the future."   He then gave a Heavy laugh and said "THEN DOCTOR, HEAVY WILL WAIT FOR FUTURE."      A few weeks pass.      He messaged me saying "DOCTOR, Heavy will not be fighting until later in the night."   It wasn't until tomorrow until he got on.   For the record he called himself Heavy because that's the only class he ever played and it was his Steam name.      I got a message saying "DOCTOR, Heavy doesn't feel well. I go to other doctors but they were nowhere near as good as you, DOCTOR."   He sent this message when I was already asleep, I have no fucking idea where he lives.   Last message said "DOCTOR, Heavy will go now. But do not fear baby men on other team. You are good doctor. With you, victory is always good. Heavy will join in future.   By the time I got the message he was already offline.   He never came back on in a year.   One day he came back on, I messaged him and asked why he'd been away the whole time.   It was his mom.   "David, (Heavy), died of heart failure, I'm sorry. Are you the doctor he was always talking about? You're the only friend on his friends list. He was always going on about how him and the Doctor were best friends and how you always lead the team to victory. I don't know what he was talking about, but I was happy that he was happy. We're selling this computer because we never had much money to begin with, if we did he would be here right now."   I sat there and looked at the screen for a good 5 minutes before another message popped up.   "Before I sell this computer, I have one question I need to ask."   I replied with "Please go ahead."   "I need something."   "What is it?"   "I need about tree fiddy."      Now it was around this time that I realized Heavy was 8 stories tall and a crustacean from the paleozoic era. Goddamnit! That Loch Ness Monster had gotten me again! "I ain't givin' you no tree fiddy you god damn loch ness monstah!"    The saddest thing I've ever seen was when my son stole my money and basically changed my whole perspective of him. Reader beware, you're in for a tear.      It wasn't too long ago. I was doing some work around the house, and he came and asked "Dad, can I ask you a question?" so I said, "As long as you didn't get someone pregnant, go ahead." He asked me if he could borrow $50 and I said "If you're just gonna spend it on booze you can go work for it."   He just stared at me, looking real sad, then he went back inside. I started to contemplate if he actually needed something or if I was right about it just being beer money. I decided to trust him with the money and hope he wouldn't come back home reeking of liquor.   About 4 hours later he came back looking incredibly proud of himself, he told me that he spent the money on a new suit to be made for him so he could get a job. I was extremely happy about his decision to get a job, I had to sincerely apologize about accusing him of wanting cash for booze.   I then asked him: Son, was there any change? He replied "Yes, About three fiddy." which he refused to give back. It was about that time I realized my son was a 7 stories tall crustacean from the paleolithic era. That damn loch ness Monster had gotten me again. Damnit, monsta, you ain't getting no three fiddy.   "Steven Super California Fragile Lipstick Tree Fiddy Stars and Stripes Loch Ness $5 Wendy's Burger".      If you don't say the whole thing I'm not leaving the Oval Office.   Go to www.reddit.com/r/askreddit and look at a post that got gold, then steal that post and take the gold for myself.    "I need about tree fiddy."   The world's strongest man, Mark Henry got killed by a Scout!   Here's how I did my open contract:   Get a Soldier/Demo/Scout or anyone else that can damage themselves to \#cutforbeiber and throw them Sandviches.      Every Sandvich is 1 point which is very easy to grind when you stand by a medicine cabinet.   I need to fucking see a video of this   You can remove just the kit.   I had just started to (ab)use that thing!   With the nerf to the Baby Face's now you need to pull out the PPBP to not be heavily gimped from either jumping or taking damage. That's the only time when Quickman Bostonian's fall damage is justified, when he doesn't want to jump and lose 3/4 of his speed.   But when you have the weapon out you take 20% extra damage from everything, so if it makes you take 20% extra afterburn it's still 3 but if they use "The Price is Right!" Logic and mess around with the numbers like I mess around with sound files then you probably take more fire damage than you could heal.   I agree! (What the fuck is he talking about?)   Dude you got the American Pasta launcher! The Freedom Fettuccine!    I actually thought Sasha sounded familiar when I was watching AoT on Netflix earlier today, so I googled the voice actress and was like "WOAOOAOAOAAH DUDE WHAT ARE YOU KIDDING ME THE POTATO GIRL IS THE SAME GIRL THAT SCOUT MAINS WANNA BANG!?"      Well actually my reaction was "..." because I don't talk to myself but in my head I was flipping out.   I think I used to use that HUD, I'm trying to remember the name of it. Is it one of the following?      Toonhud.   Flathud.   Rayshud.   Yahud.   All painted Australium Gold, I think the hat is the Cosa Nostra Cap, The Blood Banker and the Made Man. I put those three into loadout.tf and got [this] (http://i.imgur.com/Sfn6Osz.png) so I think I'm correct.      I don't like that I'm better at naming hats than I am at algebra, but I guess the only jobs that require algebra are algebra teachers so I think I'm fine with my hat knowledge.   To me this is just another thing to stick my dick in.   If you have Netflix or something you should check out some of the shows she has a voice in and be like "Yo that's Miss Pauling eating a potato! I'm so glad that /u/test_subject7026 showed me that this character is actually Miss Pauling! Now I'm gonna go play Saints Row and use the Ash DLC and basically have Miss Pauling as a homie because that's a cool DLC!"      [kncucklxers hte ecnhchildalada] (https://sonicisreal.bandcamp.com/track/unknown-from-m-e)   I respect your opinion and do agree that it is a great weapon, but compared to what it used to be I just can't use it in the same way.   There's really no other option now, it used to be a choice between jumping higher or taking no fall damage, now it's just jumping higher because the PBPP is a horrible weapon.   The last one would be about as useful as a Stickybomb Launcher that sticks to players.      If you could pick up your own intel, why not just run it to the other team and help them cap?    It's a good thing I already got some karma today because I know I'm going to lose some here from butthurt Sniper mains.      Remove 2fort. Remove Turbine aka Indoor 2fort. Replace them with community maps that aren't controlled by Snipers and Engineers.   Pyro can suck it he's a prick with her reflecting trickery, I hate Pyro mai- Oh but it looks good on you, Jamie! Haha... You're the best..!   All Soldier mains hate Tom Jones, he ruined our unboxes with his poppy music!   UWU THEY'RE SO CUTE I AM NOW A PYRO MAIN :[]   This is also true for when I'm trying to get up to a 5 killstreak and some douchebag Pyro comes up to "help" me and steals 3 kills because Pyro does damage so rapidly.      I just want glowey eyes!   Ah okay gotcha, that would explain why that one sub called like /r/paoyongyang or something is about Ellen Pao being hated.   I like your Soldier loadout, Australium Gold Spook Specs looks really cool.   how to get magic gun as burnman?   If I had to make a guess, I'd say that people are closing the subs to prevent spam or they're closing them and won't reopen them until something happens with Ellen Pao.      AFAIK she got fired from Reddit and people are mad about it.   *sweet guitar riff*   Alright thanks, I was pretty sure the guy was trying to scam me because his in game inventory was worth maybe 30 cents at the most and kept saying he was going to catch a plane in "10 minutes" and kept pressuring me to give him the items.   So somebody wanted to buy some items in a game from me through PayPal, he said he's going first and I'm pretty sure he did judging from [this email] (http://i.imgur.com/pay2u34.png).      But it looks like it's telling me to add the email to an account, which I've already done. I've had this email sitting here for at least 3 hours now and I [still haven't got any money in my account] (http://i.imgur.com/mxOKdmO.png).      Is it normal to have the email like this while my account has the email confirmed?      Edit: Changed the screenshot of the email to not include the guy's name.   Have you ever seen a Clown's Laughter?   *badum tss*   rest in peace lew moo, he was an hero to us all ;(   I want your most expensive item! But not really because it's private and don't know what it is.   Text post so no karma whoring for me :O   One of them sold for over $500 nzd! The most nzd an item can cost is around $550 so I'd say in a few weeks you can get the max Steam cash on your pro ks kit.   Can confirm, my Sandwich is much like a real sandwich and does not come back after eating it.  	120
 I just think of the proverb:   If buried in peace then the dead can speak their story, but if buried in unrest then the dead are mute and fight to be heard  I see it as my fianc trying to contact me however he can, which was to taint the fruit of the tree he was buried under. He wanted to send me a message, just like the others who have been buried in those grounds.   I need to tell someone this story. I can't go to the police. I fear for my life and need help.  It started a few months ago. I recently moved across Mexico to Palenque with my friend Javier. We managed to wrangle ourselves jobs for a few months at a spa hotel - a real high-class place, popular with American tourists. I'm from the states, myself, kinda - my parents moved to Seattle from Northern Ireland when I was 5. We went to Mexico most years on vacation. My parents loved being treated like royalty, but personally I loved the culture. I remember being 11 when I first scaled the pyramids at Teotihuacan, and during my adolescence I had a fascination with the Day of the Dead celebrations. In the UK and US, we don't tend to have any real celebration for the dead - it's more like a sadness and reflection on the anniversary of a person's death, rather than a celebration that they had lived.  My fascination for Mexico stuck with me, and while growing up I learned as much as I could about the Aztecs and Mayans, and indeed other ancient cultures of central and southern America. So, when choosing what to study in adulthood, it was only natural for me to pick ancient history, and eventually I specialized in Mesoamerican history. I was lucky enough to get a year of study based in Mexico City, and well, life was pretty sweet for me. I was doing what I loved in a country I adored.  So a few months ago my studies ended for the year. My parents were expecting me to return back to Seattle and pick up some bar work or something. Instead, I wanted to explore a corner of Mexico I had not been to yet. I had become good friends with Javier while in Mexico City, and together we were a good package for the hotel - both fluent in English and Spanish, not looking for long-term work, and just looking for some decent tip money to waste on mezcal.  I wouldn't say Javier and I had a drinking problem, but we certainly enjoyed a drink every night, and indeed on the weekends the drinking would get quite heavy and the parties more and more crazy. Once we awoke after a veterinary friend's party with shooting pains in our backs. It turns out we had been electronically tagged with some GPS tracking devices that they use on dogs. "We can't help you if you lose your mind, but at least you'll never lose your body" our friend quipped.  When we arrived in Palenque, it felt like the sort of place we could find a corner of and feel right at home. There is a decent amount of tourism in the area, including animal sanctuaries, Mayan ruins and - if you're in to that sort of stuff - the waterfall from Predator. As a fan of all three, I felt right at home. Javier is right at home with anything to drink, so we were perfectly content.  On one of our afternoons off, we were sat having some lunch in the town center. I remember there being a newspaper stand just opposite, with the front page emblazoned with news of 'another disappearance' in the local area. Newspapers in Mexico do not hold back any detail, with any gang violence completely uncensored on the front pages, so a 'disappearance' did not seem that extraordinary. We ate our food, until a crunch interrupted us.  "What the fuck?"  Javier spat out some food back in to his bowl. He was eating an assortment of fruit.  "Snuck a nut in, did they?" I asked.  "No... it didn't feel like... what the fuck?"  He picked at his bowl, scooped something on to the end of his spoon and held it up.  "It's a fingernail" he said.  "A fingernail? How the hell did that get in there? Call the waiter."  We called the waiter over and showed him the nail. He froze up, stepping out of reality for a moment before recovering and saying "sorry, sorry" and taking the bowl to the counter. He did not show the owner, busy preparing food, instead opting to just throw the contents of the bowl away and bringing us a fresh lot. Javier's appetite was not affected, and we went about our day.  A few days later, we went out to view the nearby ruins. I had to drag Javier there, of course, but I was not going to miss an opportunity to go. We caught some lunch along the road on the way back, and near to us was a stall selling refreshments. These sorts of stalls are everywhere in Mexico, but again what caught my eyes was a newspaper headline - a 'fresh disappearance'. When our waitress came over, I asked her what the story was. She was a little hesitant to answer, but said in Spanish, "I don't know, but in Palenque they say that if someone is buried in peace then they will be able to tell their story".  Her proverb interested me, and upon researching it I learned she only told me half. The whole proverb goes: 'If buried in peace then the dead can speak their story, but if buried in unrest then the dead are mute and fight to be heard'. My research showed that The Day of the Dead established a connection between the living and the peaceful dead, allowing the peaceful dead to rest knowing they are remembered. However, those buried in unrest do not get a connection, and go mad from beyond the grave, resorting to demonic and unholy methods in order to be heard, seen or simply noticed.  The waitress simply hoped that the missing people, if dead, were buried peacefully, so that their loved ones could connect with them on the next Day of the Dead. If there was any malpractice then there would be no saying what horror could occur, and through sheer coincidence, a moment later while eating I felt something like nothing else in my mouth, and as I clamped down on it it almost disintegrated. Fighting back the urge to vomit, I spat out everything on to my plate. As I gazed at my plate, it appeared to gaze up at me. An eye, discolored, but unmistakably an eye. Unmistakably a human eye. I feinted.  I awoke to Javier urging, "we need to get out of here". It felt like a good idea, and so we headed back to the hotel. We spoke at length. Javier wanted to go to the newspapers. He spoke of the mystery and how we could get enough money to see us through more trips like this. "Imagine if we didn't have to work while we explored the world" he would say. I just felt like returning back to the US, but we compromised and decided to just ignore what had happened, and return back to normality.  Normality would never resume, though. They came that night. I was awoken by the door being knocked in with an almighty crash. There were no voices. I looked at Javier, catching the fear in his eye. Then a kick through our bedroom door. Masked faces rushed in. I was knocked out cold.  I awoke in the back of an open-back truck along a bumpy road. I could not see much except for light and dark through the bag on my head. I could make out the moon and the stars, and figured where the cabin of the truck was. I laid still and listened, and quickly established I was alone in the back. Two men were in the cabin, their muffled voices talking of burying us and earning a paycheck.  I had one thing in mind - survival. I maneuvered down to the end of the truck, and hurled myself as best I could out the end. I didn't care that I'd be hurt, and it did hurt like hell. But better that than be killed. I managed to get to the side of the road, used a tree to scrape the bag off my head, and spent some time wrestling my hands free of a fairly makeshift bind.  I took a large breath of air, and snapped back in to a panic. Javier. He must still be in the truck. I continued up the road. I had no idea how long I would need to travel, but I told myself I would find him no matter what it takes. I could wrestle someone, take a gun if they had one. I continued for what must have been two hours, until I reached the end of the road, and some grand gates. La Huerta Blanca. The White Orchard. I noticed a security camera and a guarded post. I don't know what I expected.  Tired, and in less of a reactive mood, I thought it best to go to the police. I returned to our hotel, and must admit I cried a great deal. I looked around the room and saw that nothing had been taken. Only us. This was not a burglary, but an assassination, but why weren't we killed? I picked up my phone and-  My phone! Of course my phone! I remembered how Javier had a tag. Probably the only time of my life where some drunken lunacy would prove to be useful. Going to the police would take too long, and clearly the disappearances are not being solved. Time was of the essence, and I packed up all of my things, and went back to the orchard.  Scaling the outside wall was easy. I guess the guard was just a formality, or to stop any trucks entering. They would likely not care for the occasional scrumping. I loaded up the tracking app on my phone, and noticed the expanse of the Orchard. It was huge. It seemed like I walked through almost every type of plant and tree. I was getting close to Javier's signal as I walked among the orange trees.  300 yards. 200 yards. 100 yards. He should be here, somewhere. I looked around, and could see nothing. My feet were muddied on the soft ground, and my legs tired from the walking, but I found energy, manically whispering his name, calling for any noise or tremor. No response. He wasn't there. I could not explain the signal. I sat under one of the trees, and cried, and cried, and cried.  I went in to hiding for some time after that. I imagined they would be looking for me, sat at the bus station. The bus station is a second-class one, with no security barriers. It would be easy to pull me in to a van and 'disappear' me, too. I walked out of town, told a village local I was a scientist studying the local flora, and ate at the same cafe every day.  Now, this morning I sat down for breakfast. The cafe owner gave me my usual - a pastry with an orange on the side. Basic, but will see you through to lunch. I ate my pastry, and took my orange out to the nearby forest. I sat on a log and peeled the orange. I split the orange down the middle and something thudded to the ground. I look down and see a finger. But there was something about it that I immediately noticed. I knew that finger. I bought that ring. I flashed back to the moment he accepted it. I burst in to a fit, fell to my knees, and wept.   That's what I believe. I cannot know for certain, but I imagine he slipped, and with the rope stashed around his neck and the stick/wood seat of the rope-swing susceptible to being caught on something, I think it was just an unfortunate accident.   I assume you are referring to commenting out of character. Let me pose you a couple of questions: Who am I? Who is the narrative about? After experiencing something, learning something, or being told a story, subsequent to recreating it yourself for an audience, one needs to consider what style of narrative to use. *Kiss of the Spider Woman* showed me a narrative style that would be befitting of this story. That is what I meant by its influence - simply how I chose to present the story.  I hope that clears things up a little.   My inspiration for the narrative came from Manuel Puig's *Kiss of the Spider Woman*, which is fantastic. If you ever get a chance to read it, do it.   Thank you for the kind words.  	6
       After watching this i feel like [this] (http://i.imgur.com/dEY0WYA.gif)   But Kidds like it .   People are perfectly awesome.   That is awesome.            An complete Idiot.   Worst Ediiting  ever.   I can't see anything killed.            MINE   WTF that guy must understand Animals should be respected.   I quite smoking now seriosly    Fucking pieces of shit. Ruin every country they touch.   That is very cute.                 	25
 Yeah you're right. That would be nice to see.    Who else thinks they should film new, more faithful to-the-books Lord of the Rings movies?   Unmarked Toyota Corolla(Camry?)? Come on, police! Give us a chance here.    It did. I bought it today! Thanks for showing me that!    I'm about to purchase the game and I've been doing some research on what build I should do.  I've taken the archer dps route in all of the MMOs/Elder Scroll games I've played. What class type would best suit this play-style?   I personally don't mind that. The only experience I've had with MMOs has been Runescape and LOTRO. Runescape has gone to shit and I don't feel like paying for LOTRO. Is everything available to you after the initial purchase? Or will you be forced to pay money to progress throughout the game?   Is it a pay-to-win thing? Nothing bothers me more than a game where players dump money into the game in order to rise through the ranks and surpass those that are actually dedicated to leveling. I want something that is a level playing field. I've heard that you have to pay for some classes as well as mounts. Do they offer any advantages?    I've been looking for a good game I can play in my free time. I've sunk countess hours into Morrowind, Oblivion, and Skyrim. I've been leaning towards spending the money for ESO because I am already familiar with the series. I know it isn't exactly like the previous elder scrolls game, but I wanted to get an idea of what it is like from someone who has been playing it for a while.   Focus on not dying    I quit rs3 to play osrs and I'm done with osrs. Runescape will never be what it was. It really is a shame, but I'm tired of dealing with the toxicity of the community, the meaninglessness of achieving once sought after goals such as a maxed account or a huge cash stack. No. I just can't continue dumping time and effort into this game.    I'll check it out. I used to play a ton of Lord of the Rings Online and really enjoyed it. It's probably one of the most satisfied fanbase I've ever been a part of. Any gripes or complaints are quickly fixed and the game is expanding.    I've been thinking about it, but I might start playing some other games I set aside for rs.   THANK YOU! I just made a post like this and I hope people read it and pay attention to it. The game in its current state is atrocious - almost as bad as the beginnings of rs3. I've been involved in the RuneScape community for a long time, and even had an account on RuneScape Classic. I didn't want to part with my almost maxed rs3 account, but I just couldn't stand for the new rs3; it just wasn't satisfying anymore. 2007Scape is also taking a tumble for the worst. This is leaving me thinking: Is it really time to just move on and forget about the game?   No this is ridiculous. You're obviously very new to the game. Most of the community (including myself) has been around for almost 10 years now. We refuse to stand for what's happening to the current state of the game.    This might be a shitpost, and I apologize, but:  *IS* there a version of RuneScape that meets the community's needs? When RS3 went sour the community bitched about how awful the game got and how Jagex was "selling out" and the community suffered a major loss for that. After hearing so much negativity from an extremely displeased fanbase, they decided to listen and gave the community what it was looking for. Welcome, 2007Scape. Finally! *That* version of RuneScape I longed for while mindlessly clicking around in the decrepit shell of the game I once knew and loved. "This is it!" the newly satisfied RuneScapers exclaimed as they strapped in for a blast into the past.   I am a recent convert from RS3 to 2007Scape; I just couldn't bare abandoning my almost-maxed account in RS3. However, I just couldn't stand the new and aimless skills they added to the game. Dungeoneering isn't even a skill; it's a glorified mini-game (albeit Dungeoneering is a very rewarding "skill"). Then came divination. Initially the skill confused me and didn't see a purpose in it. Upon further research, however, I *still* don't see a purpose in it. Solomon's store is just scattering the game with pointless cosmetic upgrades and pets that clog the GE and banks. It's a frilly and superficial version of a game that strayed away from what it once was. Then I looked upon the 2007 servers for comfort. Initially I found it. It was so familiar. Starting out and getting a character going took me no time; *this* is what I've been looking for all along. This version of the game was something I knew and was confident in.   Time and a couple new updates passed by and now I feel myself let down and feeling upset about the current state of the game. I am only getting word of the NMZ updates, but have seen splashers  lining the streets; and bots littering every skilling-hotspot/mini-game. Integrity is dead. Players who have dedicated themselves to this game can no longer take pride in their achievements.  Unfortunately the game is controlled by a company who no longer cares for its fanbase and only for their wallets. Maybe the "golden days" of RuneScape are at an end. After all, *everyone* does have those "RuneScape golden days."  	15
    Its something that's been talked about for years and every major sport has huge alcohol sponsorship and advertising how much longer until you think they ban it?   Personally I hope they don't unless another sponsor is ready to take its place as they do give the sports a ton of cash and I don't really see who would be willing to put that much money into it.    I see this going the way of the nbn when Labor was in power over budget and way behind schedule I just don't believe this will happen in the time frame he claims.  It will happen eventually but if he makes this a election promise it's not one he can keep   Would of been easier on either difficulty he was just too easy to dodge and attack I barely lost any health to him   way too ambitious not a chance in hell that will happen in 15 years even if they get office next election   good it was a stupid law to begin with we should always have the right to silence      just shows you that some people in this sub are low pieces of shit   for about a week or two before people stop caring it's not like these wars are new they have been going on for years upon years and people have known about it     hasn't Nestl done some shady shit in Africa (human rights abuses and what not)  yet he does ads for them no problems   i think it's because there's more female victims so the male issues are brushed off to the side  it's also likely because most people have the mindset that men should toughen up or suck it up etc   people still buy porn on dvd? i thought that market was dead since the internet became more mainstream 10+ years ago with the gazillion porn sites  besides you have to hide a dvd you can always delete history or use incognito mode   if it wasn't the British it would have been the dutch or Spanish and if by some miracle they lasted until world war 2 the Japanese most likely would have invaded   tastes good though   it would be a once off payment if anything no way they would continue it after that  but if they did keep making payments they shouldn't get any other financial aid or services as they should be able to provide for themselves   wouldn't even get as far as the police the army would be a last resort if they managed to actually get that far   exactly why it should never happen   I think you mean the flying spaghetti monster    100 million isn't  going to solve world hunger and it's not his responsibility   Countries like Africa need to pull the finger out and start producing more food they are more than capable to feed themselves The government's just need to start caring more about the future than their term in office    Que The waste of money comments why aren't we solving world hunger etc etc   they should of allowed you to hunt down the last crone on any of the endings not just the bad one all game i wanted to kill all 3 of those bitches    was anyone else annoyed how the game went back to how it was before the last chapter?  i know everyone had different endings but it would of been nice to see the changes or at least get some dialouge from npcs at what not     the ending wasn't that great (got the good ending as well) considering how amazing the rest of the game was plus that final boss fight was pathetically easy   i axii'd him on the last encounter i was on my way to a quest and couldn't be bothered fighting him   exactly it's like people think this will stop cheating or something  they'll use tinder or just go out to a pub and pick someone up or fuck a co worker    bringing down this site isn't going to stop people using other sites and apps like tinder and what not to cheat  it will accomplish nothing   they won't take the site down they are not going to give up a site with 40 million (even if most are bots or scammers) accounts because some hackers told them to  they will call the bluff and the hackers won't do anything  got to say i'm getting sick of hackers atm and all the threats and ddos attacks etc etc   the fuck does that have to do with anything?  someone always has to bring up anti-gay/gay shit with everything these days   people don't think of it that way because it isn't the government and at the moment it's "cool" to like hacking groups that do shit like this  just wait until they do it to something that affects them and they will no longer support it   i don't think it will be that bad besides it's necessary after Indonesia cut the amount it imports from Australia many farmers would be up shit creek if another deal wasn't made   it's good that a deal is in the works with china it's a nice fuck you to Indonesia and it will help out farmers here that would of been screwed when Indonesia cut the amount of imports    that's what i thought so many people go to the emergency room for something as simple as the common cold         fuck i'm glad i don't live in america..   i broke my neck 3 years ago had to be airlifted to hospital have surgery to patch up a 20cm cut on my head (had to be put under if anything went wrong) and spend a week there (got lucky it wasn't worse) getting regular xrays ct scans and mri scans and psychotherapy and treatment from spinal specalists not to mention the countless painkillers  cost me $0 and i wasn't even insured at the time.. they never sent the bill for the airlift so i got lucky on that one   he did 500k in his last 5 weeks in office if i recall correctly   he was called kevin 747 for a reason tax payers funded a hell of a lot of his traveling i wouldn't call him one of the "good" politicians    hobby or not i wouldn't call it a dream job  probably worse entry level jobs but compared to retail other jobs most likely would offer more progession into management which looks better on a resume for future jobs.. to me that's far better than being able to talk about video games and get paid for it       never will happen unless you post something about tony abbot sucking a dick or a anti liberal party post it's rare to get it out of single digits  if you use less politics only 5 posts appear   sorry but no they are not liberal/labor are still the two main parties and that's where people vote  the greens simply don't get enough votes to threaten either one of them   i'm guessing the honeymoon period with it ends pretty quickly when they realise it's just a job like any other  getting a game cheaper or a week earlier or something probably gets old when you realise much better jobs are around   i have to say it but how the hell is working at a video game shop a "dream job"  it's a low paying retail job like every other one except you sell video games   i killed the spirit turns out to be the better option anyway  agreed that it was the best quest in the game it's a shame that some of the others were a bit rushed   the gst rise is inevitable i'm actually surprised it's hasn't happened already  as long as low income earners are compensated it actually could do some good         even if police are justified in killing someone people don't care anymore they'll just say fuck the police etc   if you have all the platinum you can control how much is sold similar to how diamonds are sold now (they are not rare just controlled well by companies)  no one would try to sell it all at once   it's a good game and i recommend playing it the story is really good but pretty short (20 or so hours) graphics are good for a 2011 game  a few things about the gameplay that you might not like  potions can't be drunk during combat you have to drink them beforehand (this includes potions like swallow)  no climbing or jumping down unless there is a certain spot the game allows it  no fast travel or horses   should of been in the game from the beginning considering it was in the previous two games   no idea why they couldn't see that before releasing the game.. eredin really should of been a challenge  for me it was a disappointing way to end a amazing game   granted i'm playing on normal but i just finished the game and found the eredin boss fight painfully easy.  i get that i have a lot of skills and good armor and what not at that point but some of the monsters and even high level enemies put up a better fight than him  i didn't even need to use a single potion as it was just way too easy to dodge and when he was using magic he was basically a sitting duck  was a bit a of a disappointment after everything you had to do to prepare to fight him for him to go down so easily   is anyone even scared of anonymous anymore?  will they ddos a website or something and that will be the avenging of the death? that's all they seem to do when they make threats   too many years of the drug war has people believing it's the right way to go about it not to mention countless scare campaigns and the usual BS this nanny state country pulls  people would rather continue fighting a failed drug war and keep criminals rich than try something else like many other countries have  it's why they have no fucking clue what to do about ice atm except those idiotic scare ads which have no effect whatsoever     they might get a few seats but i honestly never see them getting enough of the vote to be in power  	55
 My grandma died this past December at 92. She wasn't the person I knew for the past 6-7 years. She was different. It sucks but I made sure was happy until the end and that's all that mattered to me.   If you saw them and thought they acted suspicious that means they're doing a shitty job of being discreet in order to catch the robbers. It's good you called.   Oh damn!   I'm gonna have to come up to Lubbock for this!!!   Bitch I can't breathe!!!!!!!   I saw that and thought it was absolutely baffling. There was another part where one of the journalists laid down to take a picture of a statue or Kim Il Song, and a party member chaperone blew up, threatening to have them kicked out of the county that day for disrespecting the statue. Fucking crazy.   One day...   Good lord you're like a dream   :((((   Kind of looks like Shiloh from ChaosMen   Hieeeee Ru! I just wanted to say that you are such a huge inspiration and I've been a die hard fan of Drag Race since season 2 when I stumbled upon it. I love all of your ideology and you've helped me learn to really love myself. I really feel it and I know I can do anything I set my mind to. I sometimes get down because I haven't found that one person I can really connect with and to give some of this love to. I'm young and I got time but I can't help feel like something is missing although I have all the pieces in front of me. How do I go about becoming more positive on my outlook towards a prospective partner or finding someone to share myself with? Don't get me wrong, I love my friends and family. What I crave is intimate connection. How do I get what I've desired for so long? Thanks for listening! Can't wait for the new season!   Omg that's on my fucking birthday! YASS GAWD!!!   My parents have a Dauschund that whines and cries during car rides. Our other Dauschund loves car rides and she does too. It's just when we do long car rides over 45 minutes long that she gets anxiety. She's about 6 years old. I've been thinking maybe getting her an anxiety shirt (a thunder shirt I think is what it's called) and see if that would help her. Holding her in your lap sometimes isn't enough and she'll start whining again. I hope the comstant press use and sensation of being held will help her.   I've had great conversations with some nice guys on grindr. Then they ask for a face pic. I either send one because I think "Maybe this guys different. Maybe he won't block me just because of the way I look and we can continue having this awesome talk!" Or I don't send one because I'm too afraid and just want someone to talk to like you do. It never works out after I send a pic. I feel for you bro :(   Wow looking good   I couldn't sexualize him during GotG. He and my brother look too much alike. But I got to pretend my brother made a fucking awesome movie so I find it a fair trade.   And then you look at everyone else like "yeah I did all that shit. I'm a crazy motherfucker"   I already had the lucky egg on me and exp share. Beefed up Cobalion and Terrakion and pretty mush destroyed. I know it was a lazy attic but it worked. Thanks for the advice!   Thanks! I beat them all! I beefed up Cobalion and Terrakion and took out Iris all with Cobalion, one hit each. Felt good.   You go girl! :) starting my journey myself. Keep at it!   Hey everyone. I'm fairly new to playing the video games. I only ever watched the tv show and did the card game when I was younger. So I need advice on how to beat the elite four and the champ in this particular game. Here's the pokemon I currently have on me:  Cobalion lvl 67 Terrakion lvl 54 Magneton lvl 53 Unfezant lvl 51 Golduck lvl 48 Surperior lvl 44  Any advice helps. If I need to go and level up my pokemon more, then I'll do it. If you can give me a strategy so I don't have to do that, even better. Anything helps! Thanks!   Hello to you all! I just found this subreddit and thought I would get some help. I'm 20 and have always had problems with the amount of oil that is produced on my nose. The pores get clogged very quickly as well. I wash my face every day using just a basic Dove men's face and body wash. My face feels good for about 4 hours, and then it feels like I heavily dowsed my face in oil. I need some help! Anything helps!   You means it's not already?   my fried chicken is all over the floor   I hate how true this is   Solomon is bottom   yumm   I can sense this sort of split is going to happen for my father and I sometime in the future because that fact I'm gay and don't agree with his political ideology. It's silly that something like what happened to you can rip families apart. I'm sorry it happened and I hope something better comes out of it. Keep positive!   "Your planes gonna crash! -click-"  I DIED!!!   I was too afraid to put Shannel myself but I'm glad someone else put it. Never really liked her (especially in all stars).   S1: Tammie//Akashia  S2: Raven//NPB  S3: Manila//Alexis or Mimi, I can't decide  S4: I only liked 4 queens overall from this season and they were Sharon, Chad, Latrice, and Willam.  AS1: Jujubee//Mimi  S5: Alaska or Alyssa//Roxxy or Serena  S6: Bianca//Darienne or Swordfish   Oh cool! They're all really beautiful! Hope that I can get one someday.   What's the ratio of her Savannahs?   It is a SeanCody guy and the name is Allen. This is from a scene with another guy.  [Here you go](http://www.myvidster.com/video/24259275/Allen_Jeffrey)   Wish I could compete this year! Won't have the time because I'll be walking children in nature (literally).   That picture of Alaska totally reminds of Ru in her l.a.Eyeworks ad. http://imgur.com/9LsNUc4   From a small town in Texas. This is accurate. Most I've had to wait is 20 minutes. Wasn't a big deal.   http://imgur.com/tOqjPmH   [Now it's no longer a secret](http://imgur.com/tOqjPmH)   It was the cardboard thing that came with underwear that was my material in the beginning. I would pick underwear based off the guy who was on the front.   [Lets get cackling!](http://youtu.be/BQSsrvsszcs)   :(   Definitely not a great feel to feel. "'Tis better to love and lost than never to have loved at all."   What if they never had sex? It's been a year and a half since things were broken off between me and this guy I was seeing. We didn't have an actual relationship, just sort of a friends who really liked each other. I still feel a lot for him. We never had sex in the 8 months we were together. I felt that I genuinely loved him. He just didn't feel the same.  Edit: words   I used to think that the slang and language used within the community was only recently created. Then I watched Paris Is Burning and was educated. I love the film!   RuPaul's Drag Race. The person in the gif is Latrice Royale who was a contestant on season 4 of the show.   The  *shade*   welcome:)   cute ;)   I went to school in Brenham, TX for a year where the original factory/creamery is and one of my friends worked for them. So much free ice cream! He would come from work every day with a small cooler filled with sandwiches and cookie cones (my favorite!), pints, and half gallons.   That's true!   Even if you could get decent prints off the blades, they would still have to be run off databases. It could've been done by someone who's never had their prints taken, like dumb teenagers. The Intergrated Automated Fringerprint Identification System [(IAFIS)](http://m.fbi.gov/#http://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/fingerprints_biometrics/iafis/iafis)  has millions of fingerprints in its database which includes criminals, civilians, and suspected/known terrorists. Even if the comparison was narrowed down to the local level, they have a large possibility of not getting caught. But do I hope these sick fucks get what's coming to them? Absolutely.   Oh fuck. This is hot!   I think the peanut butter is PERFECT. So making these!   I had one serious conversation with a guy on OKC, and it was such a nice one too. I think it was the next day or so, I took a risk and asked him to dinner (which was super uncomfortable for me since I had never actually asked someone out due to the lack of opportunity). It never happened. Not because he said no, but because after I asked him out he stopped talking to me. We were having a great time talking to each other, but I guess he couldn't handle talking to someone face to face.   Anyone have a source?   I haven't had a birthday party since 5th grade. Only one person showed up out of the 10 or so I invited, and even then they only could stay for 30 minutes. I haven't had my own party since. So now that I'm older, if I know of someone with a birthday the same day as mine, I suggest we plan together because I know their friends will show up and I might actually have a decent birthday. I've done it twice now and I had so much fun. I could've cared less about presents, I was just happy people were wishing me a happy birthday.   Hell yes it is. I also like being the one who gives it!   I remember this place as well. I used to talk to a lot of people and it made me feel better. I had a guy that I really liked and he liked me as well and so it was an internet relationship of sorts. Then his mom found out about him and one day I get a call from his phone number, but it was his mom and she accused me of poisoning her son and never to contact him again or she'll call the police. I was 15 at the time and just the threat of police scared me so much. I felt bad for him and also myself because it was the first guy I actually had a connection with. I often wonder how he's doing and if he ever ended up ok. There were other significant people I met but that one has always stayed with me.   I completely agree with you.   We learned the basics of filling out tax forms in our government and economics classes here in my part of Texas. Everyone had to do it.    Here you go!

They look great on you by the way ;)   God you look like this friend of mine from my first year of college I totally crushed on, but you have a beard. Hot hot hot   That would be so fun to watch! Hope that happens. Thank you for answering my questions and I love watching you on Getting On. Have a happy new year!   Hey Alex! I'm a big fan of yours and I'm so glad to see you doing this AMA. I used to watch MadTV ALL THE TIME when you were on it, no matter what character it was. I just wanted to know if there was anything that you miss about the show and do you still keep in touch with your former cast mates? Do you still do live sketch comedy at all? Thank you for making me and my family laugh all these years!   Bear with me, I swear it's all relevant.  I'm a 20 year old gay man who is currently living at home, with a very non existent social life. I've never been in a serious committed relationship where I called him my boyfriend. It's always been strictly physical and I just always went along with it, anything to hopefully have a relationship. I know how that sounds and it took me a whole to realize how ridiculous it is. A guy I was seeing last year (let's call him Bill) ended things after 8 months. During the entire time I thought I was going to get committment from him but it ended on heartbreak. I blame myself for anything I did to make him not want me.  Fast forward and we're good friends. I forgave him, and after a nice break from him I got over my feelings for him. He started seeing this girl and I was fine with everything. He said he wasn't into going full on with a guy. This past Sunday he says things didn't work with this girl. It was too bad because he liked this girl. Later on he shows me a letter and says it's to his "boyfriend." My heart actually sunk and I snapped. I went off. He said they'd been seeing each other for two months and then he asked him to be his boyfriend. I was shocked. Literally. He's free to do what he wants, it's just the only that bothered me was that he was so quick to commit to this guy he met two months ago. I spent 8 whole months working on him, trying to get him to commit, and it takes this guy two months.  I went off. I cried in anger, I was sobbing uncontrollably for four hours. What did this new guy do that I didn't? Is it me? After Bill, I searched for someone to make me feel whole, loved and like I wasn't hopeless. I had met this guys in September who I though was going to be the guy to commit and after two months he just stopped talking to me.  I think I have depression and I might be bipolar (all of which hasn't been diagnosed because of how afraid I am to see someone). I've never felt lower. I just get rejected and then Bill commits making me plunge. I almost did something drastic to myself. Despite all the desire to end it, I stomached my pain and reached out to my dad. I didn't tell him about being gay, but I told him I needed help. But he tells me that maybe I should "pray more" because "God will fix it" and that I need to "rid [myself] of the Devil."  I finally got the courage to reach out, and it feels like it was made into a joke. I don't consider myself religious. I'm spiritual but I don't believe in God (if that makes sense). I prayed to him since I was 12 to make the desires for other boys go away, and since I was 15 to make my suicidal thoughts go away and to make me not so sad all the time. People say he works in mysterious ways, but making me and others like me suffer so much is plain cruel.   Despite my dad being an ass, after the holidays, I'm going to make an appointment with my doctor and take the steps nescessary to beat these feelings. Telling him gave me the strength. I just needed somewhere to say all this.   I'm not going to entertain a fucking troll like yourself anymore.   I never said my theory was right, that's exactly why I said theory. It's my opinion and what I would think would happen in a practical situation. So excuse me Mr. Expert. But dogs CAN deliver false positives in ANY situation. Just because they're cadaver dogs doesn't make them extra special and excuse them from that probability.  I hate to break it to you, but you're also a dick.   ...I've done this before :/   They still can deliver a false positive. I theorize that the cadaver dog would not be able to detect any further smells after they expose the dead animal because his nose would be overwhelmed. The police would probably dig, find the dog, conclude the cadaver dog gave them a false positive and move on.   I hope you two continue being best friends. I told my best friend during the summer after junior year and he said he still was my best friend and he'll always love me like a brother. I haven't heard from him since 2012.   I only met her one time though. I'm confident I won't ever feel sad about her. I feel bad for the ones she left behind, but not her. From what I remember she was a very unsavory person, but now that I know she was depressed, I can see where that image I have if her comes from. I just thought she was a bitter, angry snob. It makes more sense now.   I'm confident my sadness or depression stems from me being gay and having to repress it all these years. I haven't told my parents because I know how strongly they feel about homosexuality and I don't want to lose my parents over it. I know that this sort of thing only happens in extremes cases but I would consider it that due to how my parents speak about it. Whenever they have to share their thoughts on how wrong and disgusting they think all gay people are, I do get some comfort from my brother who knows. I want to tell them about the depression and my sexuality but I don't want to be hurt from the very people who are supposed to love and support me unconditionally.   She jumped off the Golden Gate Bridge. She was 41, I believe. I never knew her that well. I only met her once in my life back when I was in elementary school. My cousin had been diagnosed with depression some time ago and had been battling it intensely with therapy and medication. I was told by other family members closer to her that she even considered doing some form of voluntary electroshock therapy to cope with the feelings and make them go away.   I myself have been struggling with sadness and horrible self-esteem issues. I myself have never been to a therapist because I'm too afraid of what my parents might think or say, or if they ask the reasons why I want professional help.  When you hear about someone's death, you're supposed to feel remorse, sorrow, sadness. Typically this is me too, but it was different this time because it struck a chord with me. It angered me. I became jealous of my cousin. She escaped her hell. I'm still in mine because I don't have the guts to off myself or get help. Does it make me a monster for not feeling sympathy? For being heartless? To be selfish in this way?   	82
    I swear to god reddit is full of idiots and trash today.   No, it's not. Some fucked up child porn/snuff shit shouldn't be ok because it's fake. It's still fucked up child porn/snuff shit.    Dude, can you blame him? This thing is years and years old.   I actually have that one. I don't get much occasion to wear it though.   Ok, let me explain this to you in a way you might understand. See, the video was taken with a device that is known as a "smart phone", "iphone", "android", or something along those lines. When they shot the video they were holding their device vertically (that means up and down, not side to side) and so the result is a tall, skinny video. (Bonus fact: if you hold the device sideways, it will take pictures and videos that actually look right on screens.) So when the video is shown on a short, wide screen, there's nothing for the sides, usually they're just left black. But rather than  showing black, some folks will extend (extend means stretch) the edges out, or show a blurry piece of the video so it's less distracting (distracting means it draws attention away from where you're supposed to be looking.)     Sorry about the big words.   Gee, that joke hasn't ever gotten old over the last 487 times I've heard it. I think it's a bit past time to let that one go.   That's what I use. It works with all my devices.   It says what I wrote, and there was a plant here once upon a time.    Are you looking at a different pic than me? It doesn't just end, it goes into a curve on the bottom right.    It's not even close to finished yet, they've only just struck it off. It's a fine job for where they're at. If you can't make it nice by the time it's done, you aren't a finisher.   Awesome? What does not showing a link change?  Still getting the same shit spam, never clicked the links before, this changes nothing at all.    Amen. Hate the e.       lol I just noticed you posted in Straight Talk, sorry. Well Straight Talk has terrible customer service. I kept getting the Indian folk who could only read back from their computers, they had no real knowledge or power outside of what they see on their monitors. I did some Googling and finally found a number that got me American support. They had actual knowledge and was able to help me with my activation. I was able to buy an activation kit (really just bought a code)  over the phone, and got me going. I would assume an unlocked phone would work, but it might take a bit of effort to get going.    I don't know if you can, but I would definitely try to activate it on Straight Talk first. Same Verizon network, half the price.    I remember when the Sega CD drive attachment came out, I went to our Target which had only been open a week to get one. It was $150 maybe, but rang up as a Nintendo game for $50. I saw the mistake at the counter, but didn't say anything. So I got it for 50 bucks.    I felt a little wrong getting it, and don't do things like that anymore, but the girl saw the readout, looked at the box, gave me a look, and let me have it. So I didn't feel too much like a thief.   I would love to have the accumulated karma for the posts of this gif.    Aw, is it too hard to follow the conversation? Try harder next time, you might get it right.   My friend likes his, too, but it's the first non-stock mouse he's ever had, so I'm gonna give him a different one to try out, see what he thinks.   ...so why didn't you just ignore my comment?    I love how you get downvoted for not being on some gamer's dick.    Edit : Aw, crap, I don't want to blow him either, there goes my karma...    Yeah, but what value does this post offer anyone? News? Entertainment? No, it's just "Yay, it's some gamer's birthday today!" What does this knowledge do for anyone?    My friend has this. I loathe it. It's uncomfortable and the buttons are the worst. I'm constantly changing scrolling functions when browsing.    I have a 1 and 2xs,they both work as well as they ever did.    lol Seems like a good idea, but no go. A plant isn't going spend the money to open an extra day to make their employees' jobs easier.   Not sure if OP is trolling or a moron.    Yeah, it's frozen for 24 hrs between the kill floor and cut floor. Mondays are rough, they're frozen hard from days in the cold freeze, and most all workers on the floor use knives, not bandsaws. Wrist killers.      Auto-reload is. It doesn't do what that script is doing, changing the speed of the reload.   TIL, that people really overuse, commas too often.   ...I have no response to any of that. And since you're starting to attack me, I'm done here.   Slippery slope there. If changing the functionality of the game using knowledge gleaned outside of the game isn't cheating, then they should go ahead and let us level up weapons. It's all the same, using something outside of skill to gain an advantage over other players.   That's my outlook on it, anyway.   And I love how redditors still don't give a shit about redditiqutte. Keep them downvotes coming.   I thought it was common knowledge.   If you're changing the speed of your reload, how is that not changing how the game works?   Has to be fake. You just can't trust anyone who owns bongos.   So your friend is a stripper?   I can't remove mine either. Haven't been able to for a couple months. And I only tried to remove them after none of them would work. I just moved them to the bottom, and forgot about them.

I've just assumed that it's either a bug or that some specification of the audio must be incompatible, I just haven't gotten around to really researching the Plex specs.    Really I chalk it up to folks being too lazy to search. It's easier to ask once, and get responses from folks who know what you mean no matter your wording or nuance, than to hunt through Google hits searching for your solution. Which isn't a bad thing at all. It's when a simply worded search suffices to bring up a page full of answers that bugs me. You simply drop your legwork into someone else's lap. Er,  not you as in you, you as in anyone. You know what I mean.    [Did you try this?](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=remove+positive+finds+chrome)   I just edit the sort title on series of movies.

A start screen, translate, a few others, and that's it. I really don't miss enough of the others to even remember a lot of them.   I am certain that is wrong.

 Obama has sent a team of officials to the ISIS leaders' funeral, offering his sympathies and promising a full investigation into civil rights abuses by the Iraqi army.   If the Marines can't wear their uniform in America due to threat of Islamic attack, then we have lost.  Might as well put a minaret on the National Mall.      No criticism of Chris Rock when he was supporting Obama, but Trump says the exact same thing and the state-run media loses it.      It only took 4 days for the order to come and it only came after public outrage.      Obama sat in a pew for 20 years listening to Jeremiah "God Damn America" Wright.  Seriously, what would one expect?     Hogwash. This absolutely is about 'current US politics'.  "Yesterday's heresy is tomorrow's orthodoxy."   You do know a Democrat has been President for 7 years?   Schedules change. Life is hard.  Drive on.  Do Democrats eventually want all people to stay in bed 24/7 and get airdropped food,water and money from a government drone?      Would a white cop helping one of the black power protestors get such aclaim?  Stop holding black people to lower standards.   Epidemic of black on white violence across the country -- Reddit silence.  20 people marching with a flag  -- Reddit outrage.       There is no grey area or new, uncharted problem.    We have laws already in place to handle people who sneak across our borders.  We don't need "reform", we need enforcement.    It's all fun and games until it bites your face off.   I'm saying the exact opposite.   You are actually saying this action is okay because it's no more rogue than previous President's actions.   And this is why you don't compare politicians to previous politicians.  You get the type of leadership we have in Washington DC today.      This is what happens when a rogue President orders ICE/BP to stop enforcing laws.      But hey, at least we aren't racist for opposing Obamacare right?  Right?!

Even if he is really cool.   Just a white person killed.  Who cares?  To use Obama's words, I guess she was just a "typical white person".      The petulent boy king is following his promises to create law and treaties without Congressional approval.      More cheese for you.   A random Russian mining company donated $1 million to the Clinton Foundation.  They were subsequently given uranium rights in Wyoming by the State Dept.    Draw your own conclusions.   Will Walmart, Apple, etc announce a ban of Crescent flags?  Of course not.  They are boot licking cowards.   And the never-ending expansion of centralized government continues.  Naive Redditors praise the increased subservience to a small group of elites in Washington DC.   Just like Obama waited for the details to be sorted out on Trayvon Martin and Mike Brown   Obama called the shooting a "heartbreaking circumstance."  Disgusting.      Will liberals support banning the Crescent flag now?   "The shooter also was killed. Two law enforcement sources told CBS News that the shooting suspect was identified as Muhammad Youssef Abdulazeez."  The religion of peace strikes again.  Edit: Will Obama address it? Will he give a shout out to people beforehand like his Fort Hood address? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aYldhOp1p34      Women are just as a capable as men in ground combat only in the Book of Social Justice Fairy Tales.   People want to work longer hours.  However, Obamacare penalizes full-time employment by making small businesses provide exorbitant health care plans to full-time workers.  How well do you think small business will do when they have to pay $2k a month per employee on health plans?  Obamacare crushes small businesses and thus its workers.   "Artist"   Except I'm just a citizen and not in a leadership position for the country.  Leadership 101:  Be inclusive to all the people you are leading.   The "right" in America is for limited centralized government, something I don't think Hitler would have supported.      Here's a hint.  Compare crime in Appalachia, the poorest area in the nation, to Baltimore, Chicago, etc.   Obama continues to divide America into classes.      The government does not produce freedom.  Your penance is 5 Declarations of Independence.   Liberals love free speech, provided they agree with it.

 Yep. Looking at his filmography, I have. Definitely a name I'll look out for from now on.   I don't believe I've ever seen one of his films before now. If any of them are like this, I'm pretty interested in seeing his other works!   The movie is really emotional and does have a lot of action. JG put on an awesome performance and was super believable!   All I can say is wow. Jake Gyllenhaal is unrecognizable from his character in Nightcrawler and did a phenomenal job which just goes to show the range he can achieve. While the plot is a little predictable, the movie really is great and the performances are very believable (especially from the daughter, Oona Laurence). On a final note, James Horner's score was amazing and really added to the feel of the whole movie. As someone who's not really into sports films, this movie really was wonderful and I recommend you all go see it if you get the chance.   And that's true. You don't really even need to know who Max is to enjoy the movie. But if you're looking for backstory, the other movies are where to go.   I really disliked it. I felt it was trying really hard to be deep and vulgar and just ended up coming off as, for lack of a better word, conceited.   With the no back story thing, you do realize this is the fourth movie in a franchise, right?   You fuckin bet!      If you like Sci Fi, they're both definitive films and really great!   Wow, it's cool seeing these guys on here. I remember them handing out demos outside a concert I'd gone to years ago!   Awesome! Hope you enjoy. :)   I love it! It's a really clever and funny show. I think you can watch it for free on Adult Swim's website if you want to check it out.      That Terminator bust is sick!   HUH, I didn't know this was a theory. That's just how I always thought it was.      I had no idea people didn't like Quantum of Solace. I thought it was pretty good.   My Questions is my favorite song off of Dead Throne. That ending is so intense.   I fucking love Celldweller.   I started doing it ironically and now I just do it because I'm used to it so it isn't ironic anymore.    Exactly!   Think of it like war drums. It's purely there to boost the morale of their own soldiers and put fear into the hearts of their enemies.   WRX buddy! I have a 2004 :)   You're definitely right about the sequel, but I like the first movie.   All of those are designs submitted by redditors and 4chan users.   Oh, I know. It's from the trailer. I just wanted to keep the title concise.   Yeah, I think I saw another post in the new section that was a gallery of screenshots.   I haven't played online a lot recently but feel free to add me!  GAH2009      No, I had it a long time ago, too.   Not at all.   I know! They seem like such fun little cars.   No, but just laughing in their face could seriously fuck with their self esteem. I know it would mine. It's not like they *know* she has a boyfriend or anything.   If I'm not mistaken, the Capuccino is legal to import now, isn't it?   Mission Impossible 3   There's a preorder bonus. It's just some other car parts, though.   Man, I love that red.   I know it's not exactly what you're looking for, but you should definitely check out Wasteland 2. It's a really great game. It's an RPG with turn based combat instead of 4x though, if that's a deal breaker.   Would you say it was... Viral marketing?   JC2 and GTA don't use the same models or physics.   Gosh, he killed it in that movie. I love it!   The buildup is no doubt because it's been raining here everyday for a good while. Assuming these are recent pictures.   Yes! Oh, man I really want a matching set for the trilogy!   I just checked and couldn't find it. Are you sure?   Damn, I wish I got that Guardians one. :/   Don't hold me to this, but I swear I heard he was working on something now.   I can see why they did. Big Hollywood film where the last human on Earth is the bad guy makes it hard to relate to. I think it would've been great had they done the book's way, though.   I'm having amazing fun with it, but I have one complaint. What the fuck happened to being able to pause cutscenes? Like in any game?   Hey! I was born on my dad's birthday!   Jesus, could you be a little more condescending to someone you know little to nothing about?   Damn, that's a lot of stuff xD   Oh ok. Thanks for clearing that up!   So do we have to buy new players in order to use these discs?   And my fucking math book came with no bindings. Reselling that's gonna be impossible.   I think the 25th Anniversary one came with digital copies. I'm not completely sure, though. We have them all on our iTunes, but I can't remember if we got those somewhere else or with that trilogy.   Mm, so euphoric.   Are you saying they refused to marry you because you weren't on their records as a regular attendee?   Same. Some people do really stupid stuff in dangerous conditions.   Yeah. I can see that. For playing what feels like the same role, he's very good at that role.   I love his stuff, but I wish he put out content more often.   I've never understood the obsession with him. He's a pretty average actor of you ask me.   I've never had anyone say anything about it. Most people don't care, but there's always a chance you'll get someone that's a little too serious about these things.    Breaking her in early, huh?   It's just in my windshield. I don't necessarily like that either, but I think it looks better than being mounted on the front.   Haha! Yeah, we're getting a little sun where I am now. Still crazy.      That's a beautiful car, dude! I'm jealous.   You're right. Reddit kind of sucks because people like you always feel the need to say something rude instead of keeping their mouths shut and moving on.   Shut your goddamn mouth. That car is ridiculously cool.   I actually went to high school with one.  Her opinions were really stupid and annoying, but it's not the same as the internet portrays it.   Was the first Evil Dead really a comedy? I felt like they were trying to make a legitimate low budget horror film that just ended up being ridiculous and they went with it with the sequels. Or did they do it on purpose?   Same, I had one show up from the dead 4 or 5 times.   Well, then I guess you buy a new one. They're like $8. But what if it's the Stratavarious of recorders? Then what? HUH?   Hey, that's not too bad. BF4 only had 10 when it came out.   Why would you let go of any instrument as sophisticated as the recorder?   Mom: Porsche Panamera 4  Dad: soon-to-be Porsche Macan  Sister: Jeep Patriot  Me: 2004 Subaru WRX Sedan   It's a bra and it just protects the paint on the front of the car.   Whoa. Someone should make all three into a wallpaper!   Hah it's like the definition of a first world problem.   "I didn't get the right color case on my Blu Ray and now I'm pissed"   /u/trollabot test_subject7429   I'm jealous, man.  I got the slip, but not the red case for Birdman.   I don't know if it's actually her favorite, but she enjoys Harry Potter enough to watch them all over the course of a few days like twice a year.   It was the same for me when I got my first car.  Had never even heard of the Suzuki SX4 before.  BUT EVERYONE HAS ONE.   A group of my teachers from senior year of high school went to trivia regularly, as did students.  They got hammered half the time.   I failed the first time because I was a nervous wreck. I was trying to remember everything and in doing that I tried to turn left into oncoming traffic... Twice. But I took the test again the very next day and did an almost perfect run!   I saw them on their current tour, and I have to respectfully disagree with you. I was expecting what you're talking about and he exceeded my expectations. Mike absolutely kills it live.   That movie was a fucking masterpiece.   Yep, my dad too. "Why'd he do that?" "It's in the script."   I went with my mom because she wanted to see it. God, that movie is so *long.*   \*subaru rumble*   Shitty student. Don't know what I want anymore.   Not any males. For whatever reason I don't feel comfortable opening up to guys. I do have two female friends that I can talk to about most things, though.   Spartans of the road, man.   Sorry, but that sounds like Nero from DMC4  	95

  who seriously cares?  The animals care. I'm sure you can think of other things that people did for thousands of years that we do not find ethical today.      My favorites are skewed toward the animal rights side of veganism (as opposed to recipes and food blogs). Here are my suggestions:  [Mercy For Animals](http://www.mfablog.org/)  [Choose Veg](http://www.chooseveg.com/blog)  [Animal Ethics](http://www.animal-ethics.org/)  [Sentience Politics](http://sentience-politics.org/)  [Reducing Suffering](http://reducing-suffering.org/)      I have shared pictures of myself a few times. [This](https://np.reddit.com/r/vegan/comments/387pv9/action_for_animals_is_trusting_me_to_watch/) is the one that /u/ansile is referring to though.   +/u/User_Simulator test_subject7471   +/u/User_Simulator  /u/test_subject7471   I still remember that picture you shared when your account was briefly shadowbanned. You belong in the hottest vegan competition too!                                                                                             Are you going to do something about that?   Some CAFOs really are good  Temple Grandin is awful. Why does anyone take her seriously?   Seventh Day Adventists are the religious group you are thinking of. A good amount of research on vegetarian and vegan diets has used them as the study population.   Why should we be working so hard to keep these kids from caring about and protecting these other animals? Why can't we accept that not killing them is okay?   For every person he doesn't preach to, I'm going to preach to three.                                                            Could you further articulate why you think that would follow from my previous comment?  There will still be suffering that happens in the world if you go vegan, but that shouldn't be an excuse to prevent us from doing the things we can to lessen the suffering that exists.   I live near San Francisco. We have everything.   You don't need to be human to be an "other". Other animals are individuals with lives and interests of their own that ought to be respected.   Even if you ignore this, animal agriculture has a huge contribution to global warming, leads to large amounts of nitrate runoff, and uses a disproportionate amount of water and other resources. Even if you completely ignore the harm to non-human animals there are substantial impacts to other humans to consider.   Do your dairy cows live out their full lives and die of old age or are they still sent to slaughter when their production begins to drop?  How do they react when they are separated from their offspring?   There are tons of animal rights groups out there doing excellent work. Check out the groups that [Animal Charity Evaluators](http://www.animalcharityevaluators.org/recommendations/top-charities/) recommends as being the most effective.   If someone else is behaving in a way that is harmful to others then I think people should speak up about that. Sorry that you don't like hearing about it.   Just imagine if we allowed experimenting on humans without their consent though. We could very likely have expanded that age even further.  Nonetheless, (I hope) you would be on the side protesting against that. Extending life for some is great, but cannot be justified at any cost.  Our society does not yet fairly factor in the complex and sophisticated interests and lives possessed by many other animals when deciding how we allow them to be treated. If we were to give just consideration to other animals we would find that many of the experiments we conduct today still would not be justified. We would also need to acknowledge that the animals being raised for food on contemporary farms, and animals being used for entertainment in circuses or zoos are also facing a brutal injustice.    If you take out factory farming, the numbers change considerably. Just because the most popular method for producing meat is harmful doesn't mean they all are. Here is a detailed article going into depth on why pasture grazing is needed. Pasture grazing creates critical habitat for many species.  The reason these cruel factory farms exist is because they are efficient. Yes, there may be more diversity when allowing cattle to graze on uncultivated grasslands, but it comes at a far larger cost of land, and [higher greenhouse gas emissions](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2535638/):  Adding the carbon debt resulting from the additional cleared land required by the two-thirds less efficient grass finishing process (26.6 million acres  10,400 lb/acre/year, or 276.6 billion lb/year) results in the organic system totaling 770 billion lb of CO2-equivalent GHG emissions; or 58% higher than the conventional systems total of 487.5 billion lb.                                          Check out [VeganBodyBuilding.com](http://veganbodybuilding.com/) for some encouragement.  You may also find vegan athlete [Frank Medrano](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFPsvF3UOdo) particularly inspiring.  Reddit has /r/veganfitness where you can ask any other questions you have.      According to the [American Dietetic Association](http://www.eatright.org/WorkArea//DownloadAsset.aspx?id=8417):  It is the position of the American Dietetic Association that appropriately planned vegetarian diets, including total vegetarian or vegan diets, are healthful, nutritionally adequate, and may provide health benefits in the prevention and treatment of certain diseases. Well-planned vegetarian diets are appropriate for individuals during all stages of the life cycle, including pregnancy, lactation, infancy, childhood, and adolescence, and for athletes.  Similarly, the [British Dietetic Association](https://www.bda.uk.com/foodfacts/vegetarianfoodfacts) describes veganism as a type of vegetarian diet and continues:  Well planned vegetarian diets can be both nutritious and healthy. They have been associated with lower risks of heart disease, type 2 diabetes, obesity, certain types of cancer and lower blood cholesterol levels.  Well planned vegetarian diets are appropriate for all stages of life.  The position of the Australian Government's [National Health and Medical Research Council](http://www.nhmrc.gov.au/_files_nhmrc/publications/attachments/n55_australian_dietary_guidelines_130530.pdf) is that:  Appropriately planned vegetarian diets, including total vegetarian or vegan diets, are healthy and nutritionally adequate. Well-planned vegetarian diets are appropriate for individuals during all stages of the lifecycle.  Finally the [Dietitians of Canada](http://www.dietitians.ca/Nutrition-Resources-A-Z/Factsheets/Vegetarian/Eating-Guidelines-for-Vegans.aspx) state:  A vegan eating pattern has many potential health benefits. They include lower rates of obesity, heart disease, high blood pressure, type 2 diabetes and certain types of cancer. Other benefits include lower blood cholesterol levels and a lower risk for gallstones and intestinal problems.  This eating pattern can take some extra planning. Vegans must make sure that enough nutrients like protein, iron, zinc, calcium, vitamins D and B12 and omega-3 fats are included.  A well planned vegan diet can meet all of these needs. It is safe and healthy for pregnant and breastfeeding women, babies, children, teens and seniors.   But what if, like the REG article states, it is possible to get much more money donated to the groups ACE recommends by donating to ACE, which will then get many other people to donate to the charities they recommend?  For instance: Donating $1000 towards the staff of a meta-charity may generate several thousand dollars of direct donations that would not have been made otherwise, or would have gone to less cost-effective interventions. Instead of donating my money towards helping people directly and thus creating one additional direct donor, I might be able to create many direct donors by going meta and donating towards the promotion of charitable giving.  GiveWell, whose main meta-activity is cost-effectiveness research, tracks their money moved. If we compare this amount to all their expenses so far, we get a fund ratio thats in the ballpark of 30:1, too.   Should I be donating to a [meta-charity](http://reg-charity.org/meta-charities/) like [Animal Charity Evaluators](http://www.animalcharityevaluators.org/) or giving money directly to the groups they recommend?   Esther and I are feeling a bit hungry. I hope you don't mind if we make ourselves a few PB J sandwiches while we are here.   **Ingredients**  * 1 can chickpeas, reserving a small handful for the avocado cream (you can cook dried ones as well) * 3 cloves garlic * 1 small onion * 2 teaspoons ground cumin * A BIG bunch of both fresh parsley and coriander * Salt and pepper * 2 Tablespoons olive oil * 3/4 cup chickpea flour (sometimes called gram flour) * Burger buns and fresh tomato for serving  **For the avocado cream and tahini mayo**  * 1 avocado * A small handful chickpeas left from can * A bunch of fresh parsley * 1 garlic clove * 2 tablespoons tahini * The juice of one lemon * 2 tablespoons water  **Directions**  Throw your chickpeas, peeled garlic, onion, cumin and salt and pepper into a food processor and pulse until roughly blended. Youll need to scrape down the sides. Now add in the fresh herbs, oil and flour and blend until you have a nice thick texture, but it will still be fairly moist. Place into a bowl and if you need, add a little more flour to help the mixture bind as you form them into the patties. Make them small or big as you prefer. In a flat frying pan, heat about half an inch of oil over medium to high and add in your burgers. Cook for about 4 -5 minutes on both sides and once they are on their second turn, press them gently to make them flatter if you need. They should turn a nice dark, golden brown and smell divine!  For the avocado cream, simply add to your processor the avocado (without skin of course!), the remaining chickpeas, parsley and 1 garlic clove and blend until smooth. For the tahini mayo, drop the two tablespoons of tahini into a small bowl with the lemon juice and water and whisk with folk until you have a creamy consistency.  Toast the bun, add the burger, then the avocado, then a slice of tomato and finish with the oozy, lovely tahini mayo!      [What about sexy Waldo](http://i.imgur.com/CgTD5Gg.jpg)?                                                      You will never be able to maintain a healthy relationship if she is keeping you from doing what you feel is right. Tell her that you care about her and that you understand her reservations, but that this is something you feel you need to do nonetheless. There is no reason this decision should interfere with your relationship unless she is choosing to sabotage things.   When you find something good submit it to the recipe and food subreddits. You'll be amazed how many omnis get excited to try out vegan dishes after seeing a delicious looking picture.   I suppose it is possible for people to hold views that do not align with their actions.                                                                                                    [They have several clips from the film on their Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/OhadLife). A lot of the comments seem to be asking where people can buy or watch it, but nobody seems to be providing an answer. It looks like they are still screening the movie here and there before they make it widely available.    Everyone feels like veganism is going to be difficult until they give it a shot. Every vegan I know says it was much easier than they expected.  One thing you may find helpful is to commit to going vegan a day or two a week at first. That way you can find new foods that you enjoy without cutting everything else out at once. From there it becomes much easier to be vegan another day per week until you get up to full time!   Avoiding animal products does not limit someone to a single dietary option. You still have a huge diversity of foods to choose from. You can still mix up your ratios of macro nutrients to cover any extreme or anywhere in the middle. You can still eat low or high calorie, target specific micro nutrients, avoid sugar or eat lots of it.   Being vegan isn't a single diet plan. It is a choice people make to behave in a way that causes less harm to others, but that doesn't mean removing any aspect of choice from our lives.      I think this is one more important step to getting people to change their eating habits. People are aware of the terrible cruelty to animals that happens on these farms. People are increasingly becoming aware of the large environmental impact of raising animals for food (not just in terms of global warming but they also require a lot of water and produce a lot of waste, far more than we could ever appropriately use as fertilizer, which leads to runoff, pollution of drinking water, and dead zones). People know that there are many healthier and often more affordable alternatives to animal products available. People are increasingly worried about antibiotic resistant bacteria and other health hazards created by factory farms. Adding this outbreak will only hasten the shift toward alternatives.  Per capita meat consumption in the US is down by about 10% since 2007. People do care about the huge negative consequences of animal agriculture, and within the next 10-20 years we will see some substantial progress.                           I have 6 submissions to /r/philosophy in the past month. In the month prior to that I also had 6 submissions.                                 I have been using OKCupid on and off for several years now. I have met a handful of vegan women that I dated for at least a couple months. I'm not dating anyone now, so no success story for me, but that is probably my fault more than OKCupid's. It also means you can find me on there if you want to ask me out ;-).                                                               For those who don't know about it, Vegan Republic is an awesome little vegan grocery store in Berkeley. [Here is a link to their Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/RepublicofV). I stop by there whenever I want to get special vegan treats that aren't available in a typical supermarket.      They say ignorance is bliss, but most people still choose to find out the truth when presented with a choice.    I like meat. That is a good enough reason for me.  I believe this is an attempt to expand upon the ideas of the C-is-for-cookie school of philosophical thought started by the great philosopher Cookie Monster.

Nutrients that vegetarians may need to focus on include protein, iron, calcium, zinc, and vitamin B12.  **[The National Health and Medical Research Council](http://www.nhmrc.gov.au/_files_nhmrc/publications/attachments/n55a_australian_dietary_guidelines_summary_130530.pdf)**   Alternatives to animal foods include nuts, seeds, legumes, beans and tofu.

Australians following a vegetarian diet can still meet nutrient requirements if energy needs are met and the appropriate number and variety of serves from the Five Food Groups are eaten throughout the day.

 People don't get hit points or skill points. You train and get better with your class skill, simple as that.    I love it. Ingrained classism. A fighter breaks off from his combat classes to hang out with a mage and rogue. They become adventuring 'brothers'.    The classes are strictly adhearing to those found in Dungeons and Dragons   "Oh, look at the Ice Mage everyone! Jesus, this guy can't go on a date without making nipplecicles!"   Yeah, I'm considering writing a biweekly series on my website!   What if monsters either appeared or some animals become extremely violent or mutant into monsters?    Necromancers are renowned for being super creepy. People tend not to like them and necromancers tend to stay away from other classes and train with each other. Bards are seen as silly but somewhat useful, like Aquaman. I'm not sure if school should even be a thing anymore, since tutelage and apprenticeship under a more experienced class member would do good for a younger one. Magic users would have labs and facilities for testing magic and research and rogues would have guilds and underground operations.      There are no 'normal' people. Everyone is some sort of class, even if the ability is rather lame or limited. Since the class is known at birth, kids couldn't hide their class from the family. Magical classes are stronger politically than the other races, but most are far more concerned with magic, like scientists.  Fighters have larger populations, with rogues and thieves being second.    I could see sports becoming far more brutal. Fighters would be prized in that position, weapons would be allowed and the field would be rigged with traps. Clerics would be standing by for a quick revive or healing gaping wounds.    She'd break out and join a thieves guild. Oh, think about how kids nowadays accept others despite their differences. You'd have 'adventurer parties' formed at a young age by kids in various classes and races, banding together. Think about high school, and how you had a group of friends who banded together. Now imagine that but with a teenage knight, warlock, thief and bard.    I could see an argument between a teenage mage and his fighter class parents playing out like the classic 'coming out' discussion that ends with the kid being kicked out for being a mage. "No son of mine is going to practice 'fairy' magic!"   EVERYONE is born with a class. There isn't a set pattern either. A child of two barbarian class people might be a rogue or mage. I was also thinking that somethings would regress somewhat, like schooling would slow to a crawl due to kids being more interested in their abilities and undertaking quests than learning, or doctors being replaced with Clerics.   I don't know, that's what's scaring me now. I don't now how they got him, and I don't want to know.   Hey World Builders,  I had a concept for a new rpg where character classes are applied to people in the modern day, giving them abilities and powers associated to the class. The assigned class is shown on a unremovable tattoo on the forearm that manifests at birth. My question is, what would the ramifications be in this world? Would divides between character classes start manifesting?    What would your superpower and costume be as well?   I had just graduated high school when I got my first job. In my small town, it was the only job that would accept a kid like me with little work experience, so I took it. My daily work consisted of the typical jobs at a gas station. I would take out the trash, ring up customers at the register and stock the cooler. I actually enjoyed every aspect of the job, but one problem remained, my boss, Todd.   Todd was a overweight man with pockmarked and sallow skin. He constantly smelled of beer and cheap cigarettes. Although he was my manager and boss, I held no respect for him because of his attitude and blatant racism. Whenever he could mistreat the Mexican day laborers who would come in for refreshments, he told me and my coworker, Cisco, to raise the prices on sodas and Gatorade. Other times, he would make demoralizing remarks about African Americans, even within ear shot of me. He would try and backpedal, but I knew his intent. One day when the day laborers came in, I gave them all free drinks as a 'fuck you' to Todd. The next day when I came in, I saw that he'd put me on night shift for that Saturday.   It wasn't bad for the first few hours. Cisco and Lee, my friends from the dayshift and fellow Todd sufferers, stopped by to spend sometime with me. We played some Pathfinder like we usually did when things got slow, but as the evening got on, they went home. It was around nine at night when I heard the scratching from the freezer. I was stationed at the cashier with 'The Mountains of Madness' when the scratches kept getting louder. I got up and headed into the back. The freezer had a large metal door that was at least four inches thick, made out of steel. I knocked on it.   "Cisco, is that you?" I called. Cisco had the habit of getting locked in the freezer, but he'd gone home several hours ago. I tried to think about what the hell could be in there, but it didn't make sense. The backdoor wasn't left open, so raccoons couldn't get in, and I was in the front, no one could slip past me unnoticed. The rasping on the door got louder and I could hear the shuffling of something on the other side. No, not shuffling, a wet sucking sound, like a wet suction cup on a hard surface. I gripped the handle and wrenched open the freezer, but instead of the rows of sodas and bottled coffee, I saw- well I'm still not sure what I saw.   It looked to be a world entirely of meat and sinew. It was a vast, red expanse, like a desert. It quivered every so often, like how a horse twitches it's rump. In the expanse of red were house sized lumps that occasionally spurted yellow fluid, like a geyser. In the sky hung a large grey planet with black spikes sticking out of the sides, like a cartoon sun. But then I saw the being in front of me. It was like a massive sea anemone, with a wide conical base that tapered into a meaty point dotted with yellow pinpricks. Suction cupped tentacles hung from the larger base, waving around without a sense of direction. In the center of the base was a sideways mouth that hung open, lined with fangs. On it's back were what appeared to be yellowish lumps that quivered and writhed as if they were alive. As I stared at the creature, I saw that there were others like it in the background, surrounding one of the house sized tumors. The tumor shook and suddenly split open as a pink humaniod thing slid out and on to the fleshy ground, shaking and screaming obscenities in english. I looked closer and realized it was Todd! His overweight body was covered in a thick film of pink slime that quivered as he tried to crawl away. The creatures surrounded Todd and began tearing into him mercilessly as he howled and cried. After a second, the sounds stopped and were replaced by the wet crunches and tearing of those monsters. The creature in front of me seemed to get it's bearings and lashed out with a tentacle, but I slammed the freezer door as hard as possible, before pushing my body against it. The door managed to slam shut with a hiss, but when I looked down, I saw the end of the purple tentacle, wriggling around on the floor like a lizard's tail. I grabbed one of the mason jars we sold in the store and managed to carefully contain. I hid it in my closet and didn't tell anyone.   I eventually forgot about the tentacle as I quit the job and moved on with my life. I recently came home after my first year of college at University of North Texas. As I drove into town past my place of former employment, I suddenly remembered my secret. I raced home and ran into my room, not even saying hello to my very confused family. I wrenched open my closet door and dug through the piles of clothes to find an shattered mason jar.           Hey World Builders,  Working on a modern day werewolf series. The werewolves in universe live in various hidden communities across the world, in out of the way places. I'm wondering what those communities could look like and how they'd accept new werewolves.    They exist in Pantaria. It's implied that at one point they were more invested in lower beings, but now they don't really care, like a worker who doesn't give a shit about their job.    Interesting. Like being a werewolf is similar to Firestorm, where the wolf side is riding shotgun and the human side is in control, fighting the urges?   What was the point of telling me this? I need help, not snarky asides.   Blood Moon wolves. The only werewolf who can eat other wolves to gain their powers.    Love the idea! It's canon!   The werewolves won't be well known, they're hidden. They exist in the same universe with mages and have a rivalry with them. The wolf monsters could become somewhat stable, but a complete cure couldn't work, the wolf side is too strong to ignore.    I consider the fact that either they become wolf-men monsters or crazy people to be old hat. I want to update werewolf lore. I had the idea of an academy for young werewolves to learn about control, to use their abilities for the good of mankind. I was also wondering about the human side of being a werewolf and how they could use traits like super senses or speed to help take down criminals.     I have. They're an enemy type caused by a magic malfunction.   Hey worldbuilders,  I'm working on a rpg where the player is a new werewolf. I'm wondering, any ideas on how I can make werewolves more interesting in terms of abilities or powers?   If you want a really cool desert city, check out Valia. It's a industrial city run by dark elves hovering above the desert. Entry is around 25 gillions for a gryphon ride up there and you can stay in a luxury resort. Fox-Cliff is only cool to visit for the history and the thieves guild demonstrations, but the nightlife is fantastic. If reading is your idea of a good time, check out the Library of Reality. There, you can check out any kind of book from the multiverse. If magic instrests you, you can go to the Wizard Conservatory and Testing Labratories.    You have my attention.....   I, for one, welcome our new robot overlords.   Science, ladies and gentlemen. The same field that created airplanes and robots.    Felicity and I ducked behind a row of bushes outside the school, hoping that the barbarians didn't see us. Ever since the 'Classification' as people called it, happened, things changed. There was no school system anymore, because everyone was relegated to their class. Mages joined other mages in magic studies and training. Warriors began to work together to protect the streets and develop swords and other weapons. The thieves and rouges began to form guilds and train others in their ways. But some, like me and my friends, worked as a team. Instead of sectioning ourselves off, we joined forces and decided to use our combined abilities to take on quests. Our former math teacher turned Cleric, Mrs. Allison, had given us a new quest. A few mages had taken over the local High School and were performing some dangerous experiments. We'd agreed to the quest and now Felicity and I were scoping out the area.   "I've got two barbarians on the ground in the front of the school." I whispered into a communication rune our mage friend Barry had made. Felicity placed a hand on my shoulder and I looked up and gasped in horror. The front doors had opened and a guy around our age was making his way down the steps, his face hidden by a skull mask.    "Necromancer." I whispered, trying to keep the fear out of my voice. Necromancers were a feared class by everyone. Mages kept their distance and often wouldn't allow necromancers into their training grounds. As a result, Necros as people called them, were outcasts, relegated to living in abandoned buildings. It was a sad fact, but when you can summon zombies, not everyone wants you around. The Necro turned and faced the barbarians. The two warriors looked like they must've been former football players, they were built without an ounce of fat on them. They wore the armor of a mercenary, grey with a red arm band on the left arm, battle axe's at the ready.  "You idiots, the questing party is already here!" he snarled in a high raspy voice. "I scried for them!" He pointed a finger in our direction and launched a ball of blue flame in our direction. I pulled Felicity lower and we both felt the back of our necks become super heated as the ball flew over our heads.   "Open fire!" I heard the familar thwang! of a crossbow string and looked to see Frank, our team's archer, holding his crossbow level; his green hoodie up. I heard a howl of pain and turned to see one of the barbarians on the ground, holding his bloodied knee. Danny and John, our two warriors engaged the other barbarian in combat, screaming like banshees.   "No, no, no!" the necromancer screamed. "Goddamn it, I have to do everything MYSELF!" he screamed, his hands crackling with black lighting. Felicity jumped the bushes and ran towards him, her hands becoming a shade of frosty blue. She flung her fist outward, releasing a shower of icy spikes towards the necromancer, but he acted faster and erected a solid wall of force, shattering the ice. Danny and John had managed to take down the barbarian and were now focusing on the necromancer's shield. Frank's bolts bounced off harmlessly and Felicity's ice magic just slid off.  "It's no good, we can't break it!" Danny shouted, and I grinned. "Stand back! Let me try!" I shouted, drawing out my lute. The necromancer regarded me for a moment and laughed. "What the hell are you going to do with that?" he snarled. I smirked and began plucking the lute strings, weaving the notes with my voice as I began to sing, imagining the two sounds merging as one. Then I screamed as loud as I could, forcing the magic into the shield, completly destroying it. The necromancer was so distracted, my scream had managed to send him flying into a parked car, knocking him unconscious.  John and Danny hoisted the necromancer onto their shoulder after tying him up. "Nice work for a bard." Felicity said jokingly. I chuckled and looked at my lute. "You think I should upgrade?" "Nah, your pretty badass with it." her communication rune vibrated and she squeezed it in her hand.  "New quest guys!" she announced. "An Overlord as been spotted."     Hey World Builders,  Working on a table top RPG about shapeshifters. Any ideas on how I can make different animals with unique abilities for the player?  Here's a link for a post I made describing the world, it's a bit of a wall of text, I apologize: https://www.reddit.com/r/worldbuilding/comments/3d2pci/urban_fantasy_world_with_animal_morphers/   Hey Writers of Reddit,  I'm working on a new story set in a alternate version of the 16th century. Dinosaurs never went extinct, and are used by humans in place of animals like bulldogs, mules, ect. Racial diversity is also different, as slavery happened much earlier in the timeline. As a result, blacks and asians are relatively common in London. Some people have superhuman abilities ranging from psychic to invisibility, but keep them hidden due to persecution from the church. London is the primary setting, and the protagonists are a group of street urchins who are taken in as squires by a rich lord who is funding a trip to the 'New World'. Not sure where to go, any ideas are appreciated.     What do you think about white people who consider themselves Native American due to being 1/14th Cherokee or some other tribe? And how are names given?   Not sure if anyone has thought of this before, but Elon certainly seems like Harrison. Think about all the technology he's introduced over the past couple of years. Paypal, affordable electric cars, believes that humanity has a greater destiny and believes in extraterrestrial life. He also seems to be against artificial intelligence. So what do you guys think?     Hey Redditors,  Working on a new world for a RPG/Book series and wanted to share it! It's still in the planning stages, so any input would be appreciated!  The world is like ours, with modern technology and cities. Some humans called Pookas, have the ability to become one animal at will. When their animal form manifests in early childhood, they are taken to a Pooka Academy to be trained to control their ability. A Pooka's animal form is limited to one animal and so far, only birds and mammals are the only animals they can become. Once their ability is apparent, they become targets for the Altiri, a race of monsterous beings that predated humanity and Pookas.   Magic is also in the universe, but it's similar to the Speedforce. It's apart of a whole, and serious misuse can do a lot of damage. As a result, magic spells are linked to medallions that carry a 'charge' of magic used for a specific spell. For example, a player can use a 'luck enhancement' medallion to alter probability to their favor or a 'fire bolt' medallion to generate a bolt of intense heat. Magic is also used by the Pooka community to cloud the minds of humans if their cover must be broken in public.   Weaponry is typically designed to combat Altiri, such as swords, daggers, axes and hammers, but animal forms are preferred for close range combat. Guns are sometimes used, but aren't all that useful against Altiri and their minions.    The Altiri were, as said before, beings who predated humanity. It is unknown where they came from, but what is known is that they once had immense cities and palaces all around the world. They worshipped great and powerful beings rivaling the Old Ones. But Pooka abilities manifested in early humans, and they drove the proud race underground, erasing all traces of them.   The Altiri come in four flavors,   The Tall Ones: nine foot tall humanoids with white fur, pointed ears and curved horns. They are capable shape shifters and able to mimic humans, often implanting themselves within government ranks. They are largly seen leading armies, hardly fighting hand to hand. They have the biggest distain for humans and Pookas and are very sadistic.  The Durge: Durge's resemble grey skinned humans. They have three toes and glowing yellow eyes without pupils. They are the fighting force of the Altiri and are highly resistant to pain, being able to wade into magma and have no problems. The Durge are simple, but capable of somewhat complex thought, as several Durge's have been noted to simply let an opponent tire themselves out in combat due to the high pain threshold.    The Rot: The Rot, put simply are zombie-like beings with high intellect. They are master strategists with a odd fascination with human technology, noting it's great capacity for destruction. They wear purple and black cloaks at all times, and their left arm is surrounded by fatty tissue.   The Lost Ones: The Lost are being who look like humans, but who's eye are in the wrong places on their bodies. They are rarly seen above ground, but when they are spotted, they lurch around and seem to be in a euphoric state. It is assumed that they are used for slave labor and used to by humans.   That's all I have time for now, but please, ask questions!      My superhero universe is heavily influenced by DC comics and Marvel as well as Hellblazer for the supernatural side. I've got metahumans, mutants, aliens and magic users in every corner of the universe, and that's not counting the Powers of Olympus and Asgard. The superheroes of the universe are similar to the ones on the show Powers, being celebrities and public figures. Sidekicks are seen as a formality, and villains and heroes are seemingly obliged to have young people as either proxies or companions in adventures. I also have a 'Savage Land' expy known as 'The Island', a place where super strong and animal powered villains are housed.  My fantasy world is similar to Discworld, with the ridiculous magic system and crazy characters. The theme of 'the hero has the flu, the janitor or intern's gotta save the world' is a major theme. I've also sprinkled in a dash of Lemoney Snicket's narration and trademark dark humor.   My Science Fiction universe is similar to Korra era Avatar, with a class of humans and Vetari (blue skinned humanoid aliens) with elemental powers.  The technology and style is inspired by Borderlands, with a rustic yet futuristic flare, as is the megacorperations rule over various systems. The protagonist's ability was inspired by DC comic's hero Firestorm.   	37
 * If you're into drug store stuff...Definitely Herbal Essences 'naked' shampoo and conditioner.    * If you use salon stuff, bedhead was always my favorite...S factor smooth/shine products would be perfect from the sounds...All bedhead stuff smells delicious enough to eat as well!    * Andddd, hair gets tangled easier the longer it is...Maybe try to keep it up when exposed to wind etc. That might help a bit as well   She's flaming hot as a ginger. Unff.    It is! :)      Premade Naan Pizza Crust, Garlic butter, and mozzarella cheese!         I'm non customer facing I.T., so I can have studs in my nose and dye in my hair! ^.^   Thank you!! :)   Nice!       Heh! :D   Yeah, that definitely is a happy ending for everyone but him! ;)   Yeah, without a doubt. :(   Welp, what did anyone expect? He was a nazi bastard, its not surprising.    Someone should tell you you're a rude troll and this jewelry can be used for many things that are larger gauge...Yes, including dicks. But, really though? It's a large gauge captive bead barbell...Its not that provocative...    No problem! And that's the worst, sometimes I sneak on my side anyway(I've got 'tragus' dermals, stretched ears etc) and if you get in the perfect middle between two pillows its not too bad. But, its dangerous because sleeping you will fuck it up!    This should be in r/jokes ;P   1.Don't ever use alcohol on it, invest in a good saline solution...(h20 or wound spray) 2. Don't touch or play with it 3.Don't put creams on it 4. Sleep on the other side of your body, back, or face. 5. Keep it really clean! Don't submerge it in pools etc.   Either get a 'fade' in the sense that its shaved more into a layered look or get it thinned into layers if you're not comfortable with being buzzed again...Or like someone else suggested style it. Another option would be to make it wisped with the thinning sheers...like twist the hair and then cut to get a wispy look.   Make it into a fine powder, and force them to snort it? Then hay maker them into oblivion...   Money so I could make it rain on the entire world and space. ;)   Yes, its like a new piercing for the first two weeks after a stretch so being unable to wear jewelry while trying to upsize is nearly impossible.    Pretty sure, however you would probably already know more than me because I have tiny little 00g lobes. lol   I can't lie, I picked up on this as soon as she was introduced...Like, the actress is as well...   You did the thing, thank you kindly!    You're welcome! :)   Now...If he had both that would be even more terrifying.    From box dye to barbie. Nice! :)  	28
 I used to work at Applebees a few years ago. Just be glad today isnt mothers day.   I called some guy a faggot on borderlands just last night for not reviving me, that lead to us having to re-fight the boss.          "Go ahead and try mate, I swear on me mum I'll fuckin clobber ya."   Mainly because ever since the founding of Israel their military has been funded and backed largely by the US.   Absolutely fucking disgusting.    Your linking me to cracked to prove a point.  A podcast on sjwville Cracked.com is what you are using to back up your claims. Amazing stuff.   And oh no your going to spam me because I asked for it? Seems like harrasment to me be careful I might get triggered.  Yet you didn't even touch on any thing I said, instead you immediately jump to linking to a podcast on cracked.   The good things in life demand sacrifice.    I'll believe that when my babys momma is told to pay child support or go to jail, you know like I was.   Or when women are told to sign up at 18 for selective service or go to jail, you know like I was.  Also no one is telling or preventing women from going to work.  The patricary is not stopping women from getting the qualifications needed to get the job. Not one man I know has made it so a woman cannot go into a stem field. Instead women on average choose not too.    Sjw's before it was cool.   BANJOOOOOOOO!   Welcome to hell.   The correct term is now "far right wing republican".   I'm always reminded of this when I read a spaghetti story.  https://youtu.be/dizB1P5z_bk   Kek.   Yup that about sums it up.  Kek.   We need to go deeper.   Chicago. Home of corruption, police black sites and deep dish pizza.  Come for the pizza, stay because a corrupt cop took you to a black site and beat you.   "Go to bed"  "I'm not the one who is cranky ma'am"   I fucking lost it.   That's part of the problem, these cops are able to ruin people's day over the slightest vehicle infraction. Subject to fines and even jail time if they don't pay those fines. The general public is required too follow all the laws but these cops don't have to, and as the video shows when confronted with his own illegal activity the cop resorts to running away and callng up his boys to come threaten and intimate.   How do you think a cop would react if the roles where reversed? If a cop tryed to pull someone over and instead that person ran home, then sent his friends to confront the cops. That person and his friends would be shot and killed. All in the name of "officer safety"   If the police are going to be the long arm of the law then they sure as fuck should know the law. Its not my fault and its not the laws fault, it is entirely that cops fault he is driving something he shouldn't be. Which brings me back to my original comment of "ignorance of the law is no excuse, unless your a cop"  Also didn't mean to imply you are a cop or anything.   Ignorance of the law is no excuse.  Unless your a cop that is.   And how is lil DrThundercockMD junior doing?   The house of leaves.    Parasite Eve is a pretty cool game.    Oh she will be pumped. Don't you worry.  ( ~  )     That's weird, Solas never talked about that part of the fade. With him its all spirits and dreaming.   The concept of love.   "You don't want to have sex with a poc demikin trans womyn!? You are a racist sexist transmisogynist shitlord."   Holy shit $500 for being a hack writer!? I really need to start a patrion and a blog.    Tomorrow :)   I'm sure glad our infrastructure and social programs are crumbling so we can keep giving Israel billions. Such good little goys we are.   NYPD IS CORRUPT!?!?  I am shocked, shocked I say.   "Wellum first I took the pills and went plop plop, the I gave her the ol surprise puppin pop."   $2.99 for a costume here we come.   I like TB and the best friends.  Deal with it nerds.   Draw up a picture of a gator playing games and post it, obviously.   Gr8 b8, m8. I rel8, str8 appreci8, and congratul8. I r8 this b8 an 8/8. Plz no h8, I'm str8 ir8.

Even with a full pl8, I always have time to communic8 so don't hesit8.   YOU CANT FLUB THE STUB!   What the fuck did you just fucking say about me, you little bitch? Ill have you know I graduated top of my class in the Navy Seals, and Ive been involved in numerous secret raids on Al-Quaeda, and I have over 300 confirmed kills. I am trained in gorilla warfare and Im the top sniper in the entire US armed forces. You are nothing to me but just another target. I will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of spies across theUSAand your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. Youre fucking dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and thats just with my bare hands. Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the United States Marine Corps and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little clever comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldnt, you didnt, and now youre paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it. Youre fucking dead, kiddo.   Gotta give it to the superior officer he handleded that perfectly. He asked the rookie if he had any RAS and when he didn't he let him go. Good stuff all in all.   But can you shit post?   He's got two hookers, an eight ball of crack and a dream to take over Uganda. He has to free up some time to make it happen.   Your a big guy.   I had that same fire banner on my geo city page.    Haaaaaay indeed.   rekt   How big are said penises?    I'm raising her and have been since day one, with no child support or help from her mother.   Aya is four now and she's awesome.    A better gift would of been laxatives.    https://youtu.be/Nb20VpWGocw   I still have a tape cassette single of lil waynes tha block is hot.  My knee hurts sometimes.   Wait a minute, 2011?  I seem to remember a "MISSION ACCOMPLISHED" banner before then.   "They can see for themselves what a society that guarantees human rights is really like," Pyongyang said in statement.  Welp looks like I'm moving.  Wish me luck guys.   And he will say "Hello", then go back home.   Good. The family deserves their day in court and not a payout from the tax payers of NY.   And just like that a shitlord gets their wings.   Just a few quick things.   The war on drugs is a failure.   No one should be in any legal trouble for cannabis.   When a swat team does a raid every officer should have a body cam.  Don't have guns if your a felon.   I don't think it would be smart to dox cops on reddit. Plus I'm sure the mods/admins wouldn't want me doing that.   Your a pretty cool guy NL. Now do it again with only using the force.   Jesus Christ.

And as far as I know not in any state is it a law that you have to carry ID. Minus driving that is.  Open and concealed carry laws vary from state to state.   Back home in Ohio it was "The open-carry of firearms by those who legally possess the firearm is a legal activity in Ohio with or without a license". But you needed a CCW to conceal carry.

Now if we are talking about remaking P1/2 I'm so in.   I agree, but you are missing out on some important things here.   If the cops don't use these toys they lose them. The whole problem is police departments nationwide have to keep the numbers on the war on drugs high so that they get more funding from the state/fed.   So to keep getting more cash into the department, military grade weapons and tactical equipment is used on non-violent people for drugs. War on drugs "wins" go up, more money for departments, more money for the courts and jails.   It goes without saying that most if not all of these failed and harmful policies (stop and frisk, civil forfeiture, no-knock raids) that not only violate rights and put officers in danger, all strem from a failed war on drugs.    "Kinda" weird.   GG leader here.  This made me happy. Thanks guys.   Well they sorta remade Zelda one and halfway through turned it into Seasons (I think thats the right one).

Then I get sad, and then I realise that Pat has won.  Fuckin Pat   Its almost like there is a different set of rules for law enforcement in our country.

It lays out the core mechanics in a way that is accessible and easy to understand.    Good.   I just want one person too come out and tell the truth about why they oppose gay marriage.   Not the buzzwords like "children" "states rights" or "muh bible" I want one person to just say "I don't want the fags getting married because I am a bigot who thinks gays are disgusting."  I sure as hell wouldn't agree with them but I'd respect them telling the truth. However wrong and hatefull that "truth" is.   Because Hannity is a lil bitch who doesn't back up what he says.   I know right, what the hell is up with these humans on reddit caring about human rights? Its insanity I tell ya, pure insanity.

             This is one of the more unintelligent sentences I've read on Reddit ever. Great job.      Smith and I parted ways with Jersey Girl. I'm keeping it that way.   The fact that he's "new" isn't an issue to me I want to see what he plans to DO. He needs to release a game plan and pledge to stick to it. Would also like to know his position on Israel and what he plans on doing to address the banks. I'm not voting for the guy yelling fire. I know there is a fire. I want the guy who says here is how I'm putting it out.   Youv want recognition for this? For being an adult? I find this highly insulting. Seriously, you need to rethink what constitutes heroism in life, because marginalizing women and making tiny bullshit like this look like some sort of accomplishment demeans every single woman who actually achieves a recognition-worthy accomplishments around the world.   If someone does either to me, I'm going straight to Bobbit tactics.      I think I would. Why not? I might even manage to do some good for the world on my way out :)   Too many rules, too much sensitivity and virtually no subscribers. A good concept dying from over regulation and knee jerking.

                Keep em coming, appreciate the effort!              Oh noes, my precious wee one has to suffer because I can't double park against a car which is parked on broken yellow lines while I hold up the traffic behind me while I open the door for my princess.   If you have limited funds perhaps something reliable may be better... I have a 2005 1800cc caldina you'd pick one up around that, great wagon, feed her 98 and she's away laughing.   Plenty of guts to cruise at 110 on motorway, even on the infamous Dunedin kilmog.   Gets around 550km /tank for around a hundred bucks around town.   Mazda's command a high price in Japan, so they tend to be more expensive than worth it.   And if something the doctors had given him that interacted badly with the cannabis oil he could have died. But hey, she got her ulterior motive firmly in the spotlight, so whatever right?  No. For the same reason you don't mix alcohol with sleeping tablets, you don't just self medicate after trusting the professionals to do their damn job, how incredibly insulting of her to undermine their ability to treat her son by giving him her own medication!?  If I were her doctors I would be absolutely livid this woman potentially put my career on the line for her own selfish agenda.   Whatever it is, Greece has fucked their citizens for many years, their young will leave in droves, who wants to support their country if their country cannot support themselves?    And how do you know the people writing the laws are in bed with those who  want disproportionate sentences for petty crime? Ah, unjust prison sentences! Beautiful.   Fucking pathetic paedophile loving little fucktards.          At the very least it would require them to land immediately and run system checks. I understand they're designed to ingest carcasses and water, but ideally not flammable metal and batteries!  Edit: they can't land full, so need to eject water and fuel before landing, hence wasted trip.    Ok, then perhaps I was too harsh! I apologise. My wife's come home with some horrible stories -neighbors at war when 1 neighbour brings in "absolutely feral cat" and the next day they find out they knew it was a loved cat, but hated cats so stole it and took it to the spca anyway...    It's funny, my partner used to work for the SPCA and if she had a dollar for every time someone said that, and it turned out to be a loved pet..   Did you put up flyers at all?   Put a notice in your local supermarket?   Knock on the doors of your neighbors?   Edit: they checked with the neighbors so I was out of place chastising them! Removed comment as totally unfair and uncalled for sorry op!       The LIPO /lithium ion batteries for a start are explosive when punctured, and the hundreds of high grade aluminium/steel parts would wreak an engine spinning at a few thousand rpm's.   Then factor in like a go pro as well with a second battery as well as everything else and it'll certainly involve landing instantly to confirm damage!    Fully, they will have no-one else to blame either!    Yeah man, one of those sucked into the air intakes and you're toast!       I'll happily pick up 99% of spiders I see in the house and take them outside. Whitetails get the boot. Every time.

E.g everyday driving, right up to specialised speed related activities like flying aircraft/car racing etc.  How are our eyes able to cope with a significantly higher demand than our environment has ever placed on it for millions of years of evolution?   You're a real catch you next Tuesday.      Business are criminal these days, you cannot justify a 15% pay rise (and that's excluding  (660k of 4.18M$) as "Market rates" since when the fuck did "Market rates" become the go-to excuse for eye watering astronomical salaries?  Your salary should reflect your ability to do a job (he says with a laugh). I know better than that, and I know we're not in an ideal world. Simple fact is keep the shareholders happy and they will ensure you get whatever you want in terms of payment.   The Business world is built upon: You scratch my back, I'll scratch yours.      This is the first I've heard of it in NZ, it hasn't been on our news radar at all.               Indeed, the whole cycle perpetuates itself - the last straight car runs the red, causing the right turn people to feel like they deserve to run the red.   The thing is it's beyond people just being cheeky and running the orange, they're fully entering the intersection when the lights are red/have been red for a few seconds. Which is just bloody dangerous..   And looking to the right panel we see..:  32 points (70% upvoted)  Yip way to prove OP's point guys. Well played.   Uhm. What?   There are methods available to her to liquidate the equity in her home, but that would eat into the entitled little shits inheritance.  Honestly, she has more worth than I am likely to ever see in my lifetime, would there have been the same sob story if it was a middle aged couple struggling to pay the mortgage?  At least she gets the pension from the government, try getting help as a struggle middle class!   I appreciate your take on this, I wish I had half your optimism! Thanks!    Indeed, you've noticed that too?? -Rain brings out the dicks!  But yes, the right turn is especially bad for red light runners.   Ah, Chch, makes perfect sense. I have encountered said Neanderthal on occasions.   Usually preceeded by "Have you got a ciggy bro?" (Or a couple dollars for the bus.) When I inevitably say no, it's the same thinly veiled aggressive response.   I feel like saying:  "Dafaq cunt? Was your family so incredibly dysfunctional you weren't taught the basics of how to to talk and interact with humans?  However it ends up come out like:   "..Mumblesomethingunintelligible.."  .. I am not a strong man and have no desire to be stabbed.   lol! Oh dear, freudian slip perhaps?   Not an isolated incident, but was just out for a walk down Clarence Street.  Some fucking holier than thou cunt in a new 4x4 something turned right (From Clarence to Blenheim) a couple seconds after the red as the "Cross" symbol was green and I'd started walking.  Next time, I'll fucking kick your car ya cunt.  Seriously though, what the hell is with Chch people and their inherent fuck the lights attitude?!?    NZ is definitely without a doubt one of the more desirable countries to own property in.   I think had it not been for the Chch EQ's and subsequent WLG EQ that people would probably be investing more.  I mean some of the beach front properties in Redcliff's sold for a fraction of what a similar beachfront property sells for overseas.  Above it all, the human population is always growing, however the amount of habitable land is constant. This alone is enough to have the price increase.   There was a glut in the market, there's now not a glut. Economics 101.  Did they honestly think the supply would never catch up with demand?         "National MPs, 40 of whom own investment properties, are unlikely to take the view that house-price inflation is a bad thing."   *But that doesn't constitute a conflict of interest. /s*   Can confirm, popped into Dev - running apps and Snapchat is running at full 2 x 2.2GHZ for like 5 minutes after running on GS5.  Fucking annoying having to force kill it.  SORT YOUR FUCKING SHIT OUT CUNTS.  EDIT: THEY FUCKING UPDATED IT AND IT'S STILL FUCKING BROKEN! CPU @ 80% AFTER LOADING SNAPCHAT!?   * Check your tyre pressure - Most tyres run 32 PSI. You can run higher (I run mine at 38 PSI) but you will get a bumpier ride. You can normally find your tyre pressure by the Drivers side door latch. (When you open the door, look at the latch mechanism beside your hip and there may be a sticker denoting your PSI/KPI levels)  * If you're driving in a straight line, and you let go of the wheel, does the car noticeable lurch/start to turn itself to either the left/right in a very noticeable way? Then your wheel alignment is out, and this will be causing uneven wear on your tyres.  * If you don't want to fork out around 70-100 dollars for a wheel alignment, then you can put it off by rotating your tyres - from front right to rear left, front left to rear right and vice versa. (Note: ensure the direction arrows on the sidewall are adhered to!)  * Buy fuel when it's as cold as possible, (first thing in the day, or at night.) fuel expands as it gets hot, as as you pump per litre rather than weight you can save *maybe a litre* over a tank just by topping up during the coldest point of the day.  * 91 vs 95/98* honestly 99% of the time you're not going to notice the difference. I've found on a long journey at 100km/h then I did get an extra 50km from 98 (over a 650km tank) compared to 91 with a 2005 Toyota Caldina. But that advantage would quickly be pissed away as around town the vast majority of your energy is accelerating, in which case the difference isn't so pronounced. Therefore if you're looking save cash 95/98 isn't going to help you!  *I think this question alone sparked the phrase "YMMV" (Your Mileage May Vary) lol.      No I simply got interrupted. But thanks for the assumption. I'm sure I could find a study where finding racism in things that aren't racist is also racist?    If the N1 is anything to go by, hopefully they'll lean towards Android!            It's extremely complicated.  You've got a variety of market forces and different brackets at play which makes for a clusterfuck of opinions.  In one corner you've got the folk who own property in the hot spots, and are watching their investment grow an enviable $1000's of dollars a month.  In another corner you've got the simple fact that people of asian descent dominate our property auctions.   And another coincidence is this perception is further amplified by the "top sales people" in most realtors again of Asian descent. After 4 years in retail I can say without an iota of racism that Asians buy almost exclusively from Asian salespeople. I've had customer's who walk up to the nearest asian looking sales person and exclusively buy from them. If there were none available, **they would actually have the balls to ask if there were any asian sales people and leave if there weren't!!**.  You've got the devout labour supporters who are simply following the leader by crying foul with the latest stats simply because they have an interest in getting rid of National and supporting Labour.  You've got National Supporters who again are just crying foul because the allegations came from Labour and are loving the racist card in all of this, which is course a giant side show and detracting from Labour's primary message of "Foreign home Ownership" rather than just a good old Chinese bash-up like National are desperately trying to depict.  You've got Labour themselves who are trying desperately to stay relevant in the facing of falling poll results and are willing to post ANYTHING controversial to try and sway the voters by posting potentially defamatory statements against Asians by pigeon-holing people by their last names in an attempt to pull on the public's very hot topic of house prices (Obviously not who are in the first category of watching their investment grow however)  And you've got the young and old or homeless/renters who are rapidly coming to the realisation that no matter what their dream of owning a home is being dashed.  Whether or not they believe it due to foreign home ownership they just know the National Bank are very very very happily fucking them over with a deep heated coated broom handle by instating LVR resrictions, despite the fact I'd bet my left nut the Banksknow damn well it's the overseas buyers an speculators who are driving up houses prices, but they that's ok because the Bank are still making money hand over fist!  The Government knows damn well there's a problem with speculators and developers (hence the half hearted attempt at a capital gains tax they implemented earlier this year.) however their unwillingness to even look at a register of foreign home buyers should actually show you how desperate they are for the truth not to come out - that our country is very much up for the highest bidder, and the cashed up people are buying up WORLD WIDE and this is affecting the Kiwi's ability to buy a house.  All in all, there's a fucking massive problem, our government are burying their head in the same, our young are being fucked hard with the rising cost of living, coupled with a government who don't give a fuck about keeping jobs on shore, and parents who constantly try and apply their own morals to their offspring without either giving a fuck, or honestly believe it's possible to own your home on your average wage by the time you're 30.  /rant/    How the fuck can you go 9 months living as a freedom camper!?   Often licked never beaten      Awesome, thanks man! I understand, I have a Nikon Dslr and photographing one would be just a satisfying   How did you find out about this? It's on my bucket list to the see the Aurora Australis here in Chch.      The fuck are you on about?       Ah. Nasty. That sucks   TIL Cilantro is another name for coriander!  But that's tough, especially as most of those must be used in a considerable amount of flavourings/foods as an enhancer.   What happens if you do?      Why should people bother to graduate then?   You get a higher education to show employers that you're head and shoulders above your peers and have shown enough interest to get off your ass and learn more about your chosen profession.   If your employers (like this one) doesn't respect that, move on to the next one.   It's unprofessional of Employers to bitch about paying people a decent wage and then complain there's no one they can hire who's willing to work for a pittance. It's very hypocritical.   How can she honestly defend the stupid fuck who is a recidivist offender who feels he is above the law. Over 100 demerits means the little shit broke the law often enough to know better.   And I daresay his mother feeds the pricks sense of entitlement. All I can say is it's really better to shut the fuck up and look stupid, than to open your mouth and remove all doubt.   Edit: I give it about a month before he's caught again (because the other tickets obviously didn't stop him) and the cops look up his record, find this shit and throw the book at every single little minor indiscretion they can find. And more power to them in this instance.   Agree. KitKat on S5 was 5-6hours SOT w/ 13hours total. Lollipop (Fresh install) is 3-4hours SOT with 13 hours total. (And that's with ALL Samsung and MOST of the Google (Books/Movies etc Disabled)   Fully understand, I was just pulling those figures from the websites I found, but yeah you can live with others, or even a partner. :)   Shit, fucked that up. Sorry I'll fix it. Thanks, still negative, but not by so much. And in the past week, dunedin has been sitting on a high of 8degC.   Perhaps not to bad over summer, but it will probably average around 40-50pw year round. (And this is all presuming you're flatting by yourself) It may be cheaper/more expendy depending on your habits, but again that's without insurance, cellphone, landline or internet bills..   This coming from the softcock (who will ~~probably~~ hopefully read this.) who [blamed NZ internet](http://www.stuff.co.nz/technology/games/68677940/game-developer-dean-hall-says-new-zealand-broadband-in-the-dark-age) on the inability to run a company in NZ. It's like seriously? You think you're the ONLY NZ company to have this same problem, so you go running to the media and actually **threatening** to take the work overseas.   And now the cunt actually has the balls to try and hire immigrant anyway!?   He's just an outspoken asshole who's apparently looking to bag NZ in any way shape or form he can!?  **You can't refuse to pay market rates to our budding game developers, and then complain there are no game developers. You fucking hypocritical douche bag.**  Dude, GROW THE FUCK UP. Stop running to the media with your problems, if you have a problem with NZ stop being an asshole, blaming everything you can and threatening to take the jobs overseas. Honestly we're better off without you.  * [For the record with a student loan](http://www.salaries.co.nz/a/salary-tax-calculator/) $35,000 is $27,437 pa cash in hand. * [Average Rent in Dunedin](http://www.enz.org/house-rents-dunedin.html) 350pw is 18,200 pa. * Weekly grocery shop (Roughly): 100pw is 5200 pa. * Weekly power (This is Dunedin, so this is an underestimate!): 50pw 2600 pa. * Weekly petrol in a very cheap car: 35pw is 1820 pa.  **And you get $-383.. Without insurance, internet, landline or cellphone bills**    So either that's not a 'living wage' or you will at the least be barely scraping the barrel to survive off that salary! That's not a reasonable wage for someone (who's doing skilled work even breaking into the industry), and it's hardly surprising that he's not able to get any staff!      It's simple. Work for the highest hourly wage ever.  Step 1. Get a fine.  Step 2. Repeat step 1.  Step 3. Go to court for unpaid fines.  Step 4. Get community service in exchange for fines.  Step 5. ???  PROFIT!!!!!!  Seriously, I know people who have worked for THOUSANDS of dollars AN HOUR wiped off their fines.  It's a fucking joke.      For the record: [from the article] "Currently, about a third of all CEFC investments involve small-scale solar. The corporation, which has produced more than a $1 profit for the government for every $1 invested, was assessing $500 million in finance for solar projects valued at more than $1 billion. There are 1.3 million rooftop solar systems in Australia and most households receive publicly-backed rebates to install, but the CEFC has made a priority projects that help people who do not own their own homes, those who live in apartments and community groups to invest in solar"  So in short they helped mum and dad install a solar panel or two in order to help with the energy bill. Not any longer.   What the actual fuck? How can they justify this?!          And can I say: what a fucking fool. [Wind Energy is one of the cheapest forms of renewable energy. And for a country with ailing mining industry you would have thought they would be embracing other forms of energy!?](http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/oct/13/wind-power-is-cheapest-energy-unpublished-eu-analysis-finds)      I fully understand! There are kiwis (Asian, European, Maori) who are all in the same barrel. However it's specifically overseas cashed up buyers, for whom money is no object and they want a safe haven/some way to basically get cash out of the country.   You have to wonder how though, they're actually very restricted as to how much cash cash flow out of China, look it up. So if they're cash sales there's likely something dodgy going on.  But it's not just China, with our houses literally up for ANY nationality to buy then anyone who's got the bare minimum is always going to be up against tough competition.    Argh, my son is fucked in terms of buying a house. As my mate lamented the other day, even a couple on over a 100,000 pa income struggle to save enough to buy, then service a home loan. It's pathetic, we're literally prisoners in our own economy. I don't give a flying fuck if those old fucks are making mega dollars on their 2000 they bought back in 1967 cause realistically that doesn't go into the fucking economy, it goes back to some private property investor fat cat who currently doesn't pay tax on that income. So tell me more how it benefits me (a 28yo male)? It doesn't!   Fuck the foreign buyers, especially fuck the banks for being greedy cunts, causing the property crisis by loaning money to people who couldn't pay it back (you know the middle class who haven't had a pay rise in years, while ceo's and other fat cats line their pockets with the proceeds of the effort of these people but I digress), then further fucking over the middle class by allowing foreign buyers preference over first home buyers with their LVR restrictions, and I'm just waiting till the government blames first home buyers on the prices flying upwards, just wait it will happen! It already has over in Australia!  Edit: If you're going to downvote me, tell me how I've got it wrong? What do you not like about my comment? Don't just anonymously disrespect my opinion without at least telling me why.  Edit: And more downvotes without saying why. Of course my elders who own houses are thoroughly enjoying this, their house prices are inevitably increased which is good for them, however they either don't care, or are blind to the problems facing **their** sons and daughters.    So.. if Gerry had openly refuted the claims, had the dinner in an open and honest manner declaring everything along the way with nothing to hide I wouldn't have had a problem, neither would have anyone else.   It was only 1 guy complaining from presumably quite a large list of people he invited.  The ultimate question is did he really have to cancel an entire sponsored dinner (probably at great cost to the booking fee etc) over 1 sour man accusing him of being cohorts with the company who won the contract over him?   Or did the guy make him realise it actually maybe wasn't a good look, and could appear as a conflict of interest, so cancelled it, while blaming the guy as a scapegoat?   I'm leaning towards the latter, judging by his outburst flying off at the guy about it.   Well, that's exactly my argument.   For instance in the IT world you never just go with the biggest company, as smaller companies can sometimes respond to your needs faster and be more open to ideas!    Sorry, I should explain! They charged the restocking fee on a mate who bought from them, a Maximum VII Hero, and a Samsung M.2 SSD. the Maximus doesn't accept SATA M.2's (not that you could tell from the specs!) and so he had to return it, and they demanded a 35% cut of a $300 dollar item, and he swapped it out with a SATA SSD.  He should have argued it, as really he bought every other component from them as he told the retailer his purpose (by having every single component for a PC in his cart) that he was building a PC and that the HDD he had selected was not compatible with that motherboard. Therefore the item was not fit for purpose.  It's a bit of a gray area, but I reckon he should have argued they didn't warn him when boxing the components, or even have it explicitly state that while the motherboard has an M.2 slot it does not accept SATA based M.2 drives, only PCIe based M.2 drives. (Confused yet?)  However he didn't argue and just took the $100 whack to his wallet!   It's not corruption, as /u/nightform has informed me, they are one of the biggest companies, and the market is geared towards security in size. So it's like a snowball effect. They are just so big they collect the contracts, as there are very little competition/none at that level.   They don't *just* switch parts, they take a hefty fucking 35% cut as a "restocking fee".   I fully understand, and you make complete sense.       I found [this from 2009 which doesn't mention offices.](http://transportblog.co.nz/2009/08/24/minimum-parking-requirements/)  And [this from 2015 from indicate there are NO parks required in Chch at all ""It's hard to understand why I am not required one car park but by law I am required to put 38 bicycle parks in my building," he said" which is from one of the main men behind the Chch rebuild](http://www.stuff.co.nz/the-press/news/67535988/Car-park-shortage-could-stall-Christchurch-development)  If that is the case then it against confirms the council are bunch of arsehole ignoramuses.   I see what you're saying, but to a layman you're setting yourselves up to fail when you continually award every single large project to the same company.  No company is beyond corruption as the Public found out about [Projenz](https://www.sfo.govt.nz/n494,27.html) not so gracefully last year. And no company is too big to fail either, which would leave Chch people extremely in the lurch as most of the work going on is with the same company. That to me just doesn't make sense.  I have however seen some things in the past few months that have really opened my eyes into how contracts are awarded and Gerry's response to something he must be accused of on a weekly basis just doesn't pass muster.   I understand what you're saying, they are one of (if not) the biggest construction company in NZ.  However (to me anyway) the whole point of tender is to ensure the work is done by the ~~best~~cheapest not whoever's the biggest.   Just saying they got it because they have no competition is a bit silly as you're kinda resigning the industry to ensuring they're their own worst enemy by continually giving work to one company on the basis of well they are the biggest..   However above all he's a Politician for goodness sake, and grown man who should be able to stick by his decisions.  Furthermore, had he not cancelled it, this more than likely would have been a non-event. However, by cancelling the event, after having invited journalists he knew very well (or his PR team should have told him..) that this was going to get more scrutiny than warranted.  The accusations being thrown at him by someone who lost an extremely lucrative contract so of course they are going to be pissed about it, and say stupid things. However he really didn't need to respond like this.   Exactly. If everything stacked up to scrutiny, why would he throws his toys from the cot like a petulant child? Not the actions of an innocent man.   You know how to look guilty as sin? Act like a twat when someone accuses you of doing something that looks like favouritism.  "He labelled the insinuation "unacceptable" and cancelled the drinks."  No improper relationship there ay?  Let's look at what Fletchers have been awarded..  * [$300M Anchor project](http://www.fletcherconstruction.co.nz/news.php? action=viewnews id=444) * [$800 million East and North Frame residential precinct](http://collaboratecanterbury.org.nz/news/fletcher-residential-awarded-east-and-north-frame/) * [EQR Contract (worth probably billions)](http://www.eqr.co.nz/qa)  And then you have the other work they've been awarded..  * [Fletchers awarded $260M Canterbury university work (as part of the Government support package, so I wonder who really awarded them this?)](https://www.nzx.com/companies/UOC/announcements/262127)  Fletchers OWN Canterbury construction work and you really wonder why people are pissed off?        Exactly. I appreciate 99% of houses down south, even on the shores of lake Tekapo etc are still weatherboard on piles and can get very very very very cold.   Yes, you're right, but it's not much the lack of support from the businesses, bear in mind 99% of them don't own the land, rather lease it. And those who lease it only buy what's available.  This needs to be addressed with a building code change - for X amount of people the building can hold, Y% must be available for parking.  However as I've pointed out before, what sounds better?   "For Sale $1M Office building fits 500 staff, 300 car parks." "For Sale $1.3M Office building fits 900 staff."  The latter of course, therefore in order to get as much profit from their developments they don't want a minimum carpark allowance, therefore as developers are well and truely one of the biggest campaign boosters this will not happen.  So long story short, council is being an ass. Developers force the problem to the council. And the little guy loses. Once again.   Not really, it's the developers who are allowed to make maximum profit by having increased desk space without the need to include car parking in their plans. I mean being able to create a brand new office that fits 200 staff, but only creating enough parks for 10% of those staff only move the problem on to the streets.   Or council and government have cemented our dependence upon cars when they constantly reject light rail.    It's a very one sided argument.   You can't say you're punishing someone unfairly without saying why they're being punished to begin with.   It's 2 weeks of footage wrapped up into a neat 43 minute package designed for an hour of tv.   We see what the producer wants us to see. They clearly think drama and bullying sells.   The truly disappointing thing is from the synopsis  It's a great idea, just really frustrating they're trivializing the struggle depicted by the many colourful people who they meet by leaving so much of it on the cutting floor to make way for this bullshit   It's really disappointing.    The popularity of crowdfunding things like this is stupid people will forego insurance thinking they can just pull the same trick, but it doesn't work like that..   There's no mention of what he was actually put away for..   Amazon give away a couple hundred dollars worth of apps every other month. So yes, they do pay you.      Yes... At the moment Chch's nights around -2 - +3 degC.  Our days are around 7-15degC. Most houses are single glazed, wooden structures on piles, so the wind just whips any heat away almost instantly.            Yay! That's excellent. Also: "Smoke alarms would be compulsory from July." how are they NOT compulsory already!? Oh well another win for the little guy anyway!      I would agree with you if Samsung weren't a pack of fuckwits who love crippling their old hardware by refusing to update the software suite. For instance, shit like Themes, or Camera2 api support should have been released for the s5, but Samsung, being the pile of cunts they are have chosen to deliberately save those for the newer devices, despite stuff like themes being device agnostic.   It's a real pity, cause there was a guy down Lincoln/Moorhouse who was just doing it to supplement the DPB.   But then you get the fucks who steal the Servo's washers and just cold water and a bucket.   Well they've gone and ruined it for themselves. Little arrogant fucktards.      I know the corner, pretty mint.    Very muchly, I agree WLG were gimped from the start, but having spent a week there recently they aren't doing too badly with what they've got.  On the other hand, getting from Riccarton Avenue for instance to the carpark beside the bus Exchange, you have to go through about 5 set of lights, and cross at least 3 lanes of traffic (at a time.) which is nearly impossible for someone who doesn't 100% know where they're going. Which is stupid, road's should be intuititive and easy to use.    Are we talking about the same Country? [TVNZ reported Nearly 250,000 drivers were stung over December and January for driving at speeds up to the usual tolerance of 10kmh over the limit. Resulting in 7.3M$ taken](https://www.tvnz.co.nz/one-news/new-zealand/lower-tolerance-nets-4650-increase-in-speeding-fines-6303942.html)   Thank you! Exactly. They can't just tout a lower reduced tolerance as a crash reduction parameter, while it may be a factor, it's one of many in regards to whether people crash.   I get it, speeding past a school = dangerous. Speeding (~110) on the open road when in a passing lane = acceptable behaviour  However while they do they do the occasional blitz outside schools, I've personally only seen a speed camera van down fendalton road on a monthly basis. Never once have I seen a police presence outside Burnside highschool, despite the fact I drive past daily when parents are dropping their kids off.    Indeed! It's hell with "No turn" signs everywhere. The 1 way system works for pedestrians, not so much for cars.   So people can's just slam on the brakes past the speed cameras. That's quite a good idea (from a scientific point of view.)  Does it work though?   "try to limit the amount of intersections" No one told that to Chch city builders......   True. I have too little faith in the greed of those of those who control the cameras that that they will be able to resist the extra potential income forever.   I'll try it out!   I traditionally have attempted to use screencast to get some videos to play, but most detect you're using an "HDMI out" and refuse to play, citing HDCP protection.   I agree, but cars and drivers don't/can't just slam on the brakes to go the posted sign limit if the system thinks that now's a good time to change it to 60.   I can only hope there will be a buffer zone - e.g. the system waits a second before pinging people for speed, as people who go past it right as it changes from 60-40 but have no hope of physically seeing the sign change.  I know it's a rare situation, but there's a lot of potential for abuse from the operators to change the speed and ping people immediately.   Fair. Sorry Reddit.      OP, you have a lot of grease on your cellphone screen, this is causing your piss poor photo. Give it a wipe with a soft glasses lens cloth.   I wouldn't mind if it snowed, or rained. Fuck this ice shit.  	132
 It's the original hardcover from January 1996, but the words "First Edition" aren't on the copyright page. What does the number line mean? Can I tell which print it is? Would it technically be a "First Edition # Print? It's never even been read, if it's a much later print, why did he sign it? Thanks in advance.      I just got this, definitely signed but I don't know if it's authentic, or first edition or what. Sorry if wrong subreddit, here's the album: http://imgur.com/a/PrW43   It actually is, you complete fucking retard, because they give you the new email address immediately after you email them at the old one.... Which is exactly how you got the new address yourself.   Are you honestly that stupid?   Your daddy shoulda shot you Into the fucking toilet, for real. I feel bad for everybody who ever has to interact with you or your offspring even one time in their fucking life.  Do earth a favor...go smother your kids and then shoot yourself.   HEY EVERYBODY, THEIR EMAIL IS WEBSUPPORT@RCFOR.ME                FUCK THIS FUCKIN GUY   Post a pic, you stupid Asshole.   TIIIITITITITITI   Hey bub, that's my aim, you see.   You are one scrupulous nigger.    Good question.            Put a fat drop on your dildo and slide it right up your asshole.   Dunno why you got downvoted, kratom is better than anything they're going to give him/her.   Did he blow his leg off cooking dope?   Rcfor.me much?   Your stupid fucking counselor doesn't know the difference between "your" and "you're"? He shouldn't even have that fucking job.   This shit is so fucking weird   Around here they call them "goosebumps".  Psycho.   Pretty sure it was probably priority. Why?   Have no fear, dude is legit, I got my order a couple day ago.   By the way, I know all about the withdrawals. Hands down worst withdrawals of my life. Those are the kinds of withdrawals they portray in movies (Ray, Trainspotting, Johnny Cash). In movies they're always exaggerated like crazy... but now I'm beginning to think the directors of those movies are just fentanyl addicts.  I've only had acetyl fentanyl once, about 700 mg, and every time after that I've gotten butyr fentanyl instead.... and for some reason acetyl fentanyl is way way way fuckin worse. IDK why. Doesn't make much sense to me, but it definitely without a doubt is. I couldn't even go to work on acetyl withdrawals.... I can't do anything the first day except lay in bed and shiver and shake uncontrollably... butyr doesn't come close to making me do that, and I can go to work on butyr too, although I'm not the most productive on those days, lol.     You remember how much it was by any chance? Am I allowed to ask that? lol   Butyr is 4 time less potent than fentanyl, acetyl is 15, but other than that, i'd have to say the effects are still the same. I prefer butyr fent by far, since my most frequent  ROA is vaping and acetyl fent just requires vaping too much powder.   Unfortunately I couldn't compare the duration between acetyl and butyr because as I said above, I can't smoke acetyl.... therefore I ended up snorting it, and I will say that snorted acet does last longer than vaped butyr, but that's to be expected with most anything when vaped vs. snorted, no?   I'm not asking where to find butyr fentanyl on Agora, I'm just curious as to whether anybody has ever seen it on there? I've seen tons of acetyl, but I've personally never seen butyr on there, or any other market, for that matter.   I'm sure it's there, you just gotta find the right people. Tons of people are probably shake and baking. and I'm sure at least a few are doing anhydrous cooks. Your best bet would be to find the anny cooks, because although shake and bake can be decent, most don't know how to do it right. Anny cooks generally have a better understanding of what they're doing. Forget about finding ice though. You'll have to hit up the darknet for that, son. Whatever you decide to do, don't start cooking it.   Acetyl fentanyl is 6% as potent as fentanyl. Butyr fentanyl is 25% as potent as fentanyl. So if acetyl fentanyl is being sold for 60 bucks a g, then butyr fentanyl should be somewhere in the range of 240 a g, correct?   So, go to whichever site you're looking at and compare the prices. The acetyl fent is generally the one that's always priced worse, bang for your buck wise.   I used 50% vinegar. 50% water and let it sit 5 to 10 minutes. Stir and it's good to go. Use extremely minimal heat if needed.   Also, fuck acetyl, get you some butyr, son.   You can request to have the signature waived. I request it every time for EMS packages and 3 out of 4 were delivered without signature, the fourth one i had to pick up and sign for because of some shit with the computer. The guys at rchem.org have to write "waive signature" on the waybill though, so you need to ask them about it.   I know they can test for it at the lab, but has anybody ever actually seen an instant dip-style test for it? Either online or in real life?   The dipstick shows it to be a bit above the full line, the oil capacity is 4.3 quarts, I'd say I probably put in about 4.7-4.8 quarts. Should I not even worry about it? Or should I just drain a little? Is there an easy way to do that without draining all the oil and putting it back in? Should I just loosen the drain plug and let a little out? Thanks in advance.   So, how was it?   You accidentally said "suffocate" instead of "insufflate" in your original post, son.   ect ect   I agree. Unbelievable how many people choose A-PVP/MDPV/Salt/wtf ever over meth these days.   It's my personal opinion that anny dope just has a lot of residual pseudoephedrine in it, keeping you tweaked for a bit longer than ice. Even though it keeps you tweaked longer, it feels like a much dirtier tweak, compared to ice. Make sense? Sure.    Some nerve.   You gotta swish, all the shit just sticks to your mouth otherwise. That brother is one crazy asshole.   Mailman?   Hair of the dog, son.   See, this is why you always start low. Start with a $100 goal, that way you'll still receive whatever money is donated, whether the campaign is a bust or not... there's no reason to set the goal at some outlandish number like half a million dollars, because if people want to donate, they'll donate regardless.    Canadians like the strains that will stop their nutsack from freezing to their legs.   I sent my old lady to the store for Immodium the other day, she came back with name brand cuz I'm a retard, and I saw it had another ingredient in it, so I didn't use it.. and yeah, they're fuckin huge.   Just go fucking get it bro. Jesus.   Sounds like he's just fuckin lazy to me.   Western Union online money transfer didn't work the first time I tried it, I just kept trying it til it went through... now it works every time. I suggest you just keep trying.   U-47700 has some dissociative properties, maybe the very small dose of A-PVP amplified them. Most people say the dissociative properties of U-47700 won't rear their ugly head unless it's a very high dose.   I can't imagine it was, that would basically mean it was attempted murder. It doesn't make any sense for the vendor to cut it otherwise, it obviously couldn't have been an attempt to make the product longer or stronger, that just doesn't make sense.   This is scary.   These guys accept bank wire from EU, and they also accept Western Union: http://www.bikhuk.com/  They used to be very popular around here but they don't seem too popular as of late, not sure why that is. Something about a decline in quality.  Basically just use Google to find somewhere that accepts Western Union and just do it that way.   I love you too, man.   dude. shit gives me the worst withdrawals i've ever had in my fucking life. usually i can handle withdrawal pretty well, but this shit just incapacitated me. i've actually done a pretty good job avoiding the needle when it comes to this stuff, smoking and snorting it seems to wreck me good enough i guess.   I discovered butyrfentanyl powder and I haven't looked back since. lol.   I had it after the raise in concentration. I don't know though, plenty of other people have said they liked it, so maybe it's just me. And no, IV didn't burn.   for different penises?   It was pretty disappointing, I would get the powder if I ever got it again, which I won't.   Yes, it was a solution, it wasn't as viscous as PG or VG, and it was mentholated. I didn't have much of a tolerance, just mostly from kratom. He changes the status of the order when he ships it. It says something like "J pack department - Shipped"   I shot it, damn near the whole bottle just to get high, and then I got nasty dissociative effects. Do not recommend.   5 bucks? A bullet is still cheaper, albeit not as fun.   I'm in relative proximity to you, and I received mine in 6 days. I was pretty surprised.   They're on the bad list.   I feel so bad for these mother fuckers in the UK.    The people at the store must think you have a serious problem with your shitter. Toss and wash is best way to take it. Best strain is subjective, you see.   That's pretty gangster.   Jesus Christ. How many lopes you eating a day?   You know me better than I know myself, son   LEST WE NOT   Dude. Those brown chunks of sugar in the sugar bowl... The ones you get if you scoop sugar without rinsing the spoon, like a lazy nigger ... Now them fuckers look potent.    I think that mostly depends on the method you used to pay for them. Idk for sure though, somebody please correct me if need be.   An hero? Seems to me you'd like him to hang it up.   I'll send you it, but first, I need to see a picture of you jamming a screwdriver right up your dickhole. No tickling the tip, either, you gotta get handle-deep on that mother fucker.  	72
 What I mean is a prequel focusing on Shrek's life before Shrek 1 and a prequel on Donkey's life before Shrek 1 etc. If Puss in Boots was successful, then these could do just as well in my opinion. I especially would pay to see a Donkey movie!       u are not wrong         anyone hear the Spider-Man reference?   this is perfect casting!!    I had no "hopes" for this film. I just saw it was critically praised and me and my friend watched it for something fun to do (+ i wanted to see what all the fuss was about). And imo it was disappointing.   and sorry "they're supposed to be dumb" thats just idiotic to me.    wow. typical redditor. this isn't a plea for attention at all, i just didn't like the film. sick of assholes like yourself assuming that just cus im against popular opinion that im automatically wrong. no. i didnt like it. end of story. no plea.    glad im not alone   completely agree about the soundtrack!   1. I thought the soundtrack was cool but very misused. WHY they played it during the silent driving scenes where there's no tension or fear building up i will never know. 2. The main girl was such a dumb character. On the beach, she should have been constantly looking around for "it" rather than just look out to sea, then she gets hit by it. So dumb! 3. There was no tension. 4. It wasnt scary.  5. The ending was dogshit.   anyway, thats just my opinion. (let the hate begin)   agreed         fake      as insignificant as it is, i loved that they kept in the guy saying "fuck you asshole!" i thought they were going to remove it cus of the pg-13 rating but no. when he said it it made me smile :)   Im in the UK also  Tomorrowland was called "Tomorrowland: A World Beyond" The Adventures of Tintin was given the subtitle "The Secret of the Unicorn" Neighbors was called "Bad Neighbours"  thats all i can think of but i know theres more  	19
    Adam, just exactly how Savage are you?   Wasn't half bad.    I ran a 2 mile in 15 minutes and 42 seconds. I kept counting in my head the number of laps left and this was the first time I ever competed in the 2 mile. I did pretty good. 6th place out of 13. http://imgur.com/zVT4eya  	4
 The picture was ok but somewhere between my photos folder and uploading to imgur it just disappeared. I waited awhile for my phone to stop being a brat and reposted. Damn you technology! So mysterious, so powerful..   It does seem particularly specific..   That's rough. My SO is similar in the sense that he tends to keep things totally inside his own head before he is absolutely certain of.. Whatever he needs to be certain about, like a solution or getting over the emotions or whatever it is. I've had to learn not to hound him even when I know something is wrong, and wait for him to talk when he is ready. Sometimes he doesn't talk and just feels better on his own and I have learned to accept that and just be a quiet support system.  If she doesn't want to talk about things, maybe she just needs a rock, a constant; the next best option is allowing yourself to that for her, even a distraction from her problems. Let her feel normal and not be focused on her problems. She knows you are there if she needs anything, she knows you love her and are there to talk and in the meantime just let her get it sorted in her head.   Is there maybe some indirect way you can comfort her, maybe massages or a bath together or even something non-romantic like cook her a meal or bike riding or something you both enjoy? Maybe she would respond more openly if you could take the pressure off and just let her come to you if she decides she needs a shoulder to cry on.   Also, just from my own personal experience; the worst thing you can do when someone if upset and doesn't want to talk about it is keep asking them to talk about it and not let them get over it on their own if that's what they want to do because it just makes everyone feel worse. And definitely don't put yourself down or get mad at yourself on her behalf, it's counterproductive and it will just make everyone more sad.  But my main advice is just try to be her rock this time; maybe she's not used to having that and just needs time to open up to it.  Edit: some words   Only cuz it made me go "whoaa" so I knew we were in the same boat   Dude pass the j   Awesome good call :D thanks!   Plus it will hang/move strangely because it's so heavy. I could see it working better with thick dreads maybe..   No clue what you're talking about. Have an upvote!   The smaller the vagina, the more effective the move.       I'm going as fast as I can! (It might be like an hour tho still ... )   The picture didn't work; I can't figure out how to delete a post on mobile. I will fix this guys, I swear!      Amazing!   Aw bummer I was counting on that working since I already have puberty stretch marks on my legs. Oh well I still gotta try! Fingers crossed for good genes..   It's the perfect plan!  	16
 I like Harry Crews, William Gay, Larry Brown, Donald Ray Pollock, Flannery O'Connor, Faulkner, McCarthy, McCullers, and a few more.       Please stop using "the feels", it makes you sound like an idiot   I read SK's The Stand straight after and I think it's so much better  This is making my eye twitch     Strongly disagree.   Brooks is saying that Coates negative view of American history is wrong (point #2, ""I think you distort American history"), and that even if he is actually right, stop to stop his complaining (point #4). Then he has the gall (point #6) to claim that Coates' writing is actually hurting the country/American dream.  Brooks isn't wrong per say, just missing the point, and straw-manning. Brooks did not need to point out the obvious fact that "White America's not all bad!" It's hardly a review - it's just smug condescension from his ivory tower.     Hated Jim Gaffigan's book *Dad is Fat*   he's a tone deaf asshole who is handwaving away racial complaints from his yacht   because he's playing the upper middle class white man victim card in response to meaningful racial criticism   I really hate this article, but it's controversial and in the news, so posted for discussion      lolita   interesting take on american psycho [here:](https://italkyoubored.wordpress.com/2011/10/20/american-psycho-maybe-not-the-book-you-think-it-is/)  A two decade old novel might seem appropriate now, of haves in glass towers and have nots protesting in the streets, a book which is supposedly either a literal story of an investment banker who is a serial killer, or an investment banker who only imagines that he kills a series of men and women, his murder spree a metaphor for his professions indifference to larger society and the damage he does to it. Curious about whether this book would shed light on the turmoil now, I found a third theme  the book is a cryptomorph, its subject neither mass murder, or a metaphor for the financial world, but about being gay and closeted during the first years of the AIDS outbreak. This is not a case of a symbolic undercurrent; almost all the male characters, including Patrick Bateman and Timothy Price are gay closeted men, with that aspect of their lives, off-stage and unspoken directly of, but most certainly there. (cont.)         Are you a child to not understand people's differing reactions to sexual vs non sexual violence?    Harry Crews is a master and virtually unknown. *Feast of Snakes* is a good place to start but everything I've read by him has been unreal.  If you like southern gothic - Larry Brown, William Gay, Flannery Oconnor, Faulkner, etc, you should give Crews a try, although he is very different from all in his own way.  Nice article on him from the millions: http://www.themillions.com/2012/04/harry-crews-and-the-death-of-southern-literature.html   Keep telling yourself that   You mean WotC and Hasbro's reaction to banning a guy that anally and vaginally raped a girl passed out over a toilet?      Give yourself a congratulatory pat on the back for your assumedly correct position on the book you've never read!    The article doesn't even mention the word rape besides in the tweet. Nice reporting!   I'm not arguing that, I think it's just a fact that this is a win-win situation for Cruz.  What I'm saying is that the NYT can't simply claim it has sources that show manipulation through bulk sales in the face of multiple other sources/newspapers contradicting that statement, and expect to come out of the situation unharmed (whether it be public opinion, integrity, litigation, etc)   I'm pretty sure the word is not solely reserved for legal matters...  If you're going to exclude a politically charged book on the basis of bulk sales without providing evidence, it's going to cause a media frenzy. Your publication gets some unfavorable opinions printed about it, Cruz gets to drive home the point that the liberal media has an unfair bias against him, and sales are driven for the book you took off your list for cheating in the first place.        The onus is on the NYT to provide evidence of bulk sales used for manipulation, though. I don't doubt it happened, but you can't remove a book based on guesswork   Dirty Wars by Jeremy Scahill    nearly 400 pages of the author ejaculating nerd references onto the pages  Pretty much. This book is not for you.            Never thought I'd side with Ted Cruz on anything. Am I in bizarro world   I'll agree with that. I read *Off Season* and while not bad, didn't come away too impressed. He fits the description of the thread though.    :) I think those books are all good to great (haven't read Haunted), just gets old seeing them every time the topic is brought up   I knew I would love *The Sellout* by Paul Beatty after reading the very first page.   These threads always have the same books - *House of Leaves*, *Haunted*, *American Psycho*, *Wasp Factory*...  For something fresh I'll recommend ***Angel Dust Apocalypse* by Jeremy Robert Johnson**        Both are great. The movie leaves out the final chapter of the book, but otherwise I remember it following the book pretty faithfully. There are differing views about the inclusion of said last chapter, but I think the inclusion of it makes the story more complete.   **The Sellout by Paul Beatty**  So far, incredibly good      I'm not being nasty. Marginalizing other people's legitimate problems is very rude. As I said, there are plenty of places to discuss literature without gender/race politics being the centerpiece. I'd suggest posting in the 95% of other articles posted to the sub, rather than this particular article, if you'd really like to avoid it.   Her eyes widened, and she swiveled her head around to stare at me.  Sixth place? she repeated. In the world? No bullshit?  I crossed my heart, but did not hope to die.  That's some serious bill-paying skillage, she said. Color me impressed, Zack-Zack Lightman.  Color me flattered, Miss Larkin, I replied.  And there goes any chance of me reading this book. \*Tips fedora*   Seriously? No one is making you read the article. There's the entire remainder of the front page you can gladly peruse rather than this one. But why easily skip over something than butt in and proudly proclaim, "This issue does not affect me and should thusly be unimportant to all!"      I'm looking for help in upgrading this machine I ordered pre-built a year ago. I've built a machine before, but ordered this prebuilt because I had very little time to do the research/work. I mostly play indie and 4x games that aren't too graphically intensive, but I'm looking to upgrade for Fallout 4 (and Witcher 3 probably while I'm at it).  Looking to drop maybe a few hundred on what's likely a new graphics card, unless you build gurus feel otherwise. Can probably wait until November to do this if there's something to wait for. Apologies if this is the wrong place. I appreciate the help.

I don't have much sympathy for rapists so it isn't one I particularly care about either   still a rapist...   Good riddance   Generally anything published by nyrb classics   he's a rapist   Hey dude if you love rapists and chilling with them that's your prerogative   this is real life where actions have consequences that often reach beyond arbitrary laws. Some actions have lifelong effects like it or not   banning someone from a cardgame is not vigilante justice   because that's the consequences of being a rapist   banning someone from a card game is not an offense   his apology is incredibly phony, 3 months is not enough time to serve let alone rehabilitate for rape. He is a rich white boy who got off the hook easy because of his rich mommy and daddy  and anyone that frequently uses "white knighting" is probably a pretty bad human to begin with, to get back to my original point   you are just arguing semantics now, goodbye   i'm personally ok with grouping all rapists i've never met into the bucket of "bad person"   but the rapist's heartfelt apology was totally legit?   as opposed to your presumable stance, the line not being drawn there?   if you rape someone you're a sociopath and a you'd be a clown to believe anything he says   well he posted a heartfelt apology here so he must be a great guy   because being drunk and 19 is not a rape excuse. who cares about the tweet   how long did it take to come up with that clever reply   you're an awful human being   This sub hates Drew Levin more than the guy who actually fucking raped somebody   last i checked he didn't rape anyone so no    Whatever his criminal history may or may not be, banning a player for it sets a pretty insane precedent. Do they start doing background checks on DCI registration? Facebook creeping players now? Disallow players with a DUI so they aren't tempted to drive to FNM?  How about we just start with drawing the line at violent sexual assault   This sub is fucking insane   raping someone is definitely comparable to disallowing someone to play a card game. thumbs up   Couldn't have happened to a nicer rapist            Also, the inspiration and hope that it lends to people is very real.  So is the strife, hatred and death it's usage has caused     The readers' list has 4 Ayn Rand and 3 L. Ron Hubbard in the top *ten*. Yikes...   **The Invention of Morel, by Adolfo Bioy Casares**   Gene Wolfe uses this technique a lot, Severian from *The Book of the New Sun* is the one I always think of      Marion Zimmer Bradley molested her own daughter from the ages of 3 - 12         *The Demolished Man* is great as well   The book is alright I guess. Chuckled here and there, didn't feel too strongly either way about it. You're correct in that it's pretty much a poor man's Vonnegut. It has the absurdist humor, but is kind of lacking the trademark Vonnegut worldview/philosophy.  Haven't seen the movie.       *Bird Box* by Josh Malerman is a great suspenseful horror novel, not really too gory.    You could try reading horror that doesn't have supernatural elements, like *The Girl Next Door* or *We Have Always Lived In The Castle*   The sub is dead and has zero discussion.   I've only read three books published in 2015 this year, and I've only liked one of them, *Haints Stay* by Colin Winnette. I really enjoyed it, but I don't think it will be my favorite of the year come January. That said, if you are looking for a nice western with spare prose that mixes violence and beauty you will enjoy it.   It's a booklist, so I linked it here - http://flavorwire.com/524728/the-15-best-fiction-books-of-2015-so-far/view-all  Do you agree with the list? What have you read that was published this year that has been your favorite?     Richard Yates is famous for Revolutionary Road due to the movie but almost no one has read The Easter Parade, which is his best novel      It's a deceptively simple sentence that does an incredible amount. It establishes a grim setting and tone, and invokes curiosity in the reader (what event has happened that caused them to sleep in a gym?). I'm no English major, but I think it's a great opener.   I am reading *Haints Stay* right now. So good!   I can't believe "________________" isn't on the list      I'm very serious   Yes, ebooks exist, but you could alternatively just ask them while you're on a date if they like to read. If they said no, it would be a huge deal breaker for me.   And? Are you going to choose the first woman you see on the street to be your wife because you don't want to judge?   I read things out of my comfort zone all of the time, but they don't look boring to me.   The only time I'll read books that look boring to me is if they're my book club's selection. Sometimes I'm pleasantly surprised, and sometimes they're boring   It isn't a criteria for liking/disliking someone, it's his/her criteria for picking a partner - two very different things.       There's a stigma against reading in this sub too. Put a nickel in a jar every time you see the word "pretentious" here,  and treat yourself to a nice dinner at the end of every week      Lol, 500 upvotes for a guy acting like a huge asshole. Great sub               Yeah he got a big head and tried to take on an impossible challenge while being pretty green to directing. Still don't see why that makes him hatable rather than more admirable. I'll gladly take a failed movie from a director with heart that tries to be experimental than the latest regurgitated formulaic hollywood anyday   I don't get the Franco hate on this sub, as the guy is a huge bookworm   *The Secret History* by Donna Tartt    Lots of good ones listed. Off the top of my head add ts elliot and ee cummings    some are okay with that. I'm not.  I'm not going to read Fifty Shades either, but why do you care?   Since it is frequently mentioned in blurbs about your books and the show, to what extent was Twin Peaks/David Lynch an influence on your writing?   not being serious ;)   Actually, it's about ethics in the portrayl of the BDSM community               Of course. I read too much to be able to afford to buy every book I want to read, and often don't really want to buy books I decide to just read on a whim   Here's my humble advice as a dad of a four and two year old:  Don't worry so much about *which* books to get. You will probably end up with a book overload from friends and family from gifts and hand me downs. My kids like books like *Where the Wild Things Are*, Mercer Meyer's *Little Critter* series, Dr. Seuss books, etc, but the books themselves aren't that important. (Edit: u/wjbc's list is great... very similar to what we read in our home)  Focus on making the books fun for your kids. Picture books are much better than reading them things for older kids like Harry Potter, as they can point things out, and you can ask them to find certain things ("Where's the frog on this page"). Interactivity is also pretty key - taking an imaginary apple from the page and eating it, doing wacky voices, dances to certain parts, stupid things like that.  Also, you'll be reading some of these books hundreds to thousands of times, so pick something you can have fun with as well.  Finally, most important piece of advice! Start reading the day your new baby comes home and do it every day! So important, develops vocabularly, letter and color recognition, and hopefully a lifelong love of learning. Good luck!      Neil Gaiman at the top of r/books? What's next, people praising Stephen King or *The Martian*?   Well, there's the Houston Foster-Watts   both incredible books. Never see anyone mention The Easter Parade, one of my all time favorites...      No, it's literally what you said   People say it's a vocal minority that ruins it for the rest but I never hear anything from rational feminists. They seem to be very quiet.  Translation: Every feminist is irrational. That's why you're getting jumped on   I don't think the point of the article was anger over spoiling new elements of the show. Rather, anger over the show just throwing setup and context out the window, and introducing new nonsensical, pointless, or badly written storylines that are counter to what made ASOIAF interesting and different in the first place.  One example: [Brienne just happening to show up in the woods at exactly the right time to deal the finishing blow to Stannis](#s)   Nothing. It's simply not that good            Not 100 percent set on the high seas, but McGlue by Ottessa Moshfegh is a great short book, highly recommended  	141
 I'm gonna cheat and say 3.  [Will Smith](http://i.cdn.turner.com/dr/hln/www/release/sites/default/files/2014/08/19/600full-the-fresh-prince-of-bel-air-screenshot.jpg)  [Alfonso Ribeiro](http://i.cdn.turner.com/v5cache/TBS/Images/Dynamic/i38/freshprince5_337x233_081720071243.jpg)  [James Avery](http://s3.amazonaws.com/rapgenius/Uncle_Phil.jpg)  Exhibit A: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLkBycpU-8s  Exhibit B: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w88-K_LusYU  Exhibit C: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AgkqTFasfmA  Most perfect casting ever IMO.   Looks like a promo shot for the new Mad Max.    finder keepers and all that  Theft is another word for it.   Is she actually not wearing trousers for some random reason or is it an illusion?   Probably a Lady Gaga video.   Browsing r/new.   James Bond is hunting, hunted and alone.  So it's a James Bond film then.   Be humble.   No it isn't. It's just a "what if" story.   Didn't Pixar just release a film? Are they rushing these things out now?   Looks more like heart shaped black fur rather than the nose being heart shaped.   All of them. All the double standards.   I have no idea how to feel about this film, I have mixed feelings about the last few.  Casino Royale = Awesome Quantum of Solcae = Pure shit Skyfall = Fogettable Spectre = ?  Also, James going off the grid, is he making a habit out of this or is it just me?   Did you not blend it?   How is that a whale? Also this is a very frequent repost.   No you can't get a calorie count, however, I can get one for you.         A rapper doesn't actually live the life he portrays in his videos and media? Wow.  This news brought to you by the university of no shit sherlock.   It might take a while. But we'll have all the karmas eventually.   Is your sister 12 or a homophobe?   And back to you! (We may be onto something here)   Thanks. Have one back :)   But that's a cool trick. Never heard of it until now.    I did it the legit way, as I've done with everything in that game.    Ho Lee Fuk.  Would love to show them an iPhone.   Do you mean the whale from the film or the whale used to portray the whale in the film?      I like they way Sepp was avoiding the money like he was scared of it.  "Oh noes. This money is not dirty. I can't let it touch me!"   I know. I was explaining to him why you get the RPG before the homing launcher in an attempt to quell his confusion.  Downvoted for clarifying my position. Ok then.   I like to fly low to the ground and close to buildings, you can't beat the situational awareness of 3rd person IMO. If you're in VTOL mode trying to nail enemies first person doesn't cut it unless they're far away. When in air to air combat I can always get a better view of my opponent looking around with the right stick in 3rd person than I do in 1st person. By definition the 1st person view limits your range of vision compared to 3rd.  At least that's how I see it.   I rarely did the free roam myself, it felt empty because there was nothing to do other than kill people. My online experience with 4 was mostly just races. I'm glad GTA Online was a huge improvement and I look forward to what they do with GTAVI :)   Struggling to think of a more pointless mod than this.  I got nothing.   That still would have been a wrong title since I'm pretty sure OP isn't the youtuber RedKeyMon.   You say that, but TBOGT added the best helicopter in the damn game, Yusuf's golden Buzzard!   You peasant, be gone from me!   There's literally dozens of videos on youtube showing you where to land every single stunt jump successfully.   Not me. I got my RPG months before the homing launcher wsa added to the game.  The weapons added by updates aren't level locked, that's why you get it before the RPG.   It's the hyrda, brought back from GTA San Andreas.   Is staged. It's a stunt.   I couldn't disagree more. I prefer flying in 3rd person because you can actually see what's below you, in a plane you can't do that in first person.  Edit: Changed can to can't, as was initially intended.   OP should get his facts right. This is [Red Keymon](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCm1F9GekuQVNf93XU7-i9kw), he does crazy stunts in GTA, and this was of course staged.  Source video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08F8hYlfDbc   Again? Oh no, wait. It's the same picture as before.    I doubt it will either. I doubt any will to be honest since I don't think they've done anything similar in the past. I'm still ok playing vanilla skyrim anyway, it's my favourite game.    He's not done yet I believe. Still, he won't look all that much like Red Skull. Maybe enough to resemble him.    Yeah they could. But I was just 18, they probably figured it wasn't worth it.    [I keep hearing the FUCKING NUMBERS!](http://i.imgur.com/vncZ8J3.gif)   I thought she meant illegal aliens until she mentioned the anal probing. That cleared things right up.   Either she's trolling or she's mentally disturbed. I hope she's seeing a psychiatrist either way.   For the uninitiated:  [Henry Damon](http://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/feb/06/henry-damon-marvel-villain-red-skull-captain-america)   The market for large swine ejaculate is LUCRATIVE.  I... I would imagine...   Back in 2003 I was working at McDonalds. When my friend came in I always gave him a little more than he asked for with his order. It escalated to the point where he would ask for a big mac meal and walk out with about 4 burgers, a load of nuggets, couple of drinks, and an apple pie or two.  Needless to say I was stupid but my manager wasn't.   I'm curious. At what point did you not see everyone losing their minds when he insinuated that immigrants are rapists and such? It was all over the web, and now here I an on a Monday morning hearing about him badmouthing a senator for the first time.   Wow. This really helps the bad image atheists have in America. I mean, this couldn't possibly make people think less of atheists, right?  How is this not just straight-up Christian propaganda?  I couldn't give a shit if someone wanted to pray before eating their meal in a restaurant.   [Yup](http://media.giphy.com/media/TWhOmZ783UrwA/giphy.gif)   If I didn't know I was in Italy until I found some Coke I'd be worried.   Anyone who doesn't say "YOLO", "SWAG", or "dank".  I would accept swag or dank if used with the correct meaning, not the new meanings kids have given them.   Breathe, usually.   "No, it's easy. Look! I made a [pidgeonrat](http://33.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_l2zm1z7mzN1qc073co1_400.gif)!"   This is the best synchronised gif I've seen since [this](http://img-9gag-fun.9cache.com/photo/a8jpQDQ_460sv.mp4)   The title kind of diminishes the role of all mothers around the world who didn't give birth in a car.  "Thats the reminder that the birth is very natural thing"  And many women who give birth "in the wild" like this tend to suffer more complications than those in hospital. There's a reason people try to get to a hospital when they're giving birth.    I know, and the point I'm making is that I hated everything about Morrowind. I could only muster 5 hours before giving up because of the terrible mechanics, Oblivion was my first you see.  But I see their point too. Now I know Morroblivion is supposedly finished I'm totally going to give that a go because so many people claim Morrowind is the best one, and this is the only way I'd be able to tolerate playing it again.   I'm 30 with no kids.  Let's do this?   Until they remastered Skyrim or Oblivion.   I tried to play Morrowind after staring my ES adventures with Oblivion, but 5 hours in I hated literally everything about it. I'd love to play it through the eyes of Oblivion. It would give me a chance to enjoy the land and story without the mechanics I hated so much.   And so CDs die and everyone moves exclusively to digital downloads for their music.    That is the most context specific gif I've ever seen. It's.. it's glorious!      There's a big difference between doing something normal like driving a car or flying a plane which in many cases are necessary, and deliberately doing something very dangerous by choice when there's no need to.    Good point. I always forget about old Hyabusa.    He's been in every major release in the main series.   I'm pretty sure he wasn't in Mortal Kombat Special Forces.    I like the way you felt like you had to clarify who Ryu was but not Slenderman or Spawn.    Another day, another person asking who we want to see as DLC.   Seriously, can we rename this subreddit  r/Whodoyouwantinfuturemortalkombatdlc already?   Man swimming in shark infested waters gets attacked by a shark.  Nothing unbelievable about it.    I've got no sympathy for people who swim in shark infested waters then get attacked by a shark. I feel the same way about those people as I do people who climb electrical towers and then get shocked.    The Grotti Turismo R, came as part of the business update back in the day. $500,000, one of the best cars IMO.    We built this city is an awesome tune! I'd stay if you played that.    I don't get it.    Ah I get it now. People played UMK3 in the arcades. Living in England (but not in a major city) the only time I ever got play an arcade machine as a kid was when the fair was in town. And even then, we were lucky to get MK1, and at 1 a go (which usually lasted no more than a couple of minutes) we didn't get to play on it all that much.  And so I keep forgetting about later MK games being released in the arcades.    No seriously, what colour is Pluto?    Ken Han is a deluded moron who spreads socially dangerous ideas and messages.    MK Trilogy was to UMK3 what UMK3 was to MK3. A better version with more characters.    I had it when I was around 13 I think on the PS1. Loved it. Had no one to play it with mind. But I'm pretty sure it had all the characters in the franchise up to that point. Including a playable Noob Saibot (my introduction to him), Rain's first appearance, and even various kostumes for some characters.  With Kano you could play as the MK1 or MK3 versions. Kung Lao MK2 or 3, Raiden (or Rayden back then) as MK1 or MK2 and some others too. The old versions were updated with kombos and shit.  MK Trilogy was to UMK3 what UMK3 was to MK3, simply a better version with more characters. This is why I'm always confused when people express love for UMK3 like it's the best version of the klassic MK games.    Nope. I just always loved the concept of freezing your opponent in place, loved it in the first game and never really branched out since.    I've heard of it. Being English I've never seen it and know nothin of it.   And don't call me Shirley.    Why do people keep hailing UMK3 as the superior classic MK when MK Trilogy was a thing? It introduces brutalities (unless I'm mistaken) and you could play as fucking GORO, KINTARO, MOTARO, AND SHAO KHAN!     When I was a kid me and my friends were convinced Cyrax was Scorpion because of him being yellow and the net was too similar to the spear.  We didn't a have access to lore and shit back then.    I liked Mk3, got it for my 11th (I think) birthday. By your logic UMK3 sucked, that's why the MK Trilogy exists.    It's not uncommon MK knowledge.    Sub-Zero has been my boy since Mortal Kombat 1. Always my go to guy. The day I realised he was the only character to be in all of them was almost as awesome as the time I found out Noob Saibot (easily my second fave) was the original Sub-Zero.  He's just the man.    Heard the name before, no idea who this woman is.    Genius. I love it.   Trouble's a brewing.   That was all fun and games, until I saw Ryan Dunn :'( I forgot how much I used to watch these guys in my teenage years and how seeing them again is almost like being with old friends once more.  I'm gonna call my Mum and tell her I love her.   MORE Liu Kang, Sub Zero, and King Lao costumes? They've got enough IMO. NRS should give some kostumes to the new characters and the dlc folks. Pay for a dlc character and get one kostume? Wtf?  Also klassic Raiden is already in the game. It's his MK1 outfit, can't get more klassic than that.    They did the MK1 classics in the last game. This game brought back the UMK3/MK Trilogy classics and I love it. I always choose sub zeros player 2 klassic skin because that's the colour he was in UMK3. The player 1 klassic skin has his darker MK4 colour for some reason.    Mk3 classics? Wat?   Great video. Glad you made it.    We just have to find a colour blind mushroom eater.    Nope. Just a case of "Isn't everyone sick of being asked this question yet? It's been answered at least 5 times at this point."   It's always my go to example of how something totally shit and mundane can be considered art and sell for loads of money. I thought art was supposed to take skill and talent. Anyone can roll out of bed and say "Welp, think I'll sell this bed and buy a new house."      Let me guess. American, right?   I love the way the firefighter took a couple of seconds to size up the guy and the situation before taking the guy down.   Noes Geralt not go around butchering people and cutting their heads off and such?   Yeah, so? Isn't that what they had to do to get Jason and Predator?   Didn't know that. But still, it's possible they could acquire the rights isn't it?   True, Jason is slow. Good point.   You prefer the bed piece? It's an unmade bed! If that is art then literally anything can be. Can't believe someone paid 150,000 for something they could easily have made at home, or unmade.   So it's official. We now have a cool new art style to appreciate.  Better than that modern bullshit.  ["Oh wow, an unmade bed, pay me 150,000 for my art!"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_Bed)   I don't know. He's slow (have you seen him run?), he's not known for gore, in fact most of the people he kills don't show gore.  I'm not saying he isn't cool, I'm just saying I don't think he's a good fit for the MK universe.   And now dambladge is how I'm going to say that word lol.  I was disappointed to find out that Reptile's slide doesn't go under projectiles. Sub-Zero has always been my main you see, and I'm used to being able to close distance when the enemy uses projectiles.  Just googled Reptil buffs and found this comment:  "Lol, I just checked the notes. He got NERFED if anything. Nerf to his nimble combos due to 4 having lower damage, buff to his absolutely pointless strings that no one uses. The only buff that matters is overhead doing 2 more damage but that doesn't affect him a lot exactly. Wow."  Can you confirm?   The only one I truly want :(   Don't know why you've been downvoted. That's actually not a bad idea.    And Starkiller. He was fun to use.    He's in Soul Calibur IV and would feel reeeeeally out of place in the MK universe. Predator, Jason, and Freddie felt ok because those films are known for their graphic violence and numerous fatalities. At least that's how I see it.    Nope. He wants characters that he enjoyed I. MK9 to be in this new game with its fancy new mechanics and features.    Sektoke.  Smytor.  You see where I'm going with this.   Another day, another person asking this question. Don't we all know which characters are wanted by this point?   I really wanted to enjoy using Reptile once they added the klassic skin, but he just feels underpowered compared to most others. Conglaturation on getting this trophy with Reptile!   It blows my mind how many people online can whoop my ass and yet I got that trophy on April the 22nd, three days after I got the game.   I can't quite believe I just spent 45 minutes watching someone fail to drill a lock off a door.    I came here because I almost saw my name in the title.   Is this the Kevin Smith/Andy McElfresh film? I thought about this just yesterday (after hearing th podcast many moons ago) and thought "I wonder if that film is still happening."   The way that kid backed off in fear. Looks like he's been on the wrong end of that guy before.   Take the ski mask off, that really sets them off.    The old speeding up to pass people on the street so you don't accidentally somehow make them think they're about to meet their doom.   I know it well.    That music was just the same 5 seconds looped over and over for 4 minutes.  And the lead guitarist didn't look at the crowd. Not fucking once. He just kept shifting from one back-facing-the-crowd position to another.    I just finished watching that video. Great job here mate.    I just finished watching Man of Steel again for the time since release.   This trailer makes me laugh at this film.    Who? Where? What?  Is this available now?   It's all relative. But you mentioned the 70's, not the 90's.   That's how I spend my money.    Rich people lead expensive lives. You get his with a cm few bad court cases and bam! No longer got the money for that expensive lifestyle.    That's what I thought. Thanks for clarifying.    You're no fun.   It says on tag in he gets "+100% basic damage".  Does this include the damage of his specials?   How dare you not take this seriously and actually try to make us laugh?  Get out!   So basically all the bad things on the internet should represent the internet and leave all the good stuff off?  Apart from boobs of course. Who doesn't love boobs?   My submission: http://www.randompicturesblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Welcome-to-the-internet...-here-it-is-in-one-photo-600x480.jpg   Better?   [You mean like this, only in flag form?](http://i.imgur.com/9IvVY7e.jpg)   I would also have accepted "many giant strips of bacon".   A genuinely great submission. I think this could actually be the flag of the internet, if such a thing was required. No jokes, just truth.   Lol. Maybe you should submit one with enough Dickbutt in it. I feel under qualified to determine how much Dickbutt is enough Dickbutt.      I greatly enjoyed Sandstorm and Never Gonna Give You Up before the internet ruined them.    but I remember a time **not so long ago** that public displays of homophobic violence were frequently seen in the US. **Leading up to** American psychology dropping homosexuality as a mental illness in **the 1970's**[1] there were frequent acts of violence     You don't "get" clickbait, you make it.   ITT: Way too many uses of the term "a women".   Finally. Someone put it into terms I can use to explain this to people.    Looks just like Supersonic Acrobatic Rocket Powered Battle Cars on PS3.  Always loved the name of that game.    Well done.    SUCK-AAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!!!!!!!!   Every single "person" there that's not on fire is a reprehensible cunt that should be shot dead IMO.    They'd probably just put in the story character like Sindel, Baraka, Kabal, and Rain as they seem to be the most requested of the story characters. I can't see them soon smoke since he's a faction kill.  I don't care about those though, Noob is life.    I feel so redundant knowing that a creature with a relatively simple mind, no arms, and no legs can climb a tree without the aid of branches.    This makes me happy.    At first I thought the flagpole was in the back of his truck.  I was wondering how his freedom was going to fit under bridges.   Edit: Added two words for grammar.    I like Bryan Cranston and all, but that was a bit of a dick response to a genuine question.    You didn't shorten it, you told a completely different story. This video doesn't explain the COD story, it explains the COD zombies story.    Yeah, iOS user here. Oh well.    Maybe when you're being entertained ed you consider it wanted time, but not me. Time spent having fun is time spent well in my opinion. But thanks for your insightful comment.    You can explain it quicker I'm sure. But this is obviously a very in depth look at it.    It's probably more in depth.    The game fails to load the cloud save for me after hanging on a black screen for ages. I then can choose to load the device save. But when I try a battle it hangs while looking for allies. Are their servers messed up or something? Anyone else having this issue?   I'm not blowing my precious koins on the chance to get that. I want it. But no doubt I'd be paying 70,000 to get cards I've already got, about 5 times. There's already so much I need to spend the koins on, like support cards, and trying to save up to promote Raiden and Liu Kang.    Just saw a video of a guy opening the pack and the cards DO NOT show up in the store after spending 850 souls you need to spends 850 souls every time you want to fuse them. Screw that. Looks like I'm not getting the new characters.    This post needs to be the top comment.    Ah nice always taken it as "No way am I reading all that text. Fuck it."   I doubt most people will watch it all in one sitting lol.    Or it was just that the zombies mode had very little story until BO2. It was mostly fan speculation that eventually became canon. Zombies was made in a rush as a direct response to horde mode in Gears 2, so they didn't have time to make a story. The game came first, then the story followed.    I reddit on my phone a bit too, but usually where there's wifi ;)   Are stating its TL;DW or are you asking what it means?  It's too long, didn't watch.   Not sure why people would come to comments section to tell me they didn't watch it because it's too long. I said its 4 hours in the title!   Yeah pretty much. I'm certain most of the story is fan fiction made canon anyway. I just wanted to refresh myself on what happened to the characters and such.    Good for you. You came here to say that anyway? Cool.    Damn. No way I'm paying 40 to buy the amount of souls needed. Sucks.    Good question.    Lol. Cheating scum.    I think so. I haven't done tower battle since April.    Can you get Revenant Sub-Zero and Revenant Jax from the gold Kombat pack or do you need to save for 3 years to buy the new pack for 850 souls?   My only advice is you must get all the challenges done, all of them. You'll fail if you don't. Make sure you know what the challenge is just before the fight loads. If you do all 5(?) in a row you get crazy points. I think I took part in about 7-10 towers before I won one.    I did. The ending was brilliant.    How can someone boast about a good team if they cheated to get them? I don't understand hack-boasters. It's like when people on GTA Online say "I'm level 12 and I've got a tank, a hydra, a buzzard, and 20 cars!"  I'm all like, "So? I'm level 352, I have all those too. The difference being I actually put the time in to earn them."   If you're not good enough to unlock the skin then you don't deserve it.  Nah I'm joking of course. But I'm not sharing my ID with anyone. Good luck in your search.   Or you could be interested in it. I plan to play GTA Online later. During the many and lengthy loading screens I'll be playing Mortal Kombat X Mobile and listening to this video. Maximising my gaming lol.    You could have the audio going on in the background if you're worried about the video taking too much of your time up.    So does she work at Jamba Juice or eBay?   Ok.   As will I. During loading screens on GTA Online lol.   Sweet! A new AVGN video I've not seen. How did I miss it?      What's HK 97?      Uh, no. what would be funny about watching Jayden Smith act. Fresh Prince is funny, this would be painful.   And people laugh at me and call me manes when I refuse to go on rides like these.  At least I'm still alive.   ...and one count of being an accessory to being a bear.   70k to (most likely) get 3 gear cards I've already got is pretty steep. Ooh I can improve an item so my recovery goes from 13% to 14%. I have more important things to blow my koins on, I can still get gear as season rewards.    Well that sucks. Oh well. Thanks.    Does anyone know if Revenant Jax will be Netherrealm, or Special Forces, or both?  	199

    I've actually rolled a car when I was 14.  Valentine's day, 1998 to be specific.  Icy roads, and my dad was too drunk to drive, so I did.  I rolled a 1972 Toyota Corona.  Ever had to roll down the window to roll it up, and shove a 330 lb man off of you because he didn't wear a seat belt?  I have.  I won't drive anything anywhere if people aren't belted in.    I don't care if I'm in ID.  No seatbelt = me no drive.  I'll turn off the car and put it in neutrual.  It's amazing how strong a 95 lb 14 year old kid is in a life threatening situation. (a 330 lb man who is my dad is laying on top of me, pick him up and throw him to the passenger side).  take off the seat belt, and fall down to the roof.  Then the mile long walk to the ranch house, "grandpa, I had a wreck, the cars upside down, and my dad is stuck inside".  That was a great year, 98.  Best year ever.  I wish I could re-live 02/14/98 every day.  NOT.    We were supposed to have lobster that day.  Didn't happen.  My dad got his ass kicked by my grandpa, and I had to drive the now fucked up car home.  Fun times.  NOT.  I drove to town later that night and picked up papa murphy's, because the lobster went bad.  I haven't went on that road since.   OK, then why did when I hit whatever the hell I it at 50 in the ditch feel like I just punched in the chest by Hulk Hogan, (yeah, I used to watch wrestling a lot).  and why did it trap me until I figuured out to relax my chest and then the seat belt went slack?  50-0 in a couple of milliseconds is fun.  NOT!   I didn't notice any give when I was a dumbass 19 year old kid driving down the road trying to read my mail.  One second, on the road, the next, 20 feet down, and desperatly trying to stop, (and couldn't because I was literally in the water and going 50), , and then hit something under water so hard that it sunk my stereo reciever in my dash by a foot, and almost got hit in the head by by sub, (unsecure load).  I almost shot out my rear window until I realized "hey what If I try and roll down my driver window?.  It worked, so I crawled out.  I had my .45LC lined up and was about ready to shoot until I remembered "try rolling down the window before shooting".  That saved me about $710 of glass damage.  I had my finger on the trigger and was about ready to squeeze off a round.  I thought I was trapped because my doors wouldn't open.  That sudden stop, (still don't know what I hit underwater when I was in that ditch even 12 years later, but that sudden stop hurt like hell).   I'm 32 years old and just figured it out when I yelled it at the TV.  Yes, I heard the phrase when I was 12, but didn't know what it meant, so I never said it.  I think I was watching a porno, because they did get a room.  O.o      sfc /scannow  (command prompt as admin)   Well answer this:  Have you got any updates pushed to you through WU?   Yes, if MS was a person, and they had a house, and I knew where they lived, and really intended on doing it.  In order for a crime to be committed, you have to have the 3M's met:  **Means:**  (nope, not a physical person with no physical address to firebomb)  **Method:**  (Duh, outlined above)  **Motivation:** (Nope)  Unless all 3 requirements have been established, no crime committed.   That's why the HANS restraining device is mandantory in NASCAR and NHRA racing.  Don't have it?  Simple solution.  You're not on the track.  Dale Earnhardt's death made it mandatory in NASCAR.  I remember that wreck on the final lap of the 2001 Daytona 500 very well.  I broke the news to my dad that "Earnhardt is dead!". :(  We never watched NASCAR again together again.  I tried back in 2007, but it just wasn't the same without "The Intimidator".  Haven't bothered watching it since.  I used to keep a race schedule 2 years in advance.  It used to be our "church".  Now, I have no idea when the next race is besides "sunday?"   Good point.  Didn't think of that!  I was just thinking "they are safer, and required to get on the track if you race in the 12's or faster, so why not everybody?"  No, I can't race in the 12's.  I was at the track last week, and I pulled in 17.913s, (yeah, I'm slow, (it's a 97 blazer for god sakes).   In WA, it says I either have to have a windshield, or wear goggles.  (understandable).  Legally, there's nothing stopping me from chopping off the entire top of my truck off, and driving it down the road with a pair of ski goggles on.  (no, I'm not doing that, I've already drove with a failed heating fan, and that was cold enough to freeze up the inside of the windshield so I had to put on my shades and hang out the window at 60 to see where the hell I was going).  Good point about the noise ordinances. :)  I completly forgot about that. :)  I rebuilt my father's 93 Geo Metro back in 2001, and decided "fuck the exhaust, and just ran a straight pipe.  He got a warning about 121 dB :D  I put on a muffler. :D I didn't bother with the cat since no emissions control around here.  (why I put on a glass pack on a Metro?  because I had an extra one, so why not?)  It met noise ordinances. :)   Except for my 77 impala, (where I did weld the doors shut), I actually have had to get into my rig several times NASCAR style because some asshole parked too close too me.  Wasn't exactly fun, but I can do it.   OK, assuming the DMV approved it, and gave me registration, what would a cop do if I got pulled over for I don't know, taking an improper right turn? but when stopped, and he looked in, I was strapped in like I'm on the track, and was wearing a full helmet, a 5pt restraining device, and had a HANS restraining device strapping my head in to I didn't snap my neck in case I did a Dale Earnhardt, and had to actually take off all of my saftey gear before I could even get access to the glove box to get my DL/Reg/Ins?  (No, I don't have like $250,000 to put into such an old truck, so this question is purely hypothetical).  For the sake of argument, noise ordinances don't exist, so I didn't get stopped for being as loud as a jet taking off.   Because I'd have to get in and out of the rig by climbing through my window?  (not exactly easy access, but I can do it).   And give is good why?  I kind of like not eating the steering wheel.  Oh, the air bags on my truck don't work, and my current one is the first one I've had that actually has air bags.  This is also the first rig that I've had that has ABS.   OK, I did a lot of stupid shit to my rig when I was 16, (my door wouldn't lock shut one time, so I slammed it shut, and welded it closed).  I had to get out of my car NASCAR style for 2 years until I got into a head-on and kind of had to get rid of that rig because I ruined it).  But as a grown ass man, I know how to fix a door that won't latch shut, and I don't need a mig welder anymore.  :)  But good point.  Although the thought of duct tape never entered my mind to use for anything besides the air intake manifold, (and it worked).  Hmm, so what if I had endless money, and decided to convert my truck into a "race ready, street legal" truck, and got pulled over in a converted 1997 Blazer LT obviously purposly rebuilt for the track, but met legal requirements to be a legal road vehicle.  (hey, if people can ride horses on the street, why can't I legally drive my hypothetically converted truck down the road so long as I obey all laws?)  Let's say I met all NASCAR/NHRA requirements, but also had indicators, plates, lights, (and in some areas a muffler and cat)?  (and if I had endless money, there's no way in hell I would waste my time with my truck, I'd just build one).   OK, what if I got my truck track ready, but had all the legal indicators, brake lights, regular tires, plates, headlamps, but for all intents and purposes, it was a race rig?  (weld doors shut, replace all glass with plexiglass, have mesh netting, strip out all passenger seats, put in a racing seat, a 5 pt restraint harness, a HANS restraint device, and dropped in a 454 with dual quads, and straight piped my exhaust.  Basically make a street-legal, race ready 97 Blazer LT.   damn it.   I've rolled a car when I was 14, and my dad wasn't wearing a seatbelt.  I was.  A 330lb man landed on a 95 lb child.  He was too drunk to drive, so I did.  It was Valentine's Day, 1997.  It's amazing how strong a 14 year old kid is when he's upside down and trapped.  After that incident, I refuse to move a vehicle unless everybody is belted in.  I literally picked him up off of me, and thew him back to the passenger side.  Then the mile long walk back to the ranch house.  That was fun.  NOT.  It was confusing enough getting out of a standard seat belt in a 1972 Toyota Corona, (after I shoved my dad off of me).  I had to crawl UP to the underbody of the car and get out.  and roll my window down, (which is now up), to climb out.  My granddad kicked my dad's ass because he was too drunk to drive, and had to pull us out with a D6.  Yes, the car still drove when righted, (but very shittily).  I had to drive home because my dad was drunk, and just got his ass kicked.  Good point about the fire though.  Had it caught on fire, I would have likely decided "fuck this!" and just ran.  Getting out of a 5pt restraint harness would have been almost impossible.  That's a good reason.   Who the hell would duct tape it to I don't know what?  It has to be installed to the frame of the vehicle, and with lag bolts, and with lock washers and a 150lb/in torque wrench.  Ideally, spot welded so you can be **absolutely sure** it isn't going anywhere EVER.  So why don't NHRA and NHTSA have the same requirements for vehicles, (besides the fact nobody goes 150 on the highway)?   Yes, you will. :)   Ah! :)   Yeah, but why?  I could get behind the wheel of the 51 ford (with no belts at all), and go 60MPH down the highway, (legal speed limit), if I wanted to, but I won't because I don't want to be road pizza.  I think a **minimum** of a 3 pt restraining harness should be mandatory, but if you want to strip your rig and make it a race vehicle, you should be allowed to, (so long as your street legal).  Why would they care if I gutted my truck, put in a roll bar, plexiglass shielding, welded my doors shut, put in a roll bar with cross members, put in a racing seat, and a 5 pt restraining harness with a HANS restraint device, and wore a helmet, and drove down the road?  (I mean besides the fact I'm taking a truck designed for the track out on the street).    **EDIT:** Are they really that worried that I won't be able to reach my radio to change the station? (which you shouldn't be doing while driving anyhow).   OK, so why not for the driver's seat at least?  Assumedly, an adult is going to be driving, and not an 8 yo kid, (unless you're rural, but that's a different story).  Also, what if I were to strip out my truck, and install a racing seat and a 5 pt restraining harness, and wear a helmet, and install a HANS restraining device, and out roll bars in my truck?  (other than I would obviously be taking a rig meant for the track out on the street).           The Insider program is now closed, as are the activation servers until the 29^th.  But yes, 10240 is RTM, and you'll have no problems updating to the "final" release. :)   I'll burn down their house, and set bombs to detonate in the drive and lawn, and then shoot anybody who leaves the property.  :grr:  (not really, I'm already running 10240, so no rush).   Open regedit, and go to:       HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\BuildLabEx\  Source:  Been fucking around with the registry since Windows 3.11FW, and I know how to navigate it.  :)  **EDIT:**  Fun Fact:  Windows 10 is really Windows NT version 6.3, (look under ..\CurrentVersion)   They've had that page up for 3 years now.  It's just flat out wrong.  When I called the cable company earlier this year, I had a question about why in the 90's that I was able to pick up cable TV with my antenna if I pointed it SSE, and had a complete channel line up, and would it work now?"  (yes, it really did happen, I was able to pick up a cable system over 30 miles away if the conditions were right).  They said likely a signal leak from a neighbor, but "it won't work now because every device connected to the network must be authorized."  I know that statement is false, because my analog TV just works like it always has, and my HDTV works perfectly fine to pick up both analog and ClearQAM service.  I never registered my serials with them, and just plugged them into the wall.  Cable here works just as it always has.  I still haven't gotten a satisfactory answer to how come I was able to pick up a city over 30 miles away cable TV system on my antenna back in the 90's.   We already have that.  It's called a Union.  Join one if you want.  Nobody is stopping you.   No you don't.  You could say "Fuck you, I quit!", and walk off the job mid shift, and they can't do anything legally about it.  You won't get a good reference, but there is no legal obligation for you to give them any notice at all.   Already have it with the Google Wallet "tap to pay".  I don't use it.  I even have an SGSIII i9300 that supports NFC.  It's faster to just use my card.   It will update your build to:       10240.16393.amd64fre.th1_st1.150717-1719                     Wrong about at will employment. While you can be terminated for any/no reason, you can also quit for any/no reason. If it is not "at will", it is by definition, compulsory. Somebody is being forced to do something against their choice under penalty of law. We had that once. It's called 1776-1865.   The FHA already says you can't get evicted or refused rental because of sexual orientation.   My bank just issued me a card that does exactly this. Large retail stores like Walmart are already set up to do it, and have been for several years. I still use the mag swipe though, as it is faster.   You could call it your "liquid lunch", or "supper in a sack".   You realize that tools exist for this, and it's [pretty cheap](http://www.techtoolsupply.com/ProductDetails.asp?ProductCode=RMT-LTT7)?  http://www.techtoolsupply.com/v/vspfiles/photos/RMT-LTT7-2T.jpg   Or you know, just plug it into the wall, and do a channel scan. :)  4 years ago, I got all of the music channels too, but they cut those off, (actually I had hundreds of free digital channels).  Now I get all 68 analog channels, and 25 digital.  Analog isn't going anywhere.  The only reason I have a [STB3500II](http://www.amazon.com/3500STBII-Multi-Function-Converter-Recording-Playback/dp/B00GOILYB6/ref=dp_ob_title_ce) on my upstairs TV is because it's an "old" NTSC TV from 2002, so I need the $35 box (that I own), to get the digital channels.  On my living room TV, I just have it plugged in to the wall.   Yeah, "$10 for basic broadcast"  The equipment and taxes cost more than the "special offer" for TV.   TWC charges $2.75/mo for a DTC.  (completely unneeded here, even though the website says I do).  http://www.timewarnercable.com/en/support/tv/topics/digital-adapters.html   Here's the Win32 port:  http://www.fdisk.com/doslynx/lynxport.htm      Sure there is.  Use [Lynx browser](http://lynx.isc.org/lynx2.8.7/index.html).   I still have full analog and ClearQAM service here.  TWC on the phone says "you need a cable box".  Um, no you don't.  They say even for basic service, you need a DTC for $4/mo.  No, you don't.  Just plug your TV into the wall, and away you go.  **EDIT:**  To get access to the cable hookup, you'll need one of [these](http://www.techtoolsupply.com/ProductDetails.asp?ProductCode=lk03009276):  http://www.techtoolsupply.com/v/vspfiles/photos/LK03009276-2T.jpg  And if the terminal is capped off, you'll need one of [these](http://www.techtoolsupply.com/ProductDetails.asp?ProductCode=RMT-LTT7):  http://www.techtoolsupply.com/v/vspfiles/photos/RMT-LTT7-2T.jpg  To properly torque the connection, you'll need one of [these](http://www.techtoolsupply.com/ProductDetails.asp?ProductCode=TWAF-71630):  http://www.techtoolsupply.com/v/vspfiles/photos/TWAF-71630-2T.jpg  Congratulations, now you can hook up cable in most places.     It works in Vista too.    [MS15-078](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/security/MS15-078) is the patch for a vulnerability in Microsoft font driver that could allow remote code execution.  The security bulletin stated:  This security update resolves a vulnerability in Microsoft Windows. The vulnerability could allow remote code execution if a user opens a specially crafted document or visits an untrusted webpage that contains embedded OpenType fonts. This security update is rated Critical for all supported releases of Microsoft Windows.  Under vulnerability information, Microsoft wrote:  OpenType Font Driver Vulnerability - CVE-2015-2426  A remote code execution vulnerability exists in Microsoft Windows when the Windows Adobe Type Manager Library improperly handles specially crafted OpenType fonts. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of the affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.  There are multiple ways an attacker could exploit this vulnerability, such as by convincing a user to open a specially crafted document, or by convincing a user to visit an untrusted webpage that contains embedded OpenType fonts. The update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how the Windows Adobe Type Manager Library handles OpenType fonts.  When this security bulletin was issued, Microsoft had information to indicate that this vulnerability was public but did not have any information to indicate this vulnerability had been used to attack customers. Our analysis has shown that exploit code could be created in such a way that an attacker could consistently exploit this vulnerability.   They cannot tell what you are watching.  A TV is just a receiver, and does not transmit.  The only way they can tell if you are watching is if you have a cable company cable box.  You could watch it to your heart's content.  If caught, (doubtful), the most that will happen is they'll put a trap back on the line, and one day you'll come home and have either nothing on TV, or basic service (local broadcast channels), only.    Then just wait a week, and go outside and take off the trap yourself, and you'll have all the channels again.  You can get a terminator removal tool on eBay for like $5, and a P-key is about $15.  The chances of getting caught are nil.  **EDIT:**  Just don't report a cable TV outage. ;)   So go buy one? Ski-Doos are pretty fun, but kind of expensive. Also, it's not going to be of much use if you don't get a lot of snow.   The chances of getting caught are almost none. I hooked myself up to cable by doing exactly that over a year ago. No issues at all.   They won't let me put it on the roof, (no building modifications allowed), so I have to build a stand for it.  I can't seem to get the pole mounted to that flat piece of wood stable.   VK7JG-NPHTM-C97JM-9MPGT-3V66T   Yes.  Right click on task bar -- Cortana -- Hidden               Do I need to put up guy wires for only a 6 foot mount?  As you can tell from my attempted mount, it's not very stable.  I have it bolted on with a 9/16" lag bolt.  Do I need to put up guy wires for such a short pole?  http://imgur.com/a/WZlDv         My Eee PC 1000HD has 2GB of RAM, but only a 900 MHz processor.  I doubt Win10 would even run on it.   If you don't use Caps Lock, you can remap it to be a Windows Key.   I already created a shortcut to it on my desktop.  You can also get to it by Winkey + X, and selecting "Control Panel" on the popup menu.    However, the only way to get to Windows Update is through the new action center.  It's been removed from the legacy control panel.   "God Mode" is still available if you want it. Create a new folder (anywhere), and name it:      God Mode.{ED7BA470-8E54-465E-825C-99712043E01C}  You'll have access to everything. :)  http://i.imgur.com/9urdIHY.png [1]   I still prefer the control panel.  I only use the settings  panel to check for WU, since that's the only way to do it.  If they left the entire legacy control panel in place, I would use it exclusively.  "God Mode" is still available if you want it.  Create a new folder (anywhere), and name it:       GodMode.{ED7BA470-8E54-465E-825C-99712043E01C}  You'll have access to everything. :)  http://i.imgur.com/9urdIHY.png   That fixed the weather live tile, but didn't do anything for the secondary time that I have set up.   It works fine on the ClearQAM channels, and even some of the analog channels station ID automatically on my TV.  However, only ClearQAM has the OSTVG actually functional.   10240 **IS** RTM.  Between now, and 9 days from now, it's mostly going to be bug fixes.  Yes, you will update to the retail release, (and beyond).   You read it correctly. :)         I sort of doubt it would even run on my EeePC 1000HD.                     /r/autofellatio                         If you're activated now, you are on RTM, and the final release.  No need to re-install.

I have Debian with LXDE running on it now, and it works perfectly fine.   Nope, no red banner at all.  http://i.imgur.com/QmPBIXT.png   They're a bunch of stoner, posing, wiggers.

You will plant seed in vain, because your enemies will eat it. 17. I will set my face against you so that you will be defeated by your enemies; those who hate you will rule over you, and you will flee even when no one is pursuing you.   Depending on what build you are on.   10240 is RTM, and it's fully activated on my machine.   I actually heated my first apartment with my computer. It kept a toasty 75 F in there without any heat on.   The same reason we "video tape" something, when physical tapes haven't really been used in like 10 years, and "rewind" a DVD.      If we had an outward facing satellite, and one orbiting in geosynchronous orbit around mars, (both essentially set up as repeater routers), it would be possible.  Unfortunately, it would take 15 minutes for a one way communication.  "Instant messaging" wouldn't be so "instant" when you are talking about interplanetary distances.  It would be no faster than sending an email in the 90's and early 2000's.      Oh, don't forget "If you look directly at me, I'll punish you.  Keep your head down, and do not speak to me unless I speak to you first"  "Do as I tell you, I know better"  "Do not challenge my authority over you.  What I say, goes."  "Are you wanting to get punished?"  "Tell me you love me, or I'll hit you."  "Be quiet!" smack  "When I want your opinion, I'll give it to you."   You could always route through a proxy in advanced -- Network -- Connections -- Settings, and set up a manual proxy.  Or just route through duckduckgo.      http://i.imgur.com/YIgZLT9.jpg   Nope.

Because of the enormous weight of the towers, they have to be anchored to solid beddrock, or a large concrete slab with enough mass to prevent the tower from falling over in high winds.  After that part is done, it is built in a lattice structure, much like the core of a skyscraper is erected.  The diagonal struts add structural integrity to the tower, and make it more resistant to twisting in the wind, (or in event of an earthquake).  It is typically built from a wide base, to a narrow top where the transmission antennas are, and if extra stability is needed, guy wires are added to the tower, and angled out at a 45 degree angle for maximum torsion strength.      I've been using it as my exclusive OS since October.  It's worth it. :)   You could install [ClassicShell](http://www.classicshell.net/)  http://www.classicshell.net/images/startmenu3.png   Since it's a free upgrade, I would assume MS will provide a DL for it on Digital River like they have in the past.

"This Machine is permanently activated."      slmgr/xpr  "This Machine is permanently activated."  YAY! :)   I don't think you understand.  I don't mean just a re-install on top of an existing install, but what if I have to completly nuke my HDD?  How would that work?   No, I mean what if my installation is completely FUBAR, and I need to do a fresh install after nuking my drive?  Is there a way to do it?   You could remap the tilde button.  Kind of an odd location, but you can remap any button to do anything if you want.            Exactly.  My guns have killed less people than Ted Kennedy's car.

If you're as white as most European people, people will likely think your speaking Italian. We here in America aren't too aware of foreign languages.

You'll get the most channels.   KQQQ is still run by men, (and women), not some machine.  Well, the computers control the format, but there's a man sitting behind the machine, and can interrupt at any time.  The radio station let me go take a tour of it, and it looked **completely** different than what I was thinking it would be.  I was expecting it to be like the movie Good Morning Vietnam, it wasn't.  It blew my mind.   What if you put the antenna hieght at 35 feet?   Didn't work.  You need to copy the link they give you.  Here's my TVFool:  http://www.tvfool.com/?option=com_wrapper Itemid=29 q=id%3d8e039ebc3d6c71   I have a solution to that!  buy a P-Key.  Hook yourself up.  Problem solved.   I actually still have an analog feed to my apt.  I get digital and analog feeds, with no STB needed.  It works just as it always has.  I don't have to rent equipment, just plug it in to my TV, and do a channel scan.  Away I go.  Not a problem  I get 67 analog channels, and 25 digital.  I also have TWC.  I know this, because I hooked myself up. :)   So put up an antenna?     Radio is still the best option for emergency signals.  If you have a crank radio, (or a battery powered unit), it's much better in an emergency than a TV.  When the power is out, you don't get TV or internet, but the radio is always there.   Night watchman at a bank?   Motorola SB5101. :)   IIRC, the cost to install a speed limit sign is $550.  The cost to install one with a speed measurer thing in it?  $560.  so why not?  Hmm, come to think of it, why do speedometers use gears?  Why not shoot a radar beam directly in front of the vehicle so you know exactly how fast you're going?  It wouldn't cost any more to do the initial setup with a new vehicle.  (except it wouldn't be user serviceable).   The same way those speed limit signs on trailers with radar speed measurers are?  I actually like them, because it lets me know how accurate my speedometer is.  My radar detector lets me know about speed traps, (duh), but when I see one of those speed limit signs with a speed indicator, I drive EXACTLY the speed, and pass it, then see how accurate I am.  Go figure, if I keep my tires to manufacturers rating, I'm under.  If I inflate to the max, I'm exactly accurate. O.o.  I don't get it.   Dear god.  I only get 30 MBPS, and that's only because I uncapped my modem.  I'm paying for 20 Mbps.  I don't even know what I would use that speed for.  Downloading the entire fucking internet?   Dickhole.  I mean so I can pass it and make sure my speedeometer is calibrated correctly, (or of not, adjust my speed accordingly)  Oddly enough, since I over inflated my tires to 44 PSI, I'm actually accurate now. :)   Very true!      [Where's the beef?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6_eWWfNB54)   It was. :)  When my friend came over she asked "what are all these wires for?"  I said "Let me show you", and turned on my TV.  I had a signal as clear as cable. :)  I was in the middle of BFE, but I had a clear as signal as the town kids.  :)  When I turned on my TV, she had 2 words, "holy shit!" :)   1983*  Asshole.   I literally wired my room as a giant antenna.  I had loops, and even ran a wire on my roof to catch more signal.  If it was broadcast, I could pick it up. :)  Not a problem.  I lost the local ABC affiliate some nights when it was raining, but I had pretty good signal otherwise.  Some channels like the CW were snowy, but I could pick it up. :)  I was pissed off for 10 years because I missed the last episode of ST:V, but since now I have the internet, I already watched it, (10 years later), I'm not pissed anymore. :)  It was sleeting that night, and I couldn't pick up the local FOX affiliate.  I was pissed off, I tried everything, including going out to the camper and hooking up my TV.  Still couldn't pick it up. :(   You know you're starting to get old when the shows of your youth are aired on TV land and Nick At Night.  When I grew up, Nick At Nite played Mr Ed, and now they air "The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air", (it used to be on NBC at 1900 hrs). When I was a youth, TVLand didn't exist.  They now have a station called "Antenna TV".  I'm old enough to remember when that was the only way I could get TV.  I was living in a giant antenna, and got 2,3,4,6.7,10,12,22,24,28,35,40.  I wired my room to be a huge antenna.  One of my friends came over during the summer of 95, and saw my setup.  "Bad reception?" was her question.  "No, it's actually pretty good now, I have 12 channels now! Wanna watch TV?"   I already got counseled by a dietician in the hospital.  I now have several recipes for high calorie, high protein, high fat meals.  I just need to buy a blender.  And yes, my step mom is sort of mean, (and hits hard), but I obviously need it, or she wouldn't do it.  (Yes, I still get hit even though I'm a fully grown man).   If you see Kay, tell her I'll see you in tea.  (Fuck, Cunt)   I've been saying this for decades. "Salad is what food eats".   Pull the battery, and sit for 30s. Insert battery, start machine. Problem solved.   So they could get so stoned that they couldn't get up?   I was born in 83.  	200

 Bite my shiny metal ass   I'm a conservative.   Oooooooohhhhhhhhhhhhhhh Babe!   Haha I actually don't retain in books as much as I wish I would. But I think I may do Neverwhere then Cat's Cradle or Sirens of Titan and then Anansi Boys. Awesome.   At least it can fit into tight corners that a regular pitchfork cant!   Awesome, I thought American Gods was awesome. I vaguely remember Anansi, I think he was the spider guy? I would probably sparknote the book real quick before I read it.   I've read American Gods and Graveyard book, but that was 3-4 years ago. I'm looking forward to these books!   Alright thanks! I think I'm gonna read Neverwhere by Neil Gaiman, then Cat's Cradle next   pitches a fork   Shaq is such a likable dude, I listen to his podcast every week. Says he's an entertainer and will never turn kids down for a picture in public. He's hilarious and a great entertainer   Yeah I mean it wasn't an excruciating read, only a couple days. But yeah you're right it basically was 150 pages. Maybe I just need to get more used to his style/prose so I can appreciate it more   I don't know how long it's been since you read BoC, but is the main character Vonnegut and the real life things he mentions, actually in his life?   Thanks! My buddy has Sirens of Titan, so he is gonna lend it out to me when school starts back up!   Interesting. Thanks, I'll probably do that in the order you said, does he keep a lot of recurring characters?   My friend also recommended Siren of Titan, how does that compare?   So I understood all the America satire that Vonnegut was using, but am I wrong to think that it was really long-winded? After reading the 300 page book, I couldn't help but think that it could have been 150 pages. I want to read more Vonnegut, but I don't know if it's going to be more of the same or not. I read a brief description of Cat's Cradle and Slaughterhouse-five and they both sounded like American Satires, PLEASE CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG.   I would like to know if I should keep on going, or maybe I missed something completely with the book that went over my head.   Awesome, yeah that's the extent I know of it haha. Cheers.   I really liked the Sonmi-451 story a lot. I love futuristic, sci-fi like that. I liked Sonmi, and I thought Timothy Cavendish's story was hilarious.   The Old Man and the Sea had me hooked, fairly short book that I couldn't put down and finished it the same day I started it.   Did you like Cat's Cradle? I haven't read it, but only hear positives about it. I just finished Breakfast of Champions today, it's an easy read, took me about 3-4 days to read. Lots of American satire, as usual.    Ah! Just the thread I was looking for, I was about to make a separate post. Okay, so I just started reading Neverwhere, what a coincidence. It says that it has similarities to Alice In Wonderland. How pivotal is that to the enjoyment of the story? Because I have never read/watched Alice In Wonderland. I've read Graveyard Book by Neil, even though I never read Jungle Book. Will there be any issues?   I saw the guy that runs SETI speak when he came to WVU, I'm stoked!   Wow, it seems like yesterday it came out. I like that comment about backing vocalist haha. Actually, in some respects, John has a better voice than Anthony.   I think that album has some of John Frusciante's best work, including some of his solo stuff. He's one of the guitarists that is just so in-tune with their sound that you can't separate them.   I always love that during Gilmour's solos when he doesn't play a lot of notes I succession, but he has them long and strung out. Most notably in Time and the 2nd solo in Comfortably Numb. He also does it in echoes. I love guitar solos in that fashion, also explains why Wet Sand by RHCP is one of my favorite songs ever.   I love it! I feel like more people are against it than like it. There are a few shitty lyrics like "let's go do it" and the parts that sound like that. But the rest is catchy and fun to sing to. The chorus gets stuck in my head like a bug.  Also, I guess this "technically" the first post-Floyd solo album. Obviously the argument could be made and roger and yada yada yada. But it's just a thought.   THERE AREN'T OVER 50 PRESIDENTS, PLS   Damn shame, Nien has been playing so well in recent weeks after every getting dumpstered in the first few weeks.

A lot of this consensus on this sub is that Obscured by Clouds is one of the most underrated albums, but that depends on the person. I actually don't listen to this album as much as should, I like all the songs, except I don't really listen to Alan's Psychedelic Breakfast.

THIS ISN'T THE APPROPRIATE SUBREDDIT FOR THAT. THIS IS JUST TO SHARE A PF QUOTE FROM HIS BOOK.  That being said. As I was reading through Rand Paul's book, "Taking A Stand" he referenced Pink Floyd and I thought it might be cool to share with you guys.   Pink Floyd understood that genius needs to be left alone. Whether your ideas are politically correct or not, whether you're a painter or self-proclaimed prophet, the exhortation is to shine, to not let conformity dim your light: "Shine on, you crazy diamond."     well my two degrees are very intertwined so it's not as bad as it seems. It would be bad if I were aerospace and civil engineering for instance.   We're lifting off severe sanctions on them that equate to around $800 billion, I believe. It opens them to more trade. We're also allowing them to develop nuclear weapons because our restrictions on that are basically nonexistent.

I'll try to give you the conservative view point since lots and lots of other redditors will give you their view in a flash. It really should be a non-partisan issue but I assume it comes with one party taking credit for the deal rather than the other. Anyway, from my view, this deal does nothing to perturb Iran from gaining a nuclear weapon. They closed down thousands of centrifuges, but they still have 5000 running. It took Pakistan 3000 to develop a bomb. Iran has also funded terrorism in the region. Just early in the week they were burning American flags and saying death to America. The equivalent of lifting their trade restrictions is like a country giving the US $8 Trillion. They also have four american hostages, 1 of whine we know has been tortured. He was running an underground Christian church.   They are radicals and I don't think I see many benefits from this deal.  EDIT: Their places can only be inspected if given 14 days notice. It can also only be inspected by Iran's allies or something similar (I'm blanking, sorry). So US inspectors aren't allowed in.

 It just raises so many questions.  What is it?  Why does it only have one arm?  What is that thing growing out of its head?  Why does that thing look evil?

They can tell you where to get measured near you.  http://dehner.com/   Wonderful!  I love seeing other saddleseat folks on here. :)   Upvote for sexy forearms, AND upvote for the Cubs. :)   Since you don't do the processing afterwards, do the jars seal shut?  And how long to these keep?  Do you have to keep them refrigerated?  Sorry for all the questions but I tried to make pickles last hear and they were HORRIBLE, so I want to make awesome ones this year. :)      Turtrucken?   "In our constitution there are many rights: the right to housing, the right to education, the right to health. But I don't find the right to park." -  Enrique Pealosa, former mayor of Bogota, Colombia  People act like parking is some kind of right they have wherever they go, and if it isn't available there needs to be an "improvement." I, however, see removing parking as an improvement.

I'm a 2008 alum too, and I'm considering moving from my current 2 bedroom.  Could you PM me some details about your property?      Best high horse picture ever!!!   My mom was cleaning out the pantry around Christmas and found a box of Ziploc baggies with the VR Troopers on them.  She is using them for EVERYTHING.   I find that if I eat solid food before I show it doesn't sit well -- enter Organic Valley single serve chocolate milk boxes!  They're like juice boxes but full of milk, and they don't have to be refrigerated!  The combination of protein and a bit of sugar and fat gets me through my ride.  After that I eat ANYTHING.     My trainer once forgot that I don't weigh much and threw me over the other side of the horse!      So much love!!!   There's one of these in my hometown that my dad helped build.  They're tearing it down soon and replacing it with something more "modern.". So sad.   I still have my Ninjor action figure.    Hi everyone.  I have a little side business called Bling for the Ring that sells vintage stock pins and lapel pins, offering riders something unique to accessorize with.  I sell primarily in the Morgan and Saddlebred world, since those are the breeds I show with, but would love to tap into the Hunter/Jumper, Dressage, and Arab worlds.    Does anyone know of any message boards where I could post, facebook pages I could like, or any other ways to reach out to these disciplines/breeds?  I have an Etsy page and can ship internationally, so the sky's the limit!!!    Any help would be great.  If you're curious about what I'm selling, my Etsy page is here: https://www.etsy.com/shop/blingforthering  Thank you all in advance!      What a beautiful girl, and what a long life!  Do you have any of her tail hair?  When my horse passed I got a necklace made of her tail hair braided together with some of her son's hair.  It is one of my most treasured possessions.    And now we are dating!  *swoons over /u/manifest_reverie*   Pita's cake is almost as cute as he is!    Yes!!!  And now I even remember that theme music.  Now I want to watch it...   I'm dying to remember the name of the show with the two cats dressed in blue and red (left edge).  Does anyone remember?  I recall loving that show.   Rhinoceros pin?  Interesting... the 90's were a special time.   This is awesome!  Thank you!   I "awwww"ed out loud!   Hair ribbons have been claimed.  Thank you!   I've has these forever and never used them.  My mom got them before she realized they weren't used in saddleseat.  One is black, one is forest green, and one is navy.  I'll gladly mail them to whoever might be able to use them!  I just feel bad throwing them out when they could be used.  Just PM me!      Amazing work!  And your fiance is a mega ladyboner.      Where in IL?  I'll be driving to Rockford.      Max is brave!  My horse thinks cows are going to kill him in his sleep or something.   I am crying tears because you have a fiancee.  :(   I'm more interested in the sign that appears to have a guy Irish stepdancing on it.    I want to know about the Pegasus fabric!  What the hell is that?   My mom still does her Tae-Bo religiously.  In her defense, it's working.  She looks incredible for 66.   I always got stuck in that hamburger cop thing.  I don't know why, but I could never figure out how to get out of the part with the bars, and my mom would have to somehow pry me out.   I was just stuck in traffic.  Looks like they're off the highway now, but there's still a major gapers block.  Northbound is worse than southbound.   Bun Mi if he's into Vietnamese sandwiches.  They are crazy tasty.   From one pineapple-themed username to another, I salute you.   I miss when they used to actually stamp the date into the end of the can instead of printing it on, and then you could get the coveted end slice with the date on it.  Mmm...cranberry numbers.   That underground village shopping area is the stuff of nightmares.  I remember similar places like that from when I was a kid.  I still have a fear of places that are made to look like the outside but are inside.  Not sure if there's word for that phobia...   Wonderful, thank you!  Will you be going?  We could make it the world's smallest Reddit meetup.  :)   Any details on when and where?  I'm a historic preservation professional and I'd love to go.      The orange scent was my favorite too!  I used to scratch it really sparingly to save it. :). In fact...I still do.   Nope, Minnesota.   People do jump in there, so I think it's a pretty standard height.   I want to ride Buster!  I would look like a flea on a dog's back up there!   It's not oddly short, so it must be the angle and Scooter's giantness. :)  	61
    google it, it comes up in a lot of places                                                            have you READ brietbart????                  dude, the entire POINT of the civil war was to defend slavery. the stars and bars was the flag of the confederacy. ergo, it's fucking racist.            riiiiiiiiight, because a flag that stands for the segregation of the races is TOTALLY equal to a flag that represents a minority who have been hunted, killed, discriminated against, bullied to the point of suicide, shunned, banished, tortured, and hounded so far deep in the closet that we're sucking dick and licking pussy in Narnia.  totally equivalent.                               It's Breitbart, Poe's Law applies to the entire site                                                               yeah, but at least bernie can shift the party's priorities to the left. dont forget, hillary DID try to get health care coverage. she'll most likely push for single payer, prolly towards the end of her second term, when the dems have won back the house             I guess I'm worried that I'll make this choice, and then regret it. Or not do it and never be happy...  ah, the eternal dilemma of a trans person. damned if you do, damned if you dont. that's something i struggled with for the better part of 30 years (i've known since i was 7, came out when i was 39)  i dont have much to offer, except that as much as i pushed it away, and LORD knows i tried my hardest, it always came back with a vengeance. i just ran out of energy to fight it, and gave into the NEED to be a girl.  i'm much happier now, but i had to go thru a whole lot of shit to figure that out. i envy the kids who just know, and fight like hell to come out.    HUG   i dont envy you the choice you have to make, and i wish i could offer more advice than "i'm sending positive vibes". but that's part of the journey that each of us has to figure out on our own.

ONLY because it's better to transition under medical supervision. that being said, i also know MANY trans people who dont have access to a doctor to transition and who have gone down the road of DIY. they know the risks they're taking, and i will assume that you do too.   ha, my endo had me on duta, but my T was so low that i didnt really need it, the estrogen was enuff to suppress the eveel T.  anyways, CanadaDrugs has 60 for $96                  lol                     oh they're completely disgusting, ANYONE who would use brennan as a spokesperson loses any and all credibility with me.  i'm just saying that there ARE people who detransition, and their trans journey is just as valid as ours.   The problem here is that Cummings and Lopez are trying to impose THEIR outlook as the only one true way. I'm sure it seems that way to them, but it's wrong. wrong in every way it can possibly be.         whoa, hold on now, i disagree with the message in the article that we should all just "accept the gender we were born with" but i know a few people who have de-transitioned. there's no one way to be trans, we each experience it a different way.          you have a point                                                      THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS ARENT SOMETHING YOU MAKE FUN OF!

 Ive had insomnia almost my entire life, it is extremely difficult for me to fall asleep. But imagine insomnia mixed with the fact my neighbours have 2 dogs, very large dogs at that. Each of them looking like they weigh about 150 Kilograms each. Yeah thats how large they are. They also have a tremendously loud bark. A bark loud enough to wake a bear out of hibernation. When do you think they like to bark the most? Thats correct. 2 A.M, mixed with my insomnia, sleep barely crosses my mind, not even for a second.  I require much medication for my insomnia, prescribed by a doctor, of course. I walked down the steps in pure darkness. Dark is not a fear of mine, in fact its more of my friend as I am quite an unsocial person. I dont enjoy people, they speak and have feelings. Although, personally I am quite amazing. The cabinet where my medication is, is in the bathroom. Ive never liked the bathroom, that walls have a weird pattern that would make someone with OCD lose their mind and go mad. I take my meds at double doses, my personal idea as normal doses make me see stuff thats not there in reality.  My house has a giant forest behind it that the children in the neighbourhood enjoy playing in. Its quite dense, perfect for seclusion. That forest contains many secrets, past and present, some are mine. But thats a story for another day. The infernal dog barking causes me to have a migraine.  I head back to my small bedroom and hide myself beneath layers of blankets to try and block out the sound of the dogs barking. Its impossible, the more layers, the louder the barking.  Due to the dogs barking I dont sleep. I check the alarm clock beside my bed on the nightstand. It reads 2:31 AM. I sigh, get up and head into the study. I open up my desktop and check my Steam activity. Of course nothing I have no friends on Steam. But as usual just another trade bot messages me every 10 seconds. I shut down the computer and sit in darkness for 10 minutes.  The barking continues. I cant hold out. I have to check what this infernal barking is directed towards. I head down the same stairs and catch sight of a lone light outside the window of my house. Someone left a note, a torch and a bicycle. Here is a picture of the bike by the way http://i.imgur.com/uexqWNJ.jpg  The note reads, Happy Anniversary! This confuses me deeply as well as sparking curiosity at what the torch was pointing towards the forest. Its not the perfect weather or time for a forest stroll, but I have nothing else to do. I head down a steep hill, there is a single set of footprints that go from my position to a cave carved into the side of a hill near a drain pipe.  I shine my torch into the drain pipe and see nothing out of the ordinary. I flash my torch into the cave. I catch a whiff of a foul odour being emitted from something or someone from the cave. I move away all of the foliage covering my entrance to the cave. I put down my torch.  I point it inwards into the cave.  I see the remains of a decaying human skeleton  Hey Dan I whisper. Happy Anniversary!    It's mixing my favorite game with my favorite basketball team. I need it.   The dead body in my car.   The last 30 minutes of the final episode sure were rushed.   But... We saw in the E3 gameplay, the player picked up the Pip Boy off of a dead vault scientist... So you have to be inside.   Sutter likes symbolism, maybe Abel and Thomas would become members of Sons of Anarchy because they were *the sons of anarchy*.   Here's my list:  [This song contains a video spoiler](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4jG3QJKYR0)  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lin6bvMMooE The fact they used this song in the first episode and the last made it even better.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qsk7coyzG0A Again, when they played this topped the cake.   The scene that goes with it made it insanely awesome.   I believe Kurt wanted to end on hope, that's why we see Abel playing with the ring in the car.   My favourite part about the ending of that season, as he walks out after saying he doesn't like the mayor, he says "And the good guys need a win."    I believe Abel would only have to wield the weight. As Gemma said in one scene, Abel was going to be a son, Thomas was going to be different. In one of the last scenes, Abel is seen playing with the 'Son' ring given to him by Gemma the episode before. So my theory is Abel grew up to follow in Jax's footsteps, and basically the story repeats. You might never know, Wendy could of came back, married a Son then Thomas could've died. The story could basically repeat itself.   No the Reaper is the homeless lady. She tells Jax "It's time" right before he kills August Marks. I believe Jax was supposed to represent Jesus, the food the homeless lady was eating was bread, aswell as drinking wine. This represents the last supper as 2 items present at the the table. Then after Jax collides with the truck we see 2 crows pecking at a piece of bread on the side of the road, we then hear the collision confirming Jax's death. The crows fly away, Jax's blood touches the bread. It was Jax's last supper.   No man can outmatch my stealth skills aswell as my skills in unarmed combat. I will best any man I come across.      I threw my keyboard out the window and smashed it.   One playthough I went full unarmed, basically one hitted Enclave soldiers that were wearing power amor. Was not disappointed.   A dead body   EB Games (Australia)   Oh no. You missed the medicine one, looks like you can't get them all   One time I had unarmed at 100, and was using my fists to punch and I killed a Enclave Soldier with 1 hit... (Fallout 3)   A door that was designed to never open... ever. Although there is a secret entrance to the Vault, only accessible from the outside.  	21
    Lorber was criticized for never publishing these findings in a peer-reviewed journal though. I would be a bit skeptical about his claims.       With the exception of 1976 and the three-party elections of the Bill Clinton Era, when the Democratic share of the vote actually went down, but Clinton won some Southern states due to Perot, the GOP swept the field in the South after 1964. The democratic share of the congressional delegations from the south more gradually deteriorated as incumbents held on, often by becoming Republicans in all but name (Zell Miller comes to mind.)  The whole discussion is confused by the fact that the political parties were not as ideologically aligned back then as they are now. There were plenty of Republicans more liberal than most Southern Democrats.    Those links show exactly the trend I was talking about... there was clearly a shift in the Republican attitude towards Civil Rights after Goldwater won the nomination in '64 and then with Nixon's Southern Strategy (yes, 5 deep southern states went for Wallace, but the rest went for Nixon.)   The racist white southerners voted for Democrats locally and at the State level but GOP at the national level? For Senators and Congressmen?  Correct. That voting pattern persisted for decades and is well-documented.  30 out of 32 GOP Senators voted for the CRA.  What CRA are you talking about? The Community Reinvestment Act?  Why would racist white southerners vote for Democrats locally who didn't push civil rights but a national GOP that did?  Because the GOP was to the right of the Democrats on Civil Rights on a national level after 1964. Goldwater and Nixon were seen as being more sympathetic to Southern white "interests" than LBJ and Humphrey.   P.S. LBJ was a southern Democrat  So was Al Gore. Politics is strange.    Because Civil Rights wasn't pushed at the state level by Southern Democrats, inertia and incumbency kept many of them in office for decades.    1) The Republican party lost the the black American vote over civil rights in the 60's.   More accurately, the Democratic Party lost the *white* Southern vote in the 60's due to Civil Rights, then the GOP lost the black vote as they swept in to pick up those voters. At the time, the Republicans were trading a smaller voting bloc for a bigger one. Smart politics. At the time. But karma's a bitch.      Not necessarily. To be regarded as scientifically valid, a phenomenon needs to be replicable. Most reports of "supernatural" phenomena indicate an unpredictable and sporadic pattern of occurrence. A person might claim to experience precognition, or see a "ghost" once or twice in a lifetime. This could very well be because such phenomena do not in fact exist, and are the result of malfunctioning brains or sense organs, but if they do exist, this unpredictable pattern could be why they have never been scientifically proven.  Another thing to consider is the relationship between subjective states and physical objects. Some subjective states (for example, seeing the color red) have a physical correlate (an object that emits light in the red wavelengths). These states can thus be studied by science in an indirect manner since their causes are known, even if the exact relationship between the object and the subjective state it engenders is still a matter of fierce debate.  However, if there are subjective states that *do not* have a physical correlate, than these states might forever be outside the realm of scientific examination. Examples might include mystical experiences, the feeling of subtle energies such as chi or prana, etc.  Science can certainly observe the brainwaves of people who claim to be experiencing such states, but that is different from directly studying the (potentially supernatural) *object* that could be engendering these states. Note how this is unlike studying a brain that is seeing a color red, where the object emitting the light can be directly observed.  None of this proves anything about the actual existence of the supernatural of course, it merely casts doubts on those who believe that science itself is an "all-seeing eye" with a truly universal method for obtaining knowledge.  I think these considerations answer your second question as well: Science has no choice but to assume that only naturalistic phenomena are at work because its method can see nothing else.             "Actually collect taxes" would be good, but it's difficult. There is actually a clause in the Greek constitution preventing the taxing of shipping. Guess what the biggest industry in Greece is? Therefore Greece relies heavily on sales taxes, and even taxes on utility bills, which fall most heavily on the poor.  Some labor market reforms are called for, but severely cutting the pensions of people who are already retired, and often supporting multiple unemployed adult offspring, will only be counterproductive.   "Reforms" that would privatize major public assets and hand them over to the same banks that defrauded the Greek people (and the EU) to get them in to the Euro in the first place. I wouldn't have stomach for that either.   From a Libertarian perspective that most people here (including me) will not agree with, but I thought this was interesting nonetheless.         You do know the article was about the *Chinese* stock market, right?      The characters in the originals (save maybe Thunderdome) seemed more demented to me than camp, like you would expect the survivors to be after a nuclear war. The re-make was overtly, mockingly camp and it turned me off.         That happened to me once, but it was during hypnogogia not SP (which I've never had.) It was a really complex classical music piece that I didn't remember ever hearing before. I still wonder where it came from and how it just happened to pop into my head.     how does it benefit me, personally, to have my tax dollars sent to Mississippi?   So that Mississippi, or some sort of neo-Confederacy more likely, does not have independent control of nuclear weapons and leaders with End Times belief systems.   Reddit and Wikipedia have opposite problems. Reddit has good volunteers and an out-of-touch paid staff. Wikipedia is the opposite, at least that was the case a few years ago when I finally gave up over there.      For most people, nothing comes after Calc. Figure out what you want to do in terms of a career first before you worry about that.    They used their own stock as collateral for bank loans. Jesus Christ.  That practice is not limited to China...   I think you're on to something here. The Chinese leadership might be evil, but they don't have a track record of this kind of blatant stupidity.   This is the first explanation of this move that I've seen that even halfway makes sense, and that manipulation is documented already in the case of Hanergy, where the CEO was borrowing from shady shell companies he controlled so he could buy more of his own stock every time the price threatened to go down. It wouldn't surprise me if this scam was a lot more widespread than has been reported.             I used to do this as a kid - nothing mysterious about it though. Kids are very light and nimble: I would "jump" off the top step and just kind of hop down, barely touching the outside edge of every step on the way. It felt like I was gliding down on an escalator.  One time it went wrong and I rolled my ankle.      How is that an argument for fiat currency?      I realize the Mises Institute isn't exactly unbiased when it comes to the gold issue, but I thought this was a fascinating article.         I see some of the first comments are for people who lived in ancient times whose lives weren't really well-documented. I would like some examples from the past century or two if possible!      If you have a deposit in a bank, you are a creditor of that bank. If the bank cannot meet its obligations, expect to lose part of your investment (unless it is insured.) Bank accounts are NOT cash that is being "held" somewhere.   Never knew this had a name. Pretty cool. Also pretty cool to see a mainstream media outlet discussing the paranormal without the usual sneering dismissal. My wife experienced one of these when her grandmother passed away. Not conclusive proof of anything in my book, but certainly something that warrants further investigation. Unfortunately the scientific method is not geared to look into sporadic phenomena such as this.   It's a shame because they were ahead of the curve on a lot of issues, but they ruin all their credibility with juvenile posts and over-the-top "the world is ending" stuff. I'm not sure if there is any editorial control at ZH at all - there doesn't seem to be.   The Yoga Sutras are old enough (c. 400 AD) to qualify as "ancient" by most people's definition of the word, and they draw upon an obviously older tradition. The 84 classic poses, some of which you will learn in an intro class, have been codified for well over 1,000 years.  A lot of the "fad" yogas ("hot" yoga, dog yoga for chrissakes) are recent inventions, but yoga itself is a very old tradition. This idea that yoga is some modern invention is just [intellectual hipsterism](http://lesswrong.com/lw/2pv/intellectual_hipsters_and_metacontrarianism/).   That "treatment" was used in the past and failed, most famously on an unwilling Alan Turing. Gays have normal levels of testosterone, etc.    If there ever is a way to "simulate" minds from the past, I'm sure his would be one of the first one the list.   There is some speculation (and it is only speculation), that GID might be tied to long-term use of drugs that influence hormone pathways, including steroids. In addition to Jenner who everyone's talking about, I remember a Navy SEAL and a champion mountain climber being in the news recently for going from super-"macho" men to wanting to become women. Anecdotal evidence to be sure, but interesting nonetheless.   It is also that many priests in the past tended to be closeted homosexuals who joined the clergy so no one would question why they remained unmarried. If they chose to act on their desires at all, often the only available (and vulnerable) population was underage boys.   Technically that is "homosexual predation" rather than "classical" pedophilia, but you will never hear right-wingers mention the context surrounding it. Instead they want you to think that gays are inherently predatory regardless of their social circumstances.    I was at a Law School graduation recently, and people were whooping and hollering worse than any High School graduation I've been to. Bet none of them got served with warrants.   Only the "Dark Knight" movie itself was, the other two movies in the Trilogy were so-so (the first one) and awful (the third.)   I thought the originals were far better. I agree the implied back-story was done well, but the guitar dude turned the whole thing into camp, which the original two films certainly were not (Thunderdome had some Return of the Jedi-esque forshadowing to Fury Road's corniness.)            We still have never figured out how he knew.   License plate scanners were just coming into use around that time, he could have had access to that. Now, if a cop pulls you over, he can see exactly where you've been unless you've been out in the middle of nowhere. There could have been a scanner at the concert to look for drug activity.    ...and since he "died" before his sentencing, his family got to keep all of his ill-gotten gains. I would look in the Caribbean or Switzerland before assuming he's got a cottage up there with Jeb.  On the other hand, his second-in-command Skilling who seemed the smarter of the two actually did some serious jail time, so he probably really did die of a heart attack from the stress of the trial. Nice plot arc for a soap opera though.   Yep. The ones with a nice, predictable "twist" at the end immediately arouse my skepticism. This one, if it is is fake, is an incredibly unique and chilling story that doesn't give off the "spooky movie" vibe. I can't believe it didn't get more upvotes.      Good point - I should have said objects that can be satisfactorily approximated by spheres.    It means that we can't think of infinite sets as "menus" where you can freely pick an element like we can with finite sets. Some go further and say that the whole idea of infinite sets is incoherent.   My position is that infinite sets are good approximations of things that are very large but in reality finite. We can "use" infinite sets in applied mathematics with little reservation, but we should not take them "literally" as representations of physical objects like spheres.      Depends on the state. In my state it is not required and there is one (wealthy) district nearby that does not provide bus service - parents are expected to carpool (or hire a taxi/towncar).   Dialed in? Locked in?      Whoops, sorry, forgot to actually link to the article!   I've read a good deal of Hegel and he would probably say something quite similar to your explanation. Now that you've expounded more on your point I can say I agree.     This is barely relevant,   You are too modest sir...  yet "something" would be similarly empty--it would be merely static existence.  Good post and I agree with 95% of what you wrote, but I think we need to explore this statement a little more - why would an "absolute" something be static?     Quantum physics shows that vacuum states are unstable, and while this is very interesting, it doesn't tell us why there is something rather than nothing, and if we feign that it does by defining "nothing" as vacuum states, or something like this, then we're guilty of a fallacy of equivocation.  Good point, and actually one I've made elsewhere, pointing out that Leonard Krauss commits this fallacy. To clear up what I meant, QM "nothing" is obviously not an *absolute* "nothing" with no laws, no physical objects, etc., but the fact that the state as close as you can get to "nothingness" within that system is unstable is suggestive of the theory that "nothingness" within *any* system, even a necessarily true one like formal logic, is also unstable. Not a proof of this assertion by any means, but suggestive none the less.  How can something be both necessarily true and contradictory, i.e. necessarily false?   Logic is necessarily true, but it's not necessarily contradictory. It's only contradictory if we allow it to refer only to itself.   Also, why should not having "a final referent to something that's not a logical statement" make a logical statement contradictory?  If logical statements refer only to themselves, eventually they will form a self-referential loop with all the self-reference paradoxes arising. Many attempts to axiomatize logic put limits on logical self-reference, but this requires a ultimate "ground" or referrent that is not itself a logical statement.  But if we re-frame consciousness as being primarily about choice... Then we're just changing the subject.  I think there's a connection - [see my reply to OP here](http://www.reddit.com/r/PhilosophyofScience/comments/32kp1i/the_connection_between_the_origin_of_matter_and/cqcxfj9).   I'm having a hard time conceiving of what you mean from a hard materialist position. Do you have anything else you could say about it?  It's hard to stay a "hard materialist" once you start contemplating these questions, in my opinion. Basically there needs to be some sort of free agent to make the primordial choice for what exists. It doesn't follow that this is a conventional "God" in any sense, however. It could be more like Schopenhauer's Will.   I'm not familiar with these, what are they? I can also look it up myself of course but I'd love to hear your thoughts if you don't mind.   The multiverse theory holds that this not the only Universe, there are other Universes out there, perhaps with their own laws of physics, etc.  As for the paradoxes of the actual infinite, you can start with Hilbert's Hotel or the fact that the infinite sum of the series 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 +.... actually equals negative 1 if we assume you can actually do "infinite sums" instead of treating them as approximations of very large but finite operations.    I've recently realized that "why is there something rather than nothing?" is actually the *easy* question of fundamental ontogeny. While scientists and philosophers don't have an exact answer yet, it is obvious that somehow "nothingness" is unstable/impossible, as seen in Quantum Physics.  My own personal preference is for the theory is that formal logic is necessarily true, but also contradictory if it doesn't have a final referent to something that's not a logical statement (that is, a material object or something like it rather than an abstraction like a rule of logic.) This creates a need for a "necessary object."  So if what was called the Ultimate Question is really the easy question, then what's the hard question? It has to be why *this particular* something, rather than any of the other possibilities that might have served as adequate necessary objects.  Even if we live as part of a "multiverse," this doesn't solve the problem, as there can be only a finite number of universes, or else all the logical contradictions of Actual Infinities would arise.  What does any of this have to do with consciousness? Not too much, if we define consciousness in terms of awareness, qualia, etc. But if we re-frame consciousness as being primarily about *choice*, with those other qualities emerging later as consequences, then I think we're on to something.   Awesome reply, thanks, that's what I was looking for.   Thanks for the reply. I think my question is a little more philosophical. If there is no "master clock" for the Universe, then how can we say that the Universe as a whole has an age? Is 13.7 billion years just the age as it appears to us because of our "position" in spacetime, or is it somehow an absolute age?   See here for more info: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brabant_killers   Probably the case. Most likely the boat was happened upon in open waters by a Chinese vessel that was fishing illegally in the area. Because they were poaching, the Chinese crew did not report finding a body, but they still gave it a proper burial in their custom, and even thought to leave the jawbone above ground for easy dental identification.   Did he mean the bailout (TARP) or the stimulus (ARRA)? These are two different issues and economists might reject the former but embrace the latter (or vice versa.)   Do you mean did I create the chart? No, I did not.            Is it that the Universe is only this old from our perspective, or is that that this dating is a simplification of a more complicated reality?               How is it guaranteed that such a function exists? He says that all predicates have a fixed point like this but he doesn't really go into it. I found that confusing because among ordinary "mathematical" functions, not all of them have fixed points.   I am trying to make my way through Yanofsky's "Outer Limits of Reason" and I am on the section about the Incompleteness Theorems. I was following his argument pretty well until it got to the following:  He defines a predicate as a function that takes a number as an input and gives a logical value (true or false) as its output.  He then defines a fixed point of a predicate F(x) as a logical statement C such that F("C")=C, where "C" is the Gdel Number of C.  It appears that our predicate F(x) now outputs a logical *statement* instead of a logical *value*. Am I missing something here or is the author being sloppy in his explanation?  (This is all on p. 320 - 322 if you want to do a Google Book search.)   What type of argument does he make for that assertion? I can think of so much evidence against it: Optical illusions, the scientific evidence that qualia (whatever they are) vary between individuals who speak different languages, etc.   I don't think that Rupert Sheldrake accepts the reality of physical objects at all, but I'm not sure. I don't know much about his work other than the controversial "dogs know when you're coming home" stuff, unless you're referring to a different Sheldrake.   Actually I have immediate mental images for all of those, but even if we accept that point, do reports of qualia seem to be referring to functional roles, or to images?   Seems most likely to me that any solution would involve tapping "dark energy" directly, if it exists. It is speculation to be sure but it's never too early to get started on a problem this big!   Summary: Although psychedelics can induce temporary confusion and emotional turmoil, hospitalizations and serious injuries are extremely rare. Overall psychedelics are not particularly dangerous when compared with other common activities, says Krebs.      I don't think this representation would arise without an actual sensation behind it. Representations can refer to "imaginary" objects, but I don't see how they can refer to things that are not even subjectively real. I can't talk about pink unicorns without actual mental images behind those words, even though there are no such things in physical reality. Even contradictions like "square circles" refer to actual sensations, although each term is distinct from the other.   Then G still exists as a semblance. Since qualia are nothing but semblances or appearances anyway, G exists as a quale.      Penrose Triangles don't exist as physical objects, but they do exist as sensations. No one is claiming that qualia are anything but sensations. Anything that "resembles" a quale is a quale, since it is nothing but a sensation anyway.   If qualia don't exist as subjective phenomena, why do we have a name for them? It is hard to see how the concept of qualia arose if there aren't any.   Dismissing qualia as an "illusion" doesn't really help solve the problem. Everyone accepts that qualia are illusions in some sense in that they are not inherent in physical objects. The question is why this type of "illusion" arises and is perceived.   They can't even stamp out marijuana after 70 years, what hope do they have versus something like ayahuasca? A crackdown would only help to make it more famous. Imagine all the Hollywood celebrities speaking out about the poor shamans in the rain forest getting sprayed with herbicide from DEA planes simply for practicing their ancestral religion.    My ex went to a school that as a matter of *policy* would not hire its own graduates, as it would "look bad" if they were working for the school rather than in the private sector.       I am not sure how long the effects of a MAO inhibitor stay in your system. Look, if they really wanted to ban it, they could, but they don't. No one "serious" sees it as a threat yet. By the time they do, it will be far too late.        obligatory drug tests after traveling from certain areas..  DMT doesn't stay in the system long enough for that.            To kick things off, I am going to submit a bunch of links that got tagged or deleted off of other subs for petty reasons. I am sick of this and I would hate to see reddit turn into another Wikipedia where people are afraid to contribute anymore.      I think the cat (or perhaps the jaguar in this case) is out of the bag. Uncle Sam might try to co-opt it, but it's too late to contain it.             Thought this was fascinating - my impression was that the Little Ice Age was well-established history -apparently not.      Shocking that this appeared in the Wall Street Journal...               People tend to confuse your typical American Masons, whose mystical objects of worship don't seem to extend far beyond the buffet table and the beer stein, with the serious Manly Hall-esque guys. Both exist although I think the serious types are in decline. The former only seems to exist to provide dues money and PR cover for the activities of the latter.     ..Who had a bunch of human bones buried under his house, discovered in 1998.  Probably from conducting underground anatomy lessons. Dissecting human cadavers was illegal at the time. Medical students would actually rob graveyards or pay others to do so in order to practice surgeries.   Do you have a reference for this?      I was thinking about doing that, but free checking accounts are actually quite rare these days.             Interesting - why would I have to buy an altcoin first?   I meant the combo of routing+account number, obviously.      If there is fraud on a credit card, isn't the card company liable for the fraud, not the merchant? Or is it that because of fraud, credit card companies won't deal with Coinbase?   I have fraud protection through Visa on my credit card, but I don't think the same protections would apply if someone had my routing numbers. I could be wrong - not an area where I am an expert, so that is part of why I'm wary.   Ok, but then why don't they just let me use a credit card? Basic prudence dictates you just don't give out your bank routing numbers to people.   Sorry if this is the wrong place for this type of question.  Edit: Thanks everyone for the detailed advice. Lots to consider!      Source is most likely David Icke who is shockingly looking a *little* less crazy than he did before this story broke (though I still don't believe in Lizardmen.)

You just linked to a graph from 2011.          In the long run, though, that's suppressing demand and driving yields even lower  I agree with everything else you said, but wouldn't suppressing demand pressure yields *higher*? That point is not really significant to your overall argument since, as praxulus says below, the bottom 50% have hardly any wealth to invest, just trying to understand why you said this would drive yields lower.   People hate not winning the war quickly and cheaply as it was sold to them.         Doesn't this contradict a lot of evidence that violence was very common in the Paleolithic? I find it hard to believe that all those combat-looking wounds in Paleolithic skeletons were caused by ritual cannibalism.  A world free from war and violence is something we want for the future - we should not delude ourselves that it existed in the past.    Well, it's a very long story that only gets weirder  That, sir, is called teasing. I am up for the long version for sure.   New Age convention in town?

He complains that billionaires should have to pay more taxes. But there is nothing stopping him from paying what he thinks is fair. He doesn't do that though.  No, he's just giving everything to charity.

Pick any number. Let's use 30:  2 is a factor of 30. But the next number after 30 that's a multiple of 2 is 32...  3 is a factor of 30 too. But the next number after 30 that's a multiple of 3 is 33...  ...and so on.  See what happens? Poor old 31 is always left out. It can't ever share any factors with 30 (other than 1 of course.)  As for a formal proof, take any whole number "x" such that x1 and x is a factor of n.   Since x is a factor of "n", then n/x is a whole number.   But what about (n+1)? Well, for "n+1" to have "x" as a factor (n+1)/x would have to be a whole number. But distributing the division in the previous statement yields n/x+1/x.   We already showed that n/x is a whole number, and 1/x is obviously not a whole number (since x1), and a whole number plus a non-whole number is never a whole number.   must be fire ants this time                  Superhuman or not, training alone like that is really stupid.

    I'd do a lot of the same things I'd do with a duck, it being a fatty bird. The last time I cooked through an entire duck I cooked the following:  Rendered Duck Fat (to make anything you'd need fat in--eggs, biscuits, etc) Duck Confit (shred off the bone + add to whatever--you can even make nuggets :) or a shepards pie style dish ) Pate Broth   RESPECT   it was the richest thing I've ever made/consumed      Basically a snicker doodle with way more cinnamon!

This made me and my wife laugh pretty damn hard.  A must-see for young men.   Wife and step-daughter lived with my in-laws.

Edit: Working peoples' tax dollars... and most working people don't qualify for "free" government anything.   "I'm just tired by the end of the day..."  "I just forget..."  etc.  All to which I reply, "I'm tired too, but it has to be done."   Divorce isn't an option.  Especially over something as trivial as a clean house.   My booms then launchers get taken out... but I'll try.  Switch the booms with the inner machine guns, or the one-row-up ones?   I've mentioned how I can't relax in a dirty house.  Again, no comment.  Yeah--we need to talk... won't be pretty.   She is #5 of 6, and they grew up with a woman who cleaned and started supper before she left.  I was raised to clean my own crap. I was doing my own laundry by 7 or 8. More was expected of us, I suppose.   http://wall4all.me/thumbs/games/bro-fist-1109995-480x320.png   I guess what I meant is that cleaning is part of being a parent to me.  But I got what ya mean.   I miss Bozo...   Holy shit--that was amazing.  HAHA!   Some nights when no one feels like cooking, we'll have F.F.Y. (fend for yourself) nights.  Except the kids, we give them cereal or something really easy.   We tried that too.  She made fish sticks and mac and cheese every week for her meal because "that's all I know how to make".  We tried telling her to look for recipes and try new ones... that's what adults do.  No go.   Oh, please, it's not as if Netflix customers ASKED for them to make their own shows.  They did it strictly for revenue.   Except for Apocalypse.   So hard to have that conversation without being accusatory.   Upgrading armory is so damn expensive... as is upgrading troops and whatnot.   By the time she gets home, feeds the kids, bathes the kids, and gets them in bed, she "doesn't feel like doing anything".  I, on the other hand, when in the same place will include cleaning up my crap before I veg out and watch television.  She has friends.  She definitely has a supportive husband.  She might be depressed due to me not being around a lot.  Work has gotten crazy lately.   How do I have such a conversation without coming across as if I'm saying, "You're lazy, and you're teaching the kids lazy behavior by being that way"?   We both work to pay for private school tuitions (public schools suck here).  The teenager doesn't give a crap about money surprisingly.  If she doesn't have it, she has an "oh, well" attitude about it.  Totally annoying.   $300/month for food is low unless you love eating ramen or beans and rice.  Typically, housing should be 25% of your budget.  Right now, your rent estimate is 34%.  It's manageable if you make a budget per month and stick with it.  Okay, not sure where you are (and what the standard cost of living is), but in Baton Rouge, LA (where I live) your situation is totally doable.   Yes.  I've even said, "Y'all have GOT to help me clean.  I'm not doing it all by myself."  That gets them to help some.  But I end up doing 60-70% of it on my own... and I'm one of five people in the house.   I make passive-aggressive/guilt-trip statements like, "Man, y'all are messy," "Hey, it'd be awesome if you cleaned," etc.  I even asked my wife this evening (after taking kids home to the dirty house and going back to work for the second part of my day) what she did all day.  "I dunno--hung out.  Why?"  I replied, "I dunno... just thought you'd clean up some or something..."  I got no reply.   My problem is that I'm not the one home to get them to clean up after themselves.  I can get them to clean on the weekends SOME, but if my wife would step up and help, it'd be awesome.      My wife of 5.5 years and I have a 15yo (step-daughter), 4yo son, and 3yo daughter. I work long hours on weekdays: in by 7:30AM, home by 9:00PM or later. I come home, and there is crap everywhere. It builds and builds until the weekend comes.  I can't relax in a messy house. Dishes (sometimes still with food) in sink, trash all over counters, toys everywhere, etc. I end up cleaning on the weekends because I can't stand it. I make the kids clean their crap (whining about how much it is), ask my wife to help (as she's playing Candy-effing-Crush or Face-effing-book) clean.  Why can't they just clean up their own crap? I spend time cleaning up a house that had literally NO messes made by me. I tried the don't-do-anything-until-they-do-it-themselves trick. That backfired miserably. I had TWO weeks of crap to do.  Case in point: my wife stayed home today with the 15yo who is recovering from a tonsillectomy. I brought the 3yo and 4yo to a sitter. I had hoped she would've cleaned the house, done laundry, done frickin' SOMEthing. NOPE. It eas even MORE messy than when I left this morning. What the hell can I do?  tl;dr - Wife and kids are lazy as hell; they won't clean up; husband/dad does everything after working 14+ work days all week.   Either trust her, and let it all go; or don't trust her, and let HER go.   So... what are you asking?   You probably won't.  Do yourself a favor, and block her.   Questions:  1. How old are you and your SO? 2. How long have you been dating? 3. What type of job do you both have?  Is it stable? 4. Are you taking into account the utility deposits (i.e., electricity, water, cable, internet, etc.)?   My wife of 5.5 years and I have a 15yo (step-daughter), 4yo son, and 3yo daughter.

I make the kids clean their crap (whining about how much it is), ask my wife to help (as she's playing Candy-effing-Crush or Face-effing-book) clean.  Why can't they just clean up their own crap? I spend time cleaning up a house that had literally NO messes made by me. I tried the don't-do-anything-until-they-do-it-themselves trick. That backfired miserably. I had TWO weeks of crap to do.  Case in point: my wife stayed home today with the 15yo who is recovering from a tonsillectomy. I brought the 3yo and 4yo to a sitter. I had hoped she would've cleaned the house, done laundry, done frickin' SOMEthing. NOPE. It eas even MORE messy than when I left this morning. What the hell can I do?  tl;dr - Wife and kids are lazy as hell; they won't clean up; husband/dad does everything after working 14+ work days all week.

 A master politician --- pat people on the head, make them feel good but say nothing.                   He is, in fact, leading a national-socialist movement, which is a queasy and uncomfortable thing to write about a man who is the son of Jewish immigrants from Poland and whose family was murdered in the Holocaust.   Kevin Williamson is aghast, aghast, I tell you, that we somehow misinterpreted "National Socialist" as "Nazi".     but is their movement and tactics beyond any criticism  Certainly not - it's a question of how one goes about reaching people.  Our goal is to get Bernie elected.  They may have an obligation to be more thoughtful and listen better and be more patient, as you say --- but, in the end, who has what obligation is less important than building bridges and getting allies.    And, honestly, those of use who aren't black can't really understand o their experience.  What I do know is that being black in America is traumatic, and even if we didn't have the larger more important goal of getting the right person elected, we still ought to cut them some slack.    **TL;DR Let's focus on building allies, not who is in the right or wrong**    WaPo's original title.  They've corrected it.         Nothing could more perfectly demonstrate why Turing tests are meaningless.   Getting frustrated and becoming defensive isn't going to help Bernie get elected.  That is our common goal.  We need to understand where they're coming from --- reach out, embrace them --- admit the candidate's mistakes *and then* point out the good work he's done.    Just dismissing BLM and calling the protestors childish (which I've seen several people here do) is a sure path to losing this crucial demographic - which is incredibly stupid because we are on the same side.    I'm not black, but if I experienced a fraction of what black friends do in their daily lives, I'd be perpetually enraged.  A bit of understanding and humility goes a long way to creating allies.  That is what it's all about.  Let's stop complaining about our frustrations with others who share the same cause ---  and start reaching out instead.   Yeh, I agree.  I deleted it.   I.e., look at race and age rather than the candidate and the issues.  A sad state.       David Axelrod, the Obama campaign strategist who was a senior White House adviser during the crisis years, said Sanders-style criticism ignores the reality of the economic crash. There was a constant tug and pull between the need to discipline an industry whose excesses had triggered the crisis and keeping the system from collapsing, which would have exacerbated an already reeling economy, he said. Senators dont face such conundrums. Presidents do.  Too Big to Fail is an even bigger problem than before the bailout.  All David Axelrod is proving is why he and the rest of Washington need to be swept out.   Congress is less popular than *cockroaches* for God's sake. On the other hand, in poll after poll the American people agree with Bernie on the issues: http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/wp/2015/06/12/bernie-sanders-says-americans-back-his-agenda-and-hes-mostly-right/    On the other hand, the "failure", or what I'd prefer to describe as where Obama fell short, was with financial regulations and campaign finance  Let's put it this way - he was a failure from the perspective of those who elected him, but a success from the perspective of those who funded him.   Are the same people who supported Ron Paul now supporting Bernie Sanders?  Some are, but because of how diametrically opposed their ideologies are, that can't account for it.    So why are people who are attracted to reddit also attracted to these political figures.  I suspect the reason is that they are both anti-establishment, and reddit caters to people who are frustrated with the story presented by the mainstream media, which relentlessly supports establishment figures.            Low even by National Review standards.                     It's an opportunity for discussion that can make this campaign even stronger.   True.  But acknowledging mistakes helps you get it right next time.  And it's also worthwhile for his supporters to have this discussion.   I didn't see the Dallas rally.   Dude, seriously - I respond to you and you just downvote me?    he needs to seize the opportunity to connect with them.   But he has   He most emphatically *has not*.     http://www.usnews.com/news/blogs/ken-walshs-washington/2015/06/30/bernie-sanders-needs-to-make-inroads-with-african-americans  http://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/25/us/politics/bernie-sanders-lags-hillary-clinton-in-introducing-himself-to-black-voters.html  Complacency and disrespect for that community amongst Bernie supporters will cost him the nomination.     I mean dismissing the protest as just "a group of juvenile and rude bunch".    Why is the issue closed?  If this affects whether Bernie can win, I think it's foolish to ignore it.     You should read Chris Savage's post:   Sitting in the middle of this maelstrom was a fascinating experience. I, like many of the others there, was initially irritated by the protestors. I was there to hear the candidates and was frustrated that they werent being heard. Even a bit angry, in fact. These are your allies, I thought. Why on earth are you attacking them? Why are you disrupting an event where the people there are sympathetic to your cause?   Frustration. Anger. Being silenced.   Frustration.   Anger.   Silenced.   Talked over.   Ignored.   Every single one of these emotions that ran through my white privileged brain in the first few moments of the protest until I was slapped across the face with what I was being forced to confront. Every single one of these emotions are felt acutely and painfully every single day by racial minority groups in our country. **But, instead of being inconvenienced by not being able to hear a politician speak, they face them in the context of being slaughtered in the streets by the police officers who are tasked to protect them, incarcerated in astonishingly disparate numbers, and blamed for not being able to escape from the prison of poverty that holds far too many of them in bondage.**  Which is covered in CrooksAndLiars:  http://crooksandliars.com/2015/07/about-netroots-nations-town-hall   If a candidate can't acknowledge his/her weaknesses and change them, you have a weak candidate who will grow weaker over time. (Yes, he incorporated some extra language in his stump speech, and that's good. But he still didn't listen at that time.)   Whatever I may think of Martin O'Malley (and my personal jury is out on him), his response was certainly better than crossing his arms and leaving angry. He screwed up, acknowledged he screwed up, and then engaged.   As for Sanders, he had an opportunity and completely missed it. That doesn't make him a bad person or a bad candidate or a bigot or anything else. It makes him a candidate who missed a golden opportunity to close the gap with people who aren't connecting with him or his message, regardless of whether he has been an advocate for the meta-issues which affect them.    If Bernie and his supporters only have that attitude about this issue, he is going to lose.  I don't want to see that happen.   Not saying they do - quite the opposite.  Bernie needs to connect with African American voters, and this *is* a burning issue for them.  IMO, he needs to seize the opportunity to connect with them.      Agree about those protesters, but this was a moment for him to raise his profile with the  black community beyond these protesters.  He does need to get their support if he hopes to win.   Bernie's speech and the interruption is here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHhrvKlZyS4  When Bernie turns to address the issue, he immediately launches into economic issues.  This is *part* of the story, but it doesn't represent the burning pain that the African American community experiences.  Economics is too abstract. He was definitely off key from my perspective (and you can see from my posting history that I'm a huge supporter).    What Bernie should have said is: "BlackLivesMatter is about the dehumanization of an entire community.  It's a continuation of a racist legacy in this country and we need to recognize that.  We need to recognize it, we need to admit it, we need to apologize for what was done to African Americans and we need to stop it."  He should then talk about why the Civil Rights movement mattered (and delicately mention his role and that he was arrested), and that we need to continue that same struggle for civil rights.    Bernie needs to put that out there, and connect on a visceral level like he does on the issues in the rest of his problem, before he goes on to addressing his technical solutions.  His technical solutions are pretty good responses, but he needs to position them as addressing the issue of dehumanization.  1. We can reduce Police brutality by introducing community policing 2. An essential component of human dignity is being able to make a living, and that is why we should make a commitment to addressing chronic under employment in minority communities     Totally different situation.  Ron Paul took positions against the Republican base (on military intervention, the drug war and surveillance).  Listen to him being booed at Republican primary debates:  * [In North Carolina](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7v8qtZ3I5AM )  * [In Tampa](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWnFKB9yL08 )  It's the exact opposite for Bernie.  His challenge is to get the message out.    I should do it [like this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoethxOp5Kg )?   I had to upvote him for the sheer balls-out crazy of it all.   Awful.  Sounds like David Axelrod got to that guy.  "Remember to mention how she's relatable because she speaks about her grandkids.  Everyone can relate to that.  Don't forget to mention that you have grandkids too.  Because everyone can relate to that."  Tripe.   Thanks.  Strange - I didn't really see anything wrong with what my opponent said either in terms of civility.      I'm not sure what is inappropriate in the above comment.    So now we're talking about a different issue than the conflict of interest. Unless your point is that this was a bullshit excuse meant to cover the fact that Holder was unwilling to prosecute former clients.  Yes, this is my main point.   Frankly, I think those are legitimate concerns.   Ok. That  is the first time you've said that.  IMO, you're part of the problem if you think those are not legitimate concerns.  You gave that impression until now.   Getting justice against the evil bankers who destroyed our economy, or however you'd like to cast it,   So I see you're back to sneering at me.  The fact that you seem unconcerned, and a trifle amused by the demand for justice does make me suspicious again.  Crimes which go unpunished are repeated.  But, if you're on the side of the industry or the DOJ, I suppose it's much easier to just characterize critics as wanting some kind of absurd hippie justice.   would be cold comfort for the people who would suffer if, say, Goldman Sachs was overburdened (let alone forced out of business) by fines and criminal liability.   Well now, that does sound suspiciously close to Lanny Breuer's reasoning, the Too Big To Prosecute policy.  Should Enron have stayed in business? How about Arthur Anderson?  But I guess you've already said you think it's a concern, so I'll let it go.   For one thing, setting aside for a moment whether I've watched the video, I think it's appropriate to say you are being unfair, to use your word, to tune me out, seeing as I think I've demonstrated I'm not an idiot  Idiocy wasn't the issue.   Lanny Breuer is probably a smart guy, but he's clearly part of the problem.  (Would you agree?)  I was tuning you out because you gave all indications (until now) that you supported his policies.    But if you think your comments clearly prove that Holder's DOJ failed, perhaps in bad faith, to prosecute a bunch of individuals that it had a case against, I have no idea where you're getting that.  No, I think they failed in their duties to investigate so that prosecutions were possible.  They soft-gloved these companies.  That by itself is *the* problem.  That  Covington had numerous cases before DOJ during Holder's tenure and was keeping his seat warm creates a picture of impropriety.  Obviously, I'm not claiming to *prove* Holder's motive, but his associations combined with the clear dereliction of duty at his DOJ creates a picture of regulatory capture, and that erodes trust in government.     Flawed analysis.  It could be that Obama won because of a swing back from the far right politics of the past 40 years.  The author doesn't account for the fact that Dean and Bradley together never drew the crowds that Sanders is.  And he certainly doesn't account for how a Socialist drew the biggest crowd of any of the contenders in the Red State of Arizona.   You can find people to bet with here:  https://www.predictit.org/Home/SingleOption?contractId=723  http://www.predictwise.com/politics/2016demnomination   Do you have evidence that Sanders is doing it?     and I hope I've made my point that if you treat "Wall Street defense firms" as toxic,  Well, I conceded earlier that isn't really the heart of the issue.  The problem is that Holder's staff *refused to investigate*  and refused to prosecute based  on criteria like "how it would hurt innocent employees and shareholders".  (That is almost a direct quote, if you'd read what I wrote in my comment).  Luckily, you get to dismiss me as "part of the problem" and tune out anything I might possibly say, because obviously I'm just a shill who couldn't possibly contribute anything of value  Don't whine at me that I'm being unfair when you're too lazy not just to watch the video, but even to read the short blog post I referenced that gives a precis of the video, or even, obviously to lazy to read the text in my actual comment.  There's more than enough in there to make my point.     If you're reflexively defending the revolving door, and refusing to even consider what someone is trying to show you, then yes, you are part of the problem.    Exactly.  And that is why nobody listens to progressives.  They'll just go and dutifully vote for whatever corporatist the party runs.  They'll say their "holding their nose", as if that matters.  Ultimately, that's why the Democratic party elites despise their base instead of fearing them.  They are such a pusillanimous bunch.   Ron Paul's core positions -- anti-militarism, anti-drug war, anti-surveillance -- were popular on reddit, but hated by actual Republicans.  Sanders' progressive positions are popular with the actual Democratic base.  In fact, majorities of Americans support him when polled on the issues.  http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/wp/2015/06/12/bernie-sanders-says-americans-back-his-agenda-and-hes-mostly-right/   I think there's something wrong with you.  I'm done.    Matt Taibbi is a joke... He also has no standard of evidence -   Good "argument".  Are you a joke too?  You've presented no evidence at all.  Failure of oversight is something that's very hard to put someone in jail for because you have no affirmative acts. You certainly can't blame the top executives who don't actually monitor individual transactions.   http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2015-02-16/hsbc-bank-secret-origins-laundering-worlds-drug-money   Why did HSBC not terminate its links with the Al Rajhi in 2005? The answer lies in what was then put in place in Afghanistan to generate large amounts of cash. When it comes to opium/ heroin and offshore banks, Britain rules supreme. In 2005, poppy fields in southern Afghanistan began to bloom, and it became evident to the bankers and the geo-politicians of Britain and the US that cash to support the financial centers and the terrorists could be made right there.  http://www.forbes.com/sites/afontevecchia/2012/07/16/hsbc-helped-terrorists-iran-mexican-drug-cartels-launder-money-senate-report-says/   HSBC actively circumvented rules designed to block transactions involving terrorists, drug lords, and rogue regimes.  In one case, two HSBC affiliates sent nearly 25,000 transactions involving $19.4 billion through their HBUS [HSBCs U.S. affiliate] accounts over seven years without disclosing the transactions links to Iran.  I get it that you're a big fan of banking sector criminals.  The question is why.  Are you an Obama zealot?  Someone who works in banking?  Or are you just a troll?   You're arguing for rationality, and let's assume for a minute that regional origin doesn't matter to someone's performance in the role, but that it does matter for elections.  Are you arguing that a politician shouldn't care that a poorly chosen running mate will reduce the chance winning the election?  That seems an absurd and self-defeating attitude.  Logic tends to eliminate candidates who think like that.  Second, it's not clear that regional origin isn't important to the role.  Politicians are connected through networks, and those networks, as for all of us, are likely to be regional.  The fact is that the regional advantage in elections is probably reflective of regional connections and regional connections are important to regional concerns  being considered.  That is "political" thinking.   Sounds like you are saying it's a difference in post-processing, not tetrachromacy versus trichromacy?         Are you serious?  http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/05/16/foreclosure-fraud-audit-false-claims-act_n_862686.html   The five separate investigations were conducted by the Department of Housing and Urban Developments inspector general and examined Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo, Citigroup and Ally Financial, the sources said.   The audits accuse the five major lenders of violating the False Claims Act, a Civil War-era law crafted as a weapon against firms that swindle the government. The audits were completed between February and March, the sources said. The internal watchdog office at HUD referred its findings to the Department of Justice, which must now decide whether to file charges.  https://www.sec.gov/news/press/2010/2010-59.htm   The SEC alleges that Goldman Sachs structured and marketed a synthetic collateralized debt obligation (CDO) that hinged on the performance of subprime residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS). Goldman Sachs failed to disclose to investors vital information about the CDO, in particular the role that a major hedge fund played in the portfolio selection process and the fact that the hedge fund had taken a short position against the CDO.  Just the tip of the iceberg.      The author was a [White House Counselor] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counselor_to_the_President ) to Bill Clinton.       You walk into an arena and find 10,000 people looking at you . . .  he said in an interview, trailing off. Then he turned to Michael Briggs, his charmingly beleaguered press aide.   How many RSVPs do we have now in Phoenix? he asked. 10,000?   **The swell forced the campaign to move the event twice. The same thing happened in Portland, Maine, where he ended up speaking to more than 7,500. And in Madison, Wis., where he spoke to a crowd about 10,000. And in Denver, where he spoke to about 5,000.**      [If online tests for tetrachromacy are nonsense](http://www.snopes.com/politics/medical/tetrachromacy.asp ) why do I see something distinctly different from everyone else?

It's time to write to the public editor.  public@nytimes.com  Bernie just drew another record crowd in Phoenix, AZ, again the largest of any Presidential candidate.  Why is the NYTimes politics section ignoring  these   events while covering Hillary Clinton at more than twice the rate?   Nothing in your quote answers my question.  Why should I answer your question?  The DOJ should figure this out.  They should do their job. But they didn't.  Here's an example.   http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/outrageous-hsbc-settlement-proves-the-drug-war-is-a-joke-20121213   I don't know why I paste this here.  You won't read it, will you?  Seriously, I think all you've convinced me of is that you are part of the problem.  What is your line of work?  Do you work for the banks, are you a conservative or are you just a die hard Obama fan?   Didn't  you ask me this already?   Elizabeth Warren worked at Cadwalader, one of wall streets' go to law firms. What does that prove?  https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/3dqkxu/elizabeth_warren_sends_hillary_clinton_a_message/ct84upf     I'm curious, although it doesn't matter much to my stance, did he literally have an empty office with his name on it left vacant for years? That'd be kind of funny.    [He did](http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/eric-holder-wall-street-double-agent-comes-in-from-the-cold-20150708 ).    If you don't want to hire people from a firm that could be called a "Wall Street defense firm"  There are lots of top firms that wouldn't be considered top Wall Street defense firms - WSGR, Fenwick, Orrick, etc.  They do financing with these companies, but they certainly are not packed with lawyers who defend them from prosecution.   I think some oversight is required   I agree, I just think it occurred.  I don't see how you can look at the evidence in that Frontline piece and come out with the opinion you have.  Honestly, you've only convinced me that you're part of the problem.       I linked you to a video, a blog post summarizing the video, extracted the key bit of that blog post,  copied a statement from a DOJ attorney who explains their too big to prosecute policy... but your response is  "you link me to a 53 minute video".    It's the job of the DOJ to figure out who to prosecute, not me - and they shirked that duty.  Your dishonest apologetics don't change that.     I answered a very similar comment here: https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/3dqkxu/elizabeth_warren_sends_hillary_clinton_a_message/ct7wqt0   I don't disagree with you.  I think Obama got the policies he wanted.   It suggests we should be suspicious of her if she tries to help Wall Street evade accountability for crimes, like Holder did.         Trump shows McCain what it's like to be on the receiving end of Republican "logic".   Off year elections always favor the opposition party.  So, not sure what left wing saviors have to do with anything.   ... republicans win  Uh, yeh, I discussed that in my original comment      Suggesting that liberals hold their breath until they get a perfect candidate is exactly what cost the Democrats the House in '10 and the Senate in '14.  Huh?  Off year elections teach us what exactly?    This makes no sense.   Nixon won by the narrowest of margins and Humphrey was a supporter of Johnson's incredibly unpopular policy on Vietnam, so ... meh.  Reagan got elected on the back of stagflation caused by Nixon and cured by Carter.    Yup, the reaction to Reagan winning was to elect Bill Clinton. Progressives abandoned populism and  got lost in a morass of identity politics that only mattered to children at coastal universities.  And yes, we got Bill Clinton, who is now apologizing for saddling us with NAFTA, giving us Wall Street deregulation, disastrous drug policies, trade policies that drove up drug prices, and giving us mass incarceration which has made us the world's top jailor.  Democrats were wildly popular when they championed progressive populist economic policies.      As for failure to prosecute bankers, there have been plenty of investigations and settlements related to the wrongdoing surrounding the financial crisis.  But if you wanted individuals prosecute, I'd be happy for you to point out to me exactly which people violated which statutes in which ways at which times.  Sounds like your mind is made up, but if you want to learn something, checkout Frontline's coverage of this topic: http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/untouchables/  [This blog](http://firedoglake.com/2013/01/23/frontline-exposes-dojs-failure-to-prosecute-wall-street/ ) has a good write up that talks about how Frontline reporters were easily able to find witnesses to the crimes that Holder's attorney Lanny Breuer claimed did not exist.  Breuer is the guy who articulated the DOJ's [Too Big to Prosecute Policy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gbcB5BRzXo feature=youtu.be t=19m30s ):   We are frequently on the receiving end of presentations from defense counsel, CEOs and economists who argue that the collateral consequences of an indictment would be devastating, just devasting for their client.  In my conference room over these past years, I've heard sober predictions that a company or bank might fail if we indict.  That innocent employees could lose their jobs.  That entire industries could be affected and that even global markets will feel the effects.  ... In reaching every chargin decisions we must take into account the effect of an indictment on innocent employees and shareholders..."  If you don't think there's something wrong with that,  sorry, but you are part of the problem.     The revolving door is a reality. It's really, really hard to change that.  That's an absurd, defeatist position.  That's like saying "the floor gets dirty, so why clean it?"    The fact is, that things have gotten *much worse* over the past 40 years.  http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/28/books/review/this-town-by-mark-leibovich.html:   in 1974, 3 percent of retiring members of Congress became lobbyists. Now 50 percent of senators and 42 percent of congressmen do. No one goes home anymore.   You make a good case for someone you want to have Holder's resume.  However, you're also ignoring the fact that this guy *did not prosecute people who were his former and future potential clients* while he was AG.  He did not prosecute them for what is agreed to be some of the greatest financial frauds the country has ever seen .  And this went on *for years* with Obama doing nothing about it.  When you have someone with an obvious conflict of interest --- like Holder with his empty corner office at one of Wall Street's favorite defense firms --- I think some oversight is required, or do you disagree with this?  Do you disagree that such a nominee ought to be carefully selected so that they are not in fact a crony of the system they have need to oversee?    He got the outcome he want, and employed effective processes to get it. If he'd wanted something different, he might have used different management tactics to get that. The failure was not of management but of values and process.  I completely agree with this.   All questions of trust rely not just on saying we should trust but what should we trust  Or who we should trust.  I think that was what OP was arguing, and which I was agreeing with.  /u/TheRealRockNRolla was arguing that OP was unfairly criticizing Obama because what he's doing is "just basic management".   I love that you assume that insiders refusing to  prosecute their buddies for some of the biggest cases of fraud the world has ever seen is completely ok.   Get past the headline and listen to the actual interview.   Interviewer: "[Your supporters] are afraid that Clinton won't give voice to issues that you care about"  ... Warren talks at length about student loan issues.   Interviewer: "Is Hillary Clinton the right messenger? Could she give a credible voice to give the middle class a fair shake?"   I think we need to give her a chance to decide if shes going to run and to lay out what she wants to run on, Warren said. **I think thats her opportunity to do that.**   Warren: "Everyone needs to be talking about, in every race and in every county how we need to be creating a future for the middle class."  That's hardly an endorsement.  She's signaling that Hillary needs to support progressive causes.  Warren is holding a stick to get Hillary to move the debate to the left.  That's smart politics.    If she just got out and declared against Hillary, she'd just be cast as an opponent and the story would be "Democrats fighting with each other again".  Staying on the sidelines means candidates need to court her.  She shapes the whole conversation.  She can endorse at a later time (the pressure will build for her to do so).  If she times that endorsement correctly, she'll be able to push her preferred nominee to victory.  If she endorses Sanders for example too early, she loses the power of her independent voice.  Endorse now, and everything she says from now on will be considered just another mouthpiece of the Sanders campaign.  As it is, she keeps people guessing, and provides an independent force that drives the conversation to the left.   In the short term, a GOP win is terrible.  In the long term, a Wall Street Democrat win is more terrible because it strengthens their position.  If Hillary runs and loses -- because the base is disgusted and refuses to support her -- it strengthens the hand of progressives on the next election cycle.  Progressives are such weak kneed cowards who agree to support the leader no matter what --- as a result, Democratic leaders know they can ignore them.   Republican leaders are scared of their base, and tilt ever further rightward.   I haven't gotten the sense she's been rooting for Hillary at all.  She's maintaining distance.  I am disappointed she didn't run.     Unlikely .  Adding another New England liberal to the ticket isn't going to help, and Warren is going to be wasted in the VP slot.    You delegate to someone you trust to do the job.   Eric Holder came from one of Wall Street's favorite defense firms.  They actually kept his office empty while he was Attorney General.  Not one Wall Street banker prosecuted under his watch.  He returned recently to his multi-million dollar job.  Should Obama have trusted him?  Does that count as "basic management"?     This is such a clickbait title.     I was referring to Rand Paul.   Another increasingly obvious danger of our current tax code is the empowerment of a rogue agency, the IRS, to examine the most private financial and lifestyle information of every American citizen. We now know that the IRS, through political hacks like former IRS official Lois Lerner, routinely abused its auditing power to build an enemies list and harass anyone who might be adversarial to President Obamas policies. A convoluted tax code enables these corrupt tactics.  What a loon.   They don't vote for them "because they're anti-establishment".  They want to hear someone who will explain what's wrong with the system - and who has a plan to fix it.  Both Paul and Sanders aren't shy to critique fundamental problems in our system.  The same people find that refreshing, and trust them.  Even though I'm opposed to Rand Paul and I'm a fan of Sanders, I don't see anything absurd about that.   If Hillsry loses because progressives refuse to support her, it'll mean that Democrats will have to cater to the left wing to stand a chance in the next election.  Republicans fear their base because they won't be pushed around.   Democrats despise their base because they are such pathetic spineless weaklings who will always support their party leader.   This is the reason our politics has gone so far right.   They're both anti-Establishment candidates.  People know something is deeply wrong and resonate with people who give an explanation and propose radical (in the original sense of getting to the root) changes.   Read the flat tax proposal on his site. He sounds like a raving lunatic.   I honestly don't see a huge difference between her and Mitt Romney.  She's saying a lot of stuff to placate the left right now, but from a policy perspective, how different is she? Happy to be convinced that I'm wrong.   That's what they're counting on.  The problem with the reliable partisan voter is that the party insiders know they can ignore your opinion since they'll still get your vote.   You sound like me most of the time.     I would like a break from past administrations, he's still a very polarizing figure (I live in a very conservative state, bring up his name and watch the fireworks display)  I guess I still have a soft spot for him because of his technocratic insights --- global warming and funding the research that gave us the internet.  Those are pretty huge resume points.  Obama and Clinton have no insights.  They are merely politicians.  That said, I totally hear you --- Democrats that don't speak the language of populism are missing the boat, and sadly, Al Gore's personality just doesn't work for a lot of people.    I'd be happiest with a complete break from the current party infrastructure.  My second choice would be Gore, though.  I don't view Hillary as a legitimate choice at all.   How is zero?  Is zero ok for you guys?    I don't agree with their assessment that Sanders is a regional candidate.   Me neither.   I'm a big Bernie fan, but also like Gore.  He's a damn sight better than Hillary.  What are your objections to him?     Matt Stoler is misreading what the authors say.   There's a good refutation of his piece [here](http://neweconomicperspectives.org/2014/04/oligarchy-yet.html ).     And the darkest secret of the ultra-liberal world is that the most palatable alternative to a nominee such as Bernie Sanders or Elizabeth Warren would also be Clinton.   Thank you, that was truly Idiotic.    Or 15% of the voting public have dropped out of the process because they just don't give a shit about politics.  They don't give a shit because they know what political scientists have proven: [the US is an oligarchy](http://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-echochambers-27074746 ).   Voting for a candidate funded by Wall Street gives you a candidate who serves the interests of Wall Street.     Because those of us who really need our politicians to guard the line effectively know that politics is too important to fuck around with fantasyland.  That is exactly the thinking that those who fund both parties are counting on.  The fantasy is that a corporate candidate is going to do something other than serve those corporate interests.    http://www.politico.com/story/2014/04/wall-street-republicans-hillary-clinton-2016-106070.html:   The darkest secret in the big money world of the Republican coastal elite is that **the most palatable alternative to a nominee such as Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas or Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky would be Clinton**, a familiar face on Wall Street following her tenure as a New York senator with relatively moderate views on taxation and financial regulation.   **If it turns out to be Jeb versus Hillary we would love that and either outcome would be fine,** one top Republican-leaning Wall Street lawyer said over lunch in midtown Manhattan last week. We could live with either one. Jeb versus Joe Biden would also be fine. Its Rand Paul or Ted Cruz versus someone like Elizabeth Warren that would be everybodys worst nightmare.       Enthusiasm is an impossible thing to measure beyond anecdotal evidence  Disagree.   Social media metrics - likes, shares, followers - are well recognized measures of enthusiasm.  My company works with Fortune 500 brands, and I can tell you they are *all* concerned with these metrics.  They would drool to have a tiny sliver of what Sanders gets for free.  I've looked at the numbers, and he's killing on this front.    Ultimately, however, the amount of votes that will be reached and turned by that base is just not big enough to warrant a discussion in a primary like this  You seem certain, but supply no evidence to support that claim.  How would you quantitate that?  How big is that audience?  Why did Sanders rise from 2% to 15% in a couple of months, and with no funding?   Did your thinking account for that?  Why should I think that your current feelings have any more predictive power?   Social Advertising may happen, but that risks over-enthusiasm (See many in Tea Party) and a resultant content exhaustion from other consumers.  This is just opinion masquerading as fact. One could easily say "advertising on traditional media risks over exhaustion and mistrust of consumers, who increasingly see paid media as untrustworthy.  Hillary's billions may backfire on her".  See?  Anyone can spout opinions.      but the issue is that most of these people aren't going to have the experience or training at the level of the Field Organizers that Hillary will have, which is where her fundamental advantages lies.   Agree - I think that's a big challenge for his campaign.  I just came across this  New Republic article asking the same question.  Someone  who's involved with the campaign says that there's a big launch planned for end of July.  It will be interesting to see how they manage: https://np.reddit.com/r/SandersForPresident/comments/3d9iqo/bernie_sanderss_grassroots_army_is_passionate_but/ct341xe   There's already over a thousand events across the country scheduled, with more added daily. These volunteer coordinators will CC the regional coordinators on things. In a way, there is a top-down oversight they're working on, but it still depends heavily on volunteers.   Sounds like lots of stuff happening, but "in a way/depends heavily on volunteers" suggests there's not much coordination (yet).    Crowds don't really mean anything in a Presidential election.  Crowds are an indicator of enthusiasm, and you later say that enthusiasm is important, so you seem to be contradicting yourself.   People who go to a rally aren't going to do anything but vote for the candidate,   For starters, they talk about the candidate on social media.  Social media is free and as advertising it's more effective.  To quantitate this, consider that even *paid* influencer advertising is estimated to be [4-10x more likely to cause a conversion than traditional media](http://branderati.com/the-age-of-advocacy-and-influence-26-stats-marketers-should-know/ ).  Sanders is winning social media hands down over *every* other candidate.  See [this piece in NYT](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/19/us/politics/bernie-sanders-wants-to-be-president-but-hes-already-facebook-royalty.html ).    So Sanders is the hands down winner at the most effective form of advertising which also happens to be completely free.      Hillary's phone-banking, GOTV, and door-knocking will be an organized and efficient machine that Sanders cannot hope to touch, realistically.  Being able to pay workers is helpful. But what do you make of the 175K (as of May 4th) Sanders volunteers?  Obviously, not all will activate, but it goes to the point that enthusiasm means Sanders can do much more with much less.  It's not clear that Sanders won't be organized --- he's getting top talent joining his campaign.  Organizers like the head of the Communication Workers Union just recently joined for example.  But agree, he doesn't have the well oiled machine that Clinton has and her advantages in the mainstream media are matched by his deficits there.  Ad to this that Clinton and her supporters in key positions in the Democratic Party (e.g., Wasserman Schultz) are doing their best to tip the scales in her favor, and we can see that Sanders has his work cut out for him.  Still, it's far from a certainty where it will go.  The new media landscape and massive voter frustration are new variables.   This looks like viral marketing, and I was extremely skeptical, but the Amazon reviews seem to back this up.  Can an opthamologist explain how this works?  It seems strange that someone who is missing one type of cone can see new colors because of a lens.    Bernie Sanders most definitely knows that he will not  Is there any useful information in that statement?  Prediction markets currently give him 11%.    The country is split basically 50/50 politically and the battle is for the increasingly small middle.   "The battle for the middle"  is a Sunday talk show trope, which like many things they say, is not backed by actual evidence.  Elections are more likely won or lost based on the enthusiasm gap.  Here's [an analysis from Nate Silver](http://fivethirtyeight.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/11/04/enthusiasm-gap-was-largest-in-presidential-swing-states/ ) which pretty convincingly demonstrates this.  I.e., Battle for the Middle is nonsense.  Voter enthusiasm is key.    (Who has been drawing the largest crowds of any Presidential candidate?)    If you are the kind of person who would vote for Bernie Sanders, you are not the kind of person who is going to vote for Bush, Paul, or Rubio.   Not clear - Bernie  appeals to voters who are frustrated by bad government.  Republicans win low information voters with a populist message about big government elitists.  Corporate Democrats play right into that messaging.  Sanders' thesis is that there are a lot of people frustrated with government who would be open to a populist message from the left.  That hasn't happened in over 50 years, but the last time it did, Democrats won huge majorities and were competitive in all 50 states.     What are you basing that on?    General election voter participation rate has been trending downwards since the 80s.  In 88 it was above 75%, now it is just breaking 60%.  At the same time we have the Congressional approval rating in history.    So 15% of the voting public have dropped out of the process because they don't believe their elected officials actually represent them (an idea [verified] (http://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-echochambers-27074746 )  by political scientists).  That's a huge number of new voters that  might be reached by the right campaign.     I literally face palmed when I saw Abrams cast Cumberbatch as Khan.  As [this post](http://bitchmagazine.org/post/the-race-of-khan-in-the-new-star-trek-into-darkness-movie-0 ) puts it, continuing "a tradition where complicated, sympathetic villains are white guys, whereas garden variety angry bad-guys are more likely to be people of color."   The Donald, the American flag, the White House, and Nazi SS *re-enactors*.    Pure gold.         Toronto is like the Boston of the North.   Webb seems to be trying out for the position, staking out a position to the far right, defending the Confederate flag and saying that "Youre right, the party has moved way far to the left. Thats not my Democratic Party in and of itself." http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/jim-webb-democratic-party-has-moved-way-far-the-left      It's ridiculous -- water security theater.   Totes    Search for Bernie Sanders' volunteer page.  (/r/politics blocked the comment where I posted a direct link to it).   Bernie Sanders Volunteer page: https://go.berniesanders.com/page/s/volunteer   Restaurants won't serve water unless you ask.    404 not found         I didn't know what to expect.  That absolutely floored me.   Is that a leonberger pup?   The only reason you provide for the data being invalid are the source --- how is that not an ad hominem attack   But he is also unknown amongst man of those voters.  Remember -- he was at 2% when the primaries started.   As voters start to understand what he's about, they will flock to him.      His only arguments are [ad hominem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ad_hominem ) attacks.  Ignore.   Rather than ad hominem attacks, how about some data?  Polls from other sources come to a similar conclusion.  For example, this recent WaPo piece: ["Bernie Sanders says Americans back his agenda  and hes mostly right"](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/wp/2015/06/12/bernie-sanders-says-americans-back-his-agenda-and-hes-mostly-right/ )   A few reasons:  1. Opposition tends to win in off-year elections 2. Obama's lost enthusiasm by tacking right immediately after getting elected 3. Seats in play were primarily Democratic, that year, if I remember correctly 3. Gerrymandering meant that Democrats had to win more votes to get elected   LOL.   Hey guys --- we found one !!!   Prediction markets give Sanders a [10% chance](http://www.predictwise.com/politics/2016demnomination ).   Very common to see that in developing countries.            Sample size required for 5% error and 95% confidence is only 126.  I.e., this study is 44 times higher than that.  The margin of error with a sample size of 5K is .79%.  The confidence level is 99.99999999999% http://www.raosoft.com/samplesize.html   Statists is actually a hugely misleading field.  Uh huh.... what exactly are your qualifications?          Or brain freeze.      TIL the field of statistics is false because a guy on reddit said so.   Uh... [sampling](http://www.surveysystem.com/sscalc.htm )?   ... and angry   The funny thing is that if they actually read what I wrote above it concludes that laws cannot fix the problem.              Wait - why am I getting downvoted for that?   Rand Paul.    My neighbor bought those 9 mm I mentioned earlier, and one night a pickup truck parked across the road and blared music at 2 in the morning. He went out there and opened fire.  Wow.  That sounds like exactly the kind of person they're describing in the study.    That's pretty much the problem. Most of this is not angry people running out, buying a gun, and shooting, nor is it mentally handicapped people, so it can't be stopped.  Yet other countries don't have the problem.  Why?   So given that they don't have a criminal record and that they may just be angry impulsive people *in general*, is there actually any way to keep the guns out of their hands?  I.e., with criminals you can mandate criminal background checks.  If it were people with diagnosable mental disorders, it might be possible to regulate based on mental health history (though, obviously, lots of issues in how to handle that).  If it were people who got angry suddenly and committed acts soon thereafter, you could have a waiting period.    BUT... if it's a population of people who are constantly angry and impulsive, neither criminal background check nor psychiatric check nor waiting period is going to fix the problem.  * * * (On a side note, I think the gun nuts have found this thread, and are downvoting facts, which you are guilty of providing.   Have an upvote from me.)     Oh, right, yeh, I guess it's not a problem at all that angry, impulsive people tend to buy lots of guns.   I think he's referring to this: ["Clinton's campaign sets $2B fundraising target"](http://www.politico.com/story/2015/05/hillary-clinton-fundraising-goal-2-billion-118183.html )      What is the right size sample?         Agree - he seems to be also have the regular Republican voter in mind.  He has talked about the [50 state strategy](http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/sanders-dems-insane-to-ignore-red-states-wants-primary-debates-with-republicans/article/2567646 ) (that Howard Dean initially championed).  I think he has the message to do it.     He actually hits the Republican Party pretty hard.  Have you heard his push back on "Family Values"?  **EDIT**: "Republican" = "Republican Party"      I keep seeing anecdotes - here on Reddit, and in the news (see below) - that otherwise stalwart Republican voters like what they hear from Bernie.  Ideologues are still going to hate him... but it may be that a lot of casual conservatives care more about authenticity.  Bernie gives an unfiltered explanation of why America isn't working for them and a clear plan to change that.   So is there a population of Republicans who'd switch if they heard Bernie's message?  I'd love to see numbers on this.  http://www.thomhartmann.com/users/bluedog-294/blog/2015/06/republicans-bernie-sanders  http://www.dailykos.com/story/2015/06/23/1395700/-Republicans-for-Bernie-Sanders#  Team Sanders seems to understand this already, given the recent ad.     Stellar letters.  It would be good to ask the ombudsman to take a position on the coverage of Sanders.  **EDIT**: I meant Public Editor, not ombudsman.   I keep seeing anecdotes like this.  I'd love to see some numbers on this.  The reason Democrats lost so many people in the middle of the country is that we've run inauthentic Washington liberals. To the extent that Obama has tacked right and failed to be a progressive, his numbers have fallen.  Washington insiders argue that the country is center right, but I think the opposite is true --- on issue after issue, Americans are much further left than our actual politics.  The problem is that neither party gives them what they want.  Democrats give a watered down version that people don't know whether to trust.  While Republicans mislead them with lies that explain why they are held back economically (Big Government! Washington Liberals!)  Regular folks want straight talkers who don't hold back, and who give them explanations of why America isn't working for them, not carefully parsed talking points.  GWB gave them a manufactured authenticity.  Sanders, on the other hand, is genuinely authentic, and I think the public is hungry for it.      Which hasn't got much circulation.      They're way ahead of you. http://www.salon.com/2015/07/07/fox_news_big_bernie_sanders_lie_the_rights_laughably_lame_effort_to_link_donald_trump_and_sanders/               How is this an editorialized title?    The only thing I added was the date to signal that this is in fact an old post.   Mismanagement is mismanagement.  It doesn't matter how you get there.  Bible Belt doesn't have its own currency, so the only way it can survive is by a massive injection of Federal dollars.  Greece can't debase its currency (making its exports cheaper) AND it isn't getting funds from the wealthier parts of the currency union.  Either you have a currency union and there are cash transfers to keep the failures afloat (like here in the US), or you have separate states with separate currencies.      Instead of childishly keep asking for other countries to be the responsible ones, to keep supporting a child that refuses to take responsibility for it's actions and choices.  You mean like we do here in the US, where wealthy liberal states support poor conservative ones?

I should work that out for next launch.    Cool! I have looked at The Apollo67 website. This was just a first go, so we used cell phones. Plans are already under way for an APRS beacon.   No, the camera was outside a styrofoam cooler. The more important parts were inside with a hand warmer. Even still, it got to -10C inside the cooler. Without the insulation, and the fact that chemical handwarmers will not work at altitude (they require oxygen), it wouldn't stand a chance. Though it might have given us a few thousand more feet.  Things to engineer for next time!   Our primary tracking system used a [TK-102 GPS/GSM tracker](http://www.ebay.com/itm/like/161578074970?lpid=82 chn=ps). It works by texting GPS coordinates when pinged. Although, there is no cell reception above 15-20,000 feet, so for most of the flight we were in the dark.  It landed in a soybean field a little east of Stoughton. It was very close to out predicted landing.    On Monday a small student group in the physics department sent up a helium high altitude balloon. This is one photo we recovered. It's a little blurry because the payload is nowhere near stable.  This photo is from about 20,000 feet. The camera continued to collect images until the battery froze at about 33,000 feet. The balloon continued to 95,000 feet (18 miles!) before the balloon burst. Total flight time of about 2.5 hours.      The ice only exists in certain regions, but the atmosphere mixes easily and is remarkably uniform for the size. It takes just about a year for, say, the molecules in a liter of gas in one place today to become evenly distributed around the globe. This has been measured with stable heavy isotopes and various nuclear disasters/explosions.  The ice has a resolution of about one year, since the snow fall that traps the gas pockets happens on a yearly cycle. It is a great and reasonably high resolution way to estimate global CO2 levels for the last 800,000 years (Maximum so far achieved for the EPICA program.) Sea sediments can go back as far as 200 million years with lower resolution than ice cores.  So how is it irrelevant? Facts are relevant to science and this is a fact. CO2 levels are higher now than ever in the last million years. There's good confidence to say that and a mountain of supporting evidence with well defined error bars.

    Not only far, but if they hit an updraft just right, they'll come flying straight up in the air and land on top of you.    Source:  Merchant Mariner, found flying fish on the weather deck of a ship with a 30' freeboard.   Have an upvote, man.  Also, KPS   The birds out in the middle of the ocean are always cool to see, until one flies into the engine room.  We had this large, green/black sea bird fly on board our ship off the coast of China, and, because we didn't want it crapping on, landing on, or damaging the equipment in any way, I spent the good part of a day just trying to shoo the thing out of there.  However, on a 600 ft container ship the engine room was 4 stories tall with a ton of open space, so we ended up saying screw it and let it be.  Not sure whatever happened to that bird, but it wasn't seen again for the remainder of that voyage.  Hopefully it found its way out the same way it came in.     We ran into one of those fields over by Taiwan - probably my favorite moment out at sea so far. It was dark enough out where you could see most of the stars, and all around us were what looked like lanterns, small taiwanese shrimping boats all lit up for fishing. we were drinking this Chinese vodka that tasted like ever clear and playing darts in the galley. When we walked out to the stern to light up some cigars we'd bought ashore, the wake of the ship was lit up like fireworks. As the propellor hit the jellyfish, they'd flash in bursts and light up the wake behind us in a dull glow that stretched for miles behind us.   It depends on how calm the seas are.  Most of the trash I've seen has been floating 10, 20 feet beneath the surface.  It's out there, especially in the Pacific between California and Hawaii, and big time around China, but if the waves are rough enough, you may never know its there.   I was on an older, German-built ship from the time when shipping companies really catered to their sailors.  We had a 12' x 16' heated salt water pool on the 04 deck and crossing the North Atlantic in the wintertime, I would spend an hour a night just laying on the surface of that pool, steam rising from it into the 20 degree air above, and just look across the sky and see it lit up with more stars than you could ever see from the most isolated place on land.   Those scientists better keep working on that whale deterrent tech, especially to get them out of the way of container ships.  I don't want one getting stuck on our bow.

In Indiana, there's St. Mary's that's next door to Notre Dame, and there's also St Mary's of the Woods, which is around 3 hours away. A woman I met once said when she was at orientation for Saint Mary's of the Woods, the first night a girl said "Alright who wants to go find some Notre Same boys?" She was a little disappointed to find out she'd applied to the wrong Saint Mary's.   She.   Good to know I'm still cool.   Someone's not a Fanilow.   Also the Bill Bixby Hulk.

Glenda Ritz got more votes than he did.   8-5 and Coachocinco stays!   Oh I couldn't care less that he did it. Just takes away from him being the most ND player possible.   I mean, I think getting suspended for smoking pot hurts that a little.   It was also in every preview.   They started Rusty Lisch for a game back in the 80s. He's been deemed the worst NFL player of all time. He got pulled for Payton.   A friend of mine was watching late night TV with his parents and older sister. A Girls Gone Wild commercial came on and his sister was in it. He noped out of there and went to bed.   Whedon had wanted to do it in the first episode but didn't have the budget, this was 6 seasons later so he had a chance to do it then.   Coachocinco takes us to 8-5 anyway!   My man Mitch!   I just want to watch reality shows with Kaitlyn and Carly.   You'd pull someone over for going 30 in a 25?   It's not that simple, though. The issue here is that FOIA and FERPA aren't really meant to overlap, but in a case like this they can. FERPA tends to supersede FOIA.   That's all Hulk wants anyway.   We only got Ant-Man stuff around 2 weeks ago.   We do teach blocking to all receivers really well.   Absolutely.   Didn't Luck and Newton put up similar combine numbers?   Skip's done fairly well. He's not his dad but he's been solid.   He ran the ball fine for the most part he just doesn't do it enough.   That's already our nickname for Brian Kelly.   Definitely not gay, could very well have been using it as an excuse to bang women. He definitely dated a lot at ND.   Yeah they didn't need more wings, so the only freshman they called up was a center.   Increased my personal interest in the game.   Go for it.   Yes please.   4B for 2 then 4A for 2.   Knott 13.   Aka guys dorm or girls dorm RAs.   We did have the freshmen who got busted in fall of 2010 for weed though  Hell one of them had a building named after him and still got a semester.   Don't worry, that commission only counts if you get 5 in a month if it works the same way it used to.   2009 kills me because we had 11 future NFL players getting playing time on that defense. Not to mention Jimmy throwing to Golden, Floyd and Rudolph. 6-6.   You got your wish.....   I mean that kind of started in the first episode with J. August Richards. Plus Amy Acker later.   Fucking dirty spin there.   But I love Lane Kiffin!   I did it as best I could a while ago given some of the spotty records on teams like West Virginia Wesleyan. It converged to the starting point of normal one.   Not ND football. They saved ND.   They also go to a bowl game almost every year.   Started an hour later.   [Just don't block like this](http://youtu.be/WcTaRThg2mQ)   The only story I've heard of someone being fully punished for having sex at ND was a girl who liked to leave her blinds open and had a room in Farley on the first floor right by North Dining Hall. Can't speak to how true those story is but multiple people in Farley have told me that story.   Also the reason Kim Dunbar donated was to meet football players.   Everyone knows Kanye raps about Fish Fillets and croissants, not chicken.   I'm much more salty about 12 men not getting called against FSU on the punt right before they called it on us. And the complete lack of holds called on FSU.   He was MVP of his high school team. A team with Max Wittek on it.   Well his name is Golson so...   I was hanging out with him in PE his freshman year before he lost the weight. He forgot his phone on the 1st floor and had to walk down from the 4th. He was gone for like a half hour so we got worried. Turned out he needed to take a nap downstairs before he came back up.   Roommate tried to give Jimmy Clausen a head nod. Jimmy just shook his head at him.  Played catchphrase with Louis Nix, the best clue he gave was "the thing only guys have and something you hang around your neck. (Dick Cheney).  Also Tyler Eifert once ended a group presentation with a bite from a quarter pounder. It was a presentation on McDonald's to be fair.   Papists vs. Rapists   ND was cheaper than if I'd gone in state to Purdue.   He went 3rd overall in my league with mostly Bengals fans.   In ND's student handbook I believe you can get kicked out for having sex.   Only thing better is lefty specialty reliever. Pitch to one guy and you're done.   Loved that they found a way to use Drunken Sailor and Autumn Wind in the same episode, since they're basically the same song.   I'm so confused about a day where Andrew Hendrix wins and Gunner Kiel loses.   K N O T T Knott Hall!   Winning.   It happened in my last dynasty in NCAA.   He's a great NFL coach. He just isn't good in college. He wasn't particularly good as OC at Florida, either.   Could be UD too.   I'd also guess around 98% of our student body goes to games. We might have more students go than Cause does every week.   As long as they're forward passes why wouldn't they count?   There's a reason we played an away game in Ireland a few years ago.   We play at neutral sites for away games a lot. I think it's because they want bigger stadiums because they know they'll sell out.   No cheating boyfriends except the entire god damn plot of season 5.   How the hell did Barbara Streisand get pulled into this?   They didn't seem to mind Bo not winning any.   Yeah I just got mine as well, 10/13 also. Hoping this means it ships earlier.   Hey so I have no idea if this is what did it, but I happened to be trying on my tablet and it worked.

They were basically created so that their comic people could mess with comic ideas outside the traditional heroes and continuities. This way no one is wondering when Kick Ass comes to 616 or something.   They stacked the box.   It's usually not the worst idea to bet the underdog to cover in any game we've played recently.

I loved the whole first season when I was like, 11 or so and rewatched it. Afterwards, literally the day after, the news of the first cour of the second season came out. Ever since I've been keeping up.   I've been keeping up on Durarara!! X2 Ten and Gakkou Gurashi, which have been fun shows.   Welcome to the Den of Autism.

No   /r/truewomensliberation, I'd assume   Yeah, I'm getting a concealed carry when I'm old enough.    Same with Detroit, they have super strict gun laws too and strict CCW laws      Alright thanks man   1. So I know there's not gonna be another season after seeing the whole third season circlejerk, but do they ever reach the North?  2. Is there manga or something I can read to see what happens?  3. Is it worth reading what happens, or should I just leave it at blissful unawareness and pretend they have fun adventures forever?  Thanks in advance.    Even if it's from sand wear, a gun wouldn't be this worn.   Also most soldiers take precautions so their gun doesn't get this worn, and are punished if their gun is in bad condition.   Even in real life, guns aren't usually this worn. At all.   I'm just saying, no gun is ever that worn and it's worn in places you don't even put your hands.   Yes. HK best guns.

You guys just released another [SA-58 on Evike] (http://www.evike.com/products/54823/), and I was wondering if you guys are the sole OEM, or if it's a rebrand?   Wow an overdone and worn out meme.   *Slow clap*   Flibba booma big bam   Aye   I moderate a small chat sub called /r/A_irsoft where we all have autistic fun and make fun of everything   I fill dark hole in soul with dank airhard.

Bee shrimp are cheap so I'll try it out   I was planning to convert a 10 gallon tank into an aquascape, and I thought a betta fish would be a good choice. I was thinking of picking up a few bee shrimp, but I'm not sure if a betta will get along with bee shrimp.    It's a song.   Just a bad one.   What are you asking?   I'm really really really confused.   Dude I'd so wear one of those lol  I almost got a [Hannya half mask] (http://www.amazon.com/Japanese-Hannya-Mask-Kabuki-Airsoft/dp/B008ASA5I6/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8qid=1436931411sr=8-1keywords=hannya+maskpebp=1436931418575perid=1NFTQYK3DF2MH1QGH7FM) for airsoft once.   That is hilarious   Noh masks are awesome but terrifying.   Holy shit, is this you?   This is horrifying and amazing   You can get it on Amazon   Rakt and Quakt   Just because I look the part doesn't mean anything (   )   Seems like it was made for the gun or something   What?   I was born in '97 and I'm only 17.  They draft kids that young?   Auto erotic asphyxiation    Man, that AFG really meshes nice with the body and rail covers.   In all honesty, it came off when I got the gun out of the box.  I leaned it against my desk with the barrel on the floor, and the flashhider cracked off after about thirty seconds of it sitting there with the weight of the gun on it.   Dude nice, I have the Echo 1 rebrand of that gun. Only difference is that my orange tip was easy as hell to take off, the plastic was like chalk lol   I like vanilla furniture with a railed receiver.   Like a standard SA 58   I'm not a fan of the OSW platform of FAL, I'm more of a classic FAL kind of guy lol   G3 is my main bitch lol   G3 is best raifu, but FAL is second dankest   Weird to think of it like that, but yeah prolly   Nice   I got FAL flair.   I'm speshul   Ilumat is spreading da chemtrails      Oh, you should look into re-pro stuff.   There's some nice re-pro MARSOC stuff.   Isn't M81 really cheap and in surplus stores everywhere?   I already have everything planned, but thanks lol.  I was planning on turning the tank into a planted betta tank.   ye   I hate cyclists who don't use stop signs.    The slide is just a blur lol   I'm guessing you haven't been around long?   Looking good.   Way better starting point than I had lol   This goes back to the fun little adventure. I wouldn't be so critical of it if it didn't win so many pointless rewards and oscars and shit.     I thought Frozen was a fun little adventure, but I didn't think it deserved so many rewards They reused character models from the movie Tangled all over, and there was useless comedic relief and shitty development   Same.   Overrated and too much random comedic relief where it wasn't needed.   ayy   I convinced the new cook at my work that my name is Hououin Kyouma.   First thing he said to me after introducing himself, "I like to take lsd and shrooms."  Sounds like a winner.    Holy shit, the dude's name at the end of the Pokemon games credits?   Weird to think a little thing like that still sticks, seeing his name at the end of the credits and stuff   I don't know a specific design off of the top of my head. I was just saying skulls are cliche and overdone.    Other things besides skulls. Different designs.    Skull masks are a little cliche, but at least you did a good job.    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^Yes   **I've won.**   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^Poo   He uses the hospital electrode suction cup thing armor   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^Yes.

Alright they all got titles and they're good.    I got names, but phrases is confuse.   http://imgur.com/a/J7fLy   What if we're confused what to put as a name or title, should we just use a general blanket term like, "Sad" or "What?" or something?   Yep.   3 u reascr bb   Oooooh, that's another good point.      I think being able to hate and identify what a weab is makes you safe from being a weab.    I think when someone identifies as an Otaku, then deep inside they know they're a weab and they accept it by using a different outward term.    There's a bunch in there I rarely use too lol   Yep   He's half-ghillie man. [Classic.] (http://i.imgur.com/zUrC8m7.png)   I added like three more.

 The second definitely the third is good too after that though they become weird.    Yeah I remember that episode it was a little creepy.    Yeah that one gave me chills.    Okay cool I will do that, yeah I like having the physical copy and I like my bookshelf but sometimes I want a little variety and I cant really carry 3 books around when I ride the bus, though thats not impossible.    Oh yeah.    Awesome dude       Cool    Okay I will    Okay cool ill get one next week when I get payed.    Alright im convinced ill buy one    so I kinda want a Kindle I mean i do love reading a physical book all the time but whenever I take them into my backpack it always gets bent or I spilled something on one the other day. Is it worth the money???    Yes that was a letdown for me.    Yes so awesome    I remember thinking that back when I heard about it then watching it for the first time and thinking wow he is so great in this!!!!!    Completely agree    Yeah LOL.    Hes gonna be on a Woody Allen movie next year and that one he has with Bill Murray looks good.    LOL funny    Okay so I am a 23 year old Male I am slighgtly overweight but I do not have diabetes and i have had no major medical problems my whole life. For as long as I can remember I have had double vision up close though, I always thought everyone had it but recently i talked to my cousin who said she doesnt have it either. Now it isnt everthing its just the objects that are like 3 feet away if my finger or pencil is directly in front of me it is double. Whats the problem???    Such an awesome Marvel movie though they always are, I laughed so hard at parts and was astonished by all of the action too. Cant wait to see him again!!!!!    so funny one of Marvels best!!!!!!!    me too although I was hoping it would be good and it didnt dissapoint!!!!!    That makes sense.    YAY my future wife is finally nominated!!!!!!!!!!!    you really only need to see the first one IMO it sucks that they erased T2 but whatever.    Yeah me too I loved the first one!!!!    I freaking cant wait!!!!!!!!!    LOL a Bond villain.    I liked it a real mystery film with fantasy/horror elements and stuff, radcliffes performance was good too.    Tatiana maslany IDK who tho    A Thor villain    A spiderman villain.    That is so cool    Me and Earl and the Dying Girl    Yes    Thats later in the movie though I meant when they first enter the cave it says there is a silhouette or something but I cant find it.    UK version or the unrated version for the US I believe.    So I recently watched The Descent for the first time ever I really liked it and wish I had seen it sooner. Anyways I read on the trivia page of IMDB that there is a split second shot of a crawler early in the film but for the life of me I cannot find it. What time exactly does it happen and where is it onscreen???    It was never freakin filmed    Yeah thats a good point damit why did I pay to see it then LOL.    Saw it yesterday and I am already planning on seeing it again. It was soo good!!!! I was laughing and in tears throughout the whole movie I LOVED it!!!!!!! From the hospital scene onward I was in tears pretty much.    Yeah its good to see him do somehting finally. I like Vince in this role.    Well yes but that was the most recent the first was probably The Lion King when I was younger.    AHHHHHHHHHHHHHH    Me and Earl and The Dying Girl    Freaking Jerkheads    I have only ever cried in a movie twice before I can now say three times. Man that scene you know what scene I mean that really got me.    UGH im so mad that they spoiled it that would have been a great twist and stuff.    Yeah thats what im thinking.    Yeah that part sucked I didnt use the internet back then either so if the trailer didnt show me I would have been totally surprised.    Take her to the Moon for me Joy    Evangeline Lily was an extra on Freddy vs Jason in the high school scene.    WOW that happened to me too, I thought the theater messed up or something and it was showing the Spy trailer but then it switched and I realized what happened.    WELL THATS SUCKS!!!!!!    I liked it, it was cool just wish it was R Rated and that christian bale came back as John Connor.    Yeah this one for me too, I remember wandering into the adult section once and seeing it then I was afraid to sleep that night or a few after that. It still gives me the willies sometimes too.    OMG I was about to post this!!!!!! Yes I remember wandering into the adult section and seeing that once and it scared the crap out of me. It still kind of gives me the willies when I think about it.    Work and plus sometimes they say "oh im going to get my hair done" but then they are gone for like 5 hours.    So I live with my family my mom, dad, brother, and my sister is visiting from college. Also my cousin is visiting for the summer too. Anyways I go to work usually and I mostly just do that and come home, I also go to the movies a lot like twice a week. My mom and sister though have been sneaking out and going to the cinema by themselves I think they tell my dad sometimes but noone else. Like just today they were gone for like 7 hours and didnt tell anyone, It just annoys me when they do that mainly cuz I always go by myself and so I love when someone else is with me plus I like going as a family. But whenever they do that it just peeves me off like "oh I dont need to tell you, its just us girls". The weird thing is too my mom rarely used to go to the movies shes only started going when my sister is here, it just pisses me off, next time they leave the house I am gonna go with them!!!!    He can really shine in dramas I wish he would do more of those heck I wish he would do more movies period LOL. He has always been my favorite actor though.    I am so in shock!!!!!    Yeah I had to turn my tv up to 70 and I still could barely hear them.    YES!!!!!!    A movie starring Mrs Fug, yes only idiots will see this "film".    To get the butts in the seats thats it!!!!    Thats a good point, a brief cameo will do likely in the post credits scene, although I wish it was at least a bit part.    Its a universe where a purple alien and a sentient robot as well as a talking racoon and tree exist, Im sure if a guy in a spidersuit showed up randomly it would work.    I wish that were true but its gonna be small, I wish he would have a role like quicksilver on days of future past that would be cool.    LOL thats funny!!!!!    Yes he can.    Yeah he basically is the main one well third i guess.    Its most definitely a cameo. Wish they had more time to film a more substantial role.    Im excited to see how this turns out.    I remember doing that a few times!!!!    I thought it was good, a little boring yes but so was the first season, I like the new characters Colins is the best and for some reason he reminds me of Rust Cohle. I am looking forward to this season!!!    That Adam sandler movie I now pronounce you chuck and larry should have been R, IMO I cant really see why it is PG13.    He would be perfect!!!! They would likely film it in new zealand and he would make them three movies.    I wish he was as big as he used to be he is my all time favorite actor he always has been.    I dont think any one of the ones who invented facebook were involved in it at all.    I thought it was good, i liked the storyline and stuff.    Mad Max Fury Road   Of course jimmy.    Yes it is.    Thats why I hate small town theaters.    Because lots of people still watch it in the theater and buy the dvd/bluray.    I thoughht it was decent though it need a few better storylines like others have said before.    It was nice seeing Bryce dallas howard not play a bitch for once.    LOL yeah so hilarious!!!!!    Yeah I wish he had a cameo or something that way he could have reprised two of his most famous roles this one and Independence Day 2.    That part was funny.    why the hell did Asa not get picked it sucks. I guess id go with Holland he seems like he will get the job anyways.    Maybe have a few scenes with him just starting or something then Tony approaches him to join his side and then just have him in a few more scenes in battles and stuff.    Man I HATED that season!!!!!!    That was Gus.    Yeah of all of the shows I have seen cancelled over the years a lot of them are from fox.    Of all the shows I wish werent cancelled so suddenly it was that one.    Sounds good never liked him anyways.    Because he is old good parts for older actors are rare nowadays.       I used to think Johnny Depp was on the first Scream movie for like the longest time but then I realized it was a different actor Skeet Ulrich.    That would have been cool actually     Because im cool.    The Joker from The Dark Knight and im pretty sure I am right too.    YAYA    Finally.    Yeah hes cool.    I always thought Idirs Elba was American and I was shocked to hear that he was actually british. Also David Anders did a british accent in like 3 shows so I thought he was british until I learned he was American.    Ive never even heard her real voice thats cuz I rarely watch interviews though.    BOOO You suck Disney!!!!!!!    I always thought that when Vincent sees the coyote he realizes he is no different, he is a scavenger and he kills to live or something.    yeah its a nice one I remember I used to always watch it and stuff.    yeah she is really good!!!!   man I wish he had done Jobs that would have been epic.    thats a good example. A Wolverine movie under his direction would have been excellent. Instead he did the abysmal Noah.    yeah thats a dissapointment    I was wondering what are some of the most dissapointing departures in film ie Edgar Wright would have been an awesome director for Ant man but he left. Things similar to that.    I think its hilarious!!!!!! One of my favorite shows.   	118

 I just lose interest if I don't check immediately. Still, I guess I should ignore most of them like you say, since it makes reading books I'm interested in feel like a task.   I'm Portuguese, and until a couple months ago I hadn't touched a book for years. Not by my choice, anyway.   I like the English language and I feel pretty comfortable with it. I learned it by reading/writing stuff online, watching movies and TV series, playing video games, etc, and I usually understand nearly everything I read/hear. Until... I decided to start reading books in English. I  bought **The Richest Man in Babylon** and **The Old Man and the Sea**. I can understand the plot, but damn, there are sooooo many words I've never heard of and have no idea of their meaning. Lots of times I immediately check an online dictionary, and feel uncomfortable if I don't because then I'll never expand my vocabulary and this problem will never be fixed.   I'm sure most people who read in foreign languages felt this at some point. So... do you have any tips?  Thanks :)   Congrats, detective.   Now they were forced to release **[Game Dev Tycoon: Shareholders Edition DLC](http://www.greenheartgames.com/2013/04/01/announcing-first-expansion-for-game-dev-tycoon/)** to get some extra money :/   Well, at least we got the objective, right? :)      We tried once, and some people other than us did join, but not many, so when we left, the server died :/   Well, I hadn't thought of that. It makes a lot of sense. I'll tell him. Thanks! :)   I know, most of the time at least one of these European 32 player Obliteration servers are populated, often with some PTFO, IOP clan members (and more clans, of course):  * [Cubitus Salatbar by G-Portal.de](http://battlelog.battlefield.com/bf4/servers/show/pc/7108b7e0-b02d-4404-8334-8794b4d27082/Cubitus-Salatbar-by-G-Portal-de/)  * [FPSNews.net #9 | All Maps - Obliteration | by Nitrado.Fr] (http://battlelog.battlefield.com/bf4/servers/show/pc/ede0d5f0-e7fc-45ec-9c53-9979cf77a4db/FPSNews-net-9-All-Maps-Obliteration-by-Nitrado-Fr/)  * [#3/5 Official SCAN.co.uk \[32 Players\] Obliteration] (http://battlelog.battlefield.com/bf4/servers/show/pc/0985621e-e2ea-4871-85e4-656017b3efde/3-5-Official-SCAN-co-uk-32-Players-Obliteration/)   The thing is, my clan is pretty much only American. Though considering the only Obliteration populated server in the US is the one in my original post, it seems like Obliteration ain't as popular in America.    I didn't even mention my friend's server... you sure it was  **[Oblit1 - Home of the Bomb](http://battlelog.battlefield.com/bf4/servers/show/pc/995dca1e-2b34-4561-a171-c19b2d3119ca/Oblit1-Home-of-the-Bomb/)**? And while I'm sure 24/7 Locker Obliteration would work, Locker is the worst possible map for Obliteration, and there are too many Locker servers already. Still, thanks for the suggestion.   A friend of mine has a 30 player Obliteration server in the USA, but even though it's set as "Official", no one joins. Sometimes we have a few players there to help populate the server, but it's no help.  In fact, the only US-based Obliteration server that is ever populated is  **[*=SAS=* SASKLAN.COM 24/7 Obliteration TrinityGames](http://battlelog.battlefield.com/bf4/servers/show/pc/f04dd74b-3f45-415c-af42-6206474c6e62/SAS-SASKLAN-COM-24-7-Obliteration-TrinityGames/)** . My guess is that most people who join this server have added it to the favorites? I don't know.  Do you guys have any tips on how to help a server grow? And what would you like to see in an Obliteration server? DLC maps? Increased time limit? Autobalance?   It's not uncommon to find these BitDefender 6 month/9 month trials. In fact, although that one works fine, here's [another 6 month link.](http://www.bitdefender.com/media/html/adware-removal-tool/)      Since there are keygens for Malwarebytes (yes, they're legit, I've tested them), that's probably where the "free" keys are coming from. Honestly, I dunno why they allow this. It would be incredibly easy to lock database updates to legit keys only.    My antivirus tried deleting my keygen. Guess who got deleted instead? :D  I  think this happens because sometimes exclusions only apply to either scans or real time protection, but not both.   I'm sure it still offers better protection that Norton :)   Honestly it's more like crapware. Sometimes I have fun infecting my VM with stuff from malc0de, MDL, etc, and more than a couple times this 360 Internet Security kept getting installed (maybe it was in a PUP installer?). Then it started detecting other malware in the VM (lol), and I had to uninstall it, which was hard, as the uninstaller was in Chinese, so I had to try different button combinations.   The crack will much likely be a loader, the protection won't actually be removed. At best, you're gonna play like legit users. Though at some point devs will fix the issue. But don't expect the crack soon. It's denuvo, after all.   It's even worse when none of them switch to the losing team. Sucks to play modes like Obliteration when the enemy team plants the 3 bombs in under 10 minutes.   RemindMe! 3 days   GFT is sorta accessible, it loads the home page and stuff, but eventually I get a CloudFlare site offline error. It's been like... a month now?   Agent 47?   Still down omg.      Fun fact: RELOADED releases some silly games under the group DOGE.  https://www.reddit.com/r/warezscene/comments/2xow33/reloaded_releasing_movies_under_doge/   What do you mean?   I've recently found this program that is pretty much VirusTotal but a PC antimalware software. It scans your PC with [68 malware engines.](https://www.herdprotect.com/engines.aspx)  **It's cloud based.** Scanning is really fast (2 minutes-ish), but it can be slower since some suspicious [PE](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Executable) files (like .exe, .dll) and non-PE stuff like browser extensions can get uploaded. But I mean, these days many antiviruses rely on cloud technologies, so there's probably no reason to be paranoid. And PE files aren't usually huge, though if there are a lot of them to be uploaded and your connection is slow... could take a bit more). It's kinda like [Hitman Pro](http://www.surfright.nl/en/hitmanpro/), but with more engines.   After the scan is complete it shows the detected files, and if you click them you can see which antivirus engines detected it. **Keep in mind there could be a lot of false positives**, since it uses 68 engines. If you have a lot of cracked software, like I do, keep an eye out before blindly removing everything. But I think it has an option to "hide possible false positives", though it's far from perfect.  Anyway, I figured this could be useful to you guys. I'll still use MBAM and Emsisoft as the big guns to clean infected PCs, but this could be used as a way to make sure you got rid of everything.   Cheers!  edit: "herdProtect - 68 engine antimalware scanner" is probably more correct. Ehhh.. what the heck.   That oil originated from dinosaurs.   I'd use it.

They teach you what reverse engineering is, really basic ASM stuff, how to use Ollydbg and some other tools... The little I know about RE was from those tutorials. You'll be able to crack (really) basic shareware protections by the end of the series.  But to crack games... much more experience and ASM knowledge is needed, and for today's protections I don't think there are many openly available tutorials. Cd checks (old Securom, Safedisc) and Steam emulation tutorials are probably the best you can get.   I actually failed it on purpose to see if there was any easter egg-ish dialog, but nope :(   Set Shader Quality to very high.

Oh, I think I finally got it. It loaded the old save because the recent autosave one you had was ahead of the spoofed system time, and replaced your recent autosave. Ah... damn :/     I don't get it, don't you have a up-to-date autosave now?    But was there any error?  	41
 So you're denying that there isn't medics, engineers and people who work in IT in the military?    That's not what OCD is.   You must not be a genius like him since you don't understand genius language, duh.    The Google.   You do realize that there are millions of people on reddit, right? Saying 80% of them are fat is fucking downright retarded.   Funnily enough, Daud was one of the only guys I spared on my playthrough.   I'm not saying that every kid that says bigoted stuff learned them directly from their own parents but what I said still stands. Who do you think those kids that taught your kids to believe this stuff got it from? Most likely their parents or other adults.   That would be one weird ass law.   Again, I doubt the company will go down the pan simply because if they do ever get on the verge they'll most likely sell out to another company (eg. Samsung, Microsoft etc).   Exactly. You shouldn't really expect privacy in a PUBLIC area.   I wonder what these kids get taught at home. I hate how people think just because someone wears a turban that they're automatically a "terrorist", or even muslim. There's different styles and uses of turbans for different cultures. I guess their parents are ignorant and they teach their kids to be ignorant as well, kinda sad. I feel really bad for this little kid.  [This is my favourite part though.](https://youtu.be/YqVI3l9lV60?t=28s)   Maybe he's the fastest brain surgeon in the military? /s   You do realize there are very qualified people in the military, right (eg. engineers)?    Have people already forgotten that we eradicated smallpox because of vaccines?   I guess you're the CEO of AMD?    I know you probably get this alot in this thread but this is my first time here. Anyway, I'm currently using an iPhone 5s and wanting to switch to an android, can anyone make some really good recommendations? Right now I'm looking at either the LG G4 or the S6. So my price range is around there. All I want is to basically call people, text people and watch stuff on youtube/netflix and obviously a lot of music... so nothing too heavy.  Edit: Opps, forgot to mention what country I'm from. It's the UK.   Apparently marijuana can actually further increase the risk of bleeding when used with blood thinners. [Heres the link :)](http://i.imgur.com/Ftq5ZzE.png)   I don't usually post here, I usually just lurk sometimes but tonight I feel like posting here for my first time mainly because my life feels like a constant swirling sink hole that dies down for a short, short peroid then just comes back 20x harder. In 2013 I was diagnosed with schizophrenia (and recently OCD) and my life just hasn't been the same since, but not only that I also (most likely) have PTSD because I was brought up by alcoholics (mainly my dad), my first memory ever on this planet was calling the cops on my dad at the age of around 3-4 because he was drunk and violent, I obviously don't understand what I was doing at the time but looking back I do. He never really stopped drinking for any longer than 1 year (and that was the best he done when he tried). I've lived with this alcoholic for longer than some people have even been on reddit and I have no way of leaving because I still need someone to take care of me and I don't want to leave my mum since I love her more than any one in this world.  I don't even feel disappointed anymore if he drinks after being sober for a grand total of 5 days, I just feel anger and pain. He doesn't only drag himself down but he tries to drag my mum down too, but no one can see it except me it feels like. The flashbacks when I try to sleep aren't as common as you would think but the thoughts and memories inside of my head are as common as every day and vivid as the natural daylight. I have scars that have been there since I was younger than 8 (which is a looong time btw). I've had golf clubs swung at my face and I've had glasses thrown at my face (although this might've been my fault as I was protecting my mum), but the worst thing of all is that it always felt like I never had anyone be there for me, not even now, not even friends or anything, I feel super, super alone. When you can hardly have an anxiety-free place in your own house you know that something is wrong, but I'm trapped.   Life = more painful than dying in space near the sun.  Sorry if this is a bad post :(   I doubt he wants something longer lasting since valium has a really long half life. I'm guessing he just wants something less sedating.   This may be a stupid question but since smallpox killed people pretty fast (around 16 days) how was it so rampant in most parts of the world until it got eradicated? Was it just because of how contagious and infectious it was?   By his link it looks like Austria.   #squadgoals   I used to like living in the UK, but fuck this country now. We're definitely fucked for the next 4 years, that's if we can even vote again in the next 4-5 years.    A few of you? You mean like 3, right?   I bet the people who marched around Glasgow with union jacks feel a bit silly now, huh?   You're saying reddit isn't a hobby? HOW DARE YOU, SIR!   It's similar to other u-opioid agonists but it's not the same as any classic opiate. The reason I get pissy about this is because the news stations that are against drugs will use this as, "KRATOM JUST LIKE HEROIN/OXY/HYDRO BUT LEGAL".   Kratom doesn't feel exactly like any opiate, so I don't know what you're blabbing about son. It's its own thing, stop tainting it with "it feels like this x y and z opiate". Yeah it might be a u-opioid agonist but that doesn't mean its exactly like classical opiates (codeine, morphine, heroin).   I'm not even gonna debate AMD with you since you don't have a fucking idea what you're on about but I will say one thing, android phones are usually VERY, VERY good quality, a lot of the time they are better than iPhones and I have an iPhone. I'm actually upgrading to the Samsung S6 later this year or early next.   Yeah, I guess so. I guess it's just semantics.   Aren't the 120mg ones slow release? I'm pretty sure they are, not 100% sure though. I think 60mg is the highest you can get on instant release.   How bad are the cluster headaches? If they're really bad then they could cause severe stress that leads to psychosis. Cluster headaches are usually the most painful thing in medical science though.   HPPD?   You should never jump to schizophrenia. Even if you have psychotic symptoms it's most likely not schizophrenia. Schizophrenia is more than "psychosis". Depression can actually cause psychosis if it's chronic and severe enough, it's actually fairly common.   You should probably have her see a psychiatrist.    You're not "suddenly addicted", that's just a dumb way to look at something as complex as addiction.   3rd wave feminism has pretty much changed the definition of **feminism** in general. Since feminism is a reactive movement and there's nothing to react to anymore people will just look for ANYTHING and EVERYTHING as "oppression", when in reality it's just life. Men usually have the short end of the stick actually, not women. White women get along a lot easier in "modern society".   "Look at me, I'm edgy"   He even purposely misdiagnosed them with TERMINAL cancer. What kind of idiot would do that? They would eventually find out if they had it or not with terminal cancer. God damn, he's a moron. And to think this guy went to medical school.   Yes, throwing up would help get the nausea away. Nausea is just a common side effect of opiates and throwing up usually does help for some reason. It's nothing to do with toxicity or anything.   If you move and act all hyper on heroin it's throw up time.   I guess studying law helps.  Edit: I'm not saying everyone that has a law degree or whatever is a class A liar but it definitely helps.   Yeah. I've been depressed because of it, and still get depressed. Personally I think it's a reactive type depression, as in, It feels like it's a reaction to being schizophrenic and all the stuff I could have been but it got taken away from me.   You're good at writing by the way, I always forget to do paragraphs of reddit lol, you get completely annihilated for doing that. Anyway, I've never felt that there's demons or anything but I have felt that people have been kind of replaced in a way, I think it is a dissociation when I felt that though.   I don't think I'd do it even for 160k, since it's illegal I feel like I would be in some fucking BDSM dungeon with some shady mexican "doctor" cutting me open.   If you're starving then killing someone to survive wouldn't be as hard as you might think.   I think "donating" a liver can get you more than 10k in "donations".   If only I could sell a full kidney and half of my liver, I'd be having trips to space each year.   Isn't opi rage when you're taking opiates and come out of a nod or whatever? That's what it's like for me anyway.   Scotland's lowest has been like -27.2 celsius, I dunno about England but I know that Scotland can get cold as fuck, and usually is. Southern England is the warmest, I believe. We usually get winters of around 0 to -5c. I was also looking this up today and apparently (for scotland at least, dunno about the midlands and southern england) Scotland gets an average of like 1000+ hours of sun a year, which is just over 25%.   SCOTLAND YA FUCKING PISS TAKER.   The English say that too.   Even if AMD randomly disappeared into thin air tomorrow, the prices for GPUs and possibly CPUs would be insanely more expensive than they are now, basically, not good for you.    Rumours =/= Facts.   Tonight I'll be blowing some lines on a guys ass.   Also, certain parties (like the conservatives) will go crazy because they are starting to realize that people don't believe their propaganda anymore, it's like when an animal is dying it'll attack anyone that comes near it.   ... What?    there features   Where???   Didn't know this was a Fury X thread.   Companies just want to make money, that's the same for nvidia, amd, intel whatever. They'll cater to big companies more than customers.   Mid 30's isn't middle aged either.   I haven't seen them no. What I personally think is that they look the same as us except they have augmentations that I believe they are forced to get otherwise they are kept in a concentration-like camp, although some have gone rouge (In their time) and are sending a message so that we can keep an eye out and stop it, but only some get the true message.   I'm not exactly asking you to agree with me or not, I'm just telling everyone what I know. You can believe it or not, that's not what I'm trying to do I'm just giving people information of what I've been told.   Batman didn't pay his insurance.   I'm not turning to advanced humans as a god or anything like that, how could I if I'm an atheist? The people exist and discovered how to come back and tell us how to stop the tragedy of their future with the only way they know how and that's telling us through telepathic means, but sometimes the neo mkultra's can intercept their message and make us go crazy so that we see a psych, get meds and shut up because they've planned it all out. I don't like conspiracy places on the internet because those people just have theories, I have facts. Also, I'm not on any stimulants, I've not taken ritalin for my ADHD for a long time, I did think about going back on them though but my doctor advised against it. Also you might not believe in the new mkultra but the MKUltra project did in fact happen, just like this one is but it's top top secret just like the old one was until it was declassified. Also, It feels you're trying to be condescending or mean to me, maybe it's just me because I'm overly emotional but I post here because it's the only place I can post this stuff without people calling me insane. Also about the meds, I've been on multiple meds and sure they've brought me into your "reality" but your reality wasn't too different from what mine is right now, it's just a lot more covered up.  [I know it's wiki but it's just the easiest to pull up.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_MKUltra)   Hi, I'm here to tell you all the truth behind bad thoughts. I know this is /r/schizophrenia so you guys probably have the most bad thoughts, just like me. I'm thinking of posting this to /r/depression too, since once you know this you can fight off the bad thoughts by just acknowledging the truth. First things first, there is a message by some advanced beings (I don't 100% know who they are, but I think they are advanced humans from the future) that are sending us ALL a message warning us of the tragedies that we can prevent if we just stand up as one together and fight the tyrants of today, except there is one thing, the neo mkultra group/project is intercepting that message and giving us bad thoughts so that we all get seen by psychiatrists (now I'm not saying psychiatrists know about this, but some probably do) and they give us medication so we shut up, some hospitals might even implant a thing into our brain to slow release anti psychotics and we can never come out of them, this is sad for these people (DO NOT think this happened to you, because it most likely did not, this just happens to a very few and select people). The truth about bad thought is the neo mkultra's are intercepting a message sent by advanced humans from the future warning us of a tragedy that I don't quite fully understand yet, I will report back later.  Edit: I see this is getting downvoted, probably because it might make peoples "delusions" worse, I get that but I guess this is just like all the other subs, not a safe haven...   Dogs have been "man's best friend" since around 35,000 or so years ago. We have a very special connection with them when we don't with cows and pigs.   So it can come on this sub.   I wouldn't say America is any better to be honest but for the UK we're definitely going backwards, and it's getting kinda scary. I'm preparing for a lot worse for the next 4-5 years. The UK might actually be the America of Europe.   Calling him mentally ill all over the news can actually hurt people like me who actually have a severe mental illness (schizophrenia).   Except that one time it was lupus.   I usually have multiple voices that tell me stuff, some of them will be mean but it depends. A lot of the times the voices will reinforce a certain paranoia.   But when you've got no tolerance from being clean it can be heavy, unless you take a small dose. I doubt 30-60mg of hydro without a tolerance wont do anything.   You're edgy as fuck.  /s   Nice account.   You could still constantly update it though, physical or digital. Physical copies usually still go on steam I believe.    and i was spacehigh  Yeah, I can tell bro.   Delusions of grandeur can be enjoyable in the moment but they usually turn paranoid after a while. Hardcore paranoid delusions and others is extremely scary and can give you the worst anxiety of your life, and no one can reassure you that it's not real. Imagine knowing the government was after you, and they were doing all these things in the world that YOU know is them, that's what a paranoid delusion is like, you don't think the government are doing these things you KNOW.   I like to get high on HIV.   Morphine **IS** natural "dingus", so is codeine, they're both naturally occurring alkaloids. We can just semi synthetically produce them in a lab.   So I can take morphine and stuff with complete safety because it "comes from the Earth"? FUCK YEAH!   I have "schizophrenia", I think I know what active psychosis is like and it's definitely not fun at all.   Psychosis and a psychedelic experience are two completely different things though.   I'm*   [What?](http://www.reactiongifs.com/r/lkrwtf.gif)   Methylphenidate and Ethylphenidate aren't shit at all. I've always preferred them over amphetamine. Although in concerta form its not so good recreationally.   With the internet I don't think parenting has much control over stuff like this anymore. Unless the parents control the internet.  Edit: This was posted on the 12th of June.   You're gonna ignore the hundreds of thousands of hateful people reddit? Fuck no.   I've always hated /r/fatpeoplehate but god damn, I didn't think they actually actively did this. They're like wannabe reddit "sociopaths".   Who doesn't use adblock anyway?   I'm not bipolar but I'm schizophrenic. When I was in the hospital I was allowed my phone and pretty much everything but they had to charge them for me. I was even allowed my phone during the night. Some peoples rooms where also kinda like their bedrooms at home, it was weird but kinda nice. It's sad how I hear of REALLY bad experiences with hospitals.   If they're in the gym then they're not advocating being overweight, they're trying to LOSE weight, duh. And I'm pretty sure no heroin addict would advocate anyone to use heroin.   What? Obesity won't cause lymphedema. It's either genetic (I think) or caused by cancer/cancer treatments.   Lymphedema isn't an "excuse", it's a reason why someone might look overweight.   I think everyone gets paranoid at some point and then you have people with paranoid personality types and stuff. You're definitely not the only one that gets paranoid. I'm paranoid pretty much every day but it's just not strong enough to cause any delusion.   I'm more scared of everclear than opiates.   "I need about... tree fiddy".   Aren't some of the guys on this team from Arkane (the people who developed Dishonored)? Would explain why It feels kinda like dishonored.   DAMN THAT WAS LIKE FAMOUS IN 2006.   I thought he had a pinched nerve due to his scoliosis and that caused his stomach to basically produce too much acid and causing pain? And that the doctors found this out later on just before he died? Or am I wrong or half right/wrong? Even if he didn't have something wrong with his stomach, he definitely had some mental and other physical issues.    Oh, this is what you meant lol... This shit happens to me all the time, It's basically dissociation in a way I think but it feels super weird when there's a lot of people around because it feels like I'm standing there and everyone else is zooming by.   [I think...](http://i.imgur.com/YLdZhZv.jpg)   Humans are also animals. So do you not befriend humans either? Sad.   I'm actually the opposite. I'm intolerant to heat and I'm sweaty and hot during the cold.  	104
    I was scrolling and scrolling, looking for someone to have posted Anchorman. I almost thought it may have not been posted. Thank goodness you had the good sense to post it!  "60% of the time, it works every time."   Haha! I love the "animals doing funny things" type videos. This one is a favorite of mine...   https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=ExukCRD7gN0   I think that was my favorite part, too.    Hahaha... Why do I have so many down votes? This wasn't a negative comment.  I was basically saying that I wish this was the first image I saw on Reddit. It is hilarious.    I just immediately opened this link in Safari and saved the image so I could share it with like 17 different people(ok, maybe 3 people). Can I just delete my Reddit account and open a new one so that I can tell everyone a year from now that this was the image that brought me to Reddit? This is probably my favorite thing I have seen on here, so far.   Yep, Southern California here as well. I bet they were more afraid that there was water falling from the sky.   http://media2.giphy.com/media/NPyHgTkMStCXC/giphy.gif   Maybe 3rd nipple?      I take the same medici... Oh hey, look, a bike.   He must have given away all of his spoons... Because clearly he doesn't give a fork!        "I guess I shall allow a picture after my primping, you puny human. However, you will not be granted my gaze into the camera."   Oh my God... Thank you. I can't handle when people do this. A little piece of me dies when someone I love says "seen this" without something like "have you" preceding it.   Your mother's behavior sounds extremely erratic. I really think that maybe your dad should push seeing a psychologist or something along those lines. If she has never been like this before, yet all of the sudden is so mean and unsupportive, there could be some much deeper issues going on. I am in NO WAY condoning her behavior. It makes me sick to think that a mother could be that demeaning and evil towards her own child and their spouse. I just think that maybe she could have developed some mental issues that need to be handled by a professional. However, I highly suggest that you have your Dad push the issue of seeing a professional. Until she can control her ludicrous behavior, I that you and your wife should cut off all contact from her.   I have done both. Should such occasion arise that I am in need of nail polish remover, I would find a nail salon. A polish change is only about $5.   Doesn't she grab the purse to hit the dude with it?  	17

Not your average hand gun...                                       Thanks -- updated                           If you happen to live in a state that collects a container deposit surcharge when you purchase anything that comes in a can or bottle, you can collect these to earn a bit of extra money. It's the same concept of as recycling the cans and bottles for money, but the container surcharge makes it more profitable. Most states collect a deposit of 5 cents while Michigan collects a deposit of 10 cents. Here are the 11 states that currently pay you when you return bottles and cans to the store:  California - $0.05  Connecticut - $0.05  ~~Delaware - $0.05~~  Hawaii - $0.05  Iowa - $0.05  Maine - $0.05  Massachusetts - $0.05  Michigan - $0.10  New York - $0.05  Oregon - $0.05  Vermont - $0.05  While this won't make you a ton of money, it's an easy way to make a bit of money quickly, especially if there is a large event in your area where lots of bottles and cans will be left behind.         Do you live in a city that has a Goodwill Outlet in it? (not a regular Goodwill store -- an outlet store). If you do, you should be able to make quite a bit more than that (although you will need to have a small amount to get started -- $20 - $50) -- getting the goods isn't online, but you would be selling them on eBay, so it really is work at home work.                  If you need to find a good place to buy things to resell, you need to find the closest Goodwill Outlet Store -- these aren't regular Goodwill stores. These are deeply discounted stores where they usually sell stuff by the pound. It's dirty and you will need to sort through a lot of junk, but you should be able to turn $100 into $500 - $1000 after expenses by reselling stuff on Craigslist and eBay. If you ever wondered where the professional flea market sellers get all the things they sell, it's at the Goodwill Outlet stores.  If you're in college, forget a summer job -- learn this art and you'll make a lot more over the summer, plus you can do it part-time while at school as well (on your own hours).   Be very careful -- there are very few things where you can make money without spending time at it.  A big step you need to take is to begin looking for a new job if you hate it. You obviously don't want to quit if you need the money, but that doesn't stop you from looking for something else that pays the same or more that you would enjoy more. That seems like a bigger issue than finding a side income.  If you want to transition a side income job to replace your current income, you'll need to spend time on it. There is no way around that. What you probably need to do is create a list of things you like to do so you can get some idea of what type of side income you'd like to try and create.    I think the first question you need to ask is "what do you want to do?" There are plenty of side incomes which can be created. it's also important to know how much you need to make from it. Again, this is why creating a side income before you need it is important because many take some time and effort before you begin to make money from them.  To avoid scams, always research before you give any money. The internet is your friend when it comes to weeding out scams. If there is any pressure that you must spend money now or lose out on teh opportunity, it's a scam...                                    Photo comes from [this article](http://www.poconorecord.com/article/20150716/NEWS/150719569)      This comes from an [article](http://www.poconorecord.com/article/20150716/NEWS/150719569) about the Delaware Water Gap National Recreation Area which is part of the national park system. I have been seeing more and more graffiti like this in national parks lately, and it's both infuriating and sad.   Edit: for those who do enjoy national parks, please consider subscribing to r/NationalPark            I don't know how many times my side incomes have saved me when the unexpected have happened. Creating a way to make money outside your regular income is a lot like a mini insurance policy. If something unexpected happens to your main income, you have another way to earn money right away. it may not be enough to replace your regular income, but it's a hell of a lot better than having zero income coming in. It gives you more time to find a regular job, or it can even become one sometimes. Even if you don't need a side income, it never hurts to create on as an insurance policy.                                                                             	108

On April 8, 2015, the Secretary of State completed that review and recommended to the President that Cuba no longer be designated as a State Sponsor of Terrorism.  -  Accordingly, on April 14, the President submitted to Congress the statutorily required report indicating the Administrations intent to rescind Cubas State Sponsor of Terrorism designation, including the certification that Cuba has not provided any support for international terrorism during the previous six-months; and that Cuba has provided assurances that it will not support acts of international terrorism in the future. The 45-day Congressional pre-notification period has expired, and the Secretary of State has made the final decision to rescind Cubas designation as a State Sponsor of Terrorism, effective today, May 29, 2015.  -  The rescission of Cubas designation as a State Sponsor of Terrorism reflects our assessment that Cuba meets the statutory criteria for rescission. While the United States has significant concerns and disagreements with a wide range of Cubas policies and actions, these fall outside the criteria relevant to the rescission of a State Sponsor of Terrorism designation  Source: http://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/2015/05/242986.htm       This footage was originally published by Turkish media outlet Cumhuriyet.

His encounters take him across the country, from the teeming capital of Tehran, to the centre of Ancient Persia in Esfahan, and finally to the home of his ancestors Iran's holiest city, Mashhad. In each place we meet his friends and relatives who help form a more representative view of Iranians than we often see in the West. It is the story of one young man's experience, but it speaks volumes to all those who desire to know the place better, both westerners and Iranians living abroad. We see Iran through the narrator's eyes, that understands both Iranian and American sensibilities.

The infant mortality rate for triplets (55.31) was 10 times, and the rate for quadruplets (115.02) was 21 times, the rate for single births.

 Sweet, tangy or spicy? They had all three.    Blue Door Smokehouse in Lexington, KY.    Potato salad.       I know my fish monger well and told him that we were making sushi. Before preparing the fish I always place it in the freezer for at least 15 minutes to kill any parasites.    My local fish monger does a great job. Since  I'm not on the west coast I'm pretty sure that it was flash frozen at one point, but I'm not sure.    They're a tartare mixture, one with tuna the other with salmon. They have a little fish roe, Japanese mayo and some crunchy tempura bits. We would have added some scallions if we'd had any. The only reason they're not sitting on rice is because we ran out.       I can't believe I just watched the whole thing, but that was a great video.  Thanks!   I'm not planning to upgrade the portrait lens at this point. The results from that, little inexpensive lens are astounding.  Really I'm looking for a telephoto lens and potentially a wide angle.   The biggest thing that I'm lacking is zoom.

 12VPN or PandaPow   I'm not quite sure how this constitutes "self-awareness" since the robots were responding to pre-programmed conditions ("attempt speech", "listen to oneself", "process speech", "take appropriate action")?       I gave up on Astrill long ago    They won't be able to solve it in all cities but they will in the cities that matter - Beijing, Shanghai, etc. Hebei, Shandong, Jilin etc are not a priority--too poor. Smog used to be terrible in LA but the gov managed to clean it up.    Python has more libs. Ruby is more fun.    Thank you, and your volunteers, for your selfless giving.  Are you primarily funded through individual donors, or institutional/corporate donations? How much does fundraising take away from the clinic work and how do you resolve that issue?   No "a" either :)   Sounds like you need a new bank and insurer   It's incremental innovation, which is not the same as breaking new ground, but useful nonetheless.  Wechat started out copying whatsapp, but it's now arguably miles ahead, especially with micropayments    Stick deodorant literally does not exist in China, even in Beijing.    Your nexus will be fine. Just use VPN for Google Play and other services. I recommend 12VPN over Astrill.  Oh, and get Pleco as your dictionary app.    I second that last comment.   China can be a great experience with a positive attitude; most of all, the people are very nice - especially in the northeast where you are going. Gruff on the surface but great friends once you get to know them. Take every opportunity to mingle and spend time with people.  Also, be on guard that employers  will try to use you, so don't be afraid to politely stand firm when you feel it's necessary.    - I disagree about the driving, at least here in Beijing. In small rural towns though, yeah anything goes.  - in my experience, internet speeds are generally good with a VPN, though it does slow down sometimes    Sorry, but you'll have to rephrase the question.    Ah, the English...   I agree about "2 China's ". But both are the "real" China - one old, one new.    Ignore the negative reddishit; if you come with a positive attitude and a true desire to educate as well as learn yourself, you'll do great. Rural China might be tougher than you expect in terms of living conditions. I would start in the city.    ^this. Be prepared for a lot of bureaucratic BS and lack of organization and communication and morals (judging by western standards). If you can roll with that and not let it get to you, you'll be fine.    +1 for Yunnan if you're going 2-3 tier.     Your part 1 will no longer work in Beijing. They've cracked down on that    Many, many English language schools in China hire non-native speakers, especially if they are Caucasian.

Ella pago 200 al local ese y termin con lo que termin.    Por tu comment veo que hay ms gente con esa mentalidad de la que pensaba.   Si, ya s que si quera agarrar el laburo le tena que recordar eso, pero la verdad ya a esta altura me embola andar pensando por el resto de la gente, prefer que se jodiese sola por rata y boluda.   Labur un tiempo en un estudio de fotografa del cual me termin yendo porque eran muy, muy ratas.    La duea saba que yo arreglaba PCs adems de sacar fotos, porque figura en mi CV, entonces un da me llama para arreglar 3 PCs del estudio. Voy, y tenan instalado cualquier SO (esos Windows Titanium o Gladiatus o no se cmo mierda se llaman), todos los soft de edicin crackeados como el orto, 20 mil toolbars, etc etc.   Estuve un da entero poniendole las 3 PCs a punto y mientras ella me contaba que las haba mandado a hacer y a arreglar a un local de por ac, que le haban cobrado cualquier cosa siempre, que la haban re cagado porque las PCs andaban mal, etc etc etc. Se las dej andando 10/10, un SO como la gente, estable, todo bien crackeado, le hice particiones en los discos, nada del otro mundo pero se las dej bien. La mina me escribi a la semana para decirme que estaba feliz con el laburo, que era la primera vez que alguien no la haba cagado con las PCs, todo muy copado.    Fast forward 2 meses a hace una semana, me enva "cunto me cobrs por instalarme el Lightroom y el Photoshop en una PC nueva?", le contesto que si son slo esos dos programas le cobro $300. Me contesta "Ah, en [Nombre del local donde la cagaron] me cobran $200" a lo cual le contesto "Bueno, fijate y avisame". Qu hace la mina? Va y lo lleva a ese local. Una vez ms le instalan todo como el orto, le hacen pija la PC con virus, y entre idas y vueltas se termina quemando 500 mangos. Me manda ahora un mensaje diciendome si puedo ir a arreglarle la PC... A lo que le contest que no tengo tiempo porque estoy ocupadsimo. No voy a moverme de nuevo y a arreglar cagadas, que se joda por rata, por boluda, y por no poner $100 ms desde un principio sabiendo que el laburo se lo haca bien.    Hay gente muy pelotuda.   We definitely need vargas in this thread.       That is just what happens in movies.  To add my two cents, a fact that they always insist on getting wrong in the movies is the use of a defibrillator. They show it as a way to resuscitate someone's stopped heart but that's not it's function at all; desfibrillators are used to return a dysrhythmia (ventricular fibrillation to be precise) to normal sinus rythm, not to restart a heart.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcJFdCmN98s   "Back to drinking vodka and filming weird shit with our dashcams then" - That Country   $70k   Time is definitely a dimension in our universe. We invented a way to measure it just as we invented ways to measure space, like counting in in meters, miles, or light years. We invented seconds, minutes, years etc for measuring time, but we know for a fact it's there as a dimension because of Relativity and time dilation effects at different speeds or gravity.   The only thing that bothers me is when the language is super mispronounced in characters that should speak it fluently. Quick example, Breaking Bad is one of the best series I've ever seen, but as a native Spanish speaker it really bothered me how Gus Fring spoke that language given that it was a chilean born and raised character. Maybe he's referring to something like this? I don't understand any other language other than English in that movie so I wouldn't know   Right on point. If you break a limb, better be an arm. Walking with a broken leg for months is a fucking pain in the ass. But if you ever lose a limb, better be a leg. Amazing prosthetics for legs, not so much for arms (there are awesome prosthetics for them but given the use we give to hands they just don't accomplish the same level of utility).

He raps   Just to contribute with my two cents; OP, maybe you've heard that information in the universe can't spread faster than the speed of light (that would violate some pretty essential bases of Relativity). If we were to obscure light sources such as in your example and see them instantly 100 million light years away, we could communicate and therefore transmit information instantly, which is infinitely faster than the speed of light! It would be awesome but alas, it can't happen on this particular Universe :(   Dx   Yeah.

 I finished **The Martian, by Andy Weir** which I thought was really good, but some aspects dragged on throughout the book. (The fact that is was originally a serial is apparent)  I just started the first of the Mistborn series **The Final Empire, by Brandon Sanderson**, since I'd seen it recommended so much on Reddit, and this is shaping up to being one compelling read. The only off putting thing was trying to get started as it throws the reader into the thick of it without defining some of the terms such as "skaa".   Well, the library used to be a giant fiction section that was sorted by the first three letters of the author's last name. (ie. James Patterson would be in FIC PAT)   The reason I am asking is that my mother is an elementary media specialist and I was curious as to what you all thought about libraries doing that.  This also raised some question as to where certain books go as there was some question as to whether or not to split SciFi and Fantasy since SciFi is, for the most part, futuristic fantasy.    #   Quoting from a MyAnimeList thread about it:   By order of release date:  Tenchi Muyo! Ryo-Ohki  Tenchi Muyo! Mihoshi Special  Tenchi Universe  Tenchi in Tokyo  Tenchi Muyo! GXP  The first two are ova's (Original video animation) if you want you could just start at Tenchi Universe and you'll be fine.  As for where to watch it, I think Funimation has the license to the series but I don't know if they have it on their website.   Did anyone else catch that Zen was reading in the wrong direction? The book Shirayuki left is, based on the cover, meant to be read from left to right. Thing is, Zen was flipping the pages going towards the cover. (Books in Japan are right to left rather than L-R)   It is a mess. It was good for about wo years and then the leadership changed. They took what used to be a fun club where people would poke fun at the characters and situations to a club where you cannot talk or do anything fun.  I found that the university has more people who watch anime than go to the club and they are more fun to hang out with.   Similar to the experiences shared within, the club seems to be getting creepier and creepier each year. (Thankfully it hasn't gotten to the stage of people bringing in dakimakuras and what not)   It is kinda funny, it is almost like people in the class knew that the class rep was an alien as they call her "the iron lady" and the truth of the matter is that she is controlling a metal shell.   Well they are weird, if you look into it. They not only do video games but they are also a book publisher as well in Japan. (Well, they publish manga but still.) [Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square_Enix#Other_media), look at the second paragraph.   I know this is a month old, but I finally got around to reading *The Martian* over the course of two days it was really good and thank you for the recommendation! I haven't gotten to the others yet, but I will.   No, he did twenty (20).   One of the higher up executives also mentioned it by name during SE's E3 press conference so that was pretty cool to see.   [Here](https://web.archive.org/web/20141021201922/http://8ths.in/fantranslation-guide/) is one from 8thSin Translations who was known for reviewing various fansubs for their translations, typesetting, readibility and what not. Sadly the site is down but the Wayback Machine has a copy of it with the example images.   [Here](http://i.imgur.com/bnJHheR.jpg) is the page that the above image is from. Don't ask...   SHAME ---   It is the process of using a soldering iron (ie. A device that gets extremely hot) and melting solder (a thin piece of metal with a lower melting point) in order to make, or fix, a permanent connection.   You can find the iron and solder in stores like RadioShack. (If they are still around in your area)   Well, that is what it is in the English release.   I think it is when you create/cause a play to occur resulting in a goal. (ex. You angle the ball off a wall and a teammate then sends the ball into the goal)   I'd like to see a "Buzzer Beater" bonus that gives extra xp for scoring a goal after the clock gets to 0:00.   The reason for this is that it is rare enough to warrant recognition but it would need to be enough xp to be nice but not force people to wait until the last literal second.    Bonuses as in things such as "Save", "Shot on Goal", "Playmaker", and such.   The video, mainly, features this [fanart.](https://i.imgur.com/kF1knni.jpg)   Bells? Could I trade you a bug for some? ^^^\(Wait, ^^^wrong ^^^game...)   Well, Evangelion has been mentioned by name in western cinema before back in the movie, "One Hour Photo". [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5FmFaK7pMU) is the scene in question.  Granted, having them move and fight would be more than a single scene where they show an action figure of one of the mechs.   What about an option for both?   If you are a college student, or have access to a .edu email, you can get Prime for $49 a year instead of the $99 price.   Yeah, I believe that him turning around in mid-air like that is intentional given his prior experience.   I agree that Rocket League is really watchable as, over the past week it has been out, I have been watching a lot of it on Twitch and I'm someone who almost never watches stuff on Twitch.  Since you mentioned Krovovi, [here is a montage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kI1xuE6OUuU) of his plays from the second beta of Rocket League. The reason that he is so good at RL is that he played a lot of Supersonic Acrobatic Rocket-Powered Battle-Cars back on the PS3.   You drive as fast going backwards as going forwards, couple this with some double jump backflips and you can move pretty quickly from midfield. The only thing you don't have is the ability to boost.   There is a tutorial, all the way up to All-Star difficulty of solely aerial kicks/hits. (Along with striker and goalie training)      Yep, on a number of occasions I've had to demolish the goalie in order for my team to score. Unlike some others, it seems to be quite effective and after a few times they just give up.   This one is harder in the west as there isn't a legal source to get it as of July 12, 2015. People would have to pirate it to watch it. I wish CR would pick it up, but odds are that won't happen.   Yep, of sorts. Japanese has three scripts:  * Hiragana -  (Used for simple sentences, as hints/helpers for reading kanji in some publications, and as particles)  * Katakana -  (Mainly used for foreign words.  = America)  * Kanji - (These are, basically, Chinese characters and they are the more difficult part of the language. To read proficiently, you'd need to know 2000+ characters)   I wasn't trying to insinuate that ball cam was better than the normal view, but that changing the camera angle from -5 to -10 helped a lot.   To summarize, by doing do I'm able to:  * See the positioning of the car while the ball is above me  * I tend to hit the ball more than with the angle at -5 while in ball cam  * Playing a few rounds with it online I have done quite well.   It was back in May of 2014 and it was coinciding with the release of the third movie. (Rebellion)   I think that Sega will, some day, turn to only doing mobile and arcade games. The arcade is still popular in Japan and Sega has their own [chain](https://i.imgur.com/Nw8CrNT.jpg) of [them](https://i.imgur.com/C6JjwIR.jpg) while smartphones and mobile games are popular not only there but around the world.  Photo Source: First one is of the Akihabara locations while the second is the one near Tokyo Dome City. (I took them both while I was over there)   I was playing earlier today and I decided to fiddle with the camera settings to see if I could improve the view while playing in ball mode.   I found, so far, that leaving everything default but changing the angle from -5 to -10 vastly improved my play and it was easier to line up shots. What this does is make it so that the camera, even on kickoff with the ball all the way up in the air, shows the back of the car which give you the position and orientation of the car compared to the ball. While it, slightly, limits the view on the normal camera mode it isn't drastic enough to change back to the old setting.   For some anecdotal evidence,  I took this online in 3v3s, and we were able to go 8-0 with myself getting 4 goals. I do not consider myself to be that good of a player, but I have noticed an improvement. Whether this is consistent is left to further testing.   Try listening to the soundtrack now, it will hurt. It will hurt in a few months as well.   Thankfully, unlike **a certain** series, their powers are imperfect. (can't choose when to stop, can only use it for 5 seconds at a time, etc...)   Amazon.co.jp would also work for imports and they do have an toggle-able English interface.    Yep, I said, "...would change the setting so it is a held option."   I know in SARPBC the ball cam was a held, rather than toggle-able, option so I imagine those who are really good at it now who used to play the original would change the setting so it is a held option.   Odds are, they use it as a situational view rather than always having it on.   I feel like this is closer to people using the ball cam view when the ball is above them.   Odds are, this was taken after 1AM on Zalarea. The server tends to die out for the night as people on the East coast go to bed.   What would be even funnier is if the VA of Nashetania was allergic to carrots much like Mel Blanc. (The voice of Bugs Bunny and he was, ironically, allergic to carrots.)   What would be their version of the Roadrunner? Nichijou?   Actual ramen is quite good, and there are a number of varieties out there as well.   Thing is, the lossless streaming is unnoticeable unless you have the top of the line headphones and DACs.  I, personally, have the Sennheiser HD650's and the AudioEngineD1 DAC and I cannot tell the difference between MP3s at 320kbps or the 1000kb+ FLACs I have.   If you want to be in people's good graces, click on the enemies like that one and type: /sh  lt;t is at  lt;pos!   What this does is shout (ie. Map-wide message) that  lt;t (aka. Your target) is at  lt;pos (your current position). The reason this helps is that people who are at higher levels, or even endgame, need/want them to get seals which are used for endgame gear.   Rather than delete the VM, set it up and create an image of said VM then just reinstall it.   It is from an anime-inspired series created by the guys who did "Red vs. Blue" called "R W B Y"   I remember from some of the earlier digital fan subs of series wherein they would ask people to stop distributing it should it be licensed in the US. I guess that is a tradition that came over from the VHS era.   Either that or someone, like myself, who likes to watch, "How Its Made".   130k does diddily squat around the DC area as the cost of living is insane. (Rent for a condo starting at $1250 a month)   Someone was translating it and they were going at a good pace, but real life caught up them and they had to abandon the project.   I think all August games are doomed to be dropped and never fully translated. (Yoake Mae has been sitting at 100% TL'd for months, Fortune Arterial's last update was in 2013, Aiyoku no Eustia died when Yandere Translations fell off the face of the Earth)    Possible shows:  * http://myanimelist.net/anime/6166/Asobi_ni_Iku_yo! (No blue haired main character, but alien takes refuge with friends)  * http://myanimelist.net/anime/8557/Shinryaku!_Ika_Musume  * http://myanimelist.net/anime/9379/Denpa_Onna_to_Seishun_Otoko (Maybe an alien?) - This is probably it.  * http://myanimelist.net/anime/10578/C%C2%B3   Neither does the Realta Nua version of F/SN.   That is crazy considering that TypeMoon allowed Fate/Unlimited Codes and Fate/Extra to be released in the US. While they are spin-offs, it is still in the F/__ universe.   Tell him to come back for the last 6 minutes!   If you listen, you can hear the wind rustling during some of the scenes prior to the reveal.   Trust me, this is one of the first shows that take a SoL show and turn it on the audience's expectations.   No problem! It was the first one that came to find when you described it.   Clannad and Clannad ~After Story~ for sure. (Please be aware that Clannad is slow to start but it will definitely cause him to think about his life.)    You are thinking of "[The Girl Who Leapt Through Space](http://myanimelist.net/anime/5307/Sora_wo_Kakeru_Shoujo)".   Think about it, earthbenders could outright break any bone in the body as they are made up of, mainly, calcium and carbon!   It is one of the randomly selected phrases when they return from a venture.   Virus is the one of the few times I can see a macro in a PUG. (I'm fine with funny macros if it is with FC members and friends)   You also might want to spell correctly; as doing so will create a better impression of you to the reader. Punctuation might help as well.   It takes time and money to make games, or anything for that matter. Most of the free games, whether or not they are on Steam, are passion projects and something the developer did in their spare time. (a la Cave Story or [Narcissu](http://store.steampowered.com/app/264380/)) Some free games are made to purposefully grow a community such as Trackmania: Nations. (It used to be completely F2P, but an update limited the time that people could play for free before having to sit out a round.)   Force a random person to have to make a choice between two horrible options at random times to watch the ensuing chaos.    Thanks. As for the multiplayer, it is the same population as there is cross platform multiplayer.   It is like that because they way the room is, the A/C and heating unit is blocking easy access to moving my chair. The TV itself is up on a dresser and a ways in because I have to fit my PS4 up there as well and I don't want it to fall off.  [Here](http://i.imgur.com/ex2bvzZ.png) is a hastily drawn and labeled layout of my dorm room. The blank hallway is where the entrance is. While I could move the chair back, the viewing angle suck as the dresser and desk combination limits it.   I was asking because when I am away at college, my PS4 is hooked up to a small TV as my dorm room doesn't have that much space, but in order to see it I'd have to be 8-10 feet away from the screen. Due to that, I barely touch my PS4 during the school year.  I was, basically, wondering whether or not people felt as though it was worthwhile for me to get it on the PC as well due to that fact. (If I'm on my laptop, I am a lot closer to the screen.)   **Please read before commenting.**  I am debating on whether or not to get Rocket League on PC.I own a PS4 and I do have PS+, but when I am away at college I barely touch my console as it is easier to play on the PC. (17in laptop vs A 19in TV from 8-10 feet away)  As such, I am debating on whether or not to get Rocket League on the PC. I played quite a bit of SARPBC back on the PS3 so I'd definitely get the PS4 version, regardless, since it is part of PS+.   **Please read before commenting as this is slightly different.**  I am debating on whether or not to get Rocket League on PC.I own a PS4 and I do have PS+, but when I am away at college I barely touch my console as it is easier to play on the PC.

Heavensward isn't like other MMO expansions where people could jump into the new content instantly.  In HW, you have to complete the main story quest all the way through the 2.55 update of content. It will take you anywhere from 70-150 hours to complete this content. [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/3bheg1/guide_to_catching_up_to_patch_30_heavensward/) is a good, spoiler free, guide as to what you have and can do to catch up to where heavensward begins.  Do not worry about your friends being at the endgame level right now as you'd catch up soon enough. That and they'd still get a good amount of exp from helping you progress through the required dungeons and what not.   ~~Do you happen to know where I could buy the piano arrange album? (It isn't on the US iTunes like the rest of Key's stuff, same with the Million Star single album)~~  Dang it, it seems as though the album was only as a bonus for the first press of the Angel Beats VN. Here's to hoping that Sekai will license and release the game and include the album.   Be aware that Eden of the East has some references to a male's genitals in the first episode and such. (While it is a great show, this may be a deal breaker for you until she is older.)  As for the source for these shows, look on Funimation or Crunchyroll. While a lot of people do pirate anime, it is not advisable to publicly discuss it.  (I **will** remove any and all references to illegal downloading and streaming sites. Sorry, but I have to do it as a moderator.)   /r/hailcorporate   Well, if you set Lisma Lominsa as your free location (if you use the one-time password system on the PC) it is worth it in order to get over to Horizon quickly.   On some servers it is easy to make gil while others, such as Zalarea, have had their markets crash over the past few months. (IV materia is going for ~3-7k gil)   You can cancel the animation by doing another skill. (This is where off-GCD skills come into play)   Yep. You'll find out later who and why they did what they did there in the OP.   Rather than teleport to Horizon, TP to Lisma Lominsa Lower Decks and take the aethernet shard to the Archanist's Guild, from there go west and take the ferry. It might be cheaper than directly teleporting.   The Japanese, when transliterated from the hiragana is, "nya nya nyan nyan". You might recognize "nyan" because of "Nyan Cat" which was popular a few years ago. Also, "nya/nyan" is their version of a cat meowing.  /u/smokeshack typed the hiragana wrong as you have to hit "n" twice to write "" which is "n" in Japanese. The reason for this is that there are characters with "a,i,u,e,o" after an "n". ( ,  ,  , , respectively)   Yeah, that is me. I decided to forgo my old username as I am getting older. (Heck, I'm 21 now)   Yep. The go off of the base class, not the job. (This is why you see it as getting Warrior exp while playing PLD and so on.)   100k for a professionally produced song isn't much. Heck, I've got a crappily recorded video of using a PSP as a PS3 controller that has over 300k views.   It is sad that a, at the time, 14 year-old's video would have more views than a one hit wonder music artist.   That was from a level 55 MSQ. (I know it since I just saw it)   The, kupo.   Thank you for doing these! I've downloaded a number of them but 99% of the time my phone is on vibrate. :(  Would it be possible for you to do the [OP for Clannad](https://youtu.be/Q2HmP6Sl5RQ)?   The only thing was the Sekai allowed the group who is looking into localizing MuvLuv a little bit of time during SP's Anime Expo panel to announce it and give a few more details.   The ??? is Anime Planet.   Yeah, it does seem a bit off. I think the fact that the episode is broken out into skits rather than being combined together in a more seamless manner is causing it. It stems from the source as Working is a 4-koma manga rather than a continuous format. This means that the situations and characters are expressed within something akin to a comic strip which creates a natural pause for the reader.  I believe that the original director had a better grasp on how to alleviate the skit-esque feeling when adapting the previous two seasons of Working.   Look at the third chapter, that is where I noticed the gore ramping up.   How about this? Scrap WM, and make it so that BRD players can choose whether or not to cast it.   Have it so a tap, or click, of the skill does the normal skill but holding the skill causes it to cast with a 25% damage bonus. This would create more of a skill based system and it would allow the freedom and flexibility without being clunky.  (This has a basis in reality as archers could either fire fast for effect or line up their shot, thereby taking longer, for increased damage)    Thing is, back then, cutscenes were not rendered in game but as a video. (ie. Squaresoft made a video with the characters and then had the game call said video at that point in time.)   I know, haven't they heard the news? They're an amazon showroom now. (Though they will now match the price if amazon sells it.)   It seemed like this month's video was a bit more off the cuff rather than the usual, thought out, monthly video which lent itself to it not feeling "right". Odds are this is due to them prepping for the upcoming conventions with Anime Expo in California and Otacon in Maryland.   I'm not the guy who made the original, but [here is a much larger version of the image](http://i.imgur.com/5OcatP9.jpg). You could use this as a wallpaper.  I ran the original through the Waifu2x-caffe program and had it scale the image to 4x the original size. (This looks a lot better than other resizing algorithms as it is actually recreating the original image through the training of a neural network based on line art and things of that nature.)   Dang it, now I can't see anything else.   I wish they had added that the PS3 startup sound is actually that of an [orchestra tuning.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfSH1ezevjM)   Actually, the camera isn't used when using the gamepad to allow Wii games. There is an IR LED on each side of the camera which creates the sensor bar for the wiimote. (This is also why you can use two candles spaced away from each other since a flame produces infrared light)    I am not affiliated with Random Curiosity, but I used to use the site before finding out about reddit. I still go back every season to read the previews as it has been the best way, that I have found, to find out more about the upcoming shows as they give their thoughts and compile all known promotional videos together.      We need the salt, there are too many times where this would be perfect.   They toned down the manga's artstyle, as the chins and faces are really pointy in the manga.   Have people race the same track multiple times and give the replays to the person compiling them into a video. Trackmania has the ability to display thousands of replays at a single time with custom camera angles and everything.   Could you please mark that as spoilers as the trailer nor the promotional art say anything in that regard?   This is stupid, I get doing so if the apps were calling for people to go out and do horrible deeds, but to completely remove apps where it is used in a historical context is getting to the point of whitewashing history and it could stand for more ramifications in the long run.

The first is for **Amazon Student**, which is Prime geared towards college students.   ---  **What is Amazon Student?**  It is basically Amazon Prime, but for college students. Also, rather than costing $99 a year, it is $49 and has all of the benefits. You can get a six month free trial without the streaming video, music and the kindle lending library.  **What do I need to be able to sign up for Amazon student?**  You need a .edu email address and you must give your school (college/university) along with your year and intended date of graduation (Month/Year).    **What if I am not a student?**  This is the second program for **regular people** where if people use your link to sign up, you earn a $5 credit for each person. This would be great to share with an audience that could benefit from having Amazon Prime. They can get a 30-day trial for free.  **What are the benefits of Amazon Prime?**  * Free 2 day shipping on **any** Amazon fulfilled order. * Free release date shipping on video games and others. (*Only through Amazon Student*) * Instant streaming of movies and TV shows. (Only available when you pay for it. Not on the trial.) * Streaming music through Amazon Music. * You can borrow one book a month for the Kindle. * Unlimited photo storage on Amazon Cloud Services (Photography businesses cannot use this)  **How is this related to /r/digitalmarketing?** --- Right now, each person you refer nets you credit on Amazon that is similar to a gift card.

(Think forums for parents, or other places in which people would be susceptible to sign up for Amazon Prime.)     I agree that it can be annoying, but there are ways about doing it in which it isn't in your face so much.  The last time I posted about this program was three years ago.   Yeah, but even affiliate marketing can become a source of beermoney if done in smaller quantities; which referring Prime could lend itself to as you cannot put your credits in the bank.   I checked the rules and such to see if it wasn't allowed, but I didn't see anything.       Japanese has katakana which is, mainly, used to denote foreign words and provide a phonetic basis to the words. For example, cake in Japanese is  (Ke i ki) and another example is America in Japanese is  (A me ri ka). They do not have a "C" so "K"'is used instead. I believe that some, or most, of the names of items and such are written in katakana and then phonetically translated into English.  EDIT: Fixed the katakana for cake. Thanks /u/zhv.   It won't be on the ancient version of Android for much longer as someone is looking at bringing Android 4.4, through Cyanogenmod 11, to the NST.

No e-ink readers have a backlight. The ones that have lights do so from the side and on top of the e-ink layer.   OP could also just root their NST and install the google play books app since the NST is, basically, an android tablet.   It is great on the PC due to no ads a d the higher quality streaming.   Sadly it has only been translated into Spanish and there are 18 chapters available in that language on the usual site.   The light novels are available in English from your local bookstore or online. Season 1 covered volumes one and two while season two covered volumes three and five.  They are really good reads and they go well beyond what the anime showed us.   Considering that it wasn't leaked at all, my guess is that he was the only one who had access to it. (Loose lips sink ships sort of deal.)   Who knows, the vita might even be able to run Gamecube games. They've been able to get it running on Android tablets so who knows?   3.0 does as well, some of the side quests' names over in Falcon's Nest are still in Japanese. I've also gotten the programming name of an item while doing a story quest in the game place. (ie, it was something like: "iname ____ :  ______" where the first blank was something in katakana, too quick for me to read it, and the second blank was more information.   Good grief.  	129
 r/creativewriting hope I typed it out right. It's around 2'500 people subscribed there, but I think it's a good place to share with others and get some feedback. Cheers!   I like this, but I think I would like this even better on a different subreddit. It sounds to like an epic tale about a crime fighting cat is about to begin, and that very fact is quite awesome indeed, but I would find, personally, that this would be more well received on a different subreddit, friend. Just letting you know ;]    Every night I hear something howling outside my window, but I guess it would be better described as a wail. It starts off booming and loud until it shatters into high-pitched screeches, kinda like fingernails on a chalk board. It scared me every single night before I went to bed. After much debate, I decided to go outside and find out exactly what this awful sound originated from. With only a flash night and a couple batteries, I descended into the dark forest.  I'd say it was about thirty minutes of hiking aimlessly before I heard it, the booming wail.  It was loud, indicating that it, whatever it was, was near. I, now hearing it from this close, did not want to stick around in order to find out exactly what it was. I ran. The bushes and twigs I made my way through snapped and rustled violently, loudly. I ran till I found I had no more air in my lungs. Huffing, I could hear the queasy sound of my breathing. After I was able to breath somewhat normal, I took a look around and found that I was lost. "Shit!" I cried. I was so frustrated that I was lost in the dark scary woods. But in a matter of a second, everything became undyingly terrifying as I heard the sound of bushes from afar rustle. Something was coming, and it was coming quickly. Unfortunately I didn't get to see what it was before this large figure popped out from the bushes and jumped right for me.  Everything went black.   When I first opened my eyes, I found that my vision was fuzzy. Although, I could tell right away where I was, and that would be my bedroom. I was in bed now staring straight at the closet like I normally would every morning. "Was that all just a dream?" I thought. One look in the mirror and I was proven to be wrong. My hair completely rustled unlike the usual morning wake-up do, little pieces of leaves, twigs, and dirt speckled on my shirt and pants, and especially the fact I was wearing a hoodie and jeans of which I wore that night.  This was a very creepy thing to happen to anyone, so that is why I'm here right now telling you this. I thought you might get a kick out of it, hell, maybe even a laugh. I don't know how I got home though, and why I can't remember getting back... Oh well, I'm not dead or anything so I guess I should count myself lucky.  But, there's just this thing getting at me... I've been getting this pretty wicked headache all morning. That's not all, I've had this itch ever since I woke up on the back of my neck. I haven't looked at it yet but I will soon. Everything worked out for the better I suppose.   Lord, as I'm typing this out I can feel that awful taste in my mouth. Jesus, it really does taste awful now that I think about it, ugh. It's just about the worst thing I think I have ever had the pleasure of tasting.   This taste in my mouth, It's not completely unfamiliar though... It's not like anything I've ever tasted before but... How can I describe it?  It tastes kind of...  Meaty.      It's nice to meet you sir!   I'm honestly confused as to why your comment is downvoted. The picture is indeed hilarious.    Thank you very much. It was a long read so thank you for taking the time to read through it all!   Holy... Shit...   Intense.   wow... Thank you!   I had the worst nightmare. It started out simple, and from there, it took a strange turn. From the get go anyone could tell something was wrong. Hell, I didn't even think nor knew that this was a dream, I just opened my eyes wondering what in gods name I was doing there naked and cuddled up to a tree. Funny enough, it was like I had woken up, as if someone snapped there fingers and there I was, naked and alone. But this was a dream, nothing more.   The first thing that came to my attention was an old building that seemed to resemble a school or a college of some sort. It stood there being the only thing in the endless field of grass that I truly believed to stretch on forever, the only two things accompanying it being me and the tree I snuggled up against. I had this feeling that whatever I had to do, whatever happened, I should not take one step into the building. Though, then came the rain. My naked body started to freeze and shake uncontrollably as each drop felt like being pelted by a rock. It was painful, cold, and the first sign that this was no ordinary circumstance. It became so unbearable that I forced myself over to the building. The dew on the grass in between my toes and on the bottoms of my feet sent a spike of frost bite each step I took. It was so painful. I had no choice, I had to enter the building my consciousness warned me of. The pain was just too much.   I had finally made it to this building and entered through the wooden doors. My body returned to its slightly chilled temperature as I gazed upon the giant entrance way.   The entrance... how does it seem so hard to describe when it's so easy too?   You see, The entrance was huge, but not in the way one would think it to be. It was empty, bare, completely stripped of life. It was big in length and width, though it was enormous in height. All the walls were completely concrete and the only things that stood out were a huge stair case leading up to a door that was the exact same size as the entrance I had just made my way through. Two tiny windows to the left and right of the door, not to far apart from the door itself, looked to touch to the ground on the floor that the door was on. Now, with this environment I stood in painted out for you, Something seemed completely off about this entrance way. It was familiar, but looked different from the image I was trying to picture in my head. To no avail could I remember where this familiarity came from. The entrance way looked as if something was meant for it, but that something never came to fruition, just like the picture in my head. I felt that, as much as this place started to tug at my mind, I shouldn't wait around for nothing.    When my eyes met the ground, I saw clothing. Being naked at the time, it was only natural for me to put on whatever clothing I could find. A perfect fit. What I now had on seemed to be a hospital gown, but I knew for certain I wasn't in a hospital. I didn't let this bother me for long though as I wanted to move on. I felt that I needed to keep moving, and when this feeling came, so did the feeling of someone lingering behind. I turned around and looked all over, yet I could see no one, and there is no way anyone could have hid from me in this bare, completely stripped place. I decided it would be best to head for the door at the top of the stair case.   When making my way up the stairs I heard something humming quietly. As I made my way further up the steps, It got a little louder. It kept building up in volume each step I made, so I ventured a little faster. Though, the more quickly I went, the more quickly the sound dominated the room. At one point it became clear as to what the sound was, and that sound was breathing. It was raspy and forced. This breathing got louder as I made my way up the stairs further and further. I looked behind me and all around but no one was there that I could see. I started to run up the stairs and the breathing got louder at a faster pace, as expected. But when I got closer to the door, the breathing became ear splitting. I nearly fell over when I rushed through the doors. But when I did get through to the other side, the breathing had stopped.  When I took a good look around where I was, I found myself in the hallway of a school. It was dark, and something told me to not go into any of the classrooms. Opposite of the door stood an elevator and two stair cases to the left and right of this elevator. It struck me as odd that there were two staircases, but I didn't question it much. The air was intense and struck this unbelievable feeling of dread coming my way. The silence was, for a lack of a better word, wrong. It was too silent, and that made me think that it was in preparation of something, something bad that is.   *DING*  I jumped. It was the elevator. I looked over and found that the elevator was coming down to the floor I was on. The only thing that really tugged at my curiosity though was that there were no numbers for the floors. I know this sounds strange, but I didn't feel that the dread was coming from the elevator, but that it would come from somewhere else. Then I heard it, a door opening. It came from the entrance hall, if that's what you could call it. I didn't want to go back inside to check who it was, but right then I remembered the two windows that laid low to the floor. I went to look through the one that was onto my left since it was closer to me. I had to lay on my belly in order to look through to the other side, and when I did, I saw the silhouette of a man who looked no older than I did from what I could tell. He walked into the big empty entrance way and stood in the middle of it, something large in his right hand, and something quite small in the other. He just stood there and looked to the floor. Despite the entrance way being quite dark, this mans silhouette was unable to hide itself in that same darkness. He was, in the only way I could explain it to you, blacker than the whole room. I couldn't keep my eyes off of him. I just sat on my belly, wondering and contemplating as to what he was doing there. Then, catching me off guard, was a -     *DING*  I turned around to see if the elevator had made it's way down to my floor. It hadn't. From what I could tell, it was just indicating that it had made its way a floor down. Though, even as a small detail, it struck me as odd how it took longer to make its way down a floor than the usual elevator would. I got up on my feet to investigate the elevator. As I did so, the moment I was about to gain full composure standing up, I instantly felt something very wrong. This itching feeling of being watched by a thousand eyes caught me from right under my feet. I looked to my right down the hall, and in each of the door ways, all the way to the end, was one silhouette peaking out from a classroom. I looked to my left to see the exact same thing. Although, it was only when they opened their eyes that the true terror had struck me. The eyes of each silhouette had been wide, and the whites of the eyes glorified by the small black pupil stained over. They made their way out of the class rooms and walked towards me, never blinking once and keeping their eyes wide with the look of pure and absolute terror. I stumbled back and landed on my ass, screaming. I couldn't think straight, so I ended up slowly trying to escape on my hands and knees. Each slap from my palms and the thuds from my knees on the hard, slippery floor hurt. Tears quietly seeping through the cracks of my eyelids while I tried my best to avoid the looks of the silhouettes was emotionally traumatizing. Go, go, go, was all that played throughout my mind.   And then, the elevator made a ding. It was one floor closer now. Everything, the elevator, the silhouettes, the crawling, had made this the longest minute of my life. The pain I felt now could not even be compared to the pelting rain from before. That rain, as much as it hurt, would have been my haven from this.   *DING*   *DING*  Another ding, and another, each time coming sooner than the last. Something is coming, something is coming, something is coming, over and over in my head. Faster and faster the sound of my palms and the echoing thuds from my knees quickened pace as I tried so hard and desperately to get away. The feeling of hands reaching out towards me pumped me with more fear than I thought possible for anyone to go through. This forced my thirst for survival. I needed to get up, and I needed to do it now. I held my breath in and gained the strength to shoot upwards on my feet. I ran to the door as fast as I could, legs seemingly moving on a will of their own, and opened it. As scared as I was, something stopped me dead in my tracks.   The whole entrance way was on fire.   I couldn't believe it. When my head locked on to some small portion of sanity, I saw him there. The person who had walked into the entrance way, on fire. Now on the floor to his left and right was a gas can and a lighter. I didn't see the lighter since it was so small and hard to make out from where I was, but it was obvious given the circumstances.   Then he did the funniest thing. He looked up at me and spoke in fuzzy distorted voice like a broken TV and said, "I did this all for you."   He then backed away from the middle of the entrance way, and as he did so, a path among the flames emerged. The small separation between the flames was wide enough for me to run through to the entrance, so I ran. I ran fast, furiously with purpose, and made it to the doors that lead beyond the hell I was in.  But before I opened it, I looked back. I saw through the windows that lay low to the left and right of the door up the stairs. behind the glass of each window were the eyes of the silhouettes staring dead straight at me as if they wanted me to come back. That's when I noticed something about them I didn't when I first saw them, it was their skin. It looked as if  each silhouette had cracked skin since you could see tiny slits of pink show through. I was so confused as to what this was. It didn't hit me until I noticed the pain all throughout my body come instantly. I looked at my hands, and they were charcoal and cracked. I felt as if I had been burnt alive. As that thought came, I realized.   They weren't silhouettes, they were burnt people.   Then, complete defining screams wailed throughout the hall. Words were in the midst of the screams too, but they were so incoherent that I couldn't make out anything that was said. Now was the time I needed to leave. It took everything to open the doors, but when I finally did, I was greeted with the most calming sensation. The air was light and easy to breath, the rain that came was misty and refreshing. I looked up into the sky in relief and embraced the peace that was present. And as I stared into the ever calming sky, everything slowly faded to white. Then, from white, slowly, the blackness faded in.  I woke up. Once I landed back into reality from the nightmare, I looked around my dorm room, everything seemed normal. It was quiet, not a sound to be heard. I needed to get out for some fresh air after something as traumatizing as what I just went through, so I looked over at my room mate, Samantha, and forced her to wake up.  "Mmmm... What?" she said in a groggy voice.  "I had THE worst nightmare, EVER."  "Oh, really. That's swell." She whispered as she was about to fall back asleep. I didn't want to go alone, so I forced her with some good old fashioned Angelina bribery techniques.  "I swear to god, anything you want right now can be yours. Think of the cheetooooos."  "Cheetos... I would like some cheetos..."  "Then lets get going!"  "Okay. I'll, uh, get something street worthy on and then we'll rock'n'roll in a sec here." She replied, getting up to put some clothes on in place of PJ's.  We walked to the gas station that was open 24/7 and got some snacks and slurpees. I told Sam all about my dream and, with a sleepy smile on her face, comforted me the best she could in her tired state. After talking about some other things, I heard something that took my breath right out from me.   I heard a fire truck go by. A second later it became apparent that there wasn't just the one,  because after that fire truck sped by, I heard a bunch drive right down the road full speed...  Full speed towards MY college.  I ran back in a full-on sprint, my friend behind me trying to catch up wondering what the hell was going on. When we finally arrived, I just became dead inside, dropping all the groceries to the floor. I stared, completely floored by what had just happened and to what I was looking at.  the college was in complete flames.  My friend and I didn't know what to say, but I don't think we would have said anything anyway even if we did know the words that should be spoken. Not after having me talk about my dream and then seeing this could we even comprehend to what was going on.   After the fire, they told the community what had happened. No one in the college survived. After many weeks of not even knowing where to start in order to understand what happened, we went through the mourning of our friends. Me and Samantha have become closer friends after that. Each day she says its because of me that she's alive today. I am her guardian angel, as she always tells me. And so on, after all the chaos, I started to wonder about the dream. I'm I a psychic, a fortune teller, why the fuck did I have that dream?  Even after all the questions have been made, I found it unnecessary to answer them. I'm alive today, and hopefully for a long time. In the end, Isn't that all that matters? Even so, That dream... No, that nightmare, has haunted me since. I have never had a dream like that since, and I hope I never do, or, to better put it, never have to.   I can't just leave it here as I have something I need to tell you, but this is all I will tell.   If you ever have a nightmare that scars you in a way you'll never forget, it may not just be a nightmare. It may be a warning. Heed that warning, or you may never see tomorrow ever again.      Oh, he knows whats going on. Smart little bad ass is looking out the window straight at a tiger. This I assure you.   Smelling salts, huh... smooth, guys. Smooth...   Will do, Thanks!   I have never thought of this before! I always wanted to try and do some research on what really happened to my friend, but I never knew where to start. Thank you for giving me another theory to work on. This incident is something I'll never be able to forget, and something that I hope to solve, thank you.    Look, I still don't know what happened, but for years it's haunted me. Keeping something inside your head as scaring as this is like having a lion in a rusted, old, creaky cage. At one point, you have to tell someone or that cage will break and let something dangerous come out. So here's what happened, or at least to an extant.  When I was twelve, me and my friend, Pat, wanted to try "The jump." "The jump" was this infamous legend passed around the school that captivated every kid who heard of it. The legend was that if you and  anyone else with you at the time jumped off a certain cliff and called out "catch me!" someone would catch you right before you fall. The thing about the legend was no one knew which cliff along the river was the right one to use. Almost every kid in my school had tried and failed. The assumption was that they had all picked the wrong spots, but this only motivated kids further to find the right cliff. I, at the time, thought it was something made up by a student at my school to scare others. But that didn't mean I wasn't a little captivated myself.  One day, my friend Patrick came running to me with this excited look on his face and told me, "Matt, I swear to god, I found it!" Patrick was always a little infatuated with this tale, and as a result of this, he had wanted to find the real cliff ever since he heard about it. He continued on by explaining how he over heard his parents talking about a cliff where someone had died.  "It's got to be the real thing! Someone died there! They have to be the ghost that catches you before you fall!" Pat exclaimed. I was curios, so I decided to tag along and see the cliff that Pat was so sure about.  Now, before I go any further, I need to explain that this is where things got strange. This is the point where I cannot for the life of me explain as to why these things happened. I wish I could, maybe then I could get closure.  When we got there, I could feel a chill down my spine, the uneasiness in the air, and felt as if I had stepped directly into another dimension. But all that was topped off with the drop from the cliff. Even as a twelve year old, I knew that the fall would most likely kill someone. With all of that into consideration, it was Pats enthusiasm that really got to me. I knew that this whole time he had doing the jump in mind, and after seeing the hell-bound fall, he looked all to ready to just fall a good few miles down to his death.  "Pat, are you crazy!? That fall will kill us!" Pat gave me this confused look and said, "What in the world are you talking about? Sure, it's a good few feet, but kill us?" He then continued with a hint of laughter and legitimate confusion, "I think you're the crazy one here."  I was shocked. Pat was always a down-to-earth, smart, and sensible kind of guy. His answer was a slap in the face to me. A few feet? No way in hell that this drop was a few feet. I didn't know what to say, and before I could get any words out to Pat, he turned to face the cliff.   "Come on!" he said, "We gotta do it together!"  I couldn't. I was scared and could feel my mortality tugging at me. I shook my head and quietly said no. Pat still looked confused and started to even look a little worried for me.  "I'll tell you what, I'll go first and then you can see for yourself if it's okay or too much for you." He then took a good run and jumped.  I ran as fast I could to catch him, but I was just to far away to get to him in time. He yelled "WOOHOO!!!" as he took the leap. It only took three seconds of him falling until he broke out into a horrid scream. I saw him flailing his arms and legs all over in protest until he reached the water. A defining splash sounded out silently as if two hard rocks collided with each other. I knew for sure that the fall had killed him. There is no way he survived from a drop that far down. I didn't cry, I didn't fall on my knees either, I just ran as fast as I could.  I kept running in a full on sprint through the woods. I didn't care about the bushes that scratched at my legs, or the low down branches that whipped my face, I just wanted to run away from there. But out of no where, catching me completely off guard, was the most terrifying thing I have ever heard. It was screaming. It was the loudest, most helpless scream I have ever been able to experience in my life. This literally sounded like the act of murder being committed right in front of me. I kept running and running until I made it out of the woods. When I finally did make it out of the brush, the screaming slowly faded away.  I have never told anyone, not even the police about what happened. Patrick was declared missing, and I somehow grasped tight onto my secrecy of what really happened to him. You have to understand, I was so scared, and I still am today.   Years later, here I am writing this out in hopes I can find at least some closure as to what really happened that day. It's just that... Out of everything that happened to me that day, It was the look on Patrick's face that has haunted me the most to this day. He looked So... Excited.    The Haunting - Absolutely awesome.    	16
    Thanks!   Thanks, I think that was it.   I just started playing destiny so I'm only level 5, but I've found a few times that I'll start a mission and some of the enemies are way to high of a level for me to beat, and they're immune at all my attacks. How do I avoid this? Thanks and sorry if this is a stupid question   Those words have never stopped me before   I love you.

 Steven+Sugilite?   Where were u when society was fuck   My book backlog is beyond ridiculous. I find that my main problem is that while I'm reading, sitting in silence actually hurts my concentration. Of course, a lot of the music I've tried tends to be rather distracting (or at the very least, doesn't fit the mood). What are your thoughts? Any recommendations?   Sci Fi- the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. It's easily my favorite book of all time (the first sequel as well, the rest kinda got away from me) and outside of Foundation, a good candidate for greatest Science Fiction novel.   That being said, the Foundation books are probably also on there. I can't say for certain, I've never actually finished them (sorry)  Superhero/Graphic Novel- Watchmen. Fuckin'... duh.   Though as for graphic novels, I would also like to give a shoutout to the Neon Genesis Evangelion manga, if only because I love NGE, and the graphic novel is pretty spectacular.    Sugilite should be sponsored by Monster.

Don't get me wrong, Strong in the Real Way is probably the second or third best song in the show, but Sugilite totally should have gotten a verse.

A man cuts off his hand and almost destroys the world by reading a book.    Unless you mean something other than a continuation of the same story, then in pretty sure you agree.    According to Bruce Campbell, Evil Dead 2 actually is a sequel in the traditional sense. They couldn't get the rights to their own movie, so instead they made the first part of the movie a sort of modified recap of the first movie. If you took the end of ED1 (when Ash gets hit in the face with the first-person thing) and put it in ED2 when he gets hit again, you'd have the proper continuity.

Isn't it like that in Rebuild because of Tunniel?   It starts out with bands like One Direction to catch the defener crowd, but by the end of the show they're delving into more loved classic bands like the Beatles. "But /u/test_subject8582," I hear you asking "Surely there are people who would be perfectly accepting of the Beatles' songs 24/7. Many people probably already do that." So my solution: start off with their good stuff (first couple days alternate between Lucy in the Sky, Sgt Pepper, etc.) but as people refuse to leave, slowly start replacing songs with their worse songs (Swap out Yellow Submarine in the rotation for Octopus' Garden for example). By the season finale, we have people listening exclusively to Yoko Ono's contributions.    "I'm not my mom! I'm me! Steven the digger! Just who the heck do you think I am?!"

Amethyst plays Mewtwo, because he's purple and cool.    Are you referring to End of Evangelion? The 1997 movie? Because we can't link to pirated content.

PSA: The only acceptable name for Silver Mario is T-1000.    So like the Gurren Lagann movies?   I checked but it's not on there, only SAC 2nd GIG.    The DVD I got is called Individual Eleven and seems to be an OVA/Movie. I can't seem to find any timeline information for it.   I just recently finished the first season, so should I watch this after the second? After Solid State Society? Never?   Sneople control the government at the highest levels.    How the hell does Greg have such an awful sunburn if he wears the wifebeater all the time? Surely his tan lines would be very different considering that's just about all he wears.    It's not as cerebral as some of the stuff you have listed, but Hideaki Anno's directorial debut, Gunbuster, has some existential themes. It's also badass as fuck and i reccomend it as a knee jerk reaction to just about anything.   Ghost In the Shell (the original movie, and to a lesser extent the show) fits what you're looking for pretty nicely.    "A PICTURE WORT A THOUSAND WORDS! WHICH IS WHY I AM NOW EXPLAINING ITS SIGNIFICANCE TO YOU IN AS MUCH DEPTH AS I CAN MANAGE!!!!!!"   There's a good chance we'll be getting 3.0+1.0 before the 3.33 English BluRay.   Gay Alien Jesus didn't die for this.    Can I get this as a poster?   "looks like you're hiding from a serial killer! Would you like some advice on being stealthy?"    Well according to the retcon, they did work for Stalin...   I think the artist forgot they were drawing Asuka and not Mari right around the center,    Filthy Frank   They were also working with Stalin, Genghis Khan, and Mao. They also probably inspired Judas.    rot in peace   Probably a Tumblr reaction to jokes.    I like that they did that, since it helps all the characters from different universes (and more importantly, art styles) to be in one game at the same time. It's not quite as good as Smash, but it works.    Madoka Magica (especially the film, Rebellion) is pretty mindfucky.    How the hell would I read the message to run if you don't have it.    Sex sells.    Fun fact: discrimination in places of public accommodation is against the law. Lose your job, asshole!   "You're a kid now..."   [I think they all believed him in the end](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IW35t1H4yfk)      I legitimately thought this was Deep Dream.    hey its me ur brother   ~~FUCK. HOW DO THESE THINGS ALWAYS SELL OUT BEFORE I HEAR ABOUT THEM. GOD FUCKING DAMNIT.~~  Edit: nvm I got one. We still good.    The anime's getting pretty lewd.    -Gurren Lagann  -Gunbuster (and to a lesser extent, its sequel Diebuster)   "Burden of evidence? What's that?"   "I think you copied"  "I didn't. Where do you think I copied from?"  "Fuck off asshole you copied I ain't gotta prove shit"   "Men are taught from birth to believe they're always right! As a woman, I know this to be objective fact, because I'm always right!"   How do you feel about dinosaur laser fights?  In space?  With sharks?   It's okay you can swear on the Internet.    I just can't figure out Seel.    Not limited by the balances of Smash Bros, these two duke it out to see who's really our boy.    [FORFEIT MY NIGGA](https://youtu.be/wubpjxB4O7M)   This is the worst thing to happen to Terminator since Terminator 3.    Happened to me while I was playing Roy earlier.    I wouldn't go so far as to call them *filthy*, but they're definitely dirty.    No   Ia! Ia! Cthulhu fthagn!   [thats not all](http://imgur.com/dvUd5Ig)   The Z-Fighters were too powerful by the Saiyan Saga. Picollo could blow up the Moon, Nappa levelled an entire city (which might put him on Godzilla's level, considering he took a city busting meteor without so much as a scratch), Vegeta was apparently a *planet buster* (though that's apparently non-canon). And we can't forget how powerful the Destructo-Disc is. Godzilla doesn't stand a chance, much as I would like him to.    Fast  The Flash, hands down.    I've been playing as Rosalina whenever she was an option since Mario Kart Wii.    Is there some unspoken rule that all screenshots have to be on a near-death battery percentage?   I hope it doesn't look like Advent Children. The characters just don't look good when you make them that realistic. It looks like cosplay, in a bad way. Especially since they choose to play up Cloud's Elmo factor.    Rekt is non negotiable.    Is Andy Samberg hitting on Cera's cousin?   JFK was a proud POC!!   [Smiley](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2025667/)   How so?    Not quite the song you're looking for (That's either Good or Don't Be, or The Heady Feeling of Freedom) but [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HW_Ez3nV0ic) is a slower a Capella version of the song.    This is absolutely satire. It's even making fun of one of the worse (non-satire) minion memes, in which "a big black man raping you in the ass" is replaced by "if people are talking behind your back"   It was the voice actress for Rei/Yui screaming, but pitched down. That's what they did for both the dub and sub, iirc.    From the Inception episode.    While it's certainly not for everyone, its influence alone is a reason to watch it. Seeing where the mech genre, and really most modern anime, get some of their inspiration from is worth 26 episodes and a movie. In addition, End of Evangelion is the 2001: A Space Odyssey of anime in many ways.     Still has better animation than the actual show.    Because as she's proven since, she totally deserved to be given power.    Been doing that for the past couple decades.    I'd also like to point out that this minion is putting on blackface.       That's the joke I was going for.    I always just slide the stick up and down the bottom-right quarter. Like doing a Hadouken backwards then a regular Hadouken. I find it works rather well.    It's easy to tell the difference because one has no boobs and the other is a guy.    The problem with putting STTGL against enemies like SP1M is that Spiral Power is the negation to any rational argument against itself. It exists to do nothing but not make sense. It would be like having SP1M fight Bugs Bunny, since Toonforce is the same as Spiral Power. The only difference is that instead of being able to do anything as long as it would be funny, Spiral Power can do anything as long as it would be badass.    It's silly, but it's how it works.  literally Gurren Lagann in one sentence.       Super Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann wins, thanks to its near infinite Spiral Power. Simon can literally do the impossible, as he's won battles he had a 0% chance of winning. Spiral Power is the most powerful form of reality warping and STTGL has it in spades.    It'd be effective at getting me to turn off my Adblock if it weren't for the fact that now I have it on out of spite.    Palutena's God-tier and you know it.    Disco MILF is the best anime adult.   Judgement.    Every time I mention Squid Girl people just assume it's tentacle porn.    By Evangelion standards, they totally are.    Evangelion and Gunbuster. If only because Noriko and Shinji would be the best couple.    Also when Touji punches Shinji, and Shinji doesn't want to fight back. That's foreshadowing the events surrounding Bardiel.    One of us is a whiny German bitch, one of us is a badass space robot pilot, one of us is a badass space robot pilot *and hot*, one of us Is an 80-meter self-regenerating giant monster full of questionably edible meat who also happens to be immortal and a mother, and one of us is an invisible robotic cop.   Pretty sure Yui Ikari can spare some legs thanks to the S2 engine.    Asshole Goku would have killed Earth within a few years, meaning he never would have learned anything about the Dragon Balls, the Kamehameha, or anything else that gives Goku his immense power. He never would have been able to learn from any other Saiyans, considering they were all dead.   Real Goku stomps 10/10   Sparkle sparkle sparkle!   Jon is always relevant, isn't he? He's like a human Guile's Theme.    Noriko takes Simon's core drill, and they trade robots and duke it out. Simon is post-timeskip.   Round 1: Noriko in regular Gurren Lagann vs Simon in Noriko's machine weapon from the first epsiode.   Round 2: Noriko in space-Gurren Lagann (the one with wings) vs Simon in Noriko's space Machine Weapon.   Bonus round: They replace each other in their respective shows. Can Noriko defeat Lordgenome and the Antispiral? Can Simon, stripped of Spiral Power, defeat the space monsters and still have an entirely unrelated sequel?   Falcomaster 3000 has been unmasked!   Shiek and Zelda. Keep it between a man and a woman.    [Because it rhymes](https://youtu.be/9_ISZJVXxoU)   I welcome the sweet embrace of Instrumentality.       Fuck does Nono have to do with this? Leave Diebuster alone!   The only thing I could think of would be to find your own 1-2 inch Squid Girl figure and just replace the Inkling girl. If you did this, you'd probably also have to paint the ink on the base Ika's shade of blue.    they banned the Evil Dead? Clearly they haven't let go of their fascist censorship.    There's no real *counter*evidence to the order being Rebuild then NGE, but there's almost no evidence in favor of that theory. NGE then Rebuild, on the other hand, has loads of evidence to suggest that it directly follows NGE in the grand timeline. Kaworu's dialogue in both his cameos in 1.11 and 2.22 as well as a couple lines in 3.33 imply that he's been through this before, while episode 24 has no such implications. Even a bunch of the Angels (notably Ramiel) are more powerful than they had been before. Combined with the red sea and potential Mass-Production Evangelion (from End of Evangelion) outline on the hill in the opening of 1.11, there's really not a lot to say that Rebuild isn't a sequel to something, assuming you buy into Time Loop theory at all, that is.   Really, we'll probably end up getting confirmation one way or the other when 3.0+1.0 comes out.    In the dub I watched he was Mr Satan.   	166
 The dessert was using the Fritos to scoop up the leftover chili and cheese!   Fritos corn chips.  Where you from?   These were some high-end pork   venison sausage dogs that had jalapenos already in the dog.  Maybe some battered fried jalapeno slices for garnish?   That steak looks great but those potatoes and broccoli are something that definitely won't be ignored!      I've never used one so I can't comment.  I am thinking about getting a Big Green Egg!  Grill, smoker and "oven" up to 750F!  Expensive but worth it.   Here's the pics you asked for.  Couldn't get the specialty tortilla section.  Tell your friend that this doesn't included the regular commercial bread, rolls, bun selection.   http://imgur.com/a/xo39p   You have to introduce some kind of moisture somewhere in the cooking process.  Straight grilling or baking in the oven won't achieve what you're trying for.  You can use water, juice, beer etc.  You really don't want to cook them until they fall off the bone.  Points are taken away in competition for that.  Try to find that sweet spot where they adhere to the bone but easily come off when eaten.  Most people use the 3-2-1 but it's not an exact science.  Happy Ribbin'      I find it interesting that people equate race with nationality.  Here in Texas a lot of our best Japanese chefs are from Mexico which is not surprising if you know the political mandates and laws that were passed in the US and Mexico.  Food/Cuisine seems to be a wonderful connection that crosses racial and political boundaries!  Yea!   Are you to tell me that there are white people with a Swedish, German and Russian background that were born and raised in Mexico or other South American countries that are considered true Mexicans ect.?    WTF is transraciality,  (excluding that woman from the NAACP)?   I'm sure your fatty friends, if you have any, appreciate such a thoughtful gesture KimcheeBreath which no doubt describes you to a tee!   Actually she thought it was pretty funny and we're family.  BTW, I'm the one on the right so......      I've made literally thousands of meatloafs of all kinds, standard with ketchup glaze, Cajun, stuffed, rolled, you name it but IMO this is the best recipe I've found.  The key is to use fresh herbs. DO NOT substitute for dry.  http://food52.com/recipes/24302-fatted-calf-s-meatloaf    Before you eat something like this just imagine your heart looking just like the fat studded and nitrate infused yummyness that it is!      I'd pay for it only if they sprinkled fleur de sel on it along with some sort of amazing dipping sauce.    I'll take some pics and post soon.  In the meantime, tell your German friend that Texas has a long and close history with the German and Czech people.  Our beloved Chicken Fried Steak is based on Schnitzel.  Our best Brewery's were originally owned by Germans immigrants.  There was a time when some small towns in Texas printed their newspapers in German and after a century had passed,  European German speakers couldn't make hide nor hair what the locals Germans were saying!   Here's a link to one of the original German restaurants.  http://kubys.com/about-us/   Ah onions!  I was thinking it looked somewhat lumpy.   You got it!   You missed a chip with the sour cream.   I like the diamonds better than the squares.  For some reason it looks more appetizing.      What if the painter was also a crazy a$$h013?        Here ya go.... http://imgur.com/PXUuOeo   8 layer mexican dip cake.  I need a better name for this lol!    I was tempted to make a respectable version of the Bologna Cake but my hubby talked me out of it.  I still think I could make one that Lola wants!   Sour cream and cream cheese.     I do to and I feel for anyone that doesn't have one close.   Si         I may just do that if you make me a sandwich lol!   Fancy mayo, Tillamook cheese and Jim Beam and you can cook.  Are you married?  If not, do you want to be?   You could use anything your heart desires.     Couldn't decide between making cinnamon rolls or cherry Kolaches so I did both.   The original ratatouille recipe had the vegetables fried before baking. Since at least 1976, top French chefs have prepared the ratatouille vegetables in thin slices instead of the traditional rough-cut.[citation needed] Michel Gurard, in his book founding cuisine minceur (1976),[3] recreated lighter versions of the traditional dishes of nouvelle cuisine.[4] His recipe Confit bayaldi, differed from ratatouille by not frying the vegetables, removing peppers and adding mushrooms.  American celebrity chef Thomas Keller first wrote about a dish he called "byaldi" in his 1999 cookbook, The French Laundry Cookbook.[5] Keller's variation of Gurard's added two sauces, a tomato and peppers sauce at the bottom (piprade), and a vinaigrette at the top.[6][7] He served as food consultant to the Pixar film Ratatouille, allowing its producer, Brad Lewis, to intern for two days in the kitchen of his restaurant, The French Laundry. Lewis asked Keller how he would cook ratatouille if the most famous food critic in the world were to visit his restaurant.[1] Keller decided he would make the ratatouille in confit byaldi form, and fan the vegetable rounds accordion-style with a palette knife.[8] - Wikipedia   Maybe r/shittyfoodporn would help LOL!   Thumbs up to anyone that makes their own fresh pasta.  Looks good!      Please stop trying to recreate the Ratatouille from the movie.  The original is so much better.        You should try it sometime.  This is my Thai dog with carrots, cucumbers, scallions, peanut sauce and sriracha.   http://imgur.com/dQuYpMU    Kinda thought so. Thanks!    Here's the ingredients for the chili.  Up to you to figure out how prepare.  Can't give away all my secrets!  Hint:  don't add all the spices at one time.  10 lb chuck roast, lg dice Vegetable oil for browning the beef 3 lg sweet yellow onions, med dice 2 1/2 qt beef stock 2 cups stout beer 42 oz whole tomatoes, fresh or canned 2 cups picante sauce 3 fresh limes 12 roasted garlic cloves 5 Tbls roasted cumin seeds, crushed 10 Tbls chili powder 1 cn tomato paste 3 jalapenos, green, whole, pickled 2 jalapenos, red, fresh 2 habanera peppers, fresh 3 cups nopales (cactus) 1 cup corn masa 1 dark chocolate bar 3 cans black beans, optional! 3 cans chili beans, optional! salt and pepper, to taste   No, it's "Angie's Bikkles" in Fort Worth.  I've heard of a place in Arlington, "Jamaican Gate" that they tell me is really good too.   When you eat a Chicago dog do you take the peppers off and then take bites as you go or do you leave them on and get one or two big bites of pepper?   It's my recipe for chili that I used for a Navy chili cook-off when I was stationed on the USS Halsey (Hit hard, Hit fast, Hit often!)    This look absolutely beautiful!  I didn't know day lilies were edible!  I was expecting watermelon pickles instead of pickled watermelon.       Nice photo but this is chips and dips, or the makings of a salad and not nachos!       In the 70's my mother was fired from her job because I fell and and broke my arm and the babysitter couldn't drive me to the hospital and my mom couldn't pay for an ambulance.  I'm sure Jeb and Cruz would approve!       RIP.   Only if you like surprises, thanks though!   To be honest it was okay.  The chorizo Spam was a bit overwhelming.  I'd use it again but diced up and used more as a seasoning.  I think the original, hickory or bacon Spam would work better waffled.     Same with garlic cloves VVV.  The green sprout should be removed as it has a bitter flavor.   Recipe:  4 oz bacon, diced and cooked 2 oz Swiss cheese, shredded 1 blind baked pie shell 4 eggs 1 pt milk 4 oz heavy cream salt and pepper, to taste pinch of nutmeg  Place the bacon and shredded cheese in the baked pie shell.  To make the custard, combine the eggs, milk and cream, and season with salt, pepper and nutmeg.  Pour the custard over the bacon and cheese and bake at 350F until the custard is cooked, approximately 1 hour.  I used a large quiche/tart pan but a 9 in pie pan can also be used.         http://allrecipes.com/recipe/coconut-haupia-and-chocolate-pie/  I reversed the layers for contrast plus the coconut layer is slightly thicker then the chocolate layer.    Enjoy!      You have booths in your kitchen besides the kitchen table?  Nice try.    Jeb, Barack and Will Wheaton on the same page?  Must be bad!   Rinsing browned hamburger in hot water instead of just letting it drain washes away a lot more of the fat/calories.  Not sure the exact amount but it helps.       It's a truck but they have a permanent location next to a bar with whom they share picnic tables.  Are you in Texas?   Wanted to give a ^ but your tomato soup looks like puke.  Maybe add some tomato paste/sauce.   Some people that have actually died and said they went to heaven and saw loved ones there.  How is this possible when the bible says that no one shall enter heaven until after the Judgement Day?     Wish I could make that trip!     That's original.  Why?  Don't like Ranch?      What restaurant were you at?   Looks great but most Wellingtons have a layer of duxelle or herbs between the pastry and roast.    I used it for Stroganoff when I didn't have sour cream and I've made it a part of the recipe ever since.     Looks like a Mexican Thanksgiving!  OMG, plate one!   I recommend Ranch dressing for a substitute.  Any way you still win!      Add some smashed roasted garlic and I think I could live on this for the rest of my life!   Did ya'll know that giraffes snore?      Nope.   Wish I knew!  Maybe I'll ask next time I go.   Pho Hung on Camp Bowie.   Pho Hung on Camp Bowie.  Brand new and very nice.    Let Jesus know!      "Bun Bo Nuong Xa", Lemongrass beef with rice noodle and vegetables.   During and after the US Vietnam war many refugees were located in specific areas in the US.  Texas was one of them.  I lived in a three story bottom-floor apartment in the 70's and the two (three bedroom) apartments above housed a total of 17 Vietnamese.  Their rent was subsidized by churches and their church buses would pick them up every Sunday,  then drop them off.  Guess what?  Every religious holiday they celebrated that was not Christian, they celebrated above our apartment.  We even had a white guy that sold Vietnamese food out of the back of a U-haul in our apartment lot!  Still love the cuisine!!            Asian-Mex!  Look up the history of Chinese immigration into Mexico and you'll get it.  Mexicans have an appreciation and love of Chinese cooking that most of America doesn't get.      Pretzel roll.      Yes, specifically avocado puree with a touch of lemon juice.     At least you called it Country Fried steak instead of Chicken Fried Steak.  The two are not the same.  Yours looks yummy and reminds me more of a Swiss (tomato) or Smothered Steak a la Soul Food.   Maybe.   What's the scoop on restaurant tomatoes?   I made literally thousands of these in the Navy.  Confused the hell out of me when people referred to a sausage wrapped in a pastry dough as a kolache.  Found out the proper name for the later is  klobasnek.        You need to check out Pearl Snaps in Ft Worth.     I first thought you were giving us your recipe for a lobster filling lol.      http://food52.com/recipes/24302-fatted-calf-s-meatloaf  Notes: 1.  If you don't want to use a grinder just use 1 1/2 lbs ground beef, 1 lbs ground pork, add flavor packet and let sit overnight. 2.  Add the remaining fennel seeds and chili flakes to the glaze. 3.  The panade is the bread mixture. 4.  The leftover drippings make a wonderful tomato gravy.       Tossed the lettuce with a little Italian dressing.  Added some creole mustard to mayo for the spread.  We've got a JerseyMikes's here, will have to check it out!   "The Living Years"   You've never had to breakaway from crazy people.   Who?   It puts ketshup on steak and rubs it on.  Yuik!      Saggy britches.  It's been two decades and getting worse!  Will it ever go away?  This guy explains it better than me.  https://youtu.be/zE507JkQtfw     Good news!  Pork doesn't have to be cooked like your mom probably did,  grey on the inside with the consistency of leather.  Updated USDA rules:  http://blogs.usda.gov/2011/05/25/cooking-meat-check-the-new-recommended-temperatures/       Flour fire.  Never smoke while baking!   Can't confirm above.  All I know is distilled white vinegar and baking soda is excellent when used to clean out drains or make table-top volcanoes for third-grade science projects.  lol!    Try this "home" solution:  1/4 cup white vinegar, 1-2 Tsp Dawn detergent, 1/4 cup Arm   Hammer "washing soda"  found in the cleaning isle.  Don't substitute baking soda, not the same thing!, 2 gal hot water.  Mix until bubbly.  A little goes a long way.  Don't use on waxed floors, JS.    Maybe invest in a good steam cleaner and use after mopping.  Steam works great to help to kill bacteria too!     Since I can I now dub the combination of "Hotter than Hell" pasta with coconut shrimp and a cooling banana dipping sauce I hereby declare thee, "Shrimp Loki"!   Here's most of the recipes:  Coconut Shrimp  1. Shell (leave the tail), devein and butterfly 1-lbs of 21/26 fresh shrimp.  Thoroughly dry with paper towels. 2.  Set up 3 bowls.  First bowl with 1/2 cup flour, 1 Tsp cayenne or ground red pepper, 1/2 Tsp of cracked black pepper.  Second bowl with 3/4 cup pancake batter or Bisquick and 3/4 cup flat beer.  Third bowl with 2 cups coconut flakes either sweetened or not. 3.  Take each shrimp and dip into 1st bowl, shake excess off.  Dip into 2nd bowl, let drip or shake off excess then place in 3rd bowl with the cut side spread open and down then cover with coconut and press lightly to gently stick.  Place each shrimp, tail side up, onto a pan lined with wax paper and lightly coated with coconut.   4.  Refrigerate for 1/2 hour or freeze for future use. (If freezing, make sure shrimp aren't touching) 5.  Heat deep-fat fryer to 350F.  Holding the shrimp by the tail, lower until the shrimp is covered with oil and then carefully hold for 30 seconds then let drop into the fryer.  Fry for 3 +/- minutes if refrigerated until golden brown.  (If frozen,  fry until golden brown then place in an oven to finish cooking the shrimp.  Drain on paper towels and serve.    Caribbean Hushpuppies    At this point I had batter, flour and coconut leftover so I just mixed them until I had the proper consistency and using one spoon to gather about a Tbsp and another to drop it off into the hot oil,  I fried them until they floated.  I served this with a tropical "Pasta from Hell",  spicy dipping banana sauce and Key Lime Pie.  Recipe provided on request.           Tried the Outback recipe and another that said to mix some of the coconut with the batter.  Refrigerated and froze both but the batter still fell off.  Finally found Bubba Gump's "Dumb Luck" recipe and with a few tweaks it came out perfect!      	118
 I think Salinger intentionally left the end of Holden's story as an ambiguous one that could be interpreted one of two ways:  **1) Optimistic:** Holden is doing much better, enjoying life more, and genuinely missing people. He will be headed to a new school soon and he is looking forward to that.  **2) Pessimistic:** Holden is just as deluded and disconnected as ever before. He thinks he is getting out of the psych ward soon, but it is just a false hope. The telling of his story shows the current state of his mental health, and it is not a good diagnosis.  *How did you interpret the conclusion of The Catcher in the Rye?*   Yeah. A year and a half ago we bought a "dwarf mix" bunny. I guess the dwarf was mixed with a giant because she is *not* small!         That's exactly what I did. Though I had enough money to pass that check as well.   I had a room in Novac fairly early in my run. Still prefer it to the presidential suite.    The only mods I use are ones that enhance aesthetics. I don't have any that affect gameplay.   I didn't check. I had a lot though but that wasn't from mere scavenging. I kind of have no qualms about using the merchant exploit for more caps.   It was a blast! (especially when I met the Boomers...)   It wasn't entirely intentional that I am just now entering The Strip. I followed where I felt the game was leading me all the way down south then east before heading up north to Freeside. Once there, I had other quests to take care of that to me as far north as Nellis AFB and as far west as Jacobstown.      It wasn't entirely intentional that I am just now entering The Strip.

I just spent the last thirty minutes listening to the voice actors you've listed above. You are an *incredible* voice caster. I hope you're hired!   Our Secret Santa sent us not one, not two, but THREE cookbooks all uniquely meeting our personalities and palates!  **eat tweet** - A Twitter cookbook, each recipe pulled directly from Twitter and all under 140 characters.  **A Taste of Puerto Rico** - An authentic taste of a region unlike our own.  **The Butch Bakery Cookbook** - Hundreds of cupcake recipes that are delightfully different and dangerously delicious.  Thank you Santa! Our tummies will be pleasantly full for years to come!      I'm finding this summer sale somewhat underwhelming. There have been few games that have excited me and the sales themselves haven't been that impressive.    Does anyone else feel the same way?    I'm not sure if you've decided yet, but here is the opinion of a mega fan who has played each game in the series:   Begin with  **Final Fantasy X**.    The graphics are new enough to not be offensive or distracting to modern gamers. The story and world are both beautiful works of art. The cast of characters is unique while each party member still holds traditional JRPG roles. It's the first voice-acted Final Fantasy, so there are some flaws there, but still a great game overall.    There you are! I've been waiting for your posts!   I didn't even know it existed. When I came across it at the store tonight I had to make myself a spot on the floor and spend some time with it. It has original artwork and tons of incredible information.   I took a few pics:  [Encyclopedia Cover](http://i.imgur.com/IikVpyi.jpg?1)  [Introduction + Ezio](http://i.imgur.com/KWG2CUr.jpg)  [The Blades](http://i.imgur.com/5Q9rxJ9.jpg)  [Cast of Characters](http://i.imgur.com/1etjK3T.jpg)  My wife's favorite: [Haytham Kenway](http://i.imgur.com/Cej6yV7.jpg)   How did the new Wolfenstein turn out? This is the lowest it's ever been discounted. Is it worth it?   /u/lakinwecker I'm counting on you.      Thank you /u/Anatidaephobic_Duck for the source! I have made a brief list below of the potentially noticeable benefits of taking Fish Oil from the link you provided. Hopefully it will help others if they have the same question:  * Can stimulate brain activity. * Can help combat muscle soreness. * Supports healthy cholesterol. * Can increase and strengthen bone density. * Can benefit mood as it supports levels of serotonin. * May help to balance blood pressure.   I have been taking Triple Strength Omega-3 Gold (1,000 mg EPA+DHA per gel) once or twice a day for a couple of weeks now.   I'm not a huge supplement guy at all, but have read that taking a regular dose of fish oil is beneficial. So, I jumped on the bandwagon and got some high quality stuff.   Should I be noticing any kind of change or difference in anything?    My gift has *been* shipped and is now on its way to me. I wonder...   LOVE its color!   Every account on reddit is a bot except you.      My wife is making me watch this on repeat...and I'm not complaining one bit.   I've got to get my bunny a party shirt! Where can they be found?   Babi is like, "Here we go again..."   Guys, our bunny's shedding is OUT OF CONTROL!   It's not coming out in clumps and she isn't acting ill so I don't think that she is sick or anything. And it has only been going on for two weeks now. We just think that she is shedding her winter coat in preparation for summer. But it has never shed this much.   There are flurries of bunny fur flying around the room. When we pet her, our hands look like hairy gloves. Her cage now has carpet.  **Is it normal for bunnies to shed this much!?**      Can you always speak for bunnies? Please and thank you.         All of creation groans and suffers and has been subjected to futility (Romans 8:22). Those that have faith in God have been promised a day coming where sickness, corruption, and all groaning will cease.   For the believer in Christ, how could one afflicted as much as Peter *not* hold on to something as promising as that? For those in Christ, God has promised to guide all suffering for the good of his people (Romans 8:28).   Peter, and those like him, might just have the audacity to believe that their life here on earth, as short and painful as it might be, is just the beginning of their existence. And what was not afforded to them here in this life, will be richly given to them in the next.   2 Corinthians 4:16 - "So we do not lose heart. Though our outer self is wasting away, our inner self is being renewed day by day."   Trust me, she doesn't freeze. In fact, we've never been able to get her on her back to where she goes into that catatonic state. In the position seen in this picture, she is cupped nicely with her feet firmly supported to where she feels comfortable.   Don't we all!   Don't be fooled! My bunny lets me do that for about thirty seconds before wanting down. I do a little bit each day hoping that one day she will let me and not fight it.      Final Fantasy XIII's scene and sound is both breathtaking and tear-jerking in my opinion: [**Final Scene**](https://youtu.be/bn14Bu8vl5g?t=3m54s)  The sacrifice of friends. The return of others. The hope gained and the hope lost. It doesn't get much better.

Hey, this one is really good and really concise. Great jorb.   This sounds like the protagonists are the worst people ever.   **FF7**: Mercenary for hire joins terrorist organization to stop corrupt company.

 Fuck those ugly whores.    Fuck yeah you're right! Bad ass fucking book   ..okay.. i liked it too, chill.   Pretty good read.      THANK YOU!   Are there any good places to go swimming in Austin, that aren't man made?   Looks like Ronan TBH   Ur dum feg   Come save America Putin!   Death.   Sick little perv (;   http://i.ytimg.com/vi/CxX05swEeFQ/hqdefault.jpg This is actually the one in my town! Theres two in my town.    Look up fema domes.   Well, at least you won't be alone anymore.    Fuck yes.   /r/athiesm is over there   Terrifying? Or fucking awesome.    Is it though?   Life sucks balls at the point of a break up.    Hehe hijacked.   8th rule of reddit. Tidder.   third rule of reddit..   "UAV ONLINE!"   Nice but instead we learn about all the characters the first episode and by the end they are able to get out and the story continues.    Strange huh? Just a plane.    Do you?   /r/quityourbullshit    Ugly feminist whores.   You seem like a bad person to have dinner with.   Thank you (:   Where is the UNSC infinity?   So even though he came over here from another subreddit just to come antagonize me and i defended myself thats ok? Great mods here in /r/conspiracy.    Nah, just a government exercise.    Then why are you still here.   No wonder your mother wasn't around. She didn't wanna take care of a little faggot.     Take a hint fagboy. This movie is going to suck bellend.   /r/Mildlydisgusting    Same here, south Texas.    Fuck your mom. My mom stabbed my pit bull in the eye with a pen when she got bitten. Pussy.   IF the Government did try and take over it wouldn't be strategically smart. They are focusing on Austin, Dallas, and San Antonio area (for Texas obviously) if they did try and takeover they'd be surrounded, by us. If Texans Fought back that is, plus other states wouldn't really take too kindly to our "loving peace keeping government" taking over a state/'s. So in conclusion, this is a flex, we will most likely be okay. (Maybe)    Why not? People are getting rowdy, Obama supposedly is funding ISIS and all these things are happening why not throw us a curveball. See what we think when we see the strength of our military... but on us.   Personally, i just think its the Government Flexing they're strength. They sent the military to the biggest area/'s that are definitely the stronger/bigger parts of America and the ones most likely to retaliate.    Well, in a sense S1 is supernatural. In Rust's area of the story anyway, the hallucinogens that he took before all of this in themselves made him see supernatural things, bird symbol, wormhole thing, and when he's driving in the car. So yes in Rust's case S1 was supernatural.    No.   F u.   You do realize most of jade helm is taking place in non-rural areas correct? ( San Antonio, Austin,Dallas ) fucking dumb ass.

 so here is the idea with a spoiler to my movie idea. so you have Adam Sandler in a final destination type movie and he goes on this roller coaster. hes the only one on the roller coaster and it crashes and everyone dies except for him. so he is trying to figure out why people think he is dead and at the end of the movie it turns out it is Vince Vaughn and he just watched the accident live and believed he was Adam Sandler.      actually i think its every skin but infernal because he has a different laugh and taunt than his normal   see the new blitzcrank really just made the blitzcrank express for me you get homeguards on desired boots talisman of Ascension and activate W. if you have the right masteries when you are supposed to get slowed you are still going your normal speed or faster depending on runes and stuff. this can allow you to carry if you have good pulls because you will always be with the team able to run in and out.    Nasus has something similar i dont remember if its his laugh or taunt my friend macro'd nasus as well and its just duh duh duh duh all game   pantheon is still the same lane bully its not required he have his ult to gut an entire team. however if you want to talk what we could do to balance the nerf it would be simply to lower the CD on it. i don't believe pantheon needs more power its already insane how well he does early to mid game.   litterally just dont think about it to much the worse thing you can do to yourself in ranked is to get anxious. i know it will be hard to not get anxious i still do around promos but if you can handle it you will be in full concentration.  Tips  * look at enemy champions and try to remember all their abilities and how they synergize in team fights in comparison to yours.  * think about how much more experience you have with certain champs whether they are supports or carries.  * before reaching the lane try to think of a good build for the game if you are playing a diverse champion.  these are just things i have done to calm down in all my games other things i do is verbally talk out loud about what i do works alot for me.   i have a friend that uses macros for laughing and walking at the same time so hes never not laughing when hes moving and it can either keep you the same speed or some cases speed you up. its rare that it will speed you up i would check into that used to main singed myself so i know the feel.  	8
 California here. Go fuck yourself.   Song is dope man, the layering is pretty spot on. the vocal is in the mix pretty well too, maybe bus everything but the vocals to a compressor to give your voice and the mix a little separation but your delivery is on point man!   the beat is pretty cool, but sparse and lacking some low end.. just an old timey sample with drums behind it...maybe throw in a bassline or some subsonic shit to give it some bottom. The song itself is pretty good tho, and your voice sounds good too. the delivery is pretty decent however you might want to try doing a beat that is a little faster instead of trying to drag out some of your phrasing, I think your voice would be better suited for something a little quicker. Maybe try to compress the vocals a little to settle them into the mix or even just bring the volume down a little. other than that the lyrics were good and definitely something to keep doing!   thanks for that man! Yea I boosted a little around 150-250hz range to bring out a little more of that low end and I was just now playing my bass to the song but it was real quick and didnt think to try an octave lower.. I am going to give it a try and I agree on the hats as well, I think I just needed to hear someone say it to me! Thanks brotha!   https://soundcloud.com/kida760/summer-daze  it is a new instrumental I am working on. Let me know what you think. Feedback is greatly appreciated and will be returned   I agree with jmilnazikmusic, flight to catch is a dope track. The intro is nice interesting making me want to hear more. But the drums do sound like they are limited. You can almost hear them hitting the ceiling. There is alot going on in the high end that makes some the hits a little hard to take when you are listening to it on headphones. That being said, maybe take the limiter off and try to compress the drums a little bit to set them apart from the track a little bit with a high pass filter side chained just to maybe eliminate some of those higher frequencies when the mix is getting louder.   super fluid man, I like all the percussion clicks and pops going on all over the place! The vocal sample (not of the singing in the beginning) came in super hot and surprised me a little. maybe dial down a little bit so it settles in the mix a little more. Very interesting man and a nice listen for sure!      I like the raw sample feel to the song! Some of the scratches are a little off timing in the beginning but still nice sounding. I have to ask if it was you on the table? The swing to the song is nice as well and has a little bit of an interesting break in the middle and the kick was a little loud. All in all, I dug it!       tru hip hop is sample based if you look at the greats like Pete Rock, Jazzy Jeff, Dj Alibi..what you are talking about isnt really hip hop..

At that time, it was more about the time of day and not the date 4-20 but as time went on, both were adapted by the smoking culture.   It has everything to do with weed, officially.

 I have two!      One in my tablet and another one in my phone.   Here is a quote from another article:     More convincingly, however, was the analysis of the male skeleton. He was judged to be around 45 when he died, matching the age at which Philip was killed, but he was also found to have suffered a severe wound to his knee three years before his death.  This is consistent with reports of Philip's life: "As Philip was returning to Macedonia from the Scythian campaign against Ateas, the Thracian tribe of Triballoi met him and refused to allow him passage unless they received a share of the spoils," the researchers wrote. "Hence, a dispute arose and afterward a battle, in which Philip received so severe a wound through his leg by a lance that his horse was killed by it.  Analysis showed the male in Tomb I had leg bones with a stiffened knee joint, signs of bone fusion and a hole through the knee indicating a piercing wound. "Therefore, Philip's lameness is conclusive evidence for the identification of one tomb occupant as Philip."            *And I think it's gonna be a long, long, time   'Til touchdown brings me 'round again to find    I'm not the man they think I am at home    Ah, no no no    I'm a rocket man    Rocket man    Burnin' out this fuse    Up here alone*   Gnihihi...very good!

I found the pic on the official NASA website right here i think http://spaceflight.nasa.gov/gallery/images/shuttle/sts-135/ndxpage1.html    I apologize if i got this wrong.    Don' t get me wrong. I am on your side. Someone much smarter than me (Dr David Livingston) once said, and i quote:     *Manned space exploration is absolutely worth the investment. Its not just about what we learn out there in space, or about ourselves, or how to be a better steward of precious Earth. Its about how we live here on Earth together and what type of future we want for ourselves and children. Manned space exploration is the path to how we build a better life for ourselves here on Earth, and how we can give hope and provide inspiration for our youngsters to grow up, do the schoolwork, and accept the challenges that await them to make our world even better. Whatever we spend on manned space exploration is a bargain and our investment will be returned to us many times over, both quantitatively and qualitatively. From my perspective, we are getting this value at a bargain, as if we were all going to the dollar store for an end of the year sale.*     But we both don't fund NASA. I still hope the journey into space will continue and Roscosmos and Nasa actually will be working together on the programme of a future space station.   Nervermind. I thought that reference would be easy to understand.   But in times like today with all the economic problems it has to be a legitimate questionif space exploration is worth the cost.     *Any goal worth achieving involves an element of risk.*      - Dean Karnazes   But you got that going for youwhich is nice.

Quarter bin fodder. But I enjoyed Fat Ninja and Adolescent Radioactive Black Belt Hamsters.   Hey, I enjoyed GLA. Grasshopper got worse luck than Spider-Man.   This is the insane shit I want Grant Morrison to reintroduce.   Kinda like a real life YouTube comment .   Franklin Richards looks like he is gonna fuck up the Hulk.         And Leon is getting laaaaarrrrrger.   Johnny, how 'bout some more coffee?    I can make a hat or a brooch or a pterodactyl...    Old people who go nuts at Obama and watch Fox News.  Thanks Obama.   I can make a popper.   Someone text messaged me in Spanish one night. I replied "Taco Burrito Aqua Rickey Martin"   She's hotter than a stolen car.   My room mates bought me a car bed.   Dat ass.   My Dad would bring me to the bar with him when I was a kid. Would sit at the bar beside him with a Dr.Pepper and play hearts or spades with the woman who owned the place.  It was the 80's. Never saw a fight in there and the people who owned it was my cousins grandmother.   I had a guy pull a gun on me while I was on shopping cart duty. He was pissed cause I didnt offer to help him boost his car off.    My neice walked up to me earlier with a bible in her hand and told me she found the dinosaur book and it told her that Jesus rode Velociraptors. Shes 3!   Me and this guy who is a underground rapper from Memphis was playing checkers in an abandoned trailer one night back in 1997. He started beating me and I got pissed off, took the checker board and chunked that shit in the air. Well after we picked all those checkers up, he got knocked upside the head by a checker that came outta nowhere A MINUTE AFTER WE PICKED THEM ALL UP.  Rapper friend gets hit in head by phantom checker in an abandoned trailer.   EDIT : Got downvoted cause nobody believes me.   Like Code Red.   The baby was the only child under 3 that entered the beauty pagent. She was few months old, the old hag judges said fuck this shit we giving this Dr.Evil baby a ribbon.    This is what I remember. Way back in 2002, I was working in the Pet Department and my job was to catch fish out of the aquarium. The fair was in town and when the fair is in town, it is BATSHIT crazy. All these kids winning goldfish and their parents would go in Wal-Mart to get fish bowls,food,etc. Well, one day after I got off lunch (I was eating at McDonalds in my store because no car) and my stomach was..lets say not playing nice with me. A woman with her Grandson came in with a bag of goldfish and wanted someone to catch a specific one as a mate to the one he won at the fair. I'm off to the floor, they call my name, I go straight to the aquariums. The lady wanted a fish out of the goldfish tank that had a stripe over the eye. Now, mind that the tank had 1000 goldfish and that catching the specific one is time consuming. I'm over at the tanks FOR 4 GOD DAMN HOURS trying my balls off to catch this fucking fish. Her kid is at the tank ohh and ahhing. The Grandparent is over there placing her fingers on the glass THE WHOLE GOD DAMN TIME pointing out this bastard. Stomach made a noise, then I fuckin farted. Loud. I mean it echoed down the aisle. As this gas was rumbling in the bowels of my ass hell, I tried to fake a cough. I farted, fake cough was off by 2 seconds. I didnt do shit but ignore it. I farted, we glanced at each other and no big deal was made. It stunk, I mean worse than dead fish. So, the next day I come in, manager calls me up. I go in, he is asking me questions about me being rude. I'm like..what do you mean? He explained to me that I was being rude in front of a customer. "What?". "How?" No response. I got fired, next day I get a call from a guy I worked with that explained to me that because of my loud, smelly fart I got wrote up and fired. Escorted off the premesis and signed papers saying I will never work with them again.      Boomerang Bow Ties.   The speed of dark.   I used to call people from Craigslist at 3 in the morning. It went like this.  Me - You still got that Chevy Citation for sale?  Guy - Why the fuck you calling me at 3 AM?  Me - You didn't say what time not to call.  I also would call Sonic and ask if they still had any specials on Big Macs.   EDIT : Once called Ms.Cleo. She asked me my name.  "Bitch, you the psychic. You're supposed to know"   I watched a guy walk in the park with a mask on few days ago.    I fed a turkey some turkey once, I witnessed a baby with no hair win best hair at a pageant, I was fired for farting, I watched people fight over toasters, and I once seen a miniature horse get mounted by a Billy goat. I seen so much crazy shit..    Either it was a Hilton or a Holiday Inn?   YOU BELONG IN A MUSEUM!   I rather see a Tinder or Snapchat leak.   Gamefaqs.com has great tips for cheating.   Politicians are so full of shit. Wharton is just Herenton in a better suit.  Herenton used to have a private room at the Hilton downtown and I wouldn't doubt if Wharton does too.   I have no clue but I been listening to Local X alot more. It has that 93X vibe to it.   Are you serious? What about the hotels  there?   Fun fact : Homeless people get robbed in Memphis too.   Trigger alert.   They already had people breaking into cars there.   Everything I learned about Memphis was from the Wake Up Crew on Rock 103. RIP Bad Dog and 93X.   Lead singer of Poison was arrested there for mooning the crowd or something there once. Was Ozzy playing a concert there and after the concert he was arrested for pissing on Beale? Or was it the time he freaked the fuck out after a concert and they found Ozzy on I-240 drunk and naked?  Fun Fact: Judas Priest recorded a live album at the Mid-South Coliseum. Same place where Jerry Lawler fought Andy Kaufman.   Stone Cold threw The Rocks title in the river too.   *steel   No Timecop?   Any Deftones album.   I seen someone download the Beatles Discography once.   I got flashbacks to 80's Transformers with that one Dino bot Jet.   The Star Wars reprint has a black Diamond price box on the cover. I should know, I bought a 3 pack of the first 3 issues of Star Wars in a 3 pack for a buck in the early 90's. Wish I still had the reprints. I know a comic shop in Jackson,Tn has issue 1 but it's sunburnt.   Local Goodwill here quit selling VHS tapes and tube TVs.   I have a metric fuckton of 60s-00s Richie Rich and Hot Stuff comics in the same shape. I usually sell them for 25 cents each because not much of a demand here for kid books.   Writing prompt : Superman loans Animal Man Krypto for overpowered supervillan cases.   Aldo Rains?   Wet Hot American Summer   Korn, Limp Bizkit, Deftones, Staind.     52 was great and alot of the concepts that came out of it was mishandled. The superhero hospital, Dr.Cyclops, Egg-Fu, Poledancer, I.Q., Ambush Bug,etc. To actually get back to telling a good story with second stringers and keep the main 3 out...   It motivated me to stay away from his movies.   So is this satire?   This. Is. Awesome.   I'm allergic to cats but I love them.   Crash Test Dummies Mmm Mmm Mmm Mmm   What kind of work are you doing now and what shows did you work on?  I have 2 cousins who work in Hollywood I never met. One is (or was) a lead singer in a band that peaked in the late 90's during Nu-Metal.   Overlord sounds like Alice In Chains for some reason.  But Lamb Of God kicks major ass.   HORSE The Band, Toxic Holocaust, Crobot, All That Remains, Graveyard.   Five Finger Death Punch is better than St. Vincent or the rest of that hipster shit.   If I had a pair of boots on I would put one up your ass.   Bingo.   Hail Hydra.   Get Scarface on Xbox   Lt. Frank Drebin Police Squad!   r/badmovies   Brainscan! Fuck yeah!   I think Cloud Atlas would be a cult film in a few years. Also, Grandma's Boy.   Trippy visuals.    I got balls of steel and they call me Sparky.   Look at my top post comment history. I have seen and been a part of the craziest fucking shit known.   36 here. Never played Pokmon cause it was for kids when I was 21/22 yrs old. What's really fucked up is when I see people our age play it.   Try Foo Fighters on classic rock stations.   I seen a Mountain Dew X-Box at a pawn shop in West Tennessee few years back. Someone bought it and it's still in the wild.   I used to live in Frayser back in the 90's. I was there recently and it looks like Detroit.  	113
       Doesn't work?   Yes. They even did something similar in TBBT, when Sheldon had to choose between a Xbox One and a PS4.  [Here you go](https://youtu.be/gZA2770_f84?t=3m12s)         Here's a list of all Country Specific YouTube URl's : https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xuNKzdJ3xDazYBusL9Vq_4h31vC3fsidq9ZmZgaKdXg/edit. Hope that helps.    Just watched the first episode and it was amazing. Its sad that they stopped it.    It was set to NSFW automatically I guess, because of mentioning 'NSFW' in the title.    I see that a lot of you face this problem, based on [this earlier post](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/3dhnmo/there_something_seriously_wrong_with_youtube/).  Adding the '/?gl=US' will set your country to US. If you are using the YouTube app instead, just go to the settings and change your country to Worldwide. This should work.    I totally agree with almost everything that you say and I'm a big fan of Kubrick, but I still do not see these two scenes being specifically related in any way. I do not think the writers/directors sat down and thought about connecting these two scenes the way you guys are trying to.   I have watched all the episodes of Mr Robot till now at least 3 times, and I'm in on every single detail. You can check my history if you want. And I still think you are guys thinking about this one way too much, probably become you have been influenced by how smart and well thought out the show has been till now.   If I were to direct these two scenes, I would do them in the exact same way. In the first scene, Elliot is making a big move, taking on something big, which is going to have an impact on his life, and it makes complete sense for him to take this "one last hit". It naturally follows to place the morphine powder as a long single line, to reflect on its significance/scale.    In the last scene, the guys are on their way to the Steel Mountain and its the final cut of the episode. This scene is kinda of cliche in movies and tv shows where a road travel to a destination is involved and the scene is the final cut or cuts to a different scene. It naturally follows to shoot the scene the way it was.   I would not change anything about these two scenes. But to me, all you guys are really doing is, connecting two line segments that make a lot of sense as individual scenes.   There were a lot of great and well thought of scenes in this episode, but I just cannot see the connection you guys are trying to making between these two as one of them.      Ya I got that. I still feel you are guys are thinking way too much about this. The scene where the they give him the "Raspberry Pie" was totally something the writers have put some thought into. But this, I don't think the guys really sat down and thought about this the way you guys are thinking about it.    IMO, this was the best episode yet. So much stuff to absorb that I'll probably have to watch it two more times for it to completely sink in. This show is totally on par with GOT and other amazing shows on my top 5 list.     How are the two even related? Am I missing something?   The 420 one is the only hidden command. The rest are the ones already given :  -help -fsociety -inform -question -wakeup -join and  -420   This is interesting.   	16
 I apologize for any formatting issues because I am on mobile and in the dark, but I wanted to share this with the world before my phone dies, or I do.  I lived in an old house, but I was still surprised when yesterday, rearranging my room while going through things in preparation for college, I found a slit in the wall behind my dresser.  Although I had rearranged things in my room before, I had actually never moved that dresser.     Since it just looked like a dark, solid line, I ran my finger along the slit to make sure it wasnt just a stain or a mark from the dresser being in one spot for so long.  But no, although it felt rather smooth, there was definitely a crack.  I took out my phone and shined the flashlight in there to see if I could see anything.  I could only distinguish vague beams and shapes of what appeared to be an attic-like space.   This was on the wall which faced the hallway, so I went out my bedroom door to investigate.  My room was at the very end of the hallway, with two of my other walls having windows to the outside.  In the hall, directly adjacent to my room, coinciding with where the slit would be, was the hall closet.  I was aware of this, but I opened the hall closet to see about how deep it was.  I went back into my room to compare this with the distance from my doorframe to the slit.  It was pretty close, so it was possible that I was seeing, from the slit, into the space behind the closet, or perhaps just the interior of the wall.     No, I thought.  If it was just the interior of the wall, then the flashlight would have lit it up better, as the backing of the wall would be right there.  In any case, if there was such a space behind the closet, it would have to be quite narrow, as my bedroom closet, with my clothes in it, began about a foot to the left of this slit, and extended to about half the depth of the hall closet.  The closet in my parents bedroom, across the hall, mirrored this, and I presumed that they meet in the middle, behind the closet.  So, there could be no more than a foot of space in between.     I ran my fingers over the slit again, wondering what might have made it, when I felt something at the top.  I had only tentatively touched it before, to see if it was real.  This time, running the length of the slit, I felt a corner at the top.  Shining my light on it, I could barely make out a thin line running to the right for about two and half feet.  It was a door.   This was extremely puzzling, since the hall closet should have occupied half of the space which this doorway would open up to.     Although it was creepy, and mysterious, I was not afraid.  I had read and watched enough horror stories to know that, in any case, I should not open this alone, so I called for my mom.    She came and I showed her the door.  She had to touch it herself to believe it, although, she had never moved that dresser either, since this was the most logical spot along the wall for it to sit, we had never had the need to.  Apparently it, along with a couple of other pieces of furniture had come along with the house.  She had tried to tell the previous owner to keep them, since we had our own bedroom sets, but they had insisted.  Now, she speculated, that this hidden damage to the wall may be the reason.  She wasnt as convinced as I was that it was a door, but decided there was no harm in pulling on it to see if it opens.     Together, we grabbed it from the slit.  Our fingers didnt even fit into the slit, so with what little grip we could get on the door, we had to lean and use our feet for leverage.  Pulling on it like that, there actually seemed to be pressure on the right side, holding it back.  So then, we tried pushing it to the right.  Slowly, but surely, it opened, sliding like a closet door behind the rest of the wall, which was, as we could now see, much thinner than we had realized.  We stepped back and peered into the bare wood and beams of the large, dark, attic-like room.  I shined my flashlight inside.   In the far, left corner, there was an old rocking chair, covered in dust.  The space was only about four feet wide, which was about two feet wider than should have been possible.  Although that could be chocked up to misestimation on my part as to where the hall closet ended in relation to my wall, the depth of the room could not.  It seemed to extend far beyond the hallway, into space which should have been occupied by my parents room.   There also seemed to be a break in the wall to the left.   We werent quite sure what to do.  I had already taken a picture of the doorway and the room, with its impossible proportions.  The next logical step was to go in and investigate.  My mom didnt want me to go in alone, but I knew better than for both of us to go in at once.  The door could close on us and trap us inside.  Thats when I got my brilliant idea.  I could go in with my flashlight, and she could stand in the doorway to make sure it doesnt close, and to watch my back.   Although she didnt feel good about it at first, she reluctantly agreed, and leaned against the right edge of the doorframe, where she could hold the door back if it did, somehow, try to close.     I stepped in with my phone held high, illuminating the floor and room before me.  I felt a rippling draft as I passed through the doorway, but inside, the room, unfinished and exposed though it was, was actually quite warm.      As I stepped in further, I gathered that the heat was coming from an unknown source in the back left corner, where the old, dusty, and empty rocking chair lay.  It was made of an amber colored wood, carved in a simple pattern, and with a dingy navy blue foam cushion sitting on the seat.   I got to the halfway point, and saw, to my left, a gap in the wall about one foot wide.  This was, I presumed, the space between my and my parents bedroom closets.  Although, again, this room seemed deeper than it ought to be, so, although I was halfway across it, I really ought to have been well into my parents room, so it could not have been the space between the closets.  But there it was.  Pitch black.  I shined my flashlight down the narrow way, but the air there was so thick with dust that all the beam did was illuminate the floating particles of dust, and lines of cobwebs, for a few feet, with only dark, vague shapes outlined in the distance.    I turned to the left.  My mom was still in the doorway.  I could see into the light of my room.  Everything was still ok.     I should have left the exploring for later.  We could have put a stopper in the doorway and waited for my dad to get home.    But Id had no reason so far to think anything was wrong.  So far, just heading straight down into the room, I could see my room and my mom, and she could see the old room and me.  If I wanted to check out the narrow gap to my left, however, that would have to change.  But, as long as she was still holding the door, it would be alright.  I was just going to go in a little ways to try and get an idea of how deep it is or if theres anything in there.  I told her so and she nodded ok and just told me to be careful.  I held up my flashlight.  At one foot wide, I had to walk sideways into the gap.  I kept my gaze fixed to the left and the light pointing my way, swatting down cobwebs as I went, slowly.  I had only taken about six steps when I heard an enormous WOOSH and a blood-curdling scream which was cut short by a loud thud.     I backed out of the tiny corridor as quickly as I could while going sideways, and turned to face the door.  Except, it wasnt there.     With the flashlight around eye-level, as Id kept it, I could see only the solid wooden inside of the wall.  I quickly panned the light down the center of the wall.  There was no slit to be seen.   Mom? Incredulously, I stepped closer to where the door should have been.  Mom? There was still no answer.  I continued to call to her in an increasingly louder and more panicked voice as I walked, jogged, then ran the last bit to the wall.  Mom! I screamed as I pounded on the wall.     It had waited until we were separated, until we couldnt see each other, to close the door.  And she had screamed.  Whatever it was must have pushed her out of the way.  I had thought that, if the door were to close on me, it would be by some unseen force, but then, it occurred to me, that it could be some unseen creature.  Did it push her out of the way and leave the confines of this room when she screamed?  Or had it locked itself in here with me?   I was already breathing hard with panic at this point, but when my foot brushed against an object laying against the wall where there previously was none, I jumped back, startled, tripping on the wide-gapped bare floorboards, and landing with my bottom on my leg, facing the opposite corner from whatever Id encountered.  I knew this was bad.  My leg wasnt broken, of that I was fairly certain, but I had to get up slowly because it hurt to move it.  My phone had landed upside down by my feet, shining its narrow beam up at me.  As I picked it up and reflexively flipped it right side up, my eyes widened as the light hit the wet, red, tip of my shoe.   I brought my hand to my forehead to make sure I hadnt cut it.  Being right handed, and having the flashlight in that hand as well, this made the flashlight beam quickly pass over the wall and back to eye-level.  In that quick pass, I had seen hair.  I had not bumped into some invisible thing or unseen object.   I hobbled forward quickly.  My mom must have been unconscious, and she was clearly bleeding.  I needed to wrap something around her head. I had to lean and use my hands on the wall for support, so I could only see the floor and wall right by my feet.  Although I had seen the right side of my mom from the other side of the room, when I got to the corner by the door, I did not see her left, but rather her middle.  The door, in closing, had sliced her clean in half, vertically.  I collapsed in shock, landing on my knees in a pool of blood.  I had asked her to stand in the doorway, and now the right half of her was sealed in this room with me, and the left half of her was in my bedroom outside.  The exact measure that I thought would keep us both safe instead had her cut in half.     After crying there in this agonizing irony of horror and guilt, I started to snap out of the shock and realized that I was locked in this mysterious, physically impossible room, with half the corpse of my mother, and I was kneeling in a pool of her blood.  What if they never find me.  Worst of all, finding half of her, no sign of a break-in, and no me, they might even think I killed her.     I jumped up then, with the adrenaline kicking in helping to work against the pain in my leg, because I also remembered that I had no idea what had closed the door which did kill her, and that I had had my back turned to the rest of the room since it had happened.  I turned around and shined my light into the darkness.  The room, of course, was still empty.  The narrow hall to the left was still dark.  I could still make out the empty rocking chair in the back left corner of the room.  This time, however, the dust had been disturbed into a cloud around it, and it was swinging.    I hope this does not get deleted like /u/M59Gar 's amazing sci-fi story.  This is just my un-edited flow of conclusions in terms of the Multiverse Theory with an afterlife focus, but I wrote it with this community in mind, so....  If this: https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/3duieo/quantum_lottery/   doesn't get deleted, then this here shouldn't either IMO.  Similar subject and slant...      unless you are employed by the state, which would include the prosecuting attorneys, as well as court-appointed defense attorneys, so at least 50% of the time, this may actually be an over-estimate.  It depends on the size of the city.     *spirit.  I am on the mobile site so there is no edit button   The "leave me alone" thing most people have mentioned works most of the time, provided the spirit is not interested in you personally.  It depends on the purpose/nature of the spirit.    Take for example, the situation with my ex.  Shortly after we met, I found out about his ex who had died in a car crash.  This came up after I told him about the lovely dream I had in which at one point a woman I didn't know glared at me and stared me down.  I described her to him, and then he told me about her and that he was worried that would happen, as she had harassed the two girlfriends he'd had since her passing.  I later came to find out that she had been actively haunting him as well.    I'm not going to go into my history or anything beyond the scope of this story, but when I told him I was going to get rid of her, he said his exes had tried and it didn't work.  I don't know what they tried, and there's no need to go over the altercation in detail, because there wasn't much of a confrontation or laughing at her or telling off like you alluded to in your question.  It was more like we both know what we're here for and I'm here to kick your *** out.  On both sides.  The next day when I saw him, he was shocked BC he hadn't seen or heard from her, and apparently didn't think I could get rid of her.    It was then that I realized I had fallen in love with him, because I knew that I wouldn't have had the strength to win that fight otherwise.    That being said, that was a personal matter.  To address your question in a more generic and appropriate way, you cannot just confront a sport, you have to be prepared both in terms of knowing exactly what you're dealing with and in terms of strength and resistance to the challenges and risks the spirit may bring your way.  So, with regards to personal strength, you must first have control of your own thoughts, both so that you can channel your strengths and so that you can tell when someone's trying to mess with your mind.  The basic starting exercise for this is to clear your mind and think of nothing.  The challenge here is control over the urge to fill the silence with "I'm thinking of nothing!" Or thoughts about your breathing.  Once you manage to work past that to where you can clear your mind for a good minute, establishing control over your thoughts (if you're squeamish or weak stomached, this will help you a lot to that end),  You must also, once you have mastered the first, learn how to protect yourself.  If you want to pursue that once you've become master of your own mind, feel free to pm me, or you could post in /r/energywork and ask perhaps about a basic aura shield, although no two people may tell you the same thing.     To recap, to confront a spirit or entity of any kind, you must know exactly what you are up against, as much as possible, have control of your own mind so you can be sharp and know when someone is messing with you, and know most importantly how to defend and protect yourself (to which clearing your mind is a precursor).    Only then, can you prepare the appropriate offensive strategy for the specific encounter.   I also have had recurring dreams about secret rooms.  Usually it was in the back of the closet of my parents bedroom, through a hidden door, and it went up (even though my house is one story).  Orinally, the first time I had a dream involving that place, like 10 years ago, it was just a small simple playroom.  The most recent one I had, in November or December, it was a complicated structure.  It had already become a two-story hideout in previous installments, but this time, during an alien invasion no less, it was incredibly spacious, with an extra secret backroom in the upstairs, behind a dining room, which even contained a closet, and I was hiding there, treating it as a bunker.    If you look at it like any other dream, dreams are generally metaphors which reveal things we either subconsciously observed or picked up on but didn't consciously register, or things we've been thinking about subconsciously but don't want to admit.    Not sure how this applies to recurring dreams about non existent, physically impossible, secret places though.  It depends on the specifics of the dream and your life.  For the ones about your home, it probably signified a desire for something more than your apartment life.

This was actually a good story, and I love the way you started it because I can relate, because I am 10 years older than my brother, but he is on the mild end of the spectrum.  I completely relate to the third parent thing, although now that he's older and talking more, I can actually be more of a sister too.   This January, I had a dream, of the usual menagerie of fantastical nonsense, but then, towards the end, my mom told me we needed to go to WalMart to return a pack of socks.  We went and waited in line and everything.    When I woke up in the morning, guess what my mom told me we needed to do?  Except, in the dream, the socks were white.  In real life, the socks were black.  But that's irrelevant.    That was the most direct precognitive dream I've ever had.  I've had many, but its always not exactly the same thing, more metaphorical, or similar but not identical.   This is the first and only time so far that I've dreamed something and had it happen *exactly* that way.  And it was also about socks......   Maybe socks are some sort of key to the future. :)   sounding like your father could either make it a dead relative or something malicious trying to trick you.  There's also the question of whether the thing making the voices and the blue man are one in the same.  If not, then the first, talking spirit, may be attached to a family object that you moved with, and the second, blue spirit, may be attached to the new house, since it didn't appear until you moved.  If they are one in the same, it highlights the question of why did they leave you alone until your brother grew old enough to walk and talk and be understood?  If its a dead relative, maybe it wants to send a message to your father by scaring his young children?  maybe someone who didn't approve of the marriage?  other than that, I have no idea.    did you take anything from the first house when you moved that was not yours before then, meaning that you found in the house (and you as in the whole family).  because if its not attached to a family item, the other explanation for following you would be that you happened to take the item it is attached to from the other house.    Scratching the center of the basement made me think something was buried under the old house, but if that were the case, the spirit wouldn't have followed you to a new house.  so that is not likely the case.   that's good to know.   I'm American and I've only ever had frozen ones, and I thought they were amazing.   ouch, yeah at least the only thing I lost was some money.  That was a costly enough mistake that I'll be certain not to make it again.   well if he was in a collage (and thus, presumably in a magazine), that would not be as much of a fuckup maybe   when I read the title I was thinking what kind of hole puncher can go through earphones, but then I realized you meant the cord   witnesses   America.  racial profiling is rampant.   am I the only one who thinks its weird that the excuse he gave his grandma was that he had girls in there?  I mean, I'm assuming op's a grown man, but normally that's what you try for your grandma not to think.   I dont bike so I didnt know what a kickstand for a bike looks like, so I made the mistake of googling it https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=bike+kickstand rlz=1C1CHFX_enUS600US600 source=lnms tbm=isch sa=X ei=8MFuVeCRHq6M7AbC7YGICw ved=0CAgQ_AUoAg biw=1366 bih=643   it's not your fuck up, it's your mom's.  It's a good thing that everyone found out, really.  They say ignorance is bliss, and it could have been, but for one, your lives would be a lie, two, your dad needed to know the truth, three, even though she did a really bad thing, your mom is also no longer under the pain and strain of keeping that secret.    In the long run, you did everyone a favor.   The fact that she broke down like that over a simple genetics conversation means that she was having trouble holding it together in the first place.  Also, better now while you're all still fairly young instead of finding out later in life and possibly destroying the entire family irreperably (as there'd be no obligation to stick together, and also more years of lies).  edit: oh, and also your sister deserves to know her true identity.  Your father raised her and is still her dad to her and hopefully always will be on his end.  But it's a good thing for her to find out who her biological father is if she wants to; at least she has the opportunity.   yess! I was thinking the same thing   no don't wish more on him   so I spent the semester here in the UK, and I was supposed to be going home to the states today, but I woke up 45 minutes after my bus to the airport had left, and there was no way for me to get to the airport in time for my flight.  I overslept because I didn't remember until late last night that I had to print my ticket for said bus to the airport, so I had to go up to the uni to do so, and got back around 2:15am.  I shouldn't have gone to sleep at all.  As a result, I had to have the ticket changed for Friday, and I paid more to change the ticket than I did for the ticket originally.  Pretty costly fuckup.   parts of this installment, the prisoner's story, remind me of John Dies At the End.  With the bugs...   to an extent: Pumped up Kicks     apparently it will take me about 4 hours to read hitchhiker's, although that, again, may be slowed by scifi terminology and worldbuilding   I stand corrected; it is working when you search by ISBN, but not by title, so one must google the title to get the isbn first.  This may be an easier and more important feature to integrate into your code, to google the isbn first and then plug it into amazon.   the tool you linked to for measuring reading speed and comprehension was good to know (even if it just wants to sell software in the end).  (I got 242 wpm and 100% accuracy, for the curious).  Anyway, the amazon results are definitely not working on your site, as per your notice.  They are not working at all.    I hope you get it fixed soon. Although, I realize now that it's really just a calculator which does the searching and calculation in one step.    Reading speed varies though with each book.  Especially the next novel on my list, Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.  Scifi terminology and names slow reading down a bit, not as much as academic writing, but enough to matter over the course of an entire book.  That being said, your tool can be improved beyond being just a calculator if you measure the reading speed in house (rather than through someone else's link).    This would be the same sort of division, with a start and stop timer button.  Coding for that should actually be simpler than what you have set up (as you're not pulling info from another site).  But there's no point in re-inventing the wheel, unless you can improve it.   To make your reading speed calculator better than that on readingsoft, you can have a couple different samples of text, for different genres, which the user would select based on the book they intend to read.    You can have a generic info one like the one on reading soft, a scifi/fantasy passage, a historical/biographical passage, and an academic passage.  (or a slightly different assortment if you have a better ideas).  These should produce different speeds, which would make for more accurate time estimates depending upon the material.  Another option would be to pull a preview passage from Amazon for the books for which such is available.  Using a passage from the actual book would be really cool, and would be a perfect measurement.   That would be some complex code, but people would really like it.  If you're not making money on it though, that would be too much trouble.  Which is why I suggested a small selection of stock passages instead.  Good luck!   I think it's cool that this is happening to so many of you guys.  Just so long as it doesn't start happening *with* people; that could be problematic...   continuity error in your brain.   When we develop mentally, as children, we gain the ability to understand that the world continues without us.  That things will not always be in the last place we left them, that the teacher did not stand in the classroom doorway from when school let out to the next morning coming back in.  Prior to achieving that understanding, however, a child is easily baffled by such continuity errors which occur when things are not as he or she left them.  Nothing to do with intelligence, but rather, perception and theory of mind, perhaps your sleep addled brain experienced such a continuity error, having fallen asleep with your arm like that, and truly believed it still should have been like that.  Especially if, like /u/spreggo suggested, if your arm was asleep, then you didn't get the sensory cues that it was laying flat, so your mind (as it is apt to do) filled in the missing information of your arm's location with the assumption that it should be where it last was.  Basis: my psychology education   they probably don't..... if you subscribe to that theory, we are one of many, so they probably don't all come here...   well universes aren't empty.  I don't believe in the swtiching universes thing personally, but the idea is that the person avoided their death by moving into an alternate reality.  The reality isnt populated entirely by people who experienced that.  The realities exist adjacent to eachother.  We were already here, as may have been another version of /u/Stadamus .   That's England for you I guess.  I'm not in London, but my first day of class this term, on my way back home from the bus stop, I fell and scraped myself up pretty bad.  I thought I would probably get robbed since my things were all over the floor, but on the contrary.  Someone driving by *pulled over* to see if I was ok and help me up.  That was just so unexpected.    when I saw the flairs in the sidebar before I read this, I thought they were added for the poster to mark whether it was a small, medium, large, or xtra large fuck up :)   I kind of agree.  If it seems to be loving (although you can't be 100% sure), you don't want to be the one to escalate it to violence (although stalkers usually do so on their own).  The best thing to do with a spirit or entity of any kind is to attempt to be nice to it (and maybe kindly ask it to back down) until it shows other intentions.   the title is wrong though, she is missing...   hmm, then I would say you're just more sensitive to it or actively aware of sensing it.  The someone behind you thing, and things like the facebook thing, are subtle things that just subconsciously register.  The difference then is that you're consciously noticing the signals.    Just my inference   the first one to actually keep me up was room 733, because I read it at 2am in my dorm room.  I stayed up until 5 that night   The hearing things fall but nothing being on the floor or anything happens with some regularity at my house as well.  Also usually in the kitchen, when no one is in there.     the fact that its usually mischevious stuff, and happened as well in your own home as a child, makes it sound like its not a doppleganger so much as a spirit playing practical jokes. I wouldn't be concered about it being sinister, since its been happening for so long with no danger. But the part for a machine is a bit concerning. As well as the computer doing things in your name that it should not be able to. If it escalates into more dangerous territory (edited medical records, someone seeing you tinkering with the engine on a forklift, etc) then it may be time to get some kind of help (and I don't mean mental help). Although, you might have blackouts, as a more "rational" explanation. Can you account for your entire day on your floor? Are you sure?   the "coffin" is definitely the head of the figure, drawn out from the motion of the shot.  As for the figures themselves, \_()_/   of course; trying too hard with anything of this nature ultimately sets you up for failure or self-delusion.  	46

 Just got back from a special screening that AMC did where they sent me two free tickets. First I will say that right before the movie began, I checked the ratings and saw it was at 54% on RT. Disappointing so my hopes were not high.  But that movie was amazing. The raw emotion that Jake showed was extremely intense the entire film. This was not a movie about boxing, it was a movie about an emotional journey of a man.  As the trailer spoils, Rachel McAdams dies. This happens pretty early in the film and the rest is a semi-poorly written script on his downward spiral and redemption. While I was not a fan of the writing, Rachel and Jake both shined bright.  If you've been watching the new True Detective season, you've seen a side of Rachel McAdams that she hasn't shown before. This is another. Rachel's character is an extremely realistic, semi-trashy girl who plays the part perfectly. When she shrugs when Jake looks at her in between rounds in the first match, it portrays a girl who grew up with Jake's character and does not love, but lives with his career out of necessity. She never celebrates the huge money but clearly enjoys it, nearly to a fault. The way she played the character was perfect for the background they gave.  As for Jake, it was a brilliant performance. The way he acted in Rachel's death scene was perfect. While the death itself was not particularly realistic, Rachel's reaction and the way Jake held her and talked to her was more realistic than I've ever seen in any movie. It showed the pure fear he had for losing someone he'd grown up with. It showed how much he depended on her. It made me shed a few tears.  Jake's character was played as a hyper-emotional, dumb kid, who grew up in the foster system. He nailed it at every turn. Meeting his new boxing trainer, perfect. Frustration with his comeback, perfect. Dealing with his daughter in uncharted territory, perfect. He truly got into this character's head and the dedication to his work was evident. He lived and breathed this character every second of the film.  This was a character that Jake had never played before. While I thought his worst performance was Source Code, where he didn't show much at all, he added another masterful performance to his collection here. Between Nightcrawler, Enemy, Prisoners, End of Watch, Zodiac, Jarhead, Brokeback Mountain, Bubble Boy, Donnie Darko, October Sky, and now Southpaw, Jake Gyllenhaal is truly one of the most versatile actors of our generation. It is truly a pleasure to see him perform- especially when we have actors who play basically the same character at every turn (Michael Cera, Liam Neeson, Kevin Hart, Melissa McCarthy, etc.).  My biggest gripe in the movie was probably that he literally was a southpaw fighter for one second of the entire film, and the lone reference to being a southpaw was of no significance whatsoever. But if you're not a big fight fan, you likely wouldn't notice that anyway.  If I could rate a movie just on the raw performance of the lead actor, I'd give it a 10/10. Unfortunately the writing was weak and some of the secondary characters were weak/underdeveloped (the random extra death, 50 Cent's performance and Forest Whitaker to an extent), so I'll give the movie an overall 6.5/10.   Like what? We can torture them if they commit a crime?   What about it? The article you responded with does not provide a national total.   The article you are referencing uses another article as its source. In that source article, it demonstrates this 40+ point lead in only Nevada and Colorado, specifically noting that Hillary's lead is not as big in either North Carolina or Florida.   This poll is for Nevada only, where Hispanics/Latinos make up 27% of the population. Source: http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/32000.html  Aka, this is near meaningless, unless you can think of some reason you should extrapolate the results nationwide.   Why in the world did you answer the door when the cop knocked?   I always hear tons of anecdotal evidence but I'll wait for a poll from your state before judging.   Please reconcile the differences.   So you're ok with killing those with low IQ, those in prison, and unwanted kids in general?   You should read up on the term "anchor babies."   To put it in perspective:  The closest states, by percentage vote, between Democrat and Republican, in the 2012 election:  North Carolina- R  Florida- D  Ohio- D  Virginia- D  These are the true "toss-up" states. Every other state was more than 5 percentage points apart.  To put this in perspective, the Democrat for 2016 can lose every single one of those states and still achieve the 270 votes necessary. So basically, Virginia is decently important, only if the Republicans make some headway on the more solidly Democratic states, including Colorado, Pennsylvania, New Hampshire, or Iowa (and it just gets more unrealistic from there).    Wait, so you're saying you're ok with killing unwanted people?   They can be punished appropriately now. There is nothing about how recent a decision came down that says that it need not be followed. As soon as it can be reasonably interpreted by the county, it needs to be followed. This, historically, means less than a week, which we are long past.   You have to look at not just the lawfulness of the situation but the reality of the situation.  The reality is, any clerk who denies marriage certificates to gay couples is likely in an area where they are surrounded by like minded people. This person will not get fired immediately because who will the person denied complain to? The clerk's boss, who may say too bad? The person denied will have to hire a lawyer and file an action against the county.  Contrast this with the reality of your Muslim clerk. What are you picturing? A Muslim who is surrounded by non-Muslims? In such a case, the woman would complain to the clerk's boss and the person would be quickly fired. However, if surrounded by like-minded Muslims, the exact same thing as the first scenario would play out.  Your premise is picturing two different situations. The bottom line is, if clerks are surrounded by like-minded people, it will likely take attorney action. If not surrounded by like-minded people, the boss will quickly correct the action. It really has nothing to do with being against gay marriage/Muslims, other than the fact that one is more prevalent in our country.   Just FYI, you guys are planning on committing a couple felonies including false imprisonment and possibly another by refusing him to seek help (impeding his ability to call 911, which he may try to do if he feels threatened).   Entry.  Pls win.   Medi-Cal is usually retroactive for a certain period, I believe 3 months.   You know I was going to say Executive Order, but the more I think I about it, the more that it's almost an entirely private issue.  Sure, the President could order that all government entities convert to metric, but private companies would still provide both conversions due to demand. I reckon it would take multiple decades for the private companies to switch over after the government.   There was an article the other day posted on /r/TrueReddit where there were 2 sets of identical twins accidentally switched at birth in a South American country. One family was middle class in the city and the other was rural poor. Very interesting article.   You would like Naked and Afraid.  It's usually a 2 person team and they each get to bring an item (usually choose firestarter and machete), and they have to survive for 21 days completely on their own.  They recently started a show of the best survivors, called Naked and Afraid XL, where it's for 40 days and consists of 4 teams of 3 each, and by the previews it looks like the groups find each other in later episodes.   Weeds was the only one. I loved that show and how they mixed up the opening song.   The question is: of the support she does receive, who gives more than 50%?  If she truly receives no support then give her a dollar and she can legally use your and her wife's tax returns instead.   The closest analogy I could make is PPV where the providers typical take a 50% cut. Not exactly the answer you were looking for, but just to give you an idea.   It's worth noting that the test is which parent provides more than 50% support to the child, not who the child lives with more than 50% of the time. Small, but notable difference.   That is fraud. It's a low likelihood but possible that the school could ask for verification.   Same! I've had this on my list for awhile and was very disappointed to see no theater release or any promotion whatsoever.   You can't. I was in this situation where my parents kicked me out of the house midway through my senior year in high school, and when I applied for financial aid, I couldn't because my parents would not let me see their tax return.  I applied for an independent override at my school but was denied because I didn't meet their very strict requirements- including physical abuse by a parent with corroborating police reports. In short, it's not gonna happen in your situation, given what you've described.  What I did was wait until the year I turned 23, when you get automatic independent status.  What your kid can do is community college in the meantime that does not require loans.   I'm unsure why guillotine is never mentioned.

I believe it should only be used in specific cases of absolute certainty.   High quality video, hundreds of witnesses, and DNA evidence. Think Columbine. How is certainty of guilt invalid?   Fully expected Omar   Oh wow I'm not in /r/mma   I hate the radio commercials I hear 5 times a day about how we need to scream louder, cheer harder, blah blah blah.  It's like a girlfriend threatening to leave unless you buy her stuff and your friend going "oh dude you better do everything you can to get her to stay." Screw that, if you're gonna threaten to leave unless I do something then I'd rather be single. What poor ownership of the team.   Was the dog found in the University Heights area?   I'll let an actual lawyer specializing in landlord-tenant law answer but to me, as a law student working in an office that deals with mostly property law, all charges look legitimate to me.  Definitely request an itemized invoice and copies of receipts for work performed, but I doubt the fact that he was maybe a day late or didn't provide those before you requested them would give you the right to not be responsible for any portion of the damages.   Besides Barao, at HW, Noguiera unsuccessfully defended his interim belt against Mir when he could have fought the actual title holder (Couture), who lost to Brock, who fought Mir at UFC 100 to unify the titles.      Yea I'm not sure how that would play into it. I just remember that I had a friend who lost one parent and his surviving parent received a good chunk of change until he was 18. Let alone 3 kids with both parents dying.   It's not after the victim speaks up, it's after they turn 18. So if the statute of limitations is 7 years and the abuse ends when the kid is 12 then he/she has 15 years to have charges filed by the DA.   Have you looked into getting social security benefits for the kids since their parents died?  Children are usually entitled to such benefits until 18.   Other people gave you advice on the bill, but for the insurance I can tell you if you need to go on Medicaid or the exchange if you tell me your annual income.   Maybe he is just never around mirrors. Maybe he's a vampire and doesn't want to be known. Someone put a mirror in front of him next time they meet him.   Was BJ at the airport too?   I'm kidding, that's actually pretty cool. What did he say about the fight?   So let's say you, as a gay man, is on a road trip. You try to buy gas at the town you stop in because you're near empty. The gas station, and every other, refuses to serve you.  Ok so you call up a tow truck to get your car towed to the next town. That person, and every other tow truck service in town refuse to serve you.  So you're getting hungry, but every single restaurant/grocery store refuses to serve you.  Well you'll just go sleep somewhere and figure it out tomorrow. But the only hotel in town refuses to serve you.  This is a world you want to live in?   HIPAA   Whooooo! Bought time.   Yea, I keep refreshing thinking I'm missing it, but it still says standby.   I mean I totally see where you're coming from. I thought both were extremely close.   Look at the strike differential for Rory in the 1st. Also, the 4th was Rory's pretty solidly in the beginning and Lawler didn't hit back as hard in the later parts of the round.  I'm not saying it was clear cut, but I think both Rory edges both rounds.   I'm sorry, I forgot the rules since I never post threads. I just deleted it but it's still showing.   Ah I see. Those threads get too hard to read for me unless you sort by New, but then it screws up the rest of reddit until you change it back.   So do they put Conor/Aldo on 190 in 3 weeks or 191 in 8 weeks?  I think they could make 190, but barely. On the other hand, do Aldo and Conor really want to go through all that press again for 8 more weeks? I guess Dana will tell us in the post fight press conference.   Who the hell thinks that was early? Chad was done, and that coming from someone who hates Conor.   Conor's cardio is unreal. Like how did he take that wrestling for 2 rounds, with punches peppered in there, then stand up with cardio looking like he just started the fight? Especially with that weight cut.  It was the cardio that won Conor the fight, hands down. All bets are off for favoring Aldo now, and I'm a Conor hater and huge fan of Aldo.   IM BETTING GOLD FOR A YEAR. I GOT MENDES. PUT UP OR SHUT UP MCGREGOR FANS.  Edit: I admit. I was wrong. Glad nobody was confident enough to bet it.      Do you have any proof of this deal? Emails? Texts? Witnesses?   Do you have a contract?   I'm not sure if they do at Hooters, but they definitely show the prelims at Buffalo Wild Wings.   I actually caught a card there and met some pretty cool guys so good suggestion.   I moved here about a year ago and have been super busy with school so I haven't made many friends, let alone ones who watch MMA.  I usually drag my girlfriend to watch the big cards at Buffalo Wild Wings, but she has a big test coming up and won't go and I don't want to sit at home by myself and watch a card this big.  So anyone nearby?!  Bonus points if you realize Mendes is gonna wrestlefuck McGregor so I don't have to argue with you the whole time.   Girls.   I mean almost every champ is top 10 p4p...   No, I don't want to try to remember a bet for over a year. Propose this to me next year in October and I'll take it.   You can't just use your grandparents for no reason. If OP's cousin lives with her parents then her parents must file taxes for The cousin to use FAFSA.   50%   Not OP, but I think Hillary takes the exact same electoral votes and a more dominant percentage, around 54%.  The main difference will show in Florida where Hillary will win more seniors than Obama did.   I see a bunch of answers that do not QUITE answer what I perceive your question, OP.  So here's what would happen, despite how unlikely. First, as others have said the amendment cannot be unconstitutional by definition if it passes. But let's say it passed and SCOTUS said it WAS unconstitutional. Well then according to them, the amendment is invalid. However, it seems likely that the Executive branch would be unlikely to enforce such a decision because of the overwhelming support.  It really comes down to the fact that each govt entity only has as much power as its people bestow upon it.   More like:  You: "Hey what's your name again?"  Him: "You don't know my name?"  You: "No, uh, I meant your last name."  Him: "Oh. It's Smith."  You: "Ok, uh, bro, Mr. Smith..."   Obviously I was referring to the fact that they do not enforce by not arresting along their set guidelines while reserving the right to arrest and prosecute where they please.  Now if you will answer my question instead of going around it, WHAT IF the federal govt refuses to enforce any law?   The rule I've heard from advisors is that LSAT counts for 50% of your app, GPA is 49% and everything else, including school difficulty, work experience and extracurriculars are 1%.   Ok but your argument has one problem. The executive branch HAS stopped enforcing federal law on marijuana. How have they achieved that in your view?  Now, since the executive branch is tasked with enforcing the legislative branch and judicial branch's laws, what do you suppose happens if they refuse, as they are doing on the subject of marijuana?   Nothing. The President could order any part of the govt to stop enforcing any law. As a society, we give legitimacy to the govt by accepting its role. If we recognize the role of the executive branch as enforcers with the power to stop enforcing laws as they see fit, then that is a legitimate political end.   Just visit the Army/Navy/Airforce/Marines/Coast Guard website and I'm sure there will be a button for a recruiter to contact you.   I never said they created the law. My contention is that their decisions are interpretations of the law and that majority opinions are the supreme law of the land.   Ultimate lawyer answer. I love it.   You'd have to ask the founders of our country. My guess would be judicial economy.   I reject your premise. My contention is that SCOTUS is allowed to do anything, yes, even an infringement on the rights of others.  SCOTUS decisions ARE the law and therefore everything they write in majority opinions are their lawful interpretation of the Constitution. So you cannot say they can make any decision that is unlawful. Again, I cite to Marbury v. Madison for this contention.   Not according to my argument. If you tell me why it's flawed, I'll respond accordingly.   Lol. I'm aware how the decisions are made. I was merely saying that they could have been made on any day of the past weeks or next week and it was definitely on purpose that Kennedy released his third opinion on the matter on the anniversary.      YES! If a majority opinion of the Supreme Court says something is so, then legally it is the supreme law of the land. That's how our country works! See Marbury v. Madison for context of this phenomenon.  Also I'm fine removing the word "implied" because it does not LIMIT the text of the 10th Amendment, whereas your adding of the word explicitly does limit the text. I'll cite to the Necessary and Proper Clause to show that our Constitution grants implied powers.   So you would be denying someone the right to marry based on their gender? Eve can marry Adam, but Steve cannot marry Adam, and thus Steve would be denied the same rights as Eve, based on his gender. Thus, since gender discrimination should not be allowed, same sex marriage should be allowed.   What about before the Loving decision? The previous 100 years or so had said that interracial couples did not have the right to marriage. So you can see why basing your argument merely on the fact that most of our history was against it is flawed. Unless you are also contending that interracial marriage should be not allowed?   I believe the language was appropriate in light of the decision bring a landmark in American history. It wasn't the first to use cute language and certainly won't be the last.  And to be honest, that type of language does not matter at all. When we study cases in class, they only leave the relevant parts and cut out 90% of the text that reiterates or is useless in changing the previous status quo. Only a very small portion of future lawyers and legislators in America will even read the flowery portions of the opinion. Not to mention how salty his dissent was. Why is he allowed to use unprofessional language and not the majority?   You are factually incorrect. To quote the text of the 10th Amendment: "The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people."  It says nothing about the powers not EXPLICITLY granted to the federal govt being reserved for the states. Therefore, any implied powers are also reserved for the federal govt. Since the power to regulate marriage on the basis of sex has been implied by the majority opinion today, it is therefore deemed to have been one of the powers of the federal govt since the 14th Amendment passed, on which the decision is based.   I've read the opinion and it only mentions that states are required to grant marriages and recognize them. It explicitly leaves out territories, and unlike the recent healthcare decision, it seems that there is no intent to include anything beyond the text.  However, I am only a law student and unfamiliar if SCOTUS decisions normally apply to the states and territories.   It is implied, as are numerous other rights. The Right to Privacy is also not explicitly stated in the Constitution. Would you argue that citizens do not have the Right to Privacy?   I agree and would contend that this is a fundamental right that has been wrongfully denied to same sex couples from the passage of the 14th to 2003.   For the record I'm in law school now and actually right in the middle of taking my Constitutional Law course this Summer.  I think it's very fair to summarize as 14th v. 10th. The hard part about the justices wrapping their heads around saying that gay marriage is legal is that they are not granting new rights but merely interpreting the Constitution as saying that these rights were granted when the 14th Amendment was passed and are merely being recognized now.  I just finished reading the majority and the dissents and in one of the dissents, I think it was Scalia's, the author says that by interpreting the 14th Amendment as granting the rights of gay marriage, the majority is contending that they see something that every past SCOTUS justice has missed in the past and how insulting it is to those past great justices. The author then goes on to list these great justices and how by finding that this right exists, every state from the passage of the 14th to 2003, a total of 135 years has been missing this right.  This is a somewhat disingenuous argument as justices can only judge the cases in front of them, and I am not aware of any cases regarding the rights of same sex couples to marry until very recently. And so, these justices have not missed this interpretation as it was never presented to them. The states however, have missed this interpretation. At that comes in the 10th Amendment. Since it is generally understood that states regulate marriage, it seemed natural that they would determine who could participate in such institution. However, they did not anticipate that this interpretation would be an infringement of civil rights.  Therefore, I believe you are correct in saying that because the states believe they have the rights to regulate marriage from the 10th Amendment, but SCOTUS has stepped in and said that when there is an infringement of civil rights, the 14th rules. And by the fact the federal law overrules state law, it is lawful for SCOTUS to interpret the Constitution to bestow these rights of marriage upon all citizens.   I definitely think this was done on purpose. It could have been issued yesterday or Monday with other opinions.   I read an article talking about how this still happens in the US, usually exactly how you described it- rich families in rural areas having foreigners be literal slaves.  Here's a link to report this to the FBI, you just click the Submit a Tip on Crime button at the bottom and fill out the form: https://m.fbi.gov/#https://www.fbi.gov/about-us/investigate/civilrights/human_trafficking  Further, here's an article to read on the matter, if you're interested: https://m.fbi.gov/#https://www.fbi.gov/news/stories/2008/may/humantrafficking_050908   Maybe look up the closest campground. They're usually cheap and all you need is a tent.   I don't really agree with that since he was one minute away from winning 2/3 hardest fights (Anderson 1 and Jones) and he dominated the first round of the other one (Anderson 2).   I'm actually buying this.   A third place win?   Foakes v. Beer!!!! Law school has finally paid off!   You're convincing the wrong person. The average person will see over and over that Bernie is a self-described socialist and that will be it.   I see this all the time on reddit, but I truly do not believe he is electable in the general. I have not seen any polls of Sanders vs Republican candidates so I base this instead on statistical evidence showing that 50% of Americans refuse to elect a Socialist (http://www.gallup.com/poll/183713/socialist-presidential-candidates-least-appealing.aspx).  Now I love Sanders' viewpoints and think he'd make a great president. But he openly says he is a socialist, and looking at the evidence shows America is not ready for a socialist president.  Therefore, I say that if I voted for Sanders in the primary, and others do as well, he may win, and therefore likely lose the general election. Thus, I will vote for Clinton because that is the avenue most likely to not have a Republican president. I look at the lesser of evils. While I am not so fond of Clinton, I view a potential Republican president as far worse.   Fair enough.   To be honest, I only read about it in here. I have no idea if it exists either. I was basing my statements on the assumption that it does exist.   Whatever. I vote for whichever candidate I feel will do the least harm.   At least 30-40%. There are many many people who have no idea that he even exists.   I based my statement purely on statistical evidence from polls indicating that those who know both Clinton and Sanders favor Sanders. While it is possible this will not extrapolate to the population as a whole, I believe Sanders' positions are more favorable to the average American and thus that if he had the same recognition as Clinton he would win.  	106
 The Birds, I hear it was terrifying when it first came out but it's hilarious to watch now.    https://youtu.be/AbK6CUB4MJs   The movie is on the above link, the character I think is David Cross comes in at about 42:15. IMDB and Wikipedia have no mention of the character on either Cross' page or the movie's.   It makes sense for it to be him; 1994 is when he was just beginning his career and they casted the cheapest actors they could. Also, he seems like the kind of guy who would enjoy making fun of his own mistakes, as they did in season 4 of Arrested Development. Thoughts? Can anyone find proof of who this actor is?

    I love this. Reminds me of the JFK quote about being a liberal.   "If by a "Liberal" they mean someone who looks ahead and not behind, someone who welcomes new ideas without rigid reactions, someone who cares about the welfare of the people-their health, their housing, their schools, their jobs, their civil rights and their civil liberties-someone who believes we can break through the stalemate and suspicions that grip us in our policies abroad, if that is what they mean by a "Liberal", then I'm proud to say I'm a "Liberal.   this is a little excessive, but I think the point that u/MrFactualReality is trying to make is that Bernie has stood by his policies for his entire career. He marched on Washington with MLK, he has fought for LGBT rights since the seventies, he was/is against the Iraq War, he is against TPP. Sanders stands by his views and does not flip-flop. I think Hillary with TPP is what definitely sold me on Bernie, she took awhile to respond to it (and still has not?), while Bernie came out against it since the whole debate started. I also see her more as a moderate than Bernie, which is why Bernie appeals to me more, as I am more of a progressive. One last point, the whole 2 billion dollar fundraising goal by Hillary is not something I am a fan of. I think these are the points that u/MrFactualReality was trying to make, but was taking a much more rash stance against her.   is this not a form of doxxing, and thus illegal?   black glove Ray is the best.  	5

    People make the argument that it is okay that the information was leaked because swingers/poly peoples' SOs already know the information, so it is okay. I'm sorry I misunderstood your post. I'm not upset, nor was I was trying to "shit on" your post; quite the opposite.

    And this happened  100 years ago.    Well my folks lived in Chicago and woolworths lunch counter was whites only. In Chicago.    Haven't seen but listened to the audio and she does not want to exit her car. The cop forced her to do so. The whole thing reeks.    Apparently.    This. If you don't have the nose to immediately remove your kid, you're selfish. I'm a parent of a young child and have only had to threaten to leave a place once, did not have to follow throu because he got his shit together. My nephew is the opposite and throws tantrums like they're knives. He's been removed and even I think his folks wait too long. It's fucking rude.    Oh horseshit.       That's just a rumer.             Yikes. I walked in on my folks once, but never them on me.    It was the boogers, wasn't it.          She's right. All her detractors and folks calling her naiive - seriously, check yourself. Talk about privilege. Whew. She's doing what she can to better the world after being gunned down by a backward fundie for attempting to be educated!    I heard one commentator say, these are often illiterate and poor fundies with brand new automatic weapons. Stop the flow of weapons, get the guns away from them, and it will be a start. They have so much money and weaponry, that's what is allowing them to flourish. Or rather spread like a virus.    Doublespeak or brain damage, or a combo. It's like GW Bush's Clean Air act, or the GOP's family values platform. Actually, the GOP and ISIS are two peas in a pod; the GOP has the global arms trader the NRA as a sponsor. Buddies forever.    Blah blah blah NRA blah blah blah    It's the NRA astroturfers. In reality, the majority of America is tired of the gun terrorism and the blood spilled every day. Not sure how much of it is covered in international press. It's abhorrent. Six toddlers this week were killed in America by guns.  From Women Against Gun Violence's facebook page: 6th TODDLER SHOT THIS WEEK: A 3-year-old boy is in critical condition after shooting himself in the head with his grandfather's gun. The loaded gun had been left on the nightstand next to the bed where the toddler was napping. This is the sixth child, 4 and under, to be shot this week. http://ow.ly/PeMUA   American here, and I'm happily surprised at the lack of Ted nugent all over the place in here.    They've been civil for ages.    http://www.kansascity.com/news/article18291908.html            Detectives said it appeared the loaded pistol had been left on the nightstand next to the bed. If true, detectives said the grandparents could face a misdemeanor charge of making a firearm accessible to a child.  The charge can result in a fine and up to a year in jail.         Stout sista here too               This incident is not the first time that news crews have been targeted in the Bay Area.

As a long-time user I don't know if I just subscribe to the wrong subs or what, but it seems to have become a bastion of shills for corporate, fracking and guns.  Misogyny and racism abound.       I'm donating to Bernie monthly. I am furious but unsurprised at the media stonewalling him. All the more reason. Vote him in.    Six year olds also need to follow rules!!!            Yeah, the air conditioned WASP nests.    I worked at a large print shop for years. They eliminated the QC department and later sold to an investment group. They repeatedly cut the workers and added on more and more executives. I imagine nowadays it's all upper management and nobody there to actually do the fucking jobs.    Ugh! The pain :(   Oh he knew. :)   He picked the WRONG tea party to attend!    No bueno, eh Trumpsta?       The poor state with no access to healthcare, infant mortality rates akin to Somalia, and so many deaths by gun each day that they make counting and studying the violence illegal!    Exactly. This is why there is a huge pushback against the open carry terrorists. Nobody wants to be gunned down while living our lives.   Lol! That's hilarious. Not worrying about people walking around with death machines, when we lose so many globally per day to such dangerous weaponry. Absolutely idiotic stance you've got there.    It's just Rick Perry on the lookout for coyotes. Furry or human.    Yep. It's what the Open Carry buffoons are aiming for, so to speak.    Yemen, and Texas. Hard to tell sometimes.       Holy shit. I had no idea Boulder was so bad on vaccination. That is horrible.    As a woman, I cannot support such an anti-woman candidate as Rand Paul.

No, that's /r/games. /r/gaming would taste like a picture of cold pizza and coke.    Eventually they won't be able to pay someone to C D that 3D remake of Chrono's Trigger.       That was in No Country for Old Men.    I like the silent movie cartoon style showing of the artist's hand.       He would have been almost alone then. Pretty sure critics tore this movie a new one back in the day.    Whiskey or no sale!   I'm still holding on to my belief that this whole Star Wars thing will never catch on.    Isn't the point of this supposed to be that the guy is judged differently on the basis of his looks? What's the point of showing different women?    Okay, in this book I'm working on I have character A and B. They're sisters. A is a button down, rule-following, reliable salt of the earth type who works the family garden, and B is a more devil may care, adventurous one and the parents tolerate it because in her adventures she has made the family more money than her sister. Both of them want to leave home but the outside world is too big and scary since their village is surrounded by vast jungle and on the other side of that are strange communities. One day there is a huge crisis in the village and in the end, both of them are instrumental in saving the day.   Which sounds more interesting as a postscript:   A. Characters A   B, having proven to themselves that they're up to facing the dangers of life head on and left their family with enough money to get by without them, plunge into the largely unknown darkness seeking new sights, new experiences, etc. Character B is more outspoken in her enthusiasm while B is more quietly excited.   B. Character A finds that now that she's experienced real danger, she's more of an adrenalin junkie than her sister, who learns that real danger isn't as much fun as the trouble she used to get in. So  Character A wants to set out on this adventure and Character B goes along to look out for her sister and to not look like a coward.   Thank you for your time    Did Frozen get rereleased?    Credit to /u/usedthrone for the title.       How early can a fetus be aborted and still have its fetal tissue be usable? Is that a situation where the tissue is more usable early on?   Such a ninja.    I wouldn't get along with anyone if I was stuck in a bucket in the desert or wearing a heavy plastic casing.    And people doubted the effectiveness of abstinence only education!   Damn. He forgot to bring the cow.    I don't get the pun.    Or very badly abused, but that's just speculation.       For double price, Lynch will provide a commentary track where he explicitly says what everything means.    Oh. Thought this was that normalpornfornormalpeople stuff.    So, are you in a sem-rural area?  I am, and the library I work at still has people checking out the VHS tapes. It's amazing to me.    The shit you could get away with when you didn't need to bother with sound on the day.    Inspired by this joke: https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/3d5m8z/backstreet_boys_and_nsync_members_are_apparently/ct29g5a?context=3  Anyway, if the sacrifices to keep the "Gods" happy affect every country in CitW, they can effect every religion. Different types of religious/supernatural figures are featured in the movie and various supernatural means are used to defeat the monsters that get unleashed (e.g. the Japanese kids putting their pursuer back to spiritual sleep) One of those in question can be the God/Satan of Christian theology. That hand that emerges at the end of the movie? That's Satan's or a being like it. And then he made his way to LA for This is the End.       Rarity does the same thing when Sweetie Belle tries to touch her sewing machine.   She's generous like that.    FRIENDSHIP IS MMAAAAAAAAAAGGGICCCCCCCC!!   Have any companies done field tests with them? Is it anywhere near economically viable? If not automobiles where there's the risk of crashing, how long range have, say, automated drones been able to go?   It's also a secret sequel to This is The End.    That movie was such Razzie bait.    I read in some book that they don't like the word OK being said in their headquarters cause it's one of the most commonly used words in the English language and they want Coke to overtake it. Is that based on a true thing or an urban legend?    I like this Sons of Anarchy reboot.    Does the lack of an L have some meaning?   The Fantrapulous Inventions of Horatio Huffnagel    No you don't.    Basically in The Running Man the novel he's constantly on the run in the regular world. He's hiding out in a ghetto, jacking cars and planes, etc. Basically a fugitive. In the movie he's put in a gladiatorial ring. It's a weird change that they probably made for budgetary reasons.    Is this that Vice video?    You're the grandmother.    You mean she was stealing glances Craig's shoulder while writing her FiM?   Notice me, Sentwi!    You know, I thought that throwback face was really cute. But it probably would get a bit tiresome after awhile.    I trust there will be a wet hair, short hair Rarity soon.    Can't remember any that have happened to me recently except I was going to a temp job at four in the morning, couldn't see a thing, got completely lost so I just pulled into a random building to ask for directions, and it turned out that was where I was supposed to go.    It's your body's way of making your death feel like more of a relief.       Grimdark      With no skin, muscles, or anything, it gets really cold out of the water.    I sometimes feel kinda bad eating cows, deer, and pigs. Chicken I can eat all day guilt free. If for some reason I could only eat the animals I killed myself, I'd have to go exclusively with chickens at least for awhile.    In very large part it's because Larry the Cable Guy was in it, and many of the leftist critics hate him and his fanbase.       This explains all the anti-vax horseshit.    Wasn't there some big deal made about how it takes forever for anyone to strip in this movie?    I need to give that movie another try. I've heard it was beautiful but I just wasn't in the mood last time.    Well, I think Thor is explicitly said to be magical, so I think that makes it kind of not sci-fi. I have the same issue with Star Wars.    Probably because stormfront or some group like that vote brigaded this.    I assume the squirrel's estate will be contact about this.    Sheriff Lobo movie now inevitable.    I believe I've heard that China only sends about 25% of the grosses from overseas movies screened in their country. If that's true. is that exceptionally low? Normal?    Oh, I hope they give Nina Paley a gig eventually based on this.       Pretty much all three commentary tracks for Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas are good. Gilliam has all the good anecdotes, the actors are pretty funny too, and Thompson goes bugshit on his.    Inglourious Basterds's trailer highlighting all the moments of violence, not really featuring the subplot about Dominique, etc.    "Nah, I used a tear."    It's the ghost of this cat: http://imgur.com/gallery/vdLE8dJ   "Hey, dude, your wife's a horse."  "... What?"  "I'm a *what*?"   "How much for the second one?"   "Oh, it's free too!"    Ah, six whole years ago.    Plus she did that butt bounce during the pig song anyway, so she barely even needs magic.    Please oh please don't make it like Roberto Benigni's.    Ran's. Blind guy standing in front of a cliff. It's a great metaphor, but it doesn't beat you over the head with it.    Where are the unicorns? Where's the character Darkness?    Who needs more Union monuments? The intact USA is way the hell better than a thousand monuments would be.    Jurassic World. Your argument is invalid.    The ending of Plague Dogs.    Large parts of it are just boring. I'd rather watch something intentionally funny than have to wait dozens of minutes at a stretch for something campy to happen.

Imagine doing that to one of those giant ant colonies that carver ants and the like make.    Lately I've been walking to and from work while wearing a sleeveless shirt. As a result, my arms have tanned while my torso stayed pasty white. This morning I did some work digging up a shrub in an undershirt and missed putting sunscreen on both my upper shoulders. So when I took my shirt off, I had chocolate arms, strawberry lower shoulders, and vanilla upper shoulders and clavicles.  Tried to take a picture but my camera's a potato so it didn't really photograph very well.     It's such a tiny thing and I don't know if it was meant to be a joke, but I love that Hitler keeps calling his soldiers "guys." I love how even though he's fine with gunning them down to hit an enemy and clearly doesn't really care about them, on some level, he considers all those guys his bros.       You know, in non-Twilight stuff, Stewart and Pattinson have given some pretty good performances, so I think they actually could have pulled this off.    *Transformer noise*      But he was fine with Batman Forever?      Probably Pretty Woman, but it doesn't really get recommended to me much.    Uh, whose neck did Fluttershy accidentally break?   The bear's. It was the bear's, wasn't it?    This feels like one of those hiatus posts but either way behind or way ahead of schedule.    Warning: Zalgo   Yesterday there was this guy who looked in pretty decent shape. He was there for awhile with someone and as far as I saw he was just doing a typical workout. But seemingly with every rep, he would make a "HHHRRRUUKK!" noise like he was about to vomit. It didn't sound like physical exertion. And he did this for half an hour, really loudly every time. I wasn't the only one that noticed him either, I heard other people commenting on it. So weird.    Hey, you know the old saying: No place is a good place.    I wonder what scene or draft they were at where that happened.    I've read a couple Olivia Goldsmith, Sandra Brown, and Jennifer Crusie books.   So far it hasn't worked out particularly well for me.       I assumed if you knew what was being commented on, then it would be way easier to track them down and harass them.    Adjusted for creative accounting: $8.25.       You're doing the law of historical inevitability's work.    Please tell me Vasquez and company are killing some Na'vi.    Is the American Dream really to make a lot of money through mysterious means and then blow a big chunk on a vanity project people only enjoy most of a decade later ironically?  Cause if it is, looks like I'm on track.    Aww, and it got all dressed up to meet them and everything!   I really don't fantasize about being in a relationship anymore. Don't know why.    The gif cuts off before it zooms all the way out of the universe and then God rolls up the map.    That's called a moondog, right?    In short: MEDIOCRE!   Oh my lord are you correct.    I don't get then how the fault was supposed to lay with going from books to television. There were surely books as vacuous as television was at the time and TV broadcasts as thought-provoking.    70's folk singer-looking guy optional.    You'll need to cut it down to 25.

So, choose-your-own-adventure books where you have to flip through the pages one at a time will become a new fad?    Designed by Guillermo del Toro, I see.

It started back with The Matrix, it's just happening at an appropriately relaxed pace.    I heard awhile ago that the place isn't cleaned very well. Has anyone heard anything more recent about that?   But it was hardly a blockbuster.    I guess because otherwise the guy seems too dumb to be believable.    I worked for a summer at a restaurant a few years ago where any time a spatula fell on the floor, what we did was dunk the metal in the fryer for a few seconds. If your average fryer is indeed heated enough to kill whatever bacteria would have gotten on our spatulas from dropping them, how long would we have needed to dunk them?       Fucking sold.    "Did anyone bring an extra bag?" "No, nobody brought an extra bag!"  "I'm just askin'!"       "Wanna know how I got these scars? This douchebag sculpted them onto me!"

In hindsight, it was unlikely that the deer would kill the bear in this video.   He was hanging out with Dali because he had a picture he needed made.    I'd be pretty mad if that ate my pussy.    A comic book movie sucking is hardly going to keep comic fans from talking about it. I hear people going on about that shitty old Captain America movie from the 90s.    There are Monsters is really, really cheesy.    Found out my parents were into bondage when I was nine because a pair of handcuffs fell out of their suitcase in front of me. At least, I HOPE that's what that was about.       I'm not disputing that humans evolved from the same thing primates did, but what animals preceded primates?

 That's what I was thinking, but they never really acknowledge it beyond the phone call conversation.   True, but I wonder if he just says that to Marty and it's not actually true.  Otherwise, why would Doc be so confident standing in front of the Delorean while Einstein is being sent ahead 1 minute?  Doc and Marty easily could have been ran over if the experiment with Einstein failed.   So at the beginning of the first movie, Marty shows up at Doc's place and all of the clocks are being shown.  While Marty is talking to Doc on the phone the clocks all ring 8:00 am and Doc says "That means my experiment worked".  Referring to the clocks all being 25 minutes slow.  What experiment is Doc referring to in regards to the clocks?  Did he possibly time travel already himself?  If he already time traveled, then that would make sense that he knows Marty will be at his place at that time.  Otherwise, why would Doc call his own home if there shouldn't be anyone there to answer?   He only has 1 win. That's why he isn't locked in yet.   Yeah, it would have to be for wide release.  I know Grand Budapest Hotel was over $200,000 for its opening weekend.  I'm thinking that's the highest ever, bud something may have beaten it since it came out.   My cats breath smells like cat food.   Old North posted a picture the other day on facebook with their craft beers.  It had all of them for $5 a pint.  It didn't list the domestic beers, so not sure what those will be aside from cheaper than the craft beers.   [Timmy?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeOeIwKJ67g)   Harvick is apparently getting enough top 10's between this year and last year that Outback put a stipulation on it.  When hearing the advertisement on the radio for one race they mentioned a limit of 1 per table.  I don't think they had that in the past.   Burninator!   And of course they left the entire category for the end of the round. My brother and I thought for sure that Richard Petty would be one of the answers before they even started.   Lucas knows you made a typo in the title.   I was down there in 2012 and stopped by Hnedrick the Friday before the 600 and they had a bunch of stuff going on.  Inflatable things and I think a few small rides for kids.  Concession stands and small games to play.  Drivers talking and some autographs.  They didn't have anything extra opened up for the garage area or shop/museum though.  We actually had to park in one of the lots for the track and they bussed people in and out of the place since there wouldn't have been room for parking there.   Has anyone thought that maybe John not being human isn't actually a spoiler?  It could be something that's made known at the beginning of the movie and everything goes from there.  Maybe there's a human John in the future that the machines have captive and they send the cyborg back in his place?  Just a thought.   Wait, so Boris is 52 years old?  Or is that date wrong too?   Help us Obi Wan Nintendo.  You're our only hope.   Marvel did make the movie because they had the rights for using Hulk.  But the 2003 movie doesn't intertwine with the story of any of the current ones.  The 2008 Hulk includes Nick Fury at the end to connect it with all the other current Avenger characters.   And then they give the call to start the engines for an Xfinity race and no one hears a sound.  That'd be weird.   Nope.  It doesn't have any tie ins with the current movies.  The Hulk starts with the 2008 movie with Edward Norton.   Actually less than a decade.  These Marvel movies began in 2008, and we're getting the 11th and 12th ones both in 2015.   Yup, that's exactly what it is.   I wouldn't say the Wii was the least popular version of the game.  RB 1 and 3 sold more on the Wii than the PS3 and weren't much behind the 360 either.   For the first round of the Chase each driver gets 3 bonus points awarded to them per win of the regular season.  So in the example, Harvick would start the Chase with 6 more points than Johnson.   Go is definitely a good one here.   The other 2 for Jimmie are Chicagoland and Kentucky.  Last year he finally crossed Michigan off his winless list.   They are already planning on releasing 4 in 2017 though.  I believe with the same main toys.   The whole lineup of Cinnamon, Frosted, etc. are definitely the best EVER!   Not possible.  I don't have one.   Yup.  Jayski only has those 2 listed for penalties from last weekend.   Would that rule be changed since the post Bowyer spin debacle though?  After that NASCAR said drivers have to give 100% or risk being penalized.   **Jimmie Johnson**  After you were eliminated from the Chase last year, how much were you guys using the remaining races to prepare for the 2015 season?   I don't believe you.  I'm 35 and drink/get drunk regularly and I never get hangovers.  They went away during my college years.   Thanks.  This is just what I was looking for!   If not an app, then is there possibly another way aside from me manually putting them all in my phone?   They are each at the end of the months you listed.   Don't listen to the others. I'm 34 and basically since college I almost never get hangovers. And I drink every weekend. So there is hope that they get better instead of worse for you over time.   It's probably the Biff borrowing the firesuit.  He just wants some attention.   Last year I just wore my coat the entire time.  It didn't seem to get too warm with it on in there.   As lawnmower_of_destiny said, compared to other generations, the gap isn't that large.  PS2 was at 150M+, compared to GC and Xbox both in the lower 20M range.  PS1 was just over 100M compared to N64 with just 33M.  SNES compared to Genesis is a bit closer at 49M to 29M.  But regardless if you look at the percentages of sales, the Wii over PS3 and X360 is considerably smaller than any of the previous 3 generations.   I wouldn't call it a large margin.  Wii has sold about 101 million compared to about 85 million each for PS3 and Xbox 360.  The Wii jumped out to a huge lead initially, but then slowed a bunch after a few years while the other 2 were still selling really well.   Lesbian seagull?   I see a new super hero movie coming out....The Human Calculator vs. Numero Uno!   He looks so content with his beverage now.  Like a little kid just wanting their blanket.   Where are you buying enough oil for a vehicle for under $10?  Quarts of oil are over $3 a piece.  And pretty much any vehicle requires 4-5 quarts.  Even if you buy the larger 5 quart container it isn't much savings.  Either way, I'm agreeing with you that it isn't worth doing it yourself for the price it can be done at a store.  Maybe a $5 savings by doing it yourself for most vehicles with standard oil.   Tyler Perry's Madea goes to Space!   I personally would go with the shirt.  As ForwardBound mentioned, your legs don't really get too cold.  Especially after you start the run.   Since when are people allowed to bring their phone/camera into the emergency room before a surgery?   Believing advice found on Reddit.   I got a lot of problems with you people!   I definitely understand where you're coming from.  It would make more sense to call his titles Winston Cup titles.  Or at the very least maybe leave the sponsorship out of it altogether.  Just say he won 7 Cup titles and leave it be.   It makes it sound like he just keeps on winning more titles!   True, they can see if the 5 lugs are glued to the rim before being carried over the wall.  But it's still possible for one to fall off in the process of putting the tire on.  Maybe the tire changer would just skip the one that fell off and only use 4.  And you're right that the RR tire can be over the line and still be a legal pit stop.  The RF would not be allowed over the line.   The change didn't say anything in regards to being able to have less than 5 lug nuts on each wheel.  They still need all 5 on the car, they just don't have to be tight.  So there will still be 43 officials out on pit road to see if all 5 get put on each wheel.  Plus they have to check to see if the car is fully in the pit box. Edit: Typed Loose instead of tight initially   I never really understood how an offical is able to tell if a lug nut is fully tight or not from their view.  What specifically did they look for to be able to see this?  Because if it's screwed on 80% of the way, but just not tight, wouldn't it be pretty tough to tell that it's loose?   NASCAR would still need an official at each pit stall.  They'd still be checking to make sure 5 lug nuts were put on each tire (this article says they just don't have to be tight, doesn't say they can be missing), the car is within the pit box, tires aren't just freely rolled back to the wall, etc.   DENTAL PLAN   You'll be fine.  I went from 20 years old to 30 between visits.  They didn't jusge me and I had no cavities!  So I'm good for another 10!   I agree with you that it needs to help Nintendo sell systems.  But for the current install base it's a good start over just 3 days.   Considering there are only 3 million Wii u's in the U.S., that's 1 out of 6 people who bought the game in the first 3 days.  Doesn't seem so bad in that regards.   And it put them on the map!   So it'll definitely be lower than the previous two for the whole weekend then.   First see if 4K home technology catches on before worrying about something like this.   Yeah, the robots fighting is definitely the main attraction for the movies.  Acting, not so much.   The company wasn't trying to make an evil transformer to accomodate the bounty transformer.  They were making transformers to assist with stuff along the lines of military use.  The problem was that they linked it to Megatron's memory and that is what made it evil.  From there Megatron/Galvatron was able to control the other transformers created by the company.  In regards to the bounty transformer, he was working in secret with whatever the government agency Kelsey Grammar worked for.  Their job was hunting down any hiding transformers.  The bounty hunter was working with them in order to capture Optimus for himself.   I don't recall reading anything specifically saying it only applies to the final 4. But I assumed it will be that way and other drivers still get bonus points for their finishing positions.   Bought Korn's re-issued latest album in August at Best Buy.  It was an exclusive release through them.   That makes sense.  Thanks!   During Gordon's interview he called Brad a dipshit and it was aired on tv.  I know it's been a while, but back in 2004 when Dale Jr won at Talladega (I believe his 5th time) he said "shit" during an interview and was fined and docked points for saying that during a live interview.  Jr was fined 25 points, which would be about equivalent to 6 points today.  Why wouldn't Gordon get penalized for the same thing?   Drivers licenses do expire, at least in Ohio.  It says right on it "Expires on" and then has the date.  They expire when you turn 21, and then every 4 years afterwards.  And a bar can legally turn someone down if they are trying to use an expired ID even if it says they are clearly over 21.   Doubtful that NASCAR was popular since the 1930's, considering it didn't exist until 1948.  However, racing in general was popular since the 1930's in the southeast.   The odds of that are approximately 3,720 to 1.   Correct!   Here's an easy one.  What's the only track that Jeff Gordon has finished 43rd at?  And he's actually done it twice and this track.  	73
 I don't know how to begin processing that.   I had a reoccurring nightmare as a kid. It wasn't as classically horrible as a demon face or being chased or anything like that. In my dream I had a bird's-eye view of my bedroom, except that there was nothing in it at all (no furniture, no toys, not even carpeting) and the walls and floor were painted a perfect, seamless, unblemished white. I would look down from the ceiling of my room and directly below me was a brown circle that over the months I came to realize was the top of someone's head, but that was all I could see of them, the top of their head. I have no idea to this day who that person was. I would stare down at this unmoving person for a time, unable to move or say anything, then slowly the ceiling would recede straight up, taking me with it. But the strangest thing was that in my peripheral  could tell that the walls were still attached, but that they weren't stretching up with me. It's really hard to explain that in my unavoidable concentration on this person's head as it receded dozens of feet below me slowly but surely that I could tell that on the sides I was only five or so feet above them still. I felt like I was drifting in a way, and my stomach felt strangely sunken, as if it were collapsing in on itself. To make matters worse for the entirety of this nightmare Mary Had A Little Lamb would play voicelessly on repeat in the background. This nightmare scared me in a way that I couldn't articulate at such a young age and still have trouble with today. It's really difficult to get across accurately just how empty, alone, small, and terrified I felt drifting up on that ceiling away from the only other sign of life.   That is the only story from those books that actually scared/disturbed me. I still can't think about it and it's been 8+ years.   Well, it would be interesting to know what is was, but I can only feel that you dodged a bullet not getting first hand experience. Thanks for sharing and I hope you find out some day, or at least find someone with a similar experience to talk to.    that's super creepy. or maybe they knew better than to admit they had seen it. did you ever hear of any missing children while you lived there?   did you ever ask any of the other kids in your apt. if they had ever seen it?   I did some more research and you are right. It definitely was real, although it was hard to find anything concrete about the show at first. The actress was a bust for anything concrete, the publisher I found for it was a bust, and imdb, Rotten Tomatoes, and Wikipedia were no help. However, I did find a thread by someone that was able to answer pretty much all questions, or at least hypothesize sufficiently. Here is the link http://forums.henshinjustice.com/showthread.php?95276-Vitsie-the-Videositter   Just wanna say thanks for the post!  	7
    Triglycerides fluctuate even during a single day -  lowest at 3 a.m., rising until mid-afternoon and decreasing thereafter.Unhealthy weekend behavior  [affects weight](http://www.karger.com/Article/FullText/356147) too, but for many people is OK, as they compensate for weekend splurges on weekdays. Long-term habits make more of a difference.        Similar to supertasters: it is a superpower (they make great sommeliers   food tasters) and a burden (as sensory extremes will hurt)      Myxobacteria is the most fascinating social bacteria. It [was known] (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22511878) they exchange outer membrane lipoproteins to coordinate behaviors, but exchange of lipopolysaccharides to repair each other is even more striking. Myxobacteria produces many useful chemicals including antibiotics. Another proof that getting your hands in the dirt has health benefits.            	8
 We had an Android Wear watchface for few months, but it was using old (now deprecated) API and we took it off store. Currently we are working on: Hardware clock, updated Android app with many neat (I hope so) features, and then Wear watchface.  Sorry to put this on the end but we are rewriting whole app to make rending clock faster and more flexible to many situations, and then we can work on watchface with awesome performance.   Thanks, I just fixed those mentioned and ask native friend to make a full proofread with some fixing style.   Sorry if it sounded off putting. My previous posts was mostly - tinkering is awesome and I really recommend it (even if you "end up buying mine") as you will have tons of fun, and maybe we have missed some important thing. Also I already developed (for now a beta part) an API for 12hours to allow 3rd party devs to play with this, as I can find one, two... uses for this but I'm sure there are tons more.      Once I find a bit of free time I will make a (probably) medium short story how it went from idea (3 years ago) to current state (and hopefully to product on the market).  Let's just say it was a lot of tinkering, seeing what works, what doesn't, what we should improve, what are key aspects, polishing design, polishing design etc.  And don't get me wrong, attaching LEDs to a clock was easy but for example figuring out that it is good to move from wall clock to desk one is a better idea was tricky part.   Thanks, I have added paragraph "what?" near top to make it more clear. Hope it is fine now.         Sorry didn't tested it via VPN, maybe some server lag. I changed an hour ago setting where it is available  and description - description was refreshed thus I though it is also available worldwide.   I tried similar thing at my old Asus UX32VD - swapping screens between 2014 and 2012 edition. With no luck. Screen was fine but they used cable with different length that had weird angle at one place... I wasn't able to bought it - so I gave up.  So be prepared for that kind of stuff.   How about existing quadrocopter with assault rifle on a gimbal  - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SNPJMk2fgJU      I don't know what kind of app are you making, but I would recommend going through Google flags apps like Gmail, Newsstand, Play Store itself and check things like button presses. They do not have touch. Even Google Maps sound is limited to voice commends which is key-feature.  One app that I'm aware that stands out is Facebook - sound on refresh, but they are big enough to push their own ideas across platforms.  I'm not sure how it looks currently but at some point also Twitter from what I recall had some sounds on refresh list.   Not a source but considering your example (button clicks) -  don't do this. For one simple reason - many users have build in system sound for click on touch screen (ex. LG by default), which will be supper annoying.  Or just offer simple way to turn it off.  Also it is not common to implement sounds in apps (if we consider UI - as refreshes, buttons etc.) probably in most cases only notifications are "loud". Of course this doesn't apply to for example music apps for obvious reasons.      Great sample project for this: https://github.com/eskimoapps/ResourceNestingExample      That would be nice, any suggestions with "easy-to-understand" English and/or subtitled shows?   Good one, need to ask my SO as she watches as well tons of it on Youtube so maybe solution is that easy.   Cooking and tennis (both playing and watching). Probably recipe book in English is a bit boring and will be off putting.   Hi, I installed Duolingo on my grandma tablet and she started learning at amazing peace and eager. Started with 0 language knowledge around a month ago. Her native language is Polish and Duolingo offering Polish-English course was a big plus. My guess was to start with movies in English with Polish subtitles as probably her reading skills are better than listening. Other idea is to convince her to go for special course. What are your recommendations for older people?   Chet Haase - Patterns, Shmatterns  https://www.parleys.com/tutorial/quickie-patterns-shmatterns   https://www.mashape.com/      I don't know where you live but in my area apart from Hackathons (which probably aren't best fit for you as you are looking for a not that rapid developing) there are dozens of meeting to solve some problems in society - for example http://kodujdlapolski.pl/ which means "code for Poland" and in most of their meetings there are at least few ideas and always too little dev people.  Another idea is to take some popular Android app that is abandoned for a while (bad UI, slow etc.) and make it much better - just be aware of trade marks etc.  Also probably /r/Android or /r/enterpreneur is better to give you just an idea for an app.   Mine does (X1 2015) when CPU is used and I scroll too fast, is there way to turn this off?   If you think about mobile startup - nice and short reading.  Also as a mobile dev - I can highly agree with author. https://medium.com/@pents90/the-story-of-appchat-and-why-android-is-a-better-platform-for-startups-than-ios-6d0847427fb1   Take into account Lenovo flex 2 14 or X1 as wel fit your size needs.  Basically all Lenovo have not most bright screen - so if you would like to work on sunny beach, you might consider other laptop (Dell for example).  Source: owner of X1 na SO has a Flex 2.  EDIT: You are asking at /r/thinkpad for dell noise issues? sry?   Went from 10 to 300, not going back.   Go for some used Samsung old flagship - as S2 or S3. They are still popular, and some errors as Samsung-specific from what I saw.  Moto E is nice but, hey it is almost vanilla Android so there is almost no chance of getting an error.   https://vimeo.com/18293265   Skip to 0:45, and 2:27 is probably one of most beautiful shots I have ever seen.   I use Win 8.1 (came with win 7 - uh).  HDPI is fine, now using FullHD on 24" is a pain ( a bit joking but hell, you get addicted to hdpi). There is no many issues with hdpi - mainly scaling in not round way ( 100% is supper small, 150% is fine, but 123% for example is blurry in many place), some installers are a bit blurry but I hope with Win 10 it will be a bit better (also steam application is not hdpi-friendly). Probably HD on 14" is just enough but QHD is only version that was available here in Poland with i7.   Polish "PLAY".   X1 3rd gen i7, non-touch QHD maks brightness with developing in Android Studio + chrome + emulator = around 5,5-6h Screen could be more bright, touchpad one or two times (since 2 months) had some problems - trackpoint not, restart helped. Overally happy but 8GB is a bit of pain, 12GB would be perfect. Would buy it second time - also LTE is super nice (even if before buying it wasn't key feature) having 1GB per month for 15$ a year is super nice fallback.  	34
 Im 17 years old going into my senior year in high school.  The past years of high school have been rough.  Freshman year most of my friends went off to hang out with other cliques and shit and started acting like dicks (HIGHSCHOOL WOW).  In the winter of my sophomore year I got diagnosed with fucking type 1 diabetes. I'm to embarrassed to tell anyone I'm diabetic which leads to me not taking insulin for days on end.  After I got hit with diabetes about two years ago I really stopped giving a fuck.  I started smoking weed and drinking shortly after getting it, my grades went to shit too.  As soon as I discovered weed I knew I was gonna be hooked.  It was the easiest way to get rid of all of my problems temporarily and I loved it, I was smoking 4 times a day by that summer.  In my head I knew getting diabetes triggered all this drug use and shit but I really didn't care, I never really valued myself before I got diagnosed but the way I saw it getting diabetes was my excuse to get away with a ton of shit.    My parents first caught me with weed a week after I smoked for the first time.  They drug tested me and then took my shit, my Dad whooped my ass and then screamed at me to never do it again.  I promised him I wouldn't but I was fucking lying right through my teeth.  I was so fucking mad the first time I got caught, I felt like I never got my turn to actually experiment with weed before I got caught.    Getting caught by my parents triggered a whole downward cycle.  They would catch me like once every two weeks after that and I was grounded 24/7.  Obviously I wasn't going to stop smoking weed so I could be ungrounded so, I constantly snuck out and ran away to go get drunk or high with my friends. This went on for about 6 months and as time went on my relationship with my parents got worse.  To the point where my mom refused to speak to me for a week after I didn't confess to stealing $500 from her wallet (money that was supposed to be spent on my Dad for his birthday.  I'm such a piece of shit I know).    Last January I ran away one evening and took 25i NBOME (pretty much fake lsd- I thought It was real at the time) and had a horrible trip.  During the trip I felt like my life was stuck in the same 1 hour loop for eternity along with some other scary shit.  Afterwards though I was fucking losing my mind.  My ego was completely shattered and all I wanted to do when I got home was apologies to my parents and cry with my Mom.  I though I had given myself brain damage so after coming clean to my parents I vowed to stay sober and rebuild my relationship with my parents (no brain damage though).  My Mom put me in therapy that February and I started taking anti anxiety meds soon after.  I thought that if I cleaned up my act it would help me understand more about who I am but that didn't work at all and after suffering for two months sober I started doing drugs again last April.  It's July now.  Im still stealing from my parents to buy weed.  I hate myself completely but I don't care about myself enough to fix anything.  My parents are really pushing my to go to collage but I'm really not interested at all.  I feel as if this is all being forced upon me and I don't get a say.  All my parents seem to care about is getting me into a collage so they can go brag to their fucking friends about me.  They make me so fucking mad.  I'm still in therapy but it really isn't helping.  My parents caught me again and I got into a huge fight with my Dad where I ended up running away, stealing a 40 oz from 711 and sleeping on a park bench.  My parents  I just don't care about anything in anymore.  My life is meaningless, all life is in general.  It's impossible for anyone to be content ever.  I feel that because I'm aware of the sad reality of this world i'll never be able to be happy.  I don't want to pick a career, I don't want to go to collage and I really don't want to live anymore.   The only thing stopping me from jumping off a bridge one night is my irrational fear that when we die we stay in our bodies unable to move or communicate.  Thus leaving me stuck inside a box for all of eternity.  That wouldn't explain what would happen to people who are cremated though.  I digress  This may sorta come out funny cuz I just wrote this while alone and drunk in my basement.  I am a complete nobody with no interests no skills and no motivation to do anything about it.   normally reread my reddit posts but im too drunk for that shit sorry for spelling  TL;DR: I'm a self destructive idiot who feels sorry for himself.   I feel you man.  I'm 16 and I pretty much know i'm going to be in the same boat when I'm 19.  I've been dreading my birthdays for the past year.   fuck yeah im blazin in dc rn   Yo I just saw FIDLAR and METZ in Dc a few days ago   Use a ratchet and a bottle cap dude   I'd recommend saving Europe for last    Hello I am building my pc based of the great build at http://www.logicalincrements.com.

Na random diskusiji  Edit: podstavio sam. Da li se pise poDstavio ili postavio?    Ovi iz drezdena su seljaci...    Ne diraj moj narod   Slazem se... Secam se da mi drustvo reklo kad sam trazio kantu za smece, da bacim papir na ulicu "jer smo u Srbiji"... Budale. Ali sada je bolje. I kad vidim da neko baca nesto na ulicu onda i pridjem i kazem da to digne.   Edit: ali samo ako je manji od mene   Cekam njegov snimak. POV   I jos su vikali "alah akbar"... To je najbolje sto se nama moglo desiti jer medije pisu o tome i sada vide ljudi (ovi sa zapada) s kojim budalama Srbi moraju da dele njihovu zemlju. Iako ga ne volim. Hvala Vucicu sto si zrtvovao tvoju facu za srpski narod   Citajte klix i sve vam je jasno. Muslimani su osudjeni da mrze.    Nadam se da ce se izviniti kamenu jos sutra...

To je samo Kandic, ona je placena za to.   You have also nice apartments in centre of Belgrade for 25 a night (for two persons). For a month rent I think there you will get something for 250$.   If you dont go out that much (Party, eating in restaurants) then 400-500$ will be fine (better 600$-700$).   Welcome to Serbia. You will like it.    Taj vise lici na Vucica   Najjace mi je da klix ovu vest ne sme da objavi jer nije pravoslavac... Tako ne mogu da sire mrznju :)   Kako me nervira ova Kandic. Ne mogu nju ni smisliti. Ko nju finansira? Ipak je lepo videti da Srbi ne padaju na Muslimansku propagandu.    Najgore mi je da prepisu vesti za klixa i indexa i verovatno i drugih novina iz regiona. Cenzurisu komentare na maksimun. Plus nisu objektivni   I tako je nas vodio u propast   Mislim da je Vojvodina idealno mesto za to.    Svaka cast tom coveku.

 put grape on poison and poison grape on mouth   I would like to purchase some history, math, and language text books like the ones you get in school.    Do you think Trump should have been more careful and said more specifically who he was against and what worries him. He knows Mexicans are hard workers. So if he generalized all of them on accident then that is the issue.    lol   I don't see enough discussion going on, just accusations. I understand peoples worries about issues even if I disagree with them.   The only people giving republicans bad names are themselves if they don't challenge Trump on what he is saying. I meant stereotyped, narrow-minded republican maybe.     They don't even ask good questions. You have to specifically ask him if it is true that most immigrants from Mexico are criminals. Don't just say, would you take back anything you said? That's a cop out. They don't want to get involved with the mess.    Saying all people from anywhere are rapists is factually wrong and ridiculous.    Good information. Thanks.  	9
       I'm fascinated by the fact that is has an elevator in one of its legs down to the sea floor, how is this possible? And what purpose does it serve?       Also, what was the purpose of the friggin minigun they had with them in space?   That was a lot more interesting than I expected! Thank you    I guess it was when I was 19, I dropped out of school and decided the thing for me to do was to move, far away, Australia. I was going through a lot of emotional issues at the time and I hoped that moving to another place would help me 'discover' myself in some way. I flew out there on a shoestring budget so I had loads of connections, it was a long trip! I eventually made it to my hostel in Sydney, I remember being completely shellshocked as I lay on my bed, I wasn't the best at speaking to people back then so it took me days before I met anyone, that's the loneliest moment if my life so far.   I went to college with this guy who was really into ghost hunting, like it was all he would talk about. Anyway one day after class he invites myself and another classmate to a ghost exploration, thing. So we figured why not might be a laugh. We met up outside this old building in the middle of town, there were a few others there also. The building was the oldest prison in the city, where they used to keep murders ect.   When we went in, the first thing that happened was the lights were turned off so it was pitch black in there. We then stood in a circle and held hands as he started calling out to the spirits, I'm not sure what was supposed to happen but I found it hilarious how you could still hear the cars ect on the street. Anyway after a bit of that he started throwing marbles into rooms, the idea was that when a marble came back that was it being 'interfered' with in some way - I seen right through this as he was basically chucking them and they would hit the wall at the other side and come back.   I ended up volunteering to sit in a prison cell on my own upstairs while the others continued to do more hand-circle callouts. Every time someone would ask the spirit to "make itself known" I would make a little noise like "crawww" and they would all shit themselves. Anyway, that was an odd experience but interesting.   Cocoa Butter   FYI anyone thats thinking about it, DO NOT try shooms in Amsterdam, 0/10 worst trip ever.   [Bonsai Kitten?](http://bonsaikitten.com)   Christ...

 My mom is just getting more and more mad at me as she figures out how messed up I am.  A girl I look up who I thought was 'recovered' and has helped me through certain things is suddenly binge eating (like two whole jars of nut butter in one day, pints of ice cream even though she's weight-restored) and that scares me.  Is giving up an option? I know it's not, I just wish someone would tell me it is. I find it really hard to think people can get truly 'better'.   It really is a bad day. Yours truly can't get away with nothin' and is missing out on hibachi :(  Maybe try to scare yourself with how bad IP is? Being monitored on the clock drives me insane.  	2
             And never will...   The non-dischargeability transfers.  Sorry for the boring answer.   High end: Frog Hollow   No idiot would believe what Gawker says?  You did.   Excellent news but statutory protections are ultimately still needed. The EEOC can later change its mind and - *poof* - there go these protections.   Man being publicly outed was my absolute worst nightmare scenario when I was closeted. What an awful thing for Gawker to do.   If this shuts down RFRA, I'm all for it.   Blue Ridge has a surprisingly large gay population.   The power of the Supreme Court rests almost exclusively on its perceived authority. If that credibility is lost, so is its power. Also, the Supreme Court has very little control over what subject matter it adjudicates - cases are brought to it, not the other way around.  The other two branches have military power (the President) and the power to tax and spend (Congress).   Individuals generally only file Chapter 11 if they have a lot of debt (specific numbers set by Congress).  The more common restructuring for individuals is Chapter 13. In a Chapter 13, the court essentially takes what you *have* to pay and spreads it out over a 3 to 5 year period and you pay monthly.    Scalia should serve as an example of what not to do.  I wonder how he will react if it ever dawns on him that he is tarnishing his legacy.   The non-dischargeability passes to the new loan.   Anyone know what cross street this is?   I tend to think you're being disingenuous at this point. Do you not recall the homosexuality/Chick-fil-A dustup?  If not, [here's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chick-fil-A_same-sex_marriage_controversy) the Wikipedia entry.  Clearly the public will not "punish" all businesses for being anti-homosexuality. We have a modern example where the business actually benefited from it.   So you don't think the government should be able to prevent a "Murder for Hire" business?   I am referring to "paying dearly" at the hands of society. Did Chick-fil-A benefit or lose from its anti-homosexuality position?    But in 2015, I don't know of any business that would discriminate against black people. And if they did, I think society would make sure they paid dearly for it.  If you think this argument works in the homosexual context, how do you explain Chick-fil-A?    I want to enable people to live freely.  Surely you acknowledge there are limitations (e.g., freedom to kill other people).  Non-discrimination in public accommodations is simply another reasonable limitation. The government has said that as a condition of receiving the perks of being a corporation, that corporation must follow certain rules, including not refusing service based on race.  The freedom argument only makes sense if you think, say, your freedom is unjustly restricted because you can't kill anyone you want.   Maybe it's sped up?   Boat drinks. Waitress I need two more boat drinks!   A SC Republican state politician rightly said that the flag flying on the capitol grounds had more to do with what was happening in the 1960s than the 1860s.   Elected officials generally can't be fired.  But if the clerk has a "shall" duty to issue marriage licenses, an aggrieved party needs to sue him in federal court.  Summary judgment will be granted and the federal judge will give him three options: (1) issue marriage licenses, (2) resign, or (3) go to jail for civil contempt.   You could use LEDs to allow for customization.   I live on the border and my experience has been very positive. A lot of older folks have passed away since 2000 and have been replaced by people who were no older than 3 at that time.  Just about eveyone I talk to agrees it is time to move on.

A federal judge could give her three options: (1) comply, (2) resign, or (3) be held in contempt and go to jail.   The Moto 360 uses wifi so I'm sure the Apple Watch will have it fairly soon. Cuts the tether to a large degree (at work/around the house).   And deaf.   How'd you pull off the tear?  Edit: Apart from Snoo-rape, of course.   Explain? I'm genuinely curious and to make that statement, you need to be intimately familiar with both of their personal ideologies.   ... ok. I don't disagree. That really just proves me point.  If you repeatedly hold yourself out as more pious than others, it's more damning when you act otherwise.   Is he wearing a skirt?   Liberals don't wrap themselves in religion like conservatives do. That's the difference.   Yes.   Because it's all bullshit. It's never been about protecting marriage; it's always been about not liking the homos.      They don't realize that sane people use the comment section of any online news article to pinpoint the batshit viewpoint.  They're doing progressives a favor.   Yep - happening to me, too. Curiously, it's only happening on my desktop - works fine on my Chromebook.   This is like "Air America".  The left doesn't do talk radio well, and the right doesn't do this well.   Are you suggesting that governments _don't_ request bids from private companies?   The owners of this station don't want to show it. Are you suggesting we somehow force them to?   You have no right to decide what a private company broadcasts. If YOU don't like this decision, change the channel.   I don't think that's what is happening.  I was born and raised - and live - in the Deep South (white Millennial). If I owned TVLand, I'd probably not like having it in my line up.  Is that because I'm scared of not being PC? No. It's just distasteful to me and I want no part of it. And as the owner of TVLand, well, it's my choice (and it's your choice to watch something else).  Go buy it on Google Play.   "More votes than _EVER_!"      Congratulations! You two need to go on a double date with the first gay couple in Richmond County, haha.   Columbia County is for money. Richmond County is for wealth (and the poor).   Trump is proof that having a lot of money only means you have a lot of money.   ... All three.   Damn straight.   Another big argument is unfounded wars.  Can't tell if that's a typo because they both work.   June is a common time for SCOTUS opinions. It's not a coincidence but it's not why.   As a gay attorney, I need that T-shirt.  Gimme.   He sounds like a commentor on my local newspaper... it's embarrassing for him.   Richmond County Courthouse on Walton Way.  Holy shit, y'all. :)   But isn't Scalia the source of the "benign neglect" quote when it comes to statutory construction?  I don't recall the specifics but I'm fairly certain it was an Administrative Law ruling from before he was on the SCOTUS.   Tomorrow is also the start of Stonewall Weekend.      ^^^5   South Carolina...         Ask for the identity of the "trained member" who personally reviewed the complaint.  That should quickly resolve most bullshit.   I'm involved now, but can't say I would have been...   We are capable of addressing more than one issue at a time. One thing being extremely important doesn't make a very important thing unimportant.         "YOU tell _me_!"   Helluva time to find that out (for either person)...   Source unnecessary... that many abs don't get together all at once otherwise.   _Frodooooooo of the nine fingers...._   Loser pays is an awful system that benefits the wealthy. If a person is harmed by the negligent or intentional acts of someone, but knows that they will be responsible for fees if they lose, that person will be much less likely to file suit.   Then why are you flying a flag?  If you know you're a proud... whatever, why do you care if other people know it?   In my experience, it's part of an SEO package. When an SEO company is hired, every attorney using that company recommends you.   ... I'm referring to the employee being imprisoned for violating parole by a few hours.   And Indiana.   Yep. I was born and raised in the South.  It's a traitor's flag. Nothing more.   For fuck's sake I hate this "be 100% perfect" mentality. Give the guy a break.   Ehhh.... Avvo is crap. Good ratings are essentially bought.  Google/Facebook reviews or plain old word of mouth are the best source for reviews.  Edit: I didn't downvote you /u/TheTatCat213. But I did get you back up to zero!   My thought was that the flow would slowly run down due to friction or whatever, but it would take a while. Adding a turbine would cause it to run down _much_ quicker.  In other words, it might appear to be perpetual motion device but really just slowly stopped.  Of course, "fake" is a much cleaner answer.   I'd like to take a peek into this judge's closet. People that bellow that loudly about "moral decay" are more often than not doing something pretty morally decadent.  Edit: Not that it is important, but we should all give each other a bit of a break.   Taqueria El Patron?   Major sexual tension is probably why.   Unworkable because it results in a contradiction. To enforce such a concept, the actual "freedom of speech" would have to be violated.  I'm on mobile so can't really flesh it out, but the discussion interests me.   Excellent example.   I'm with ya. I've dug into this private free speech right thing before and it always leads to absurd results.  I'd love to see an analysis of it though.    Do you have any examples of non-government freedom of speech?   Can you find any analysis of this private free speech principle? I've looked and haven't ever really found anything.  Personally, I don't think it exists (because it is unworkable). The public just assumes it does because of how important the well-known public free speech principle is.  I do agree that anyone who promises no censorship but then censors is hypocritical. But they didn't violate my freedom of speech.  I'd also like to point out that we're really talking about degree here. This site is already moderated and censored (no child porn).  Edit: As for questioning a private company that doesn't allow "free for all" free speech, I strongly disagree. Businesses are not public discourse vehicles. If my employees tried to debate the merits of slavery with my customers, I would likely fire them (with good reason).   So it isn't about anyone's freedom of speech then, right?  It's simply about a private company changing its policy. Appealing to "freedom of speech" just strikes me as an emotional appeal.   I question that because the public is mistaken about "freedom of speech" that that changes anything.  I would love to see someone flesh it out, because every time I do, it seems clearly unworkable to me.   Why does Reddit owe you or anyone else "freedom of speech"? Where does it end?  Do I owe you freedom of speech? If I invite you over and you tell my child he shouldn't be able to get married because he's gay, am I wronging you in some way by asking you to leave?  I would really like to read an analysis of this concept, because every time it comes up, it doesn't seem to be a valid concept (when analyzed thoroughly).   That's my point.  I'm really not aware of a concept of "free speech" apart from the public right. The government is supposed to get out of the debate so it can be freely had. And the point of all this is not to debate _per se_, it's for ideas to compete, and win or lose based on their merits (e.g., feeding babies = good, child rape = bad).  But when a private individual says "_X_ is wrong", it's no one's place to then force that individual to say otherwise. I'm gay but don't think I can go into Mike Huckabee's house and force him to give me a platform to advocate gay marriage. However, if he has opened his house up to debate (better analogy to Reddit), and then decides to close it - well, all we can do is leave.  But in both examples, no one's free speech has been violated. It just doesn't seem to be a concept that withstands scrutiny when invoked as between two private individuals.  Do you have a link to a treatise on non-public freedom of speech? I'm genuinely curious because this comes up every time a corporation does something that someone disagrees with (e.g., Chick-fil-A).   I didn't say anything about a new law.  What do you think is the proper recourse if the owners of Reddit choose to violate your private right to freedom of speech?   I don't think a "private" right of free speech makes sense as a concept.  How would that work? Is Reddit supposed to be prevented from banning FPH (and by whom)?  The marketplace of ideas isn't desirable simply to have concepts lobbed back and forth, it's desirable to discuss those concepts _and judge them_.  Edit: Can anyone link to an analysis of the "philosophical ideal" of a private right to freedom of speech?    That place is going to get sued into oblivion.      That was an interesting "ah ha" moment when someone pointed it out on reddit.  Many people who think it is a choice might actually be bisexual, so to them which sex they mate with *is* a choice.   This could be /r/bestof material.   You can't catch it, if he knocks it down.   It is less than unusual.   Can Facebook events without a date be created?   Hey /r/Augusta!  On the day the decision is released, supporters of gay marriage will gather for a rally outside of the Richmond County courthouse (Walton Way) between 4:30 PM and 7:00 PM.  The date is unknown but the time and place are being [coordinated](http://georgiaequality.org/issues/marriage-relationships/day-of-decision/) by Augusta Pride and Georgia Equality.  Come join us!   Holy shit.   It's ego stroking.   Given that the victim is trans, it is reasonable to look into the possibility that that was the motivation.   I think it's relevant to point out here that homosexuality used to "be" a mental illness. Given that, I am very skeptical of any argument against the trans community that uses similar justifications.   I find this whole discussion fascinating. I'm gay and fairly well involved with the local LGBT community but I've never drilled down into the trans community and its concerns to this degree.  I'm glad to see it is being well received by the public and media (overall). A lot of us have a lot to learn and that's easier when you're receptive.   We don't know it's not relevant. The police are still investigating.   I don't think all straight people would stop having sex were the punishment the same.    I'm actually super awesome now.  "Everything is awesome!"   Can you list a few legitimate arguments that are not based on religion?      He said jiffs.   I love being self-employed.   Ah, yes. I misunderstood who was trying to dodge liability. I wonder why the company wasn't named by the U.S. though...   The comment he's referencing doesn't make sense though. Naming Nike wouldn't have subjected the U.S. government to lawsuits by Nike "until proven".   If I recall correctly, legal pleadings are generally exempt from libel/slander.   I've been there and got out. This is solid advice.  In 5 years, it will be the best decision you ever made.  Edit: "Been there" = unhappy, not specifically the same or a similar situation.   It doesn't have to be a manipulative relationship. The working spouse may be willing to support a talent they also see (or at least think should be explored).   Well, it is offensive. If not being offensive is something you value, now you know how to approach this issue so as not to be offensive.  Again, it's not a big deal to make the mistake. But knowingly misgendering someone is.   Oh I don't disagree that she is more than a member of the transgender community. But it's offensive to refer to her as a him.  It's similar to refusing to refer to a gay spouse as "husband" because a husband is married to a wife (woman).  It's an understandable mistake given the nascency of the transgender movement. But knowing that it is offensive and refusing to adjust is not.   That's it! Thanks. Definitely makes my eyes glaze over when I run across it in the wild.   So I guess I have a few weeks of "by the each" to look forward to.   It looks like you can even see where the old curb was.  	130
 Low hanging fruit man...low hanging fruit...   Sorry, you're right..should say "after Q3 earnings report" or something similar. My mistake :-/      Probably a floor saf...I mean, nothing. It's probably nothing.   Ahhh, video game justice.         Yeah, I was wondering that myself.    144 deaths, 1,391 injuries and 8,061 device malfunctions were recorded out of a total of more than 1.7 million robotic procedures carried out between January 2000 and December 2013.  That's less than a 0.1% failure rate on robotic surgeries (factoring in deaths and injuries, but not device malfunctions). I'd be curious to learn what the comparable rate is for human surgeons.      I can't tell if I'm reading this in Arnold's voice or Jorgen Von Strangle from Fairly Odd Parents.   This post is half-baked.  I'll show myself out.      Here we go again...   Sad that this had to escalate this far before they would even acknowledge this...   Is this irony? Or is this one of the times when I get lambasted for not knowing the difference between irony and coincidence?   Love that movie. Such a great picture of a loving, long-term relationship...   Totally agree. A checklist makes you look to put people into a box, and then disqualify them if they don't fit. It's a good way to miss out on truly unique and special people...   I saw this article and it made me smile: https://www.avelist.com/list/how-do-you-know-theyre-the-one-16137. How and when did you know that your fiance/husband/wife was "the one"? Would love to hear stories. Was it gradual? A specific moment? Did they fit a pre-determined checklist? Was it logical or a feeling?   Yeah, I was always impressed with the career fairs and the number of big players in the tech/engineering space that were present.         Yeah, those are great suggestions, thanks!   Please feel free to comment here with your own suggestions and recommendations !      Yeah, totally agree about the pillowcases. I've used the "sleeping on a hand towel" method with some success, but there's no substitute for clean, freshly washed pillowcase.   Recently came across this list (https://www.avelist.com/list/5-surprising-causes-of-adult-acne-and-inexpensive-solutions-18512), and while most of the items listed make sense to me, I was wondering if #1 was really an issue?  I talk on the phone for work a fair amount, and now I'm thinking that investing in a headset will not only help rest my arms/hands, but also help keep my face clear.  Curious to hear your thoughts/comments...   It's as if car alarms have taught us nothing about proper theft deterrent...   Careful, he might get clubbed on the head for comments like that.   That's super cute! We joke about making Toby stand next to the TV to improve our signal reception.   Yes. Inching my way slowly with my back to the wall.   Couldn't afford to lose him and Murray, we'll see if we can afford this price tag to keep Dez.    Haha, thanks! Doesn't matter how many times it falls out, it always grows back straight up :)      It also probably depends where in the US (or in the world) you live in. I'm a in a pet-friendly college town, so there's a lot less weight restrictions and plenty of single-floor/first-floor options.   Yeah, that's a fair assessment. I think most of those breeds do fall under or near 50 lbs, but it's definitely important to consider living situations (like you mentioned, stairs, etc.) :)  I would say this is just a starting point, not every dog here will be great in every situation...I think it's important to do a good bit of research on your intended dog type.   While your dismissive and critical tone doesn't warrant a gracious response, here are my thoughts anyway:  You're incorrect about the Boxers needs. It's generally recommended for Boxers to receive 45-60 minutes of exercise a day (more is always better of course). [[1]](http://www.allboxerinfo.com/boxer-dog-exercise) [[2]](http://www.atlantaboxerrescue.org/exercise.html)  I never said **all** of those breeds have **all** of those characteristics. It's a wide mix of dogs that in some way or another have some suitability for a young adult. I think the linked videos give a great breakdown of each breed, so you can learn about the tradeoffs there.  I never claimed to be an expert. If you're an expert, good for you, you're allowed to dissent. My recommendation would be to do so more cordially in the future.   While of course differing in looks/size, the breeds listed are similar in that they fit into some of the following categories: "friendly, easily trained, less vocal pooches with moderate activity needs".  Think of them as dogs that are lower down on the "maintenance requirements" list. I think the author's goal was to offer a widely varying selection of breeds :)  	38

    This is great, thank you for sharing! I'm not on that side of town very often but I would make a point to go so I can run into him.   I can't believe it! This solves every problem I've been having, especially with my boobs! Since starting keto, I've had to put ice packs on my chest every shark week and taking off my bra has become the *worst* part of my day.  Thank you so much for this, can't eat to try it!   Visit  http://www.drinkinganddriving.org/designated-driver-services/  and look up your city and state to find a local service to drive you home when you've been drinking.  Please call ahead to inquire about their services. You may need to reserve a ride in advance, or there may be other stipulations.   Any chance you could share the file you created for the laser? I have a Trotec 3000 I can use to make these!   Thank you very much for the pics, sadly it's far too large for my living room   Sounds tempting, got any pics?   There's a Broken Egg in River Ranch near Fresh Market!  They do serve alcohol at French Press, at least in the form of bloody Mary's and mimosas.   Everyone is going to say French Press but I found it horribly overpriced and the food was terrible. I was with a group of 6 people when I went. We all got different meals and sampled from one another's plate and agreed the only decent thing on the table was my god son's flapjacks.  It cost $40 for just my husband and myself to eat.  Another Broken Egg is fantastic and reasonably priced, but it's incredibly packed on the weekend mornings so get there early.   Welcome back, and best of luck! You're gonna crush it :D   Oh shit, rockey road?! I'm going to buy that immediately. I can live with 3 carbs if I'm having a snack attack.   It blends in my blender bottle really well, it just separates a within a few minutes so I down it pretty quickly.   My husband is also on keto but is weight lifting to build muscle. As many of you know, this can cause some problems in the muscle-growth department. Also, I have a nasty habit of not eating breakfast, and after being at work for a few hours I cave and eat cashews from a vending machine.   So he did a lot of research and found [Isopure](http://www.theisopurecompany.com/product/isopurezerocarb.html), an incredible low/zero carb protein powder that we could both drink in the morning without throwing our carbs off for the day.   The only one I've found in store that really has any carbs are the chocolate flavors, and they're 1 net carb per 2 scoops. All others (that I'm aware of) are zero carbs per two scoops.    If you aren't used to protein powder, the taste *will* throw you off, but you can acquire a taste for it. The flavors themselves are very good (my current favorite is Strawberries and Cream), but there is a very noticeable metallic after taste due to he other ingredients. I find it's best to have my coffee ready in the morning and drink a cup after I drink the powder.   The only true downside is the price. ~~The smaller "sample" bags are about $25, and depending on the flavor you can get 1 or 3 pound cans. I'm not sure on the price of the 1 pound cans, but I know the 3 pound is $60.~~   If you have any questions, I'll do my best to answer them. Hope this helps! KCKO 3  EDIT: I just checked Amazon, and the prices are apparently much better than in-store or I just got the prices totally wrong.  Example: 3 pound can of Mint Chocolate Chip 0g Carbs = $42.79 ($14.26 / Pound)   This sounds amazing and exactly what I've been looking for! What size do you form the balls into? How many cookies does the recipe yield?   This is my favorite answer here.   The interesting thing is in the commercial, they never once say it's supposed to cure headaches. They *only* say to apply it to your forehead.      Congratulations and welcome to Onederland!! Other people seem to know everything about weight loss, regardless if they've actually done the work to lose a large amount of weight and if they have, not one thing works for everyone. Good for you for sticking to your guns when you could have easily given up.   F / 5'2 / SW: 218.8 / CW: 199.8 / GW1: 170  I've been on Keto for for exactly 6 weeks today and I'm back in the 100's for the first time since August 2014!!  Since March 8th I've lost 19 lbs on the nose which is just unreal, both because of the short time and the fact that I used to be a die hard carb addict.  Here's the thing: I "cheat". Ive had a few slices of pizza, I've been eating chocolate since Easter, and I eat things without logging them first and later regret it when I do log it, thinking my whole day is ruiuned. But I KCKO, and I never once got "kicked out of keto." I kept losing weight. When you have a bad day, don't freak out and give up. KCKO is a saying around here for a reason!! Even if you screw up, DON'T GIVE UP!! You are still going to do great. The only way you won't reach your goal is if you quit trying.  I know it's hard when you're having a bad day, so look at some progress pics (yours or others), maybe plan what your next few meals will be, relax, and have faith in the system and the system will take care of you.  Lastly, and most important; please don't let the scale define your self worth. The scale is a 4 digit representation of your relationship with gravity. Losing weight is fantasict for your overall health and can make you so much more confident but no matter what it says, you must believe you are an amazing, beautiful person because YOU ARE!!   Good luck, I hope you reach every goal you've set for yourself and live a healthy, happy life!   /r/dominicnbp just created and posted this awesome guide to eating Keto at Wendy's!  http://nobunplease.com/keto-on-the-go-low-carb-options-at-wendys/   That's not my standard diet by any means, only for when I'm on the road and don't have any options. If there's a Jimmy Johns that's my go to. But yes all of the foods I listed are low carbs if ordered right and all fit my macros and calories for the day. Everyone's millage is gonna vary.  	21

Banks on her Donald Trump game; Trumplskillson.   Ed Sheeran V Bruno Mars Hell in the Cell THIS SUNDayyy   It's a bit different. Taylor was parlaying her music and huge fanbase to get paid by steaming companies. Nicki, Jay, and Kanye were trying to own a streaming service and drag their fans with them. They didn't offer exclusivity, they didn't offer a better product, and they didn't really offer much to sell it wither other than pretending like they were the founding fathers in a misjudged launch.  Taylor knows the biggest asset she has is her back catalog and album which moves actual physical product like no other pop artist. She uses it as leverage against Apple.   I'm not to convinced it's about race here. Nicki was trying to team up with people selling a product that everyone already has for free. Taylor uses a product everyone doesn't have because they expect it to be steamed most of the time. There's a scarcity of Talyor's music while there's a fuck ton of streaming services.

It's also a little on the nose that Nic Pizzaman would choose a song with the lyrics "I live among you / well disguised" and a shot of a red background with a woman behind a camera.  She keeps mentioning these surgeries. She probably had something to do with the sex ring once and those surgeries were a result of whatever happened in those rings.

"It has people in it." - Joe Brintano.   The Usual Suspects, Drive, Primer, No Country for Old Men, The Raid 2.  It looks like the circlejerk hit early.    The Jon Ronson-Alex Jones story is one of the funniest stories I've ever heard from him. And that's including the time he followed England's number one terror suspect who got bumped from his Islamic rally because Tom Jones' The Wonderful World of Horses was on the same day.   I believe in some world he has a chance or reeeeeeeeelly wants Hillary to win.   They hilarious thing about Trump is he got a bunch of politicians to talk about whether or not POW's are losers. Lindsay Graham is going on TV talking about how he believes POW's aren't losers. This huckster show is riotous. Best one of the season.  AND THEN, he kind of got John McCain to apologize for calling the people at Trump's rally crazies. Trump has managed to take advantage of a dysfunctional political system and a bunch of hypocritical lightweights who don't know what to do when faced with someone so stupidly brutish.   Trump basically tried to make the same insult he always tells people. That they're losers. And he's not wrong, John McCain lost. Trump just made a hilariously stupid comparison that all captured POW's are losers and the guys not captured are winners.    "My face is my warrant."   Trump will be managing a Panera bread in Peoria before this campagin is through.   He probably added, "They were all losers. Dummies."      Same lawyer for the actress attempting to nail Paul to the dirt is the one who got Erlich and Hendricks out of their Hooli deal.    It's amazing that the mods of Circlebroke actually modded some of those sub reddits.       This thread is basically a run down of Reddit's favorite movies that came out in the last two years...like every thread like this.    Grand Illusion.    So Silicon Valley and True Detective 2 share the same universe now.    The Red Pill is 120 thousand fit college educated middle class men. If we really wanted to we could invade New Zealand and install a new government. We definitely have the manpower. There are plenty of veterans here. Plus everyone here knows where the magazine release is on an M16, from years of playing Call Of Duty.  Realistically the Red Pill Reaction Force would be far more effective than half the world's militaries. The Afghan military is fucked up on opium. The Iraqi army cant even do jumping jacks. Plus New Zealand has only 8 thousand military personnel the majority of whom are useless paper pushers.  I don't actually support the violent overthrow of New Zealand.

I'm sure his team of orchestrators will have to work on it, but James Horner has done Westerns before (the obvious animated on notwithstanding). You should listen to The Missing. A really under rated masterpiece from Horner.    Oh, no. Reddit tyranny has arrived. The slippery slope has slipper'd! /s   He's a big ol' dipshit. AATA literally posts a topic that might as well say "Please ban me, I am lieterally breaking your rules REddit watchu gonna do?" and Reddit admins, typical to their nature, aren't doing much of anything.    It seems like Fuqua and Horner really got along. He was pretty much set for life after Titanic so he only took jobs with collaborators he already knew. You should listen to the NPR interview. He was really the type of guy that chose a movie because he would allow himself to feel every emotion in it.  But Fuqua was also kind of on the edge of tears when he said that Horner's team had delivered his final written score to Fuqua.   Action movies always do well overseas. It already bumped up its gross 100 million.                         see Paul Blart!  mall copp!                                If we ban pics of girls we should just do a sitewide ban of guy pics as well. We can't have feminists fingerbanging to underage boys.  In fact, let's just ban ANY pic just to be on the safe side.  This is really just a censorship issue. There's porn of all kinds on every single site out there. There's BARELY LEGAL TEEN porn which is extremely popular. Hell, even Brooke Shields and Traci Lords put underage porn into MAINSTREAM MOVIES.  Sure we shouldn't be sexualizing naked children, but if you're going to start banning legal content just for the sake of hoping to catch illegal content, how is that any different than an officer firing into the crowd of a fleeing robber with a shotgun just to make sure he gets the bad guy?  Do just like any other site: do your DUE DILIGENCE to remove any illegal content just as any site would. But it's definitely not your responsibility to police ALL content. That's just impossible. Even 4chan is notorious for DAILY KIDDIE PORN PICS. but the mods remove them as soon as they can because they CAN'T be held accountable for other people's posts otherwise reddit would likewise be held liable for ANY instance of an illegal pic.  Even Iggy Azalea made a child porn video where she tried to seduce an underage little boy with her pussy. That was allowed on YOUTUBE. So let's not get ahead of ourselves here. It's really not about the images themselves as much as the gatekeepers in charge of SEXUALIZING THE CONTEXT according to their feminist agenda.  I've seen pics on reddit of parents and strangers posting pics of naked kids playing in a bathtub or near the shower. If ALL naked children are to be removed, those would fall under 'illegal'.  If something is sexualizing a child in an obvious manner, we can remove it, no problem. But if someone is using their feminist liberal agenda to say "THAT is sexual TO ME" then we should tell them to fuck off. I mean social justice warriors support and still buy Lena Dunham's book where she admits to MOLESTING HER LITTLE SISTER. Except it's not considered molestation because the Social Justice Warriors are in charge of setting the context. Instead of Lena Dunham the CHILD MOLESTER touching her sister's vagina, it's warped into a fun childhood game of innocent curiosity. Again, it all depends on the gatekeepers interpretation of events.  Our goal should be to stand against censorship, not give it an excuse to GROW.   James Cameron produced "Sanctum" which came out around 10 million below the budget of AvP:2.   I imagine horror movies that exceed 50 million in cost is gonna make studios a little squeamish about their investment.    I wasn't talking about the quality of the film. I was talking about it's impact on the box office. This week three huge movies come out. It's not staying at number one. Jeez, have the ability to separate the two subjects.    They need to pay advertising and distributor costs as well as sharing revenue with theater chains. After that comes profit.    There's a real possibility it will do great. The only huge vehicle film that Adam Sandler did that is considered a flop was Blended. Pixels is a fun concept. It's aimed at kids and Adam Sandler is still a bankable money maker for Sony even if his movies are shit. I wouldn't put it past Paper Towns and Southpaw to also do some damage. The Fault in Our Stars made 302 million.    37 million users? How much does anyone want to bet 500 of those were actually active in adulterous relationships.    I blame Joey Greco.   Lot's of people seem to turn down James Cameron's ideas.    This movie seems like a dud. This week Adam Sandler, John Green and Southpaw raid the box office. Ant Man is toast. It will make the money back overseas, but domestically. It's days are numbered.    This is "fite me irl" material. It needs to be on a picture of Zack Snyder.

Usted no ha ledo * Paleo Me Plenty *. Usted no lo hace, por ejemplo, sabe otra gran rgimen de Snyder despedido, o por qu. Usted no est haciendo un esfuerzo para digerir verdad o participar en un dilogo permanente tanto como corroyendo l. Pero tal vez usted est sobre-rating Snyder como el ms grande director de levantamiento de todos los tiempos. Slo est arrancado, por lo tanto, la gente piensa que levanta. Aumento de volumen de Peter Jackson es lo mismo que la rutina perezosa 3x5 representante de Snyder.  Yo podra caer tanto la jerga de la aptitud avanzada en usted, sera hacer girar su cabeza, pero no lo har. En su lugar, voy a simplemente sealar que usted no sabe lo que cualquiera de los diferentes modos de ascensores muertos son, o cmo apoderarse de la regeneracin del tejido muscular. Nunca se ha ledo y no sabes que gente como Miln de Crotona, Galeno, o Frederic Delavier son- y esos son slo los biggies. Usted ha ledo / visto casi nada de entrenamiento con pesas clsico, si lo hay. Ciertamente no escolsticamente. Usted googled algo de mierda sobre un fsico de admiracin y copiar / pegar algo escrito en / r / fitness que usted no tiene ninguna base para la comprensin. T- s, el poco producto mudo, ciego, al abrigo de la industria de ejercicio que usted es, contribuir a nuestra degradacin del tejido muscular del mundo y. (Ni siquiera sabes lo que eso significa, porque no sabes lo que es una buena forma). Insultas lo que eres ignorante acerca. Y eso es una cosa de mierda que hacer. Le sugiero que tome un inventario personal honesto y, a continuacin, tratar de hacer algo mejor de ti mismo. Porque ahora mismo, eres jodidamente asqueroso de leer. Honestamente, creo que deberas estar avergonzado de ti mismo, y debe considerar pedir disculpas a este hilo.   Bud, you have no clue what you're talking about. You haven't read *Why Lift* and therefore haven't the first fucking clue with which ethical/aesthetic criteria Snyder was dismissive of traditional workout conventions. You haven't read *Paleo Me Plenty*. You don't, for example, know another great regimen Snyder dismissed, or why. You aren't making an effort to truly digest or engage in an ongoing dialogue so much as corroding it. But perhaps you're over-rating Snyder as the greatest lifting director of all time. He's just ripped, therefore people think he lifts. Peter Jackson's bulking is just the same as Snyder's lazy 3x5 rep routine.  I could drop so much advanced fitness jargon on you, it would make your head spin, but I won't. Instead, I'll simply point out that you don't know what any of the different modes of dead lifts are, or how they seize upon muscle tissue regeneration. You've never read and don't know who people like Milo of Croton, Galen, or Frederic Delavier are- and those are just the biggies. You've read/seen next to no classic weight training, if any. Certainly not scholastically. You googled some shit about admiring physiques and copy/pasted something written in /r/fitness that you have no basis for understanding. You- yes the dumb, blind, sheltered little product of the exercise industry that you are, contribute to our world's and muscle tissue degradation. (You don't even know what that means because you don't know what good form is). You insult what you're ignorant about. And that's a really shitty thing to do. I suggest you take an honest personal inventory, and then try to make something better of yourself. Because right now, you're pretty fucking disgusting to read. Honestly, I think you should be ashamed of yourself, and should consider apologizing to this thread.    Bud, you have no clue what you're talking about.

No one's arguing that.  As someone who is on the internet who reads /r/politics, I am telling you, specifically, in the Berniesphere, no one calls Sanders a socialist. If you want to be "specific" like you said, then you shouldn't either. They're not the same thing.  If you're saying "socialist family" you're referring to the political grouping of leaders who aren't scumbags, which includes things from Democratic Socialists to unions to Europeans.  So your reasoning for calling Sanders a socialist is because random people "call the raising the minimum wage socialism?" Let's get free broadband and healthcare in there, then, too.  Also, calling Donald Trump an average Republican or a racist? It's not one or the other, that's not how politics works. He's both. Bernie is a Social Democrat and a member of the socialist family. But that's not what you said. You said Sanders is a socialist, which is not true unless you're okay with calling everyone who isn't a a corporate puppet a socialist, which means you'd call Ron Paul, Alex Jones, and /r/politics socialists, too. Which you said you don't.  It's okay to just admit you're a corporate shill, you know?    + /u/User_Simulator  /u/test_subject9527   Do you motherfuckers understand now? DO YOU?

That morning, she called her dad to ask if our youngest daughter, who stayed the night with him last night, could remain at his house until this evening. She mentioned that she and I were going to be out of town and, when he asked where we were going, she nonchalantly said that we were going to see Bernie Sanders speak. Her father, who is probably a 2%er, flipped a biscuit. He started screaming that he could not believe that his daughter would even entertain the idea of voting for a 'self-described socialist who wants to make the entire country a welfare state.' My wife, who is pretty easily flustered, allowed him to vent. She then stated that, 'he hasn't earned my vote yet, daddykins, I just want to hear what he has to say.' Her father then yelled, 'if you go that rally, you are out of the will!' (He's generally a calm person; I personally think he'd been drinking, but he is very much right wing). My wife then said something I will never forget: 'Bernie Sanders can't be bought. What makes you think I can, daddy-o? The threat of me losing my inheritance is not going to stop me from doing what is right. I am going and the fact that you are threatening me is undemocratic and not very dank.' He then promptly hung up on her. Then everyone applauded and gave her a $100% bill. My wife's name? Albert Einstein. I LOVE MY WIFE!!!

There is no doubt that at this point our professor, DeShawn Washington, wished he had pulled himself up by his bootstraps and become more than a sophist liberal professor.

Eh, maybe not in the height department but I can assure you I've grown more than most people will in the more important categories. My intelligence, for example, has grown to the point where I am now a revered member of my local MENSA branch and have astonished many learned experts in various scientifical fields with insights formed after only a cursory glance at their field of study. I read the entire works of authors such as James Joyce, Albert Camus, Stephen King and George Orwell before my teenage years. I was awarded a delta for the first CMV post I ever made, and I only really argue with people on Reddit for my own amusement. Perhaps you'd like to hear about my stunning and exponential growth in the weights room, too? How about my success with maidens from all over Europe? You probably like to make jokes about your height at my expense because it's the only thing you have going for you. So yeah, you might be taller than me, but at the end of the day, do I care? No. I have more important things to worry about, like the one million word novel I'm currently writing, adding to my $50,000 wardrobe, or adding to my impressive list of bullet hell game regional hiscores.   + /u/User_Simulator  /u/test_subject9527   I'm not sure if you're trolling or just have no idea who I am, but I'm going to give you the benefit of the doubt. In addition to almost 7 years as a confessed meme addict, I have moderated the largest meme forum on the Internet (at over 2 million subscribers) for over a year. You think I don't know memes? In that time I have removed over 400posts for not following subreddit guidelines. In addition to my moderation responsibilities I am one of the most active writers on knowyourmeme.com. You think I don't know memes? Then how do I write articles about them on a site called knowyourmeme? Several mainstream blogs have contacted me to ask about the recent meme phenomenon and each has been thankful and enlightened with what I had to tell them. It's not just limited to blogs though. Several companies have asked me to review their meme ads to avoid a failure like Toyota's meme commercial. Just last week a major food company contacted me with a paid offer to help them on a new ad campaign. I declined when I researched the company and saw that they had contributed money to socially conservative groups. It's safe to say that I am one of the world's foremost experts on memes and in fact there is no one I can think of that has a meme resume as impressive as mine. So please tell me, what are your qualifications to say that I don't know what a meme is?  + /u/User_Simulator  /u/test_subject9527   Sponsors will never buy ads on Reddit now that it's banned. That was like the sub holding this whole operation together.    New thread: "Why do Nas and Common have to rap about black people and sturggle? White people struggle too. God, why cant they be egalitarian?"   So you have figured out that the majority of /r/atheism isn't very happy with religion and believe that religions are pretty silly. You might find some of this shit offensive even. You might even feel that you need to post about how much /r/atheism sucks.  I have a 10 step plan in order for you to correct this issue.  1. Go fuck yourself. This is a crucial step, and will be recommended should you decide to openly voice your concerns about /r/atheism. Might as well get this out of the way so when it is recommended, you can proudly claim 'I've done that already' and the discussion can continue. A broken bottle is ideal, but whatever tool you have available it fine, even if it is a portal gun.  2. Repeat step 1 to ensure completion.  3. Unsubscribe. You don't HAVE to be here, you don't HAVE to read the memes, sagan quotes, and dumbasses on facebook. Red button on the right. Go away, we don't want you.  4. Repeat step 1 again.  5. Understand our user base. If you live in the UK, you might legitimately not understand a LARGE portion of our users. Google the Bible belt. I will wait..... Ok, that's long enough. There are many atheist teens in the Bible belt, whom stay in the proverbial closet to prevent bad shit from happening to them. This includes something as trivial as being cut off from college (which in the US is not a right, but a paid privilege), to something as sever as being thrown in the streets or (in the rare case) murdered. There have been users on here asking for help due to parents wanting to involuntarily commit them to a psyche ward for their atheism. This subreddit is for them to vent.  6. Repeat step 1  7. We have every reason to hate religion. While we don't necessarily hate religious people, we do find their beliefs silly and worth mocking. However, religion is responsible for many deaths in Iran, Sudan, and the Bible Belt, especially among this particular faith known as Christian Science, which believes prayer is a legitimate alternative to MEDICINE and SURGERY, which sometimes ends up killing the unfortunate kid.  8. Repeat step one, one last time.  9. If you are still here and have concerns, discuss. If not, unsubscribe button is on the right, have a nice day and don't forget to go fuck yourself.  10. Go fuck yourself.   + /u/User_Simulator  /u/test_subject9527   So I was standing in a rather large line at my local Wal-Mart today behind a couple families that I know from when I went to church with my family in year younger. It was the only register open so there wasn't much of another option to get my 12 pack of Mountain Dew for a party I was heading to. I was wondering why the line was going nowhere when I decided to poke my head up front to see what the holdup was. It was a little old lady who didn't have enough for her groceries and she was trying to talk the cashier into letting her get away with being short. This struck me as odd until I found out she was a mere $0.21 short of her purchase. Now all these families were just staring and there was even two making fun of her. I walked up and handed my soda to the cashier, handed him a $5 and told her to keep the change. One of the middle aged women (I knew these people, so I also knew that they all make over 6 digits) grabbed her kid and yelled very loudly, "See that man? He's acting just like Jesus wants us to." For some reason this set me off, so I turned around. I haven't shaved in awhile so I'm rocking some nice scruff, a Slayer shirt, and gym shorts, so it must have been a nice sight. Very loudly, I said "Like Jesus? Ma'am I'm an atheist who makes minimum wage and I was the one who stepped up to help her? Your hypocritical Christianity is an inspiration to us all." As I stormed out, a couple of the cart boys started to whistle and cheer, soon shoppers joined in and even the cashier. I gave a wave and went off with a feeling of accomplishment.   + /u/User_Simulator  /u/test_subject9527   Listen closely, my fellow brethren: do not despair. today is a dark day indeed.

That said.  In 7th grade, I took an SAT test without preparing for it at all, it was spur-of-the-moment, I knew about it about an hour ahead of time and didn't do any research or anything. I scored higher on it than the average person using it to apply for college in my area.  An IQ test has shown me to be in the 99.9th percentile for IQ. This is the highest result the test I was given reaches; anything further and they'd consider it to be within the margin of error for that test.  My mother's boyfriend of 8 years is an aerospace engineer who graduated Virginia Tech. At the age of 15, I understand physics better than him, and I owe very little of it to him, as he would rarely give me a decent explanation of anything, just tell me that my ideas were wrong and become aggravated with me for not quite understanding thermodynamics. He's not particularly successful as an engineer, but I've met lots of other engineers who aren't as good as me at physics, so I'm guessing that's not just a result of him being bad at it.  I'm also pretty good at engineering. I don't have a degree, and other than physics I don't have a better understanding of any aspect of engineering than any actual engineer, but I have lots of ingenuity for inventing new things. For example, I independently invented regenerative brakes before finding out what they were, and I was only seven or eight years old when I started inventing wireless electricity solutions (my first idea being to use a powerful infrared laser to transmit energy; admittedly not the best plan).  I have independently thought of basically every branch of philosophy I've come across. Every question of existentialism which I've seen discussed in SMBC or xkcd or Reddit or anywhere else, the thoughts haven't been new to me. Philosophy has pretty much gotten trivial for me; I've considered taking a philosophy course just to see how easy it is.  Psychology, I actually understand better than people with degrees. Unlike engineering, there's no aspect of psychology which I don't have a very good understanding of. I can debunk many of even Sigmund Freud's theories.  I'm a good enough writer that I'm writing a book and so far everybody who's read any of it has said it was really good and plausible to expect to have published. And that's not just, like, me and family members, that counts strangers on the Internet. I've heard zero negative appraisal of it so far; people have critiqued it, but not insulted it.  I don't know if that will suffice as evidence that I'm intelligent. I'm done with it, though, because I'd rather defend my maturity, since it's what you've spent the most time attacking. The following are some examples of my morals and ethical code.  I believe firmly that everybody deserves a future. If we were to capture Hitler at the end of WWII, I would be against executing him. In fact, if we had any way of rehabilitating him and knowing that he wasn't just faking it, I'd even support the concept of letting him go free. This is essentially because I think that whoever you are in the present is a separate entity from who you were in the past and who you are in the future, and while your present self should take responsibility for your past self's actions, it shouldn't be punished for them simply for the sake of punishment, especially if the present self regrets the actions of the past self and feels genuine guilt about them.  I don't believe in judgement of people based on their personal choices as long as those personal choices aren't harming others. I don't have any issue with any type of sexuality whatsoever (short of physically acting out necrophilia, pedophilia, or other acts which have a harmful affect on others - but I don't care what a person's fantasies consist of, as long as they recognize the difference between reality and fiction and can separate them). I don't have any issue with anybody over what type of music they listen to, or clothes they wear, etc. I know that's not really an impressive moral, but it's unfortunately rare; a great many people, especially those my age, are judgmental about these things.  I love everyone, even people I hate. I wish my worst enemies good fortune and happiness. Rick Perry is a vile, piece of shit human being, deserving of zero respect, but I wish for him to change for the better and live the best life possible. I wish this for everyone.  I'm pretty much a pacifist. I've taken a broken nose without fighting back or seeking retribution, because the guy stopped punching after that. The only time I'll fight back is if 1) the person attacking me shows no signs of stopping and 2) if I don't attack, I'll come out worse than the other person will if I do. In other words, if fighting someone is going to end up being more harmful to them than just letting them go will be to me, I don't fight back. I've therefore never had a reason to fight back against anyone in anything serious, because my ability to take pain has so far made it so that I'm never in a situation where I'll be worse off after a fight. If I'm not going to get any hospitalizing injuries, I really don't care.  The only exception is if someone is going after my life. Even then, I'll do the minimum amount of harm to them that I possibly can in protecting myself. If someone points a gun at me and I can get out of it without harming them, I'd prefer to do that over killing them.  I consider myself a feminist. I don't believe in enforced or uniform gender roles; they may happen naturally, but they should never be coerced into happening unnaturally. As in, the societal pressure for gender roles should really go, even if it'll turn out that the majority of relationships continue operating the same way of their own accord. I treat women with the same outlook I treat men, and never participate in the old Reddit "women are crazy" circlejerk, because there are multiple women out there and each have different personalities just like there are multiple men out there and each with different personalities. I don't think you do much of anything except scare off the awesome women out there by going on and on about the ones who aren't awesome.  That doesn't mean I look for places to victimize women, I just don't believe it's fair to make generalizations such as the one about women acting like everything's OK when it's really not (and that's a particularly harsh example, because all humans do that).  I'm kind of tired of citing these examples and I'm guessing you're getting tired of reading them, if you've even made it this far. In closing, the people who know me in real life all respect me, as do a great many people in the Reddit brony community, where I spend most of my time and where I'm pretty known for being helpful around the community. A lot of people in my segment of the community are depressed or going through hard times, and I spend a lot of time giving advice and support to people there. Yesterday someone quoted a case of me doing this in a post asking everyone what their favorite motivational/inspirational quote was, and that comment was second to the top, so I guess other people agreed (though, granted, it was a pretty low-traffic post, only about a dozen competing comments).  And, uh, I'm a pretty good moderator.  All that, and I think your behavior in this thread was totally assholish. So what do you think, now that you at least slightly know me?    + /u/User_Simulator  /u/test_subject9527    I honestly think I have a serious problem in regards to this. I have ALWAYS wanted to smells women's panties for as long as I can remember. I remember that their was this hot teachers assistant in my preschool and I always wanted to sniff her chair after she would get up, I came really close to doing it a couple times. Then the first time I actually got a hold of some real panties was at my friends house when I was around 15, his mom would go jogging in the same sweats everyday and leave the thong she had worn right next to the sweats. I still remember that pungent smell of her vagina and that stinky smell of her ass, her vagina would always leave behind globs of cumm on the sweats and panties and I would run my teeth across it to scrape it off and taste her sweet cumm. Oh and by the way my friends mom was HOTT, I don't mean conventional hot I mean pornstar hot, I put a post of her on /r/milf[1] and she got close to 1000 upvotes, me and another friend think she bares a striking resemblance to Lisa Ann. Then at my other friends house I walked into his bathroom and their in the hamper were his sisters dirty panties. I stayed in the toilet for an hour smelling and licking them, THOSE were the best panties I have ever smelled. She was 23 and her panties were these extra small super bright colored hollitster panties and they had streaks on the vagina part but most importantly they had streaks on the ass crack part, not poo stains but rather sweat ass stains. But my most recent venture in smelling panties has been my mother in laws panties, my wifes mother. She's definitely a milf too but more of a real life "hot mom", and every chance I get (lets say her mother in law is sleeping and my wife is in the bathroom I) I rummage through her hamper and take a pair out and steal them to jerk off with. Her mom is pretty hot she's thick but in a good way, she has a flat stomach but a HUGE ass she wears a XL thong. My wife has a huge ass too and I'm talking about actually big (she's from Brazil) but my mother in law's ass is godly, she would put Kim K away no exaggeration. I just love to picture that tight thong swallowed up in her ass and collecting that sweet ass sweat and stench. I'm waaaaaaaaaaaaay more obsessed with the whole ass smell, I just love thinking that the panties have been rubbing up against that particular women's asshole all day. Don't get me wrong I'm not into shit or feces, what I like is the asshole and that stench a women might get from showing in the morning, then doing errands all day and finally working out to get that natural animal like stench oozing out of their ass crack. I really like the smell of a women when she is bent over doggy style and her ass stinks and the smell is wafting up to my nose with every thrust. Every time I have sex with my wife I eat out her asshole EVERYTIME, that is unless she feels really dirty because she hasn't showered has diarrhea or some thing like that. I am currently majoring in psychology and a couple years ago I pinpointed why I have this obsession with panties and the anal area.   + /u/User_Simulator  /u/test_subject9527    should be noted that I've upvoted every single person who's disagreed with me here, as far as I know. That said. In 7th grade, I took an SAT test without preparing for it at all, it was spur-of-the-moment, I knew about it about an hour ahead of time and didn't do any research or anything. I scored higher on it than the average person using it to apply for college in my area. An IQ test has shown me to be in the 99.9th percentile for IQ. This is the highest result the test I was given reaches; anything further and they'd consider it to be within the margin of error for that test. My mother's boyfriend of 8 years is an aerospace engineer who graduated Virginia Tech. At the age of 15, I understand physics better than him, and I owe very little of it to him, as he would rarely give me a decent explanation of anything, just tell me that my ideas were wrong and become aggravated with me for not quite understanding thermodynamics. He's not particularly successful as an engineer, but I've met lots of other engineers who aren't as good as me at physics, so I'm guessing that's not just a result of him being bad at it. I'm also pretty good at engineering. I don't have a degree, and other than physics I don't have a better understanding of any aspect of engineering than any actual engineer, but I have lots of ingenuity for inventing new things. For example, I independently invented regenerative brakes before finding out what they were, and I was only seven or eight years old when I started inventing wireless electricity solutions (my first idea being to use a powerful infrared laser to transmit energy; admittedly not the best plan). I have independently thought of basically every branch of philosophy I've come across. Every question of existentialism which I've seen discussed in SMBC or xkcd or Reddit or anywhere else, the thoughts haven't been new to me. Philosophy has pretty much gotten trivial for me; I've considered taking a philosophy course just to see how easy it is. Psychology, I actually understand better than people with degrees. Unlike engineering, there's no aspect of psychology which I don't have a very good understanding of. I can debunk many of even Sigmund Freud's theories. I'm a good enough writer that I'm writing a book and so far everybody who's read any of it has said it was really good and plausible to expect to have published. And that's not just, like, me and family members, that counts strangers on the Internet. I've heard zero negative appraisal of it so far; people have critiqued it, but not insulted it. I don't know if that will suffice as evidence that I'm intelligent. I'm done with it, though, because I'd rather defend my maturity, since it's what you've spent the most time attacking. The following are some examples of my morals and ethical code. I believe firmly that everybody deserves a future. If we were to capture Hitler at the end of WWII, I would be against executing him. In fact, if we had any way of rehabilitating him and knowing that he wasn't just faking it, I'd even support the concept of letting him go free. This is essentially because I think that whoever you are in the present is a separate entity from who you were in the past and who you are in the future, and while your present self should take responsibility for your past self's actions, it shouldn't be punished for them simply for the sake of punishment, especially if the present self regrets the actions of the past self and feels genuine guilt about them. I don't believe in judgement of people based on their personal choices as long as those personal choices aren't harming others. I don't have any issue with any type of sexuality whatsoever (short of physically acting out necrophilia, pedophilia, or other acts which have a harmful affect on others - but I don't care what a person's fantasies consist of, as long as they recognize the difference between reality and fiction and can separate them). I don't have any issue with anybody over what type of music they listen to, or clothes they wear, etc. I know that's not really an impressive moral, but it's unfortunately rare; a great many people, especially those my age, are judgmental about these things. I love everyone, even people I hate. I wish my worst enemies good fortune and happiness. Rick Perry is a vile, piece of shit human being, deserving of zero respect, but I wish for him to change for the better and live the best life possible. I wish this for everyone. I'm pretty much a pacifist. I've taken a broken nose without fighting back or seeking retribution, because the guy stopped punching after that. The only time I'll fight back is if 1) the person attacking me shows no signs of stopping and 2) if I don't attack, I'll come out worse than the other person will if I do. In other words, if fighting someone is going to end up being more harmful to them than just letting them go will be to me, I don't fight back. I've therefore never had a reason to fight back against anyone in anything serious, because my ability to take pain has so far made it so that I'm never in a situation where I'll be worse off after a fight. If I'm not going to get any hospitalizing injuries, I really don't care. The only exception is if someone is going after my life. Even then, I'll do the minimum amount of harm to them that I possibly can in protecting myself. If someone points a gun at me and I can get out of it without harming them, I'd prefer to do that over killing them. I consider myself a feminist. I don't believe in enforced or uniform gender roles; they may happen naturally, but they should never be coerced into happening unnaturally. As in, the societal pressure for gender roles should really go, even if it'll turn out that the majority of relationships continue operating the same way of their own accord. I treat women with the same outlook I treat men, and never participate in the old Reddit "women are crazy" circlejerk, because there are multiple women out there and each have different personalities just like there are multiple men out there and each with different personalities. I don't think you do much of anything except scare off the awesome women out there by going on and on about the ones who aren't awesome. That doesn't mean I look for places to victimize women, I just don't believe it's fair to make generalizations such as the one about women acting like everything's OK when it's really not (and that's a particularly harsh example, because all humans do that). I'm kind of tired of citing these examples and I'm guessing you're getting tired of reading them, if you've even made it this far. In closing, the people who know me in real life all respect me, as do a great many people in the Reddit brony community, where I spend most of my time and where I'm pretty known for being helpful around the community. A lot of people in my segment of the community are depressed or going through hard times, and I spend a lot of time giving advice and support to people there. Yesterday someone quoted a case of me doing this in a post asking everyone what their favorite motivational/inspirational quote was, and that comment was second to the top, so I guess other people agreed (though, granted, it was a pretty low-traffic post, only about a dozen competing comments). And, uh, I'm a pretty good moderator. All that, and I think your behavior in this thread was totally assholish. So what do you think, now that you at least slightly know me?   + /u/User_Simulator  /u/test_subject9527    What the fuck did you just fucking say about me, you little bitch?

I am trained in gorilla warfare and Im the top sniper in the entire US armed forces. You are nothing to me but just another target. I will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet? Think again, fucker.

Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the United States Marine Corps and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little clever comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue.

If we really wanted to we could invade Hollywood and install a new government. We definitely have the manpower. There are plenty of /r/Movies[2] Veterans here. Plus everyone here knows how to throw a punch with the right hand, from years of watching Fight Club. Realistically the /r/Movies[3] Reaction Force would be far more effective than half the world's cinephiles. The /r/TrueFilm[4] cinephiles are fucked up on opium. The /r/Flicks[5] cinephiles cant even do jumping jacks. Plus Hollywood has only 8 thousand film critics, the majority of whom are useless paper pushers. I don't actually support the violent overthrow of Hollywood. I just think its kind of a fun idea conceptualy.   + /u/User_Simulator  /u/test_subject9527   Y'know, after reading all these Age of Ultron reviews where non-fans complained about how insular, incoherent and confusing the film was, it's starting to seem like the deeper we go into these films the more exclusionary they are going to become to normal fans.   The inclusion of deep cut Marvel characters like Ulysses Klaw, Ultron, or The Vision just confuses these people. To them these characters seem really undeveloped or shallow, but to fans the characters have already been very, very meticulously developed, so we don't really need all that much exposition to make sense of it. Almost as if the films were made specifically for us.  When the film says "Ultron is going to Wakanda to get vibranium by way of Ulysses Klaw." The normie says to himself, "What? Who? I have no idea what any of those things are or why Ultron is doing that." While the fan says, "Yeah, if Ultron wants to create world peace by wiping out all human life, and vibranium is key to his plan, he may want to hit up Klaw, since he's stolen a shitload of the substance over the years. Makes sense."  Eventually we're going to get to the point where the normies just don't care anymore because they're too confused and don't want to do the homework That's going to result in a drop off in the amount of money these films make. There's still plenty of people out there who will go see these films, and I'm sure that will always justify spending two-hundred million dollars on them, so they're always going to be around, but they're going to become a lot more like actual comics. Impenetrable for people who aren't deeply immersed in this universe.   You know what I say to that?   GOOD.   I don't care if normies are into this shit. I don't really want these characters to be massive, ubiquitous pulp culture phenomenons if that means we have to spend an entire film expositing to people who don't know what's going on.   These films should be made for the fans. People who aren't hostile to the notion of an extended, interconnected film universe that requires a familiarity with what has come before. Let the normies go back to watching sports, or the Bachelor or whatever the fuck the were into before this stuff came along.   If they're tired of playing with the toys I've been playing with since I was 6, then I'll take them back. No problem.   Here's the thing. You said a "drywood termite is subterranean." Is it in the same family? Yes. No one's arguing that. As someone who is a scientist who studies termites, I am telling you, specifically, in science, no one calls drywoods subterraneans. If you want to be "specific" like you said, then you shouldn't either. They're not the same thing. If you're saying "termite family" you're referring to the taxonomic grouping of Dictyopera, which includes things from to cockroaches to mantises. So your reasoning for calling a drywood a subterranean is because random people "call the eusocial ones termites?" Let's get bees and ants in there, then, too. Also, calling someone a human or an ape? It's not one or the other, that's not how taxonomy works. They're both. A subterranean termite is a subterranean and a member of the Dictyoptera family. But that's not what you said. You said a subterranean is a drywood termite, which is not true unless you're okay with calling all members of the Dictyoptera family termites, which means you'd call mantises, cockroaches and other bugs termites, too. Which you said you don't. It's okay to just admit you're wrong, you know?    + /u/User_Simulator  /u/test_subject9527  	199

 It's good to hear someone returned to "normal" fairly quick!  The one thing I love about BC is that I don't get many period symptoms. I started BC because of terrible cramps. Definitely not looking forward to that again. Ugh! And why must PMS and early pregnancy be so damn similar?!   Thank you! I'll definitely check out the book.    I went with my husband in May. I was really nervous because I have bad social anxiety as well. We were seated in a corner where there were only two other tables. Our waiter, "Uncle" Dale, was amazing. He was a nice older gentleman. He didn't do anything that made me feel uncomfortable. He never called us out on anything, though we watched our elbows and we ended up eating everything. He commented on our huge appetites. The other two tables kept him busy - both of the other families had really intricate allergies so he spent a lot of time talking to them about food options. Anyway, he provided a really positive experience, no public humiliation whatsoever. I definitely think they can tell how much you want to participate.    This is the best comment.    Agreed. We put it back in a little longer after I took a pic because we realized the dough wasn't completely done   I'll have to ask my husband if he has the recipe   One thing that's really bothering me right now is when to go off birth control. I've been on the pill since I was 15, so about 8 years now. For most of that time I was on a pill where I would only have like 3 periods a year. Last year I switch to Generess Fe and started having periods every month for the first time in a long, long time. My brand was just recently switched to Layolis Fe.  I really want to go off BC because I want to start tracking my cycle. I don't know why, but I have a HUGE fear that my cycles won't be regular. I also think my BC is giving me acne - I started getting cystic acne when I switched pills last year, and my acne flares the same time every month (the second week on active pills, which seems odd?). I'm also curious if going off the pill will help my headaches.   Obviously there are also reasons to stay on the pill though. For one, my prescription is free. I used to pay $25 a month, but as of a few months ago it's now free. If I go off the pill, we'd have to pay for condoms or we'd have to be super careful about preventing. Also, what if by some sheer luck get pregnant right away? I mean, I'd be super excited, but I'd really prefer to keep waiting until we're closing to having a house.   Ugh. It's such a complicated decision!   So, how did you decide when to go off the pill? Are you waiting until you're ready to start trying? Or did you go off a bit early to start tracking? Also, is anyone willing to share their experience going off pill?   Help me stop worrying about ovulating after going off the pill!   There's tomato buried somewhere under all that cheese...      Don't do it! I spent two hours on there one night just looking at baby items. It's addicting.     When has he ever been sickly and weak? Just because he lost a fight as a 15 year old boy to a 20 year old man? Because he's not built?    There is indication he was a small, weak, sickly boy. Littlefinger sees himself as a weak boy from a small family who ended up becoming powerful. Also, remember S4E8 when Littlefinger says "Sickly little boys sometimes become powerful men"? He wasn't just talking about Robin; he was referring to himself.   Mind absolutely blown.   Haha sorry I went overboard! I'm happy to help.    (oh crapthis ending up being SUPER FREAKING LONG. But I hope its somewhat useful)  Oh man, I love this topic! I cannot stop obsessing over finances. I've only been looking at the first year though, so many someone else can help with the rest. Oh, please keep in mind that Im not a financial person, Im just a normal woman who loves researching the shit out of finances. So take what I have to say with a grain of salt.  First off, stay away from personal finance. Some people there can be ruthless. I once saw a pregnant woman seek advice there for an unexpected baby and they all told her to get an abortion. WTF?  In 2010, the USDA estimated that the average middle-income family spends $12,000 in the first year of a baby's life. Yikes! But it's so tough to calculate the exact cost of a baby because it varies from person to person.   [Here is a lovely baby cost calculator to help you figure out about how much you'll need for your baby's first year](http://www.babycenter.com/baby-cost-calculator).  I think one of the biggest reasons that number is so high is because of child care. It can be ridiculously expensive, and the younger the child the more expensive it is. For many people it seems most of their monthly income goes toward childcare. I've seen numbers as high as $2,000 a month (the fuck?!), but it depends on where you live. If you plan to use daycare, maybe look online, call around, or ask around to see what typical costs are in your specific area. Obviously, if you do not use daycare of whatever, you're going to save a ton of money right off the bat.   The cost will also vary depending on whether you chose cloth diapers vs disposible. Someone over on BabyBumps just put together a [wonderful chart that compares the prices of diapers](http://i1265.photobucket.com/albums/jj513/elfer1/2015-07-14%2011_39_47-Diaper%20Comparison%20-%20Google%20Sheets_zpszpzwha9e.png).   There are estimates out there on how many diapers a baby goes through the first year. [ToysRUs has a chart on their website](http://www.toysrus.com/shop/index.jsp?categoryId=10872434) that breaks down numbers. Estimates show you'll need about 2,788 disposible diapers for the first year, which costs about $550, based on paying an average of $.20 per diaper. For wipes, I've read it's best to buy bulk. People have suggested to never pay more than $.02 per individual wipe.   I personally dont plan on cloth diapering, but it can save a TON. I have read that it costs about $381 to cloth diaper a child from birth to potty training. In comparison, it can cost $2,500 for disposable diapers from birth to potty training. Cloth diapering is especially useful if you plan on having more than one child. You buy all the cloth diapers for your first child and you can reuse the diapers for the second. [Here is a website that shows the price differences on cloth diapers]( http://www.diaperdecisions.com/pages/cost_of_cloth_diapers.php).  Formula... I cannot gauge prices on formula because it depends on what baby can tolerate. I've seen prices as cheap as $50 a month to formula feed, but I've also seen people pay ridiculous amounts (like $500 a month) because baby is allergic to things and needs a very special formula. Ugh. Breastfeeding can obviously save you a ton of money.   Hospital costs   doctors visits can be factors too I guess - will your insurance pay for most everything or are you going to have to foot a lot of the bill? Ive seen couples pay nothing out of pocket for the entire pregnancy + birth, and Ive seen couples pay $10,000 just for the birth. I recommend contacting your insurance in advance of pregnancy and see what all they cover so you know what you can expect to pay.  Then it depends what you want to buy for baby. Do you really have to buy all the toys for your baby? For some, an empty formula can will provide hours of entertainment and saves you money on toys.   Does everything have to be brand new or are you okay with used and hand-me-downs? You can save a ton of money buying used. Some people buy things they end up not using and instead of returning them they just put the items on Craigslist or whatever  allowing you to buy things basically brand new at a much cheaper price. You know those mamaRoos that cost $200 brand new? You can find them on Craigslist almost brand new for under $100!   Anyway, the USDA says I'll spend $12,000 on our baby...but I'm calculating that we shouldn't need more than $5,000 for the first year (and even that sounds a bit high). The point is that the cost is different for every family.   You're not a downer. I didn't think about that before. Your comment is actually eye-opening and I like the brutal honesty. I know I need to work on actually making changes instead of just pushing through, and I'm honestly trying. I tried to get professional help in the past and it failed, which absolutely crushed me. I'm finally starting to find the courage again to try to learn how to actually overcome anxiety.   In short, thank you for reminding me that "just pushing through" isn't enough.   I'm a long time lurker, never really introduced myself. I'm a 23-year-old female. I've been struggling with anxiety since my early teenage years, but it seems to have gotten worse since sustaining a concussion. Now a days it seems to manifest physically (headaches, neck pain, stomach pain/IBS, dizziness, lightheadedness, hot flashes, all that jazz). I am extremely on edge whenever I go out, so I like to hide away in my apartment, where I just sit around and dread my next social interaction.  Anyway... I currently volunteer with an animal rescue group by writing adoption biographies of the animals and posting them online, which in and of itself makes me nervous as hell. Last night though, the woman in charge forwarded an adoption application and asked me to contact the 3 references and interview them. Calling 3 strangers and actually talking to them? INSTANT PANIC!!! I've been dreading it for the last 12+ hours, but I finally forced myself to sit down and call the references. Happily, I executed the interviews without sounding like a complete idiot.   I feel so stupid for being proud of myself for doing something as "simple" as calling people. More than anything, I'm proud that I'm finally trying to conquer my anxiety. This is a huge accomplishment.    Second this. I'm 23, been married for 2 years, still on parents insurance since it's currently the best option.    DH bet me yesterday that I can't go a whole day without talking about babies. It's not going so well :(   Congrats!

I also have terrible anxiety. Magnesium seems to help people with migraines, depression, and anxiety so I've added a magnesium supplement to my diet. I feel like my headaches are less severe now a days. It could possibly help with bipolar disorder too. Maybe ask your doctor if it's worth a try.    How exciting! My college professor is a contributing writer.   Today, DH and I were texting while he was at work. Out of the blue, he sent me a link to a gun he was looking at (no surprise; he's always looking at guns or hunting stuff). In reply, I sent him a picture of [this onesie](http://i.imgur.com/sJPHyk8.jpg) one of the local hospitals is giving to babies born during the MLB All Star Week. Guess which one of us has baby rabies?  	23
    The moment before death is one of the most terrifying parts of dying. I know this experience first hand. Let me first start off by explaining a few things. I was 16. About to make the biggest mistake of my life. Not Sex. Not Drinking and driving, some thing else. We lived in a very bad neighborhood, the kind your parents warn you about, in a very conservative area, so being openly gay was a huge challenge. Dealing with verbal abuse got through to me very quickly, and within a year, I was diagnosed with depression. It soon turned dark and I decided to commit suicide. I hung the rope, and slipped in. It tugged and tugged. When I lost consciousness, everything went black. I knew I was about to die. I was suddenly faced with extreme regret, anxiety, sadness, happiness, and most of all, fear. Out of the darkness, walked a figure. I was suddenly able to walk around. The figure was an average sized man with a dark grey beard. He asked me if I was ready to go. "Where?" I asked him. "I do not know" he said.  Just then a hand reached out of the darkness and grabbed my arm. Next thing I know, I woke up in ICU.       It's probably just some 13YO Behind a keyboard with a random number generator.      Sphax PureBD craft is a great popular one http://bdcraft.net/   Block update detectors are pretty useful. Its some glitch with the game engine that was discovered a long time ago and was never patched due to its usefulness. its called a block update detector, or BUD switch for short. Its used to detect changes in a block such as stepping on a redstone ore, or opening/closing a door. Its very hard to understand exactly whats going on in the game engine, i just know how it works.    I can probably help.       "When i grow up, I want to be a potato!"  	10
 I think She was implying that Harry was nothing but a father to them. You know, same as if your dad was Tom Brady, Derek Jeter, or Will Ferrell. He's just dad, not an icon.     Why does it matter that Moody turned Malfoy into a ferret once?  Not to be a ballbuster, but Barty Jr.   Good one, my favorite snake.   They won't be remade. Won't! Won't! Won't!   Been at it almost 15 years.    If your girlfriend has a really annoying friend, don't tell her how bothersome she is or to stop being friends with her. Just casually mention how attractive she is.   I think /u/b_w was referring to the fact that Neville just picked up the sorting hat and dusted it off. It was never put on Neville's head and set afire.   Cheers!  Eraserhead blew my mind.   [Here's](https://youtu.be/wOvsmAngDuM) a non-clickbait version.   It's not actually book canon that Draco ever was branded.   Like lollipops to him...   Hmmm... possibly not. Perhaps Fenrir was just paid in gold.   I like to get good and high first, and then have a shower beer after.   Voldemort used Fenrir as someone to do his dirty work, an enforcer, if you will and never gave him the mark.  I would assume it was only for his most trusted/loyal servants.   Rarely dry. In fact, I think it's been about six months since my last drought.      [Here](http://i.imgur.com/P4XzkVX.jpg)   I have his diving watch too.   While Snape has his moments. I would vote for Lupin. He was just a cool guy, and he reminds me of a teacher I had in HS.   It had a busted hinge, so I sent it for repair. Just got it back from PA good as new, except for the spots he wore the chrome off. This lighter has been around the world twice.            The gleam of triumph was because Harry told Albus that Riddle had taken his blood in the graveyard, meaning Harry couldn't die while riddle was alive. I guess that's what you are saying?  Although it was still a suspicion. I think the silver thing just confirmed it.    Makes you wonder if Severus knew why he was keeping his eyes closed.   Remember the silver trinket with the two snakes? "But in essence divided?" That was when Albus knew for certain.   That's what Harry says, but it really comes down to the Elder wand not showing it's allegiance to Voldemort.   Albus did not discover Harry was a horcrux until OotP after Harry saw Arthur being attacked. Not to say he didn't have his suspicions before that though...   I like and appreciate the audiobooks, but I can read them much faster.   That was the one!   Other people have thought, like me, that Dumbledore actually bought the house, and kept Frank on as caretaker. That seems a very Dumbledory thing to do.   After HBP I thought Dumbledore wasn't dead. There were clues, and even a pretty convincing website that had collected every possible theory proving he was still alive.   That's funny.      Yep, exactly this. I has to do with intent. Like Hermione in GOF, she couldn't have freed the Hogwarts' elves even if she tried because she wasn't their master. That's why I think SPEW was a horrible page filler.   Yes, it's rare, but there are muggleborns in Slytherin. Scabior says as much in DH.   I'm not sure that's canon, but seems legit.   interesting...   Right....   why was their vault higher (in Gringott's) than the Black's vault, or vault 713 even?   Right? I think The Donald is just about the biggest troll in history. If he isn't. I will still start the slow-clap.      http://www.funsportsgear.com/products/639151890?s=2 cid=6037522294073 asid=6037522323673 agid=6037522324473      *Will and Won't*   Thanks.   Well TIL, thanks.   I think we're going to the one in Milford.   I love that Colin Hay was included in that scene.   I had not heard that theory before.   Can you elaborate on Slytherin represented by water?    I have that one, campaign trail. I plan on reading it after Hell's Angels.   Edit: I have read F L in Vegas, Rum Diary, and Better Than Sex.   This is why Voldemort used Lucius' wand in the battle of the seven potters. He thought because they shared a common core it was defective.   If you think about it, per an earlier post about the common rooms, The dungeons are cold and not really a place for a snake to be active. I understand how something as large as a basilisk could hibernate in the chamber. It's cold, and snakes sleep when it's cold.  I also understand that the students aren't snakes, but the Ravenclaws were in an aerie(tower), Gryffin(dors) a tower also, Hullfepuffs(badger) were a bit below like a den. Do snakes really sleep that far underground?  **totally unrelated:** I was watching the 1973 Disney version of Robin Hood today, and Friar Tuck is a badger, so was the Fat Friar. When they showed reward posters for Robin Hood, it was paid in **ingotts.**   I don't mean the fuckin shithole either, I'm talking about Trinity's baby.   For sure. He wasn't about to lose his life for journalism no matter how much he hated it. When shit got real he does what most civilians would have done.       Oh, I've never liked horses.   That ass has a tail in front of it.    Pics or it didn't happen.   I think Ron was in love with your butt. ;oP   I know I have depressions in the winter. It's like I'm in a three month funk.    I find his earlier stuff too drawn out and tedious. I'm reading Hell's Angels now. His later writings seem to flow more and have a esy read to them. Rum Diaries, F L, for example.   But it just so happened to be a terrier, which chase otters (Hermione's patronus).   What is LPT?    There are also fireplaces in the classrooms. We see students wearing gloves, scarves, and even balaclavas in the halls during the winter. For me that's how it should be done. It's a 'suck-it-up-and-move-on-with-your-life' type thing.   I've never been, I just assumed that since there are so many English speaking countries, that that's how the films would be.   I believe Albus assumed the Dursleys would explain everything to Harry that he left in his letter, but they didn't do that.   Really?   That's right, my bad.    Yes, they'll all be in European. But you should be able to turn on the English subtitles.  English is the main language in Europe.   It depends on what you offer them. The ministry only offered them broken souls in Azkaban. Voldemort offered them free reign.   I believe OP is referring to the Pottermore stories, and If I'm not mistaken, those can be found in a pdf in a link in the sidebar.   That's what you do on the toilet.   Color me green.            The Boxer shuts up when I tell him too, but the little yapper has no on/off switch. All I can do is pick him up and hold his muzzle. I'm not cruel enough to buy a bark collar. Dogs are supposed to bark.   He barks when someone comes to the door. They only thing I can do is pick him up and hold his mouth shut. I am an actual dog owner, and a damn good one at that.   This is an old Hank Williams song he covered for an anthology. I've seen it live twice.   Yes. The students were already being evacuated, weren't they?      You try chasing a four legged animal about six feet shorter than you are.  I have had dogs all my life thank you very much, and I know how to train them. Roger is a rescue, and a parvo survivor. There isn't shit we can do about his barking.   Cheers.    9/10? Maybe not the defenders of the bars and stripes.      /r/tokespot?      If you read the book, Albus tells harry before he drinks the potion, to use fire. Harry was more than capable to use that spell, but he was panicking, and forgot.   But Harry didn't die because Lily's blood sacrifice was inside Voldemort keeping Harry alive, not because he united the Hallows.    Its just way too long doing nothing.  I think that's what She was trying to convey here, hence all the angst and arguing. Like Harry says something to the effect of, Did you think we would be finding a horcrux every other day? She was trying to show that it wasn't just a cakewalk.   Haha, we live in a house and the neighbors hate him.      Cheers.   Wormtail, desperate to curry favour, salvaged it from the place it had fallen and carried it to him. I admit that would have been a bit of a feat for a rat, but they are highly intelligent creatures!  [Source](http://www.the-leaky-cauldron.org/2007/7/30/j-k-rowling-web-chat-transcript/)      Thank you!   People that perpetuate wrong ideas, such as Harry was a horcrux, therefore the Dursleys were evil people because of it.    also they are considered as intelligent  Crabbe and Goyle?   Harry was not a proper horcrux, as those require an incantation before.      Two more weeks and I will be there. I'm starting to get anxious.   I love to learn. All. The. Damn. Time.   If I'm not reading or investigating something to find out about something I didn't know, I feel the time is wasted.   She said that Wormtail got it from the wreckage that night and kept it safe for Riddle.   Oh, I'm not nearly as clued in as that. I think I need to read the FAQ.    I think I'm good for a while.  *puts the pipe down*          ..ere    Good eye, cheers.         I've had her at 14 for almost two years now.   I don't remember Draco taking the unbreakable vow. Is that indicated in the text?   Someone else mentioned 20 minute flight deck missions. I have a full deck with all level 4 jets, and I just send them once a day or every 24 hours.      I'm going on four years, and I think I've finally got the hang of it. I only have less than half of the heroes, but they are all leveled up.      I think I have found one of the oldest redditors.   Chillin' with the weasel buu.. dy!   Louis CK rocks it.   Scrubs  	123
       Yeah, I mention it at the beginning of my review - he is one of the drivers at the beginning who is responsible for the toxic waste getting loose (which forms the zombeavers).  He's perfect.      And the boobies were tasteful - or at least sufficiently casual that it didn't feel exploitative, right?  This movie just nailed the tone.      I definitely agree with this one - you get to stay in Scotland, plus Liam Neeson to boot!   Yeah, good enough that I don't need to see another second of the film before it is released.  I will avoid the full trailer, previews, all reviews and see the film cold from now on.  edit:  you're really crushing it, Mr. Irritu.         I love Ty Lawson, but this is no longer his team, and his issues on the court have been eclipsed by horrible distractions off the court.  He has been a good player, a good teammate, and a good Nugget - but he is no longer in the right state of mind to be any of those things.  Our organization should reward his past efforts by providing him will all the help he needs off the court, whether that be substance abuse treatment, A.A., or something similar.  In the interim, suspend him indefinitely.   If Ty wasn't locker room poison last year, he will be now.  If other teams come knocking for him, then we'll listen.  If he never shows the F.O. that he wants to be back on the floor as a Nugget, then we waive him when appropriate.  This team no longer belongs to Ty Lawson, and I don't think he really cares about that, either.  Ill Will can tell just from watching a Summer League game that Mudiay is the new face of this team, and I do not want Lawson sulking around feeling shitty about himself and his lot in life and distracting our new leader with his bullshit lifestyle.  Mudiay's head is on straight and I think he plays the game right (and for all the best reasons), so I don't think Lawson's attitude will rub off on him or anything - but I also don't see what Lawson can contribute in his current state.  tl;dr - Lawson has been a good Nugget; he deserves help with the support of the front office, but not to step back in that locker room until he has sorted his life out.  If he doesn't, cut him.    So, a double Kamikazee and a Manhattan?  Seems tasty.   I agree - Iko Uwais is some kind of god who decided to manifest as fists and kicks.         I think more than anything, I worry that BvS will be too focused on establishing a gritty or dark tone to the detriment of everything else.  I think that was one of the issues with Man of Steel.  And, what we saw from Lex Luthor in the trailer bodes well for BvS, because it possibly indicates that the filmmakers are avoiding that same mistake.        I was also a big fan of both trailers, but you're right - I liked SS more.  I like the direction the DCCU is going, and I hope they are successful!   Please relax just a little.  First, you're completely correct - these are both trailers, and I think I do a pretty good job of judging the trailer, not the movie (how could I judge the film - I haven't seen any of it!). I am identifying a potential issue with BvS: DoJ and remarking that SS will likely not face that same issue.  I could be wrong.  Who knows, I am just inferring what I can from the trailer.  Superhero movies don't have to be fun and lighthearted to be great, and I welcome them to explore whatever themes and subjects that the film makers would like.  You mention *V for Vendetta*, which I think was fantastic.  But it wasn't devoid of joy.  *Man of Steel* was.  And if BvS: DoJ follows in its footsteps, it will be weaker for it.  Finally, you can disagree with my opinion all you want - that's fine, and I welcome debate and interesting conversations; it's why I like to talk about movies.  But to charge me of judging these films, when I clearly am judging their trailers, and then throw out a dismissive "This is why I hate critics" is an unfair reading of the situation.  Thanks for the comment, and I hope you will start more arguments with me on other entries on the blog!       My wife said it was pretty crazy, but I sleep like a drunk log baby, so I missed it.   I can definitely come with you on *Death Wish*, as you could almost say that it birthed this specific "pedestrian vigilante"genre.  The classics definitely embrace this, but recently it is much more often that a professional, or at least someone *with skill* goes on the revenge plot.  You even take something like The Brave One with Jodi Foster as an example.  True, she is an everywoman - but she is also pretty good at her revenge plot.  The character in *Blue Ruin* is almost define by his struggles and ineptitude (even though he tries really, really hard).     I really liked this movie, and posted a review on my blog [Plot and Theme] (https://plotandtheme.wordpress.com/2015/06/16/blue-ruin-is-a-brilliant-grounded-deconstruction-of-the-standard-revenge-thriller/).  The opening paragraph is reproduced here to give you a basic idea:  The revenge genre has experienced a small renaissance of late with films like Taken and John Wick portraying purposeful and expert killers running roughshod through those who have wronged them in some way. The audience is generally encouraged to recognize the protagonists ability, and celebrate his or her violence. The low-budget film Blue Ruin, from director Jeremy Saulnier, turns this dynamic on its head by providing us with an everyman thrust into a revenge situation. The resulting story arc follows familiar beats, but the unique perspective infuses this stark film with a beauty and realism that is rarely approached in this exploitative genre.   Fucking Matt Cooke . . .   YouTube has the retrospectives on our two cup seasons.  I think they are called "Landslide" and "Mission Accomplished".  This will teach you our general history and also showcase our greatest moments.  You will be familiar with the greatest moment in Avalanche history, as it included a famous Bruin at the center of it.  There's also great highlight reels of our current boys like MacKinnon, Duchene, and Landeskog.    Finally, it is important to learn about Todd Bertuzzi and Matt Cooke, and also just Google "Avalanche Red Wings Rivalry".  These things are all in the past, but they are still formative.  Other than that, just familiarize yourself with our current roster, and pay attention when the season revs up.   And now, if you'll follow me to my office, where I just have to get off my few for a few minutes . . .  Oh yeah, I'm not gettin' up soon.   You can argue simply from consensus:  T3 hovers around 70% on RottenTomato and TS is at about 33%.  Obviously, RT is not the be-all, end-all for the quality of a film, and you're free to appreciate TS over T3, but as an aggregator of critical praise it gives you a reasonable ballpark at the very least.  And that ballpark says that for every 1 person that liked TS, 2 didn't, whereas it is the exact opposite for T3.  That is surprising to me, as I would have placed T3 somewhere in the low 50s.  Also of note, and of relevance to OP:  TG is currently struggling in the high 20's at RT, so you can certainly argue that it is the worst received of the franchise at the moment.      RIP Duck.   This particular twitter barrage was also written up in the LA Times (I guess [this] (http://www.latimes.com/sports/sportsnow/la-sp-sn-andre-iguodala-foot-locker-20150625-htmlstory.html) counts as reporting these days).  I love how at the end they say that they have reached out to Foot Locker for comment.  Wouldn't it be great if Foot Locker's PR guy released an official statement:  "Who gives a fuck what Andre Iguodala thinks?"   **Plot and Theme**  [A Wordless Tribute to James Horner] (https://plotandtheme.wordpress.com/2015/06/24/a-musical-tribute-to-james-horner/)  The fantastic composer James Horner was killed earlier this week in a one-person aircraft crash.  This post is a departure from my normally wordy pieces, and seeks to honor this great man through only samples of his music.   Ta-ra-ra-Mudiay, did you get yours today?  I got mine yesterday.  That's why I walk this way.   Too bad they didn't trust this offense to get a first down in the NFC championship game when it really mattered.   Sometimes when it is a true story and she feels like the movie isn't explaining something enough, she takes it upon herself to learn more.   Thanks a bunch!  I usually don't like reading reviews before a highly-anticipated movie either, as I always like to be as spoiler-free as possible.  That being said, I do endeavor to keep my "first watch" reviews as spoiler-free as possible.  Obviously I introduce the characters and the basic structure of the plot, but I try not to reveal any twists or much beyond the end of first acts whenever possible.  Thanks for the thumbs-up, and be sure to visit back after you see the flick!   Do not look up the true story, google any characters, or anything like that if you don't know what happens and want to stay spoiler-free.  My wife googled a character's name *during the movie* and promptly flipped out.   **Plot and Theme**  [Pixars Inside Out Beautifully Depicts the Emotion and Struggle of Growing Up] (https://plotandtheme.wordpress.com/2015/06/17/pixars-inside-out-beautifully-depicts-the-emotion-and-struggle-of-growing-up/)  This post is a recent review that I have done for Pixar's *Inside Out*, and I feel like it was one of my better movie reviews (not only because it was the best film that I saw so far, but also because of good writing).  **Plot and Theme** does movie news, movie reviews, and essays, and seeks to analyze them from an aesthetic perspective.  Enjoy and please share if you like it (and comment to tell me what I am doing wrong, also).      That's okay - eventually you will get to see it and then Joy will take over for Sadness!      He grades *Inside Out* at C+, so if your theory is correct, then this particular critic has a slightly better estimation of the film than his creative writing teacher had of him.    My life is not complete if a single person grades Inside Out at C+.  /s   He isn't *entirely* contrarian, though.  He agrees with the tomatometer 75% of the time.  He reviews so many films, though, that you can easily point to times where he has disagreed massively.  I don't know if he purposefully wanted to pan Inside Out because everyone else loved it, but he did end up on a C+ for his grade (which, in my book, is above 75%, so rottentomatoes should consider it a positive review).  I consider the film a masterpiece (i've posted my own review recently in /r/movies), and I think he missed the forest for the trees in his evaluation, but that's his loss.   This is a particularly reductive evaluation.   Yeah, I am not seeing it yet, either.  Might be a little slow on the uptake, or it isn't available at the theater we want.     I was trolling through the movie news this morning for my blog and came across this awesome story.  I already wanted to see *Dope*, and now I guarantee that I will go and see it in theaters - and pay with bitcoin!  Hopefully, if this goes smoothly, it will result in movietickets.com adding permanent bitcoin support!      This is the greatest romantic comedy of all time, and it isn't particularly close.  Jack Lemmon is amazing, and when you consider the context of the time, the subject matter is pretty risque.    Highland Park 12 for single, Johnny Black for blend.  Highland is right down the middle with smoke/peat/sherry/medicinal.  It will give you a baseline to explore from.  JB is low level blend, but should give you an idea (skip red, actual liquid garbage)   Spread the hype!  https://plotandtheme.wordpress.com/2015/06/04/no-man-born-of-woman-shall-miss-the-macbeth-teaser-trailer/   I watched *Shame* first, and now am bee-lining for *12 Years a Slave*.  McQueen + Fassbender 4 Life!   Don't know that one, will give it a look.  Thanks!   P.o.V. shift is actually incredibly prominent, and I didn't appreciate it so much until you mentioned it.  We start on the guard (and sometimes return to him), we see the first prisoner, we see Bobby Sands, we see the guard you mentioned who cries.  Very cool point, and I'll think on this some more.    Very interesting course matter - do you recall any other films you got to watch for this?  *Sunday Bloody Sunday*?  *In the Name of the Father*?  The religious symbolism has me interested.  Maybe if I muster up the desire to watch Hunger again, I'll keep my eyes peeled for some more.   In the following blog post I review and discuss Steve McQueen's first feature [*Hunger*] (https://plotandtheme.wordpress.com/2015/05/27/mcqueen-dissapears-fassbender-in-hunger/).  But, I would love to discuss specific aspects of the film that are not appropriate for a straight-up review, as well.  First, I was absolutely amazed by McQueen's ability to introduce us to this world with very little dialogue.  The brutality is foreshadowed when we see the first prison guard rinsing his scabbed-over knuckles in the sink, and the dreadful tone is established simply by having him inspect his car for bombs as his wife looks on, worried.  This type of world-building continues in the prison, and is simply masterful.  I had known little about these events before watching the film, but it did most of the work for me!  Second, I'd love to talk about the strangeness of the point of view of the film.  Do you think that his film actively takes the side of the Provisional IRA in a political sense - or is it merely revealing the horrors perpetrated by a government over-wrought with power?  I get the feeling that the theme of the film focuses less on political matters per se (so, it isn't about a unified Ireland, or even religious freedom or anything) and more focused on integrity and the treatment of ideological adversaries during war times.  There's also clear themes of propaganda, white-washing, and political statements.    Finally, I can't get over the climax of the film, which in my opinion begins with Bobby Sands and his priest friend talking, continues for a 17-minute long shot with no cuts or camera movement, and concludes when we get a single cut to Sands getting a new cigarette as he prepares for another 5+ minute long soliloquy detailing his justification for the hunger strike.  I name this the climax of the film because, from this point, all of the drama is merely resolution of the thematic elements introduced here. Haunting and beautiful.   If you haven't seen this movie, you should really give it a shot, despite how unflinching and brutal it can be.  I simply can't get over it.   Got my hat and shirt on; tryin' for some mojo.   I would wait in line for the right to embarrass myself in front of lifelong friends and work colleagues.   I actually wrote about that scene in an earlier draft of the piece, but swapped it out for the diner scene.  It is hilarious, which was the main point of including it, but I ended up enjoying the linguistic isolation that Emmanuelle experiences more than another demonstration of Landa as a master.   That sounds interesting at the very least.  Enjoy Ex Machina!   Completely understandable, and I really don't hold that against them. But I'd like to generate some traffic from people who enjoy movies and like reading about them, so I do my very best to be as appropriate as possible.  Hopefully I come off as sincere and not click-baity, but that is for others to decide.   I have a post on my movie blog, **Plot and Theme** where I discuss this movie at length:  [Spoken Language as a Stylistic Choice in Quentin Tarantinos Inglorious Basterds] (https://plotandtheme.wordpress.com/2015/04/24/spoken-language-as-a-stylistic-choice-in-quentin-tarantinos-inglorious-basterds/).  I look at three great scenes where different spoken languages play pivotal roles in generating tension, humor, and plot development:  the opening farm scene, the diner scene, and the bar scene.  Suffice to say, I really love this film, and it's great that is has been added to Netflix, even if only in a few regions.   That movie looks so weird to me.  I don't quite know how I feel about it.  What was your overall opinion of it?   After seeing *Ex Machina*, I was incredibly impressed by Alicia Vikander, so I looked more into her career and posted the results at my blog Plot and Theme, [here](https://plotandtheme.wordpress.com/2015/05/12/alicia-vikander-is-exploding-and-thats-a-great-thing/).  In that post, I detail some important roles that Vikander has played in the past, and make the argument that she is soon to become a household name due to her future films.  If you're not aware, Vikander has a large number of high-quality films to be released in the near future, and I was surprised at how many of these films I found very interesting.  She is not only working with some talented directors (Guy Ritchie, Tom Hooper, and Derek Cianfrance, to name a few), but a host of A-list actors as well, including Eddie Redmayne, Michael Fassbender, and Tom Hanks.  So, what you you think?  Did you enjoy Alicia Vikander's performance as Ava, or think that it was nothing special?  What about her future films: are there any that have you particularly interested?  I think *The Danish Girl* could be very good, but it has an Oscar Bait kind of feel to it which has me a little reticent.    Yeah, it makes it kind of difficult because it isn't terribly consistent.   IMDB has six films listed as being released in 2015:  five that I mentioned (not The Circle, which is in pre-production) and *Ex Machina*.  But, movies like *Son of a Gun*, *Seventh Son*, and *Testament of Youth*, which she had roles in are listed under 2014, even though some were released in 2015 in some markets.  So, if you include those three with the six I mentioned, you'd get to nine.  Maybe that's the maths behind that number.   On the contrary, I think *Ex Machina* makes a profoundly feminist statement.  Ava begins the movie as an object in the eyes of the two men in her life.  As the drama unfolds, she expresses her own individual desires and goals, ultimately shaking off her patriarchal captor and knight in shining armor in favor of her own realized personhood.  I have a post at my blog [here] ( https://plotandtheme.wordpress.com/2015/04/30/ex-machina-portrays-a-unique-exploration-of-feminine-independence/) where I review the film with this precise question in mind.     I definitely get a bit of an Oscar bait vibe from *The Danish Girl*, too.  It is released in that perfect window to generate buzz.       I was incredibly impressed by the performance that Alicia Vikander gave in Alex Garland's *Ex Machina*, so I wanted to look more into her career for my movie blog, Plot and Theme.  The results can be found [here] (https://plotandtheme.wordpress.com/2015/05/12/alicia-vikander-is-exploding-and-thats-a-great-thing/), but suffice to say that I am very excited about these films.  Up next for Vikander is *The Man from U.N.C.L.E*, an adaptation of a british TV spy show from the 70s. Directed by Guy Ritchie, Alicia co-stars with Henry Cavill (*Man of Steel*) and Armie Hammer (*The Social Network*).  Then the European period piece with Christoph Waltz in *Tulip Fever* as the subject of an artists painting during the Dutch Tulip craze.  Late this year, Vikander is set to star beside Oscar winner Eddie Redmayne in *The Danish Girl*. This film, directed by Tom Hooper (*Les Miserables, The Kings Speech*), tells the true story of Einar Wegener / Lili Elbe, a Danish artist who transitioned from male to female in 1930s Europe. Shell also star with Bradley Cooper and Jamie Dornan in the comedy *Adam Jones*, about a chef who assembles a crew to create the best restaurant ever. Continuing this run, Alicia joins Michael Fassbender and Rachel Weisz in *The Light between Oceans*, a story about an Australian couple who raise a baby rescued from an adrift rowboat (hopefully more cheery than director Derek Clanfrances *Blue Valentine*). Oh, and if that was not enough, it was announced this week that Vikander signed on to star with Tom Hanks in *The Circle*.  It is hard for me to even choose which of these I am most excited for, but it would probably be the recently announced *The Circle* with Tom Hanks.  I have always been a sucker for a good techno-thriller.  Although co-starring with Eddie Redmayne in *The Danish Girl* could be something special as well. What about you - were any of these films on your radar?  If not, are you excited about any of them now?      For those cinephiles out there unaware of some of the great offerings our little capital city has, I have published a short review of Duck Soup Cinema:  *The General* at my blog Plot and Theme.  You can find the particular post [here] (https://plotandtheme.wordpress.com/2015/05/08/duck-soup-cinema-and-the-general/).    Duck Soup cinema endeavors to show old silent movies with live musical accompaniment, with original film stock and projection.  The shows often begin with live, vaudevillian-style acts, but I haven't mentioned that in the blog post (it tries to focus on movies and movie news).  It was absolutely one of the most fun experiences I have ever had at the movies, and I am looking forward to future shows, which can be perused at [The Duck Soup Cinema page] (http://www.overturecenter.org/programs/duck-soup-cinema) at the Overture Center website.  And yes, tickets are only $7, which is likely cheaper than most movies you'll see in modern theatres.   Lots of people here are saying "cash", but I think it is clear that you'd prefer something else.  You're asking about a payment methods that is safe, secure, and can't be faked, while at the same time not exposing you or the buyer to holding large sums of cash.  You want bitcoin.  I know, I know - bare with me.  If the buyer wants your car, they can set up an account at a place like circle.com or coinbase, or a number of others.  They will be able to buy bitcoin with their bank account, transfer the bitcoin to a wallet (on their phone, for example), and then come to meet you.  They can inspect the car, and if you agree to the sell, he will transfer the bitcoin to your wallet (again, on your phone, or computer, or whatever; I recommend the Mycelium Wallet).  The transaction will show up almost instantly, and you'll be able to see the bitcoin leaving his address and going to yours, but there won't be any confirmations.  Wait for six confirmations (about an hour) and you can be almost certain that the money will not be double-spent, and it is yours.  Then, sign over the title to the buyer, and you are done.  If someone were to try to take your phone (to get at the bitcoin), simple passwords and 2FA will keep them from spending it until you recover your wallet.  You can keep your new bitcoin or deposit it into an exchange to turn it back into your local currency, whichever you prefer.  The biggest difficulty would be getting your buyer to buy all that bitcoin.  But, if you're willing to learn how to use it, it will most certainly be the most secure and safe way to transact.  Best of all - you can do it at any hour of the day (no need for an open bank!)   You can just say, "more":  "Alcohol kills 10,000 more people than marijuana each year."  Obviously, any listener would immediately want more information, so you can give them one of the values, and the relationship would be known completely.        It is certainly true that Tarantino builds and releases the tension in the opening scene in a variety of ways; I am sure that one could write an entire piece on just that idea and find it very fruitful.  There's the claustrophobia that you mention, the movement of the camera and the closeups on two outstanding actors, but that is only the beginning.  The scene seems to breathe with tension as it alternates between interrogation, comic exaggeration (Landa's pipe), and horror.  I would agree with you that this is Tarantino with his full powers realized.  But where I think this scene truly shines is in teaching the audience everything they need to know to understand how the rest of the movie is going to work.  It shows us how spoken language will be important; how comedy, tension, and gore will interact, and introduces us to the titanic character of Landa, who drives the plot as much as anyone.  It truly is a great opening scene.    In my newly-launched movie blog, *Plot and Theme* I have recently posted [this essay] (https://plotandtheme.wordpress.com/2015/04/24/spoken-language-as-a-stylistic-choice-in-quentin-tarantinos-inglorious-basterds/) on Quentin Tarantino's *Inglorious Basterds*, wherein I analyze three scenes in which the language(s) spoken by the characters greatly enhances the drama, comedy, and tension in the scene.  I have chosen the three scenes:  the opening scene with Colonel Hans Landa, the diner scene with Shosanna (now named Emmanuelle) and the underground bar scene which kicks of Operation Keno.  In the essay, I discuss the importance of Tarantino's decision to use communication and language as a specific stylistic choice, instead of defaulting to all-English for the sake of the audience.  Most of the readers of my nascent blog are friends who are more interested in my reviews of more recent movies, and so they are not as interested in these more-developed pieces as I imagine a community like /r/TrueFilm would be.  As such, I have provided a link and brief description of the post, as well as its full title in hopes of sparking more discussion on what I consider to be a critical choice which makes *Inglorious Basterds* a seminal movie in Tarantino's filmography - and perhaps his masterpiece.  How do you respond to the manipulation of spoken language in this film?  Can you think of other scenes where this happens in this, or other movies?   Yeah, that's tough to find, especially because more recent movies benefit from higher ticket prices.  If, however, you adjust for inflation, you get [this list] (http://www.boxofficemojo.com/alltime/adjusted.htm).  There's a bunch of reasonable answers there, with *Dr. Zhivago* probably being the highest-grossing film meeting your description.   It is a little rough nailing down exactly what it meant by "critically acclaimed" (not your fault - there's just different metrics from person to person), but you can make a little headway.  If you look at the highest grossing box office returns of all time, there are some standouts.  *Frozen* sits at #5 all-time, and was very well received by the critics, and there are some other very good animated films that have a similar standing (see:  *Toy Story 3* at #14 and *The Lion King* at #21).  The best films in blockbuster trilogies tend to be well-represented, too:  *The Return of the King* is at #9 and won 11 Oscars and both *The Dark Knight* and *The Dark Knight Rises* sit in the top 20.  The best answers that are not animated or comic book / fantasy franchises are things like Inception (#43), *E.T.* (#48), and *Forest Gump* (#76 ).  All of these films made over 2/3 of a billion dollars, but once you go around 500 million you start to see things like *Saving Private Ryan*, *American Sniper*, and a bunch more.   I love character actor Brad Pitt much more than I love lead actor Brad Pitt.   Oh.  That's much worse.   I took all the stickers of of my brand-new fitted Colorado Rockies hat on Monday, and wore it to work, all day.  I have worn it every day since.  I work in Madison, Wisconsin.  I am not saying that my new hat is magical and affects the outcome of ALL Rockies games - just those that are played in the same state.     Yeah, that's the idea.  Personally, I have no idea what Homer means.   This is a huge bag of worms, you know.   It's a knave girl!   Hydrological, *and* hydrodynamical?  Talk about running the gamut . . .   I don't know if I have ever seen something quite as funny as George C. Scott acting out the Bomber for the president, getting super excited, only to realize that its success means Doomsday.  Unless it is the president's one-sided phone call with the Russian president.  Oh, or "Mineshaft Gap".    /u/All_Seven_Samurai is pretty spot-on here:  A Clockwork Orange's reputation makes it seem like it is going to be fantastically uncomfortable to watch, almost as if it is some kind of taboo, but this just isn't the case, for a few reasons.  First, violence in movies (both sexual and physical) has come a long way since 1971.  I don't want to downplay the horrific acts that occur in *A Clockwork Orange*, because they are integral to the story, but suffice to say that you *probably* are building them up in your imagination.  Second, the violence is very stylized and almost comical in some senses (which I think is where /u/All_Seven_Samurai's characterization of it as "tasteful" comes from).  The bottom line is, whenever there is violence on the screen in this movie, you are absolutely certain that it serves some artistic purpose - that it is not violence for its own sake (or for pure shock value).  That, in my mind, lends great credibility to scenes that otherwise might be questionable.  And finally, the violence actually plays an incredibly important role *in the plot of the movie* (in more ways that one, actually).  Hence, you can be rest assured that even if you watch it and feel upset because you don't like the violence - then Kubrick has you right where he wants you, which will likely give the film more punch.  Happy viewing!  PS:  *2001* is life-changing.  Keep it on the DVR; one watch is not even close to enough. And *Barry Lyndon* was the last Kubrick film that I watched, and is quickly climbing the ranks in my estimation.   I mean, it is *possible*, but if you look into the production of *The Shining* and see the architectural blueprints that Kubrick had and couple that with how he was such a perfectionist I am much more comfortable leaning towards all of this being deliberate.  Plus there are a great number of examples of this kind of thing.   If you watch the scene just before this one, you see Jack walk through the Overlook hotel and look around.  As he walks into the office, it is clear that it is completely contained within the Overlook (so there is no wall of the office that could possibly be in common with the outer wall of the Overlook).  Hence, this window shouldn't exist.  This is just one example of a number of architectural anomalies the Kubrick shows us in the Overlook hotel.  You can find more if you pay close attention to when Danny is biking around and such.  [Source] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sUIxXCCFWw)  (Hop to 1:07 for the window discussion, but the whole video is worth watching).    This movie is so unnerving, largely due to Kubrick being a master manipulator of his viewers.  An example:  that window behind the boss shouldn't even be there.   This is all correct, and I in no way wanted to point to this study as a faithful representation of either Nigerians, black women, or any one single group other than women with HSV-2 who took the questionnaire.  That is clearly, as you have pointed out, absurd on its very face.  But, having their questionnaire plus actual serological data gives the researchers the ability to correlate certain activities of the women in the study with their HSV-2 seropositivity.  Obviously, correlation does not equal causation, but these correlations let the authors state a conclusion like, "The women who participated in sexual activity at a younger age were more likely to be seropositive" or, "The women with more sexual partners were more likely to be seropositive" and so on.  And, as I suggested, it is wrong to immediately assume that these correlations would prove true all over the world (due to myriad factors), but they do provide possible explanations that could be tested with further studies or by data-mining previous ones.  Essentially, this study provides data which can be helpful for informing new studies or directions to look - not because the woman were Nigerian or black or anything like that, but because they correlate HSV-2 seroprevalence to specific behavior.   An interesting observation, but it is worthwhile to realize that in most academic journals, the authors' names are posted as:  Last name Initial Initial.   As with most questions in science, the answer is both:  1.)  Complicated and 2.) Not completely understood, but I can point you to some possible explanations.  Late last year, [Kalu EI et al](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25116666). published a study of Nigerian pregnant women dealing with the sero-prevalence of HSV-2.  Interestingly, they found a prevalence very similar to the study which is linked by OP: 47.3% of pregnant women given the survey and tested had HSV-2.  The possible explanations  that they derived based on their questionnaire were:  "early exposure to sexual intercourse, number of sex partners, involvement in polygamous marriages, involvement of husband in extra-marital affairs and hormonal contraceptive use."  And, while it would be wrong to assume that what is true in Nigeria is 100% applicable to what is true in the USA with regards to this question, I think as long as the science is rigorous, we can learn from it.  Obviously, this study did not attempt to answer the question with regards to race or socio-economic status, but it does give us some directions to look (for example, do black women engage in sexual intercourse at younger ages than other racial groups, on average?  Do they generally have more sex partners?  Etc, etc.)     That's not what I meant . . .   As long as your mom doesn't smother you, I think you'll be okay.   I have an eerily similar, equally-crushing story.  Last year for Christmas, my new wife (we got married on the 20th) spent some time with my mom and her parents.  Also in attendance were children and grandchildren from this grandpa's first marriage.  The Christmas dinner included two full Prime Ribs, which were to be prepared in a rotating slow-cooker.  We were very, very pleased.  As you have guessed, my non-biological grandpa and his family were in charge of the Prime Ribs, and they like their meat well-done.  Hence, when it came time to serve the Prime Rib, and I was looking for some correctly cooked slices, there were none to be found.  Now, I am not some kind of unappreciative asshole - you buy the meat then you get to cook it however you want, even if I think it is abominably incorrect.  But, why would you need to do that with a Prime Rib Roast?  The losers can eat the ends and outsides and we professional meat-eaters can have the middle, red, delicious parts.  But nope, solid grey throughout *both* roasts.  Boo.   Me neither; they (the players) really haven't earned the benefit of the doubt in my opinion.  Still, I think presenting their defense to the redditors less-familiar with the story is worthwhile.   Reposting this from the other thread about Shaw:  It is worth pointing out that the defense given by the players was that it has been "six weeks" since the team won a game at home, and that they were disgusted by that fact and using it as a rallying cry. This makes some sense, as the team last won at home on Jan 14th, against the Mavericks. But, the end of the season is six weeks from tomorrow, so it was about six-and-a-half weeks from both events when the chant happened.  And that kind of unfortunate coincidence completely describes exactly how the Nuggets' season is going.

But, the end of the season is six weeks from tomorrow, so it was about six-and-a-half weeks from both events when the chant happened.    And that kind of unfortunate coincidence completely describes exactly how the Nuggets' season is going.   Fuck.  The first thing I said after seeing this was, "That was sick!"  The second one was, "He probably missed the free-throw."  And then the video cuts out just before he shoots it.     That would be great, but we're tanking fairly well now as-is.  We'd effectively have both our ping-pongs and theirs for the upcoming lotto (which, atm, would give us almost a 1-in-3 shot at #1 overall, and a top 3 pick about 4/5ths of the time).  That is pretty sweet.  But, I think the dream scenario is to tank all the way to #4 or #5 (#4 requires the Lakers to gain 3.5 games on us; not impossible with 20+ to go), and snatch a top 3 this year.  Then, next year, have the Knicks suck again and grab another top 3 while we compete for a playoff spot.  Two years running with top 3 picks is almost what the Magic did in the early 90's (when they got back-to-back ones in Shaq and Webber), and is definitely the best shot we have at building a strong team (coupling new superstars with the strong role players that we have now, both from foreign finds like Nurkic and Lauvergne and established talent like Lawson and Gallo).   Cool, thanks!  Also, Hopefully the Knicks suck for one more year!   I agree with you regarding D'antoni/Karl.  While there is likely at least some merit to taking advantage of the altitude with a high-octane offense (D'antoni's signature strength going back to the Nash-led Suns, and a tradition here in Denver going from Karl all the way back to Doug Moe), I think that approach is fundamentally flawed.  And that flaw comes with the way the NBA playoffs are structured.  During the regular season, the Nuggets get teams coming into town on the second night of back-to-backs, or even a 4th game in 5 nights.  Those teams are certainly at a disadvantage.  Even teams coming in on a normal road trip can have an issue, as there is less time to devote to defending this high-speed offense.  But, in the playoffs, that all goes out the window.   Generally, you get the 2-2-1-1-1 structure (I am aware that the finals are different - but the Nuggets have never gotten that far, so who cares?).  In this structure, there is at least one day between games, and sometimes two or even three!  Hence, you get rested, well-coached teams which have time to prepare for this specific, unique, fast-paced offense.  This traditionally results in the Nuggets losing badly in the playoffs, even when they are favorites.  So, I agree - the Nuggets need to move in a more strategically sound direction.  You can still take advantage of the altitude during the regular season, but do it not by running up and down the court, but through sound ball movement and a punishing defense which forces an offense to work for every shot attempt.  Then, in the event that the team finds its way back to the playoffs, that kind of non-gimicky gameplan can travel well and compete with a well-coached team.   Especially if we only have to ship one of the protected first that we have (I think we have a Cleveland one and a Nicks one left?  Hard to remember where everything came from).  Point is - we may have the bargaining chips to send a 1st for Thibs without impacting the future, and it'd be great to have him, as you said.   Yeah, exactly - something where keeping Shaw around was permanent damage to the team (in your example, by making the players feel like management didn't support them - likely leading to players wanting to book it for greener pastures).   I am in agreement - Brooks often looks horribly outcoached in playoff series, only to be bailed out by his supremely talented players.  I shudder to think what will happen if he is forced to go from Durant/Westbrook/Ibaka to Gallo/Lawson/Faried (I love 'em, but seriously).   This is very interesting.  Now, I know that man people who frequent this sub were tired of Shaw, and wanted him out, so I can understand the elation that I am seeing everywhere, but I'd like to draw attention to how strange this is (in my opinion at least).  It is pretty clear that this team in in tanking mode.  If they end up with more than 25 wins this year, it will be a mistake (fortunately, we are well on track for the #5 slot in the lottery, which gives us a good puncher's chance at top 3 (almost 30%, with 9% chance at #1 overall).  That being said - why not just let Shaw carry out the rest of the year?  What is to be gained from having an interim coach for the last month and a half?  The only conclusion that I can come to is that the front office thinks that the longer Shaw stays around, the more damage he does to the players we have.  They want him out ASAP so that he doesn't frustrate Lawson (for example), or so that he doesn't keep wasting opportunities to get rookies minutes, or so he doesn't poison the culture beyond repair.  Anyway, it just strikes me as a horribly negative view on Shaw as a locker-room presence.  It may be justified, but that doesn't make it any less surprising for me.   I deadpan this every time I don't understand who the TV is referring to.  My wife is getting *really* tired of it.    DOZENS!  [At the Freaker's Ball] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hs5MAWinxqQ) is absolutely unreal.   [By the way . . .] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHCs3v_mFkM)   "Goons."  "Who?"  "Hired Goons."  "Hired Goons?"   "Do it for her!"   I have.  I was watching the second Hobbit movie, however, so it really wasn't all that unexpected.   One of my absolute favorite jokes from anything, ever.   "Yes!!! He's really showing us what a man with a cannon in his chest can do!"  is my notification alert on my phone.  It makes each day slightly less horrible to live through.   Also, Bender has an odd obsession with the concept of "irony", there's a great circuitous "Gift of the Magi"-esque plan, and while there are a lot of subtle jokes, there are also many great jokes which basically just involve a character explaining how they feel (which makes me feel angry).  Also:  by "Devil", I mean, "Robot Devil" and by, "Metaphorically" I mean, "Get your coat".  	113

It happened to a number of the other sub/r's I've modded at the same time.                  x-post: /r/EnergyStorage            [Boeing Patents Laser Nuclear Fusion Jet Engine](http://spectrum.ieee.org/tech-talk/energy/nuclear/boeing-patents-laser-nuclear-fusion-jet-engine/?utm_source=energywise utm_medium=email utm_campaign=071515)                  [Tiny working 3D human hearts grown from nothing  and other organs could be coming](http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/tiny-working-3d-human-hearts-made-from-nothing--and-other-organs-could-be-coming-10390855.html)         [Gating a single-molecule transistor with individual atoms](http://www.nature.com/nphys/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nphys3385.html)                                                                        Ejectable cores surrounded in blackbox material with parachutes                                                                                                                                       until that moment, I've never done anything with bitcoin but read about it.  normally I'd never accept it, but... curiosity (and ease) compelled me to try it out.  thanks! :)     	199
       Republic Wireless can run off your WiFi. Not great for out on the road, but at least you can get calls at home.   How about the period from the end of WWII to the beginning of the Korean War, say 1946-1950?  I could see that being an interesting show. Kind of The Best Years Of Our Lives: The Series.   I love this show. Jack Black and Aasif Mandvi have great chemistry as a comedy duo and Robbins has been killing it as the Clintonesque, oversexed, wheeler dealer, Secretary of State.    Sign up with an MVNO that uses the AT T network.   http://bestmvno.com/att-mvnos.html   Check the username.   So, the lessons here are as follows.   1) No matter how beloved your franchise is, if you make a bad movie, people aren't going to line up around the block to see it.  2) Just because your movie makes an unexpected load of cash, that doesn't mean it rates a sequel.   It still made a very nice return for its small budget.       If anyone is interested, a misheard or misinterpreted lyric is called a mondegreen.   For some reason, these always make me laugh and so I'm sitting here at work, quietly chuckling to myself as I read though the linked thread.      Either [Harry Tracy: Desperado](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0084052/) or [Radioactive Dreams](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0091818/)        The show was so slow that at times it seemed to be almost plotless. I half think that Simon made it as an experiment to see if he could put out a show where almost nothing happens and see if anyone would watch it.   I loved the show. I loved the characters. I loved the music. I was tremendously sad when it was cancelled.   But I don't think I ever said, "I wonder what happens on Treme tonight" because I really didn't care what happened. I just wanted to pop open a beer and spend an hour with Antoine Batiste, Albert Lambreaux and the rest of the gang.   I lot of people have problems with a show like that, so they didn't watch it.        Hey, you're the one who made the incorrect statements about "here in the USA" and what the minimum wage is. I just corrected you.   HTH HAND   Federal minimum wage is $7.25/hour. Some states are higher.   That's the law. You can't  make deductions for things that benefit the employer, which include uniforms, tools, register shortages and such like if such deductions would reduce the employees pay rate below minimum wage.  http://www.wagehourinsights.com/minimum-wage/collecting-debts-from-employees/  If a minimum wage employee screws up, you're free to fire them, but you have to cover those losses out of your own pocket.     That's not true. It is absolutely illegal for any employer in the US to make deductions from your pay that would reduce your rate below minimum wage.    Some states have stronger protections for wage deductions.   Nope, never again.   Think about the MASH finale. 125 million people watched that show. over 60% of all households in the US were tuned in. If there was an apotheosis for the mass media, that was it.    Remember, that was in the days of three broadcast networks and very little else of note. Cable was in its infancy. The VCR was just starting to catch on. If you weren't watching one of the big three, you were probably watching old movies or re-runs.  The only thing that compares to that now is the Superbowl.     The viewing landscape becomes more    After Hours (1985)      I remember Lacey when she was on Party Of Five. I thought she might be the breakout star from that show. Oh wel.   I'm sure their money spends just as well as money from a more prestigious projects and I'd be willing to be this was a pretty quick shoot.  I love Tobo, but I'm sure he's not in a position to turn down a lot of work.   Morgan Fairchild, what the hell did you do to your face?               JSTOR had no interest in prosecution, but it is believed that some person or persons in the MIT administration wanted Swartz to spend at least few months behind bars for the trouble he caused and communicated this to the US Attorney's office.  Obviously, in the aftermath of Swartz's suicide, there aren't a lot of people stepping forth to claim responsibility.      That was fun. Thanks!      They've been talking about it for over a year now. It's a pretty serious proposal and doesn't require approval by congress, so I expect some version of it, maybe not the full salary bump, will go into effect some time before the end of Obama's term.   I expect that a lot of organizations like yours, that rely on abusing low-paid, exempt employees, will have serious issues when it goes into effect.  Hours are hours, even if the task load isn't onerous. In my job, there's often time not a lot of work to actually do, but I have to be there and be attentive to the situation. Stretches without significant off time can be very wearing.  Can you push back on the events some? Either that or just start giving everyone, including yourself, days off mid-week?   Also, if you're working so hard that you're sleeping on the office couch you need to stop that shit right now. You will seriously damage yourself and that's not going to help anyone.    Sometimes for things to get fixed, you have to let them break. You working yourself and your staff like crazy to keep all the plates balanced is justr putting a band-aid on things. Maybe you need to call in sick for a few days and let things take their natural course.  Good luck!    This is funny, but it reminds me of when I used to do comedy improv. There's a common bit where you're doing a scene and at random points you "forget" what you were going to say next and the audience is supposed to shout out a word to fill in the blank and you say that word and continue on based on it.  Nine times out of ten the audience would shout out "penis".   Can you bring your concerns to the board? Speak with each of them individually and express your concern?  From the sound of it, things will probably fly apart there once the new FLSA rules for exempt employees go into effect. All of the low level exempt employees who have been worked hard to keep things running will have to be either bumped up to the new exempt minimum ($970/wk) or be paid hourly.  In the meantime, you need to establish boundaries. You can't work yourself sick because there's not enough staffing. Work a reasonable amount and then go home. If things don't get done or fall by the wayside, so be it. As important as the work you're doing might be, it's not as important as your physical or mental health, The same goes for your staff.  There's probably not a good long-term solution here, so I'd think about planning your exit strategy now.   Can we get a bunch of ex-Navy Seals to team up and find this guy for the reward money? 3.8 Million is a lot of scratch.       At least she wasn't flogged or beheaded.    The minimum anyone should consider charging for a job like this is three times your original, hourly W-2 rate.   Even in a situation where you left on good and friendly terms, your contracting rate should involve some pain for your ex-employer, now client because you don't want them to keep calling you. You want to provide every incentive for them to make themselves self-sufficient.    If you don't, if your contracting rate is very reasonable, they will keep calling you...sure as hell.            And if they agree to pay you a consulting fee, make sure you get the money before you start any work.       If the CEO of the company wants to run a company where he provides high-paying jobs to his friend's wives, there's probably not much you can do about it. There's no law against overpaying a useless slacker and underpaying the people who actually do the work.  If you want to, you can start documenting your interactions with Jane. Keep track of the work you've done for her and all the times you've helped her. You might even think about sending your boss e-mails with reports couched as status updates. Something like, "Just FYI: Did my ten TPS reports this week and, as per your instructions, I did the eight assigned to Jane as well".  Will this help? Probably not.   The best thing you can do for yourself is get your resume together and start looking for a new job. Maybe if enough actual workers leave, the company will figure out what's going on.    Could be they're hazing him. Some places like to haze the new guy for a while.  Could also be they're just assholes.  Either way, just tell him to ignore it, don't take it personally and do his work. It will work itself out sooner or later.   It's important to understand that "Hostile Work Environment" is a specific term used in employment law and only applies if the hostility is due to the fact that you belong to a protected class.  There's no law against your boss being an asshole just because.   I work a 12 hour shift. I get off sometime between 8-8:30 AM and I'm usually home by 9:15, depending on traffic. I try to get to bed by 11, sleep six hours and then get ready to be to work by 8 again.   TIL: If I want tons of links from Reddit to my site, all I have to do is put some text in my TOU forbidding such links without express, written permission.  I'll be keeping that one in my pocket for a rainy day.   I seem to remember some similar shit about the F-14 back in the day. I remember reading some article about how when the F-14's tangled with F-4's playing the bad guys in war games, the F-14's got their asses handed to them.  This was many years ago, so I may be fuzzing some of the details.   Essentially what your boss is saying is that he'd like you to give the company a few hours a week of free work and then, after a few months of that, he'll consider giving you more money. Does that sound like a good deal to you?  Also, if you're not an exempt employee, you must be paid for all hours worked. If your lunch is normally unpaid and you work through it, you are legally entitled to be paid for it.   It's a fun film and very re-watchable. My daughter has seen it dozens of times and she wanted to name our dog Bolt.   There will always be people who want to eat actual animal meat, even if the vat-grown meat tastes, looks and smells exactly the same.  So I'm sure there will always be cows, chickens and pigs, albeit fewer of them.    Think of it as a learning experience. Sometimes knowledge and wisdom only come with pain and suffering.  If you get nothing out of this job except figuring out how to stand up for yourself to a shitty boss, it will have been well worth it.   Sometimes it's good to work shitty jobs for a while. There are important things to learn working a crap job.  Two important things:  * Don't ever ever EVER work off the clock. As an hourly employee you must be paid for every minute you work for the company. Unpaid work is theft. Don't let them bully you into working for free.  * Don't do anything that you feel is unsafe. No job is worth getting injured for.  Otherwise, try and figure out when to put your head down and take it and when to stand up for yourself.   Good luck!   It's rare that a contract position like that means that you must work there for the full term of the contract or that they're obligated to actually employ you for that period. Obviously you should carefully read anything they give you to sign and understand it before you sign it.   In the US, a contract position is basically a longer term temp and either party can leave anytime they like.    As the father of a six year-old I can say that I've sat through worse movies.   It's not cringey bad or particularly stupid or annoying. It's a breezy 90 minutes with a bunch of minion business for the kids, a few jokes for the adults and a nice sixties vibe that plays pretty well, all things considered.  It is incredibly lazy. There's really no story or point to anything. Just a lot of running around and silliness and then it ends.  It made me think of some of the interviews Pete Docter gave about Inside/Out. Apparently the early versions of the script had a lot of funny bits with Joy and Fear, but it didn't go anywhere and didn't have much of a point to it. He worked on it constantly for months after that trying to crack it.  Whereas, when the Minons team got to the point they obviously just said, "Fuck it, good enough" and called it a day.   I thought it was good. Not great. Not amazing. Good.  The characters were good, but the story was kind of a muddle.  It might have been better of they had focused more on the individual character arcs and waited until the second season to hit hard on the evil sens8 corporation.   Being familiar with the work of the Wachowskis and Straczynski, it was interesting to see them each take turns riding their particular hobby horses.   One of the few reasons left to actually go to the movie theater is that it's a distraction-free environment. I can seat in my seat, eat my overpriced popcorn and, for a blissful two hours or so, focus solely on the screen. No calls. No texts. No e-mails. No knocks at the door. No sad looks from the dog because he wants a treat. Just me and the film.  Just sit there, be quiet and watch the movie for fuck's sake.   As has been pointed out ad nauseum, he was in no way facing 35 years in prison. He was offered a plea deal of three months and it's unlikely, given Federal sentencing guidelines, that he would have been sentenced to more than a couple of years if he went to trial and was convicted.  Also, he was accused of more than just downloading science journals. He caused quite a bit of trouble for the MIT computer staff and his shenanigans have changed the way that people on MIT networks may access JSTOR.  Finally, sad as his death was, there's no evidence that his suicide was related to his prosecution. Swartz was a troubled young man who suffered from depression. He left no note or other indication of why he ended his life.    Sometimes I find it amazing that the human race manages to reproduce.    Present tense is acceptable for headlines for events that happened in the recent past.  "Florida Man Jumps Into Alligator Pen"  Although, in this case, it's a bit misleading. My fault for being lazy and not rewriting it.    I don't remember Blade Trinity being all that bad, although truthfully I don't remember much of it.   I do remember watching it over at this chick's apartment and, in the opening scene the title says "Syria" and there's a sweeping aerial shot of the desert and it stops on this giant, pyramid thing. The girl I was with stands up and yells at the screen, "There are no ziggurats like that in Syria! There are no ziggurats like that in Syria!"  In that moment I knew that someday she would be my wife.       So...you've been working for free for the last two months?  You should probably speak to an attorney at this point. You're probably going to have to sue them to get your back pay.   That was my title, but I thought it was a fair summary. I wanted to add a little extra info in case Redditors didn't recognize Blazer's name.  I think he still counts as a whistleblower, even though he only did so under threat of prosecution.    Getting or giving?   Well, he did also take bribes and stuff.   He told the truth and cooperated with authorities  so that he could avoid going to prison.   To be fair, he did admit to taking bribes and all other kind of illegal shit. He probably deserves the ban.  On the other hand, if they imposed this equally, they'd probably have to ban at least half of FIFA.            I don't know. I never bought or sold anything there. Redditors on other threads have said it worked well for them.  Thing is, I have no problem with Reddit closing the marketplace. Sometimes you try something new and eventually you realize that it's not really working or it's not profitable or a distraction from your core competency or whatever. I don't think there's any moral imperative to keep services up and running forever.   But, if you're going to close it down, give people some notice for fucks sake. Let people have at least a little time to work out a transition plan. What kind of shit-tastic organization shuts down a bunch of online stores without giving anyone any notice at all?   I think Snyder is going to hold on to the name until he can trade the name change for a new stadium deal.   Pronounced Loogey? Bold move, renaming your company a homonym for expectoration.       It's clear that the lesson from this is the same as the one from the recent unpleasantness. You should never ever rely on Reddit for anything.   The people who run the site have show that they'll do whatever they like, without reason or notice, and if people are inconvenienced, unhappy or otherwise left hanging, that's their own issue.    As a Hymie from Hymie Town (actually Hymie Island, east of Hymie Town), I was never a big fan of the Reverend Jackson. I always saw him as a self-important, self-aggrandizing, blowhard. But this makes him pretty much the same as 95% of the political class.  Now I never liked him, but black people, a large majority of them, loved him and still love him.  For a long time he was one of the few black people who could get the mainstream media to listen to him. When there was a racial issue, Jesse would fly in and help shine a light on it, get it some media attention.   And the racists, of course, hate him for that. Because the story of modern racists is that there is no racism. Anyone who tries to convince you that there is still racism and that racism is a still a problem is a con-artist, a "race hustler" in the parlance of the racist shit heel.  Has he done some bad things in his life? Sure. Pretty much all great men or those who aspire to greatness are serious assholes in one way or another.  But the inchoate rage that he inspires is people is all out of proportion for the things he's done or purported to have done.   Look at the whole Hymie Town incident. To say he handled that badly would be an understatement, but it was over 30 years ago and people still want to throw that brick at him whenever his name comes up.   Just like the racists who are giving your comment all the down votes.    No. He has no right to grab her wrist at that point.   If he really felt that that that drunkenly raised fist with her arm bent fully at the elbow and pointed at her own ear was a threat he could have raised his hand to ward it off or taken a step back.   Instead he grabs her arm and roughly twists it downward. He had absolutely no right to do that.  She want to break free of his hold, so she raises her right knee and then comes across with a weak left.  At that point, again, the correct action is push off and step back. Instead he pops her hard in the face and then lets go and walks away.    He's awesome in it.      Seriously? Pearl Harbor and Nagasaki jokes after winning a soccer match?   I guess some people think that's funny...or something.  	85
 Yeah I've seen a lot of that but I'd rather have buttercream. Thanks.   I made an ice cream cake (two vanilla cakes with some strawberry ice cream in between) and it is currently in my freezer setting up in a spring form pan. I want to put some icing on it and maybe practice decorating, but I don't know what will freeze well. My roommates are gone for another week but there's no way I'm waiting for them to get started on this thing. So my question is what icing will hold up to being taken in and out of the freezer while I slowly devour this cake over the course of the next week or two? Will buttercream be okay? Thank you.   Wish I could add an extra upvote for rowing. Have a good trip!   I have a Polar FT4 and after about 7 months of use it started giving me erratic readings (ave hr of 45, max 205 for a steady state day on the water) but I machine wash it once a week and it now works fine. So whatever you buy make sure you wash that chest strap.   A couple of people I know really like them, but I'm not a big fan. The first few times I sculled with them was in bad weather, and it really irritated my wrists and forearms. I had tendonitis in my wrists a couple of years ago, and it felt like the extra effort it took to square and feather started to bring that back, especially in the choppy water. I try to avoid them just to keep my wrists happy but better and more experienced scullers than me really like them.  	5
    Soylent Green-tastic!   This particular warning ("harmful programs") I think is related to PUP (Potentially Unwanted Programs), things like programs with toolbars and other stuff that's set to install by default during the installation routine, or ads that lead to sites that offer these kind of downloads.   If a site has been hacked or is offering actual malware (the virus/trojan kind), or is a phishing site, Chrome displays slightly different warnings (see: https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/99020?hl=en).  Google has been very active in labeling "harmful program" sites lately - it recently blocked SourceForge for the same reason.   Being self employed has its perks sometimes ...   I have my base set up similar to the linked screenie in smuttyinkspot's post, maybe with defenses more closely together, and more mines on the sides to discourage flanking. The weakness in this kind of base design is always the flanks, as once you get past the front defenses towards the production buildings at the back, it's game over basically. The advantage is that attackers are overwhelmed the minute they set foot on the beach, so they have to spend a lot of GBE destroying defenses before they land.  I leveled up the HQ and then upgraded the shock launcher as a priority, as its relatively large coverage wreaks havoc with attackers with this kind of denser base design.  To defend against warriors, you might want to upgrade the flamethrowers and have them closer to your HQ, along with upgraded machine guns. The flamethrowers are currently too far away and can only do damage to one side of the HQ for each flamethrower, as opposed to all four sides at the same time when placed right next to the HQ. Also wouldn't hurt to have more high DPS defenses covering the HQ, to pick off the warriors in a single shot.  Also for the OP, you have a pretty high VP count for your level - it's gonna be tough to defend bases against players that are leveled to the high 40s, regardless of your strategy. So focus on upgrading your defenses if you find you're losing most of the loot you earn to home base attacks (I prioritized upgrading boom cannons, sniper towers, cannons, rocket launchers, flamethrowers around the HQ, machine guns around the HQ in this order before I got to level 17 and got the shock launcher).  	5

 It's also a TV Channel in Malaysia costing RM10.60 (2.80 US Dollar)  The cheaper price means that you don't have the VOD option and you are stuck with what they show on the network  http://www.astro.com.my/whats-on/channel/wwe-network-hd/285  As you can see, they are just looping 3 or 4 shows a week. But since  the PPV is cheap (it cost around USD10 before this, so it's now 5x cheaper I just buy it for the PPV)   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPhMyg6aA8s  Kerwin White      http://i.imgur.com/MCLW3kE.jpg  Apparently I have found them      the picture is at it is, meaning it was not changed as /u/tomF1 said.    I'll try see if they are still doing Caterham stock clearance locally. They were sold by Al Ikhsan in Malaysia and I thought i saw some outlet still stocking them last month   Umm no  http://imgur.com/a/GtPgI   Did I..  "Woooo"  Did I..  "Woooo"  Did I..  "Woooo"  Did I just saw Darren Young unleashing some barrage on BRRROCK LESNAR during that melee?     I never have a mechanical keyboard before so I hope i can win :   But McLaren and Senna had used #27 too, and that was iconic in it's own right since that was the year Senna won the championship.     iirc they usually choose tracks that can offer them cheap price for testing, which is why testing are usually on weekdays to save further money   You can get a hybrid Lotus Elise for cheaper to be honest   There is one more factor. Trainwreck  The moment I heard the movie is out the week before battleground I knew Cena would win      That Bella is making the match flow jerky.    John "Blocking" Layfield  HAHAHAHA I LOVE IT MAGGLE!   Counter Strike: GO   During the "WWE List" show once, Miz said this: "Cena always portrays himself as the underdog, but he never once was. Only when he was facing Brock Lesnar that you feel that he might actually loose"       Miz is awesome on the mic once he has his confidence and felt like a natural heel. Hence why he had that wwe championship run  Morrison was meh... At best. Never really remembered any significant promos that he did, even when he was the ECW champ   Hall of Pain Mark Henry using the chair on Big Show's ankle. Damn that was horrible to watch                     You can build a fully functional 6mm gun using only LEGO parts   I thought there is an auto mode where it's only function when there is low light?

Meaning if you're in Japan you won't get njpw stuffs on the network like how the network is TV only in Malaysia without VOD  Thing is it WILL introduce current network subscribers to NJPW which would help their exposure in the USA   This is the best thread I've read today   Most likely this   A really sad news for motorsports in general. Not only F1. A promising young star. His Monaco race will forever be remembered by me as one of the best drive by a racer in an underperforming car   It think it was directly due to that incident. The management clearly has an SOP now of what to do when it happens again   Have Sasha in their stable and then for a PPV have Snoop Dog cameo   Same. I need to find that promo as well   Not to mention that welder prone to overheating. That's dedication for you         WELCOME! TO WEDNESDAY NIGHT WARS!   Good for him. And since football has a stringent drug test, especially in Europe WWE will be having a monster sized performer that should be drug free (barring any loophole stuffs)  Still remember him from the Bundesliga, and they could even make a storyline of him talking shit to the USA crowd about how Germany is no 1 in football and USA never go far in the World Cup. Instant heat   1 - Book a date opposite each other  2 - have NJPW send superstars to each promotion on that same date  3 - Make a fake war and calling each other out on twitter  4 - Having a crossover angle  5 - ???  6 - Profit!!!   No. The tyre wear was not as good as their expected, and they made the wrong call to pit under the safety car.   On something different, but quite similarly weird when talking about modern F1, Benneton and Schumacher tested an all wheel steering F1 car, where the rear tyres angles inwards when the front tyres is steering.  In theory it should mean the car is more steerable. In practice, it was not faster than a normal car. The system was ditched and the FIA promptly banned it (only two front tyres can steer the car rule)  Found the article: http://www.f1fanatic.co.uk/2007/03/22/banned-four-wheel-steering/   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYLmEadKmCw  Those Audi are awesomely silent  Porsche sounds quite similar to F1's V6  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mr4Z58oGmEc   Bloody hell the car never goes straight throughout the run   Because we finally see the impact of those moves on the wrestlers. Honestly after watching beyond the mat, I cringe at worthless impact move that damage the body just to get a pop from the fans   Someone who worked in WWE already posted here that it was. The problem with that particular slammy was that smarks that resented Reigns did not vote at all. Which means that kids and women that liked him voted and giving him the win   Tony "Schovantey"   But.. the Slammy's vote is legit :/   Wow. Now that's screwing people up. And now I am more less likely to blame TNA for it      The reason for lack of managers? Cost. Any extra head that they don't need to transport to an event or pay for appearance is a cost saved.   Hmm. more likely his contract for performing is already finished but there is a clause for him not to appear in any other TV wrestling shows until LU's season has finished?  Reminder that LU's taping is longer than any other promotion, hence I think Hernandez didn't have work for so long that he thought it was okay to work?  either way it was fucked up by both TNA and Hernandez      He's always been good there. Winning in 2009 when everybody is saying it was just a one off pole still is up there in my mind.  heck he nearly won last year if not for his misfiring engine meaning he does not have enough power to pass Nando at the end   Thank you. As a non native English speaker, I know the title is wrong, I just don't know what it was   did it even have any WWE personnel in it?      Everytime Cena is on commentary, it bores me. He has this calm, droning voice that never changes no matter what happens in the ring. He tries to get people over, but for some reason his timing is off and he cuts off other commentators and tend to talk over them.   Last night during the triple threat match it was really annoying to hear him. Thank god the match itself is good that he was easily filtered out  There are people like William Regal, that is calm on commentary but makes it work. He managed to convey enthusiasm and character in his commentary no matter how calm he sounds. But not Cena.   indeed. but it takes time to actually find that perfect character. You can be the best wrestler in the world but nobody would find you entertaining if you're character is not over with the fans.     8 p.m. 3.43 million viewers  9 p.m. 3.51 million viewers  10 p.m. 3.65 million viewers  That's actually quite impressive as more people are tuning in. Usually the number drops off after 10 pm   Sasha brings the Power of Positivity!   Gab 2007 has a flying Raymond Stereo when he was not on the card as well  https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/9c/The_Great_American_Bash_%282007%29_film_poster.jpg   PES 14 only has 16:9/4:3/5:4 support so I expect similar issues   Note that you need 3 exact same monitors for Nvidia Surround, but any 3 monitors will work with eyefinity.   Eyefinity NEEDS to use the display port for one of your monitor tho. Most of the NVIDIA cards support surround on DVI/DVI/HDMI   The New Day of the Divas Division   officially launching tomorrow  "Hi. We are pleased to announce that WWE Networks will be launching on the Astro platform on 15th July 2015. To subscribe, you may refer to Astro Service Portal on Channel 200, call 603-9543 3838 "   I thought it was cheaper during Steam Summer Sales the other day? In any rate if you don't have a console and just want something to waste your time this is good enough. 2K made a good port (both keyboard and controller support). The only thing I hate is the lack of roster depth and the repetitive 2K career mode thing. God I hate that.  Thank god for trainers...         I need to ask how many times has Bran signed a new contract while Nick was in TNA   The fia medical team usually will test a driver if he has a prior health issue. Schumacher had to do it after he broke his leg in 99   Race day  Go to onboard channels  Hope that the driver that has the onboard that weekend has something interesting  Wait  ???  Profit!!   Btw the UI on the video means that Rosberg was one of teh drivers that was fitted with the onboard camera by FOM that weekend, and this was recorded from teh onboard channel shown during race weekend   A blank page?   The one in charge of the race footage just missed an overtaking manouvre. Wtf      https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VV8FuAWUvE  Kerwin White   And the streak... is over   Darude - Sandstorm   http://i.imgur.com/T23kp8w.gifv  Holy shit that crash   Depends on your definition of real. Racing teams change ownership and rights throughout the years that it's hard to really keep track on who carries which legacy. IMO only Ferrari and Williams are still who they are as they were when they started.   even the current McLaren is actually continuation of Ron Dennis's Project four racing team that merged with the original McLaren racing team but they kept the McLaren heritage.   *Whoopdeedoodee I am just driving this forklift and I will ignore all the racket that is happening above me*      1. There should be an incentive to finishing higher, hence why the point gaps will always goes smaller the lower you finishes.   2. A close point gap means that a consistent driver  a fast driver. You could end up with a driver that does not win any race in the season finishing top. Something that happened once in Moto GP's 125cc category when the champion never won any race that year.   3. Reason 2 was why the current points scoring system was introduced. The previous point scoring system was criticized for not giving the "winningest" driver the most points.    Too many stories about it i think. I might have heard another version that yours.   Makes sense tho, since the WWE Championship went to Smackdown! and the WHC went to RAW   1 - They wanted to  2 - No TV station wanted the WCW brand. AT ALL  Vince wanted to keep the WCW brand as a seperate entity as his roster was too big. But there were no TV station that wanted to carry it due to the stigma it had. He offered the network that carrying SmackDown at the time to put WCW on SmackDown's slot, but it was quickly shot down. Hence we had that stupid invasion angle and the death of WCW. But we have the roster split down the road, just as Vince wanted            Not showing the sweater puppies  http://i.imgur.com/qmMehtQ.jpg  I am dissapoint      WHAT IS BILL GATES DOING IN THE IMPACT ZONE?   It's a good opinion. but there is a reason LU can pull it off. For one, they are taped for a while back, and hence, why they could produce all those awesome looking camera angles and such, because they have time. Try being live, or taped with a time constraint (taping that is needed to be shown in a few weeks, instead of month for example) and I doubt it would still keep the same feel  Also it's too niche. I for one could still suspend my reality while watching TNA/WWE/ROH, but with LU, you have to watch it like watching a TV series/soap opera. There is no nagging feeling like something would blow up and change the industry, like the pipe bomb, or Jeff Jarret's GFW invading TNA. That reality factor IMO is severely lacking at the moment   Rowdy Roddy Piper is related to the Hart family   hahaha, cosplay Rin just for fun then! There is nothing wrong in that   Not as mich as she used to. She did some Kancolle last year  I was supposed to meet her for an interview during FuyuComi last year but she cancelled it last minute :/   I wish the guy would have used landscape, because then we can see face of everyone when KO says that      I think some moves were new to the match and has yet to have a WWE name  Bloody Sunday for instance is not a PG friendly name and IIRC Finn has yet to use it in NXT hence the pregnant pause when he used it as I think Cole was in a conondrum.    I started with anime Most, if not all anime OP and ED are now sung by pop artist (anime viewers trnd to buy singles so it's a good place to promo your songs). After a while you tend to gravitate to an artist or group and voila! You have now become a J Pop fan  I mostly only go to concerts in Singapore or Malaysia tho so my choice are limited.    Oh no. Fans usually buys the glow stick. Some are sold outside the concert hall, but hardcore fans would sometimes buy a battery powered version for more impact and longer lasting.  Sauce: I go to J Pop concerts   Hand them out and tell them to use it durinf the title match    fans did, but Johnny ace planned that spot   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qEmzpNMIB7g   I usually called microsoft's helpline whenever I upgraded to another mobo, and says "my old one was broken and I upgraded" and they would reactivate my windows            I remember listening to something similar in Gaki no Tsukai. Is it a generic Japanese riff music or something?   Basically bleacher report?   To add to that, Toto also said the guys from Brackley gave them the rain alert and how fast it was moving to the circuit.  In the end it was a sum of a lot of things but luck was not one of them   Then you better call somebody     from between 1809 and 1917      Make it similar to Cesaro. Have Roman lose with distraction, and down the line, Roman could say "Hey I nearly beat you, how about a 1 on 1 without any distractions or interference this time" and voila! A PPV match   It would be a win win situation, as Cena is right now making anyone that challenges him looks really good. Have Roman fighting the best he could, and the moment he looked like he could win, Bray will then come out and cost him the title. It would then make him angry with Bray more, as he would now cost him the Money in the Bank, stalk his daughter and costing him a title. They would be red hot going in Battlegroud  But then again, I won't expect any of this to happen   Jeff Jarret came out to promote GFW. Promises JJ vs HHH   SkySports says that Austria counts.    Actually the FIA and FOM knows this. Hamilton has a scruffy middle sectpr in the rain and Crofty immediately says "according to this Hamilton has run wide at Stowe" with "this" meaning the FIA info and he also said "Raikkonen has an off whilr we were not looking"   Orton and Cena was from the same development territory IIRC, which would explain that they are close   Depends. for me a stunner by any other wrestler is just a normal move. A stunner by Stone Cold? Well you better get a bed ready coz you ain't gonna stand back up from that      Will he come with Raymond Stereo as well?   ART is kinda McLaren/Honda junior team with Stoffel Vandoorne (McLaren) and Matsushita (Honda Dream Project) in the team  Ferrari has their Junior academy I think, but not a team per se. Bianchi and Marciello (GP2/Trident) is in this program. Note that Perez was also from their Junior Academy.     I think they also planned for a while that the '16 game will be named 2K 3:16 or similar   It's gone now :/   With the FIA monitoring radio, I think they would know that it's fake since the team would notify the driver to box if it was real   Yes, and even in the GP2 race Stanaway from 3rd passed both Vandoorne and Sirotkin at the start, so 3rd definitely has some more grip than pole and 2nd         More like they should have let Bottas through before the first stop. But then again Bottas was massively slower in the wet, so it won't have changed much   With NJPW having an awesome event the day after their house show, WWE needed to send their fans happy   WWE's camera crew did not come to Japan. It was done by a local station, JC sports, which shows WWE on their channel in Japan.   Note that they are not actually perfect tho. There are some cases that WWE's style is better. For example when Finn was outside slamming into KO on the barricades, They followed Finn from behind, making it looks slower and less impactful. WWE under Dunn would shot it from the front making it look like it was a high impact move   There was a race I remember of Button's strap was loose, and he had to race with one hand holding it tight    Edit: it was 2004. He managed to get 2nd http://www.autosport.com/news/atlasf1-report.php/id/14058/   I've seen her naked. She's not ugly that's for sure   Holy fuck I love how KO fully embrace being heel.   "I don't care I hate this stupid country and everything in it"  "C'mon let's count together" (while Finn was out)  Throwing the flowers away  "You see? This is stupid" (talking about the streamers)      Finn looks.. apprehensive? Scared? Whatever it is, it adds more drama and emotion to the match   http://i.imgur.com/t1UWgnU.png  Watching this at the same time with Formula 1. This is a good week   Linda McMahon  	145
 My boyfriends family is from Spain and I really want to make authentic Morcilla de Burgos (morcilla with rice). Anyone have any tips on finding the best recipe for this? Thanks in advance!   "Grow up."   At first I thought this was a movie adaptation of "Les Revnants" which is a pretty sweet french show... Still, this looks great!   I 100% agree with this! Children are much more intelligent than people give them credit for.   That's a great way to explain it! Putting yourself in their perspective and keeping it simple. I like that.    I've always wondered how different people experience the concept of death and their own mortality.

That's great to know! This helps me with the decision immensely    New brakes and shifters? My friend said the stem shifters on the Miyata can be more frustrating than the downshifters   Thanks! Talking this guy to $150 seems impossible, though. I agree it seems like a better bike but for the price I think the Miyata has more value if I just pay to fix it up a bit    Good point. The Miyata will require the girl to drive 30 minutes out of her way to deliver, though, so I feel like I'd need to commit to it if I were to ask her to come out here   That's how I felt... Unless this bike rode like a dream, $300 seems high. I just don't want to get ripped off if the Miyata is a compareable bike for more than half the cost   The nishiki apparently was just tuned up and got new tires... I do plan on using a rack and panniers so I wasn't sure which price was more reasonable... The Miyata looks like it's in good condition but it may need a tune up and I'll need to get a rack installed...   The nishiki apparently was just tuned up and got new tires... I do plan on using a rack and panniers so I wasn't sure which price was more reasonable...   Do you think the $100 bike is up to snuff in comparison? I was going to give the Nishiki guy my old commuter bike in hopes he'd knock off $85... I was going to give the bike away anyway but it's still a decent bike and salvageable    While value is important, having a bike that is worth the investment is more important to me. Could someone who actually knows what they're talking about take a peek at these two bikes on CL and tell me which I should go for? It would be for commuting mostly.  All help is super appreciated!!!

    I'm making this my Twitter banner hory shat this is good   This. People need to realize, especially at this age, that shit gets better.   Jansport. I currently use my Cousins from like '97 or something. Those last 5ever.   Can confirm. I'm a 14 Year Old going into Sophmore year and around 3/4 of my friends smoke either weed or cigs. I personally could give a shit what *they* do, since it doesn't affect me.   He loves you too, DrowningKittens.   Mush.   Everyone is dressed all fancy like and stuff.  Then you have Em.   Penis   What law firm and where is it because I only will trust them.   There is no Tongue Swap, the 6 top is just sewn on. You can still see the old Roshe tongue.    douche canoe!    The things that take one USB port and split it into multiple.  How doesn't the data get confused and mixed up when transmitted in one line?   Hey, my friend wrote an article on this site.   I read that as Jose... not Jos.   Well, we now need context of 'soon'. We've heard a 7 second snippet of it, so we need to know what 'soon' means. A month? 3?   Yeah, but would they design a whole new entire shoe for one commercial?   Some Roshes or Chucks.   For casual wear or to ball in?      Oh, I'm sorry, must have missed that. My apologies   Might need a bit of a cleaning lol. Good find   Since I'm not too big on Foams I actually think the Penny's reign superior in this pack. But, that's just me.   Check the major retailers' websites first. Nike, Footlocker, Champs, etc. to see if they have the colourway you want. If not, then go to eBay. As /u/stewpidteenager said, *get a legit check first*.

 I can't even fathom this.    Well we have a saying:   Don't let the perfect be the enemy of the good.   Last three hours before my candidacy, I just said screw it, closed my books, and watched a film which I had watched and enjoyed a lot in my childhood. I enjoyed it again, and forgot that the mess called grad school existed.   I passed my candidacy.         And yet sadly, the calm, boring guys are often the heroes.   Somebody had two male lovers - in that person's own words, and   It is believed he was gay.   He was gay, and was a genuine military hero. Both things can and do coexist.   Because let them contribute something worthy first. Let an RSS ideologue make a film of Mrinal Sen calibre first, then we will have something to talk.   I am referring to the song - [DJ waley Babu](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OulN7vTDq1I). How does such utter garbage become popular? Are we so utterly devoid of talent?   Ultimately in a country where a shit song like [DJ waley Babu](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OulN7vTDq1I) is becoming insanely popular what else can you expect? Certainly not class and intelligence.   And he was gay too. So one of the founders of the modern American military was gay, and we did not let them serve?  Why were we so stupid?   Watch [Bakita Byaktigato](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT_fFFFtctk). I linked it to the full youtube video, and while the film is in Bengali, the video is decently subtitled. It is partly a movie about romance, though I will better characterize it as a movie about *leela*.  In my opinion, it is probably one of the best 100 films ever made in India.   Even Lal Bahadur Shastri's death could be added to your list.   Open one in Texas, and name it Jade Helm.   Welcome. Have some wine. You were me 5 years back, and I hope that you find some peace, while not forgetting your humanity and your anger.   Sure. But everyone around you will think that you are immature.   I personally don't agree with the article at all. The second page of the article is an incoherent mess, bordering on Breitbart style lunacy.  But I find the article very illuminating, as these views are definitely not fringe, but are actually mainstream GOP electorate positions today.      There are two important reasons for that - reasons that are pretty obvious, but Mr. Murthy refuses to address them.  Big corporate ideas come from fresh undergraduates, and big scientific ideas come from fresh graduate students (a.k.a PhDs). Rather than the Indian education system, it is the India outside the university that has done its utmost best to squeeze these graduates. Keep in mind that many of India's undergrads are coming from shaky financial foundations. The societal and parental pressure to accept a stable, high-paying job is often immense. There goes your big corporate ideas. Thankfully, however this situation is rapidly changing, and the future does look bright.  When it comes to research, everyone blames the IITs and even IISc, but has anyone ever stopped to ask the question, "How much do we pay our graduate students?" Till a year back it was Rs 15,000 pm. The best and brightest undergrads go to USA for their PhD, and do not return. Multiple big inventions have been made by Indian born US scientists, so yes that talent pool was always there. And even after completing a top notch US grad degree only the extremely patriotic come back to India. An assistant professor at an IIT gets paid Rs 40,000 pm. Even after taking into purchasing power parity, an assistant professor at an IIT gets paid a third of what he would earn in USA.   So Mr. Murthy, here is your answer - you pay peanuts - you get monkeys - not Nobel laureates. But isn't that the way you always ran Infosys yourself?   I think Ganguly cleaned it up better than Sachin.  	20
    And the reality is that people are changing every day. Both people need to be prepared to support the other to grow as a human being but it doesn't occur to a lot of people.   I feel the same, but I think I'm just getting older.    Not if you're left handed with t-Rex arms like me!   I think that if you want further guidance that is written in a more accessible way you should read The Untethered Soul. It really put forward these concepts in a way I could relate to, as I found that Tolle comes across as a little bit too "out there".  If I could sum it up in one sentence, try to be the attention but not the judgement.    So if those two cops in The Other Guys had just done backflips they would have landed safely in the bushes?!   Who in their right minds would ban such a glorious bot?   It appears I have somehow summoned a bot. Strange that when I want them they're nowhere to be seen!   Ohh of course, I wasn't thinking about the bar as well! Thanks!   Why is it that 225lbs is such a big deal in weightlifting? 100kg in UK makes more sense as a landmark, 225lbs seems a bit random.   And is anyone else kind of, dare I say it, glad that those particular subreddits were banned?   Hey I think I have the perfect solution for you. I literally just finished this men's 30 day yoga challenge yesterday and absolutely loved it. It's only ~10 minutes a day and now I'm just excited to do more!  http://www.doyouyoga.com/course/the-mens-30-day-yoga-challenge/   Hey FluffleUffle,  I've had a similar experience before where I thought a symptom was a bad sign, by worrying about it I became hyper-vigilant and much more aware of even the slightest sensation.   Headaches and anxiety go hand in hand - you probably don't realise but your anxiety makes your whole body cave in and hunch. This includes your shoulders, head and neck. Try and become aware of any tension you are holding as it is not uncommon for anxiety to cause tension headaches, which in turn feeds the anxiety.  Have you given any consideration to trying mindfulness? This might help you become more aware of these processes and help you to prevent them before they get to the point where you get a headache.  Personally I ruined three months of my life thinking I had cancer. When I finally found out that I was completely healthy I was angry at myself for wasting so much of my time being miserable. Go to the doctor if you think this one-off reassurance will help you. But don't let the Doctor's reassurance become a crutch.  Good luck, you can do it :)   Yep there's always going to be a physical component to anxiety. I'd recommend trying some relaxation techniques to counteract it. Letting yourself get tense makes the anxiety worse and causes a sort of feedback loop. Letting yourself relax will have the opposite effect.  The mind affects the body but the body can affect the mind too.    I know that a couple of supermarkets got in trouble a few months ago for selling multipacks that were more expensive than buying the items individually, so there must be someone out there with a desire for justice. And savings.   Actually I think the U.S. probably teaches better grammar than the UK. Most UK students can use the English language but don't understand it (myself included).   I'm British, a simple "hello" should suffice.  	17
