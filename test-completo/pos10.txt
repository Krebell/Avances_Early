 So many unwanted Smith fadeaways.   Hey guys, Celtics fan here pulling hard for the Rockets to win it all. Huge Harden fan. I'm wondering if anybody has a stat of how many total mid range jumpers the Rockets took during the regular season. I know they don't take many, even less before Josh Smith, but if anybody has the total that'd be sweet. Go Rockets!   Well he got 2 tonight so maybe he'll be able to scrape together some AB's. I agree with you though   I mean he'll get pinch hits and an occasional day but I'm afraid he's gonna lose his swing or something   Yeah you're probably right. Oh well.    I guess that's true. You make a valid point   but he's just watching. he's not going to get any playing time with our core back and healthy and playing so well, I would just rather him stay hot and keep hitting.   I just think I'd rather have him getting everyday at bats instead of sitting on our bench with Clint Robinson and Danny. I'd rather him getting the consistent at bats even if it is against AAA pitchers. What do you guys think?   Why can't Carpenter be good against everyone but us. Curse you fantasy...   I can only assume "cash" means we're getting [this guy.](http://www.korkedbats.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/LLWS-Pics-Cash-Money-2.jpg)   Bryce=GOAT   I have Carpenter and Heyward on my fantasy so I don't know what I want. Just kidding, FUCK THE CARDS    Kelly GOATlynyk putting on a Kelly Oclinic right now   #STOREIT   Hey guys, we're winning. This is crazy. Guys check it out!   I know I'm 5 months late to this, but I need this. So thank you person, thank you  	16
 Yeah he moved across the country, essentially to be with me.  And when he did I was so sure without a doubt that we would be together for quite some time.  If I do end it, he probably has to move back home with his parents, and that would be it for us.  No chance ever again if I decided it was the wrong idea.   That is true, I never really thought about it being the pill?  Or the anti-depressant.  Being in this haze of depression really fucks up your thinking sometimes.  Maybe I should quit my birth control pill cold turkey, and talk to my doctor about the antidepressant.    I feel exactly the same way about problems.  Like, right now, I just want to run away, be alone, on a beach or in a room, and not talk to or deal with anyone in person. That can't be healthy.   I agree about the relationships evolving part.  I've really thought about it.  I'm a pretty big "realist" when it comes to romance, marriage, etc, I've always known that love isn't like in the movies, or that sometimes, you love them, you just don't always like them, as the saying goes. But sometimes... I find it's not just rut, it's that I'm literally not attracted to being with him.  We haven't had sex in about 3 months (partly because of an illness on my part though) but I find myself not wanting to...with him.    I think part of me wants to be independent too.  Whenever I used to think of milestones like graduating school, moving to X place, buying a house, whatever, he used to be there in my mind.  But now it's just me.    It's like in How I Met Your Mother, where Lily leaves because she doesn't know who she is outside of their relationship.  I don't now who I am, how can I properly give someone else love?   Good point.  I just feel like I've screwed up so much.     Technically, not loving him. But I've been feeling ehhh for a while with my life anyways.  But I'm also scared to be alone :/  	5
 Welp, back to the practice rooms I go!   Damn, as someone who's just starting their voice training and wanting to do something like this, I want to know if you need any particular credentials to audition (Masters, how much sight singing experience, etc)?   I will never unhear this   There's no negation, you can have both of them up at once.   Do go on.   This is basically how I operate as well, make basic pulls unless someone asks me to pull more.    YOUR PARTY WAS BAD AND THEY SHOULD FEEL BAD! AND THAT TANK IS A DISGRACE TO ALL TANKS!

 How much sex goes on?  How much underage sex goes on?   No. Eating more ice cream and want to punch everyone in the face.   Naw asked to fuck and he ignored me, even though he brought it up    I wanna say no. I think they get their beans from a tube so...   I'm veg and get bean tacos. You have to be a lax vegetation though, esp since they partner with kfc    21. I'm not sure, some HGTV thing but I'm more interested in my phone. Coffee with a bagel dipped in is good. I'm actually a breakfast cook. French toast is a goodie. You can use bread with egg whites, cinnamon, vanilla, and splenda. Or potatoes and eggs with mayo. Or an egg white, spinach. Onion, pepper omelet! Healthy and low cal. Serve with plain Greek yogurt and splenda   Do you think being white would get you in a different position than you are now? I don't mean this as a joke, I'm curious of your view on race in this industry and your city.   Yes but already I can pretend they're all robots behind a computer.    A psychic told me i was in a covenant in a past life and hatred it.  I want mashed potatoes mixed with corn. Does taco bell have this?   What's your race? Do you have kids? What state are you in?  You should start being nice and apologetic and shit so if they do find this thread, you'll get some brownie points.   I wanna write you too! Never done that before. I'd imagine it'd give you a way to pass the time. Good luck dude.   Idk that's very hard. Today probably my sister because it's rare she lets me touch her let alone put my head on her shoulder. Rarities are beautiful. I love both. I hate male humans.    That's incredible. 2015 is on some hoodrat shit. I wish I could give you gold but for now I will give you a big hug and a thank you for being a great human.   I bet you don't ask anything. There's nothing worse than falling in love. I'll remain emotionally unavailable forever.   Droid maxxx. I love it! slightly cheaper than the iPhone and more storage. Great speakers. Swipe text. Highly recommend it! Iphones are overrated.   Yeah, that's where I've been looking and some are interesting but I can't convince myself to go to the free meetup. Idk. Great site idea though.   Tinder. So stupid and trashy.   Brooo....   Thanks. There are some songs on there I never heard before. I should just listen to being as an ocean in repeat. That band hurts in the right way.  Thanks you, good luck to you 3   Yeah you're right, that album is something    Honestly one of the best things for me has been my 6am weekend shifts where I can drive with the windows down, alone on the roads, driving into the sunrise at 5:30. Nature has always been my savior, thanks for the reminder to see the little things.    Thank you   Yeah I just feel bad about my weight and appearance. I hate being around people these days. I  hate when I stop going to the gym and thinking about my lack of perseverance. Gahhhh I need to suck it up and start something at home   I'd rather piss people off and hit a car on my street.  I get what you're saying and appreciate your input. I don't feel overly angry, just aggressive and dangerous. Sigh :(   I did for a second but I'm as our if shape as they come and feel to bad about myself to do anything about it. I'll look up since in my area anyway. Thanks   I'm feeling low as ever. No one should ever have to feel this way, not even my worst enemy. I'm looking for something, a song "deep" and impactful. I'm trying to remember my old 90s/00s emo bands but can't think of anything off the top of my head. I like indie rock and post pop punk and some post hardcore. Any songs relating to depression/suicide that preferably aren't mainly focused on a girl would help. Thank you.   I think it's more of wanting to impact people, fuck them up like I am.   Sorry I won't do as you say. There are different ways to deal with things.   No   No   Depression has taken over me for over a year and now its not just "blah", it is making me want to do bad, dangerous things. I want to bust a windshield, slash tires, not hurt people physically but cause a ruckus and destroy something. I am on buspar I think, may have something to do with it but " blah" sucked. What can I do to cure this urge and not do something stupid? Is this normal?   Just do it   Set up a nice room with dim light, candles, and some other lovey things, take a picture and saw you want to treat her right tonight.   Soap or candle making. Dart leagues   You must not be from America?   Barf!   Still deciding. Probably mushrooms. I hope we get it from the best pizza place EVER. I have wish you could try it. I'll update once it's ordered and in my mouth. Are you a male?   Still around? I'm waiting for pizza. What's your favorite topping? Where are you?!? And traveling to?   Brb I'm eating ice cream   Something to improve the world or industry, preferably one that doesn't target just a small audience.   Chipotle, salsatitas, moes. Plus you can two meals out of one plate.   Same boat! I'm just going to stick it out until February! I'm trying to do things on the side though, like working concessions at a concert or something, joining clubs in the area via meetup. Idk, its going okay... Or just quit now and start traveling!   Fuck yeah. Great story ending gracefully.   Lovely   I don't know anything about Nestle. What's wrong with it? What's with the water?   Did you get with the other girl?   Now I'm craving them.   Congrats   Too philosophical for me.   Seems like you need an adventure. This is the perfect time to travel or take an internship away from home. CC is going to cost a lot in Cali, but I'm not sure about other states on the west coast. Go on a road trip, volunteer, wwoof, workaway, do something. I'm moving coasts next year!   Yeah. One of my college professors asked us if we wanted a midterm. We said no. He said okay. At the end of the year he asked the same thing and we didn't have a final either. Or grade was based on journals we went over in class.   What the hell was going on in his head? I don't mean to be funny when I say this but maybe he liked you and was just immature about it. Or had a disorder because this is just strange.   And it's the opposite for me. Once I started working, I was like, do you really ride the bus? Why don't you have a car, you're already 18! Shane on me. I wish I used public transport or rude my bike everywhere.    You mean beautiful artwork.   This should be a new fad.    This was me. I excelled. I was thorough and quick and smart. Because I have always wanted to kick ass at everything, I have developed great multitasking skills and people are impressed with what I do and the time it takes me. This was great for the companies, but tough on me mentally.  Then I had a breakdown, my therapist brought up ocd in terms of perfectionism, I realized this, stopped giving too many fucks, and calmed myself down. I'm still thorough but not crazy. It's better this way but I'm no longer too dog at work.    I'd ask what he was thinking and how he felt. Then go from there. I can't really say I'd dump him straight away, because its based on his reasoning. Having said that, I hope this never happens. Or, maybe I do. I don't know, I'm a lost 21 year old. Love me.   Drinking your own blood.   Yes! My first thought when reading the title. Could have said Frank for the first season but she really hit the ball out of the park. Which I guess is good for her, if she had to be bad, she was very good at being bad.   Yes, and also repeated fitness jokes with memes, like "never skip leg day" or "do you even lift bro" or "gains for days." Once you saw 10 of them, you don't need more.   Will you be my boyfriend? Check yes or no.   Hot damn. Do you remember the titles?   Yeah, is there a correct answer? I never see balloons on the ground so I don't know. Big mystery, small brain.   When the whole universe was made. With whatever/whoever was making it. I need to know!!!!   Poetic truth.   False, you don't brush your teeth, shower, put on clothes or get out of bed. Sometimes you can't even reach for your phone because it just seems like so much work. You take sleeping pills all day because you literally cannot be awake or living that day. You don't know what to do, you shake and will cry for no reason, probably do something stupid or rude if you are awake, so you think its better to seclude yourself. Plus, you look like shit. It's time to be alone.  The next day you realize you slept through class yesterday and didn't turn in a paper. You start hating yourself, feeling guilty and thinking about how now youre not going to pass the class, then won't graduate, then won't get a good job, the live at home forever, have no love life, be a fat loser, die alone without friends. Your parents yell at you asking why you did that yesterday. All these thoughts together make you even more depressed, so you go to bed, or, you decide to drink the night away. Then, its midnight and you're crying and I texting your ex that doesn't love you, telling him all your problems and how youre a fuck up, how much you love him. Eventually you pass out, wake up, even mor depressed than yesterday (rock bottom keeps going lower and lower). You see the texts. Feel embarrassed. You're in disbelief that you spilled your guts, now he'll never want to be with me again, now that he knows I'm mentally ill. You decide you're going to cut everyone out of your life, the remaining acquaintances you do have.  This all fucks you up and you decide to call into work because you can't be near people today and can't bring yourself to clean yourself up. You feel bad you're letting your coworkers down and leaving them shorthanded. You feel guilty. The cycle repeats.    ~~~ Sc13nCe!! ~~~   Vitamins. Magnesium, vitamin d, b vitamins, and iron (often found in a multivitamin). Eating healthy. People don't realize how much this can affect you, but it does! Fresh food brightens myself overall.  Taking time to yourself to do something you enjoy, like reading or drawing or fingerprinting or walking through the park.  Lifting weights or anything that strains the body. To get yourself to go to sleep, you're supposed to tighten every part of your body, starting and your feet then moving up. But lifting things, this kind of does it for you and relaxes you.   Make a fist. See your knuckles. Start on the left big hump, that's january. It's big so it has 31 days. In between the knuckles is a valley, meaning the next month had less days, which is usually 30but we all know Feb had 28. Continue this mountain and valley thing. The last hump should be July, 31. Start again from the front, that is August, 31. Valley, September, 30. Etc   If your work has a restaurant, do not call the kitchen during their busy hours and ask a cook to stop the 86 things they are doing to come get your coffee and heat it up for you.   Don't say "no, I'm not doing that" to something simple. I will make your job hell.   Sexting   $loan 200  	72
 ahh Okay I think I understand so at the end of the season I'm going to have to big for the player like i would for any other player. if i pay 8-mill and inter pays 10-mill they get him. Is that right ?   Hi everyone I've just started a torino save and I'm not used to italian football as i've never done an italian save so could someone simply explain the co-ownership thing to me ? I have a midfielder who's co-owend by torino and inter ? does that mean he spends one season with me and one season with them or ?   Yeah I think they have a sugar daddy.    You already look a lot better ! keep it up mate we're proud of you.

 Touche!!   For once I would like someone to take care of me, to tuck me in and wake me up with breakfast.  For once I'd like someone to miss me when I'm not there, and think about me when I'm not around.  For once I'd like to be spoilt, like I should have been when I was a child, spoiled with cuddles, kisses, cuddly toys, wine and anything else! For once I'd like to stop pleasing other people and have someone just impress me. Take care of me. Love me.   I'm fed up of taking care of everyone else and not getting it back. Right now I deserve to be looked after. I hate being depressed.    It was a very fun night!          I'm struggling to keep it together, I cannot deal with any pressure right now. Things have been great for me recently but I just can't do it anymore. :(    What do you mean?    I've been depressed for 8 months (diagnosed) and around 4 years undiagnosed. I'm a female, and I work full time. I Still live at home, and I hate my life. I come home after work just to be a slave to my parents. Doing all the things they should do but don't bother. My parents and siblings constantly berate me and tell me I'm not depressed. They refuse to understand why I may be upset, why I take strong anti depressants. My mum refuses to come to the doctors with me so the doctor can explain it. I break down weekly to my therapist about it. I find it exhausting to continuously come home and be asked to wash up, dry clothes, clean up, vacuum. It's frustrating, and physically tiring.   Eurgh. Help.    Well hope things improve! :)   Harley Fae after a book series called Possess. it sounds so magical :)   Oh :( the gym is good! I do that too, therapeutic.   Numb isn't the nicest feeling, but I'd rather that then be close to psychotic. I don't enjoy being emotionally unstable.    I've suffered with depression for a long while, and the worst.thing my SO could ever say is that I'm an attention seeker. He has made the mistake a few times and it breaks my heart as he doesn't realise how it affects me.    Appreciative and caring. Nothing beats that.    I've been on anti depressants for 6 months and I've tried so many different ones like sertraline, citrolopram and another th at I can't quite remember. I work best with citolopram. I do find sometimes I feel numb, but it doesn't make you happy. It just balances out your moods! You can still be happy and take them, it really just balances the serotonin in your brain to make it better balanced. Maybe see a therapist or a councillor whilst taking the tablets. There's no harm in trying them, and stopping if you feel wrong.   Best of luck.    Think positive, and perhaps if you feel yourself getting irritated, take yourself away from the situation and calm down.. take a breather. I get really moody, but people around me know my situation so know I can't really help it. Good luck x  	15
 They remind me a lot of those from the Afghan Girl picture from National Geographic    Nah   Galaxy S6   http://imgur.com/wOYlf3z it me   I love paper airplane and it's the coolest thing but I honestly find it super rude when people throw them while there are people on stage taking. It's like I wanna go apologize for them.   When guys make derogatory or negative comments about a girl's appearance. If he's talking to his buddies about how fat Lisa is and how far apart Hannah's eyes are, then I don't want to know what he's saying about me.   I have to stay up late tonight so talk to me!   Annamarie225 16/F   Congrats! Your video low key made me cry. You guys deserved it!   That just made my morning.   Because they're in AP chem. That would be why they mentioned the AP.   On our last test on buffers and ka and kb I got a whopping 48%         This song is so beautiful. I was about to post it myself.   Damn this is a great song. The "you're just jealous cuz we're young and in love" part still gives me chills. Does anybody know if Brand New has made any statements about recording new music?   Mom I didn't fail that math test, I was hacked   For sure. Life goals.   I've never heard that! My eyes and nose do kinda look like hers but my jawline is nothing like hers. Our first and last names are very similar though. Maybe she's a future me.      http://i.imgur.com/4Ip91ib.jpg  I like to describe myself as chunky, yet funky.   Idk how much your school prepared you, but for the reading section, DO NOT DO THE FIRST PASSAGE FIRST. It's always prose fiction which is the hardest. Pick any of the other 3 to do first. We were also taught that in the science section, if two of the answers are complete opposites, then one of them is the right answer.   ME TOO AND ITS SO WEIRD AND IM NOT PROUD OF IT. I was just talking about this today. I was telling my friend how I could have the most basic information and in 30 minutes I could know your life story and your mother's best friend's cousin's cat's date of birth.

It's not. They were references to the reading portions of the PSAT. They had an section comparing training kids to training dolphins, and a section about this guy who went to the Grand Canyon but not really. So yeah, not just random babbling. Lol.   I'm an indie and alternative rock girl, and although I usually don't admit it, I also know how to rock out to Kanye, Childish Gambino, Kendrick Lamar, and Frank Ocean.  I'm a very shy and quiet person, but in my first hour Spanish class, I talk a lot and make a lot of jokes, even though I don't have any friends in that class. No idea why I'm so comfortable in that class. Maybe it's the teacher.  I'm a band student, and most students have that "band kids are great we stick together" mentality, but I think a lot of band kids are really annoying and have huge egos and are sort of douche bags.   Oh yeah.   That's not really a thing to joke about.... Just saying.   Well. Gerbil died this week, my final grade in AP chem is going to be a C+, which is the first grade below a B- that I've ever gotten, my other gerbil is obviously sick, and I've got myself down about a boy. Hopefully next week will be better.  But I made up with one of my friends who I was mad at so that's nice I suppose    Kind of. Loved this dude to no end, then we broke up. And he straight up told me he doesn't like me as more than a friend anymore after about a year of us still having feelings after we broke up. Now he's talking to me less and less and obviously trying to get away from me and it breaks my heart because I can feel him slipping away and I can't handle that. As melodramatic as it sounds I've been flirting a lot with other guys lately, because I figure that if I give myself to guys that don't matter then I'll forget the only one that does. My friends hate him, his friends hate me. We fought a lot and at one point this summer he was being such a dick to me that I told him I was done and I wasn't gonna talk to him anymore. That lasted about a week. Then I smoked weed once in like, September after I promised him I wouldn't (he's really against drugs and alcohol), and then texted him high off my ass. Basically after a spell of us being really good with each other, I broke it and he said "I broke the best bond we've ever had with each other." Then he ran off and his friends found him at the smoke shop because "if she's gonna stoop that low then so am I." And nothing has been the same since then. I love this guy to no end, he's the only thing I ever think about, and he's pushing me away, and I think about it and it just makes my entire body hurt because I know it's completely over and won't happen again. Sorry for the wall of text, but I started typing and it felt good to let it out.   Well I'm currently listening to Some Nights by Fun. But the last full song to grace my ears was Sunburn by Ed Sheeran   Our lead mentor has this really cool alternative playlist that he sometimes plays during build season but half the team complains about it so they're been saying Uptown Funk nonstop. I wish I was joking when I told you that they played it on a loop for 7 hours yesterday.

To take the SAT here, it costs money and isn't required or even necessarily encouraged at my school, so I assume that most of the applicants only take the ACT.

 This one is great, thank you morbo!   Yes, I do. Whenever I have some I take two 25mg hydroxyzine 10 minutes before I dose. I've found that it increases the nod. Can't say for sure whether it increases thr duration though. Comparatively I think it works better than diphenhydramine (Benadryl) for potentiation.   Exactly! Heroin certainly has a way of making you reevaluate your priorities though.   I use subs on a somewhat frequent basis and recently I had a conversation with someone who's been on them for way longer than me and had experience IVing them. He told me the naloxone is almost completely inactive due to buprenorphine having a much higher binding affinity for the mu opioid receptor, essentially 'outcompeting' the naloxone molecules at the receptor sites. Is there any truth to this?  edit: If this were true it would seem to imply that the naloxone would be inactive regardless of ROA   So you have 12 fingers now. Heh   Thought I could be a chipper and avoid the physical thralls of addiction. I still am, for now. But for me the psychological aspect of addiction has proven to be just as devastating as the physical withdrawals one can go through. I was naive to think that using infrequently would not lead to persistent, daily cravings. Intense cravings that eventually lead to rumination and thinking how good that next high will be. Not sure how long my love affair with opiates will last. Probably the rest of my life.   OC 120s??!?! I didn't even know those existed. Great stash, cheers   That's a beautiful rock man enjoy   I understand for the most part we live now in a world where crackheads, drunks and junkies seem to have this kind of hidden feud as to who is the better of the 3...  lol +1 for junkies, spending more time actually being high and less time fiending compared to crackheads is an advantage in my opinion   Thank for the advice. I guess I'll see if there are any major streets or corners in Holyoke so that I'll get a better chance of finding a dealer.   any tips to cold copping in holyoke? im in the 413.   Exactly haha, I've never gotten them for less than 25 a piece. Which is probably why I was so happy in my dream   Last night I had a dream that I picked up a few hundred bucks worth of 30mg oxys for the amazing price of 20 a piece off this girl I know. I was ecstatic, but as I began to crush up the pills I woke up. Needless to say I was very angry and frustrated.  I find this strange though because I'm a chipper and haven't used in over 50 days, even though I still get cravings every day. I realize mine wasn't particularly interesting, but I thought I'd ask here and see if anyone else had any similar dreams they would want to share.   Hahaha. Billy Mays ussd to love coke iirc, RIP   I usually just lurk but I saw someone post about how you were in a coma a while ago. Glad to hear you're doing well and have so much time sober. Stay safe   Love it, thank you for continuing to write stories on a regular basis for this sub.   I have taken up to 3mg xanax at shows before. I don't have a perfect memory of it but it's still not that bad. i have a bit of a tolerance though   yeah i know right the taste lingers too... I'll drink some water and it's still there      Daily limit is 4000mg, you're fine.   This is great, I really like the sense of community here and feel like I can post my thoughts without much fear of judgment. Stay high everyone :)   They do sell gel caps of dope in Baltimore. It's called scramble and it's usually dope cut with quinine to increase the rush when you IV it. It's meant to be IV'd but not snorted.   You're right, I remembered wrong. Just looked up the imprint and they're 8mg.   Haha yeah man it's great! Best stuff I've had in a while   Not as euphoric as Xanax but still good. The only bad thing about them in my opinion is the long half life, so if I take a few too late in the day I'll wake up groggy and still a bit high the next day.   My bad they're 8mg each.   2 pink pills: Adderall 30mg IR   Generic bars: Xanax 2mg   Xanax imprint bars (pressed by a friend): 2.5-2.8mg Xanax   Blue footballs: Xanax 1mg   Orange capsule: Vyvanse 30mg   Orange circle pills: generic Suboxone 8mg   Blue circle pills: generic diazepam 10mg   Bag in the middle: .5g fire Baltimore ECP   Hope you're all having a great Monday :)      Bang that shit    If you don't mind me asking, how's your working memory on this combination, and how do you focus at work without nodding really hard? Obviously if you're shooting .15g you must have a massive tolerance to dope but whenever I combine benzos and opiates my working memory and motivation goes to shit. Is your job very mentally demanding?   You're gonna wait 3 weeks, do it again, wait 2 weeks, then "wait, I don't have to wait this long, i can just use on the weekends, oh wait I should totally reward myself for doing so well with something else in my life i don't need to wait till the weekend, shit now I need more to get high, that guy I got it from was just a middleman and doesn't deal, I need a real dealer, where's my shit I just called him up and he said he'd be here, fuck I feel like shit where's my heroin, I'm bored and just want to get high, nothing else interests me anymore, now I'm sick since I can't afford any, fuck, I've been clean 2 days and it feels like 2 years" This can happen and does happen for a lot of people, be careful.   Yeah we met up earlier this week remember? Being on probation must suck man I wish you the best with your court dates and I hope you don't catch any more charges. Things are alright with me I'm just doing my best to pass all my classes. I'll be around for the summer.   Thank you for posting this, I'm sure I'm not just speaking for myself when I say you are a very inspirational person. Stay positive.  	33
 You have such a way with words.    SO of a shy guy here. He's missed this thread so I'll tell the story.  We lived together in the same halls, after a couple of weeks texting back and forth (nothing too flirty just silliness) a crowd of us went into town. The girls went to one club and the boys to the club next door. We were texting the entire night, much to the vexation of my flatmates.  When the clubs shut and everyone was rounded up a few of us went to the nearest kebab shop for a drunken scran, my food of choice was chips and cheese. Once back at the flat I wolfed down that glorious greasiness amid slagging from my friends.  My flatmates, frustrated at the tension between me and SO, sent us both into the corridor under the instruction we weren't allowed back in until we'd kissed. I was pretty hammered that night, and decided to myself "fuck it" and kissed him. 6 years later we're still together and planning our wedding.  /u/hoboharty this sound about right?   It sucks that the Citalopram didn't work for you but glad to hear your other meds are helping. It's my first time on antidepressants so I didn't know what to expect in the way of side effects.   Glad to know :) just glad I'm not working for the next couple of weeks. Feel like I'm on a different planet half the time haha.   Thanks, I've been reading online about some of the side effects but hadn't anticipated them coming this quickly. I've got another appointment with my doctor in a fortnight so if it's not starting to ease then I'll go over my options.    Not sure about official definitions but this is how I define them:  Fancy dress - generic costume e.g. wolf, mermaid, witch,  Cosplay - dressing in costume as an established character e.g. Teen Wolf, Ariel, Wicked Witch of the West  	6
 Thanks. I get where she's coming from somewhat. I just want this to be resolved one way or another. If she doesn't want me around I can put it out of my head, if she does want me around great, but the different reactions each time I see her is getting tiresome. She probably won't want to talk about it face to face, do you think just texting her to initiate the conversation will work?    This is true, I mean we'll probably see each other sometime this week. It's just at this point a relationship probably isn't going to happen so I'm not getting my hopes up. I'd just settle for things not being weird and us being consistently one way or another.    Well it's been going on for over a month I think she knows how I feel about it. Do you think giving it some space this week might help and then gauge it for the next time we see each other?   What do you think I should say. Would shooting her a text be alright? I don't want this to be a high pressure thing. It's going to be uncomfortable obviously, but I think she'd just try to avoid the uncomfortableness if I tried to get her to meet up. Maybe I should just wait out the week.   This situation with this girl I was seeing before the holidays has gotten pretty complicated since we got back to college. Early in November this girl couldn't spend enough time with me, whenever she was free from work or school she wanted to do something or was texting me. She was getting very emotionally invested in me and I got invested in turn (we were dating pretty seriously) We were starting to have 'relationship talks,' and she confided in me about her problems with anxiety and sometimes depression. We stayed over at each other's places, I met her friends and roommates she met mine. I wasn't someone she was trying to hide.    Then it was like a switch flipped in her head and she decided to be really cold and standoffish with me. We were still hooking up and seeing each other, but it just seemed like she didn't really want me around as much. By middle of December she had me doing the chasing and when we got back from Holidays she broke it off. She just told me she's having a hard time and is completely emotionally unavailable, but still likes me.   We see each other pretty regularly because we work at the campus bar together, but things are weird. Some nights she actively avoids me, or acts uncomfortable around me and other nights she responds to being flirty and teasing.   There was a night a last week where we were hanging out in a group at the bar listening to music and just hanging out. I was talking about a show I'd played that weekend with my band and she got upset with me that I hadn't invited her. I also haven't been texting her, because every time I've asked her to hangout she's been busy or 'busy' and she never initiates texting anymore. She asked me to hangout longer when I thought about leaving. Later when we were alone for a minute she was giving me this pouty face and I asked her how she was doing. She just said terrible and looked me in the eyes, so I kissed her and she reciprocated really aggressively. Like push me against a wall making out. We only got interrupted by a friend bumping into us.   I asked her to hangout over the weekend and she told me she had a lot of work to do (plus she works weekends so I don't know). She does seem to be back to avoiding. She talked to me for all of a minute at a party we were both at the other night and just hovered around her friends. When she's acting cold/uncomfortable I just give her space and kind of pretend she's not there. I know I should just let the whole thing go, I'm honestly a bit hung up, but I'd like to clear the air with her so we can stop awkwardly avoiding each other like we are now.   What do you think? Should I go ahead and just talk to her about it? I just want to ask if we've just decided on being weird with each other now. I haven't been this confused about a girl in a long time, so any advice is appreciated.     ---    **tl;dr**: I was seeing a girl before the holidays, and it seemed like we were moving into a relationship. She admits to having anxiety issues. After the break she tells me she's emotionally unavailable and can't date right now. She's been bouncing back between avoiding me and being very affectionate when I'm around. I don't want to awkwardly avoid each other anymore because it sucks and is much more uncomfortable.    I'm an INFP male and I always feel a little outside of the modern gender dichotomy. The way that I have framed it is that I am more drawn to classical ideas of what it is to be a man than modern ones. It seems to me like many men probably would be. I strive for perfection and admire it, so I love classical music, good wine, great food, fashion, classic literature and aesthetics in almost any medium. I think it's relevant to say I'm heterosexual and identify completely as a male.  I think that maybe we're just prone to more classical tastes and that might come from tendency to be introspective. It's only the popular culture that tries to portray neutral (and often masculine dominated given the history) things like classical music as feminine. I think that there is a much more subdued and mature version of masculinity that should make a comeback. I pictured a mature male INFP as sort of gentlemanly kind of character, but that's my take on it.    I am wasting my potential. I'm just watching all of my opportunities pass me by and I'm not doing a thing about it. I am in a constant state of being frozen by my own fear and I've spent years trying to overcome it, but I just can't. I'm 22 and I'm stuck in the mindset of a 19 year old. I see so many people my age doing great things and taking charge of their lives, but I'm stuck in neutral with the pedal to the floor. Even though I'm in college and studying something I like, I'm not where I could be. I took 2 years to figure out that I hated what I was studying in college, one year being alone and depressed, and two since then trying to piece my early 20s back together.    I'm a musician, but I haven't written a whole song in more than a year and it's killing me I'm so trapped in my own anxiety about actually writing something. I'm classically trained on piano and have taught myself 2 other instruments, but I can't even write a fucking pop song anymore. I'm so stuck I can't even feel things anymore. I see kids just out of their teens writing great music and really starting to get some good shows and I feel like I've wasted so much time and that my time is running out.   Every teacher or professor I've ever had has told me I'm one of the smartest students they've ever had and I've tested as highly intelligent on every intelligence test I've ever taken (if you take stock in those), but I can't seem to figure myself out. I can never find any traction in my life, I feel like I'm just floating along. Everything feels completely hollow.   Instead of being creative, instead of building lifelong friendships, instead of getting in shape, or writing an album, or a book. I've spent the last 2 and 1/2 years depressed, drunk, and jerking myself off. I should be writing music, I should take account of myself more, I should just *feel* more, I shouldn't be as skinny as I am, I should be writing more articles as a journalist and getting my name out there, but I can't and I don't know whats wrong with me. I've seen therapists, but most of them have told me I'm almost too smart to treat. They tell me I know too much about their methods or too much about philosophy for them to treat me in the way they would normally treat someone and we never get much further than that. Great I have all this intelligence potential, but it doesn't do me any good.   I'm so afraid I'll spend all this time figuring it out and by the time I do all my opportunities will be behind me. I don't know what to do and I'm terrified.   (unedited)   Her friends aren't my main friend group, but they're people who I'm becoming friends with through other mutual friends and events pretty quickly. I just don't think she's going to let it go.   Eh I mean, I'm still feeling raw from the breakup. There was a lot of potential there and she was the one who couldn't discuss anything and then just gave up, so I'd be lying to say I wasn't angry with her.   I've tried to be friendly, but she just tries to avoid me when I'm around, so I've taken up the same policy. I'm also not actively trying to get involved with her friend group, it just so happens that we're often in the same places and get along pretty well.    I wouldn't be rude to them. I'm actually kind of confused about how they feel about the breakup. Most of them have just been very warm, and from talking to them it seems like they think I was a good thing for my ex.    We never really were friend before. It went pretty quickly from casually dating to having sex, and then soon after that a relationship, so there wasn't a pre-friendship.   Nah she split up with me. I thought we could have talked it out. I haven't been caring too much what she thinks since she dropped me pretty harshly. I just don't want to be overstepping my bounds, and her friend's and I are getting pretty chummy.   My ex-girlfriend split up with me a few weeks ago and since then I've been keeping myself as busy as possible. I was pretty hurt by the breakup, but I really realized that I didn't want to fall into a slump because of it. My ex had serious problems communicating, she couldn't differentiate between a serious conversation and an argument, so I feel like a lot of responsibility for the relationship ending falls on her. This has helped me move on faster than I have in the past.   I go to a small university where almost everyone knows everyone, or are in each other's social circles. Since the breakup I've been going out a lot, going to every party I get an invite to, and going to plenty of shows.   Hard part is, a lot of my ex's close friends, and their friends, go to my school, so we see each other all the time. My ex doesn't go to this school, so I go to a lot more of these social events than her. I was really awkward about seeing them in the first few weeks, but since then I've actually been hanging out them quite a bit when we end up at the same event. They're great people and I think we get a long really well, in some ways I think I get along better with my ex's friends than I ever did with her. The thing is sometimes she shows up at events and I don't know how to navigate that. Should I just back off when she's around or keep up being social and friendly? I really don't feel like talking with her much. She's a very judgmental person.   It's a tight social community, but should I keep up social contact with my ex's friends, even though I don't think either of us want the other one around right now? ---    **tl;dr**: Ex broke up with me. I go to a small school with most of her friends, and me and her friends end up at a lot of the same events. My ex doesn't go to my school, but she's around since her friends go there. I like socializing with her friends, but I don't really want to be around her. What do you think can I do to manage this situation?   It's a dystopian future for a lot more people than just the Nazis. Not saying everything about how culture has changed is bad, but there are a lot of things about the globalist society that are dystopian.    Your dad sounds a lot like mine. He's an engineer who's great at his job, but emotional stuff just gets by him. As soon as I get on the phone with him, he'll talk about work for hours using technical details there's no way he could possibly expect me to understand. I think he's gotten better over the years, but with everything other than work in his life he's a bit absent-minded. I don't know if he's as awkward as your dad, but mine definitely has hi moments. I was having flashbacks during the whole time I was reading your post.   All that being said, I know he loves my entire family, and he'll always do his best to be there for us.    I'm trying to avoid Canada Goose, just because it's what every other person wears here. I don't really want to stand out, but I've never really liked big labels on my clothing.   I'm looking for a parka that can keep out the cold. I've seen plenty of people recommending fishails, but I'm going to need something that can really keep the wet cold out. My upper limit for price is $500. Can you give me some suggestions?   This is completely anecdotal. I'm an arts major and top of most of my classes. I've never met a STEM student who wasn't struggling to keep their head above the water in arts courses. Both of my parents are successful mechanical engineers running large projects, and all my life they've told my brothers and I never to become engineers. From what I've learned from them and the people they work with, most people who go into engineering either go into it because they didn't have enough security to take something else, or they have poor social skills and are more happy looking at designs and blueprints than dealing with people.     Actually really interesting you mentioned Boards of Canada with reflector. I've been getting a BOC vibe from the second half of Reflektor. Awful Sound has a that guitar part you mentioned, some of the textures in It's Never Over, the chimey synth sounds in the chorus of Porno, and the last 6 minutes or so of Supersymmetry. I'd say Arcade Fire have definitely listened to some BOC.   There are people from all over the world that share that list of qualities. I think what you just described is largely how humans behave when they don't think about what they're doing. Unfortunately it's easier for most people anywhere to not think. Making wide definitive statements that you only have personal experience to support is ignorant.    Yeah it's pretty much just exam time that I have a problem with, time management isn't too bad other then that.   I'm coming up to exams for university, and I have absolutely no time to get to the gym. two hours out of my day would throw off my schedule and make it difficult for me to complete the work I have to do for school. What can I do to help me manage exercise while I just don't have time for the next few weeks?   I don't have trouble speaking so much when I'm nervous about a certain thing but when I have a lot of background anxiety. The days where I feel like I'm on high alert all day for no reason I sound like I have a speech impediment. I stutter, mumble, and speak quieter than I normally do. I'll mix up my words or take a long time to find the word I was looking for.    Yea, I know what you're talking about. I definitely get that "click of a switch" feeling.   It's not that there aren't people around who like you, it's that there aren't many people who think the same way as you. I don't think many people think about weighty subjects like; existence, religion and political ideologies that often.  I know that I think about those things a lot. So much so that it's almost as though I have a huge part of me that few people see. It's like there's a side of me that I hold back from most people, because they aren't interested in seeing it or are unable to engage it. Lately, I've been noticing how few people have serious opinions or have ideas that are important to them, and it makes me feel very detached. I can be in a crowd of people who like me, and have a great time with them talking about superficial things, but when I think about how much I internalize it makes me feel alone.    I don't have aspergers or adhd, but the symptoms caused by PTSD are very similar to those diagnoses. My parents weren't abusive, (though my mother could be emotionally I suppose) but they are serious professional types and were very emotionally neglectful. My family moved around a lot and I was left with a series of unstable babysitters, and was bullied severely by other kids.   I started dissociating and dealing with that by just distracting myself with hobbies and pop culture. I had really deep knowledge in things like history and literature from a young age because I used those things to occupy myself from strong emotions and dissociation. These interests might have looked like "autistic interests", but they weren't, they were some mix of stress and being above average intelligence. I had anger problems and seriously over reacted to things through my preteen/early teen years, which definitly could have been mistaken for the "meltdowns" people with aspergers have.   I had problems with concentration, but that was probably a mix of dissociation and stress. Blank stares and not being able to identify your own emotions are common symptoms for PTSD and Aspergers.   All these things made it difficult for me to build relationships with other kids growing up. Not being in touch with my own emotions, dissociation, poor self-image, chronic escapism, anxiety and depression are all things I have to deal with because of my PTSD.     It really helps hide how much oatmeal there is in a smoothie. I usually put oatmeal and milk in the blender first, then I put a banana in and blend those three together, and once that's almost pureed I put in mix fruits and sometime some peanut butter.      Yeah I agree with this one, I just super blend 300g into 2 smoothies everyday. I've done 2 cups of oatmeal in one smoothie, I just had to let it soak in milk for a few minutes before blending.   Nuclear weapons. My brain just can't process that there actually exists weapons that can level cities and kill millions in the blink of an eye. We have the capability to ruin the whole planet if we wanted to, and I don't think we're capable of comprehending that.    I don't think men and women can be friends in the same way that they can with the same sex. I think sexuality really does get in the way of simply being friends with people of the opposite sex and similar sexual orientation. If people are single there's always the "why am I not having sex with _____?" or "Why would ______ have sex with ____ but not me?" More often then not someone develops feelings for the other person and then it's not really a "friendship" anymore and more  a relationship of unrequited feelings. I think having sex with friends really changes the relationship and usually messes it up.     	30
 I was 12 years old, never did drugs, but I encountered a very malicious presence in my grandmother's house.    It wasn't something I could see, but no matter how much I tried to convince myself I was just crazy and there wasn't actually anything there, the presence felt like pure evil and *made* my body react in such a way that I became filled with terror and flight.  My rational mind was literally just like what the ever loving fuck is going on?    I've heard of people who have a certain instinct that tells them something is wrong when they can't actually discern what it is, and this was just one of those times.  My body and instincts were telling me to *get the fuck away* from whatever was there, except that it was blocking the only doorway out of the kitchen.  Nothing happened, but it felt like it wanted to kill me.  It irrationally made me fear for my safety in a certain way.  The part that really cemented the idea of it being a demon of some sort instead of a panic attack, was that the feeling of apprehension and fear within me *didn't gradually wear off.  Its exit was as instantaneous as it had come*.  I didn't realize just how heavy the atmosphere had felt until 'it' left.  The room then felt so light again, and I was filled with relief.  I imagine the whole ordeal probably would have looked like I was insane to an outsider; I was crying and praying to god and trying to melt into the back counter.  It was both the strangest and scariest thing that has ever happened to me in my life.    The experience itself *did* happen to me.  The part that nobody would believe is that it was a demon.  I can't tell you with fact that it was a demon, but I can tell you that it felt like there was a malicious presence there, and I personally associate the idea of a 'malicious presence' with a demon.  I guess it could have been some kind of temporary, one time, vivid emotional hallucination.  I don't know.  I don't go chasing after ghosts and the supernatural.  Nothing like that has ever happened again, thankfully.     YOU BOYS LIKE MEXICO? **YOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO**   I felt like Gates to Infinity pandered either to children or casual gamers.  I hated how I couldn't take multiple missions in one dungeon like in the previous games, *I mean why the fuck not?*  It made gathering materials a slow and painful process.  Plus they literally just made it waaaaaay too easy to get rich and get good items in that game.  I agree the storyline was too short and not as compelling as the previous games.  They better not skimp out on this new game that's coming out, I will be so pissed.     [This item.](http://items.jellyneo.net/?go=itemshowitem=7108)  The item description totally brings it together.  xD   I changed all the passwords and pins of my side accounts and main to completely separate ones for now, and I've deleted all traces of linking to my side accounts on my main just in case.  I've also checked the plain text neomail and login birthday prompt in site preferences.  I haven't talked to anyone on the boards lately and haven't neomailed anyone, and have bought a limited amount of items from user shops (a little risky, but I still need to complete quests).  And deleted cookies.  So far, my accounts are okay...  But I hate being careful like this  x_x  EDIT:  By the way... why is this happening *now*?  I get when it happened while neopets was still a relatively popular site, but I would not expect such tomfoolery to occur when the site is dying.  It seems to have come out of nowhere... unless it is a result of people realizing after the neopocalypse that they can do whatever the fuck they want?  _;   Oh yeah, *black liquorice*, another candy I hate  :P   I'm glad too, I really thought I was weird and alone on this.  :'D   My hope is that I can apply my imagination into creative outlets.  I can imagine things so vividly, but when it comes to actually writing, that is where I am perfectionist.  I'm a very good writer, just not with creative writing.  Creative writing involves exploring life in a realistic aspect.  I can't just make all my characters perfect like I can in my head, because that isn't good writing lol.  Being a good writer allows me to see how much I suck at writing creatively.     Hey man, my imagination falls along the same lines!  My favorite fantasies involve saving the day and rescuing my imaginary friends with my mysterious superpowers.  Well, I will admit I find this childish of myself, but only because I am so self-critical.  But you can at least have the comfort of knowing you aren't alone in this aspect.  c:     Do you think it's because our daydreams are like an idealized version of reality?  For me, it's a place where I am far stronger than I really am; that's the most important part.  I find myself looking toward society with a certain degree of apprehension.  I notice a lot of conflict and discord.. so being able to retreat within myself provides a sort of safe covering from society and a sort of buffer from my social anxiety.    I look at myself in reality and am disappointed with the person I have become.  The person in my daydreams has lots of friends but minus the conflict... but they're also super idealized versions of people, people that just can't exist.  Wishing for things that can't exist is quite exhausting, I agree.  I want to be willing to accept reality, but it seems very far off right now.  	10
 Want to fight about it?   I just shave my own head. It's cheap and it can look really good. Thanks man :)   Thanks bro. Yeah a friend painted them for my birthday right before she passed away. That was a few years ago but they remind me of her everyday :)   Man that brought years to my eyes. It's been so fucking hard and I've missed so much school but I am very smart (Not trying to brag sorry) and I finished with very good grades. This summer I am so fucking hyped for, I'm going to Denmark and I'm going to meet one of my best friends for the first time. I've only started taking Sertralin. I think this summer will either make me, or break me.   Thank you for the kind words. I will hopefully do better during the summer with medication.    Not saying it's even close to dying but it can hurt.    That was stupidly hillarious.   Noone has said anything about that they should die.   Do you think postning pictures of yourself, posing with your dead child is a good way to deal with loss? BS, I don't belive you.     This guy is high as a kite.    I DAG R JAG STARK!   Yeah I understand what you mean, but money will sure as hell makes it easier to do what you want in life. The quote says "Life is unfair to everyone" and I don't think it means that unfair to everyone = everyones unhappy, I meant that unfair = not being able to do things some rich people can do. Idk if that makes much sense(?) O.o   Well it's not really a good quote since there are people born into poverty and people born rich. I would like it too if it was true.   Welcome       Behold!

He doesn't know anything about pets and neither do I, so I asked my mother. I asked if you need to sign any papers or show id when purchasing a guinepig or anything like that. The first thing she does is scream "WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO WITH A RAT ARE YOU GOING TO TOURTURE IT?!"  .   You can really feel the trust in the air amiright.   You should really check with the flightcompany since every company has diffrent policies about animals onboard    SWEDEN YES!   Herregud jag kommer ihg det!

Ok so you are saying that people that have abusive parents should celebrate them for failing horribly at being a parent, rolemodel and guardian? Not sure I see the logic in that.  Everyone does not have good realationships with their parents.   Det r vll en skmt video? Ser inget pinsamt med att bjuda p sigsjlv.    What did it say??

 Revs   Solo revs is an experience in and of itself. Just do it.    Try to think of your diagnosis like diabetes. :) I find it easier to brush of peoples ignorance that way, because I wouldn't feel ashamed or upset if someone tried to make me feel bad for having a broken leg or something, just laugh at them for being an idiot. At the end of the day, your brain is an organ and can get unwell just like any other.    Thank you for that. I think the hardest thing has been, after having the diagnosis explained to me and what the symptoms are, I had this epiphany-type moment where I went back through all the shit that has gone on in my life and, with the revelation of this disorder, realizing that every single episode was caused by me and me alone. My entire understanding of my past and my friendships has been completely flipped, and it makes me sick to think of the things I have done to people because I thought they deserved it, how I pushed people away and yet expected them to come back and save me. I'm so deathly afraid of the road ahead. Its bittersweet in a sense because for once in my entire life I have an understanding of the chaos that is inside me, but at the moment I can't see it changing or getting better (even though, logically, I know it can).    I'm a 20 y/o guy that has struggled with episodes of rage and depression my entire life. I was diagnosed with major depressive disorder in 2011 and have been treated on the basis of that up until today. A few days ago I had my first major depressive/suicidal episode in almost two years and was admitted into a psych hospital after much convincing by my doctor (I could feel myself sliding into a depression so I decided to see my doctor to get a referral to a psychiatrist). After speaking with some of the doctors here they are confident that I have BPD. I never even knew what it was. After reading up on the symptoms, every single thing is applicable to me. Intense mood swings, splitting, issues in my friendships and relationships, impulsive behaviour, self destructiveness and suicidal thoughts etc etc.  I've been reading up on BPD and I feel so so much worse. I always knew there was something really wrong with me, and I thought it was Bipolar - I WISH it was bipolar because at least it is treatable. It feels like a death sentence. I cannot see myself ever finding love or holding down a meaningful friendship (my life is a long, smoking trail of destroyed and failed attempts to connect with people). I feel lost and upset and confused. I don't want this. Where do I go from here. FUCK   The issue is that she is practically living here and not paying rent. I do like her as a person, I consider her a friend, which is why the situation is so difficult/complicated because I want to resolve this without damaging the friendship. I probably should have mentioned this before but she was actually living here before I moved in. She was living here with Roommate B until they split up, and I took over her lease. They got back together after a few weeks which is when this all started. Putting her on the lease is not an option because of a few things:   - the apartment is simply not big enough for four people (its a two bedroom apartment, and the room that I'm in isn't really a room)  - there is only three car spaces, with no other place to park within 3km (she currently parks in the visitor spot when she comes over, which residents aren't allowed to do)  - the landlord would not allow her back on the lease anyway, because she handled leaving so poorly last time (she basically just up and left and stopped paying rent - it was just luck that I happened to be moving around the same time because I was looking at other places before Roommate A asked me to take over the lease)  Having said all that though, myself and roommate A have discussed asking her to pay a share of the utilities bill when it comes next, based on her being here literally every weekend and having showers etc.    That's the plan at the moment - I'm just finding it difficult because my options for getting away from the situation are minimal. I've moved interstate to a city where I have no friends or family. Short of eating out   sitting in coffee shops all day   night I have no other options, I can't go anywhere else except home. And most of these issues arise when I'm trying to sleep.    As stated in the OP, I have brought all of these issues up with both himself and the girlfriend on numerous occasions, and have always gone about it in a polite way and going in with a plan on what I wanted to say and a solution to fix the issue. The problem is fixed for a while, then it slowly seeps back in over a week or so before going right back to how it was previously.    **TL;DR: My roommate has no respect for myself or the apartment, does not make any effort to keep the place clean or contribute to the household in any way. His girlfriend (who does not live with us) is at the apartment basically 24/7 and does not respect the boundaries of myself or my other roommate. There is constant drama in the household, and despite my best efforts to tame the situation, nothing is changing   it is affecting my work performance and getting me down. I don't know where to go from here.**  I moved in with roommate A   roommate B in February earlier this year. Roommate A is great - I have been friends with him for over 10 years, and we rarely have issues between us when it comes to household stuff. Roommate B (who I had only briefly met once before I moved in) on the other hand is an absolute fucking nightmare.  So there are a lot of issues at play here; Roommate B  - Never cleans up/washes his dirty dishes  - Never contributes to shared items for the household (toilet paper, cleaning products, milk etc.)  - Refuses to do stuff like take out the rubbish  - Has a total disregard for the noise he makes when other people are sleeping (Roommate A   myself both do shift work and generally work weekends while Roommate B has a day job and weekends off, so he's always having people over for drinks   coming home late over the weekend and just being as loud as fucking possible)  These are some of the more minor grievances, which are sort of a non-issue because of one thing - his girlfriend. His girlfriend will come over and do his washing, cleaning, cooking, and buy his share of the household shared items (they have a joint bank account). But that is also sort of the problem here.  Roommate B's girlfriend is over every single day of the week - from the afternoon when Roommate B finishes work (~4pm) until late into the evening (10-11pm). As I said above, she'll come over   cook for him, clean up all his mess, do his washing and pack his lunch for work the next day. The only reason she goes home is because myself and Roommate A sat down with them and told them that she could no longer sleep in the apartment during the week (after she had slept there for 15 consecutive days). So now it just feels like they're taking the piss. She is here as often as possible during the week without actually sleeping over, so technically following the agreement we had made with them, and then she is here from Friday afternoon until late Sunday evening (and will stay on a Monday if there is a public holiday because 'its apart of the weekend').   This has been a constant issue in the household, and myself and Roommate A are constantly having to address it. The issue isn't really so much even the time she spends here, its the way she treats the apartment   the fact that she comes here not as a guest, but to basically live in the apartment (without paying rent or utilities). Further issues with Roommate B's girlfriend;  - She does her washing here (not all of it, but regularly enough to be noticed)  - She has her own bath towel   hook in the bathroom  - She frequently refers to the apartment as 'home' or 'our place'  - She will invite her friends to the apartment without letting any of us know (has brought them over for dinner)  And just yesterday she walked through our front door unannounced, with a friend, while Roommate B was not home (he had given her his key to get in).  So all this stuff is going on on a regular basis, just constantly building up my frustration at the situation and both Roommate B   his girlfriend's total lack of respect for myself and Roommate A, and then on TOP of this, every single weekend (or close enough to not make a difference) they will go out for a drink, come home and have these loud, melodramatic arguments that go on for MINIMUM two hours. This is not just bickering, its huge episodes where she's screaming and crying and threatening to leave him forever. If he hasn't cheated on her, he's spent too much of her money or he's taken drugs again. This is of course followed by them making up and having ridiculously loud sex. I haven't been living here all that long but I have already lost count of the amount of times I have had to go into work with NO sleep because of this shit.   This honestly sounds like an episode of some stupid TV show and I legitimately feel like I'm trapped in the big brother house. I have voiced my concerns numerous times to the both of them on all of the above issues, and they say all the right stuff and it gets better for about a week, and then quickly descends right back into where it was.  I just want to be able to feel comfortable and safe in my own apartment. I want to be able to sleep   have my roommate respect my space and the apartment. I am on the lease until January and I am at a complete loss of what to do here.   Infuse it with apricot and make a Charlie Chaplin. Mmmmm   I've actually just been asked to write the cocktail list for my bar, with heavy suggestions on certain alcohol so they can move some old stock.   45ml fireball cinnamon whiskey, 15ml frangelico, 30ml thickened cream. Shake, strain, awesome.   It's also in Australia, where almost everything is significantly more expensive. $20 an hour is really not that much here.    Did you not see the part where he tried to use the terminal and it shutdown/locked itself?    Nothing like a cheeky nandos after some banter with the lads, ay bruv?   Jesus Christ please do not encourage the use of bisexual as a stepping stone to coming out as gay.    If the screen turns on, its not bricked. You can just flash it with ODIN.    Check out the Melbourne bartender exchange on Facebook. You're not likely to find work here. (Also, there is a shit tonne of places hiring in the cbd and northern suburbs at the moment. Just print out a bunch of resumes and drop them in person)   Heavy liquor licensing laws prevent such a place from existing. You will be back on the streets by 4am, so no partying til sunrise unless its in an apartment (or at the casino, but let's not go there). Swingin safari has a pretty cool vibe though (depending on what you're taking - I'm assuming MDMA) but I don't even know if its still open.    Melbourne. Its entirely possible to go out Friday night and not stop partying until Monday morning. Look up revolver Melbourne Sunday morning on YouTube.    I get what you're saying but its now been two days since it happened and I haven't heard from her. I would have given the benefit of the doubt if she had reached out and apologized for her behavior, given that she was under the influence and no actual harm came of it, but she clearly does not have an issue with her behavior and that says enough for me.    100% certain. Only thing I'd taken was the pills (and a handful of drinks) and while I had started to have some auditory hallucinations by the time I got to my apartment, I seriously doubt I hallucinated coherent sentences.    Definitely did not help the situation haha.    Yeah I guess you're right. I think I'll just stop making the effort to contact her, but if she apologizes on her own I would just let it go (but still never be in a situation with drugs and her again). We were all definitely still under the influence, but she was also lucid enough to know exactly what she was doing.    I was the one spending the money on the drugs. Maybe that was it...   I'm a guy, and the other two people were another guy and another girl.    Haha you got me. "Let's go to revs." Was said more than once.   Last Friday night I met up with a friend and a couple of her friends that I had not seen for a few months - after a few drinks we ended up getting our hands on some ecstasy and took a few pills each. These were the strongest ones I'd ever done and I ended up on a completely new level - it was fun and awesome, we basically just hung out at a bar until they closed at 7am. By the time we got outside I had started to come down, and after getting a bite to eat I started having mild hallucinations (likely due to sleep deprivation) and decided to go home. Up until this point the night had gone fantastically, but my friend and the other guy we were with instantly turned nasty as they wanted to keep going (there is a club where I live that is open 24 hours Fri-Mon and is generally filled with people that don't want the good times to end). They started taking advantage of the fact that I was coming down (both physically and mentally) and were trying to scare/guilt me into staying. I have only just moved to town so I didn't really know where we were, and they refused to give me directions to the nearest train station and even actively tried to make me confused/lost - I tried to get my bearings by walking the direction I thought we had come and they followed me, laughed at me and told me I was going the wrong direction. I was becoming extremely upset and just wanted them to leave me alone but kept my cool and did not give them the reaction they wanted - just pretended like that weren't doing it and gave them both hugs and thanked them for a good night when I finally got on a tram home (thanks to my phone).  Why do people do this? I have no issue with going on multiple-day benders but when someone decides they're done, why on earth would you try to make them feel like shit for making that decision? Because I was coming down extremely hard it really rattled me and I ended up in tears on the tram. It has truly affected the way I view this person (after being decent friends with them for 3 years) and I probably won't socialize with her ever again.   So many people on this sub misunderstand this. The reason they make those unnecessary modifications isn't because it enhances the experience, its so that when you hand your mum your HTC or Moto device to take a photo, they look at it and go "oh I don't know how to use this, I have a Samsung.". It creates brand loyalty because people go with what's familiar.    It explicitly says that it is unlikely to work on modified ROMs (eg cm)   The reason this rule usually exists is because some people have tattoos that are distasteful or inappropriate for the workplace, and so instead of having to make a judgement call per tattoo (and thereby inviting the possibility of outrage and drama from an employee that is upset because they have to cover their tattoo but another employee doesn't) they just have a blanket policy.    Guess we're all different after all. :) OP did say they were into pubs over clubs though, so that's what I recommended (club Liv is awful). Take it from a 19 year old who goes out quite literally every night.    Surfers is tragic compared to the nightlife of almost every other major city in Australia, so don't expect much. That being said, fiddlers green and the avenue are usually pretty enjoyable any night of the week. If you're down for a boogy I'd hit up Bourbon Bar - pretty much the only club in Cavill that's worth the entrance fee. Beer garden is always good fun too.    Yes, you can do this by shrinking the existing partition to whatever you desire (the minimum being the amount of data currently on it, so 400gb) using Partition Wizard in windows or gparted (from a live linux disc). You can then create an additional partition to install OS X to.   Just FYI, it's recommended for beginners to install OS X on two separate hard drives as installing them on the same harddrive can cause issues that may be difficult to solve for someone that has never hackintoshed before. The OS X installer will refuse to install on a drive that does not have a GPT partition table (windows machines typically have MBR) and you will need to patch your installer to allow you to do so.   How do you feel about paying taxes?    If we're taking this to a realistic level, each month there'd be a performance rating and if you don't reach a certain rating (or have too many customer complaints) your mandatory employment is extended an additional month, until you complete every month with satisfactory effort.       Make sure you don't have NO PLS RECOVERY installed.    When I was suicidal I used to write letters to the few people I thought I owed an explanation to if I were to actually commit suicide. By the time I finished each letter, the feeling would pass and I would promise myself that I would sleep on it and if I still felt like doing it tomorrow, I would. Each time I would wake up the next day feeling really silly and dumb and continue on. I kept each letter that I wrote in a book. I wrote about 10 in all, and then a day came where I realised there was nobody else I felt I should write a letter to - which means I no longer had something to distract me from the suicidal compulsions I had. I left the letters on my bed and stood outside my parents bedroom door for about an hour, hoping that they would somehow be able to sense that I desperately needed help. They didn't, so I got in my car and drove to a stretch of road that I often travelled to clear my head, which I had never seen any other cars on at night. I closed my eyes and just put my foot down and let go of the wheel, ended up going off the road and rolling a couple of times before crashing into a tree.  What went through my mind? Nothing. Not to take away from what other commenters have posted here, but I have noticed a lot of people are posting about having a rough night and thinking about suicide. When you really make the decision to end your life, you don't think about anything. You have considered every single option and to your (irrational) brain, suicide isn't just the best option, it is the *only* option. An overwhelming sense of calm and clarity overtook me. My mind was blank.   I walked away from that car with a couple of stitches in my head and back (crawling through the shattered windshield) and a broken finger. To say I was incredibly lucky was an understatement.   Depression is no joke. If you think someone you know might be struggling, PLEASE do something. The thing that made it the most difficult for me is that I had reached out to people and nobody really took me seriously. My parents wrote off my behaviour changes and general deterioration of my mental state to being a teenager. Please, don't ignore shit like this. Suicide is a fucking horrible thing.    I installed it without issue, so I'm not sure what YouHawk's problem is, but I have no idea how to check if it actually deleted afc2.   It's viewed by many in the jb scene as insecure.    iLex RAT and restore will essentially restore your device without losing your jailbreak (using the restore option). Regardless, while Apple is still signing 8.1 and 8.1.1, just restore to whatever iOS version you want and rejailbreak.    Boot into safe mode by holding volume up while booting (disables all tweaks). From there you can either try to uninstall tweaks one by one (you'll have to reboot each time to get out of safe mode and see if the tweak was at fault) or you can make a backup and do a fresh restore.    Your best bet is to uninstall any tweaks you've installed in the last 24 hours since you started having issues (you can do this in safe mode). Respringing in safe mode just goes back to safe mode again, which is why your tweaks aren't showing up. You have to reboot, and if you're sill getting a black screen then there is still a problem tweak. Possibly try installing ilex rat while in safe mode and use that to remove all your tweaks.    Make a backup through iTunes of the old one and restore that backup on the new one. Done.    According to ipsw.me (which is updated every 60 seconds) 8.1 is still being signed.    You need to follow a guide, Google around for a bit and read one. At the first Yosemite selection screen, type "-v" without the quotes and hit enter. Your mouse isn't supposed to be responsive at this point, what you're seeing is the bootloader, which only responds to keyboard input.    I think I may just be the worst here: Smirnoff vodka, Jim beam, Gordon's gin, cuervo tequila, bundy rum, Johnny red   Bacardi. $8 for a 1oz pour.    Niresh has a lot of tweaks and changes to the system compared to a vanilla install (moreso than any other hackintosh) so doing a direct update to 10.10 would be a bad idea and you'd probably lose your working install. Its recommended to do a fresh install to update between major releases anyway.   Anyone know if I can take advantage of this deal in Australia?   What's your point?   I know they have been transparent. I don't actually have any problem with them doing it. My point is, if you do your banking on an operating system that WILL send your bank account login info over the net, you are extremely naive. Not even your bank knows your password. All it takes is a disgruntled Microsoft employee.    Why on earth is this guy being downvoted? It's absolutely true. If are using Windows 10 as your main/only OS right now you are retarded.    You come back to that area later in the game and you have a new tool to get through.    Graphics enabler is a hack to use unsupported graphics cards on osx. Osx supports the HD 7xxx series natively as of mavericks. Leave it off.    I think "less intelligent" is a bit of a stretch. Building a pc is an enthusiast/hobbyist thing to do. A person is not "less intelligent" because they choose to channel their time and energy elsewhere.    The "charm" you're talking about is called nostalgia, dude. The current gen (and every future gen, likely) still provides that same "charm" for the 10 year old that gets a COD Xbox One bundle for Christmas.   "It used to be so much better pre console x" aka when you were a kid. What a stupid comment, of course its going to seem better/cooler/more "charming".    You can uninstall the motioninjoy software once you've got the drivers up and running and just use better ds3 exclusively. That's what I did and it works like a charm.    Why not just exclude connections made to certain IP addresses/websites? How are you catching the data usage in the first place?   I think that might be your problem - I'm fairly sure virtualbox requires you have at least 8gb of RAM to host a 64bit OS for performance reasons. Have you tried installing the 32bit version instead? Your computer might handle that better.    Are you on the latest version of virtualbox? You have to choose 64bit from the drop down list of OS options. http://imgur.com/uHIzuZk   Virtualbox definitely supports 64bit and has for a long time.    You can't post a link and text at the same time, just FYI.    I think this is more in terms of if it gets taken to court.    Its a graphics issue. The GUI is loaded just after that Bluetooth message (the Bluetooth message isn't stopping the boot, your GUI just isn't loading afterwards). Try graphicsenabler=no   Omniroms split screen is pretty slick.    Try myhack   Why on earth would you make a comment like this in the nexus 4 subreddit?   That's just luck and coincidence. Osx WILL work on a lot of hardware but just because it has happened to work for your devices does not mean it will work without fail every single time. Still incorrect.    This isn't accurate, at all. Certain hardware parts will simply not work with OSX, no matter what modifications are made. If OPs friend has intentions of installing OSX on his PC he should make sure it is as compatible as possible before purchasing it, otherwise he's not going to have a great time.    Unlocking the bootloader   rooting makes it significantly easier to perform an unauthorized SIM unlock.    Lol, didn't OP post this theme on /g/ and everyone there said it sucked? (Not saying that I was one of them - I think it looks great)   At the chameleon bootloader (black background with grey text that has a countdown - this screen appears before the grey apple logo) type in "-v -x" (without the quotes) and hit enter.    A somewhat easier solution is to install Niresh in a VM and then create the USB installer through that way (saves you screwing around with partitions and reboots) - and IMO myHack is easier to use and has slightly more features than Unibeast. Great guide though! Also I'm pretty sure everything you put after the -v flag is redundant: -x is safe mode and implements all those flags itself anyway.   Given that 8.1 is a free update to 8 I can't see why your 8 key wouldn't work, but I haven't personally tried it myself so I can't say for sure, sorry.   Those programs are for updating an existing Windows installation (e.g. Windows 7 - 8), and cannot be used for a clean install. For a clean install, I'd suggest downloading the Windows 8.1 .iso that corresponds to the version you currently have from [here](http://forums.mydigitallife.info/threads/53564-murphy78-s-Windows-8-1-Server-2012r2-with-Update-MSDN-iso-files), then making a bootable USB installer from it using [rufus](http://rufus.akeo.ie/) and then doing a clean install by booting from the USB (and backing up any important data beforehand).   Where would I find USB kexts? I have already searched for motherboard and chipset kexts for my hardware, as well as USB. I know I need something I just don't know what the correct term is. :(   I'm having issues getting my Wifi USB adapter to work. I previously installed Mavericks on my PC via Niresh 10.9 and after seeing how well it worked I decided to create a clean install USB and reinstall OSX (Niresh comes with a lot of extra kexts and random apps and I wouldn't really feel comfortable doing anything that requires me to put in a password on it).  The USB adapter I have uses a 8191s Realtek chipset, and on the Niresh installation all I had to do with download the Mac drivers from Realtek's website (used the ML drivers as they were the latest one). No issues there, all up and running perfectly.  Now, with the clean install, after installing the drivers and wireless utility app that comes with them (using the exact same install package that previously worked on 10.9) and then restarting (as per the installation instructions), the Wireless Utility app refuses to start. I open the app and I can see the icon appear briefly in the dock before immediately disappearing again.  Things that I have tried:  * Installing different/older versions of the driver (tried every driver available from realtek)  * Tried modified drivers from macbreaker forums  * Manually installing the kexts that are contained in the installer.pkg  All with multiple reboots - no dice. Still the same issue.  One thing that does stick out to me, on the Niresh install, when viewing USB devices in System Report, it listed the USB as RTL8181S Wi-Fi Adaptor, whereas with the clean 10.9.4 install it is simply listed as Miscellaneous USB device - which makes me think its an issue with a missing or unmodified kext that had already come with Niresh and I have yet to install; only thing is, I have no clue how to figure out what I'm missing. Is it a motherboard issue?  Any pointers would be great!   Yeah it will work fine, just did this myself actually. If you install osxfuse and ntfs-3g on OSX you can read/write to the NTFS partition too. I just set up all my libraries on Windows and home folder on Mac to point to that partition, so now I share photos/videos/documents/downloads folders across OSes. Works pretty well.   How is this the highest upvoted comment here but it doesn't have a single source to back it up?   My friends mum gave her some for a birthday present and she uses them because she doesn't want to make her mother feel bad that she's not using her gift. They're not all bad :(   Did you wipe /data and /system before flashing again? If it booted the first time you flashed it, there is literally no reason for it not to boot again on a clean flash.    I'd love one!   Its a fresh install, and has been an issue the whole time (even before I managed to get it to boot to desktop). I don't see how reinstalling could fix it.    So I just recently got my hackintosh build up and running, everything works (except for some sound issues that I'm dealing with, but I am confident in my Google-fu for those) but I am having the most bizarre issue: every time I boot into OSX, my CD drive ejects itself (at the apple logo)? And when I get to the desktop I get a popup stating that I have inserted a blank disk (and asking me what to do with it). I have an Asus B75 Pro3-M as my motherboard, if that's relevant.  edit: in case anyone with the same issue comes across this in the future, updating to 10.9.4 fixed the cd tray issue.     Uh because the reason people get there early is to prep for the day - prep that will screw you over later in the shift (at rush times) if it isn't done. The time spent serving is wasted prep time. I run bars at weddings and if I stop prep to serve the few early birds then I'm running around trying to get stock (beer, fruit, clean glasses etc) during the rush, making me lose more money than if I had just ignored the few early birds.    Hello Melbourne-dwelling redditors! I have plans to move to Melbourne (from the Gold Coast) in January and wanted to get some advice on a few things:  1. **Housing**: Firstly, I need somewhere to stay. I intend for the move to be permanent, so I am looking for something long term, and was leaning towards a house share with a couple of other roommates (so I don't get lonely). My question is this: I would really love to have living arrangements sorted before I head down there, but a lot of people I have spoken to have advised against making a commitment to a place that I haven't seen in person, as people will often post misleading photos on the internet and places are generally a lot less favourable when you actually get there. I'm also a bit worried about getting scammed and sending a bond payment to a person for a house that doesn't even exist. How prevalent are these scammers in Melbourne? Is this something I should be looking out for? How realistic is it of me to expect to have living arrangements made before I go down there? Would I be better off staying in a hotel for a few weeks while I inspect houses? Would people be willing to agree to let me rent from them without even having met me first? I thought having a Skype call might mediate some of these issues - myself and the ad poster would get a feel for each other and then they could give me a sort of 'virtual tour' around the home. Also, how early should I start inquiring for accommodation? I have noticed a lot of the Gumtree ads are looking for people to move in ASAP, so I don't think they'd be willing to wait for me to come down in January - but I really don't want to be leaving it to the last minute.  2. **Work**: As well as living arrangements, I would also like to have a job strapped down for when I get there. Many of the same questions apply here; how likely would it be for an employer to hire me based on a phone/Skype interview? I would like to start working immediately when I get down there. I have approx. 1.5 years worth of hospitality experience, the last 4-5 months of that being in a senior supervisor role - how marketable is this experience? Are there a lot of hospitality jobs going down in Melbourne?  3. **Transport**: This I'm not too worried about, but thought I'd mention it just in case I'm being a little naive. I've been to Melbourne about 5 times in the last 2 years, so I have a fairly decent feel of the inner city suburbs and how the public transport works. However, I will be without a license until mid February, and without a car until I can afford one. How survivable is Melbourne without a car? Will I be able to rely entirely on public transport (I would like to avoid taxis at all costs, those things are killer expensive)? I have no family or friends down there, so I have nothing to fall back on (other than taxis...) if I get stuck somewhere there isn't public transport. I intend on buying a bicycle as soon as I get down there as well, and I am used to riding around to get myself from A to B.   When someone is having an anxiety attack its important to 'ground' them. Usually resting a hand on an arm or a shoulder and speaking to them calmly will be the most you can do. Generally the person suffering the anxiety attack just has to let it pass. Just let them know you're there. If you realize they're having a panic attack, tell them. "You're having a panic attack. You are not dying. It will pass soon. Try to steady your breathing." in the calmest voice possible.   HSCs are a standardized test that certain parts of Australia undertake at the end of highschool. It's what gets you into university. If you fail the HSC, no university will touch you and yes, there are other ways in but they can add another 1-2 years onto your study. It's a pretty big deal.    I stayed in Cambodia recently for just under a week and honestly, in comparison to home (Australia) there were virtually none. No flies either. I did stay in Siem reap though, so it might be different in the more rural areas.    Just for clarification: "driving" as specified by the law here (QLD: $330 fine for touching your phone) means your car is running, regardless of where you are. Just started your car in the parking lot and quickly checking a route on Google Maps? $330 fine. Hit 'next' on your music player at a stop light? $330 fine, and now you've lost your license. I understand the reason for the rules, I really do, but seriously, stupidest fucking thing ever. (I may or may not have first hand experience with this...)   Movie 43      [Higher quality](http://gfycat.com/IckyUnlinedAiredaleterrier)   Its from Movie 43. Essentially just a bunch of random skits. In this one, Emma stone plays a checkout chick at a grocery store and falls head over heels for a really gross looking customer. He's sweet talking her in this scene.    If it is actually him, it could be a trick of he lighting. The photo on the left has a flash directly pointed at him, causing shadows under his chin and jaw, making it more pronounced, while the second photo is lit from the right hand side, making his chin seem weaker.    [HTML5](http://gfycat.com/NegativeLegalJavalina)   [HTML5](http://gfycat.com/NegativeLegalJavalina)         I'm pretty sure hangouts is closed-source and Google doesn't provide any APIs for 3rd parties to hook in, so you're not likely to see a 3rd party with hangouts capability any time soon, if ever.   Son I'm too high for this   Fair enough. I just can't imagine being any level of upset/annoyed if this happened to me. I used to make graphic-intensive profile designs and coding (all original) for some anime forum site, and I had people messaging me about other members lifting my graphics and even code (with my comments still in it) and selling it for the in game currency - it never bothered me in the slightest, in fact I even remember feeling excited the first time it happened lol.   Not trying to be a dick here but... does it really matter? I'm not entirely sure why people on reddit get so upset about reposts. The entire idea of reddit is built upon linking to other websites, which can be considered "reposting". I get that it can take a significant amount of time to create a gif, especially high quality ones (I've just started doing it myself so I can appreciate the effort that goes into them), but unless the reposter is making real world $$$ from it, I don't see the issue.

 I guess just living in a small town with nothing to do makes everything worse. I don't have many friends, and when I actually need them as a support system they're all out of town :(  I hate waking up and having the same monotonous routine of laying in bed and moping in my room, but I dread interaction and having to get up.    Before I can remember, I've never really felt true joy. Depression runs in my family, and it was no suprise to my mom when I was diagnosed with it last year. Since then, I met my (now ex) boyfriend and for once I was extremely happy because he was patient and kind, but under certain circumstances he broke up with me. Since that day, I have reverted into my old lifestyle of laying in bed for days on end only getting up to use the bathroom. I don't find joy in my old hobbies, and I just spend my days sleeping, crying, or staring into space.   I have realized that this behavior needs to stop, I'm going to college in September and I need to learn to cope, but it's so hard when nothing except him make me happy.  How do I make the best out of my bleak life?      Thank you very much for the help. I will get on it on Monday!   Oh sorry! Its CP 32   It says CP   What confuses me is that it was a check from 2013, and I never requested for a new check to be sent, so I'm very confused   Today in the mail, I got a letter from the IRS stating that my request for my 2013 tax refund has been accepted and they are mailing me my check. The problem is, I already deposited my 2013 check and have proof with my bank statement. I had a job at an icecream store and quit last year, and since then I havent been working (I am now 18).   I tried calling the phone number but it was only an IRS automated number. Does this mean identity fraud? If so, what are my next options?      You can try an fail, but don't fail to try   Wow thanks!!    Thanks for the suggestion! I assumed it was leather because of the zipper in the front. I'll look into a zentai suit though   It apprears that Celty's suit is made from leather, but im looking for other alternatives. What would be the best material to make it out of?  I would also prefer a fabric that can be used on a regular sewing machine or a serger.   Selling an UNUSED [Chosungah22 lipstick in Orange Jello] (http://imgur.com/a/KQGG5) for $13 + free shipping   Thanks again, I just started cosplaying within the last year so it was a huge accomplishment    Thank you so much :D      Any possible dupes for this look? I want this palette so bad but I dont have the money :(   I dont know much about the jacket, but I have been making props and masks for a while. If you choose to modify the mask, BUY PRIMER! specifically for plastic (I would assume the mask would be plastic) and it comes in a spray paint can. Acrylic paint would work the best because its bright, but the downside is that it chips if you dont seal it.   Now if you want to make a mask, the quickest way would be to use worbla and shape your own mask. I would recommend using a foam head that they use for wigs as a form. Worbla can be expensive, and a little tricky to work with, but it looks very professional as a final product.    I love it when cosplayers really get into character    This by far is the best advice. Dont be afraid to give her space and let her cool down as well. The most important thing is to also be understanding, compassionate, and patient. There is not one true way to reach out to her and "cure" her anxiety, but as someone with GAD, the closest thing there is to a remedy is support.     Well its what they use for my sister at the time.    I posted this answer in another Ask Reddit thread, so here it is:  I'm 5 years older than my younger sister, and when she was born I could never really grasp the concept that she had severe mental retardation. My parents always said she was "special", but I was too young to understand. I grew up loving and caring for her and I doted on her. She was too mentally retarded to walk or talk, and only communicated by pulling hair.   Fast forward and at this point I'm now a middle schooler who is ashamed and embarrassed of her own sister. I refuse to let my friends come over and rarely ever talk about my sister even though she was the light of my life, I cared more about fitting in. I constantly used the word "retarded" even though it made me uncomfortable knowing thats what people would call my sister.   One day, the first time I brought a friend to my house to hang out, they saw my sister and called her a "disgusting retarded freak" and she started to cry. I was distraught at seeing her cry and being FULLY AWARE of peoples opinions and what they said about her. I kicked my friend out and hugged my sister for a full hour.   After that, I realized that my sister isn't something to be ashamed of. She's my best friend, and to this day she will always be the love and light of my life.    Monty Python and the Holy Grail. The killer rabbit scene gets me every time   I've got relatives in Boston who frequently send me their winter parkas, snow pants and snow shoes (not that I need them...) so the winter clothes is already taken care of. I was planning on taking public transportation at any school, and would probably just invest in a bike. Not an excuse to go up north, but I atleast have the winter gear covered.  As for fitting in, I guess I am also partially biased but I did one of those programs where you can "spend a night" at a university. I did that for MSU and really enjoyed it. Now my dad lives ~20 minutes from Chapel Hill, and he always like to take me there to hang out and explore, so I dont get much interaction PERSONALLY, but my close friends who attend CH all agree that they feel sort of "lost" at times because they can't quite find their niche.    Maybe I should generalize to just Asia, but in Japan there are many certifications to teach at international schools    does your dad expect you to live with him if you attend UNC?  See thats another issue. This will turn into a war between my parents. They both live equidistance from Chapel Hill and will do whatever it takes to get me to live with them, and they WILL NOT allow me to live on camps. I really want the whole "college experience"  and don't want to have to live in the middle of feuding parents    My boyfriend is still a junior in HS :) The *main* reason I dont want to go to CH is that I don't find myself fitting in. Yes, I know I'll find my "niche" but I generally dont like North Carolina at all. I just really want to leave for good, which is probably another reason why my dad is so adamant about picking Chapel Hill.   That makes sense. My dad went out of the country for college (Mexico to Boston) and he HATED that he couldn't come home. But I, on the other hand, feel more comfortable "out of the nest".  I will talk to him and ask him if visitation is what's going to bother him, and see what he says.    	28
 What has happened in your life that you can read the stories of child abuse victims and decide to write comments picking on their vocabulary?   I didn't say they are all victims of child abuse, I'm sure many are not, but its clear to see there are lots of people there who are. The whole 'Nmom' or 'Ndad' thing is used in all kinds of psych forums and support groups to highlight the abuser, I just found it strange you felt compelled to say you found that to be 'crap'. They need help and support not a slap in the face.     I also hate the whole "N" crap   You hate the short hand terminology used by victims of child abuse to discuss their experiences..? That's what you took from that sub? What the hell.  	3

But if someone asked you "Would you have sex with x y or z (your male friends)?" you would likely answer no (or correct me if I am wrong).  That makes it inherently a one-sided friendship. The man wants it to become sexual, but you do not. Friendships between men are two-sided; neither of them wants sex, since they're hetero. They simply enjoy each other's company and are not expecting anything more from the relationship. It is a more "pure" kind of relationship, since both parties are upfront about what they want from the other person - just friendship.   I'm an amazing friend to those who deserve it.  How modest.   Everyone's ganging up on you but you're entirely correct. Women do not need to be as funny or interesting as a whole, as men will seek them out regardless.

Simple question; I'm curious how many fellow Christians are here just like to joke about the mother-sub (which I stopped reading because it is pretty repetitive and full of junk). How many of you are non-believers, either ex-christian or otherwise?  Edit: to clarify for myself, I'm a typical grumbling anglican englishman who loves to complain on internet forums   Uh......no.   Cape Feare.  "Now, when I say Hello Mr. Thomson and step down on your foot, you smile and nod."  "Gotcha."  "HELLO MR. THOMSON." *steps on Homer's foot*  *Leans to other agent* "I think he's talking to you."     I think my generation is a bunch of pansies and complainers  Agree entirely.  Good lord, the amount of people my age (I am in my mid-20s) who complain about not being able to find a job is staggering. Take a shit job and suck it up until you build some experience. Holy shit, they're practically giving jobs away in Alberta right now (I am Canadian). I never see the Chinese, Indian or other foreign students/20-year-olds complaining about a shitty job at McDonalds. They recognize they got to do hard work and put up with shit; they're not pampered.   Well..let's go to the old mill anyway...get some mouse pads   He's saying "insolvent?!"   The yogurt is also cursed   ...care to expand on anything you said?    Here comes the shaq attack!   You got too much free time   BUT WHY   Hey...I took a look at some of their photos and videos...I am Christian and even think this is a bit cheesy, but their wrestling is actually pretty good for a niche indie circuit.   ...just kidding   I wish you luck, but maybe the reason more women aren't interested in you is because you sound incredibly generic. "Funny, nerdy, normal" is all we know about you. Funny and normal are essentially requirements for even friendships...try telling more positive, unique traits about yourself.  And I don't mean "I also like movies and music."   oh yeah!   hope somebody got fired for that blunder   Did you even read the OP?      The strong must protect the sweet...the sweet....   Carry on!   Take some drawing courses at a local community college, or even just buy a simple sketchbook, some pencils and find a nearby life drawing class....that's a good way to start anyway. If you want to get good, you need to practice everyday.   /r/truegaming ?   Learn to art   Learn how to code. Or learn how to art. Why the heck are you even worrying about choosing an engine without basic coding and/or art skills?   http://i.imgur.com/dgGvgKF.png   Digital Tutors is the best. The amount of stuff on there is insane; anything from 3D modeling to concept art.   Additionally, find a GOOD 3D modeler on YouTube and watch his/her other videos. I am in school and have access to Digital Tutors and other professional tutorial sites; about 2/3 of the "tutorials" on YouTube are absolute garbage in comparison but there are some good channels out there.  	107
 Stacked up on an office room shelf.   What station? I might have a better idea if I know the type of music the station plays. But would it be Jolina Carl "anymore"?   Friendly, and genuinely kind. Gets me every time. Active and has hobbies.   Yep still live with my parents. I'm from a small town and getting your own place is almost impossible. I also think it's cultural. I'm also a student so I live at home to qualify for student funding. I still have my own place when I'm at Uni but when the semester is out I'm back at my parents.   The Anthelios Lotion made me sweat more, the Cream was much better.   I watch other people's videos on YouTube mostly because I live in an area where I don't get to see the artists I would like.   Yes. But I've learned to invite people to concerts I think they'll enjoy. Eric Church and FGL? My brother. Don Williams or Charlie Pride? My dad. Keith Urban or Brad Paisley? My friend who plays guitar.  Carrie Underwood or Miranda Lambert? A female friend.   Most often they repay me by forcing me to go to concerts with them like Nicki Minaj or some metal show.   Classic country would be:  Hank Williams, Roger Miller, Kitty Wells and Patsy Cline.  Modern would be:  Kacey Musgraves, Kelsey Waldon, Lindi  Ortega and The Pistol Annie's (Ashley Monroe and Angaleena will also play their solo work). I would add First Aid Kit but I don't know if they would be country exactly.   Yeah I was thinking of putting the 3G network back on so on the off chance it's switched on I'll get a notification.  Edit: hopefully they didn't pull the SIM card?   Okay. Thanks. I doubt I'll ever get it back but was just curious.   My iPad mini 3 was stolen. I reported it stolen. Had the sim card suspended. I have Find My iPhone turned on and put it in Lost Mode. It has a lock screen. I have restrictions set so no one can make changes unless they know the password.  But since I found out it was stolen I've checked Find My iPhone and it's been offline. I've checked the notify me but so far, nothing. It's only been two days.  The thing is I'm not sure if they were able to restore it somehow. I usually customize the names of my devices but this iPad is just listed as 'iPad' which is odd. I might have forgotten to rename it when I reset everything a few months ago. I'm just wondering if there is any way possible they could have restored the iPad mini which could result in the name change and the offline status?   Randy Rogers and Wade Bowen, Hold My Beer Vol. 1  -Standards -El Dorado -Hanging out in Bars   Brandy Clark or Brandi Carlile.   Dixie Chicks -Wide Open Spaces -Fly -Home   There's a mashup of Linkin Parks Numb with Jay Zs encore.   Dirt. The only Florida Georgia Line song I own.   I like a lot of songs off their "You Get What You Give" album so I'd just recommend the entire album.   I'm not sure about a second cat now. I'm a student so I go "home" during the summer months. This was the traveling I was talking about. I'm not comfortable leaving my cat alone for weeks or months at a time even if I get someone to check on him.   Jake Owen - what we ain't got?   Kristen Stewart or Amber Heard would be at the top of my list.   It seems traveling will be an issue then. My cat is fine with traveling now and seems to know what to expect. But if cats in general are not fine with traveling then I can't predict if the second cat will get used to it as well.   I'm moving from a roommate situation to on my own.   I've already listened to it a few times through already. I love it! I think it's quickly becoming my favourite of the year along with Randy Rogers and Wade Bowens recent release. Same Trailer, Different Park was good but I found I tired of the music. It sounded all the same. This seems to have more variety to the tracks.   I wasn't too much of a Jason Isbell but the more I get past the quietness of his songs and listen to the lyrics the more I like his music.   I have a 2 year old cat and I'm thinking of getting a second cat. I think my cat is lonely when I'm not home, he seems to sulk whenever I leave. I think he could use a companion. But I'm wondering if it's the right decision.  Some things I'm concerned about:  - I travel every few months to visit family either by 16 hour road trip or by flying. Traveling with two cats is doable but does complicate things.  - I would be committing to another cat for his or her lifetime. Though a companion would be great for my cat, my cat doesn't have to worry about vet bills, moving, etc. - I'm moving from a 3 level townhouse to a 2 bedroom apartment in a few months - I'm starting College in the fall so the cats will be alone for a better part of the day, the pros are that my college will be across the street from my new apartment  Otherwise my cat isn't affectionate but does love humans and their presence as well as their attention. He's playful but not very creative.   I was just about to post this link after finding it but you beat me to it. :)   Oh, Tonight  	26
 This isn't funny at all, in anyway, you sir are sick.   It be better for everyone I know if I did.   The update hasn't released, the beta-testing period of the update has been opened to super jimmys, there's quite a big difference.   You know all the unfair things that happen to people that they die? Like car crashes and fires and muggings? I'd take one of those so someone else didn't have to. I think that would be the best for everyone.   Sometimes I think that hole though will be for the better, that all I do is hurt.  I affect things, but not positively.  It would be for the better.   I have gone to a mental institution for 8 days, and I can say without a doubt that they were the worst days of my life. I actually fear my home phone ringtone because I'm afraid they're going to take me back.  I wouldn't be here if I had nothing to lose. I'd be gone, but I'm afraid of failing and going back to a place I feel was worse than hell. I'm here, talking to all of you because I want so badly to just have something happen to me, but couldn't do it to myself.  I don't know what to do.   It's not the best option though, not from what people say. The best option is to end my suffering and everyone's qualms with me. It's not fair to anyone for me to know how painful I am but still inflict myself on others.  The best option would for me to just never have existed in the first place.   Anything I say or do is wrong. People get angry at what I say and do in general and I don't know what I do is wrong, just that it as a whole is, I yet don't understand. I've just accepted my entire existence is the problem, and most people agree.  It's just that though, I'm lazy, or selfish, or something but I just can't help people, but feel like shit that I can't. I've pretty much determined the best way to help people is to not exist at all in my case.   I care about others yet can't do anything for them but bring anger and frustration. The only way for me to seriously help people is to get rid of the problem I am.   Doing my part consists of being out of everyone's and everythings lives.  I have honestly tried to change myself but it turns out the same, the pain and anger generator I am. It doesn't change the bad I do.   Alone in how I am? No.  But alone in people that care about me? Yes, even I don't care about me.  I just want people to have the best, but I don't do anything good for people and if I didnt exist it would honestly make the world better off. I fit in nowhere and ruin everything.  I'm not fit to be around people, they deserve this punishment.   I don't. I don't fit in yet I'm not interesting. I honestly just make people mad and I'm terrible to talk to. I can't do anything for people but I want everyone to have the best from me, and the only real way to do that is to not exist. I couldn't care less about myself, I just want others to be better off.   The person I most looked to in the world has told me they're better off without me, as most people do when they speak to me over time. I don't fit into the world, I don't have a place, and I just make people angry and hate me. I'd make the world better by simply not existing. What am I supposed to do, make people suffer my presence? It doesn't seem right.   Before I got a fan to put under it, my skin would actually blister and melt to my laptop, so that was always fun.   It doesn't seem to matter if I admit and regret it, people still end up always hating me.   No, but who I am is pretty indicative of who I'll be later in life, someone completely hated by anyone he talks to even for short amounts of time. And to me, that tears me apart.   Search for what though? What is there even to search for? I could never be truly happy knowing all I do is cause pain for people.   I've poster here before about all the bad things I am and feel. And I still believe them. But I had one person I thought I could trust and talk to and they betrayed me too when I was at my weakest. I'm broken and hurt and feel like I don't have a place in the world. What am I supposed to do.   You do know there was an "official release" of the Gym, which was coined as season 1 by Rob? Just something of note.   Well that's just what I name it character lore wise, but yes, two :p      Well thank you! I learned how to write really from one specific class, up until then I didn't really know and I'm much better off for it.  The best thing to do is practice though! And thank you again!   Nice to have more map makers put their own lore on the wiki, I hope mine was okay until you did your own.   I had thought it was the elves that were thriving, but could be wrong.   May I ask, why the unsatisfaction?   I awoke with a jerk.  Today was the day, the day I would finally get to ask Lord Willakers my question. He was returning today after going to H'cet to assess the damage the elves had inflicted.  Long ago, Lord Willakers ruled over an area within a land called Dong Dank; a place filled with dwarves that acted like all sorts of races, but the pure would reside in the Dwarven District, which he ruled. However, ages ago this place fell into disarray, with warring factions and accidental destruction plaguing the land, Willakers set out for a new homeland for his dwarves.  In his travels, he came upon what we now call a shrine. Hidden deep within the Chocolate Mountains, it had a sort of allure to it, a glow and a power that made him feel stronger and more agile. Finding no adverse effects, he would return to Dong Dank and would make an announcement: all the dwarves that wanted to live in general peace, come with him.  Most of Dwarven District did, with a few from the other districts coming as well. They would build a stone keep in those mountains, centered around the shrine they now praised. This is where I am now; Mount Willakers.  I sprung from my spot on the floor to my feet and put on my boots. We don't have much for commodities here but I was able to fasten myself a pair after collecting bits of leather for weeks. I headed outside the great entrance and looked out into the field. Around the entrance we had a wall, and past that, a camp filled with makeshift tents and campfires. You would think we hadn't been here long, but in fact, we've been here ages.  My great-great-great-etc. grandfather came here from the Dwarven District, and I was raised here in Mount Willakers. Our infatuation with the shrines seemed to halt all other progression of our construction, and so we've lived in a camp of tents for centuries. Being one of the original dwarven families however, I was able to sleep inside, which was a treat, as the weather we've been having recently was rather dreary.  Out into the distance I saw the source of our blight in recent times, as storm so black we thought it may have been bugs instead of clouds. It had been swirling for weeks and stayed just to the edge of the field, by the hills at the front. I walked over and found myself a chair, it wouldn't be long before Willakers arrived.  Slowly a crowd would build by the outskirts of the field, awaiting his arrival. Many dwarves adored the Old Man, and while I could say I did, at the same time I was not infatuated with him. He was a dwarf, same as us all, more powerful yes, but just dwarf all the same. After a few hours, I finally spotted him, coming over the hills with his companions; Nisovin, another Lord of Dong Dank, but also the last known Gnome of his time, and Roamin, a rank 11 paladin that was a descendant of the Lord of Brickton.  A path formed between the dwarves for them. Fearing the Old Man's death stare, they knew they had to step out of the way, or be made to. I stayed where I was, I was in no rush, as Willakers would of course remember that it was my turn for a question, an inquiry, and that I would not have to bother him with such petty reminders.  But he didn't, he walked by with his group of gawkers and proceeded to the entrance.  "Well, maybe he did just forget, he is rather busy." I muttered to myself, grudgingly.   I walked up behind him as he observed the group of dwarves around him, and tapped him on the shoulder.  "YOUNG DWARF, YOU DARE TOUCH ME." He bellowed, with genuine anger in his voice.  "Well, Mr. Willakers, it's just..." I said, trailing off.  "JUST WHAT, WHAT COULD BE SO IMPORTANT YOU TOUCH ME?" He yelled, louder this time.  "Well, today is my question day, and you just, wandered by, is all." I said to him, half shaking.  "Oh, I see, I'll be right with you, sit back over there." He pointed at the seat I had been in.  I put my head down and walked back, sat and observed him. He dismissed his two companions and talked to a few dwarves before he walked over to me, and pulled over a chair.  He sat down and produced a flask of juice from his pocket, swigging it and then putting it back.  "H'cet survived, barely. They've begun to rebuild and this time, will better protect their shrine."   I stayed quiet. It did intrigue me, these other shrines. Long after Mount Willakers was founded, other dwarves would venture out and discover more, and under the Old Man's guide, would build more keeps around them to protect them from any attacking force. H'cet was one of these, a smaller one, but extremely fortified as it sat right at the edge of Elf land.  "Well, I suppose I should get going quickly, so, what is your question?" He asked, before preparing to stand up.  "Yes sir, of course, well I wanted to know if...."   BOOM. A lightning strike from the storm beyond, but not just a normal weather occurrence, this was blinding, even for the Old Man. After my eyes readjusted, I gazed out and saw a new anomaly in the sky.   A dark cloud? No, it looked, like a ship.   "Dear God, I knew this day would come." Willakers said under his breath.  "We have until nightfall. GET THE WEAPONS READY, FORGE ARMOR, BUILD A WALL, WE NEED THIS PLACE READY FOR WAR, NOW." He screamed out, so that all dwarves could hear.  I was dumbfounded, I had never seen such a structure before and nor had many of the other dwarves, but I did as the Old Man said. I found myself a juice, a runeblade, and a shortbow, and got to work. I was given armor and fletched arrows until nightfall.  We all stood at the edge of the massive forward wall we erected, stretching halfway across the field.  Beside me, another dwarf would remark "I feel kinda sick.", with a few others around making moans and one falling over.  All of a sudden, my comrade fell flat, and then, within seconds, would spring back up, with his flesh falling from his face and armor shedding off, he began to run at me, maw wide open.  Practicing long ago with a sword and bow, I knew the basics of their function but not much else. I swung wildly at him, successfully pushing him back so he could not bite me, and instead ran after another dwarf. After some time, these "zombie" dwarves would drop dead, and dissolve into the ground.  But this wasn't the worst, floods of monsters, ranging from zombies to wolverines were springing from the ship and decending upon the land. We would do our best to defend against them, shooting and swinging at whatever wasn't dwarf. Many of our men began to realize that our blades and shovels had magical properties, that they could roll and "proc" monsters in quick succession after killing one. Using this to our advantage, we would push back the monsters many times to their ship, but when night fell, they pushed back. Hard.  We would be driven back to the inner wall, then the inside entrance, and eventually we found ourselves in the halls, tandem sword fighting and proccing anything that moved. We could hold, but not forever, and eventually we were pushed into the shrine room itself.  The shrine's light, while empowering us, was beginning to dim, as more and more monsters piled in, until finally, it gave way, and after a thunderous BOOM. I found myself without weapons or armor, and suffered a quick death.  Or did I?  I then woke up, found myself on the floor of Mount Willakers once more, with Willakers shouting at the men to armor up and build a wall to defend against the zombie hordes.  "Oh no, not again." I said, with a sigh.  It's endless.   **Weapon:** Orion  A "silver" sword that does 15 attack damage and blinds mobs, making them slowed. The glint of the blade is was blinds them, its very bright. This sword is weilded by the Deathseeker, a dwarf with immense power, as he is the only one that can use it.  **Weapon:** Brenna  Its mine. A bow that has such a graceful "twang" when she fires, she pierces the hearts of mobs with double damage, and a spurt of fire erupts around the mob for a second.   Praise be the ranger god.   Brenna got stuck in a time loop in Oasis for me until we moved realities, hooray wierd timelines!   Did he snipe from afar?   I went on the DvZ server lobby for 10 seconds and in that time you talked in chat 5 times and had 2 people tell you off.   You are literally as dense as lead.   I can say with certainty that it doesn't really bother any DvZ players and that /u/awesomeshafter in no way represents any sort of opinion DvZers have.  We honestly don't like him.   /unjerk  Can you not? He has an opinion, good or not, you don't have to burn him at the stake.  Edit: and I meant that referring to producing an IP, people should never assume anonymity, even if they are entitled to it  /jerk  BURN HIM WITH TORCH   He means it sounds like a previous map's name, if you would like to see the names of old maps, look [here](http://dwarves-vs-zombies.wikia.com/wiki/Maps)   When I played UHC often, I adored beast, it brought a smile to my face when I saw him in game, when he messaged me. I thought he was an awesome guy, its terrible to see him gone. RIP good buddy   When I played UHC a lot, I adored beast, he was always kind and funny. I'm so sorry for your loss, RIP   Don't forget the screams. The screams...   Nostalgia does not always need to be the best maps, nostalgia can also come from maps like Erebor and Bellows and Molgan too, just to add.   Back when he still existed, Pause was the most fun to me, one simple weapon that suits my playstyle, was cool :p. Bruce now, just because Roamin is too easy and bland and I don't like nisovins abilities, just personal preference.   It used to be 7 on the gym, that's probably where that came from.   No, its not, its spelled YetiiWho92  Edit: ah, my apologies, reflexes   /u/trollabot test_subject5099   Is there something wrong with asking for art if people offer it? I love the art I get!

I submitted that, I have not asked her if she wants to play, as it slipped my mind last night, but I submitted it with my name on the off chance she did. If she doesn't, its not like she can't be removed later.  Edit: Also, if at any point someone freaks out she comes on, she won't play, so keep that in mind.   This sir, makes me happy, I love it! Thank you  ^ ^    Very impressive sir, I like it :p, thank you :D   Just me and a friend :p   Thank you :P   Bellows didn't have armor tables, so yes, we did start with armor like that.

 To keep it short, my wife (35F) and I (33M) just got done with a talk about where our failing marriage is headed and if it's something that we want to fight for (I know I want us to work out, but her answer to every question I ask is, "I don't know").  She just left the house without telling me where she was going. I texted her and she replied, "Wow! Last time I checked I was a grown adult!". Is it wrong of me to want to know...just in case something happens to her? I still care and worry about her.  **tl;dr** I'd like to know where she's going at 11:30 at night.   Not good enough apparently.  She told me recently that she doesn't love me anymore.      If we get a divorce...is one of those boobs mine?   Now that I think about it...I do have a sweater with a hole in it, but it's not covered in grease. :(   Bought her new boobs to make her feel better about herself.   The last of my exes is now working behind the Wal-Mart deli counter, and my wife is a 1st grade teacher.      Trade up.   I have to check the lock on the back door of my house multiple times before I go to bed.  I can see that it is locked, because I am the one who locked it earlier...but I still have to touch it and reassure myself that it is locked at least twice before I feel ok to go upstairs.

 Just a lurker here and completely inexperienced with drugs other than marijuana,  but this is the funniest damn thing I've read all day.   Sup folks.  I'm in the market for a drip tip.  I'm looking for something glass, long (longer the better), and widebore.  I know not where all you guys get your funky drip tips, so any assistance is appreciated.   This gif is as goddamn old as time itself   Remember all the this is Sparta remixes? This is older than that.  Hell, this is older than runescape.   Older than albinoblacksheep.   Older than ebaumsworld.   This might just have been the first image to ever be broadcasted on the Internet.    Congrats, man! Super jealous!   Vape as in hardware, or liquid?    Vape Dojo, eh? Nice to see you still around here.   I have a question for you. Last night I found myself having a full body craving for Zen Juice - the first Eliquid I've ever had.   The question is, do I buy all the Zen juice you've ever created, or no?   Edit: I just bought a lot of Zen Juice anyway.   Oh yeah. Imagine during a 7 hour workday, only having 15 minutes to get nicotine in, and having to struggle with 3mg Eliquid in the shistey fogger.    You digging Cowboy Cooler? I was thinking about placing an order. Not sure if I should get fruity freeze as well, as I loved that in my last order.    Check my ninja edit on my previous comment - that may help him out a bit.    yes the horror stories are strong in this subreddit.   In my eyes, it's still a really, really great device. While I've stopped recommending it to others as I don't feel comfortable giving them something they'd have to fix, I'm confident in my ability to do so. I don't regret the purchase at all and I don't want to return it. I really enjoy this device.   However if I had to do it over, I'd plug up the screw on the top of the device closest to the firing button, and I'd insulate the space between the sliding plastic window and the black iStick enclosure - either saran wrapping it to keep liquid out or something else creative.    Yes.    Generally, I believe the taste of a dry hit is produced by acrolein.    A user on here seems to think it's about a T6 if that helps.  However, I had your same exact problem. If you need a vape right away and don't have the Torx, here's a couple of workarounds that got me through.   This isn't going to sound serious, but in all reality, I banged it onto my leather steering wheel a few times right below the button to try to force the button mechanism out. Worked fantastically.   Another thing that worked was unscrewing the atomizer, screwing another one one, and screwing back in the old one.   However when you get the Torx drivers, check out this fix I posted today.  http://www.reddit.com/r/electronic_cigarette/comments/39ytol/how_i_stopped_my_istick_50w_from_autofiring/   Thanks Totes      Did you take her apart?   Sure could!   The only time I wouldn't present a chemical to a vape is if I believed it were to have the chance of heating up and me inhaling the fumes. However I'm sure that isn't really a hot spot.    hell if you really wanted to, you could put some saran wrap under the center sliding plastic window and out over the walls it slides into, and then cut off the excess.    http://i.ytimg.com/vi/xANkTK2jxgU/0.jpg    Aeolus  I've never heard of it, however it sounds close enough to areola that i'd want to buy it. I'll check her out. Hopefully she's sick as tits.  Edit: holy $85   Besides this fix, which I believe is likely to increase your life expectancy tremendously, you can turn your iStick off whenever you are not using it, and if you want to be even safer, remove your atomizer during long periods of non-use.   Well, if I see a bunch of Hawaiians dancing my way, I'll now know whats up.   I have a feeling that if they didn't already have a picture of me on a wall to throw darts at, then they definitely do now.    You're not ignorant at all :). However I have seen just a small few people talk about their 30w's autofiring. I've seen way more 50w posts, however. The 50w was also the hottest product on the market at the time, so that could also account for the difference in amount of posts.  I wouldn't stress about it. When the iSticks started autofiring, people really, *really* lost their cool very fast.  When I saw the issue, I just kept doing what I was doing - turn your iStick off when you're not using it. In addition to that, I started sometimes taking off the atomizer if I was going to leave it sit in my hot car during work. That way there is nothing for the iStick to fire.  I had an autofiring iStick, yet I still made use of it for a week, since I really wasn't feeling my mech mod setup. As long as you just unscrew the atomizer as it's autofiring, you're still in control of the device.   I don't know much about the VT60! What I can recommend doing to learn a bit about it is to punch it into the search engine for /r/electronic_cigarette. Try punching in VT60 autofire, or various other google-fu terms.   Your bravery will inspire redditors for many reddits to come.    Holy shit, dude. I have no clue.  The only thing I could think of is melted glue - as none of that is supposed to bend. The chip is stuck to the batteries and the batteries are stuck flat to the chip. That's some f'd up gore, though, man.  While mine didn't autofire past the 10 second limiter (so far that I've seen), I have seen some that have. Maybe it's possible that this thing fired all night, and the batteries got so hot that it just melted shit up?  If you wanted to check whether or not it was actually the batteries that were an issue, you'd have to peel back or cut through the insulation on both terminals of the battery so that you could put the leads of a multimeter on there. If the battery were to be around 0 volts, that *could* be the reason it won't take a charge, as 18650's won't charge after they stoop down to a certain voltage. However it could also be a faulty chip in that situation. However if the batteries were to be around 3-4v, you know that you've got a chip issue.  I'd ask /r/openpv. I'm not by any sense a master of electronics. I just happened to find a fix for one of the many issues with this device :\.   Interesting. I've tried to wrap my mind around induction, but still can't seem to. I've seen a company that makes induction vaporizers for eliquid, oils, or flowers. Interesting stuff.   This is a thought provoking idea.  How would you charge it? You couldn't just really wrap the sides, you'd need a full enclosure.  I once saw a tablet on the front page that had a battery vent overnight and the tablet actually burst, showing a full charging bag looking thing. It was pretty interesting.   I think the issue is that when a battery vents, it lets off so much gas. You'd need that material to have a lot of space to move or it will burst   cause an explosion. I have a charging bag, and it is made to still release gas, but just not flame.   A battery was... leaking?  Usually if 18650's are punctured in any sort of way that will result in flames. What does the leaking look like? Is there any sort of corrosion?   Of course.  It is mainly due to [this issue I had with them.](http://www.reddit.com/r/electronic_cigarette/comments/2m5km4/horrible_customer_experience_with_eciggity/)  It is also due to the issues felt by many of those who participated in their Black Friday sale. Many orders were charged upwards of 8 times, totaling over $1000. Here's [one case](http://www.reddit.com/r/electronic_cigarette/comments/2nowen/eciggity_ruined_my_weekend/), [another](http://www.reddit.com/r/electronic_cigarette/comments/2o6yo1/eciggity_charges_have_finalized_no_refund/), [another](http://www.reddit.com/r/electronic_cigarette/comments/2o28ww/anyone_got_any_money_back_from_eciggity_yet/), and [another](http://www.reddit.com/r/electronic_cigarette/comments/2p4952/continue_to_be_disappointed_with_eciggity/)  It's also because I feel that they participate in vote manipulation on reddit, both on comments made by their official account and on posts relative to their company.   Thank you sir! This is exactly the comment I was waiting for!   Yeah, totally relevant. I haven't had any luck finding other people taking apart the 50w, so I'm glad to have read it.  If it shits out on me again, I'll be sure to update the post!  Thanks for your comments, m8   I've worked on a buddy's Lemo Drop. It's a pretty decent product! Thanks for the recommendation.   I didn't have the veritas long enough to determine whether or not it was a product I loved - I just know that it never leaked on me and that's my biggest priority.  I've always just brushed off the hardness of building (which is why I own a fogger, the hardest thing in the world to build). However I would like something easier to build, which is why I'm totally into the idea of the Marquis.  However I never had to build my dual coils with only one wire on there! I was able to use two. I can dig up a picture of my build if you're interested.  Edit: I stumbled across my only build image. It's not too helpful anyways, but I still love the color of that 'Nana Cream. http://i.imgur.com/EAEdSlU.jpg   Thanks m8  I aim to be the hero ECR needs, but sadly I am not the hero ECR deserves.  ;D  Edit: http://imgur.com/8At2BP2   I was going to reply to this comment but I see you have it covered completely. This is a super strange issue. Sadly a bit of rubbing alcohol might not fix your buttons being in the same circuit.   This is super interesting. Thank you for posting this here.  It's very possible that this might not be a forever fix. While jiggling around the button - it does seem to be a piece of shit. However he does attribute humidity to being a possible cause for the button not working - and this should solve the humidity/wetness problem. I still think that the reason the button sticks inside is due to eliquid getting in there.  It was a fix for me, but there is a whole variety of issues some people have with the 50w that this sadly might not fix.   Thank you for this. Sadly, I won't be doing any business with Eciggity.   Great point.   Everything I get leaks. I got an infinite CLT v2. It leaks. My friend borrowed me his new plume veil. It leaks and sucks. I went back to my old fogger. It leaks and dry hits (amazing combination to have from an atomizer). I'm currently building coils for the CLT. I want a marquis or a veritas to stop the leaking, I just haven't found any good ones.    Best of luck! Let me know if you have any further issues or questions.   The fix was successful. Check 'er out.  http://www.reddit.com/r/electronic_cigarette/comments/39ytol/how_i_stopped_my_istick_50w_from_autofiring/   [Here 'tis, mane.](http://www.reddit.com/r/electronic_cigarette/comments/39ytol/how_i_stopped_my_istick_50w_from_autofiring/)   What's up ECR.  I know we had a pretty long period of everyone's homes being destroyed by iStick 50ws. I was confident that my home would remain safe, however my iStick 50w too fell victim to autofiring.   However I didn't toss her, as I'm poor and cheap - I instead decided to take her apart, have some looks, and see if I could locate a problem. I did this about 2-3 weeks ago, and waited to see if any problem has returned, and I'm happy to say that I have had no further issues at all.  The issues I were having with the iStick 50w came on very suddenly. I was getting high one day, and the dog knocked over my iStick and it leaked liquid all up onto itself, and upon grabbing it a while later, I noticed the firing button would not work. I could adjust the wattage, but I could not fire the device or turn it off.  I later found out that this was because the firing button was stuck on. As I drove into work the next morning, the device actually began to autofire in my hand. I just unscrewed the atomizer, used a buddies vape for the day, and used the device on/off for about a week before deciding to do something about it - as there are no other products on the market that I'm really interested in right now.  So here's a little treat for all of those who didn't throw out their iSticks instantaneously :) - hopefully it'll stop your house from burning down.  Here's a shoutout to /u/ddo405 who tracked me down a few days ago looking to see if my fix was successful. It took me a little bit, as work has been hectic, but I put something together for ya.      Absolutely. I used to sing road man all the time as a kid, and now after recently rediscovering the album, I drive around to the tune.   I also now smoke up to the song Stoned quite frequently, but hey.    Titles can change? What did the title use to be?    I'm still listening to astro lounge to this day :)    #[OH YEAH] ( http://digitalonq.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/kool-aid-man.jpg)    [climbs down the urethra] ( http://ak-hdl.buzzfed.com/static/2014-06/12/19/enhanced/webdr08/anigif_enhanced-4054-1402614053-1.gif)    I'm obsessed with [Let It Happen by Tame Impala]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kyic0eOWH7o feature=youtube_gdata_player)   right now.   The song drags on for a bit in the middle but the dynamic changes toward the end. After 5:00 is my favorite part :)    Yeah. That's fucked up alright.    [This is how we trip.]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKqV_ybCS-I feature=youtube_gdata_player)   I sure was! The fix was simple and mine hasn't had issues in a couple weeks. All you need is the small torques screw driver to open the case ,some rubbing alcohol, and some cotton. I'm currently in a tree right now but I'll put together a photo album when I get home.    This could ^(be interesting^I ^wonder ^if)    I'm pretty bummed out. I haven't been in a strong relationship for quite a while. I sadly can't even remember when it was, as I got heavy into benzodiazepines toward the last half of our ~14 month relationship, and I really wiped out a lot of my memory for that ~6 month period. I got cheated on, again, by a beautiful woman I was living with. I think its been maybe 2 years since then, but I haven't been able to commit to anyone since.  I'm trying to get back into the game. There was a girl this semester in college I was obsessed with, but it didn't take off. My old friend with benefits who I haven't seen in quite some time said she wanted to get down on Wednesday and I got so fucking excited, and then she called it off. Two nights ago I just got the number of this adorable girl I work with, and we had a date set up for tomorrow, and just now she canceled.   It's like, I just want a partner to be by my side. I've been diagnosed major depressive with a side of a severe anxiety disorder. In the end of 2013 I went through the hospital system, and early 2014 I did months of therapy, but since the end of 2014/beginning of 2015 I've been really trying to climb above it and feel normal, and mostly succeeding at doing so. I've been working out, getting out, doing fun things, but in these last months its like nobody around me is down for the count. I really struggle to find people to do things with anymore. Although I was there to support all of them at their lowest, none of them turn around to just spend some time - so I'm stuck at home with my depression, getting high and/or drinking, when I'm not bold enough to go out and try to have fun solo.  When I was in that committed relationship, with that partner, we'd do everything together - spend every moment with each other, and never tire of each other. I'd have someone to talk to on long hikes, someone to go cruise beautiful roads and hang around lakes with to just watch the damn sunset and feel alive - but lately I feel that I've got none of that. I get my hopes up so much when I get the slightest indication that things are really starting to look up - that someone is taking an interest in me and I might get a new friend or special someone, but I feel like I keep getting let down again and again. I don't know what it is, but it's got me sad.   Check out this fix if you're interested in trying to prevent the short and fire yourself.   http://m.imgur.com/a/xv9aq  https://www.reddit.com/r/SmogGB/comments/39d9a7/ipv4_balance_board_removal_if_anyone_cares_lol/   I had a similar thing happen to me this semester at college. There was a girl that I was super obsessed with. I tried to move my way closer to her slowly, and I think we decently hit it off, however the opportunity to get her number never really presented itself. I gave up on it, thought about it and she didn't seem right for me anyways. Luckily I've just met a girl through work , and have already started texting her back and forth :).   In my freshman year of high school, I dated my best friends sister. While me and that friend are still great friends, I can not recommend the dating of the sister.    #Beer is good!   Best of luck!   Congratulations on becoming one step closer to healing. Learning more about yourself is always a great step to make.  The hospital can be a frightening environment, but it is also where I learned some of the most important things I'll ever learn in my lifetime. Don't expect yourself to be fixed as soon as you leave the hospital, but do realize that you will have the tools to much better deal with the problems you encounter in life - and that really makes all the difference.   RIP?     Oh no, why RIP?   Back to the 90's recently.  [Smash Mouth - Waste](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cRvxVBxQ_8) and [Fallen Horses](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F0sdzCdMBe4)  [Sugar Ray - Someday](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQSCKWfJlXs)  And also lots of Tame Impala, like [Music to Walk Home By](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4Kb8wF_EFU).   I got a really cute girl's number last night, and woke up to a text from her this morning :).   It's been quite a while since I've been in a serious relationship - but hopefully maybe I'm on my way towards another one!   Oh, hey! That makes sense then. I didn't realize you were installing a larger 510 connection.   Why not insulate the short? Just put some of that yellowish battery insulating tape between the 510   the balancing board?   Thanks for providing a fix to the community!    Even if you don't make the news, it's pretty common (I've worked at two different banks) for all employees (I worked as a teller and a desk job behind the scenes) to receive email alerts of robberies with pictures from the camera after any Robbery in the area happens, no matter if it's within the company or not.   You also need to make sure that you don't know anyone who works for a bank. I've personally exposed one person.    False. A bank Robbery commonly sends an immediate report to all banks in the area, because it is now extremely common for robbers to rob a chain of banks in one area instead of just one per day.    Sounds like you almost got sick as tits, man.    Still want this. I will be buying, however it'd be excellent to go through Smog.    Well, she lives in a trailer. She ripped off the condom, and her vaj smells like fish. Her mother begged me to impregnate her. Her stepfather is an Outlaw 1%er and her mother is property of the Outlaws.   Looks like my life would be the worst it could possibly be, had we gotten married.    Fuck. I forgot to press.    Try not to cheap out too much. This is the one thing you don't want to skimp out on.    Having a variable sensitivity would make sense in this situation.    POWERTHIRST   That fucking username   Died    I have really had my eye on this thing the last few weeks as I saw it posted on vaperoyalty. I absolutely love the look of it, the 50w range, and the temp control.    ask   Bananas   I don't even have to click the link and I know what this is.

This was very interesting to watch before passing out last night.    Nice, dude! I guess the price is right!    Oh hell yeah!    I don't care if this is a reference, this is one of the greatest things I've read on reddit. Sounds like Dwight Schrute.    Sex.    Wow, man. That's really incredible.      Just trying to wrap my mind around this.    Do the graphics emulate the feeling of a certain type of drug? Like, what should I be tripping on while in watching this (real American spirit in particular) to enjoy it to the best of my ability?    Great stuff man.

I've been really worried as to what would happen to the business due to the outright crazy laws passing in your state. I'm really glad to hear that you're choosing to relocate and continue business! I'll be placing an order soon!    I don't understand how he reached age 20 in a matter of 16 months    I want to hear him narrate tripping on LSD. I'd watch for hours.    This is an excellent explanation of the subreddit /r/todayilearned, where nobody learns anything because every post links to a Wikipedia page where the idea being examined has no reputable sources.    Pretty smart, actually.    Same, man. Someone's gotta shut down that website. That's such bull shit.    Jet fuel?    You ever lose someone that matters to you?    Agreed.

I jammed out to this while making peanut butter Ritz cracker sandwiches.     I really felt that saxophone.    It changes all the time! I'm into anything but country, but I have to admit that I dabble the most in electronic music. Dubstep is really my best friend (excision shambhala mixes) when I'm having a really controlled energetic mind late night high. Right now I'm spacing out to the metahuman album by eprom.   Aside from tame impala, other great vibe artists have to be Rebelution for sure, pink floyd is always a given, and I've recently dropped back into Smash mouth ( sugar ray  everclear) as well -  more specifically their astro lounge album I had as a kid.   Aside from that,  regular everyday music would range from Cake's Satan Is My Motor album, psychostick, tech n9ne,mac Lethal, Eminems old stuff, big chocolate (trap-ish music), Green day, and blink 182,     No problemo   I don't believe it to be any more dangerous. I don't know that I'd smoke straight hash, usually mix it with flower or vaporize in the form of dabs of hash wax.    No fucking way man! Even the same album.   http://imgur.com/0bWapMq  Tame impala is the only way to have it.   Discovered this video just as I picked up smoking again, and I still can't stop watching it and listening. Was my first tame impala song. Now I've got all of them on repeat daily.    Dude yes. I was watching Billy Madison and but changed to adult swim before smoking up. I really regret it right now.   also it's normal to not be able to form sentences.    Goddamn glad you got gold for this.    I really third this. Always been interested in high CBD strains. Recently tried hemp CBD Eliquid, but would enjoy something more natural.    Best of luck with your battle against gravity.   	110
 This is my tumblr: http://dale-art.tumblr.com/ This is my instagram:_cdale This is my twitter: @cassy_dale I'll follow you on tumblr, but it won't be my art blog, because that's a secondary blog.       Man, I plan on moving to SLC, Utah, once I having the funds. I'm a freelance artist, but since I'm not getting any work, I'm gonna have to a get a "real" job. Hearing what you said really worries me. Do you think, if I ever get a job interview, that I should lie, if I'm subtly asked about my religion and say I'm Mormon?    For me, it's all of the different sounds. For example, the droid that answers the door to Jaba's Palace, it just sounds cool! I love that different droids sorta have their own indistinguishable languages. It makes some of them sound gritty and depth to their worlds. Another sound I enjoy is when a big ship, like a cruiser, is heavily under attack, or very badly damaged, they make that sorta "arooga" sound(I hope that makes sense. That's what I hear, at least). Lastly. hearing the range of emotion in R2's beeps.  I love it!       Thank you so much, I appreciate it.   I love the movie "Her". I think Scarlett was perfect for that role. Her voice is just so captivating to me.       I have very terrible anxiety issues. I honestly don't think I could handle taking a bus or riding a train, as pathetic as that sounds. That's a main reason why I'm trying to hard to get my own vehicle.    Thank you! I appreciate it!    Thank you so much!   	11

 Tried both hard killing and clearing cache. I would like to be able to set the clock to 10 seconds for some exercises like the L-sit. I'm a total newbie and still use the lowest reps and seconds for each exercise. Values higher then 15 seconds works fine. Thanks again! :)   I have a problem after the update. Towards the end of my workout today my clock got "stuck" at 00:15. I cant change the seconds to anything else than :15 if I don't also add at least a minute. I can change the settings but as soon as i click "ok" the clock goes back to 00:15. It worked just fine when I started the workout. Maybe I'm the only one with this problem? Love the app! Thank you!    I have to keep reminding myself that even if I don't reach my goals as planned it's okay. I will get there eventually. Goals are fun and motivating and they should stay that way. Don't let them mess with your head. Soon you will reach your one year anniversary a much healthier person than before. Take a moment to celebrate your accomplishments and then keep on going for round two.    I would really love a Alana shirt.    Did my first episode today. Had three zombie chases and the first two was uphill. Really got me working harder than before. ;)   Thank you!    This is actually my first time with C25k but I used a similar program years ago when I first started running. I never stopped thinking about it either. Feels so right now. Congrats on your comeback too!    I'm starting Zombies, run! this sunday. My first goal is to have fun with that for some time. Then I will be working on both distance and speed. My longest run ever was 12k and it would be fun to beat that. I also hope to be able to run a 5k under 30 minutes some time. Not very ambitious goals maybe but they are enough for me. :)   Thank you!    Thank you! That is exactly how it feels. I hope that I will remember that feeling the rest of my life.   	10
 Haha Yeah it's like I genuinely feel good about it. I guess I could compare it to the same kick people get when they exercise.   Glad you like it! Although I'd suggest playing it sober first cause it's a little fast paced, just so you get used to the flow. You'll die a lot but it's so addicting.   I think everyone should seriously check out the other two games in the series though. Such a great trilogy.   For some reason when I smoke and I'm just chilling in my room I'll just have the sudden motivation to clean up and get organized. I feel pretty good about it too. Anyone else have this feeling? It's usually right after I toke, while I'm not burnt out or anything yet. Just kind of euphoric and calm.   Some people have mixed feelings about pixel art/top-down games but I highly recommend giving it a chance. The first one's only like $9.99 I'm pretty sure.   Definitely check out Hotline Miami. It's a two part game series, both on PSN. I can't even begin to explain how phenomenal this game is. Both gameplay and story. Music too. Here, check out a trailer: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5AJtaYx1Eg   Why the hell were all the comments deleted on this??   Thanks guys, I'll keep you posted!      That's exactly right but my perspective is that I'm just a little bored if there's no end game. Computers are going to keep advancing and advancing and advancing and it's not going to stop. There's always going to be something now that twenty or so years down the line is obsolete. To me it's just like "So what?". Whether you put me in Gettysburg or put me in 2057 it's all the same life. Progression doesn't really interest me. I feel like everyone is trying to reach an end game and people think society will reach utopia at some point but it won't happen. Not because (Well, not JUST because) we aren't progressing but because that would be an end game. It's always going to "get better" to someone but it seems like a vicious cycle to me that I just don't want to be a part of. I want out of the wheel that's turning and turning on for infinity with these delusions that it's all heading somewhere you know?   Dude I don't even know, it was two tabs of the strongest doses I've ever taken. None of my dealers have known about the doses so it's always been hard to say. I remember just looking around me and since I couldn't see anything it actually helped me to just focus on what I was thinking and I was kinda just like "I can't see anything... Well fuck." Haha   I couldn't agree with this more. I'm tired of the knee jerk reactions.   Welcome! I understand slight paranoia and auditory hallucinations very well, I've dealt with them a lot but it doesn't stop me from tripping still. I just recognize "I know that's not real, kinda adds to the trip, but it's not real. Most people would tell me not to trip anymore but it's whatever you're comfortable with really. The only thing that ends up frightening me is when I literally just can't see anything because I'm tripping so hard. It's like my eyes turn into wide angel lenses and I can see my center vision and my peripheral all at the same time and I start trailing on everything down to my eyelids opening and closing. Shit's intense and obviously not being able to see would frighten anyone but that's the only thing that really bothers me about intense trips.   It's okay, I didn't really get pissed off just a bit ticked. It's all under the bridge though! Nothing major   ASIDE: (Please do not read this and then read my wall of text, your perspective would more than likely be changed. This is my "self" interpretation of my perceptual glasses looking at this game.)   Now I'd like to add in my "self" perspective on all this. I don't want to play the game at all. I want know part in it. I don't want to be happy or anything else. I enjoy the toys I have but at the end of the day I recognize that there is no end game and that leaves me unfulfilled. Am I depressed? Yes, but also not exactly. If anything it gravitates toward nihilism. All of my hobbies and interests go unfulfilled and eventually they no longer make me happy because I realize how very boring it all actually is. The only thing that makes me happy is making other living things happy, people obviously included. More than that; As a mere mortal ape I would love the opportunity to become no one in the next life. This isn't for me and I'm tired of playing this ridiculous game that goes on forever. I'm not necessarily suicidal, but at the same time I am. Really hard to explain to someone that you don't want to live but you don't want to die. From a young age I've had a fascination with miniatures from city building games to toys and everything in between. I was never very good at them though, because I never knew what the "right" move was because I've always felt that the "right" move is totally based on your point of view. I'd have more fun clicking play and watching it grow on it's own. To see all the little deviations it creates and all the wonders and disasters that come with every little variation with no influence from me because I simply can't make a decision on the "right" move. They're all the right move depending on your perception. This is the same reason I've always been a bad speaker and came off as shy or awkward in conversation (I know, now I'm getting personal but I'd like to get this off my chest.) Someone could say something to me and I just go blank, I don't know what to say next. It's really hard to explain but I think you grasp the idea. I could never decide on anything. Which pet, which spouse, which family member (Family is not immune to this.), which of anything because they could all be the right decision. It's kind of a curse really but I just wanted to get a little "self" and perspective into this. Comment what you wish.    The fact that you're conscious of all this leads me to believe that your mind and sense of self is in no immediate danger. I'm not going to say "Stop using it" or "Keep using it" but if you decide to I'd simply suggest firstly, waiting a while until your next trip. Some might say a few months, I'd say maybe even a year or so. Again, the decision is yours and I or anyone you ask about it could be wrong. After your wait, just take it in moderation. That's the key to everything.   It's so hard to think of where to start with these things because it's easier when I'm already tripping and the ball is already rolling but allow me to dip my hand in the pond and pull out a fish for you. My only disclaimer is that I want you to leave your "Safety Bubble" at the door. When I say "Safety Bubble" that means anything you've latched onto throughout the course of you entire life. Every idea and political party and agenda and emotion and morals and ethics and every little thing in between. That goes very deep and I don't think many people realize how deep the bubble is. Perception is a hell of a thing. There's no way I could explain this without hurting someone's feeling's or seemingly attacking someone's ideas but that's the whole thing. I'm even going to go against my ideas and feelings, no one is safe so to speak. These feelings and ideas aren't real, it's a facade. These are things based on human interactions. Not the interactions of everything in the universe. Every cell, particle, atom, animal, person, planet, idea, emotion, etc. of everything in the universe. There's so many variations on what "Sentient" is and I mean "Universe" in an infinite scale, past dimensions and everything in between. That's what infinity really is. There are no categories of physical, mental, spiritual, or moral that they lump together as a rule. They are all in the same tumbler. Categories aren't real. I could go as far as to say physical, mental, spiritual, and moral aren't even scraping the surface of this thing. You can see how complicated this really becomes once you start looking at it like that. I'm sure there's a better example for this but it's the first thing that came to mind: You ever seen Men In Black? The end, when the ornament zooms out and it's some life forms playing with the galaxy's as marbles? It's like that, it really is. It keep going whichever way you want it to, micro and macro. Going down as small as we've seen so far from cells to particles and atoms but it keeps going. The "Gods" just keep going and going and going. We are the gods of anything smaller than us and anything smaller than us is the god of anything smaller than that and so on. That doesn't mean we are gods of living things on earth, it means we are gods to whatever is on the next smallest level to living things. I'm not a biologist so I can't come up with an example but you see where I'm getting at. Our "Gods" have gods above them too, it's infinite whichever way you're going. I use the term god very loosely. I don't mean beings in the sky with whims and who you need to pray to. I mean things above us that can't be explained any other way than to say god. They don't have ideas or morals or physical or mental or anything in between. They are not just or unjust, they just are. That should go without saying but I really want you to grasp this. They don't have the "Safety Bubble" that is perception. Can they interact with us? Yes, but not directly. Think of it as a finger in a pool. You tap the pool and it ripples throughout the whole pool, possibly causing some chaos theory depending on what your perspective is. When they tap this pool, they can tap physical, mental, anything. At will? I don't know. They more than likely don't have will. Again, they just are. Maybe there's a way to keep your sense of "self" with you once you die and maybe that explains why things have gotten terrible for us here on Earth because one of them taped the pool for no reason other than will. Now, their gods can also tap their pool too. Their pool consists of the many pools of dimensions. See, it's all just tiers of pools. From gods down to a kid in a pond, it's all the same thing. Here's something to think about: Imagine an entity comprised of pools of dimensions. Crazy to think about right? It's like our dimension is just a cell in some other thing's "body". I'm sorry it's taking so long to explain this but there's a lot to cover and no good point to start so forgive me if I jump around a bit but I'll try my best to pull you (the reader) along.  So what have we got so far? Quick summary:  - There are no categories. Physical, mental, spiritual, moral are all in the same tumbler producing variant realities. - Everything is a god to whatever is the next level below it. Micro and macro. - Everything is a pool that gets tapped and ripples everything below it. From our dimension to little unicellular and multicellular organisms in an actual pond. - These gods do not have the "Safety Bubble" glasses of perception. They just are. They may not even have free will or any will of their own. They are not good or evil. They just are.  So, let me explain this "Safety Bubble" a little bit more.  Like I said, everything you latch onto goes in the Safety Bubble. Ideas, morals, ethics, down to the littlest negative emotion you feel when I say something like "good and evil doesn't exist" or "Your loved ones don't actually matter". Striking any nerves? Leave them at the door. They aren't real. You only feel them for survival and that's it. Your body latches onto it, don't let your mind do the same. Ever watch Game Of Thrones? "A man is no one." That's how you play the game that we're all in. You can't tell people about the Safety Bubble or they draw back and get defensive. If you want whatever it is you want, you have to become no one. Let go of your perception and let your mind open up to all the possibilities because they are all true in a sort of way. Now normally people might think you have a multiple personality disorder or something or that you're a fraud or that you're shifty. These are feelings from people who are still in their bubble. Those things don't exist, it's not real. You can be whoever you want to be and that should go without saying again but it's only possible if you become no one. Yeah, it's less fun but you get more out of it in the long run (In this life) if that's what you're after. Although, we are almost cursed to run on happiness. If our feeble mortal chimp like minds aren't being amused, we lose it. We depend on happiness and that's not how progress is made. There are more things that need attending than everyone's happiness. That's only one emotion out of an infinite list from the emotional, mental, and physical that ripples through our pool. Take this information and hold it firmly. The second you start to "Feel" something or an idea shifts its way through, that means you're still in your "Safety Bubble" of perception. Get out and start playing the game instead of being played. They make new toys every year. New things come up in life that will keep you happy from people to ideas and activities and everything in between. Drop your toys and start playing the real game. Although, it's not exactly fun. Like your parents said "It's a lot worse when you're older". It's a lot worse once you're out of the play pen. Not "worse" though because that would be an idea. It just simply "Is". It's neutral, like our gods.   Dude, I'm with you one hundred percent. Sometimes your mind's eye is trippier than you thought.   Again, sorry for sounding harsh but I really didn't appreciate that comment dude.   I didn't say anything about "Getting high" or doing xanies.  After my come down and I'm feeling pretty normal and not tripping anymore, I still can't fall asleep. My brain feels like chewed gum and my eyes just don't want to close. Geez, always with assuming others reasonings or intentions. There are no set of rules on how to enjoy lucy. One guy could love taking a nature walk while another loves reading at home, they choose how to enjoy it. You chill out, I'm perfectly chill bro I just want to sleep when the trip is over for me. Sorry, that came off a little harsh and it's always hard to translate words on a computer screen. I'm not getting high and if you wanna get technical Lucy is a drug and we are all "Getting high" aren't we? Come on, get a grip dude. Trippers are not some elite group above all others you know. Sorry for coming off harsh but I hate when people try to suggest that someone's doing something YOU don't agree with and they should conform to your side of the table. This subreddit man, I thought I could come here to talk to you people but a lot of you turned out to be the same elitists that are in every group.   Or Vicodin? (I'm currently on a prescription for my wisdom teeth removal)  	21
 I don't really give a shit who I tell. I mean I don't just go around telling everyone, I have to know them enough to be generally comfortable. But if I'm feeling depressed and someone asks me what's wrong I'll tell them that I have depression and want to just be alone.   I'm terribly sorry to see this. No one deserves this pain. I'm experiencing something fairly similar unfortunately. I was with this amazing girl, we were fantastic. I knew she had depression and other issues, but I wasn't ready for her to get depressed then break up with me because she didn't feel able to be with someone. I've unfollowed her on Facebook but every once in a while I can't stop myself from looking and every time I look I experience heart shattering pain. She doesn't advertise relationships on Facebook, or her feelings all that much for that matter but when I look I'm just crushed that she isn't experiencing things with me. But this happened before and she may come back to me like she did before, but until that happens I'm afraid I'll feel this way. This extreme feeling of love and missing her. To make it worse, this all began when my depression and anxiety starting to really "bud" if you will.    My job isn't necessarily cognitively demanding, but it's more demanding than me sitting my room feeling depressed. So I use it exactly as you described the potential use for tasks. I even go to work like an hour early because when I'm at work I don't have the time to feel depressed, and it's a good distraction from my depression. Granted, the idea breaks down when we have slow night. I work in a restaurant.   I deal with this practically everyday. Everyday it's a struggle. Honestly, what I do is just tell myself that I need to. I might have nothing to to do that day, but to be a real member of society I need to get the fuck out of bed.    Everything.   Looks like I'm fucked then.    Well in a sense they are, aren't they? They're contributing to the larger collection of media which does shape and define us as a nation (I assume you're talking about American filmmakers). I mean I hate these pretentious douchebags as much as anyone, but they are contributing. I may not be in a significant way but they are  	7
    ayy lmao   Godlike,  superheros manifest during WW2 it has a chronology with dates and  events.  The first one was a german flier who Hitler hugged and declared the first Aryan.   Nooo :'C   No :C       Perfectly normal, perfectly healthy.  aha!   I sadly have to agree, it's one of the reasons i am afraid to say i'm a Portuguese player.  I think it's because they still haven't left that "roleplaying-phase" we all had, where the first characters everyone usually made were terrible anime cliches or bland copies of other media.  We all leave that phase but it has to be by our own accord, can't force it and you can't ask your weaboo friends to help you because showing up at a dnd table with Sasuchigo the demon shinigami who's destiny is to save the world and then get mad when people when they try to explain how things work and how they don't.  (this has happened to me some times it does not end well)  i could go on to explain in more detail but i don't wanna fill this thing up without good reason.    Perfectly normal, perfectly healthy.  What does that mean?   To hit things better, than the others.  Every class can try to do everything but is only an expert at a certain area.    Portugal has a very small community mostly Dnd, pathfinder(Implying it's not dnd) and V:TM.  I have seen one rpg that was made by Portuguese people and it's about children who were commissioned by death to rapture souls of other people in turn for a chance at heaven i believe. It's darker than it sounds.   How does a human turned statistic look like?   It would've saved uncle Ben. (i'm sorry)  maybe not as a full-on spandex superhero more of a casual person with a strange ability AND it'd be a great way to get to know people OOPS the elevator stopped when that special person came in.   The weirdest superpowers you would like to have   and how you would use it.  1 power per post(not person),please.   Thnks.   I remember the character was a demon who was given to human parents to raise, when he grew up the demons came back to take him, as a teenager he's flung onto a wall by a car leaving the mark of a demon on the wall.  it's an old anime  	16
    My joke was about your name. I upvoted both of your comments.   His name looked familiar to me. That's probably where I saw it.   I think your aim needs improvement lol   Most likely because kids don't get them.   That's American Sign Launguage for I Love You. Pinkie is I, pointer/thumb is L for Love, and pinkie/thumb is Y for You.   I'm not even pregnant and sometimes I whisper to my eggs that I love the babies some of them will become. I don't know if that's a baby crazy thing or a maternal type thing.    My wife deals with that. Her mom doesn't say it after phone calls or when we leave or anything. We both just get a "bye" and her dad is just as bad. In turn, we make a point of praising her sisters (15, 15,   14) and telling them we love them all the time, so they hear it from someone.   I'd argue that it's more unfair for him to have sex with her when she doesn't want than for her to not to when he does.         Thank you for the encouragement. I'm actually weird with the whole therapy thing; I've wanted to go since I was 14 and now, at 20, I have my own insurance and no one to stop me. I'm so happy to be going but nervous for the actual going.   I have a panic disorder and I'm triggered for it in some really odd situations. One of my things is that I fear people disliking me. I don't like the phone and I don't like private, one-on-one until I know someone. Its not like panic attack level, just a little worried she will decide not to like me or something. I know its irrational.   I need to pee so bad but I don't know where the bathroom is inside and I don't know if any nearby businesses will let me use them. So I'm anxious.  I tried to sit for an hour before and drink coffee in Dunkin Donuts, but a stranger literally just sat down with me. I had to leave.  I feel creepy but I didn't want to be late, so here I sit for an awkward length of time.  This is My first therapy appointment since my assessment, which my wife came to. I'm nervous about being alone with my therapist.  Its really hot in My car because it's raining and I have no gas to use the AC with.   My wife has no recollection of assault, though I have my suspicions, and cries at the site of a penis. She is horribly triggered that way    That's probably because straight people use butch as an insult. As a boidyke (softer, younger butch) call me butch all day erryday. I upvoted to help combat the awful downvotes.   Do you realize that most of that isn't necessary?    four sets of braces - who says their kids want them or need them?  music lessons - see above  tutors, sports team fees, gymnastic class, dance recitals - see above.  pediatrician co-pays - maybe they have great insurance  babysitters, vacations, the minivan, the driving lessons, the teenage car insurance rate hike - not needed, wants.   four SAT prep courses, four college educations - not needed. Scholarships, grants, etc exist as does saving through summer jobs and kids who want trade school.      If she had said she was infertile, she covered it, assuming she was post OP. He didn't really need to know that her body used to be male. However, no sex for 3 years makes me think she was pre OP.   No worries! People who aren't lesbians aren't really aware of lesbian groups/labels. There is no reason to be aware lol.    I love from My Life this section.   They will tell you you can't sleep alone  In a strange place  Then they'll tell you you can't sleep  With somebody else  Ah, but sooner or later you sleep  In your own space  Either way it's okay  You wake up with yourself    Exactly. Butch is about identity and presentation, just like femme is. Any girl, no matter how pretty, can be femme or butch, it's up to her and who she is inside.   People don't pick their own features. I'm 20 but I look like I'm 12 mist of the time because I'm baby faced. You don't have to look like Big Boo to be butch lol.    Would it really help to have this person in prison and his life ruined if he didnt know she didn't want to have sex?  If you're not 100% sure, it's not consent.      Please enlighten us about *how* this post is "ignorant bullshit".   She's totally butch! Not stone butch, but certainly more butch than boi dyke.  Source- am boi dyke.   I'm gay and don't see the appeal of her. Everyone else is like enamoured but I'm just... Not.   I was completely under the impression that this was common knowledge.   I was indicating that we weren't religious as many if not most religious groups reject gays and lesbians. My wife was Theodish which is a form of Paganism but mostly is just spiritual now and I am confirmed United Methodist but have only attended church a small handful of times in the last five years.   We're lesbians. We want children and we want them sooner rather than later.   Except you can reverse  image search.   I have six ear piercings, but all lobe. I didn't get the first set until I was 13.   Happy to hear it!   I'm 20 and my wife and I are planning on trying either this fall or next, dependent upon money and such situations.   I watched an Isis graduate on Friday.   You forget that they are all pretty much the same people.   You sound like my mom lol   I hate Alex and Piper together. They are both assholes and need to fuck off. But that scene was wonderful.   My wife has one. Every other lesbian I know has at least one. Every picture of lesbians they have tattoos. I'm over here all afraid of needles and shit.   Yes! You've admitted to going to therapy before so tell hi. You're nervous about the group dynamic.   In your brain, you have a "map" of your body. It's the reason you can touch your nose without a mirror and why you can wipe your ass without missing a bunch of times first. This map tells you where all of your parts are. For transpeople, their map tells them that they have parts they don't and don't have parts they do. For instance, many transmen have a "phantom penis", extremely similar to phantom limp syndrome. Their brain map says that it's there, so, even though it physically isn't, they can sense it.   Gender identity is solid, and inherent. It cannot be learned or learned away. In a case of a set of twin boys, one received a botched circumcision, so the parents chose to have him Go through sex reassignment surgery as an infant. As an adult, he transitioned back to being male, despite being raised as and told he was a girl.   The only proven treatment for Gender Identity Disorder is transition. As I said before, gender identity can't be learned away. There is a really high suicide rate for transgender people; they face massive amounts of discrimination, are very often disowned, poor, homeless, and especially for transgender women of color, live in constant fear of being murdered. Once a person has transitioned enough for them (it varies due to cost and outlook of surgeries for what a transperson may want out of transition) that suicide rate falls. Incidentally, being prevented from transitioning makes it rise, even with counseling.  Now, I don't know if it was intentional, but you cut off the end of my remark on chromosomes being irrelevant. I specified that many intersex people (those are people who are born partially male and partially female either chromosomally or physically in appearance) do not usually stand out as being "in between". They are raised and presented as either boys or girls, most often girls because the surgery is easier and better. That shows that, unless there is a medical problem or a transition, an intersex person can live their entire lives not knowing they were intersex and strangers wouldn't know either. This goes back to gender being assigned at birth but identity being inherent. In resent times, there has been a move away from performing sex reassignment surgery on infants for any reason, including intersexism and botched circumcision because very often, the parents guess the wrong gender identity, leading to force a person into a transition they wouldn't have had to make.   I'm not sure if you were trolling asking for more information, but if you have any other questions or if anything I said was unclear, please ask. Sorry for any typos, I wrote this on mobile.   More like your parents are only now expected to pay for your education, not hers.   It's the same company.   A half-assed handjob from some color guard skank?   It happens a lot. I am 20 and have been with my wife almost 5 years. She will be right there and a doctor will be asking me all about getting the d even after I've introduced her as my wife and stated that women are my chosen form of birth control. I live in a conservative area though, so its probably not the same in New York City or San Francisco.   But it's not acting as an ad. It's advocating theft. That's the opposite of an ad.   -Che Guevara   I get all of that but when I have already stated twice that I have never had sex with a man, I think it's time to let the question go.    My wife says that I am all bark and no bite and 100% harmless. She is high femme but wears the pants.   Flair time?   I can see that side of it. When someone claims pictures of pennies are a trigger because they were poor that's excessive.    I have a diagnosed panic disorder and i have triggers because of it. I love thy "misuse" of the word trigger. It draws attention to the existence of triggers and helps create mindfulness.    http://www.expertlaw.com/forums/showthread.php?t=105808  I'm reading that you can't be arrested for it, but that if you are refusing to even go to the hearing for a suit you can be imprisoned for contempt of court.   Hey there chest almost twin! I'm a 40HH so we are only like a hair apart. I have an Underworks 997 and it's effective enough, it just hurts if I wear if for too long. I don't really struggle to get flat enough so you probably won't either r   Secret codes.   Idk about the rest of the world, but in the US public hospitals can't refuse you and the bills can't get you arrested and often disappear from your credit report after a certain length of time.

Girl Code on MTV!   We have actually been discussing it and I am working o. Losing weight -blah- to make getting pregnant easier!   Maybe you were working bard at bumping uglies to keep that pelvis fractured.   I totally get the need to ask. They have to ask anyone with a uterus and that makes sense, but if I tell you outright that I have never interacted with sperm, then let it go.   I should have. I was 17 and had no balls though.   Aspects of any life are choices and you are making it sound as though I deserve different treatment for being gay. She is not my partner, She is my wife. I have the marriage license to prove it.   My wife once had a neckbeardy male doctor argue with her about if she might be "experimenting". It was creepy as hell and she told him like 7 times that she wasn't pregnant and had never been with a man.   The childish college behavior is why I, as a liberal college student, work with other liberals over 40. They have the life experience and know how to get shit done.   It fascinates me that most people with self-made are liberal and those who inherit the wealth are conservative. Its so opposite of the beliefs. Conservatives think you should keep what you earn when inheriters didn't earn it and liberals think you should share to help all when they did earn it. Its just so interesting to me that that happens.   I may have! I'll have to change next time I'm not on mobile!   I suppose being in a relationship at all with a woman is a lifestyle choice then. We both know that she wasn't talking about same sex marriage, I just refuse to call my wife something she isn't. She was referring to being gay as it being a lifestyle choice which is not only wrong, but homophobic. No one calls it a "lifestyle choice" when straight people decide to date.   lifestyle choices  Imma stop you right there. My love for my wife isn't a "lifestyle choice". Its a small part of my personality and you could use a step back to educate yourself on being so wonderfully tolerant.       We are planning to use an anonymous donor but at considering a known donor if it matters. I will carry as she has PCOS and a high risk of miscarriage. Will we have to do second parent adoption or can I just list my wife on our baby's birth certificate? Does it matter if we know the donor or not? We really don't want to deal with a home study and get permission for her to be our child's mother. I can't seem to find any information via Google though, so any help helps.   [My wife and I have been married for 6 months and 3 days today!](http://imgur.com/QxZbajA)   We are planning to use an anonymous donor but at considering a known donor if it matters. I will carry as she has PCOS and a high risk of miscarriage. Will we have to do second parent adoption or can I just list my wife on our baby's birth certificate? Does it matter if we know the donor or not? We really don't want to deal with a home study and get permission for her to be our child's mother. I can't seem to find any information via Google though, so any help helps.   Actually, biology and neurology are exactly what make Caitlyn Jenner a woman, just not chromosomes, which aren't really relevant as plenty of people who are intersex are easily read one way or the other. As for Rachel, well race is a social construct, so how one can identify as something that isn't real I don't get, but maybe she identifies with what she stereotypes to be black culture, and I guess that's okay but making up all these bullshit lies isn't.   The cruise ship requires you to buy their food and drink, use the entertainment venues, etc. Reddit requires you follow their rules or leave. Not even close to slave labor.   We are passengers on a cruise ship; without us, the cruise ship is a big waste of money, but if we don't like the cruise ship, we can use a different cruise line.   They've been able to replicate sperm from stem cells in rats for some time now, albeit not with great success in survival. I want to know how eventually transmen and lesbians with be able to offer the other half of DNA and produce a son, since genetic females only have XX and no Y.   That is amazing!   I don't identify as sapiosexual or anything and I think it's obnoxious to label such things, but intelligence is my number one attraction to people. I doubt it's that common with some the people I know who have relationships.   Wait... I did something backward. My wife and I are both slobs and she has a low sex drive.   Hopefully this will soon translate to transplants for transmen. (That sentence had a lot of "trans" in it.)      Even backwards is too much for me. I'm just going to call and make it clear that I will have a panic attack. I'm going to try having them talk to me, too. That's really great advice. Thank!   My wife got it!   When she was 16, we had just started dating. We are both women.  Her mom: Are you sad that you don't have a boyfriend like your younger sister?  Wife: Nope. I'm good.  Her mom: Is it because you have a girlfriend?  Wife: ...yes.  Her mom: IS IT TRISH?  Wife: ...yes. How did you know that?  Her mom: just be careful. I was bi in high school and you can get... Diseases... From girls too.   My mom has really bad health, and for the last three years, every trip to the doctor for her has delivered worse news. I finally have insurance and I should go, but thinking about it gives me anxiety. I think I have hypothyroidism, which my mom has, and I know the best thing is to treat it, but I don't like needles. My depression and possibly the hypothyroidism has made me obese, which I've been since childhood (I'm 20) and thinking about getting on a scale is giving me severe anxiety and I know having no choice would send me into an exhausting panic attack. Can I refuse? Should I explain on the phone first that it's a trigger for my panic attacks? Can I insist on only testing thyroid stuff with blood work? I don't have the energy to deal with anything else and the idea of more is causing me anxiety. I don't know if this is the right place, but I just wanted to know.   My top two songs on my phone are Seasons of Love and Take Me or Leave Me.      Lesbian here. My wife and I both agree that anything Maia is worth the money.   This is really beautifully written, and I'm sorry you suffered through that. Come on over to /r/depression, we have a supportive community and like to listen.   Why not take a one year old on a Hawaiian Vacation?   It may be different for you, but for me, wallowing in my depression makes it worse. Something I like is to have a playlist of songs that work for me to help bring me up. Maybe give that a shot.   You are capable of recognizing that you aren't perfect.   You aren't below average; just average. That's normal.  You have survived to 23, so you aren't a failure.  Your life is not the lives of those you graduated with.  23 is like 60 years more to make a change.  You know some flaws so you can change them.  You're well articulated.  You're capable of admitting to not understanding. That's a hell of a lot better than most people winging it.  Adulthood isn't having all the answers; it's being willing to look for them.    Thank you so much. I really appreciate the support and you put a really big smile on my face!   Thanks for the info! My wife has PCOS and my mom had cervical cancer so I have to get a pap yearly.   A lot of gynecological care is cervical, uterine, and ovarian. Yeast infections aren't vagina only, nor are UTIs. When I've had either in the past (faab) I've gone to planned parenthood or to Wal-Mart for treatment.   If you have female genitals, you need to be getting an annual. You can still get cancer, endometriosis, PCOS, etc.  Edit: at PP for UTIs I just get a prescription after peeing in a cup, no exam.   Do transwomen need gynecologic care? I am not really educated about it.   So he has no grandparents.   Thank you for the words of encouragement!   I said I felt other subs should be included. The thing is, those communities don't advocate the level of harassment that fph did.   An example; Personally, I enjoy r/justneckbeardthings. Recently, the sub has gone from making fun of shitty "le friendzone" behavior to making fun of people's interests, hobbies, and looks. I like when it's about the messages and such, but I unsubbed when it became just cruel. I think that, along with fph and related subs, it should have been taken down.    It's bullshit. They don't belong here.   I was expecting General Anxiety Disorder. What should I know about this and the differences?   I wrote "crick" in a third grade project because of my dad.      To be fair, it was self-labeled a hate group. The Westboro Baptist Church is an anti-LGBT hate group. No one would care if they sat around bitching about gay people; people care because they harass gay people. No one would have cared if FPH just sat around bitching.   I am liking not working. My mom is very sick and physically disabled and work was the one thing I could cut out reasonably - education is paramount to me, so I'd rather struggle for money than not go to school. My job was contributing for sure. I worked as a companion to a man with Down syndrome and, while it could be rewarding and was like no real work (I actually got paid to go bowling and play in parks) it was stressful to be responsible for him especially when they stopped paying. It has helped, but it's hard to judge as, two weeks after I quit, my mom was diagnosed with cirrhosis of the liver because of fatty liver disease that we didn't know she had. That's been really hard on me, but I know it would be much harder if I were working on top of it.  I am very extroverted. I love talking to people in person. I just have strong opinions and I'm sort of judgmental. I look forward to meeting new people and I want to help. I am a social work major and I want to work with mentally ill adolescents, so I will be happy to make suggestions.   I'm very excited about school. I'm switching from community college to a university, and it's a large state school with a massive gay community (I'm butch so since I'm very visible that's important to me) and I'm hoping its a more adult atmosphere than kids screwing off in CC.   My wife is my rock. She helps with my mom and does anything I need to help me. She is a wonderful person.  I don't feel cursed, lol. The girl's ex told me about it. I have an acquaintance who is weird about stuff like that who gave me some sage to keep in my car "just to be safe" but I don't really think she "cursed" me, at least not in any way that really affects me.   I will certainly check that book out. I've tried talking on here about building friendships and something I learned that worked (other than the fact that I used it on someone awful) was to act like people are already your friend, and the friendship will built; that even though it's scary, you need to ask people to hang out first. Right now I'm just isolated and having a hard time finding people to build friendships with.   Book the next one at your appointment. Tell the counselor that this is what happens and they will help. I hope it gets better.   That's my understanding; that we are all similar.  I quit working in part because of my depression and in part because my job stopped depositing my pay. My wife is on board with that decision and works more to pick up the slack so I can work on me. I haven't started group yet but the only people I really talk to are redditors and rarely conversation on Facebook. I have been told that I'm peanut butter and a lot of people are allergic to peanut butter; I don't make friends easily. I had to drop out of college this semester due to family stuff, and I am starting at a New school in August, so I'm hoping I can make friends there, but a year and a half at the first one only got me a Santaria witch that tried to put a curse on me so that wasn't great.   I agree! This also rolls over into more scientific advancement, granting transwomen better medical options. It doesn't hurt that transmen have better results with hormones generally and pass and blend easier. It's a multiedged sword.   *disclaimer* I'm happy about the ban and think some other subs should have been included.  I think the idea was that the sub was fostering an environment that encouraged that behaviour. I mean it was all about photographing strangers just to make fun of their appearance. It was a really hostile place and I don't know of a better way to have had it handled.   It's cool! He's got two dads!   Yes they are similar diagnosis. Part of the reason for group is that I have literally no friends offline and obviously that isn't healthy. I appreciate the offer to chat and if I ever need I will take you up on that. Thank you.   I play videogames then, particularly open ended games like Runescape or Sims. I don't have to meet a goal and I kill hours. I don't know if that will help you, but I like it.   Don't think you don't help her; it probably just hurts that it's long distance. I'd bet a 100 bucks that it's the distance that hurts her, not you. Maybe in a year you guys can close that distance and resume. Try being friends. Without being pushy, tell her that you love her and care and are there for her in any capacity she needs you to be. Show her that you won't leave her that easy; I've noticed that women especially fear abandonment due to depression. (I'm also a woman who has this.)  Also, people can't be fixed without fixing themselves. Trying to fix someone else will never fix you. If you have health insurance or can afford to, seek counseling, even if just for a short time. I don't know the intricacies of your relationship with her, so I'm just going with what I know. Someone else may be able to help you more.   Don't be afraid to look elsewhere for love. You may surprise yourself, but note that it's hard to love someone else when you don't love yourself, so work on you a bit before jumping right in head first.   I'm exhausted. I was super anxious beforehand so now that it's over I'm tired. I sought free counseling out from my college about 9 months ago but it wasn't meant to be long term. I like having the schedule of appointments to go to but actually dealing with my appointments is hard. Its funny, I've wanted therapy for about 6 years and this is my first time as an adult having insurance (with no copay for individual or group!!!!) and I was so excited to start but it is hard.   Hairspray or Rock of Ages. I love musicals.    What about it hurts you the most?   Find something you want to do. Make it simple as smell a flower. It gives you something to look forward to accomplishing and gives you something daily to accomplish, or weekly if that's less overwhelming.   I'm going to start saying that now.   Lesbian here; my dad loves my wife. When we started dating I got replaced as daddy's little girl; she gets that now.    Why not teach them about birth control?   Just my two cents; maybe relax that rule a bit for committed, long term relationships, like of a year or more. I started dating my now wife at 15 and we were living together before either of us was 18 because of shit with her family. It would have been awful to wait until we were both 18.   Did you have daughters? Did they get condoms or BC pills for Christmas?    I'm not saying you are wrong, I just offering another point of view. Feel free to disregard.  Porn: even if you severely limit is ability to get it, he will see it. Its a world of smartphones and WiFi everywhere. Perhaps explain, instead, that porn can quickly become a dangerous addiction. Maybe offer to on-the-sly buy him magazines; they are less hardcore and not the videos that many people are hooked on. If it matters to you, explain that pornography actresses are actresses, they are real women doing not real things. You would never want your wife/mother/sister/etc to be in a situation where she was forced into it; most pornstars are such because of limited options.   Premarital sex; I actually hope my kids have premarital sex. My mom, before my wife and I ever got married, told both of us to "try on the shoes before you buy them". She and I agree that you should be sexually compatible for the best chance at a strong marriage. We also think you should live with someone first before marriage to make sure you can live together.  Sex in your home: if he is going to have sex, he is going to. By outright disallowing it in your home, you actually put him at risk. If his partner's parents do the same, that leaves public places and a chance at arrests. My parents had an unspoken don't as don't tell policy on sex in their home.   A big issue with religion in the modern world is that it struggles to line up with it. In a society where tinder is a thing, it's hard to expect a 16 year old kid to remain abstinent. Its hard for that kid to remain abstinent. Try to mold your beliefs around the world, where possible, and offer explanation beyond religion If you want your children to remain Christian.   My girlfriend (now wife) and I were 16 and together for six months when we started to have sleepovers. We were supposed to be in different beds but that never happened. We are gay, though, so pregnancy was never really an issue and we were both so young that we were only ever each other's sexual partner so neither were STIs. Because of all that, my parents were lax when my brother, at 16, started seeing his girlfriend. They are still together at 19, so I guess it worked out okay.      I don't know; by 5 and a half months, it's kind of be a mother or let someone else be a mother. As you said, there has to be a cutoff and she was after said cutoff and to a point where most people would agree It's far too late to abort. I don't know if it's mentioned in this article, but the CNN story says that the boy lived for an hour before finally passing away. That's wrong, to intentionally do that. I don't think she should receive the death penalty, but she does deserve to be punished; she intentionally ended a viable life.   Edit: apparently the charge has been dropped. http://www.wcvb.com/health/murder-charge-for-woman-who-took-abortion-pill-questioned/33501262   Hey there, Ollie! I'm Trish May or Patric Mayson!   Not even once. It's a fetish in the straight community, too, so don't bring that gays are pedos bullshit at me.   You're disgusting if you think that that is okay.   16 and 30 are worlds apart. You are old enough to be her father. She is a high school student, you are a professional. You will be a father figure and nothing more.   If the girlfriend doesn't like you and you're already drifting, what's to lose? Tell him and look out for him. If he ignores you that's his gig.   http://imgur.com/kXBfXU1   As a lesbian, this is one of my favorite parts.   Fewer tickets, not none lol. Dude if we had female immunity in traffic There would be so many more wrecks just from all the reckless driving.   I may do that. A potted plant is so much more low-key.   Well women are disadvantaged in a lot of ways, and overt sexism against women does exist, but women certainly get some benefits; assumed custody of kids, no speeding tickets, shorter prison sentences, etc.   I wanted a garden really bad, for vegetables. But to get it, I had to dig out the spot of the old one and lay chicken wire and bury it all. Then I had to buy and plant plants. It was too overwhelming and I couldn't do it. Now I'm depressed that u don't have my garden.   Women get this, too! I was pulled over by a state trooper doing 30 over the speed limit. I got off with a warning. In my state, they could pull my licence for that.  Edit: I am a white woman talking about my own privilege and being downvoted. I don't get this.   I usually dream about my car having no brakes, which supposedly means the same thing.   Dollar Tree (at least near me) carries a night guard to keep from grinding. If cost is an issue you can try that first.   Lmfao! No. I was fifteen when we had sex for the first time and we had only been dating a month and a half. We were together over four years when we got married.    This was actually an okay question. If he wanted details then it's fucked  up.   So you're a transwoman! That's great! If I wasn't married and you had had bottom surgery we may have had a chance.   I paid 13 each for my first two, twenty for the cage setup and ended up moving it all to a 10 dollar tank, 5 for bedding, and I pay like 15 a month for my five. I use aspen bedding and just buy food.   I think vulvas are pretty...  	145
 I think you're right about this. It seems like they haven't been together that long, so it's possible they just haven't talked about it until just now.   Thanks. I try ;)   Him being a virgin who doesn't believe in sex before marriage makes his reaction make a lot more sense.  For someone who was raised in a conservative religious household, sex is often stigmatized. You're taught that sex is bad outside of marriage, and even then it's still something dirty or naughty unless you're trying to have children. Many religious people believe that sex is purely for procreation, and if you find pleasure in sex you're made to feel guilty. You're told you're wrong, broken, and used up. It's very hard for someone raised in this sort of environment to deal with sexuality - even their own.   It seems like Ken made a lot of assumptions about you, and now that those assumptions turned out to be false he's freaking out. I'm not sure how strongly he feels about premarital sex, but if he were being reasonable about it he would probably think that while he was raised a certain way and has a religious preference that dictates his sexual behavior, not everyone else was raised the way he was and they shouldn't have to meet his standards.   If he doesn't want to have sex with you unless you get married, that's fine - it's his choice. But if he no longer respects you because he now knows you're not a virgin, that's wrong and not a good foundation for a healthy relationship.   Hopefully if you give him time and show him some compassion, he'll get over this. But if he just can't get past the fact that you've had sex with other people then he probably isn't worth your time.   Well, being 17 and not having any romantic experience isn't really unusual or unheard of, so what you're going through is actually pretty normal. It's okay to feel unsure of yourself and nervous about possibly being with someone, especially as a teen.   Considering you just went through a really rough period of your life, it's probably a good idea to just take things slow and figure out what you want/need. Parents getting divorced is a huge deal, and maybe you still need time to process that. My parents divorced when I was 17, so I can relate.   As far as this girl, it seems like the two of you have really hit it off. If you get along well and she's already expressed to other people that she likes you, then you would most likely be able to go out with her if you asked.   My first suggestion would be for you to ask her if she wants to hang out with just the two of you. It seems like all the times you've been together so far were at social events with larger groups of people, so you should ask her if she wants to just spend time together with you. It doesn't have to be anything fancy, just text or call and say, "hey, do you want to come over this weekend?" You could watch a movie on Netflix, maybe play some video or board games, or just sit around and talk. Keep it simple.   Having time with just the two of you will help you get to know each other better. Clearly you get along, and getting in a little quality time will probably help both of you feel more relaxed around each other and ease into dating.   Ah, okay. I think we're good then.   I think issues of consent are really important, and definitely should be talked about more, which things like this comic can bring about. But yeah, nothing in life is super black and white and these sorts of conversations need nuance and context to be at all meaningful.   Well the way I understood it was that the person in the comic let someone borrow their car once and have permission for that one time, but not for multiple times, and it's wrong to automatically assume that because you borrowed it once that you can borrow it again without permission. My argument was, you can also consent to letting someone borrow your car as much as they want for a week or month - why can't the same thing apply to sex?   No, merely being "impaired" by alcohol doesn't constitute "unable to consent" under any law, in almost every case it's "incapacitated"  I was under the impression that if you were intoxicated to the point of being over the legal limit to drive that counted as unable to consent. This could just be a misunderstanding or incorrect assumption on my part. But for instance, I'm pretty sure that if you sign a contract while over the legal limit, it's considered invalid because you're too impaired to fully comprehend what you're reading. And I know that a lot of people the rule of thumb that if you're too drunk to drive, you're too drunk for sex.   I absolutely agree that if someone is drunk to the point of incapacitation they cannot consent, but I also know that there are several steps along the way to that point where you could still give consent (like if you're only slightly buzzed).  It's possible that we're both arguing about something without realizing that's not what the other person is saying. Situations of being black out drunk or unconscious are absolutely, no question you aren't able to consent. I'm not fighting that.   And some couples absolutely do have an understanding that they're up for being woken up with sex, etc - and this would be rape under current laws.  This is the part I'm hung up on. Because yes, there should be protections in place for situations like that, but I also believe that the legal definition of what constitutes sexual assault or rape and what people actually consent to don't always line up. The couple who has a blanket agreement that waking up to sex is awesome wouldn't consider their partner doing something they want and already gave the other partner permission for rape. And that's what I'm trying to distinguish here.   Not necessarily. The comic was making a point that just because someone agrees to one act doesn't mean they automatically agree to continuous acts. It didn't say you can't also agree to continuous acts ahead of time. Although it's still a good idea to check in occasionally.   Perhaps I should clarify. If you and a spouse have a healthy relationship and you both decide beforehand that you don't mind having sex after a glass or two of wine or a few beers (enough to technically be drunk but still responsive and remember everything) then I don't really see a problem. Lots of couples have some sort of standing agreement where certain sex acts are deemed generally okay whenever (kissing or groping, for instance). They of course still have the right to refuse in the moment, and if their partner doesn't respect that, it's rape.   For a more concrete example, if my fiance and I had a date, and I told him before hand that I planned on having sex that night, we both got mildly drunk, and then he initiated sex (touching or kissing), at that point if I changed my mind I would say no and he would back off. If I was still up for it, we would then have sex. If both of us are willing at this point to do it, even if we're impaired by alcohol (which would constitute unable to consent with most laws), I don't believe it's rape for him to have sex with me. But we also have built up trust and commutation skills so that we know when the other person is willing or not, regardless of alcohol. And that is dependent on the individual people involved.   If I at any point felt uncomfortable during this scenario and he pushed me into sex anyway, that would be wrong. But if I plan on having sex, continuously and enthusiastically say yes, still retain most if my facilities, and have no regrets afterward, but it's technically considered nonconsensual according to the law, is it rape? I don't consider myself to have been raped, even though I've been in this situation a few times. And that's why in most cases you also need to have a complainant before you enforce that law.   No problem. Happy I could clarify for you   Honestly it was just bad wording all around. You probably should have clarified more and said "my girlfriend is afraid other people think she is a whore because of her past, and I don't know how to convince her she isn't." The way you put it in your post it sounded like she asked if you/other people think she's a whore and you were just like "I dunno, maybe"  That sort of implies you think she might be a whore   If only one is drunk, the sober person is at fault. If both are very drunk, then it's not really either person's fault because neither could properly consent.   Sometimes even if you really love someone, there can just be too much emotional baggage to deal with and it's better to just start over. But that's not to say you can't work past things, either.   Clearly, you are feeling the stress of being a sole financial provider in a situation where you just don't make enough. And that can put strain on any marriage, let alone one with as many problems as yours. This needs to change if things are going to get better.   Speaking as someone with chronic mental illness, I know how difficult it can be to act as a functional adult. But at the same time, you can't grow if you never put yourself out there. Has your SO ever tried to get a job before? It's there possibly some kind of freelance work or something they could do from home that will bring in a little extra money? Perhaps you could encourage them to start applying to places. It can be scary, but ultimately you'll both be better off if they can help you carry the financial burden. But if they seriously aren't capable of working, they might be able to apply for SSI depending on if they're eligible.   As for the cheating, there's no right time frame to be over something like that. It might help to talk to a counselor about it.   I can see why you're terrified and I sincerely hope things get better for you soon. Feel free to PM if you ever need a sympathetic ear.   Seriously? The word "whore" is almost exclusively used to shame women for being sexual. And if you need to ask the internet whether or not your girlfriend comes off as a whore, that's pretty concerning.   Like I said before, her sexual history is her business and no one else's. The only sort of person who would call her a whore for it a) is looking way too much into sometime else's private life where it doesn't concern them and b) is seriously judgemental. Who are these mysterious people she's concerned are judging her? Because if people are actually saying this she should tell them to fuck off. And as her boyfriend, you should reassure her that her past partners don't matter, because her self worth isn't inversely proportional to how many people she's slept with.   In my opinion, no, you should not get back together. You started dating a decade ago and broke up when you were what, 18? 19? You're in your mid-20s now. At this point you are probably very different people than when you first started dating or when you ended the relationship. So yeah, you might still have feelings for him, but it's not a great idea to get involved with someone out of childhood nostalgia when you have no idea if you have anything in common in the here and now.   Another good reason to not do this would be the way you broke up. Not only did he side with his obviously prejudiced mom over you, he was horrible to you for a long time after the initial break up too. You said so yourself, what he did was unforgivable. Why would you want a relationship with someone who didn't trust you, turned against you, said horrible things to you, and then repeatedly insulted you? If you hadn't transferred, he would probably have continued to be petty and insult you whenever you met. Plus, you'd have to deal with his awful family again and that's no picnic.   I'm glad he realized he was wrong and was big enough to own up to it and apologize, but that doesn't make all the things he did magically okay. You're right to be worried that if he burned you before he could do it again. He might have learned his lesson, but can you honestly trust him after all that?   I was about to ask the same question, but if you're still pretty young then it makes a lot more sense to wait a year. Also there's nothing weird about you or her; it's just that she's more comfortable with the idea of dating than you. No biggie. People deal with things differently. Just take your time and enjoy yourself - and try not to over think things too much.   Is your girlfriend currently getting paid to have sex with people? No? Then what on earth makes you think it's appropriate to ask if she's a whore?  If what you're actually asking is "does my girlfriend's sexual history make her (and/or myself) look bad" then the answer is still no, and it's still inappropriate to ask. If she is getting sober, good for her. If she regrets things the did in the past, well, no one's perfect. But how many and what sort of people she's had sex with is her business and no one else's, and broadcasting it all over the internet so you can get other people to tell you if it's okay to shame her is gross.   It could be a problem, but it is most likely not that big a deal. However, you should definitely talk to him about it. If you're feeling uncomfortable, you should do some self-exploration and try to figure what it is exactly about this that bothers you. Is it because you feel like he's giving more attention to her than you? Or maybe because you're feeling a little insecure?   Once you think you've got that figured out, approach your bf. Tell him in a non-accusatory way what you're feeling and why. Make sure to use "I/me" statements. For example, "when you talk to your friend so much, I feel uncomfortable because [reason]" is better than "you shouldn't talk to her so much, you're making me feel bad." Focusing on your emotions rather than his actions can help you have a productive discussion where you feel validated but he doesn't have to get defensive.  If your bf cares about your feelings (which I'm sure he does) he wouldn't intentionally do something to hurt you. So if you approach him from a place of "I need your help with this problem" he'll be more willing to work with you and it's less likely to cause a fight. Hopefully you can both come to a solution that lets him keep his friend and puts you at ease.   I think the most likely explanation is that he's just catching up with someone he hasn't talked to in a while. If they were out of touch but still on good terms, he probably just missed her company. It's natural after meeting up with an old friend to want to hang out with them a lot, so you can find it what's been going on with them, do all the stuff you missed out on when you were apart, and make new memories.   The ISSJ should have some sort of records of the adoption. I would start there. Find a way to contact them, tell them all these details, and see if they can point you in the right direction.   Honestly, if you don't like Sandy, John is a cheating douche, and everyone else is boring, why do you still hang it with these people? It sounds like the only person you're really friends with is Sandy's brother. So stop hanging out with everyone else and just chill one on one with that guy. You'd probably enjoy your time with him a lot more without all the other drama from other people.   Depending on where you live, there are lots of places that have free or cheap mental health services (like universities). It sounds like your girlfriend has been seriously traumatized, and also her mother is super toxic, so yeah, therapy asap would be good.   And like others have said, a religious official would be the next best thing if you can't find a licensed therapist. Although, the caveat there is that most priests and such do not have any training in mental health problems. They can't give a diagnoses or proper treatment, they can just listen and try to help you as best they can.   I also found [this](http://www.7cupsoftea.com/) website, never used it personally but it might be a good place to start and tide her over until you can find a more permanent solution   Well if you are married and you already have a previously communicated understanding that "if we get tipsy, it's cool to have sex still" then obviously that wouldn't be rape. You have a trust with that person, you've talked about it while sober before getting drunk, and you both know if you don't want to you can say something before drinking and nothing will happen. But most of the time when people talk about drunk sex and consent, the idea is that if you DON'T have a previous (sober) understanding and you come on to someone who's really drunk or they come on to you, they can't really consent at that point and you shouldn't have sex.   Lol I wish   Oh yeah I knew about the head trophy thing. So creepy. Ugh   I thought he dumped his victims in the woods? Bundy drove around a lot while looking for victims   Okay, I'll definitely talk to my gyno about it   I was actually referring to John Wayne Gacy, I'm pretty sure most of Dahmer's victims ended up buried out in the woods or shoved into barrels   I mentioned this in another comment, but I did bring up the possibility to my gyno at my last visit. But she was really reluctant to diagnose me. She said that apparently a lot of people come in thinking they have endometriosis but since the only way to actually diagnose it is through surgery, she wanted to exhaust all the other possibilities first. So I went through a whole bunch of tests to rule out other things.   Not gonna lie, your story sounds like a Criminal Minds episode. It seems to me like this secret admirer of yours doesn't really want to meet up, because then they could be rejected or their ideal meeting might not go as planned, so they're just yanking you around with all these "dates" that go nowhere. As long as they keep you at a distance, they have all the control and can keep up the fantasy indefinitely.   Maybe they assumed she was covered up for religious modesty?   That doesn't stop some people   If that's true this just got 11 times creepier   Um, no, no it wouldn't. I don't care who sent it. If they showed up at my doorstep it could be the sexiest man in the whole world for all I care and I would still tell him to fuck off and call the police after sending message like that.   Edit: fixed autocorrect typos   I don't really, no, but at least three different people have suggested I might have it before. One of them was a nurse whenever I went to the emergency room once.   That sounds heavenly lol   At my next appointment I'm definitely gonna bring it up again because this period situation is getting ridiculous   That's a very good non-sarcastic answer (unlike mine)   I haven't tried that many kinds because doctor visits and filling prescriptions are expensive. But I've been heavily considering an IUD. I've heard a lot of good things about them.   Thanks! I appreciate it. Glad you finally found some relief!   Thanks for the suggestion. I'll try it   No problem, glad I can help.   And at least in my opinion, it's not bad that you're happier in your new relationship, the bad part is that you were so miserable about your family situation before then that you would cry about it when seeing things like the wedding or birth announcements. That shows you were seriously stressed out about it, and that much stress really isn't healthy.   It sounds to me like OP is doing that. Saying you can't decide whether or not you can commit long-term to someone even after two years is a bit of a stretch. There are people who get engaged after knowing each other for a few months, and people who live together more than a decade before getting married. It's just finding what works for you.   Now when it comes to involving the child, of course it gets more complicated. I don't think it should necessarily have to be that the kids of a single parent never meet anyone while they're just dating. You should definitely wait to make sure you like them, but it would also be bad to wait too long. What if, hypothetically, OP waited to introduce this guy to her daughter after five years of dating? Or ten? Then after getting seriously committed and definitely knowing they're in love and want to get married, she introduces daughter, and only then finds out her partner and children are incompatible? That would be bad for all parties involved. I think if you introduce the child slowly to the person before ever mentioning being a family, it wouldn't be so bad. But that's just my two cents.  You're right, her daughter is having issues and that's certainly a problem. But I don't think that not seeing this guy because you think she can't possibly know him well enough isn't really the answer. Also, they're dating if they say they are dating.   I agree, single parents should be really careful about who they bring home to their kids. I was the child of a single mom, so yeah, I know first hand what that does to a kid. My mom and step dad got divorced when I was already 18, but my much younger siblings struggles with it for a while. My mom found a new guy, and they got serious pretty fast - they were engaged within a year of the start of their relationship. This was mitigated by the fact they had been childhood friends (so therefore knew each other really well) but until my mom started dating him I'd never even heard of this guy.   So yeah, there was a huge adjustment period for everyone. I was already in college so I wasn't affected as much, but my brother was just starting high school and my sister was still in elementary school whenever my mom got divorced from their dad. And my brother had huge issues accepting his new father figure. In fact, he even accused my mom's fiance of abuse. It wasn't true - I know this for a fact because I witnessed the incident personally - but it was indicative of the fact that those two were not at all getting along. But this had less to do with my mom bringing home a new dad and more to do with the fact that my brother had severe mental health issues and was manipulated and enabled by my step father to hate the new guy, act out against my mom, and generally be a terror.   My sister, on the other hand, ended up liking him just fine. It was confusing for her at first, but she got over it pretty quickly. Much like OP, my mom's ex husband was abusive and a poor caretaker, and my mom was horribly lonely after breaking up with him. And she probably rushed into her new relationship a bit. But they are happily married now, and I can say my sister is much better off being taken care of by two happy, loving parents in a stable relationship than she was by my mom while single, overworked, and miserable, or by my mom and step dad when they were still together.   I'll talk to my gyno about it next time I go.   I'm turning 23 next month. I do want to have kids, but I'll probably only have one through pregnancy, the rest through adoption. So obviously I'm not going to do it anytime soon. It's just a very tempting thought whenever I'm in the middle of my period.   As for whether my cycle changes after getting pregnant, I've also heard this is possible, but if genetics have anything to say about it I probably won't be that lucky. My paternal grandmother had awful periods, and I'm pretty sure she just waited for menopause to deal with it. My mom had so many problems with periods (horrible cramps and extremely heavy flow for two weeks or so) she got an endometrial ablation. That was after three kids. So I can hope, but I'm not holding my breath on that one, lol.  I've started talking to a gyno about it more recently as I've realized more and more that this isn't totally normal, and we're working on it, so hopefully we will figure something out. Thanks for your thoughts and internet hugs, I appreciate it.   I don't get the appeal behind obsessing over celebrity gossip, either. I'm with you - who cares? Just let people do their own thing.   I feel like this is another entry for #relentlesslygay and I love everything about it.   I haven't tried the pill continuously, although it it's tempting. I might have to talk to my doctor about that.   I haven't tried the shot, but I was on the pill where you had a period every three months (as well as the usual monthly kind). It was nice that I didn't have to deal with it as often, but it still sucked whenever I did have one.   Yikes. Mine do last a while but not that long or heavy. I'm glad you found a treatment that helped and I hope your surgery goes well.   I have been talking to my gyno about this, and she's done some tests. I don't have any STDs and uterus liked normal in two different ultrasounds, so I'm still not sure what the problem is. At one point a nurse brought up the possibility of endometriosis, but my gyno is reluctant with that because the only way to know for sure is exploratory surgery and she wants to rule out everything else before we try that.   One of my biggest issues with the vast majority of pro-lifers I've met is that they preach all day long about the sanctity of a fetus but are simultaneously against any form of welfare for that child once it's born and are against the LGBTQ "life style". If you really cared about life that much, you would have a little more empathy for the children who are born into poverty, abusive homes, and/or discrimination. That's why I call those people "anti-choice" rather than "pro-life".  Now, if you're against abortion because you want to protect the fetus, but also apply that same consideration and respect for life to the poor, queer folks, women, racial minorities, etc. then I will respectfully disagree with your stance on certain medical procedures but I will gladly work with you on other things.   That is super fucking creepy. I would say "alert the police" but they won't actually do anything because they don't really care in most cases and it's not technically illegal until after they've already kidnapped you and buried you in their crawlspace   Oh yes, Lord forbid we allow young people to know how sex and love and relationships work. That would be so awful. Much better to shame their bodies and their sexuality, so that they're vulnerable to peer pressure, STIs, unwanted pregnancy, dysfunctional relationships, abuse, assault, etc. You know, the way God intended.   Fyi, asexual =/= no libido. Just say no libido. But you're right, the sudden drop is somewhat abnormal and talking to a gyno would probably be a good idea. Depending on where you live you might not need parental approval for an appointment - some states in the U.S. allow you to go doctors at 16 without parental permission. You can always call a local gyno and ask if you need permission from your mom to make an appointment. If not, then you're golden. If you do, you might be able to at least just talk to one over the phone about your problem.   I hate my periods. I know, shocker, right? But bear with me, I just need to rant.   Well I can't speak for all of you who have them, but I'm pretty sure mine are somewhere in the worse end of the spectrum. I get all the terrible symptoms. Cramps, diarrhea, fever, nausea, vomiting, bloating, motion sickness, sweating, chills, all that nonsense. Every month it's like I have the flu only with an added helping of abdominal pain and vaginal bleeding. Even if I take triple or quadruple the dose of ibuprofen, it barely takes the edge off of the pain. If I don't take them, I'm completely non-functioning for 24-36 hours. All I will do is writhe around my bed in pain; forget eating, and sleeping is elusive at best. Even the pill didn't help much - the pain was about the same, the only benefit was that I was more able to predict when I would start so I could properly medicate.   Today I started this morning and decided to go to work anyway. I thought that, armed with tampons and a lot of pain killers, I could make it through the shift. Nope. I had to duck out about an hour later and go home. Now I'm resigned to once again spending the first day of my cycle doing absolutely nothing but lying in bed and occasionally getting up to use the bathroom.   I feel like my body is holding me hostage. I hate having to deal with this crippling pain every. Single. Month. I hate having to plan my entire life around when I'll inevitably end up starting my flow and therefore be incapable of going to work, school, errands, etc. I'm so tired of having a functioning, biologically female body. I'm seriously considering getting a hysterectomy because I don't want to have to deal with this anymore. Ugh.   TwoX, you are some lovely people, and I'm sure at least some of you can relate. Feel free to commiserate with me or whatever, I just needed to get that off my chest.   Yeah, that is actually bad. But considering that she had a baby at 16 and was in a very abusive relationship that young, she's bound to have some emotional baggage when it comes to relationships and family. At the very least, it sounds like she's becoming more stable, but it would probably help OP and her family in the long run if went to therapy to help deal with that.   Exactly! Asexual doesn't mean no sex drive, it means no sexual attraction to any particular sex/gender. There are plenty of aces with low sex drives or who don't like sex, but that's not all of us and that's okay! Everyone is a little different.   You have no clue what a date is.  Do you know what a date is? Because it seems like you're saying that going out to dinner with someone isn't a date. Also, you say that OP shouldn't be talking about what she wants from a relationship before agreeing to date because that's why we date? What are you talking about? Those sorts of conversations are extremely important, and can happen whether or not you are officially dating someone. You say words are just words, but the fact that OP took extensive time to discuss a potential relationship with her partner before they committed in any way to each other seems like she was practicing good communication skills and took a lot of time to think about her decision before making it. I fail to see how that's a bad thing.   Also, are you seriously going to vilify her for having a relationship that didn't work out? Haven't you ever dated someone and broken up because you weren't really compatible in the long term? That's super common.   I will, however, agree that she should probably take things slow with this new relationship. If they love each other, great, but when you have kids you have to make sure your partners and kids get along, and that doesn't happen overnight. She shouldn't be moving in with this guy until her daughter is more comfortable around him, but she's also said they're waiting a year for that, which could be enough time for her daughter to get used to him, or it could not.   That's fair. It's definitely a complicated situation and a lot to think about. Whatever you decide to do, just try to keep in mind that your daughter's feelings are valid and she's a human being too. As adults we know that sometimes kids are unreasonable, but we tend to forget that as kids our emotions seemed completely reasonable and important at the time. So just try to have a little empathy about the way your daughter is feeling, and it should help resolve things.   I don't think wanting to be married at 21 is unreasonable or unfair, but you also can't force someone to want it too. I think OP was having a compatibility issue - she was ready to settle down but her ex wasn't, they both recognized that and ended the relationship. Now she's with someone who does want to settle down. I don't see how any of that is bad?   I understand it's hard to wrap your head around, it's just exhausting when you're the only ace person all your friends know so you constantly have to play 20 questions when you come out to people.   And I actually feel really similar to the way you describe sex - I'm mostly indifferent and I don't seek it out usually, but I still find it enjoyable for various reasons when I do it. So yeah, it's really frustrating when I'm like "hey babe wanna have sex" and my fiance is like "I do but no, because I don't want you to be uncomfortable"  What??   When did OP ever state her age?  Edit: duh, it was in the title, never mind.  Still though, I really don't think that matters much.   Sometimes when kids get attached to one parental figure but the parents break up, they resent the new parental figure because they feel like they have no control over the situation. It's possible that in her mind, you're taking away someone she liked and forcing her to deal with someone new, even though she never asked for a new parent and didn't want one.   At that age especially children need stability, and your changing relationship dynamic is upsetting that. It's like if she had a favorite toy that she'd played with for years, but then suddenly one day you took it away saying "this toy is broken, have a new one" and no matter how much she cried you wouldn't give the old one back. You're taking away something loved and familiar, replacing it with something foreign and unknown, and expecting her to just accept it. Of course she'll be upset.  Even though you're right when you say that your daughter doesn't get to decide who you're with, she's only five. She doesn't understand that. She only sees you being unfair and refusing to listen to what she wants. And she's definitely not alone in this - a lot of kids (of all ages) refuse to acknowledge a new partner in their parent's life, especially if they've already bonded with the old one.   I think the best thing you can do is to make sure you hear your daughter out. Let her know you care about how she feels. Even if you won't do what she says (because you can't give her everything she wants), it's not because you're trying to be mean or you're ignoring her feelings. You're trying to do what's best for you and your daughter by marrying someone who wants a family, and I'm sure you have plenty of reasons why this is true. But your daughter might not know that. She isn't using your rationale - she's only working off of what her little five year old brain knows. If your daughter still likes your ex and he still has contact with her, it might help to let her know that she can still like him and visit him if she wants. You're not taking that relationship away. If anything, you're just bringing one more person into her life to love and care for her.   Nope, you were totally in the right on this one. I hate the assumption that parents deserve respect just *because parents*. Especially in cases like my parents (or yours, from the look of it) that are abusive, neglectful, or otherwise incapable of parenting. Respect should be earned, and although most parents do deserve at least some respect for taking care of you, if they aren't actually talking care of you why should you respect them?  Your mother is clearly immature at best, and you merely told the truth. The person who told you that calling your mom out on her bullshit was disrespectful because you're her child is simultaneously shutting you down and enabling your mom's behavior. You're allowed to recognize when someone is being unreasonable, regardless of how they're related to you. If you don't question your parent's poor choices or behavior, they'll only continue to walk all over you until it ruins your relationship.   Well fugue states are usually when you disassociate completely from your identity, your brain basically tricks you into believing you're someone completely different, and you live as if you'd always been the new identity your mind creates. So honestly that's not too far off from what you're describing. At the very least I can't think of a better word, other than just dissociation in general   I started a Tumblr blog to vent about my PTSD. Eventually I might share it with my fiance, friends, or family, but I don't think I'm ready yet.   I have PTSD from childhood abuse, and I know how badly it can fuck up your life. It really sounds like you need to talk to your therapist about all this stuff, but if you feel like regular sessions aren't enough you can also reach out in other ways for help.   There are lots of crisis hotlines, support groups, etc. for victims of sexual violence, as well as people with PTSD. You should look online for local organizations like that. A good support group can be a great supplement to individual therapy. It really helps to know you aren't the only one going through something like that.   Also, you mentioned that you and your boyfriend broke up because of your emotional changes and behavior after the trauma. I know you feel like you screwed up that relationship forever, but if you never told him what happened to you then obviously he wouldn't understand what's going on. It can be ready hard to confide in someone about traumatic events, but it might do you some good to come clean to him. Even if you don't get back together, it might help you both get some mutual understanding about what was happening. I'm sure he noticed something wasn't right, and if he knew the reason why you suddenly changed he would probably be more willing to let go of all that.  Another serious thing you should consider is how you're self-medicating with alcohol. I'm sure you don't need me to tell you this is bad. It's tempting to try to drink until you forget, but trust me, this doesn't work. You need to find healthier ways to deal with this stuff. Maybe consider going to AA to help deal with this problem.   Finally, I just want you to know that what happened to you wasn't your fault and your reaction is totally normal. You didn't deserve to be assaulted, and everything you described - from the way you reacted when it was happening to the turmoil it left you in up until now - is actually super common for people who go through stuff like this. I sincerely hope you can learn to love yourself and open up to others again and that you get the help you need. If you want, feel free to PM me to talk about whatever.   I'm panromantic and ace. I'm just really tired in general of having to explain what that means. Also, I'm tired of people assuming that because I'm asexual that I don't like/want to have sex. Especially my partners. I've only been with two people but both of them have expressed that they feel guilty for being horny all the time when they know I'm not, to the point where they would turn me down when I offered to have sex with them. If I didn't want to do it I wouldn't have offered, and if I was annoyed by your sex drive I wouldn't be with you! Geez.   My college roommate had the more toxic variety. His family tried to call the university to get access to his account, which they were denied. Then they called him up personally and tried to bully him into giving his password to them, which he eventually did just so they'd get off his back. He immediately changed it after getting off the phone.   I asked him what the big deal was and apparently they wanted all his account info because they were helping him get loans and were thoroughly convinced he would spend his money irresponsibly. They also believed he was getting drunk all the time freshman year because they assumed he would be the partying type. Mfw he's the most fiscally responsible person in the entire dorm and didn't drink at all until two years later when he became of age.   Oh, cool. I didn't know that, thanks!   Meanwhile the asshat is more than willing to wax poetically about how educated they are on a word they didn't make describing something that will never happen to them so they clearly know better about what it means than the community of people who coined it.   I'm not from Michigan, but the US south. It sucks here for queer people 95% of the time, basically. In my state, for the longest time only one city - the city I currently live in - had a comprehensive nondiscrimination policy. Currently, that number has grown ... to eight cities. Eight cities in an entire fucking state have passed laws so I won't be fired or evicted if someone finds out I'm non-binary. Yeah.  Oh, and even in this, the relatively tolerant city, I have regularly had people harass me on the street because I'm visibly queer. My roommate had people try to grope, harass, or even sexually proposition him so frequently he was afraid to ride public transportation or walk home alone. He's trans. And don't get me started on things my family, former friends, and ex-church pastor have said about the LGBTQ community.   Exactly. I really hate when people say "I'm not a homophobe, I'm not afraid of gays." That isn't the only way phobia is used!! If the fb poster in OP's picture ACTUALLY knew anything about grammar or etymology, they'd know that "phobia" can also mean a strong aversion to something - like how something is hydrophobic if it repels water.   It sounds like you're into domination. There isn't necessarily anything wrong with that, as long as you practice safe, sane, consensual sex when you are with a partner. It's definitely a thing, a thing lots of people are into. And it doesn't make you mean or a bad person for liking it. You should check out some BDSM subreddits (of which there are many) and ask around there.   As far as low sex drive goes, it's possible you're on the asexual spectrum? Lots of demi, ace, and gray-a folks have lower sex drives on average compared to the general population. For that ask around on /r/asexuality.   Yes, it is totally okay not to know! A lot of people go through this, especially in their teens and twenties as that's the time when you're starting to figure out a lot of things about yourself, but it can happen at any stage of life.   What you're feeling is totally normal. There is no right way to figure out your sexuality, it's something everyone has to come to in their own time on their own terms. Try not to stress out too much about it. You'll figure it out eventually. Just go with what feels right in the now, and if later on you settle on something else that's fine, too!   It's very possible that you were traumatized by that experience and you now feel uncomfortable in the place that reminds you of the attack. Not to mention dealing with CPS and other legal issues can be very stressful. I would highly suggest you go see a therapist. They can help you process all the anxiety you're feeling and will hopefully mitigate some of the stress.   Colleges usually have a lot of different volunteer organizations, or various groups that need volunteers. You could start by looking for a general volunteer organization. When I was a freshman in college I joined a service fraternity called Alpha Phi Omega, and we did lots of great projects with the Girl Scouts, the local children's hospital, Ronald McDonald House, and animal shelters.  Alternatively, try starting with something that seems interesting to you or that you personally care about and connect it to a volunteer activity. For instance, if you or someone you know has ever had a medical condition like cancer or diabetes, there are constantly volunteer events for things like that. Alternatively, if you want to be more politically involved you could join an activist group for an issue you can get behind. I have one friend who loves martial arts, and he works for a charity that gives people free martial arts training for those who otherwise couldn't afford it. Another friend of mine loves gardening, and she works for an organization that teaches people about healthier eating and plants local community gardens. Find something you're passionate about and go from there.   That "keyed up" feeling sounds a lot like hyperarousal, but could also be a more general anxiety. It's hard to tell for sure based on a few paragraphs from some stranger on the internet. It's definitely possible you have PTSD, but like I said earlier only a therapist can really determine that. Did you want help looking for resources?   Hey, Alice! Congrats on taking such a huge personal step. Welcome to the sub, we're all petty nice folks here! I'm always glad to see a new face :)   Wow, that is incredibly fucking rude. I'm sorry your gf's mom is being awful, OP. Hopefully she learns that sort of thing isn't okay and this won't be a problem in the future.   Well, recurring nightmares are definitely a common symptom for PTSD, but far from the only symptom. If nightmares and anxiety about a certain thing are the only problems you have this could just as easily be something else, like a phobia.  This [link](http://www.ptsd.va.gov/public/PTSD-overview/basics/symptoms_of_ptsd.asp) has a list of all the symptoms for PTSD in really easy to understand language rather than medical jargon, so it might help you sort out some of your confusion to go through the list and compare it to your own experiences. If you're meeting a lot of those criteria, chances are pretty good you have PTSD. However, the best way to know for sure is to see a therapist and talk about what's going on so they can properly diagnose you.   Well that's what happens when you create an open source language learning software. People make stuff for the languages they know best and care most about, but not necessarily the ones that make the most sense. On the upside, it's the only free program I know of teaching Gaelic.   Yes, feeling guilty is absolutely normal. A lot of people go through this, and you aren't alone. I'm glad I could help, and I hope you get some much needed rest.   Okay, here's a link to a [crisis center](http://www.saccec.org/Services.html) that offers free counseling in your state. Please call them, they have a 24 hour hotline. I'm sure they can help you get the resources and help you need.   I honestly can relate to how you're feeling. I went through a very similar feeling whenever I first escaped an abusive home. My brother physically abused me for about a decade when I still lived with my family, but once I was old enough for college I moved to a new city to get away from him.   I needed to get out for my own health and safety, but I still felt horribly guilty and anxious because I left behind my little sister. She is five years younger than my brother and was only nine years old when I left home. Although I was definitely the main target of his abuse, I was older than him and still larger than him up until I was in high school, so I could defend myself. My sister, on the other hand, was only half his size. I was terrified that after I left he would turn on her, and I had seen him get violent with her before (although rarely).   My step father (the father of both my siblings but not me) was emotionally abusive and whenever I refused contact with my brother he would often use my sister as a guilt trip, saying I was a horrible sister because I wasn't there for my siblings or that she missed me and didn't understand why I wouldn't visit her. I was really torn up about it for a long time. I felt like I was a failure for not being there for her and protecting her when I knew it was not only possible but likely that my brother would hurt her.   At the end of the day though, only my brother was and is responsible for his actions. I was a child when these awful things happened to me. So were you. No one is capable of handling that sort of trauma well, and children certainly shouldn't be expected to deal with that sort of thing. What happened to you was a tragedy. But at the point where you could have warned those girls, you still didn't even fully comprehend what happened to you. So no one should expect you to have been able to save them - you were still dealing with your own issues. That's not your fault. It is your abuser's. You need to get to a place where you can handle your own problems before you can really do anything about someone else's.   Honestly, even if you had said something to those girls, there is no guarantee they would have believed you or that it would have prevented your grandfather from abusing them. Regardless, if they were also abused, that is not your fault. You are a victim. Your grandfather is the only one responsible for his actions.  You seriously need therapy, and I know you said you have some financial/insurance obstacles to that. But there are still resources out there for free that help people like you. What country/region do you live in?   I read an article a little while back about a woman who decided to design a bunch of space-themed girls clothing because she had a similar view   And having that experience would be beneficial for him. But suggesting that OP should just refuse to do anything for an entire week out of nowhere rather than talk about it would likely backfire in a major way.   No, that's called being an asshole. "You don't appreciate me so rather than talking about it like a normal adult I'm going to make life harder for you." Showing him what she does would involve actually showing him - having him spend the day with her and watch as she takes care of the baby and cleans the house and runs errands.   I don't think passive aggressive bullshit is going to help OP out here. She'd be better off making a journal where she writes down all the stuff she does, or having him stay home for a day/weekend while she does errands So he sees where she's coming from.   Perhaps the next time someone only congratulates you for the baby, you could respond with something like "thanks, I'm glad that husband is able to support us with his job so that I can give baby the attention he needs." Make sure you take the time every once in a while to thank him for helping you. He probably feels lonely because you have to spend so much time with the baby, and it might help if you make comments like that so he knows that you still support him.   To me it sounds like he's in a space where he's doing all this work but not getting recognized, meanwhile you do something that plenty of people do all the time and you're getting all this attention. However, what he fails to notice is that carrying a child, giving birth, and raising a baby are all a lot of work. Sure, plenty of people have the necessary biology to have a baby. But that doesn't mean that they are all capable of being good parents.   Being a SAHM is a full time job with no benefits, you don't get paid, you're always on call with no regular hours, and if you fail a performance review you can be incarcerated. That is a big fucking deal. Yes, it is hard to work at a full time job. But he needs to recognize that you are doing a lot of work too, and you shouldn't feel bad about taking some time for your self now and then. Does he expect you to wear yourself ragged all the time constantly carrying for this infant? At what point will you have done enough work to "earn" all the congratulations you've gotten in his eyes?  This is a serious problem between you two, and you need to deal with it sooner rather than later. If this continues, the kid will pick up on the fact his dad doesn't respect you, which means that as he gets older he might not respect you either. Not to mention that parents really need to be on the same page when it comes to discipline on order for it to be effective. At the very least you should talk to him about it, but consider couples therapy if the problem doesn't improve soon.   Funny how much more alarming that looks when you put it in bar graph form   So would it make it better if she was on love with him the whole time? I don't think so. People are allowed to change their opinions of others. She wasn't interested until she got to know this guy better. That happens ALL THE TIME. And there's nothing wrong with two consenting adults deciding to have casual sex.   I would argue that it's better she only had a one night stand with him. Everyone acts as if it's so petty, but honestly if it were me I'd rather my friend slept with a guy I like just the once (which means he is still single and possibly able to date me at some point) than starting a relationship with him which means I would have no chance at all.   That's the plan ;)   Thanks! I've had it for a few days now and I'm really loving it.   I never said the friend's feelings don't matter or that she shouldn't be upset. In fact I said several times that I would totally expect her to be upset. Just not that she should be entirely upset with OP when it's not OP's fault her friend never told this guy she's been crushing on for years that she liked him.   Well for me the bottom line is that OP's friend needs to do something about her crush rather than waiting around for something to happen.  Yes, OP could have been more considerate, but I also don't blame her for sleeping with this dude. Not doing anything about a crush for two years seems to imply that you aren't that serious about it. The friend isn't entirely innocent here - if she had these feelings for that long and refused after repeated urges to act on them, it seemed to me like she was insisting on keeping things one-sided.   Feelings aren't always reasonable, and no one *owes* you their friendship.  This is true, which is why I said that it wasn't unreasonable for OP's friend to be upset for a little while. If I were in that situation, I would initially be upset too. I might be mad that my crush was with someone else, or jealous that my friend was with someone I liked when I wanted to be the one taking him home from the club. But ultimately I would be most mad at myself, for never even trying to talk to him about it. Which is why I think that OP's friend will hopefully get past this. She shouldn't be mad at her friend for fucking a guy. She should be mad for not putting herself out there and making an effort to get what she wants. If you never chase your dreams, the only person you can truly blame for not achieving them is yourself.   Pretty sure this is going to be an unpopular opinion, but I'm leaning toward siding with OP on this one.   It would be one thing if you found out your friend had this crush a week ago and fucked the guy anyway. It would be bad if you did it because you were mad at her and wanted to get back at her by screwing her crush.   *However*, she pined away for this guy for yeeeaaaars. You told her to go for it and tell him how she feels, trying to be a supportive friend. But she still didn't act on her feelings. So when you had an opportunity you decided to sleep with him.   Was this the polite thing to do? No. Is it expected for her to be upset? Yeah. But does you having a one night stand have any effect whatsoever on her eventually asking him out or dating him? Nope. She doesn't own him. You're all adults. If she wanted to be with him that badly she should have said something, or at the very least joined you when you invited her to hang out with you at the club. You snooze you lose.   Honestly if your friend is reasonable, she's going to be jealous and upset for a while but this will hopefully blow over. If not, fuck it. I wouldn't want a friend who sat on her hands for two years and refused to make a move on a guy and then got upset whenever someone else came along and had some fun with him. Does she seriously expect him to not have sex or a relationship with anyone else while she has feelings for him that he doesn't know about? Because that's just unreasonable and stupid.   I personally wouldn't see my SO talking to other people as cheating. Imho, people can't help who they're attracted to and the idea that even thinking about it is somehow cheating is silly. That would be punishing someone for having thoughts or feelings. I have thoughts all the time about doing dumb or inappropriate things, that doesn't mean I'm a horrible person or that I would actually do it. Sometimes it's just entertaining to think about. And I actually talk with my SO about people we're attracted to all the time. Then again, I'm also poly so if my SO told me he liked someone I wouldn't care if he had a side relationship.  The way I personally define cheating is if your partner is dishonest about sexual or romantic interactions with other people, or does things that aren't previously agreed upon. For instance, my SO and I have agreed that flirting with other people is fine. If someone he flirted with invited him on a date or propositioned him with sex, he would have to tell me before he acted on it. If he didn't tell me about it first, then it would be cheating.   Based on my definition, what you're doing isn't cheating because there's nothing going on between you and Jay that friends wouldn't normally do. Friends talk to each other and text. It's not cheating just to have feelings for someone or to be physically attracted to them. Otherwise most people would be cheating on their SOs with celebrities and porn. Of course, many people consider porn or thinking about someone else cheating but I personally see that as rather impractical considering we can't control how we feel, only how we act. But you should still be careful about how you handle your friendship to make sure it doesn't cross the line.   All that said, if you and your current bf are fighting a lot, it's possible that it's contributing to your feelings for this other guy. A lot of people start getting wandering eyes whenever their current relationship is less than stellar, honestly that's human nature. Could it be that you're crushing on him because he's giving you the emotional attention you aren't getting from bf? If so, it will probably pass if you worked things out with him. But if you think your feelings for the other guy are genuine, perhaps it's time to move on and try something new.   I'm happy to hear you got out of such a nasty relationship and are reclaiming all the stuff your ex made you give up. Hopefully things with the new SO work out. Thanks for sharing, and best wishes!   I don't wear them very often, but I've never had problems with heels. Then again I took ballet so I'm used to weird foot positions.   The trick is to walk as if you're walking on your tip toes.   I'm 22, the last two people I went on days with were 22 and 26. They are also three only two people I've dated so there is no third   As a vocalist, I would absolutely love a partner who could sing. Especially one that I could sing with. It would be so awesome! Sadly none of my partners have ever bee musical...   It is not healthy for couples to fight like this, especially over something so small. I think you both have some communication issues, especially if a fight like that escalated so far. If you want to salvage the relationship you will definitely need couples counseling, but I would also recommend both of you getting therapy regardless. You need to learn better ways to deal with your anger and frustrations.  Also, your parents are 100% not helpful if their only response to a fight where you hit someone is "his anger is not healthy." BOTH of you need help, and hitting someone is never okay. If you feel awful and guilty, channel that into improving yourself so that this sort of thing doesn't happen ever again.   On the one hand, I firmly believe that everyone should have the most enjoyable sex and relationships possible, and I think it's usually a good thing when your partner makes a conscious effort to please you. Too many men think that their own orgasms are the focus of sex and neglect their female counterparts.  HOWEVER, like you said, it is possible to enjoy sex without orgasms. And orgasms aren't nearly as important as making sure your mental health is taken care of.   It sounds to me like your bf is putting his own sexual desires and needs above your mental health, and that is not okay. You shouldn't have to have an orgasm if you don't want to, and you *especially* shouldn't have to stop taking your meds (which are obviously important and have helped you manage your mental health!) just so that he can feel satisfied with what you do in bed.   Helping your partner achieve orgasm should be about wanting to please them, make them feel good and be happy. But if your boyfriend insists on continuing sex to the point that it's going to be painful because you can't orgasm, when you tell him you don't think it's worth it, he's not doing it for you - he's doing it because he's trying to prove he is a good lover. And when he says "you should stop taking your meds so you can orgasm" he is basically telling you that his ability to perform sexually, regardless of what you want, is more important than your ability to function from day to day. That's fucked up!  It seems like your bf is really avoiding talking about your depression, but this is a discussion you really need to have, asap. He needs to understand why your meds are so crucial and what your mental health needs are. If he cares about you, then he should care about things that have such a direct and broad impact in your life. And if he doesn't care, then maybe he doesn't care enough about you and you need to rethink this relationship. You deserve to be treated with respect, and people who don't take your mental health seriously aren't worth your time.   Honestly his opinion isn't as important as my mom's, it's not like we're super close. But considering that he is married to my mom he's going to (hopefully) be a permanent fixture in my life, and I would like to get asking with him.   I will probably update after I talk to them about how it went, but it might be a while.   Yes, that's true. I feel like the odd one out around my family, and my PTSD is part of that I think.  You're also right about their sympathies. When I decided to no longer be in contact with my step father, my mom supported me because she had just devorced him and she knew how awful he was. But I can't expect her to completely turn away from her child. And part of why I never really talked to her about the abuse is I didn't want to seem like I was trying to turn her against my brother. But on the other hand, I am her child too and I still want my mom to back me up and take care of me. It's a very emotionally complicated situation for all of us.  As far as her new husband goes, by the time they got married I was already an adult living on my own far away from them, so he just hadn't been around long enough to see why my brother and I have such a toxic relationship. I've severely limited my contact with my brother and so he's only seen me avoid him a lot, never a full-blown fight.   I feel like I heard that fact at some point and then forgot about it, but it is definitely useful and I will bring that up also whenever I talk about it with them. Thank you for taking the time to help me out and your kind words.   Thank you! I'm glad you think so   Thanks!   Thank you :)   I'm glad you think so :)   Thanks! I originally went in for just the color, and then the stylist suggested I go ahead and get my bangs trimmed and she fixed it like that. I like how it turned out.   Fair enough.   Thank you!   I remember the first time I realized I would be relieved whenever my abuser died. You're not crazy, OP - your mother sounds awful and I would feel the same way in your position. Hang in there, I hope you make it through this tough time okay.  	113
 So, me and a friend did some math to determine the age of "Shermy".   The baby seen during the Stan twins' senior year is anywhere from 0-2. Both of the Pines are likely 18.   Now, Dipper and Mabel are 12. This means, since the show is set in 2012, they were born in 2000. This allows us to pin some time quick:  -The author hasn't been himself for 30 years, meaning Ford was lost in the portal in 1982.  -Stanley said they hadn't seen each other in ten years before entering the shack, meaning that they were seniors in 1972, and they were then both 28.  -Little sidestep, this means that Ford and Lee are currently 58, and were born in 1954.  -The baby, who we're assuming is Shermy, is 10-12 by the time Ford gets in the portal (1982).  -By 2000,  "Shermy" is 28-30. Not grandpa age.   So either Shermy's got hella mojo, that's not their grandpa, or "Grunkle" is an affectionate term, making them actually just uncles.   Appreciate any input!   Bill Cipher amiibo or bust.       At my local tournaments, there happens to be a SSB4 Peach main. He won both doubles, and one singles. The only reason he didn't make it to singles the second time was he left early.   Hundreds fear him, and his tag. The one known as PeachBooty.    No problem, I'll just continue my search then. Thanks!   Well, slight problem, my store just sold the last Silver Mario before I got there. Sorry, man.   EDIT: They do have SMB Toad and Bowser, though. If you need either of them for the Pit, I'll take the offer.    Silver Mario NIB for Robin, Pit or Ike?    "That sounds like something normal parents wouldn't allow you to do. Good thing I'm a Crystal Gem. AVENGE YOUR MOTHER, KID! AVENGE HERRRRR!"   Both Doom (616) and Vader (Between V-VI) are interested in expanding their empire, and unknowingly, both have targeted the same five kingdoms:  1. Snow White's Cottage 2. Sleeping Beauty's Castle 3. Cinderella's Castle 4. Elsa's Ice Castle 5. Ariel's Undersea Kingdom  Each has access to their generic army of Doombots and Stormtroopers, respectively, and their usual powers / weapons. In order for one to win, they must kill the other, and all five princesses must be dead. Their army cannot kill any of the targets, solely Doom and Vader can. They travel by air (Doom has a jet, Vader a TIE Fighter), but cannot kill anyone using the vehicle's weapons. No access to any planet-destroying weapons, solely what they keep on them for personal combat.   Each Disney princess has their supporting cast with them:  Snow White: The Seven Dwarves, her Prince, woodland creatures  Sleeping Beauty: Fairies, Prince Phillip, woodland creatures  Cinderella:  Prince Charming, animal servants, could summon Fairy Godmother when crying  Elsa: Anna, Olaf, the reindeer guy, his reindeer, the snow monster  Ariel: Sebastian, Flounder   Will either be able to conquer each kingdom and destroy their competition?   Let's stretch our legs!   Autobots, Rollout!   Present the Puff!    /u/trollabot test_subject6948   I feel like an eventual update could allow for players to choose between Inkling and Octoling, with their hair color changing accordingly.   I'm definitely interested! My priorities are Jiggly, Charizard, Greninja, Lucina and Robin, but I can always go to /r/amiiboSwap and help others get what they need with whichever of these are extras for me. Thank you for the opportunity!    IMO, he's one of the sole all-stars left to add in. With a new game coming out and being important enough to receive an amiibo, I think Chibi-Robo is a great choice.    This is something I personally really want to see in the game.   While I have the Splatoon amiibos, it feels like there's a lot left to desire with them. Compared to other games with exclusive amiibo, Splatoon's addition feels more like hidden challenges than extra support. Something I'd like to see is *amiibo costumes*.  Like Mario Kart 8 / Kirby  the Rainbow Curse / Yoshi's Wooly World, I'd like to see certain amiibo unlock new gear for your character to wear, with special effects. Ideally, there'd be 2-3 pieces of gear locked to an amiibo, and perhaps some kind of re-skin on a weapon, sharing stats with another weapon. Say, perhaps, you have a Samus amiibo. Scanning it in gives you her Helmet (with the Bomb Sniffer ability), the Varia Suit (Defense Up), the Varia Boots (Ink Resistance) and a Arm Cannon designed Charger (with Burst Bombs and a Bubbler).   There's several characters that could really be interesting additions (Mario costume w/F.L.U.D.D. please), and allow for a larger variety of opponents, and more incentive on purchasing amiibos.    Grandpa waited in line at GameStop for me, picked up my pre-order of Splatoon alongside Ness, Wario and Pac-Man, and is dropping them off during my lunch hour. I'm so happy, I thought I missed my chance to grab Ness at MSRP.    TIFU by letting my friends see I posted this on Reddit.    Minding my own business, listening to music and working on my essay in chemistry, my friend pokes me and points out a video. Watching it, I realize he's the interviewee in the video. I reply "Holy shit!"   My music droned out the fact I yelled this. It's bad when the teacher has to hold back laughing.      The Disney Infinity series.   Not because I don't like it, or the figures are pricey, more the fact that it becomes outdated a year later. May end up selling at least one of them when Disney Infinity 3.0 comes out.    I've been dealing with this crap for a while now, and I've been fairly silent about it until now.   Flashback to 8th grade, May 2013. I had everything going for me. I was in high classes for the majority of my courses, just got accepted into the National Junior Honor Society, plenty of friends, a plan for the future, and a loving family. I had some procrastination issues, but otherwise I was an A/B student. Then I got the news that my grandma was sent to the hospital, and the outcome was, most likely, death. I took it badly, shaking and crying. My grandma and grandpa were like a second home for me, I went there after school and did work there, played with their dogs, and had a lot of good memories over there. The idea of not seeing her anymore was devastating, and I was using it to push myself further to make her proud. I finished the year with a high GPA, got into high classes for my freshman year and continued to do things I loved. A slight addiction to Nintendo and the (then-upcoming) Smash Bros. for Wii U helped push through and give me something to look forward to.   As the time went by, my grandma went from near-death to surviving. A few amputations on her leg later, she bounced from nursing home to nursing home. Grandpa, meanwhile, stayed at their house with the dogs, taking care of it and such, a lot more carefree and "fun" than usual. We'd visit him often, mostly over the weekends, and we'd also go to the nursing home every other night or so to see my grandma. While she remained the person I loved, I saw a more bitter side to her. She was constantly whining about how she's trapped here, and I always felt guilty, for no real reason. I'd led to her getting injuries when I was little, but it wasn't what she was struggling with then.  Time went by, little by little, soon freshman year was almost over. I had finished with decent grades, as was expected, and had made a lot of new friends, alongside signing up for AP European History and such. Then came the phone call that changed my life. I was sitting at home, sick from school, both parents at work and my little brother at school. I got a call from my grandma, still in her nursing home, about two weeks from her release back home to resume normal life. She was in tears, asking for my mom. When I  told her they were at work, she began to cry harder. I had no idea what was happening, and had to ask what had happened. Apparently, my grandpa had just called her. He was divorcing her. Before I could call my mom, grandpa called. He ranted about how he was doing "the right thing" and that everything was going to be better now.   What a fucking liar.   After having to call both mom and dad to explain what was happening, I couldn't do anything but sit there and cry. I was freaking out, I didn't know what to do. Once they got home and settled me down, my mom made the decision to help my grandma move into her house, and stay with her for a few weeks to help get her back into where she used to be. My sole mission was to keep my little brother out of the action, and ensure he wasn't affected by any of the bullcrap that was happening. Yet, there was a huge part of me that was trying to fix things. The family was falling apart, and people were constantly yelling and freaking out. I was left in the middle, trying to solve things that I now know was impossible.   As time passed, my brother and I (and our dog) moved in with mom and grandma, as weeks became about 2 months. We'd stay there for a while until grandma was capable of living on her own. Nurse visits, trips to the hospital, screaming phone arguments, everything was just guilting me even more. I became more involved online through Smashboards (a Smash Bros. forum), made friends there, got really high in the ranks and became part of a group of "the best of the best". People really liked me there, it was an escape from the life I was beginning to fear. Fanfictions, video games, developing video games, speculating them, I was engulfed in this world and slowly leaving my own.   Truths began to unravel. My grandpa had been cheating on my grandma since my mom got pregnant with me. Trips to the gym, attempts to "become healthier" were all a ruse to impress this other woman. We found porn, condoms, lube, the whole nine yards in the house.  Soon, we went from a 2-week stay to the entire summer, with our bus routes picking us up at my grandma's place.   I started our sophomore year pretty well, with the exception of AP Euro, which I couldn't focus in. Managed a 3.0 GPA by end of first semester. Home life, on the other hand, was terrible. Constant fights, dealing with grandpa's shit, the constant barking of her dogs, who went from being adorable playmates to terrorizing little shits, etc. At one point, my grandpa tried to take us to court and get custody over me and my brother, as my parents were "incapable and horrible at raising us". It sucked.   Now, sophomore year is nearly over. I am failing nearly all of my classes. I've been diagnosed with clinical depression, and I'm taking 20mg of anti-depressants each night. I can't concentrate, and my addiction to Smash Bros. and it's world has become destructive. I've stopped caring about things, my future, my friends, nothing but trying to escape the real world. Each night, I'm doing plenty of chores, taking care of all three dogs, taking care of dinner occasionally, sometimes trying to do schoolwork and spending the rest of the time on Imgur, Skype and Reddit, browsing for no true reason. My mom is smoking a pack a day, and, when she's not working, is laying in bed feeling sick. My grandma is wheeling around, being demanding and yelling at us about stupid crap that doesn't matter. She attempted to stab my mother with a fork because my grandma took a burger from us and tried to feed it to the dogs, and when my mom tried to stop her, my grandma yelled that "she's trying to help the only ones that matter to her." My brother is remaining oblivious to most of it,  thankfully, but is glued to his Kindle and spends most of the time avoiding his work, making me do it. Dad's at work and only sees us occasionally, and that's driving him mad, and grandpa's with his significant other, doing what he pleases and being cheap on us. I've contemplated suicide once or twice, but I've never acted on it because I know it will only cause more pain to my family.   I'm nearly at the point of giving up. I can't do anything anymore without causing someone trouble. None of my friends really try to help, and my family's attempts to help me have failed. I'm becoming violent, and beginning to obsess over stupid things like those little Nintendo amiibo figures. My life is a mess, and I have no way of escape anymore. Collecting and buying the figures gives me moments of false happiness, as does playing video games. My family is constantly fighting, and I can't do anything to fix it.   I just can't do anything right, and I'm done with it. I don't know what to do with myself anymore.   	21
 Watching the SEA Games broadcast earlier, there was an interview with Quah Ting Wen and Quah Zheng Wen and they were asked to describe each other. Man, all the #siblinggoals feels. They both seem to be really pleasant and easy-going people too.   This sounds like a troll though. But if it isn't, then *shakes head*   However, I have come across a number of fellow Chinese singaporeans making comments like "not that I am racist but Malays are lazier"...(context: when recruiting people I have met HR people and hiring managers that judge Malays just for being Malays even before the interview)  I get very upset at such statements, especially coming from otherwise seemingly civilised "nice" people.    I found 1 in my soup at dinner today, 1 crawling wingless on the dining table and 2 more flying around. Was wondering what they were...   My dad says that they're termites that appear when it's going to rain but...it hasn't rained yet. We shall see...  	3

Therefore you need to either run away or incapacitate your assailant. That's self defense 101, you. I believe you should always try and run, but if someone starts attacking you and you can't easily get away you are completely justified in incapacitating them.    Right?

 HR Super Sports with no ISOs, low as fuck.   But hey man, now you can spend money on your v8. Get some fat meat and lower it. But lower it first. I've seen 315s on stock height, it's not pretty.   I mean obviously we all want 18x10.5 for some fatties.    Trade.    Yooo, and we're both in AZ. Whaaaat!   Ayyyyyyyye! Your ride is wicked too man! I seriously want those wheels though dude, like really bad.   But... how.. D:?   Well ya, m8.   Or, ya know... We held the flags up, then shopped ourselves out.   Orion? lol         I get this reference.   Yeah same here! I thought it was just another "Regular Show", but damn, I was wrong.   If you could check, that'd be awesome. I'm starving over here for some Oreo O's!    And I must say, I never expected to love a show this much. Can't wait to see the new season!   Yeah, I've traded to SK before for Oreo O's.  damn, they went up in price... 2 years ago I got 6 boxes..    Hello! I'm from Arizona, USA. I am looking for a couple boxes of Oreo O's Cereal, and I know only South Korea makes them. I'm also looking for other random Korean snacks as well. Just tell me what you're looking for and I will try! Thank you!   Man, I went to my mom and started asking questions about what just happened. Looking back, I cringe about asking her what the stuff was and why it came from there.   I feel, brother.   My friend drives a Chevy, and we shoot shit about each other.    Fuck yeah, I have experience to comment! Where I worked, the franchise paid minimum wage to drivers (8.05) but after a checklist, you'd get a 50 cent raise (8.55) we made 5% on all deliveries, and only delivered 5-8 mins from the store. Not all that bad, can quickly get deliveries since it's all fast-paced, meaning I could do 12 deliveries in a few hours with 3 other drivers (this was at a slow store) so I'd come home with 30-50 bucks for a few hours of driving. (Though I had a V8 and got 13mpg so it all went to my tank) I wouldn't do it again. Not with my car. Management was good, but I rubbed them the wrong way once and got fired. Oh yeah, and the daily beatifications suck dick. There's a list of things that NEED to be done before the day is over and basically only drivers can do it.   I wouldn't call them Mustang Cobras, SVT GT500 sure, but SVT Cobras are 93-04   Nah, lmao. But that's what people think. ;)   Shitty service after you buy a car tho!!! Lmao   Nah. It's from it being cold. The photo is from around December I believe.   Yeah, right after the bridge.   I mean, I guess man.   315's. GG            Betta try man. Or get a Cowl with Heat Extractors.   No Problem my dude! Enjoy!   What's it like living with a celebrity?   As far as I know, Gibson does exhausts, I do see new wheels on it though.   damn.. lmao, how much did you get?   I think just the emblem alone would look nice.   An exhaust.   I'll bite, 152 FN Orion - which was traded for an FN Road Rash!  And thats wicked, dont ever sell that knife, lol   Staaahp I'm blushing. The photographer is actually my friend named Daniel! Every photo I post is basically his! And hey man. We all started somewhere. I started with a beat up 1995 v6, and I loved it. It just takes a little time and you'll get the Mustang you want! I'm not even close to where I want to be, I'll probably slowly trade this up to Mach then a Terminator. And man, DSG, it really is one of the best New Edge colors, on any model! Again, thanks man. I means a lot!   I just wanna boost it so bad. I could finance a procharger from a member of my mustang club, he works at stage3motorsports, but it's like 500$ a month, or 5k out right. If rather pay my car off first. And thanks man. You always have something nice to say, which is awesome.   I wish I had a Torch Red, so.. Trade? Lol. Thanks man! I appreciate that.   Thank you! That means a lot!   Yeah, my friend focused on the headlight so the rear is blurry. It's not the best photo but it's something different, thanks man! I appreciate it.         Oh most definitely, they are superb at service. Just wish they had Clear Corners..   It's just the headlights, it's about 200$ from StangMods. Though if you go Clear Corner, I'd try to do a Switchback lighting turn signal and HIDs. That amber bulb in a clear light is gonna annoy you. It annoys me so much.   I got them from StangMods. I personally don't like the customer service they have. And I now have water marks in my lights. So rip to me.   I got mine from StangMods, though I wouldn't recommend them. They're customer service is pretty shot.   I'm just dumb, I got it. My b man.   You there man? Whats your steam?   I got water marks in my driver side light now, so its not pretty. :((( Clear corners are wicked though, right?      If only OP would respond.. Lol. If the bread was in the Customer restroom. That's just begging to get in trouble.   Do I think it's gross, sure. But it's covered and unopened, I rarely ever saw us put bread in the restroom, sometimes you just gotta do what you need to do. Lol.   Ex-Sonic Employee here: Mine has done this too, You probably were in the Employee restroom, (Which has an entrance from inside the store, and the outside.) We can't fit all the buns in one room so we'd put them in the restroom that no one is suppose to be in, until we could move stuff around and fit them, or the bread man would take them back on his truck. They're usually there for maybe 2 hours tops.  You probably were in the restroom you shouldn't have been, and no one uses it, at least at my old store, whilst food is in. Plus that restroom looks clean af.    Eh, I sold my first car to use as a down payment on my current car.   Hey man, You won! Sadly I can't trade it since I guess you can't trade unboxes until a week later. :/ But send me your Steam and I'll add you and give it to you on the 3rd! Sorry about the mess, I'm just really dumb. lmao, and you're welcome man!   Hey guys, I haven't done a give-away in a long long time, so I figure I might as well with the new update! [It, as of this moment of posting, is worth about 4$](http://steamcommunity.com/market/listings/730/StatTrak%E2%84%A2%20USP-S%20%7C%20Torque%20%28Field-Tested%29) [This is my profile.](http://steamcommunity.com/id/test_subject7776) Comment a number between 1-1000 and I'll pick a winner tomorrow around 6pm Mountain time. Thanks guys! Have a good one. EDIT: I just realized that since I unboxed it, I can't trade it ASAP, so I will add the winner and trade you on the 3rd of June (1 week from now) That is my fault, I'm sorry.   **GIVE-AWAY OVER, THANK YOU ALL WHO HAVE GIFTED FOR ENTERING**   Thank you man! Flawless everywhere but the usual front bumper/hood.  damn rocks...   Also, I know about my horrendous 4x4 status, I ordered some parts, just need to keep saving for the rest. ;)         Oh yeah. You start to see them everywhere, even when you're not driving. And when they're going the other way.   [The Roush 360R had White with Blue stripes, Looks amazing!](http://www.mustangworld.com/ourpics/news/select54/andrewsdvf4.jpg)   I need those wheels... Good wicked!   Hot, Looks really good!   You won't regret it, Borla's cost a lot, but my god, you are paying for music. And thanks man! I appreciate it, I try really hard lmao.   ye, ye.   It's just Borla ATAKs. I'm going for lowering springs next, then bigger wheels, and then I'll finish my exhaust.   Like sex. It has a drone, but as do all loud exhausts. Borla was definitely the way to go. I have a few sound clips on IG @Lol_You_Looked, it really sounds great when you get on it, in all gears, except 5th, 5th is really quiet.   At the moment, just Borla ATAKs, really wanna try and get BBK LTs and O/R H.   That actually looks very good, god damn!         Bruuuuh, Thats sick af.      If this was my house, I'd cry! It's a beautiful venue for weddings and the such. As we were shooting, 3 Disney Princesses went in. Was very tempting to ask them to pose for the photos. P.S. I might be getting lowering springs.       Thank god I live in the desert!   Booty Booty Booty. How do you like 315's? I want some.   Mineral Gray tho.. ;)   A donation buttom would be 100x better, cause it doesn't hurt anyone, and helps the mod developers.      Friends '15 5.0 got hit in basically every panel and wheel and it wasn't totaled, so I'm assuming you're going to be fine.   Exactly! But winning feels pretty good. ;)   Very very true. But I don't feel too bad for losing, compared to how many mods he has.   It was a good race, we trash talked for a good week before the race. It came down to the wire, but he pulled a tad bit. :P 115.88 a stock motor isn't bad in my book. I just need to work on launching.   [Video of it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZZbYlPzafk)      I think it's a bot. Idek.   [Basically r/Mustang and r/NewEdgeMustang..](http://2015-ford-mustang.tumblr.com/page/10)   lol @ the person downvoting everyone.   I hate when people don't go with reputable exhausts, cause that shit can sound either good, or dog shit. I looked at so many catbacks before getting ATAKs, I was considering Flows or Magnas, but Borla just suits it. I got mine from CJ Pony Parts, But both AM and CJ hiked the ATAK price up.. :( 847$ is a bit much. 800$ is O.K. I have a discount from a Mustang Club I'm in, so I got it for 760$.   [Heres the first ever start-up.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDQGhuYuEpk)   I didn't really notice any difference from inside the cabin, besides when I accelerate.. ;) I would recommend ATAKs to anyone who can get their hands on them.   This is true! I had heard that people said ATAKs on a 2v were too high pitched, but this is perfect.   ;D   Thanks man, Definitely turns a few heads now!         I promise it will. That bumper though.    Good. I'm glad. Cringe man. Cringe like you you've never cringed before.   I can't put it on until HOPEFULLY this weekend. So I thought, might as well do dumb shit with it. So yes, I hit make a sexy pose with it. I made my brother take the photo, please help me. And of course I'll post a sound clip. I'm so excited!   Brb, stripping my interior!   No one needs to talk man! Talking is over-rated. lmao.   * Can we g--- **BRWAAAAHHHH!!!** What? * I said, Can w--- **BRWAAAAAAAAHHHH!!!** I'm sorry, what? * Ca--- **BRWAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHH!!!** Fuck it!   Thats literally going to be my car now. And I'm fucking excited.   Ayyyye lmao   I got mine from StangMods!      Give me the front bumper, and I'll buy you a steak dinner.  	113
 AFAIK they only test thyroid before some specific age if  you have a family history and if you complain about symptoms associated with it.  But been about a decade since I heard that, so rule of thumb may have changed.    Any recent blood work to check for something being off or borderline?  Or family history of anything in particular?  My family had thyroid issues, it kinda came on pretty quick for me.  Blood tests were fine for years, then I was hypo.  What makes it hard is that having sleep apnea basically gives you a lot of the symptoms for other conditions.  Feeling tired, depressed, etc.   Also something interesting to note, like half of sleep apnea patients also have diabetes.  The correlation between them became strong enough that the local hospital paired it's sleep center and diabetes center together.    Have you had your medications evaluated?   Some of them make it worse.  Also after I had a medication change my sleep apnea improved, I suspect it was thyroid medication related, but I also had a diabetic medication change about the same time.  I dropped like 4-5 in pressure from one or both of those medications.  Might not help, but never hurts to throw it out there and see if there's the possibility.     Maaaaybe.   *drool*   Uhhh, maybe he's afraid of his friends trying to steal you away.  Dinner plates always meant nipple size being extremely large on the boob.  Not seeing that here, you have nice proportions.    Im concerned Ill be alone forever.  Oh and Im allergic to shitloads of stuff outside and mildly allergic to bananas.  But Im OK with the banana thing, I think guys look silly eating them.    Requesting more, with less hands.    Oh and one of the reviews about these places said that the people trying to recruit you make a "bonus" or some sort of rate for suckering people into it.  So you can pretty much guarantee they will be bullshitting you.    Closer mirror with better lighting.   You're too attractive to hide back there.    I only understood about half of what was going on in that.    Oh it's eats my soul up not having had a girlfriend, etc.  And I just read a post about how the guy was seen as a pariah until his "hot" girlfriend showed up to meet him for lunch.    That made me wonder if that's why people treat me oddly.  http://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/392px2/its_kind_of_shitty_how_important_it_is_to_have_a/  That's the thread I was referring to.     If you were gay you could at least say they were being discriminatory toward you because of it.  If you just had an ugly girlfriend, you'd still be in the same boat.   Your 20s?  Im 36, same boat.  The less you care about it at your age, the more likely it is to happen.  Weird phenomenon, no idea why it's attractive to women.    Must be interesting on St Patty's Day.   Wondering if that green shirt is your "boobs out" shirt.    I found this to be pretty good information.  My main issue is just trying to feel like I'm worth doing anything positive for.  And the fear of having things go really sideways and being worse off than I am.  It's a lot of ........mental barriers/blocks and/or fear driven logic in my case.  Reinforced by years of history that supports that I'm not worth it (in my mind at least).  But this post is helpful, if you want to post more in comments or send me some things that you find helpful I'd be receptive.  Can't guarantee I'll enact them, but I am always looking for things that "click".    Had a number of "Sales" people contact me from Monster.  If you actually look into them you'll find you work on commission and that most people don't make much if anything at the job for months and months.  Probably a complete waste of time to contact them.    More accurate perhaps, but not perfect.  It still doesn't cover things like stress, exercise, if you are sick, what you ate.  All things that have to be recorded and detailed by the people wearing them and a lot of that is perception based.  Then you have water intake......other conditions you may have, does the equipment interfere with things you may do regularly?   My thinking on it is, that it's so varied that we need genetic level testing and tracking so that medication/diet can be weighed against the genetics at play.    Won't happen due to cost, but that's my idea of perfect data.  It really goes down to figuring out what works for you and hoping your doctor isn't set in the mindset of "The guidelines say this, so we must do this"    What are you writing?    Not hard, but if you are worried about your window falling apart you could always build a little wooden box around the AC unit to spread the contact weight to the box instead of the sill and closed window.  They are very easy to install, but heavier than a fan.  If your house is kinda old or has a poor electrical wiring job it might flip the breakers when the compressor kicks on if it shares a circuit with anything major.  You want to buy something big enough to cool the room you're putting it in.  Otherwise you'll have issues with it.  I had a frigidaire unit for about 4-5 years now, remove it during winter and clean it before putting it back in every year.  Not the GREATEST fit with the window in terms of blocking the heat leaking in around it, but it gets the job done.     Agreeing with this.  Depression basically sucks the positive feelings right out of you, you can be numb/neutral/bored/"fine"....    And you tend to forget all the good feelings associated with past things.    According to some diabetes classes I've been to, they have revised their guidelines in the last few years and have data showing that it may still be "incorrect".  Even WHEN you exercise can affect your results.    Personally I think they are guessing at it a lot of times because there's just no way they can get perfect information from all people with diabetes.    Normal primary physicians likely aren't willing/able to deal with it unless it's just a straight up medication change/adjustment/addition.  So be prepared to be referred elsewhere.   Sexy, cute, adorable.  First picture is probably my favorite.    Very hot.   It wasn't unissued, they just only run them for so long.   Humble bundle site is just a really good site to keep an eye on anyway....various game/book/comic book, etc bundles.    Yeah, these pictures keep getting better and more interesting.    The creativity really stands out.    I dont know the age you're dealing with here.  But even as an adult I think I would appreciate someone buying me a pi with the breadboard stuff and a book on ideas/things to do with it.    Something I wanna do when time/money/etc works out.  They recently had these "maker" books on humble bundle, it had a pi book and some other things in it that were interesting to browse.  Unfortunately that bundle sale is now over, but it might give you some ideas.    And really nice hair.   	30
 When I read about the pictures, all I could think about was how some victims feel like they aren't good enough, or that they can't face their families or loved ones. But your explanation makes more sense now.   So tonight is the new moon. They will be going down the rabbit hole tonight. Keep them in your thoughts, everyone.   Isiah, Holly, and Caleb, we are rooting for all of you.   Soooo......... Do we get another update? At least one explaining why you're immune to the mold and to Hadwell?   This is the only one that gives me pause. The use of the radio. Only because in GoF, Hermione explains that there is too much magic around Hogwarts, and it would interfere with any sort of electronics. I'm pretty sure that the cameras they are using are older models that don't have any electronic parts. As to why they haven't incorporated any other Muggle tech into their world is because their homes would be too infused with magic (as similar to Hogwarts) and they would fry the electronics. The Hogwarts Express is a steam engine, one of the first trains invented, and therefore has no electronics.   Hope this helps!!   They could've used the spell that either Crouch or Amos used in the beginning of the book as well. It would've shown them the last few spells Harry used, and then they would've seen that he didn't kill Cedric.   Honestly, I think that even the Ministry couldn't find a way to justify Harry being the killer. They knew that if they did that, the rest of the Wizarding World would've known Harry was telling the truth, because he's the Boy Who Lived.   She's my girlfriend and she's a small part of the problem. I need to talk to her about it, and I will. I just don't want to .  As to why I don't want to exist, I couldn't tell you. Again, I'm not suicidal, I just don't want to be anymore. Like I just want to be empty. I already feel like a living shell of who I once was, and I wish I could say it was the first time.   I laid in bed last night, and all I could think about was how I wanted to be anywhere but there. But then I thought about staying at my girlfriends place, and that thought was also unappealing (that one being a first, I've never not wanted to stay with her). So I started thinking about other places I could go to crash, and nothing sounded good. So I opted to stay in my own bed, but it just felt wrong. It didn't feel like the bed I've slept in for the past few years.   I wish people would give me random HP quizzes.... I have an arm completely devoted to HP (tattoo sleeve) and no one ever asks me anything.   I just feel like I don't want to exist. Not suicidal, just like I don't want to be anymore. I want to be numb, to not feel anything. But I also don't want that, because then that would still be existing. I don't know what to do or think, or feel. I need a lot of help right now, and I feel like I can't turn to the one person I used to be able to turn to, because I don't feel like she would actually care. But I know she would, and that she would do anything to help me. I just can't bring myself to talk to her about it.   So I feel like there was an update between this and Holly's 40 Nights in Hell. Can anyone link it for me? I feel like she gave us an update wherein she details when Jude told her about the portal. I could be wrong, and if I am, please let me know. I'm going back and rereading everything to see if I can pick up clues to help them.   I would actually suggest rock salt versus sea salt. Much more pure, much stronger at keeping evil at bay.   Hope you and Holly are still safe.... I know we are all worried about you.   Yeah. He was always really creeped out by them. We found like this dead animal down there back when we were kids, and he swore up and down it was a human body and made us leave. Thats why he would never go with me again. Thats.comforting. Wow. Relax. It was just a dog or something that fell in and got stuck. I felt bad for it but it definitely wasnt a dead person.  Guys, Caleb knew what this was.... This is why he freaked out so much. He knew way more than he initially let on.   Caleb, if you're reading this, sorry to call you out like that.    Guys, all I have to say right now is be careful. I know the new moon is coming on soon, and I don't want you guys to end up hurt or dead.   Also, Holly, be careful the next time you meet up with Lucifer. He seems somewhat trustworthy from what I've read so far, and all the lore I've ever read about him seems to state that he doesn't lie all that much. He does on occasion, and I do know that most true Demons don't lie. They may leave some stuff out of their deals with humans, but they don't lie. Angels lie. A lot. Just tread with caution.   I had to swipe on either the top or bottom of my computer to do so, but I have a touchscreen. I don't know what you have, but maybe try googling it?    Everyone knows that reddit reaches across the veil to the other world just as easily as I'm typing this out. We've all seen the ghost stories :)   Isaiah, when can we get an update from your time gone? I know I'm curious as to what happened to you for sure.    How long ago was this?   What the fuck is in your car with you?! Update us quickly, OP!!  	18
 I go after what I want. Why should I wait for someone else to make the first move if I have my own expectations!       Go Cyclones!!!    My parents grew up here (New Holland). It's like my second home. What a beautiful part of the country! Can't leave without getting Achenbachs. (and smelling the "fresh" air)    Fifty Shades of Ebola   The brand is "Printed Duck".       Don't forget the bacon!!    Oh I didn't know it had been posted before! I just stopped mid bite when I noticed it and took a pic!       Iowa State University  Record high enrollment and ran out of on-campus housing.    Michael Buble: "Everything" - he smiles when he sings the line, "you're from outer space" and it makes me melt.    It is sturdy. Feels like something that would be used for a throw pillow. I liked it because it seemed thick enough that I wouldn't need to line the fabric so it wasn't see through.    It is from hobby lobby. Next time I go there, I will write down and post the brand.    Thank you!   Thanks!  	16
 So here's some context. I am in highschool (I am 18) and i was staying a friends house, safe place to smoke, one of my buddies just got an RDA rebuildable ecig. I had some dabs and thought hell these would work on the ecig. I took one huge rip, then 2 decent ones. I pretty much collapsed on the bed and instantly at a [10]. After a short period of time everything started warping and I got dizzy. At this point it's about 8pm and like 30 minutes after the dab, I started tripping, straight up tripping. I saw dinosaurs that were like holograms and rainbow static there was also a screen of sorts that had some alien looking language on it that was controlling with my hands. That happened for about 30 minutes, then the worst thing happened, I vomited up everything I had eaten all day. Including Indian food. I am currently still high [4 ] over 12 hours later so my typing may be all crazy.   I need concentration not energy. But I'll look into it.   I had an Adderall script for a while. But I'm trying to avoid another one.   Well I've taken 600mg 2 days in a row. Still no effect.   I'm a student. And you think I want to be lazy? I'm trying to find a way to solve it, by asking who I thought had some concept knowledge on the subject.   So it doesn't matter how the word was intended to be used, but only how it was perceived?   5 hours now. Absolutely no effects were felt.   What are site confirmed to have fake adrafinil? And what exactly does adrafinil really look like? I bought 5 grams from powdercity and it's a very pale pink color. The reason I ask is because I didn't feel anything after 600mg dosage.   Any help is appreciated.   Concentration and being more alert  	9
 Getting really annoying.    Not technically TESD but Bryan's guest spots on Smodcast 85 (Side Chair) and 207 (The Bryining) are particularly hysterical. One of the only podcasts I've ever listened to multiple times.   No         Confirmed fact vs Allegation.    Plastics   As much as being a judgemental dick was part of yours.   BEADS   Beads?   "I Know Things Now" is one of my favorite songs and with the way they're altering Red and The Wolfs dynamic, I can't see it carrying the same weight going from "I was just raped" to "I just met some dude who was kinda mean."    Studio wants Sondheim and the brand recognition.    No no, as with most things, needs more wolf penis.       "Love love love the books Mr Martin but instead of cutting neds head off maybe joffrey just sends him to his room for a while and he doesn't get any candy or anything like that but maybe we check in on him every once in a while and he's totally on restriction and stuff but that gives us a chance to have him make a comeback later."      Took me six years for my second attempt but I was always a bit slow.    On the one hand that's awesome because everyone's alive, on the other hand Who the hell let's an 11 year old play GTA?!   But you would say in either situation it's more difficult. Just genuinely curious, anecdotally. Like even if a father is well versed in how the female body works are their struggles when dealing with puberty/menstruation, ditto for mothers with sons?    I'm working towards being a screen writer and my father, not raised in the most enlightened of atmospheres, has said he thinks I should do a story about the challenges of a same sex couple raising a child of the opposite gender. I didn't think that would be that interesting as I didn't see that there would be that much difference from a regular couple; he thinks issues of sex and puberty would be more difficult to go over without a member of the opposite sex. What are your experiences? Is it that different from your heterosexual friends or is my dad completely off base?   Kev, First off thanks for all that you do, the pods and the flicks have been a huge influence on me. Second, This is a tired ass question but very important to me right now so if you'll allow, I write screenplays with a partner and we're nearing completion on a few we're pretty satisfied with. I know you're all about the get a camera and do it yourself and we would love to but we don't have the money, time, equipment, or talent pool to draw from. If we're going the "old Hollywood route" what's our best bet for getting our stuff out there and maybe getting some representation/work?   Surprised I haven't seen this here but Jaws. Chemistry is just perfect.    Literally says who it's by right at the top dude.   Actually speaking as someone who works in a customer service line, I have no idea how things work at Comcast but everywhere I've ever worked our priority has always been handling customer calls as quickly and thoroughly as possible. If you don't have a monopoly on a certain area of business your goal is customer satisfaction.    Don't know where else to post this story so I'll try commiserating with yall. I ordered a year in time portrait for my mother On Dec 2nd from the website www.plowhearth.com/ after a little over a week I emailed, and received a response stating i had to allow 3 weeks, which was not stated anywhere on their site. After another week and a half I called and was routed to the shipping department (bad sign.) The shipping department said they would leave a message with Service and I would receive a callback tomorrow. This process repeated itself three more times up until today, where they said that it had shipped fedex direct and no tracking information was available. So my gift for my mother has yet to arrive with 30 hours to Christmas. Do not order from plow   hearth if you need your order inside of a month apparently. So reddit, what's your story?          Sorry, this is the hundredth time you've seen this today I'm sure but I just want to say I found your depression post about two weeks after I was diagnosed. You were an amazing help in getting me through the early stages and explaining what I was feeling to my family.   No questions just, you're awesome.  Also I sent you an email like a year and a half ago that I later realized came off super creepy so... sorry about that.   Keep getting better.    I ever so humbly apologize for daring to post a video I happened to miss a year ago. I was working under the foolish assumption that there might be people who exist who missed it or perhaps weren't even members at the time. I beg your forgiveness.       I'm not sure if you're trolling or a moron but if you're a moron: It's playing on the joke of Joel being the reluctant parent figure that makes up the first two thirds of the game. [This is to set up the third act reversal in spring where he finally accepts her as his daughter right after her innocence is lost after the near rape](/spoiler) Grunting and gasping is just indicative of the brilliant sound design as when humans have to climb, run, and haul things, they grunt and gasp.  If you're just trolling: Carry on.    For the past few years I've pretty much just gotten gaming news and reviews on my news feed from g4. Since they are shutting down, what are some decent review and news sites that I can look into?   Posted on your last AMA, hoping you catch it this time. Can you settle an argument between my friend and I? Do you consider the ending of Clerks 2 to be a happy ending, or do Dante and Randle realize that they regret the purchase of the quick stop?      We live in Tallahassee FL, and are looking at cutting ties with comcast but do not want to loose internet speed. In terms of customer service and internet speed, how do they compare?            Posted on your last AMA, hoping you catch it this time. Can you settle an argument between my friend and I? Do you consider the ending of Clerks 2 to be a happy ending, or do Dante and Randle realize that they regret the purchase of the quick stop?            Then leave. People like you make reddit so much worse than the things you complain about   Can you settle an argument between my friend and I? Do you consider the ending of Clerks 2 to be a happy ending, or do Dante and Randle realize that they regret the purchase of the quick stop?   How? How is this a problem? Just move the fuck on. It does not effect your life, it takes you ten seconds to realize you've seen it before an move on. I haven't so I laughed.   	45
 Okay.     Me? I'm okay I guess...   This probably isn't the best example, but it's the only one I can really think of right now. To give you some context, I was at work and I was really struggling. It was like I wasn't even there, like a zombie. I worked through the motions of what needed to be done but I barely even have a thought to what was happening or what I was doing. It was a bad day. Anyway, I knew I had to do something, or else I would go home to an empty house and continue to feel empty and bereft. After work, I called up a friend I hadn't really spoken to for a couple of weeks; he's always up for anything and loves to explore. So, I asked him to pick me up and I directed him to an abandoned railway tunnel I had found near my house when I was younger. All I really told him was that I was having a bad day and needed to DO something. The railway tunnel is covered in graffiti you see, so I picked a blank space and added my own graffiti: 'I am alive'. After that I decided to hang out with him and his friends who I hadn't met. While I remained pretty melancholy for the rest of the day, just doing something so out of the ordinary shocked me. It brought me out of the quiet, dark place my mind had gone. It was almost like I had been holding my breath and had finally remembered to breathe again. I'm not saying you should go out and graffiti or anything. Just do something like calling a friend you haven't spoken to in a while. Go for a walk somewhere you're not familiar with. Explore.    Thank you. I'm surprised by the comments I've received. I didn't really realise that there are other people who feel the same way as I do. Sometimes, I do try to make an effort to go out and do things, even if they're on my own, but more and more lately I find myself just opting to stay at home. I feel like I only make an effort because that's what I'm supposed to do. It's my responsibility to do my best to get better.   I wish you luck with your meds. Don't be afraid to talk to your doctor about trying different ones if those ones don't work for you. And give them time to work I guess. And you're right, they don't give you back the 'meaning' in your life, they only even out the emotions for you so you can find/create that meaning yourself. It's hard and it's frustrating but it's possible.    I've been there too many times, I know what you mean. It just gets harder and harder to break free from the almost cozy darkness. Loneliness, for me at least, is so familiar. It's easier. I try not to let myself get into that kind of thinking, but I guess sometimes I just get so tired of having to try so hard to be 'happy'.    I understand what you mean. Sometimes, I find myself getting lost in the moment and enjoying myself, but not as often as I'd like at this stage in my recovery. More often than not, everything seems so meaningless, like you said. I guess the only way to try and not feel like this is to do things that shock you into feeling...so doing things outside of your comfort zone. It's what I've had to do a few times...but it doesn't always work :(   Definitely the live version of Latch by Sam Smith - he's an angel    I'll make sure to! I'm just watching the second season of Yahari Ore no Seishun Love Comedy wa Machigatteiru at the moment (and loving it!) so that's next on my to-watch list! :D   I think it's hard to say. On one hand, it's hard not to think that any friends you make who are also depressed are simply there for the pity party. Misery loves company. Speaking from experience, putting a group of depressed teenagers together eventually creates a somewhat toxic, but understanding environment. People who are going through the same thing as you won't judge you, and will be able to understand you on a level most people won't be able to. However, it's a sad truth I've come to understand that it's hard to recover alongside someone else at the same time. For me, their recovery became more important than my own. Their depression almost ratified my own, making it a real and tangible part of my life.   	9
 http://www.buzzfeed.com/lorynbrantz/12-ladylike-responses-to-the-most-annoying-things-said-to-wo?bffbutm_term=4ldqpg p#4ldqpgp   Thats the article I got it from :)      ....what? How do the two even relate to one another? Threatening to break up the family unless you do chores while on crutches?  Okay...   All of my what.   I really should. Shes tried to contact me to tell me shes "praying for me" and that she forgives me. First of all, if youre praying for me, i dont need to know. Second of all, forgive me for what?? Im not the crazy psycho abusive person here.     I think it looks great, actually, judging from the picture you took of your profile. If you want your septum to show a little more, maybe request that your jewelry get changed to something longer?    Haha i honestly do not know.   EDIT: Thanks everyone for your responses. I want to give you all so many hugs...   I have a couple that come to mind.  "You're an evil, spoiled, ungrateful brat. You should be ashamed of yourself, because I am."--don't even remember what I did, but i was 9 years old.   "Fuck you, then. If you want to be a failure, then fine by me. I don't need you. I have four other kids."--said to me as a junior in high school after I got two Cs on my report card. She was basically forcing me to help raise my four younger siblings while I was enrolled in all IB classes, and I was depressed and was not getting any treatment. The five other grades I had were As.   "What is wrong with you? Can't you see you're making a spectacle of yourself? You just want attention! Go where no one can see you!"--We were at a family friend's 30th anniversary party and I had broken up with my first long-term college boyfriend the day before. The couple's first dance came on and I shed a couple happy yet sad tears.   "I'll assume you were sexually assaulted. That sucks. But you need to stay here and work on our relationship, you do not have the right to leave whenever you please and do what you want. I am your mother and you live in this house. No daughter of mine will live in sin."--after I tried to stand up to myself over winter break during and tell her I was leaving to go live with my boyfriend and his family because our house was a toxic environment. I told her that while I was away at college I was diagnosed with a couple mental illnesses, and that I had some traumatic things happen to me, and I needed a different environment so I wouldn't go overboard and kill myself. She still hasn't said more about it than that. The worst part is that she worked in a sexual assault crisis center as an ADVOCATE and she has helped countless people get counseling and support. My little sister was sexually assaulted and Nmom pursued legal action against him for two years. My mother was sexually assaulted as well and has traveled to different conferences speaking about it. My brother is depressed and she got him on medication and to counseling right away. But of course, all my depressed symptoms happen because I'm dramatic, lazy, and attention-seeking. Projection, much?   "Yeah and now I have to take off of work for this bullshit. Shes so dramatic, I wish she would grow up."--I overheard her say this on the phone after I had an emotional/nervous breakdown of some sort. She kept trying to force me to hug her and made it worse. I kept screaming no at the top of my lungs but she wouldnt let go of me. I was a crying, PTSD ridden mess. Later that day, when I tried to leave to my boyfriend's house (again) she called his mother (I was 19 at the time so WTF??) and told her "You're gonna tell her that she can't live with you. You've never seen the other side of her, the one where she won't hug her own mother. She's awful."   "I rebuke you and your evil ways! Get the fuck out of my house! Ungrateful! Selfish! Whore! Live in sin, for all i care, I wash my hands of you! You're dead to me!"--said to me after she beat me and screamed at me for ten minutes this Christmas Day for suggesting the men get up and help us out. I went to my boyfriends house, where I now live with his family during breaks.   I'm sure she's said more horrible things than that to me. These were the more landmark ones. You know how narcs are, they will say tiny things that cut into you that you can't really explain to other people because you come off as petty otherwise. What's the worst thing your narc's ever said to you?   EDIT: Edited for chronological order and to put in a couple more things.      Oh my god, I am so sorry for the loss of your baby brother. This is absolutely disgusting. As a person who almost lost my little brother to suicide as well, I don't know how you didn't fucking rip her vocal chords out so she could never say something so incredibly insulting like that ever again. What mother fucking says that about her child, "how could he do this to us?"   I hope you're doing okay, my heart goes out to you.    She has no right to be asking for handouts, as you've indicated that she's done, and I don't know her particular situation, but she sounds a lot like my own mother. I am the eldest of five children. We were raised on her single income. We were poor when there was just us three kids, but she had two more. (Incredibly stupid.) The difference is that my mom got a degree, and made barely enough money to keep the electric on every month and to be independent from handouts from the family.  It doesn't excuse your sisters behavior at all, but this time she is going through right now is super rough, even if its brought on by herself. It's going to make it even harder to pick herself up because she hasn't made anything of herself, she has three kids already (depressing as hell), and she has a bun in the oven that was put there by a father who can't help her out.   You have a right to be frustrated, as she has made some very stupid decisions but its pretty hard to get out of the kind of hole she has dug herself and it doesn't sound like she has the moxy to do it. Just trying to come at it from a different perspective to help you with the anger you're feeling, justified as it may be.   I don't remember eating Honey Nut Feelios today   Well, I wouldn't sit there and try to explain yourself, because they have already made the stance that anything she does, you should try to maintain a relationship with her because "She's your mother!!"  This is a logical dead-end for them. I say stick with the succinct response you offered just now, and if they don't support you, and are going to attack you anyway, you don't really need them either, since they'll be stressing you out even more, no matter what you say to them.   You know, the fact that you're even agonizing over this, over someone who has hurt you a lot in the past, shows that you are a good person who is still able to try and see things for what they are, instead of twisting them around like Ns do.  Also, most people desire a relationship with their families, ESPECIALLY after they have kids of their own. You're not some fickle, bratty, hormonal teenager who doesn't appreciate their parent. I don't think that most people on this subreddit can say that they didn't wish they had more "normal" parents that they can go to for advice, emotional support, or things like that. The fact that you feel something is wrong, and need to create more extensive boundaries with someone who is flesh and blood says something.  The sad part is not many people understand this, especially with the subtle (to other people) abuse of an Nparent. Please, do what is right for you and for your daughter. You have dealt with your Nmom for your whole life, you know her games, and you know how to avoid participating in those games.   What I'm saying is, trust yourself, and don't let the family push you to do something you don't feel is right for you.    If you would like, you can go read the post I am referring to right [here.](http://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/2z4vum/mother_apologized_i_had_my_suspicions_and_now_i/)  Anyway, after not speaking for nearly a month, I get a text from her saying "Your on my heart today...hoping you have a really great day!"  After the initial cringe at the improper use of "your", I got incredibly angry. I was in class and my heart started beating really fast and I couldnt focus for the rest of the time. I was swept right back into the time when I was living with her and dealing with all of the awful things she said and did to me.  Im also angry because she fucking ignored me the last time I saw her when she hadn't seen me or heard from me months after she (quite literally) kicked me out of the house on Christmas day.   She doesn't get to fucking pretend that because she apologized, she can just go around pretending that that was enough. She needs to act like she is sorry around me.   And im fairly sure the only reason she texted me that is so that she can show all her crazy church friends how ungrateful and horrible I am when I dont respond to it, perpetuating all the lies she's probably told them.  Ugh, even getting a text from her gives me the heebie jeebies but I have to keep her number in my phone because its the only way I can check up on my siblings.   I like this a lot, even more because it was written by a mother.   To be fair, that's some pretty good blending. What makes it awful is how white and prominent her highlight is, and of course, those eyebrows.   this is really clever lol   Awwww *hugs*   My whole life, I honestly did not know that I could go through life without becoming a mother, and I'm so glad I found this subreddit before I went and had kids.   See, I love kids, but there's a difference between enjoying them when they are at their best, and actually raising them. I believe many people, like me, confuse the two.  When I first came here, I organized it by "top posts of all time" and just started reading for hours. I was amazed. I never had the desire to actually ***raise*** children but I didn't realize it until I came here. (Or become pregnant, which is another terrifying matter all on its own.)   It sounds silly but you all saved my life. I now know that I am childfree, and that means I have freedom, finances, and my identity, which sadly, many parents lose when they have kids. Thank you all!     I was walking to class this morning, and there were two girls behind me talking about going home for Easter. The conversation went as follows:  * Girl 1: Are you going home for Easter? It's so stupid for our spring break to be a different week than Easter weekend, but I'm going anyway because obviously, that's family time.  * Girl 2: Yeah, I am. I don't think Julia is though. I mean I get that she has a psycho family but I would never ever miss a holiday, why would you do that? It seems kind of selfish.  * Girl 1: Yeah, I totally agree, I think she's blowing it way out of proportion.  These girls sounded like her roommates, and I feel really bad for her, knowing that she's not going to have any support from her friends to get away from her possibly toxic family. I was in the exact same position with my family last year, and spent Easter with my friend's family. I really feel for you Julia, wherever you are. :/   You should submit this to /r/tifu lol       Annoy: When the teacher is condescending. I love some good ol' sarcasm, but there's a difference between being funny and being an asshole.  Respect: Is patient when I come to ask questions all of the time. I've had professors that were visibly annoyed that I came to their office hours all the time. What are you doing teaching if you don't want to teach??   I have younger siblings, so I asked them all to give me a random word and this is what they came up with.   I was devastated when it was brought to my attention that I could have been named "horny green alien" instead.    This is unrelated but god damn your username is giving me some serious cravings    No, i wasnt, but still. A kid making loud huffy bored noises and touching books with their dirty snotty sticky fingers is still not okay   I dont understand how people can have such poor judgement.  In that second case, the manager was definitely doing something illegal if those kids were in the US. The manager would never hire a kid that young so why would you let a kid work that young??      I'm sorry to hear that :/ I hope as the years come you will be able to find more peace   Thanks :)    Yeah, I'm just waiting for that day when it will stop disappointing me so much.   Im on mobile so I dont know how to post a link, but you can go back into my post history to find the "apology" my Nmom gave me about a week ago.   Anyway, after all that i told my mom i was going to come see my younger siblings yesterday, and she was super pleasant on the phone, everything seemed fine. She told me she wouldnt be there that day because she was getting her hair done (microbraids, so it takes like 6+ hours).   Well i showed up around 5:30, and she gets home about 20 mins later, and goes straight into the house without saying hi to me and my bf, and sits in the house while everyone else is outside talking and playing with the kids.  Eventually we go inside and she doesnt even acknowledge our presence until we say we are going  to get going, to which she says, "Oh, bye."   Now i know i was right to be suspicious. I have a feeling she only apologized to save face with her church friends and because its the lenten season.   Also, to add insult to injury, she told me she was going to give me the car they never use so that i could drive to work/go grocery shopping/get back and forth from school, but i showed up and it was gone. They sold it and are going on vacation with the money.   Fuck it, dont want your shit anyway, Nmom.   Very true   Thank you, this is very helpful. I think I'll use this model for myself in the future :)  	35
 Me: I like rock, hip hop, kpop.. Annoying person: GANGNAM STYLE!! Me: NO.   nope, scotland I'm afraid :)   FYI - I'm scottish.   Where would I even find someone who wants the same? Obviously I'm not advocating moving in with someone after the first date but that's where I would like to be by this time next year at least. Is this weird?   When I was in school I overheard a girl telling her friends that her mum once sat in the bath and squirted milk from her breast into the mouth of her baby who sat on the bathroom floor. She was adamant it was true. Mocking ensued.   Ah merci! Quel est tue e-mail? PM   je ne bien parle pas en francais mais je parle en peu.   	7
 I hope you don't either man. I just have run out of ideas. I wish I could find some magical cure that can make me happy but I don't think there is one. And unfortunately, it doesn't give me much hope.   I know exactly what you mean. An accident that resulted in my death sounds terrific. I want to fade away into nothingness   I just want to be able to laugh, you know? I want to be able to play video games and go outside and have sex and be happy while doing those things. I want to be able to find things enjoyable, and when I dont, I don't get the point of living. I would give anything for the meds and therapy to work and make me better. I would sell everything I have and become a monk if that somehow got rid of my depression. I would do anything   Hey! Would love to join. IGN: Anon_Agon   I didn't compile the list myself, and it's quite possible some items might be wrong.   True! I didn't make this list, I just posted it on pastebin. Good catch.

 That article is really interesting! Thanks for all your comments. I understand much better now. :)   Or SNES for that matter I suppose.  Thanks!  ETA- Thanks for all the insight everyone! I have a much better understanding now. :3   FUCK YOU OLLY   NICE getting Mario and Luigi when I get home. :3   This looks like the game I want. :D   Yeah there is one for the university I work at. It seems to be geared towards students but maybe they would see me. I've been trying to figure out how to make an appointment without using the phone but I guess I'll just have to call them tomorrow. Thank you for your insight   The only medical person I have a relationship with is my OBGYN. Never got a GP since I moved here. : Gotta take care of the ladybits tho...   Nah. We didn't see bodies did we?   Which makes them main characters then, right?   DO YOU KNOW HOW LONG HE CARRIED THAT WATCH? EVER SINCE NAM, AND IT WAS NOT IN A PLEASANT ORIFICE.   ... really?   Crying for you ;-;   Uwaaaah that Ekans chu. 0-0   Black NN3DSXL, Blue DSi, Pink DS Lite, Cobalt GBA SP, Arctic Purple GBA, Yellow GBC. All still working just fine. :3   Her hair and clothes burnt off and she was entrapped in fire to the point where everyone thought she was dead. That was how I as a reader interpreted it.   ADWD Chapter 52 disagrees.   I feel like someone as attentive to detail as you would really get a lot out of reading the novels.   Ew. That sounds mighty unpleasant.    Daario.    The only reason the Chief ever lost a round of darts.   Oh that's a great suggestion. And thank you I will!    I was totally going to get them that until my bro said they were not going to Dublin. That failure prompted me to ask here. :)   He suffers from Gout. This is mentioned a couple times in S4, but not really made a big deal of like it is in the books. I bet lots of people were wondering.   White Walkers probably can't freeze the ocean but [ADWD](#b "wights can SWIM").   Those are some great ideas! :D    They will be in the southwestern part of Ireland for 13 days starting about August 5th.   Getting info from my bro is like pulling teeth but they aren't planning on going to Dublin apparently. :( Thanks for taking the time to make a recommendation and they definitely sound like awesome things to do!   Thank you that sounds awesome (to me, but then I like tourist trap stuff ehehe). I'm definitely considering that.   Hey that sounds fun! Thanks! :D   They are flying into Shannon and want to visit castles and such in the Southwest area.   Thanks! Will do.   My brother is getting married in a couple months and he and his fiancee are honeymooning in Ireland.  They have asked for wedding presents to be monetary contributions to their trip.  I'd like to keep to their wishes, but in a way that will make my gift be more memorable and meaningful than an amount of money going into a pool. I'm looking for museum tickets or special excursion passes that I can pre-purchase for them and give to them at the wedding.   Please share recommendations! Thank you!   Also I have been informed they intend to stick to the southwestern parts of the country to see greenspace and castles.   Wow! Glad you're doing better!   I'm sorry to hear that. :( Hopefully my body will! I have never tried anything but combination pills before so here's hoping.   Good news! Thanks. :)   I suffer anxiety too. It's never as bad as we think it's going to be and always better if you come clean sooner.    Thanks   LSH?   Oh no ;_;   Definitely!   He told me I had to make extra sure to take the pill at the same time each day.  He switched me because my blood pressure was a little higher than it was a year ago when I was first prescribed the pill.   Thanks!  (Also how bout those new guidelines saying get a pap every three years if you're over 26? Heck yesssssss)   Pokemon Conquest maybe. I never hear anybody talk about it and it's so much fun.   Also, Pokemon Ranger.    They didn't have to build campfires. Ramsey did that for them.   Well probably that it was sooooo up close and larger than life and she was riding it. That's what I thought at least.   Stannis' face in that show was that of a broken and desperate man. I knew right away what he was going to do.   Didn't he and Jorah glimpse a dragon briefly when they sailed through Valyria?   I'm guessing it has something to do with LP size records first coming out in 1948. That probably made it easier to distribute songs for home listening, like say at a holiday party.   He's a person and his name is Chewbacca.   It's my new favorite movie. I thought it was incredibly inspirational and one of the most creative movies in a very long time.   I mainly research Civil War POWs, and there were a few anecdotes in this podcast that stuck with me.  1. German POWs in Aliceville had so much food they buried the extra to get rid of it  2. American officials treated the German POWs so well because they feared retaliatory treatment of American POWs (but then continued after they discovered how American POWs were really treated).  It's amazing how 80 years, a World War, and an important treaty changed ideas towards POWs in this country. For those interested in reading a modern historical perspective on POWs in the American Civil War, I recommend [While in the Hands of The Enemy](http://www.amazon.com/While-Hands-Enemy-Conflicting-Dimensions/dp/0807130613). It's very critical of both sides and their treatment of POWs.    My Japanese DS games (Jump, Taiko) play on my NN3DSXL.   37   I think that looks awesome!   That would be so 90's throwback, especially in clear light purple. :D   If you go to the game in the Eshop and click repair, that may fix it. It did for me.   It's beautiful inside and the meal (lunch) we had was delicious. :) It made me happy to be there!   /u/iscuck_bot test_subject9096   [Here is a good biological perspective on why kissing is important](http://www.wired.com/2009/02/kissingscience/)   A really nice metal tool box is an AWESOME gift for an archaeologist. I love mine. 3   [I always recommend Death by Theory](http://www.amazon.com/Death-Theory-Tale-Mystery-Archaeological/dp/0759119589)  It is a great way to introduce yourself to archaeological theory and how attitudes about it changed over time. It's also a quirky mystery novel!   Aww yay anthropology :) This was my first post in this sub!   	61
 Absolutely.  Whole foods are always the safest way to go. :)    Be careful with this. Maybe your school is different, but when I was in college the online info wasn't accurate.  I worked in the dining halls and even though cooks are supposed to follow recipes,  sometimes they'd alter them. Add a little extra oil, or if we were short on an ingredient we'd substitute it with something else. Or the website wouldn't get updated and calorie counts would be off. It's a nice guide, but in my experience not extremely accurate.     Just because someone doesn't want a dog and doesn't want to deal with them doesn't make them lazy. People can not want a dog, and still have healthy relationships with people; people who will live longer than a dog.    Had potato soup last night. Don't have an exact recipe.  Bus basically it had potatoes,  carrots,  broccoli,  little bit of cheese, little bit of half and half,  chicken broth, and some random seasonings.  I've started making creamy soups with part cream and part broth and it turns out tasty for less calories. :)     Not sure if this is the type of thing you're talking about, but check out www.walking4fun.com   Sargento also has a line of "ultra thin" sliced cheeses that range from about 40 to 45 calories a slice.    I always buy the zero calorie sprays. I think if you spray for a few seconds it's 0, but if you spray longer it's a couple calories.    Thanks for the recipe!  I love overnight oats :)   Thanks!  :)   Could you explain this pumpkin ice cream?   Haven't lost anything in my boobs, or if I have it isn't noticeable in the way my bras fit.    Love the flatout line of tortillas,  flatbread, etc.    Also king Arthur flour has a blog and recipe index with lots of good easy bread, cracker, tortilla,  muffin, etc. recipes.     I tend to switch it up. But I recently came across this sourdough recipe. http://www.reformationacres.com/2010/12/whole-wheat-sourdough-sandwich-bread.html but I cut out the brown sugar because I wanted the sourdough flavor to be stronger.  1 ounce of the bread is about 70 calories I believe.   I also recently made a banana cashew chocolate bread. I can't seem to find it right now. But basically take your favorite banana bread recipe and add a handful of chocolate chips to the mix. Then spoon half the batter into pan. Mix cashew butter with a bit of oil to thin it out, and pour over batter. Pour rest of batter into pan and use knife to swirl the butter throughout the batter. So yummy.    I'm a big time snacker. Especially where I'm currently working. Lately my work lunch/snack has been:  3 ounces baby carrots (35 calories)  2 ounces low sodium deli meat (60 calories)  1 ounce block cheese (120 calories)  1 serving of dried fruit (about 100 calories)  114g low fat cottage cheese (90 calories)  Piece of homemade bread (about 150 calories) - could bring crackers or granola bar or something else.    I think that adds up to about 550 calories.  Which is basically my breakfast/lunch.   If you're into actual put together lunch.  Cottage cheese mixed with tuna in a lettuce wrap is my go to and high in protein.    To my boyfriend's dismay, my butt went first too.  Wish we could pick where to lose.    Had some leftover crusty buns I made, but didn't know what to do with. So I made this for brunch today. Turned out very yummy. Thanks for the recipe!  :)   Think they were talking about StealthRR.    I had 4 taken out at once as well. I was told not to use a straw because the sucking could mess with stitches,  so keep that in mind with smoothies. I ate a box of mac and cheese. Typically that's not low cal, but if was the only thing I ate. Just test that it's cool enough with a finger if your mouth is numb still. I was starving after they were removed and couldn't wait a couple hours to eat.    Your breakfast sounds yummy.    Thanks I'll try it next time :)   Is the Buffalo rub super spicy?    Thanks. Good luck :)   I started with similar stats. F24/5'5"/165 lbs. Now I am at 148. I've been logging calories on my fitness pal for 87 days. Haven't worked out much. I play pick up volleyball at the local school once a week. And try to go on walks, but haven't done any serious workout routines. I eat between 1200 and 1300 calories a day. Definitely track calories. It's the only way to lose.    "Heres what happens: Grapefruit contains furanocoumarins, which block an enzyme that normally breaks down certain medications in the body. When it is left unchecked, medication levels can grow toxic in the body.  Its not just grapefruits, either. Other citrus fruits such as Seville oranges (often used in marmalade), limes, and pomelos also contain the active ingredients (furanocoumarins), but have not been as widely studied."   -WebMD.    Most nutrition information for meat is for the raw weight. Unless it specifically says cooked on the nutrition label.     Looks delicious!  Love finding new ways to eat cottage cheese.  :)   Weight always trumps number of pieces. With canned items a lot of times the juice/liquid is also included in the count. If you have canned corn or beans, the weight is based on the liquid as well.   I was looking on their website and couldn't find anything.  Thanks for the idea!   Just looked at your breakfast post, looks delicious to me. :)   Exactly.    I'm a cashier on my feet currently,  but soon will be back working in a kitchen.  Play volleyball once a week, and walk or bike everywhere.  I aim for 1200 but on days I play volleyball I eat a little extra. For me this is temporary for weight loss.  When I reach my goal my TDEE will be about 1500.    I might do that.  My TDEE is about 1700, just hate having maintenance days because the weight loss is slow to begin with.    I would just eat 1000 calories there and not eat lunch, but the same day we are going out to lunch too :/    Awesome thanks :)   Thanks :)   	36
 I'll try that, thank you. Sounds like exactly the kind of thing I need   The biggest problem is actually building up the courage to even try.    I didn't hear anything so I have no idea, but there were definitely a crazy amount of emergency vehicles running around right afterwards    My mom just came in, talking about how she thought she heard fireworks. A few minutes later, all kinds of emergency sirens were sounding from all directions. Did anybody see anything?   Ren and Stimpy scared the shit out of me as a little kid.   	5
 Civilisation is death. Turn based games are usually bad for me, but that one has literally taken weeks of my life.    You're either an existing redpiller who is advertising for the sub, or you're very, very naive.    So what's your job? You'd better be an astronaut or you are one hell of a cunt.    The goal of the conversation is to enjoy the conversation. If you're willing to spend ages having a boring conversation just to get laid, then you're way over invested in sex for the sake of sex, and you need to start expanding some other areas in your life. E.g being more than a walking penis, and treating women like more than a walking vagina. Why would you ever want to be with someone who isn't interesting to talk to?   There are only two numbers on the hotness scale. 0 - people you are not attracted to, and 1, people you are. If you desire to have sex with them, do it. If you're worried that other people will say you're not with a girl who is attractive enough, then you need serious work on your inner game and not caring about what other people think of you.    You're making the massive assumption that you can't be popular and get laid at the same time. All of the most popular men I know are drowning in the pussy, because women are above all attracted to social status. Far from being totally separate, the person you are describing would be the person who gets laid the *most*.   How the fuck do you define a 'WoW 10?' Someone with cooler swords and stuff than the other girls?   I am greatly looking forward to this.    Yes.    Blogspam   Well done mate, keep up the good work.    she's trying to fit in with her group  That's not a valid reason for anyone outside of preschool. Judge away.    Seddit usually has a strong reaction against female-authored posts, with the whole 'fish teaching a fisherman' thing, and I usually disagree and advocate for them because they have merit.   This one, unfortunately, proves the stereotype. There's a lot of stuff in here that's worthy of tumblr tween relationships and not much else. It breeds insecurity and counterproductive mindsets. Take it with a very large grain of salt.    if you walk like a wealthy man, you must be a wealthy man  Are you implying that an arbitrarily larger number of digits in a bank account magically causes peoples' hip rotator muscles to habitually contract? Or is it the massive weight of that credit card that makes them walk like a retard?   Since when do all text conversations start out boring?   Have you ever actually met someone who threw out clothes because they were 'out of fashion' after a year? Because I never have.    I'm pretty sure at least 95% of the people on Tindr downloaded it out of curiosity.   ASD   Suppressive fire, don't let her outflank you   Aragon had serious oneitis. Could have been spinning that HB 8 plate Eowyn the whole time. She's such a feminazi with the whole "I am no man" thing though. /s   Best answer: try it yourself and see if it works.    Assuming that maths is the only measure of intelligence  Further assuming that someone who is good at maths will make for intelligent conversation - which is what OP is looking for - more so than someone who reads classic literature   It may be for you, it isn't for some other people.   That's not because you're good looking or more muscly or whatever. For some people, 'romantic' behaviour - flirting, interpreting signals, displaying interest in the opposite sex, etc - just doesn't come natural at a base level. These kinds of people need to learn the long and hard way. And often being the kind of person who is very rational, intellectual and analytical, it most suits their natural talents to go about learning how to do these things in this way.    Ignore this guy, he's a fucking retard.   You're really fixated on this aren't you? You seriously don't believe that women can appreciate someone for anything other than their looks? You have no evidence that people do anything 'in general,' and you've said it yourself - you can think of tons of exceptions to the rule. You know what that means? It's not a rule.  Dude, for your sake, you need to go an read a LOT more inner game stuff, because these beliefs are a) extremely shallow and b) fucking you up.  Edit: you're also fixated on 'opening' my eyes.' Why should I, or anyone? If any male on this planet who is butt ugly is capable of pulling hot girls, why should he 'open his eyes' and give that up for your theory?   I can think of three guys off of the top of my head who are dating way outside their physical range. One of them is a real shocker and his girlfriend is fucking hot. So I guess you're the one kidding yourself.   Also, as things to be paraded around go, I's much rather models for the sub than something like the Mystery Method or anything advocating negging, which is where the sub gets its false reputation of being all redpill. Which understandably turns people off.    It has been repeatedly, endlessly proven that inner attractiveness is more important for men than outer attractiveness.   Judging by this comment, your inner attractiveness needs some work, because you've got some limiting beliefs.    Such advice, many seduction   Guise DAE redpill   To be honest, I'm not sure that it was ever good advice. It taught you how to get women to have sex with you, yes, but it was by using lines, routines, negs, memorised bullshit; a fake personality to trick women into having a one night stand with you. It *worked* at the time because wholistic, life-appreciative approaches to pickup such as Manson's hadn't been developed yet and there was no alternative. But I still wouldn't recommend it.    Mystery method is crap, you want Mark Manson's 'Models.'   This might help. It helped me.   http://www.nicknotas.com/blog/meet-women-during-the-day-easy/   I don't think they would even judge you. It would probably be envy along the lines of "I wish I was the one asking her out/I wish he was asking me out."   Or: take said text as an indicator of your success, ignore it, and keep going.    unlikely to change  There is no such thing. Nothing about your personality is nailed down. Nothing about is anything other than what you decide it is. Right now you are deciding that your personality sucks, and that's all that will come out in your behaviour. The first step is to decide that you are a good person, and as counterintuitive as it sounds, you will become it.    No it's not! I've worked hard and progressed steadily with every workout I've done, with the exception of one or two. I steadily added weight in exactly the way I should have - about 2.5kg per workout. Not 100kg at a time. That's fucking stupid.    I should mention that he's tiny and that's almost 3 times his body weight   That's like telling someone who wants to be an astronaut to go to space to get some experience.    Don't tell me what to do.   Well done for owning up to not approaching, well done for actively trying to beat your AA (even if you had a little setback), and good luck tomorrow. Let me know how you go. You're awesome.    Yeah sorry, I was adding supporting evidence to your case.    Thanks man! Good to hear that all this feeds into fitness as well as other things.    Congratulations man! Keep up the good work!   Noob here. When I started I was deadlifting 20kg (40 pounds) - about a quarter of my bodyweight. After some work and dedication I am now DLing 70kg (140 pounds) - slightly less than my body weight. Now, or at any stage of that process, if someone had told me to try DLing 160kg (320 pounds) I would have very seriously injured myself. That is not a mental blockage or lack of effort.   Edit: My PTs DL is about 180kg and he's been training for 14 years.    Can you explain some of what those changes were to me for my education please? Sincerely, a noob   You say you're balding and overweight? I'm moderately overweight (about 28% BF) and, as much as I know that I shouldn't care and be more self confident, I'm struggling with it. I'm lifting four times a week and working with a PT, but that isn't going to show for another four months at least, and in the mean time I'm really struggling to approach and display genuine interest because I don't see how any girl could find me attractive. I'm a university student, and for all of my advantages - fairly smart, high achieving, good sense of humour - there's always other guys who also have them and are ripped.   What have your experiences been like with women when at less than 'average' physical attractiveness? How old are you? Is it different after uni when less men seem to be in good physical condition? How did you learn to not care about your body or face? Do you find that you need exceptional inner game compared to the men around you to make up for it, or is it more or les equal? How much do girls ACTUALLY care at various ages? I realise that having muscles and a low BF% is always an advantage but that doesn't happen overnight and I'm fucking sick of being single. I want to start working on game now, not in six months, because I feel like I'm wasting time and potential effort/knowledge/advancement.   I realise that's a lot of questions, don't feel pressured to write me a book. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.    "This video is not available"   I'm not very good looking. Think Matthew Lewis (Neville Longbottom) in 2006  Is having sex with random attractive girl like two hours later   now she's unconscious and in my van   Was really hoping for you in a car with a bug on the windscreen   Have you gained significant muscle mass? That would probably account for the weight similarity.   Sweet holy jesus   This is extremely well written. The dialogue and description quality matches up with most professional authors, as well as the narrative flow and structure. If this was you, OP, well done.    Now that you mention it, is moving out one of the steps too?   Source?   The question is, where do they go?   Precisely.   Sidebar please.   Maybe it wasn't in the US.    the fall of the Greek empire can be attributed to hot showers  As anyone who has ever opened a history book could tell you, this is such A-grade bullshit that I don't even know where to begin. How about the fact that there was no such thing as the 'Greek Empire?'   Ah, I see.   Are you sure that the non-dominant hand does the holding of the arm? I'm right handed, and I always hold my left arm with my right hand when I cross my arms. I just did it then.   I could become as outcome independent as I like, and someone being cold or standoffish to me if I'm being friendly still would strike me as irritating or rude. No, don't be *upset* by the interaction or let it affect your happiness, confidence or sense of self-value, but there's nothing wrong in being irritated by someone being rude to you.   IMHO the whole point of Models is that you can be an attractive 'alpha' male without sacrificing your morals or being a dick to people, so at the end of the day, as long as whatever you're doing doesn't affect your happiness, confidence, or ability to give value, it really doesn't matter. Be nice to people who don't deserve it if you want to. You're then the bigger person.    Aww shucks. No one has ever called me handsome before. Thank you.   ... this is both what I want to be and my idea of a perfect day in a relationship.   Thank you!   Thank you! Looking back on my younger photos, I almost shaved it all this morning before I posted, but now I'm glad I didn't.   Thank you so much for this comment and for giving such detailed feedback. I really appreciate it. I've only lost about 8kg and I've probably got another 7-10kg to go, so I guess good things are in store. And that's quite true about my nose, I'd never thought of it that way.   You have no idea how much this comment means to me. I don't think anyone's said "you're quite attractive" to me in my life. Thank you.  P.S. I also have always thought that I had ugly eyes the colour of sewerage, there's something new.   Public transport, after a long day at work. Headphones on. Stare out the window. Bliss.   I'm definitely not an expert, but the folks over at /r/malehairadvice and /r/malegrooming are.   Dude... at least rotate them the right way up.   Got rejected yesterday. I'm 20 and I've had one girlfriend, which lasted for a month before she cheated on me. I'm trying hard to be confident and outgoing, but I can't help but think it's because it looks like baby me's face got run over by a tractor. Give me tips on things to change? Beard or no beard? Without facial hair it's hard to believe that I actually have a jawbone, so i've been rocking it for about two years now, but I'm not sure. If there was one thing I could change it would definitely be my nose, I want to chop it off. And then replace it with one half its size. Been going to the gym for about a month and a half, no change yet but I'm working on it, still have about 10% body fat to drop and a lot of muscle to gain before that looks decent.   You're not getting any pictures of me smiling, I have braces at the moment and it's definitely still a work on progress. I know that looks hideous so there's not much point making anyone else endure it.  Me at the moment ([front](http://i.imgur.com/x2oxBE7.jpg), [side](http://i.imgur.com/l7qbxV7.jpg)), just got out of bed, had a pretty average haircut yesterday.   [Me two years ago, with no beard](http://i.imgur.com/gEkthbW.jpg) - keep in mind that this was a professional photoshoot and it has been touched up, I just don't know in what way.  [Also me two years ago, in desperate need of a haircut.](http://i.imgur.com/O3lQCFW.jpg)  [Much older one of me \(around 16 y.o.\) looking dashing in costume.](http://i.imgur.com/8xk3P1E.jpg)   On top of what the others are saying, I think you could use a better haircut.   I was thinking a bit of Robert Downey Jr  	75

 Two Black Cadillacs- Carrie Underwood directed by Nancy Meyers   How To Get The Girl- Taylor Swift directed by Elizabeth Banks    His career has been in the tanks for years now.    I just came home from work and a neighbour that I never met before  wanted to speak with me. He asked where has my father been because he noticed that he hasn't seen him in a while. My father died 7 months today from a four year battle with pancreatic cancer. This is the first time when someone asked where my father was and wasn't aware of his passing. It's a really horrible feeling, I've been dealing with his loss in a healthy way (getting help , finding hobbies etc), but it made me miss my dad more. The neighbour though told me when he first moved onto the street, my dad was one of the first people to greet him, it made me smile. Sometimes, curses can turn into blessings!    I'm so sorry for your loss. I just lost my father last December and my stupid cousin was on snap chat while we were at the cemetery and apparently took a picture. There are a lot of shmucks (idiots) out there. Since my dad's passing, I realized who were my friends and who arent. I stopped being in touch with one friend because she wouldn't seek help with her fathers death and kept on guilt tripping people and wanted attention. You are upset and honestly it's not worth it. Focus on yourself and you should find yourself new friends     You are in high school, you have your whole life ahead of you. Your age, you start to have your first relationships etc. He is 34 years old, his age get married or start popping out babies by then. What do you guys even have in common besides being both humans and both sexual attracted to each other? Nothing. 18 years different has been done before but it's different when ones in high school and the other one is almost two decades older.    YOU CAN DO BETTER   From a Jew to that co-worker: SHMUCK    I agree theres a lot of plot holes, I just binged watched this show in 3 days and now I have to wait till 2016. Okay so I find Lexa/Clarke kiss so fucking random. Maybe I was still on season 1 and I went on youtube to be told that Finn dies and she hooks up with Lexa. I'm not against it because its a same-sex kiss, I just think its so random or its' just me   She has the right to know, it is her decision to decide not yours.    NOPE, its normal    You shouldn't date anyone that you will be only attracted to if they change. Won't work and will make you look like a dick.       Dump them both    People judge without knowing what's it like. They assume they know everything when actually they do not.    I recently went through a similar thing. My friend lost her father suddenly and is not grieving in a healthy way. She's more interested in getting a boyfriend than getting help. I stopped being friends with her because i lost my father just a few months after to cancer. She freaked out on my friend because she told her she needed help because every time the word heart or attack came up she would bring it up that it reminded her of dads death so  i knew i had to get away. You can only do so much   Your relationship with your mom is not healthy. Your mother bullies you and it affects you emotionally. Honestly, I would remove contact from your mom because she's really toxic.    SAY NO    Pancreatic cancer sucks. My dad died recently from a 4 year battle.   Live your life till the fullest. This is YOUR time to do whatever you wished to do.    My father was diagonsed cancer 4 years ago and recently passed away. It sucks, but cherish every memory you have with him.  Focus on yourself as well.  It's a lot to handle, I'm 21 years old and so many of my friends fathers are well and healthy.  You need to be there for your family and your father  but most importantly you   :)   Honestly, it doesn't matter what they think. It matters the freindship you have plus I'm speaking for myself but I would think that's a bonus since I also have a gay friend and knowing that the person isn't homophobic is a plus.    750 dollars! That's her mistake, she needs to be more careful.    wireless headphones i think would be the best option    It won't work out.    Block her everywhere and if she comes again call the police. You may have to order an restraining order against her    2 months, and she wants you to spend $7,500. I think she wants to move a little too fast    Death is apart of life, everything eventually dies from plants, animals and humans. No one knows what to say until they are the ones experiencing it.  Everyone deals with it eventually, but unfortunately, some deal with death earlier than others. My father died recently on December 8, 2014 from a 4 year battle with pancreatic cancer. Besides my father being diagnosed with cancer 4 years ago in 2010, this was also the hardest day of my life. But, I can sit and cry for years on how my dad was taken away from me at the age of 21 and how he won't be there for my birthdays or my graduation in 2 years or if I walk down the aisle. My father was the one who cheered me on with school, went on ski trips with, bought technology with (phones, printers) and went to Tim Hortons so he could visit a camping store nearby. My father wasn't my best friend, but he was my mentor who I looked up to and who was my light to my darkness. I've been battling depression for a year now and it's hard, but knowing my father would want me to continue my life as it was before he died and succeed. I want to make my father proud and I will.    I'm a student and things spread like wild fire. It doesn't look good if it comes out that you are sleeping with a student and you slept with more than one. Hope its worth it.    I don't know if this is serious or not, but your reputation is at risk. You'll be known as the teacher that sleeps with the students and not for being a good teacher. Be smart    I think it will also bomb because it was supposed to be released earlier and there was so much hype about it and now it was pushed back to 2015 people are more interested in 50 shades of grey and Oscar noms    I'm very sorry, I recently just lost my father after a 4 year battle with cancer. It is not easy what you are going through, its mentally, emotionally exhausting. Every day I wish my father would walk through the door because my dad was always a fighter and when he passed it still hasn't hit me. I know that he is in a better place because seeing him in the hospital unconscious killed me. You need to associate yourself with people who will be there for you. This will be a time where you see who your real friends are. I would also recommend you see a professional, although you may think you don't need it. There's nothing wrong expressing your feelings to a professional. I like my social worker, she tells me I'm awesome.   Keep your head up high   It's hard I know, but you are not facing this alone    I'm still a virgin too and I'm 21 years old turning 22.  I mean I could go on tinder and loose it anytime but I'm not that kind of girl. There's nothing wrong with that    Clint Eastwood  I would say he's work is all over the place in my opinion. He has some great films such as Million Dollar Baby, The Changeling, but then he has like Hereafter and Jersey Boys   Thank you, I'm currently seeing a social worker.   Oscars/Emmys/Golden Globe do make a difference. Because they are referred as  for example ''oscar nominee/winner___'' when the person comes on stage to present an award or to announce the person before the interview starts.   Also if the person has been nominated, they use it in trailers    If you could bring back any previous guest who would it be?   I hate to say this but KARMA!!!  A) You gave tons of money to some person who you don't even know  B) You cheated on your wife   Sorry pal but you deserved it     It's nice that he cares about his brother, but he's out of line completely and does not understand it.    Okay if someone was posting online how big my boobs are, I'll dump that asshole. My boobs are only for me and whoever im seeing.    Don't message the girl, she's not worth your time neither is your asshole soon to be ex husband. He was the one who was supposed to be committed to you.    Yes and no I'm happy indie movies are being recognized  but im not happy with the lack of diversity    She is thirty and has been married 3 times.  She should pay for her own. Look I may be 21 years old but there comes to a certain age where a parent does not pay the bills for the child. She's taking advantage of you and you and your husband need to put your foot down    She shouldn't be putting rules down, that she can't follow as well.    Honestly, he said he would drive you and you said that this has happened before. He isn't worth your time.    Im sitting in class listening to my professor repeatedly say mental health problems and this is not the first time I disagreed with a teacher's choice of words. I have a hearing loss and instead of the teacher saying that I have a hearing loss, she decided to use my least favourite words hearing problems.  Im trying so hard not to raise my hand as well as to rebuttal the topic. I have depression and anxiety which makes my life sometimes a little bit complicated, but I do not see it as a problem. There is a lot of stigma revolving mental health and as for someone who is trying to educate us, using problem and mental health in the same sentence is doing more harm than good. A problem is defined as something to fix and mental health cannot be fixed. There is medication as well as therapies to help assist with mental health to make it easier for the person, but it doesnt always help. The reason Im writing this is because mental health is not a problem and by saying that makes it seem that I as well as the many others have something that needs to be taken away. The topic Mental Health has been brought up in many conversations, advertisements and media outlets, but there needs to be a CHANGE on how WE talk about mental health.    Sorry your sister had to witnessed that.    Sorry i barely read it.   	46
 I was with you up until you texted Betty.  She's obviously a shit head and Adam is a giant douche canoe but the baby didn't do anything to you, you shouldn't wish difficulty upon it (and honestly with parents like them it's going to have enough difficulty, I'm sure)  Other than that I think you are justified in your reaction and plan. I say go over to the house, get EVERYTHING out of there that you might want (jewelry, Mrs Snuffles, etc) and plan on never going back. Don't give Claire any money for the baby shower/gift. She and the rest of them can figure that out.   And don't text Betty again, block her number/email/Facebook. Do it to Adam as well and throw your mom in while you're at it. I would totally and forever cut Betty and Adam out of your life and only consider talking to your mom again if she apologizes and seems to understand why what she did was COMPLETELY fucked up.   Good luck.    So I'm single again for the first time in about 12 years.   I'm trying to put myself out there again and I've arranged a date for Thursday.   I'm excited but pretty nervous. I haven't asked a girl out in forever (I'm pretty stoked she said yes) and I want things to go well.   I need some advice:    I was planning on taking her to play some Mini-golf and then maybe get some dinner after if things go well. I wanted something fun and not a cliche (though I do love dinner and a movie) and I thought this set up would allow for good chances at conversation.   Is this a good idea? Should I stick with something more traditional?  Also, should I bring flowers or is that too corny?  Tldr:  I'm going on a first date with a new girl after my divorce. HELP!!   Definitely do not 'suck it up' until the fall. You need to be clear with him that he is still responsible for certain things.   With him making money (for now) and you doing the majority of the chores things seem pretty balanced from an outsider's perspective. But if either of you aren't happy with the arrangement then they aren't balanced.   You guys need to have a discussion and both lay out what the arrangement will be and if there is a discrepancy between your individual expectations then a compromise must be agreed upon.   That is the way you avoid resentment.   Honestly, if I were him I would be happy to only have to take out the trash.   Oh, and the dishes thing I feel like shouldn't even be negotiated. That's just a thing that adults do, they clear their fucking plates. C'mon guy, seriously.    You sound like a very caring and sensitive person and I can understand why you would be upset by her actions. That being said you should listen to your fianc and (future) FIL; this is not your fault.   You should have a talk with your fianc and tell him that you're removing his mom from Facebook. Also, I would suggest setting a precedent now about dealing with family drama: he deals with his family, you deal with yours.   You don't owe her an apology or explanation. If something needs to be said, let him do it. Though he shouldn't be apologizing either, only saying that her actions are not acceptable.   As far as the trip/honeymoon, for now I would assume that they aren't happening. That sucks but if you plan for them to not happen (ie, start saving/planning for one you can afford) then it will be a pleasant surprise if his family comes through. If not, well, then you're no worse off.  On another note, your fianc sounds like a good guy and that he knows you very well.   Good luck.    Maybe getting him excited beforehand would work.   Send him some sexy texts/pictures, tell him you want to have sex later, let him know that you're excited about it.   You mentioned that you're afraid of him just going along with you because you want it and he won't really be into it. I suggest getting him started and he WILL be into it.   Also, getting him excited and anticipating might make him more willing.    Got mine yesterday!   Suspicious because I would wonder what caused her sudden change and I don't know that I would automatically believe her explanation. I find that this level of self awareness is rare in people and I would be expecting every minute for her to start treating me like shit again.   I am not your husband but I can tell you that after years of living with a verbally abusive (and just plain mean sometimes) person that my desire to open up and trust her with my feelings was pretty dang low.   Your husband is probably hesitant to do the same because he doesn't want to be hurt any more. He has learned to live with the old you in a way that keeps him safe, he has to get used to the new you.  He needs to learn to trust you with his feelings and that's probably going to take some time.   I really hope you guys can make it work.     Of course you're sad. You can't trust the man you love and that SUCKS!  The best thing for you to do is to call it off with him and cut all contact. He's proven that he doesn't want a monogamous relationship with you and that he can't be trusted.   Yeah, he says he does, maybe he even thinks this is what he wants but his actions say otherwise. And actions count. Talk is cheap, as they say.   You deserve someone who you can trust and will be honest with you. I know you can find that, it's just not this guy, I'm sorry.   Good luck.    So, number 1, if this is bothering you then you need to talk to him about it. It's unlikely to resolve itself.   But beyond that I don't know that I would automatically assume he's some kind of creep based on the info you've given.   He likes Asian women, that is clear, but is it a bad thing to have a preference?  I'd say as long as your preference doesn't come from some racist viewpoint then it's ok.   All of his GFs have been younger, ok. It is weird that they've all been 7 years younger but that could just be a coincidence. I would be more concerned if he was always going after girls that were of a certain age (like he only dates 24 year olds), that would be weirder to me.   Maybe he is connecting with younger women on a maturity level.   The point is, I would try not to assume the worst about him and have a conversation about his dating past. Don't be accusatory, just ask.   You sound a lot like my (soon to be ex) wife. Except the part about realizing your mistakes, my wife never did that.   If my wife had done that though, and suddenly changed her behavior, I would have been supremely suspicious but also be waiting for her to go back to how things were.   I think everyone else has already given some good advice: couples therapy, make clear your realization and intentions, don't backslide.   Good luck.    Tell your husband he has two choices: either his mother leaves or you (and your son) leave.   Accept no other options. She is toxic both for your son and for your marriage.   Good luck.    I understand and it's not like you can totally cut her off since you have your son in common.   I'd say, for now, continue your policy of only accepting calls about your son while Sarah is around. In fact, if you haven't already, let your ex know that is what is going on.   For the record, in no way am I saying you should start being unfriendly to your ex, but, you can have a cordial and healthy relationship with her without sharing every detail of your life. That's just something you have to decide for yourself.   Good luck.    It's great that you have a friendly relationship with you ex, I'm sure it's very beneficial to your son.   That being said, it sounds like you have a choice to make. Do you want to continue your relationship with Sarah or do you want to have the same level of friendly relationship with your ex?  It sounds like you can't do both. I don't think there's really a wrong answer to the question but you have to decide.   Sarah obviously has some insecurities involving you and your ex and I don't think she will ever be comfortable with the relationship as it stands. She wants to feel more important to you than your ex and she can't do that while you're sharing a LOT of info about your life (things not related to your son). Maybe she's off base with her feelings and she probably needs to explore them more on her own but it's pretty clear that no matter the reason why, this is how she feels.   So, if you want to continue with Sarah I think you're going to have to dial back the friendship with your ex. Limit your conversations to just child-related issues.   If you are 100% unwilling to do that then you need to tell Sarah that things aren't going to change in that regard and she can either accept that or leave. My feeling is that she will leave.    I'm pretty used to it. My cleric was the first character I got to 60 so now if I kill anything faster than that it seems really quick. I guess if I had a TR for my benchmark it'd be a little different.    I play a heal/buff cleric and soloing things takes forever because I'm not set up to do damage. That's just how it is.   On the plus side, I don't die, it just takes awhile.   Soloing I run Chains Of Blazing Light, Daunting Light and Divine Glow. Triple Divinity casting Daunting Light followed by a fully empowered Daunting Light will take an impressive chunk out of most things your going to run into solo.  If you want me to run through in more detail add me on XBox (GT: Jaird) and I'll be happy to help you out.    You need to tell your husband what you've realized about yourself and what you want to change. Let him know how you feel about him.   Also, know that while you have your own issues to deal with (and individual therapy is definitely warranted) it sounds like you guys have some interpersonal issues as well that would benefit from some couples therapy.  Talk to him about it, look into it.  Above all, stop holding everything in. It's not weakness to need help from others.   	16
 I really loved the book Forgive Me Leonard Peacock, anyone know anything similar?    As a teenage girl w/ clinical depression, I loved the movie. I actually found it the opposite of "triggering" in that I could really relate to it.   Then again, it's different for anyone, maybe have her watch the trailer?       My brother too! And me! All hail the gay agenda!    When my grandma passed a few years ago, I would call her cell everyday hoping she'd pick up.       Smh      Just browsing r/all on mobile, haven't looked at this sub any further; I will tonight though    Wow that is amazing, you look great! Keep up the good work   I just took the test and got 94% for Bernie. I'll be honest I didn't know anything about him or his policies before this so thanks!       I hadn't, thanks OP   I'm so sorry for your loss.    I love how the title to 83% of posts in BPT are "white" translations of the image [7]    oh my god I love this    I was there last year too, spent 2 weeks in a hospital. Unfortunately I hadn't started smoking regularly yet so I can't imagine how great that first hit must have felt... keep your chin up! I'm always here if you need someone to talk to or anything Like that :)    where's my ring?   oh my god all of my teachers are wearing "keep calm and keystone on" shirts this week    Lol this is my school, there is no dress code. I just thought It was funny   i regret everything   it's actually a Wonder Years (band) tattoo    what brother? I only see a deer      you must get laid like everyday   	25
 I had this problem too and then I went traveling. Jetlag cured my inability to sleep in!   For pastries I really like [Fujipan]( http://www.fujitop.com.au/shop/fujipan) on Goulburn St. For cakes there is a great shop near the King St side of MLC Centre. You can get them on the day from the window or order ahead like I would usually do.  Best cakes ever.   I agree. We tried our best to have a no kids rule at our wedding but in practicality it didnt work. We had guests flying from interstate and it's hard for them to find a sitter locally. So I hired a few babysitters who entertained them in the bridal room away from the guests. My guests were happy and my husband and I were happy. A small price to pay for my sanity. Ideally I would have preferred no kids though.    Constructive comment. Thanks.   There is also an [NCSS]( http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Computer_Science_School) workshop/class/competition/fun week in Sydney for kids to learn how to code.    Isn't the definition of a boom is that it is a few years of high prices followed by an over supply and saturation of the market and then a natural reduction of the number of suppliers following on from that. i.e. a bust. [Link](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/boom-and-bust-cycle.asp)  The difference is that the mining boom Australia experienced went on for much longer than many other booms, and that Australian politicians didn't capitalize on it by taxing the mining giants enough.   Which brings me to: Should we really be having a budget deficit now and having to make cut backs? We just had one of the longest booms in history...   Yeah fair enough. I hope just being somewhere different is helping you. I get depression and anxiety and find being away from my stressors helps a little.    For crimes less than two years there is an alternate intensive correction order which means you serve your time outside the prison under strict rules. For many people this is a better approach. I guess it depends how severe your crime was and whether it's your first offence. It's not always clear cut.  I think one of the problems with prison is they don't really focus on rehabilitation just punishment. There is no psychological support apart from assessment and drug prescriptions in prison for example. I think this among other things contributes to statistics like this.    Ah I didn't know that. I wasn't thinking of birds in particular but that was probably the context in which I heard that.    Actually I wanted to tell you that I have tried to save a large bird and I think it survived. It was a big Ibis and they're not the prettiest birds but it was on the road with what looked like a broken wing. All the cars were just driving around it and nobody cared. I was sure if I didn't get it someone would run over and kill it. I put on the hazard lights, got a fabric shopping bag I had in the car and took it to the wildlife vets. I think it survived.  I guess it just comes down to making a call. I wouldn't not try to help an animal if I thought I could but if you don't know what you're doing depending on the animal I guess it's also possible to harm them. Sometimes it might be better to call someone who knows what they're doing. We have WIRES in Australia. There might be something similar in other places.    Yeah I was pretty upset that day. They are beautiful little creatures.    Well the thing is I don't know. I know some animals will reject their young if you touch them. I have also heard it's also generally bad to touch fish because you have oil on their scales and you can damage them. I also once handled a little Australian ring tailed possum after I tried to save it from a cat and I covered it with a towel and put it in a box. It physically was fine, with no cuts or anything but then it bit me and a couple of seconds later it died. I was told later that they have weak hearts and sometimes they can die like that.   Anyway I'm no veterinarian so I can't give a good answer but I think some animals have a higher tolerance for human interaction than others.    You're not ugly in the slightest. When I was 16 I went out with a guy who looked like you.    I'm sorry for all the heartache you have had to bear. Hugs. I hope you can find the strength to rebuild your life and make it one that you can enjoy living.    I'm in Sydney. How is life here treating you?    Maybe Kansas   I think it depends on what kind of animal it is   I am also this lazy. I used to work in a building next to a food shop. I would eat regularly and plentifully. We moved to a different building that was about 70 metres away from the food store. I was too lazy to walk to the store so would only get food when I was extremely hungry. I lost about 5kg in 6 months. The problem is my next job had a cafeteria on the top floor.    I don't know if it will work but if you're desperate I suppose it's worth a try.  You could also try to approach recruiters to help you find a job.  You might also want to see if you can get employment by contacting employers directly.  Also I suggest trying out [applydirect.com.au](http://www.applydirect.com.au)   Bowers will get them if you're near Marrickville. Sydney City council will come out Wednesday if you fill out the online form and let them know by Tuesday.   Yep. Got buzzed the other day and knew it was the postie. Ran to the intercom within 10 seconds. No reply. They had already left. Found the little receipt in the mail. Had to wait until following day before I could get the parcel from the post office.    Or unpaid leave in my case.   I have trouble completing the survey because the office girls send our packages, and I don't know how many they send or what it costs :( Sorry!   [The SMH has published an article on this now]( http://www.smh.com.au/nsw/bus-caught-on-fire-in-ashfield-20150519-gh50s8.html)   See if you can get permission to get upstairs in St Mary's Cathedral.   http://photographyhotspots.com.au/photographing-inside-st-marys-cathedral/   I'm so glad I saw this! I was considering getting Optus cable for when we move (I'm on TPG at the moment). Might wait and see if it improves before signing up to a 24 month contract!   http://www.speedtest.net/my-result/4369810446 I'm near the boundary of exchanges too. It's not too bad though.   NIDA also have shorter courses that are worth looking into.   That is the hardest part - getting your deposit/stamp duty together.   There will be younger people who will get payrises faster than inflation, some will even get rises faster than house price rises, but saving for the deposit is the killer.  I worked out for every $10,000 that house prices go up I'd need to save approximately $2,500 toward my 20% deposit and stamp duty costs. If they're going up that much each week then it's just not possible for younger people, even if they are amongst the highest earners.    That show seems pretty interesting! I might have to watch it all the way through.  Is it just me or does the infrastructure look pretty similar to how it is today? Has Sydney been progressing more slowly or is it just less visible?  I mean I know there are probably a lot of new things like the harbour tunnel, a lot of the motorways, a couple of bridges outside the CBD, but the city itself to me looks very familiar. I definitely noticed the shops, cars and trains have changed, and the people look less 80's, but not a lot else. Maybe I am missing something!   First whoever you owe money to, give them a call and ask for an extension. A lot of places will do this for you if you ring in advance of the due date and ask.   Rather than looking at payday loans, why don't you look at Personal Loans from Banks?   Some examples:  * https://www.commbank.com.au/personal/personal-loans.html  * http://www.nab.com.au/personal/campaigns/loans/personal-loans/fy15q2car/index?own_cid=15009-2  * http://www.finder.com.au/personal-loans  Their interest rates should be better.  Also as others have mentioned payday loan companies are the worst. I would avoid them like the plague.  Another option might be a credit card with an interest free period. If you already have a credit card you can do balance transfers that attract 0% interest too. e.g. https://www.hsbc.com.au/1/2/personal/credit-cards/hsbc-credit-card   I don't want to be responsible for fuelling your poor money management, so get that shit under control and don't rely on these types of loans ever again after this ok !!!    I love growing flowers and when I do we get a tonne of bees! I can't tell you how excited I get when I see bees but whenever I see them it is one of the best days of my life. :)   Aw yeah I went with a friend who got a great spot with someone who was really into science! They showed her heaps of cool stuff.  I ended up in a lab with a few women who told me that science was a terrible career and that I shouldn't pursue it unless I want to be poor. They had me clean vials for a whole week. It felt like I should have been on minimum wage. Lucky I like science in spite of that!   ANSTO   Aw that's shit. I like the old trams. The new ones suck.   Yes! My husband is on a work trip to NYC and this is the venue where they had the cocktail reception... so weird!  And I have a few concerns with this aside from the obvious lack of partitions.  * No room for larger bums * Reflective panelling in front of the toilet * Walking past people doing their business to the sink * Only two toilet rolls... and not in easy to reach spots * Lack of female sanitary bins - sorry but a regular bin doesn't cut it. :/  * The toilet roll closest in the picture is positioned right above the flushing button - bad design!  * Lack of smell barriers or scents  Apparently the whole place is new but designed in 007 "Goldfinger" style decor.       I sent you a PM with the details.  Also I forgot to mention that there are some institutions that don't use Mortgage Brokers. For example HSBC, which actually offered a pretty competitive rate. I also checked out CUA (Credit Union Australia) which had a competitive rate (I think mortgage brokers do use these guys but thought I would mention it anyway). Though there are discounts to take into account with the major banks, so you can't always just work off the advertised rate and you need to find out about each one.   Yeah, sorry to say Saturdays have got to be the worst. There is congestion everywhere around there. I cut across from Camperdown to St Peters through the back - via Sydenham, Marrickville   Stanmore. Not much you can do if you're actually heading to Broadway though - and avoid Glebe Point Road - Saturday markets   pedestrian crossings make it a very slow place to drive.   Ah right. Maybe advice wasn't the right word then. But they do usually provide a recommendation - whether they should/shouldn't is another thing.  Like I said though, you need to do your own evaluations - and I'd still do that even if they are licensed.   Well they provide options and make recommendations for a particular loan for you. Why else would you go through them?   Does Newtown have a maccas now? Or did you mean the St Peters one on Princes Hwy? Or the Stanmore one on Parra Rd?   Mid-saturday traffic around there is the worst. Leave early or stay clear (and use back roads)!    People used to say this to me at uni, and I know this is hard to hear, but I'm trying to be helpful... While P's get degrees they don't always get a job. Do your best. You might end up with P's and that's okay if you tried your hardest, but if you can do better, do better dammit.   Reading what you've been through, the things you've overcome are amazing. I would say that shows your resilience and is something that I would admire in a job candidate, rather than be concerned. Though I know not everyone will see it my way.  Like others have said, you don't need to tell people about what happened prior to your degree. They're not allowed to ask you your age in job interviews (due to discrimination reasons), so for all they know, you went through from school to uni. I don't list my high school on my resume. There is no need for that. You went to uni so you obviously finished school. If anyone does ask later just tell them you took a break, or you travelled, or looked after a sick relative, or anything you like really. Nobody needs to know if you don't want them to.    I remember one guy in highschool coming to our school and telling everyone that people will ask you for your ATAR (or UAI as I knew it), for the rest of your life. That's bullshit. If you have a higher education, nobody cares about your school/ATAR ever again. It's getting now to the point employers don't even care about my university education, just my experience.    Yay congrats!    Ah didn't realise you were on a bike!    It's possible that you hate how they're so good...   Go to bed!    Looks pretty interesting - let us know how it goes! I would have gone but I only just found out about it and have stuff on tomorrow   weds.   I guess at least they told you right? I usually assume if I don't get a response within a week or so that they're not interested.   I've been there and done that. It is nerve racking. Don't let anyone make you feel like it's too little. Stick to your guns. If there is anything the mortgage crises have shown us is that banks lend more than they should and significantly underestimate most people's living expenses. Do your sums and stick to your guns.  If you need to try out other mortgage brokers go for it. You can also apply directly with banks. One of the ways I've found mortgage brokers more helpful thank banks is because they educate you, and they also should provide you with advice to narrow down your choices (because there are a lot). That being said, never take someone's advice at face value - I always go and evaluate the options myself. Another thing is that Mortgage Brokers get different commissions (% of loan value) from different lenders, so you should ask them outright what they get, so you can understand if they have any motivation for recommending one over the other.   If you want to try a different broker, I have a pretty good one I would recommend if you want. I tried going through Mortgage Choice too but I didn't feel comfortable with them. Banks were good but only if you know exactly what you're after.  Check out Cannex: http://www.canstar.com.au/home-loans/ They have some tools there that are helpful for evaluating loans. Also check out mozo: e.g. CBA: http://mozo.com.au/rate-and-review/commonwealth-bank/home-loan-reviews for more reviews.  One of the things that you might not realise is that Banks offer a discount if you have the 20% deposit and if you have a higher loan amount and for different brackets they offer different discounts (i.e. the larger the loan the bigger the interest rate discount). If you don't have a high loan amount, then you might consider shopping around for other deals, for example through Credit Unions/Building Societies. A good mortgage broker should be able to help you with this though, so don't worry too much.   Carry a raincoat or umbrella for emergencies.   My worst going home wet experience was when I was in Canada and it snowed for a bit, but then poured down raining while I was up at the top of the mountain. I thought my jacket was waterproof but turns out it is a bit old and lost it's waterproofness. I ended up buying a new t-shirt and wearing a garbage bag before putting all my freezing wet clothing back on over the top and riding the gondola down for about 30 mins before I could reach the hotel and have a warm shower. My whole body was bright red from being so cold and wet. It was brutal.   I guess that shows sometimes you can't prepare, but if you can, do!   Invest in some ugg boots. They are like walking on warm clouds. I love them. They make winter way more bearable.   Does anyone know any good massage places in Sydney? I normally just go and get a voucher through groupon but I need to find something quickly.    15 minutes... that's not enough where I live! 30 mins to an hour!   They don't really know what the problem is but if you think about it logically there are some things which might not be helping.  Avoid products that are harmful to bees. Ever use ant-rid? Don't do that - it says it hurts bees on the packaging. You can put a bit of honey in a container and the ants will get stuck in it. Ever spray insecticide? Use natural products instead. There are lots of them, for example tomato leaves!   Consider buying organic veggies. This means that farmers don't use pesticides heavily. Even your clothes can be produced with pesticides (e.g. cotton), so consider wearing clothes from more sustainable sources.   It all sounds a bit much, so you might not be able to do all that, but consider just doing what you can. But if it means that in future we will still have fruits and vegetables because bees are still around to pollenate them, then I think it's worth it.    It also bothers me when the bathroom that restaurant staff use doesn't have soap. Yuck.   I think some people hold up future boyfriends/girlfriends to incredibly high standards.  You can't expect your partner to be 'perfect'. Nobody is. You're not perfect. Sometimes you're annoying too. The only thing is that you should be able to live with their flaws, just as they need have to accept they will live with yours. Don't envisage a happy ever after. It doesn't work that way. Relationships involve effort, compassion, understanding and kindness.  And if you're a stay at home parent, have a life of your own, don't just revolve your life around your partner and kids. Consider getting a part-time job, or furthering your education. You never know what life will throw at you and you should be able to support yourself if your partner dies, gets ill, etc. Don't take your ability to stay home for granted... a lot of people get screwed over later in life by not preparing for all possible futures.   Just a note because I've looked into it. Having a stand at those markets is very expensive. They also have strict stand requirements.   My car costs me a little more than this. One of the reasons is because I have a thing for good quality tires.  And I seem to have little maintenance issues that pop up like need for new brake pads, suspension (I live near a lot of speedhumps grr), engine mounts, new battery, etc. that goes beyond your standard service. I think it's because my car is getting old.  Just set aside $500 a year for emergency repairs like this stuff.    I know we shouldn't have to but since it's going this way... learn about encryption for your private data.    No problem. Good luck. If you can't find somewhere try air bnb. I have a friend who rents out his extra rooms in Surry hills too. He gets quite a few people who need an interim place while they search for a rental property so airbnb could be an option for you too.   Life really throws some curveballs. I haven't been in your situation and I wouldn't pretend to know what it feels like. I'm really sorry for what you're going through... it sounds tough.  I have had some pretty terrible times. To be honest I didn't cope well at all. Sometimes I wonder how I ever made it out the other side. I guess it comes down to this... that each state is temporary. If I can just make it through A, then I'll think about B, and if I can get through B then I'll think about C. If I can focus on only worrying about one thing at a time, then I can make my problems more manageable. I am a bit of a problem solver, so I have plans, back-up plans and backups for the backup plans. I don't easily give up... but it really can sting when you have tried a lot of different options and are reaching the end of your tether. Sometimes then you need support, or to think about things a little differently. Hopefully you will get through it - sometimes it takes a long time, a lot longer than you might think - but eventually that state will be over and a new one will arrive.  Very few things in life turn out exactly the way you plan, so if life doesn't go to plan then I try to remind myself of that fact. I definitely didn't plan the life I have right now, but it's not better or worse than my plan... just different.   If you ever need someone to talk to give us a buzz. I hope you can find the strength inside yourself to keep fighting.   Nobody has said that exact thing to me, but they've said other things which annoyed me.  Someone told me when I was about 14 before I was even fully aware of my depression myself that I should go on medication. I don't know why but this really irritated me... the fact that I remember this incident nearly 20 years later shows how much.  I just felt like how could they possibly know what I'm going through? I hadn't even talked to anyone about it. I barely knew her. I was just acting a certain way I guess and she noticed. So it was like someone had found my secret. I never reached or asked for help. As a teenager, I was a silent sufferer and nobody could get through to me because I shut everyone out.   At the end of the day I look back and realise that it was probably their way of trying to help, and while I disliked them for years after that, it was mostly unjustified.   I don't find a lot to be comforting but I suppose these days a caring, non-judgemental, open minded listener would do it. I don't often need advice or comforting statements, just a friend. And if I want advice or comforting statements then I'll ask for them.    I've learnt that the level of pain I can cope with is much greater than I ever imagined I would be able to cope with.  I've also learnt compassion. People make mistakes. I make mistakes. I don't condone people's mistakes but I can accept them as that... mistakes. And I don't judge a whole person based on one or two actions. I also believe people do have the ability to change, and everyone is different in how they cope.   However I am also very skeptical of people in general because I have been lied to a lot and taken advantage of, so now I don't trust people easily... mainly to protect myself.   I used to work at a Federal Government agency and quite a few people moved from interstate (all over the country) to work in Sydney.  They all used a rental property service. This was paid for by the government agency. If you can get your work or your partner's work to pay for it that would be ideal, but if not I think the service is worth the money.   I'm sure there are a few around but just do a Google search for it. http://www.sydneyrentalsearch.com.au/  I'd highly recommend it.   That's what gets me. When they grow up their whole life will have been documented online... and have had no say in it.    What are the ABCs of death?   Imagine if somehow we could feed the energy from masturbating back into the electricity grid... we could power cities!   I just Googled the Roads and Maritime Services site to learn about getting a heavy vehicles license. I don't know how I could have sex with a government department.    [Never smile at a crocodile]( http://youtu.be/ZGkdcpTY1QI)   I think Australia does a decent job in general (especially when you look at [Vancouver](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homelessness_in_Vancouver) or [San Fran](http://www.sfchronicle.com/archive/item/A-decade-of-homelessness-Thousands-in-S-F-30431.php) - though in SF's case it's not really their fault but more that there is no National welfare program, and they attracted homeless people there because they were one of the only places in the US who tried to help!) but there is room to do more. It is easy to fall through the cracks, and once you've fallen in, it can be so very hard to crawl back out. Sometimes people get put in emergency housing and then have no long-term follow-on accommodation and only a small percentage find a job that would allow them to support themselves.   My opinion is that in Sydney it comes down to a few things:  * [Abuse Victims](https://www.dss.gov.au/our-responsibilities/housing-support/publications-articles/homelessness-general/homelessness-a-new-approach) - people who leave abusive relationships and homes but have nowhere to go such as children. Apparently [one in 5 people](https://www.dss.gov.au/our-responsibilities/housing-support/publications-articles/homelessness-general/homelessness-a-new-approach) seek emergency accommodation as a result of abuse. A quote from the linked article:   The largest single cause of homelessness however is domestic violence. More than one in five people seeking emergency accommodation are escaping domestic violence. Most victims bring children with them which means they share in the disruption and trauma of being displaced from their home.  * The need for a reasonably well paying job (because Sydney is an expensive place to live, and a lot of homeless people have lower levels of education) * Access to [affordable housing](http://www.ahuri.edu.au/themes/homelessness1) to enable you to work and have a life * [Lack of a personal social support network (family and friends)](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2729873/) * [Mental Health Issues](https://mhaustralia.org/.../MHCA_Home_Truths_Layout_FINAL.pdf) * [Physical Health Issues](http://www.nwhn.net.au/Issues/Health-Homelessness.aspx) * [Addiction](http://www.uq.edu.au/.../docs/Johnson_Chamberlain_2ndAHRC2007.pdf) * [Criminal History](http://posa.org.au/wp-content/uploads/.../CriminalRecordDiscrimination.pdf) - causing issues for finding employment * [Discrimination](https://bullying.humanrights.gov.au/violence-harassment-and-bullying-and-homelessness) - e.g. Aborigines are disproportionately represented in the homeless community.  * [Mental or Physical Disabilities](https://homelessnessclearinghouse.govspace.gov.au/about-homelessness/commonwealth-initiatives/national-homelessness-research/research-release-addressing-homelessness-amongst-persons-with-a-disability-identifying-and-enacting-best-practice-2012-aust/)  Of course there are more reasons, but these I think are some of the main ones.  I also think some people who are vulnerable of becoming homeless aren't aware of the [services](http://www.humanservices.gov.au/customer/subjects/accommodation-renting-and-homelessness) available to them by the government, and also by the [council](http://www.cityofsydney.nsw.gov.au/community/community-support/homelessness), especially as a lot of them have [lower education levels](http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/Lookup/4102.0Main+Features20March+Quarter+2012). Also, when you've reached a low sometimes you're not thinking straight enough to be able to ask for help, and sometimes the help you need isn't available.  There is also [discrimination that occurs based on social status](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/journals/DeakinLawRw/2002/15.html), e.g. once you're homeless or on welfare, making it very difficult to find a job, housing or support.   If you want to do something about it then you could consider volunteering, every bit helps.   I love Peace Lily's. I got mine at Kmart. Just keep them out of direct sunlight because their leaves burn. I think I've seen Mother-in-law's tongue at Kmart too.  I personally don't like English Ivy and quite a few people don't, so [it's hard to find places that sell it](http://www.ourhouseplants.com/plants/ivy). There are [other suggestions here](http://www.growmeinstead.com.au/plant/english-ivy-sa.aspx), though Jasmine is much the same except with a strong scent. I mainly don't like it because it climbs up between gaps in the brickwork and the windows and when the stem thickens it can do a lot of damage. If it's in a pot away from too much sunlight or water though it's fine. I couldn't tell you where you can get it - we had one that took over half the yard of one of my parent's rental properties and it pulled down the gutter, so we had to kill it.   You should be able to get Red-edged dracaena and Chrysanthemum's at Flower Power in Taren Point. Chrysanthemum's are really pretty but they have a really strong scent and produce a lot of pollen which means a lot of people have [allergies](http://www.dermnetnz.org/dermatitis/plants/chrys.html) to them (respiratory and skin). I'm not sure if I would have them indoors but if it's just you and you don't have allergies to it, then it might be fine.    I found the cat and enquired. Apparently it is in country Victoria. Maybe you can let /r/Melbourne or /r/Australia know about the adoption agency. It is so sad to see a life just discarded like that, and I do hope she finds a new home where she is really valued and loved.   Did you see where abouts in QLD she is? I may know someone who might be interested!    Did you ever have a golliwog doll? I did. Once upon a time it wasn't considered racist, except the original author failed to trademark the character, and poor Golly was exploited. :(  [This article](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1136016/How-golliwog-went-innocent-childrens-hero-symbol-bitter-controversy.html) explains the rise and fall of Golliwog.   I was on the phone once when a spider like this crawled down my arm. I was surprised, then the spider was surprised at my surprise, the person on the phone was confused, but neither me or the spider were hurt by the incident. It didn't even try to bite me. I think there was just general fear all round.   Did you guys read the [Old Shops of Sydney](http://www.smh.com.au/interactive/2014/OldShops/) page? My mum drives out of her way to go to that butcher in Como. She loves it. She's known the family since she was a kid - it's been a profession passed down through generations. Give a couple of the shops on the list a visit! You won't be disappointed.   Amazon. They do different lengths too if you're not the average height.    I'd suggest staying somewhere near Town Hall train station. It's a very central station. Mantra hotels has some decent serviced apartments there which are great. If you want more of a Darling Harbour view try the Ibis or Novotel which should be a bit cheaper. Circular Quay is great but more expensive.   I'd suggest that locking up in the day is okay but not at night. Can you lock it indoors somewhere? If you're going to a restaurant maybe see if they'll let you lock it out the back of their restaurant.   I'm pretty sure it's not that sporty but my first car was a Nissan Pulsar. Very cheap to run as it was mass produced. In it's time it actually won some NRMA cheapest car to run award. I'm sure there are other suggestions from other people, but I think it was a great first car.   I agree that less commuting is the way to go. Wouldn't it be great if we'd have some kind of high speed internet that would make not commuting into the city a viable option for some people? I can't even find the date when it will be rolled out to many places I looked into buying.  Last year, I was working with a company in the US and still couldn't work at home because my internet is too crap, so I head into the city office where they have a better connection. :/   As someone in a tech role I should be able to work from home around 70% of the time, but until home internet speeds are better I will be forced into the office.    How big are the fuel tanks on these buses? Does it have to refuel after the single trip?   Lol. I don't mind. They're usually more uncomfortable than me anyway. :)   What if they're too fat for one seat and require two? :D   Hello NSW!    Who are these people who destroy bees! I wanted to put ant rid down because we had so many ants but I discovered that ant rid is also bad for bees so I decided to leave them all bee. Now we all live in harmony and I have pretty flowers.   Walking is great. I have also skateboarded to work a few times. Commuting done right can actually be fun! :)   Have you tried the new trams? The seats at the ends are impossible to sit in straight and I'm not even tall. I'd rather stand any day.    Yup: http://www.reddit.com/r/sanfrancisco/comments/307wx0/guy_is_shooting_heroin_right_in_front_of_me_on/   I wouldn't call what I wrote whining. It's my guess at why 3 buses might have come at once.    Catching the bus in the seat next to a homeless person who literally smells like shit.  Still not as bad as San Fran right? People shooting up on the bus?   I've thought about this intently but I live very close to the bus depot which doesn't help to explain this! My guess is they deliberately do it so they can leapfrog each other and only have to stop at every 2nd stop.  Just to explain further, by the time the bus is at my stop all 3 of the buses are usually empty.     Canberra was nice when I was there a couple of weeks ago. So pretty! So many maple trees :)   I can't tell you about what the grade should be but I'd recommend just applying and seeing if they accept you, even if you're not sure if they will. I transferred degrees and I didn't think they'd let me but they did! It's worth a shot anyway.  	95
 right...because knowing the truth about feminism is suddenly weak-minded and you guys are the ones being coddled (sheltered from reality), taught that you need special treatment and what not and you are just projecting all that hatred onto us  dude, I know far more things (in math, social studies and science mainly but probably even more on other subjects too) than you   I've thought of that but it means you still have to play without throwing, right?   I mean reaching level 6 is fast and easy (maybe not so much for jungle) and early game was nerfed  also, you can win early game but will not finish the game fast enough so that weak early-strong late game champions catch back up?   are these asexuals female or non-binary?  I mean it doesn't even count because asexuals can also be bad people (especially since we have such small population, any few people is considerably alot)  but really, you are avoiding the question: provide examples in which feminism has helped anyone, including asexuals.   since you claim you have examples, why don't you show them?  also, it proves that there are bad feminists out there that discriminate against asexuals   ahh a victim telling others that they have a victim complex   my point exactly   right...  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL4KQ6_npw0   hypocrite, you guys are just basically the same as these feminists attacking an asexual that she deserved to be raped you guys are basically doing the same yourselves and insist that NAFALT, good job proving your statements  http://dontneedfeminism.com/post/78589971327/abbeyxmae-serebrii   I'm not blaming women (not all women are feminists) nor anyone  I'm criticizing some feminists for attacking some asexuals and that well feminism in general should go away but also if it doesn't, at least it should correct itself by calling out 'the bad feminists' and should stay away from LGBTQIA issues   https://youtu.be/CF5wrM2Osqk?t=3m34s  if you're hiding behind dictionary definition then feminists can also be defined as terrorists: the use of violence and intimidation in the pursuit of political aims   http://tryingtomakesenseofpeople.tumblr.com/post/113807401152/okay-what-you-dont-understand-is-that-feminism  These are being done by 'official' feminist groups (such as UN Women): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrxEnQPgouc  are you really going to sit here and tell me that they aren't real feminists too?  and I'm not trying to erase nb but men and women alone make up up to 99.7% of population...  also, MGTOW is not the counterpart to feminism, MRA is and they are 2 diff movements   thanks for agreeing with me and that may be but feminism is fairly clear that it is anti-man or terrible in many ways, this is just one of the ways  also take a look at here: http://dontneedfeminism.com/post/78589971327/abbeyxmae-serebrii   look you people are trivializing matters that are important and harsher struggles for people who truly face discrimination, rejection or other actions that involve not wanting them  Now I support problems that can happen in the first world but you guys spread misinformation that it makes us look like tools: Transgenders who are denied of their desired gender for example, but no you guys claim/make it seem that gender is a choice.  In fact, there are people that have it far worse (typically third world countries): -Rohingya people are the most oppressed group of people and right now they are stateless and living in boats in the middle of nowhere -women are victims of acid attacks in many South East Asian nations and much more  in conclusion, you people have the audacity to trivialize everyone's matters over yours?   tell that to the feminists...o wait   really are you going to do this??  http://tryingtomakesenseofpeople.tumblr.com/post/113807401152/okay-what-you-dont-understand-is-that-feminism   http://tryingtomakesenseofpeople.tumblr.com/post/113807401152/okay-what-you-dont-understand-is-that-feminism   Seems no one can find it and it's not a big deal equation  It's basically like proving the gaussian integral is specific value, which one cannot do without multivariable calculus, something along those lines.  	18
